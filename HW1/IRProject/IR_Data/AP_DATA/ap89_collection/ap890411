   ``Work to Start At Once on Two Forks Reservoir,''
proclaimed a headline in The Denver Post 61 years ago, touting a
project that would free the city from worry about future water
supplies.
   That 1928 report proved to be a bit optimistic. Not an ounce of
concrete has been poured at the proposed dam site on the South
Platte River 25 miles southwest of Denver.
   And now the federal Environmental Protection Agency may be about
to scuttle the dam, whose cost has ballooned from $6 million in
1928 to current estimates of $500 million to $1 billion.
   In an unusual move, EPA Administrator William Reilly began the
veto process on the 1.1 million acre-foot dam project March 24. He
said it simply was too costly environmentally: It would inundate a
gold-medal trout stream and possibly damage a Nebraska wildlife
habitat.
   Dam supporters can make a final appeal to save the project. EPA
spokesman Rich Lathrop said the review process could continue
through December.
   Although the city has adequate supplies at least through the
next quarter century, its leaders haven't decided where to turn for
water beyond that if Two Forks is defeated.
   ``We planned well and there's no crisis,'' said Monte Pascoe,
president of the Denver Water Board, which spent decades developing
the proposal.``We're trying to plan equally well for the next 25
years, and we're being told we can't do that.''
   The city currently diverts mountain water across the Continental
Divide from the Rockies' Western Slope.
   The dam has been touted by supporters as the best solution to
the area's future water needs.
   Opponents, such as National Audubon Society President Peter
Berle, have called the dam an ``environmental and economic
monstrosity'' that would destroy scenic Cheesman Canyon in Colorado.
   They also say it would alter the South Platte's flow downstream
into Nebraska and affect fragile habitat for 240 species of
migrating birds, including the endangered whooping crane and the
sandhill crane.
   Two Forks, just downstream from the confluence of the South
Platte and its North Fork, would stand 615 feet _ about half the
height of the Empire State Building _ and would be 1,700 feet long,
and from 160 to 467 feet thick. By comparison, Hoover Dam, one of
the highest concrete dams in the world, is 726 feet tall astride
the Colorado River and 1,244 feet long with a 660-foot thick
concrete base.
   Hoover Dam's reservoir, Lake Mead, on the Arizona-Nevada border,
stores about 29.7 million acre-feet of water _ one acre-foot is
enough water to cover one acre to a depth of one foot _ and covers
about 255 square miles.
   Two Forks, however, would store only 1.1 million acre-feet. It
would cover 13.28 square miles and the small community of Deckers.
   Denver leaders have considered a dam on the river since 1896 and
the city began acquiring land for the project in 1923.
   The most recent attempt to build a dam intensified in 1981 when
the Denver Water Board asked the Army Corps of Engineers to study
the dam's potential environmental impact.
   In 1986, the board and the Metropolitan Water Providers, a group
of 42 suburban water suppliers, formally applied for a construction
permit.
   The Corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment in 1987
that identified Two Forks as the most environmentally damaging of
seven proposed dams on the river, but it also said Two Forks was
the most cost-effective way to meet the area's water needs into the
21st century.
   Metropolitan officials are making contingency plans in addition
to continuing the fight for Two Forks, and the Denver Water Board
last week formalized water restrictions. Under the new policy,
Denver may decide each September whether to restrict additional
water connections outside city limits, and may implement rate
increases in Denver and the suburbs to which it sells water.
   Most of the cities in the metropolitan area purchase water from
Denver.
   Pascoe said the board has an adequate supply to meet needs in
Denver in the immediate future but ``there's no room for error.''
   ``We honestly don't think other supplies for water will be very
easy to find,'' he said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a padlocked shed near the old royal
palace, the limousine of the last Afghan king waits in the dust.
   The black Daimler's tires are flat, but the silver royal crest
on the door is untarnished.
   The car is an apt symbol for Zahir Shah, the 74-year-old exile
whose return is talked about by Afghans across the political
spectrum as a way of ending the decade-old civil war between an
authoritarian government and Moslem fundamentalists.
   Sixteen years after he was deposed, the ex-king remains a symbol
of better days _ of a time when Afghans were not slaughtering each
other in horrific numbers.
   The problem is finding a way for him to return.
   ``The car is ready for him. It would be good if he came back,''
said a man who knew the whereabouts of Zahir Shah's Daimler.
   Then, looking around even though no one else was within hearing
distance, the slender university graduate added: ``Please don't
write my name.''
   Others are less fearful.
   ``If King Zahir Shah wants to work for his country, he can have
a positive role in bringing peace,'' said Wadir Safi, dean of law
and political science at Kabul University.
   ``Even if he didn't do much for the progress of our country, he
didn't kill anybody,'' said Safi, who studied at Czechoslovakia's
Charles University.
   About a month ago, Safi's views were published in a new weekly
newspaper, the Akbar-e-Hafta. The article was accompanied by the
first photograph of the former king that Kabul residents can
remember seeing published in the government-supervised media since
Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973.
   The issue quickly sold out, although its price of 20 cents is
four or five times that of other newspapers. Even illiterate people
scrambled for copies.
   ``All the people like Zahir Shah,'' a shopkeeper said on
condition of anonymity. ``In Zahir Shah's time there was not
killing of people,'' the father of 10 added.
   Even President Najib, a former secret police chief, has said
talks with the ex-king could be useful. In mid-February, Najib said
he had sent emissaries to Zahir Shah's exile home in Italy. A
spokesman for the aging ex-monarch promptly denied any contacts
with Najib's Soviet-style regime.
   U.S.-backed Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, operating from
headquarters across the border in Pakistan, are divided about
reinstating the monarchy.
   Any future role in Afghanistan for Zahir Shah has been rejected
by hard-liners among the rebels, such as Rasul Sayyaf, leader of
one of the seven parties in the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance.
Some moderate leaders, such as Ahmad Gailani who once served as the
king's religious adviser, say they would accept his return as a
constitutional monarch, a sort of living flag to help unite the
Afghan people.
   The king himself seems amenable.
   In early February, as the Soviet Union was withdrawing its last
soldiers from Afghanistan and ending nine years of combat support
for the Kabul government, Zahir Shah said:
   ``I am prepared to render without any claim or precondition any
service to my country which would reflect the will of the majority
of my compatriots.''
   The sticky question is how to reconcile the poles-apart politics
of Najib's People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the rebels'
Islamic fundamentalism and a monarchy.
   The rebels refuse to deal with the party, whose communist
beginnings never took root among the fervently capitalist Afghans.
The party, whose leadership changes have come only through coup,
assassination or purge, says it is willing to ``share'' power but
will never step aside completely.
   In four decades on the throne, Zahir Shah himself proved a less
than dynamic leader.
   He was only 19 in 1933 when he became king upon the
assassination of his father, Nadir Shah. For the next 20 years his
uncles ran the country.
   In 1953, his cousin, Mohammad Daoud, became prime minister and
tried to push a feudalistic, tribal nation toward the 20th century
by such means as freeing women of their all-enveloping robes.
   In 1963, Zahir Shah finally exerted himself. Daoud resigned,
waited a decade, and overthrew his cousin the king.
   Five years later, in 1978, Daoud was assassinated in a coup that
brought the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan to power with
a succession of leaders.
   Since then about 1 million Afghans have been killed in the war.
Another 5 million have fled to neighboring Paistan and Iran,
leaving Afghanistan with a population of 10 million.
   Throughout the war, Zahir Shah's Daimler, a car that is somehow
sleek and bulky at the same time, has been unscathed.
   Periodically it is dusted by a man with only childhood memories
of the monarchy, a man who does not want to give his name and hopes
the car remains safe until the king returns.
   The Daimler waits, along with five other royal automobiles, in a
simple white-washed structure behind the national museum, abou 300
yards from the early 20th century Darulaman Palace which now houses
the defense ministry.

<TEXT>
   A fire erupted Monday at a Chevron oil
refinery plant, injuring at least seven workers and sending
100-foot flames shooting into the sky.
   The fire apparently started at 12:46 p.m. when an explosion
shook a 100-foot-tall column in a refinery processing plant where
gasoline is manufactured, said Hal Holt, a Chevron spokesman.
   Thick black smoke and flames rose into the sky as about 40
firefighters from Chevron and the city of Richmond battled the
blaze, which was declared under control about four hours later,
Holt said.
   ``The fire is still burning and we have not been able to get in
to assess the cause or the totality of damage,'' said Holt, who
refused to estimate a damage amount.
   Three Chevron operators were flown to Brookside Hospital in San
Pablo where a hospital spokesman said they were in stable condition
with second degree burns. One man suffered burns over 70 percent of
his body and the other two had burns over 20 percent to 30 percent
of their bodies.
   Another Chevron operator was taken to Doctor's Hospital in
Pinole, where he was reported in stable condition after being
treated for smoke inhalation, according to the nursing supervisor.
   Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley reported that one Chevron fire
marshal was admitted with second degree burns on his face, ears and
neck and was having respiratory difficulties, said hospital
spokeswoman Carolyn Kemp.
   At least two other people were reported injured but there was no
immediate word on the extent of their injuries.
   The facility is Chevron's second largest refinery on the West
Coast and produces about 265,000 barrels of crude oil daily.

<HEAD>Praise arrest of Mexican drug kingpin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition politicians and U.S. officials
praised Mexican authorities for the capture of a drug czar believed
to control more than half of the cocaine shipped through Mexico to
the United States.
   Authorities seized some of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo's assets
Monday, including a hotel, pharmacy, real-estate company, bank
accounts and various properties. Felix Gallardo, 43, was arrested
Saturday night in Guadalajara.
   No value was placed on the assets confiscated Monday, but Felix
Gallardo's net worth is estimated to exceed $500 million, including
at least 50 houses and 200 ranches.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, at a news
conference Monday, called Felix Gallardo ``the No. 1 drug
trafficker in Mexico.''
   He said that others arrested in the weekend raids included three
of Felix Gallardo's aides as well as the chief federal anti-drug
official and five other ranking police officers in Sinaloa, Felix
Gallardo's home state.
   ``We congratulate the judicial police for the apprehension of
the drug czar and we praise the role of the military in Sinaloa,
where they detained police involved in drug trafficking,'' Alberto
Noyola, spokesman for the conservative National Action Party, told
the government news agency Notimex.
   Cesar Yanez, a leader of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary
Party, told Notimex: ``We hope that this not only affects the
circulation of drugs but that it attacks the problem starting with
production,''
   Alvarez noted that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took
office in January, has vowed to stop drug dealing and corruption.
   The raids were the third dramatic example of Salinas'
determination. In January he put the corrupt leader of the oil
workers' union behind bars and in February a leading stockbroker
went to jail.
   Ed Heath, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
Mexico, told reporters, ``The message ... is that President Salinas
de Gortari means business.''
   ``To pull this thing off the way it was done is a tribute'' to
Mexican authorities, he added. ``The impact it has on the drug
market, we can say, is extremely significant.''
   Felix Gallardo, thought to head a ring that smuggled up to 4
tons of cocaine a month into the United States, had been sought for
years but ``obtained protection from diverse authorities,'' Alvarez
said.
   Heath said Felix Gallardo ``was as important as any major
trafficker in South America'' and ``has been operating almost with
impunity in Mexico because of the protection he received.''
   U.S. authorities believe Felix Gallardo was involved in the 1985
slaying of American drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar. But
Alvarez said Felix Gallardo opposed killing Camarena and that his
office had no evidence linking him directly to the killing.
   Alvarez added, however, that Felix Gallardo was the
``intellectual author'' of the organization that killed Camarena.
   Camarena was kidnapped outside the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara
in 1985 and tortured and killed.
   While Federal judicial police were arresting Felix Gallardo in
the western state of Jalisco soldiers detained every police officer
on the 80-member force in Culiacan, Felix Gallard's hometown and
the capital of Sinaloa state in northwest Mexico.
   Alvarez said federal authorities did not trust the police in
Sinaloa and wanted to avoid a shootout. Most of the officers were
quickly released, he said.
   Felix Gallardo purportedly had an alliance with Colombia's
Medellin Cartel to move cocaine into the United States.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Revitalizing Women's Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat to legalized abortion has infused
the women's movement with a passion and purpose unmatched since the
determined but losing campaign to ratify the equal rights amendment.
   Women are turning out, joining up and writing checks in what one
organizer called ``a torrent of activity'' provoked by the Supreme
Court's decision to re-examine Roe vs. Wade, its 1973 ruling that
legalized abortion.
   ``It's like spontaneous combustion or a prairie fire,'' said
Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., co-chairman of the Congressional
Caucus on Women's Issues.
   The throngs that turned out for Sunday's abortion rights march
were only the most visible aspect of an energized movement.
   March organizers report their contributions have risen 50
percent in recent months. One group, the National Abortion Rights
Action League, raised $600,000 in March 1989 _ five times as much
as the previous March. New members in February and March amounted
to double the entire number of people who joined NARAL throughout
1988.
   Another major beneficiary has been the National Organization for
Women. Once the undisputed leader of the women's movement, NOW
after the 1982 ERA defeat was just one of many groups with separate
interests. Its membership fell, its finances suffered and its
activist, grassroots tactics were spurned in favor of an insiders'
strategy of ``playing the game.''
   But NOW has gained 18,000 members in the past few months, said
president Molly Yard. Its fiscal health has improved dramatically
as a result of the abortion rights mobilization. And the march,
initially scheduled to kick off a new NOW campaign for ERA, has
raised its profile considerably.
   Many feminists acknowledge their movement had been in a slump,
successful through the 1980s only in staving off threats to ground
they had thought was secure. For example, women's groups were part
of the broader coalition that helped defeat Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork and pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act over
then-President Reagan's veto.
   But for the most part, women's groups in the post-ERA movement
went their separate ways. Some raised money for feminist
candidates, some lobbied for family or economic bills on Capitol
Hill. NARAL continued its abortion rights campaign, NOW its pursuit
of the ERA.
   Until the threat to abortion rights, ``there wasn't that kind of
eye on the prize that a movement needs,'' said Frances Kissling,
president of Catholics for a Free Choice.
   While acknowledging the backhanded contribution the conservative
Reagan and Bush administrations have made to their movement,
feminist leaders say they don't consider the Roe vs. Wade threat a
boon or a necessity.
   ``It has mobilized both human resources and money. It's
providing energy and fuel to the movement,'' said Judith Lichtman,
president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. ``But it wasn't a
dying movement. It's an extraordinarily diverse movement with quite
powerful leadership. We didn't need an attack on Roe vs. Wade to be
a strong movement.''
   NOW's moment in the spotlight cast by the massive abortion march
may pass, but feminist leaders say the energy activated by the
abortion threat will continue on that front and spill over to
others.
   ``It will certainly revive the reproductive freedom movement and
it will go well beyond where it's been before,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of NARAL. Noting the new involvement
of labor unions, doctors, civil rights groups and religious groups,
she said ``the coalition to preserve this right is much bigger and
broader than ever before in the '70s and '80s.''
   Many leaders spoke optimistically of the college students from
some 450 campuses who came to the march. ``This is going to be the
issue that brings them into the political process,'' said
Michelman. ``It's going to galvanize them to care about public
policy and legal rights and civil rights. It will have a spinoff
effect.''
   The women also cited a renewed resolve to hold politicians
accountable on a wide range of women's concerns. ``People were here
for abortion because there's an immediate threat,'' said Lichtman.
``But they lobbied on Monday not just on abortion but on child
care, family leave and the minimum wage. They're going to use their
political chits with Congress.''
   Most groups are likely to continue the present focus on abortion
and family issues such as child care, which concern women on an
intensely personal level. But NOW intends to renew its quest for
the ERA, despite the difficulties of building steam for what is
perceived as a losing issue.
   Yard said NOW doesn't need a lot of people to build a solid
legislative record at congressional hearings, the first phase of
what she sees as a 10-year effort. And she said congressional
passage can wait until more women are elected to the state
legislatures that must ratify the amendment.
   While some women consider legal abortion the fundamental right
women need to participate fully in society, Yard said NOW members
believe the bottom line is the ERA. ``We're never going to let the
ERA go,'' she said. ``We're very concerned about other issues, but
at rock bottom, you have to have the equal rights amendment to
protect the rights you win.''

   An emotionally disturbed man screaming ``I'm
going to kill you'' swung a machete at pedestrians and police on a
crowded midtown Manhattan street before an officer shot and killed
him Monday, police said.
   Four police officers and a sergeant tried to stop the man by
spraying mace and shooting him with a stun gun but both failed to
slow him down, said police Inspector James McCabe.
   ``They all did cartwheels to prevent having to shoot him,'' said
Officer Richard O'Neill of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
``The guy just wanted to die and nothing was going to stop him.''
   ``He kept screaming, ``You're going to have to kill me or I'm
going to kill you,'' O'Neill said.
   The man, whose identity was not known, was shot at 2:30 p.m. by
26-year-old Officer Robert Masucci of Staten Island when he lunged
at the officer from a distance of three feet with the 18-inch long
machete, McCabe said.
   The victim, shot once in the upper chest and once above the
navel, staggered across the street and collapsed. He died an hour
later at Bellevue Hospital, said police spokesman Detective James
Coleman.
   ``We did everything humanly possible to contain him,'' McCabe
said. ``Every time police asked him to drop the knife he said he
would not drop it.''

<HEAD>State Department Reverses Itself, OKs Coast Guard Band's Soviet Appearance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a policy reversal, the State Department has
agreed to let the U.S. Coast Guard Band perform this June at a
Leningrad concert commemorating last year's U.S.-Soviet arms treaty.
   Earlier this year, the Leningrad City Council invited the
Connecticut-based military band to play with the Leningrad Military
District Band in a joint concert June 22 in honor of the first
anniversary of the treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow embraced the idea, according to Rep.
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., but higher-level officials in Washington
rejected it without explanation.
   Gejdenson and officials at the Coast Guard Academy in New
London, Conn., protested the State Department decision to scuttle
the trip.
   In a letter last month to Janet G. Mullins, the department's
legislative liaison, Gejdenson said he could not understand ``what
reason could possibly exist for refusing this gracious and generous
invitation during this period of excellent relations.''
   The State Department told Gejdenson on Monday that the trip was
back on.
   ``The band shows the best of America,'' the congressman said.
``The Russian people will love it.''
   One source said State Department officials feared the trip would
interfere with a concurrent visit by U.S. military officials and
were uneasy about the idea of having an American military unit
performing in the Soviet Union.
   But Gejdenson said he believes the reluctance stems from the
problems Americans have with responding to glasnost, the Soviets'
new policy of openness.
   ``It's just symbolic of the difficulty of the new opportunities
in the relationship with the Soviet Union. Even the simplest and
smallest symbol that they're willing to try ... was a major hurdle
to get across,'' Gejdenson said.
   Ms. Mullins and State Department officials for Soviet affairs
could not be reached for comment following Gejdenson's
announcement, which came late Monday afternoon.
   Leningrad officials are paying for the band's hotel, meals and
local transportation, Gejdenson said. The U.S. government has to
supply air travel to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Yeutter Defends Trade Agreement with Europeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
U.S. negotiators held the line during trade talks in Geneva last
week, regardless of how the final agreement is worded.
   Moreover, he said, the U.S. export subsidy program _ which
provides reduced prices for selected commodities in certain
overseas markets _ was a key factor in putting leverage into the
negotiations, particularly in getting approval from the European
Economic Community.
   The EEC had balked at the earlier U.S. insistence that all
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the long
haul. The agreement reached in Geneva by more than 100 countries
calls for a ``substantial progressive reduction'' in such subsidies.
   Yeutter, in an interview Monday with a group of reporters, said
the Europeans objected to earlier language calling for the
``elimination'' of the subsidies and later to a modified
``ratcheting'' down of them.
   Asked if the final language represented backtracking on the part
of the United States in its quest to do away with trade-distorting
subsidies and other practices, Yeutter replied: ``I don't consider
it backtracking at all.''
   He maintained that there is no practical difference between
``elimination'' or ``ratcheting'' or the accepted ``substantial
progressive reduction'' of subsidies, regardless of what some
European leaders may feel.
   ``They may have their own reasons for articulating the outcome
of the meeting as they have,'' Yeutter said. ``Obviously, everyone
will go home and, to some degree, at least, articulate their own
interpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs.''
   The accord reached in Geneva provides a framework for further
discussions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a
four-year effort called the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize
global trade. The current GATT round will conclude at the end of
1990.
   As part of the Geneva agreement, participants agreed to an
overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990.
   Yeutter said the U.S. goal is to gain long-term accord on the
future of agricultural trade and that the short-term agreement
reached in Geneva, while acceptable, was no big challenge for U.S.
negotiators.
   Some American farm leaders, including Dean Kleckner of the
American Farm Bureau Federation, had urged Congress to proceed
writing a new general farm bill on an assumption that little
progress could be expected under the GATT talks.
   Yeutter said he had no objection to Congress proceeding with a
new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year.
And Yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislation
until it was clearer how the GATT talks would shape up.
   ``Somehow that got misinterpreted ... because that's not really
what I meant at all,'' Yeutter said.
   ``Assuming that (GATT) negotiations are a success, the 1990 farm
legislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991,'' he
said. ``But I never meant to indicate that we shouldn't have
full-scale farm legislation in 1990.''
   On the matter of U.S. export subsidies used in the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, Yeutter said it is ``our view that we
are not constrained on EEP expenditures.''
   Yeutter said further that he still favors Congress removing the
lid on EEP spending so that the United States can match the
unrestrained export subsidies of the Europeans. The program, he
said, was a major factor in reaching the agreement in Geneva last
week, along with aggressive negotiating and general leverage.
   ``In the absence of this combination of leverage _ with the EEP
program providing a great deal of that leverage _ we very likely
would not have an agreed framework in Geneva today,'' Yeutter said.
   In a written statement later, Yeutter repeated his earlier
insistence that the United States ``will continue to aggressively
seek elimination of trade-distorting measures'' during the
remainder of the Uruguay Round.
   A background sheet said that in the short-term the United States
``in a general way'' is committed not to increase price support and
protection for American farmers.
   Specifically, it said, ``We are committed not to intensify
market access barriers or raise support prices to producers,
subject to the condition that the commitment be consistent with
existing legislation.''
   The paper added: ``Our assessment is that this will not require
us to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990,
our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.''

<HEAD>Kemp Plans Effort to Evict Drug Dealers from Public Housing Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp says his proposals to get drugs out of District of Columbia
housing projects can be followed in the rest of the nation, too.
   Kemp on Monday proposed actions against drugs in the federally
supported housing projects of the nation's capital, including more
police patrols, installing security fences and guarded entrances,
and requiring photo identification cards for residents.
   He announced the moves as part of the federal government's drug
crackdown in the District of Columbia, but said the proposals ``are
appropriate and will be suggested'' to every public housing
authority in the nation.
   ``I'm asking today the D.C. police chief and the public housing
authority of D.C., along with public housing authorities around the
country, to engage in those type of operations that can clear out
and secure public housing projects from drug users and abusers and
dealers,'' Kemp said.
   In the nation's capital, Kemp said he would waive HUD grievance
hearing requirements that can delay evictions from public housing
for months. Kemp took steps recently to remove those requirements
in Virginia.
   Kemp outlined his plan at a news conference where national drug
policy director William J. Bennett and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh announced a major new effort to combat drugs in the
nation's capital.
   Kemp said local police and public housing authorities should
issue photo identification cards to residents of federally
supported housing projects so that legitimate residents can be
distinguished from outsiders.
   He said security guards would be trained and ``a better presence
of public housing and city police'' would be provided. A part of
the effort would be a general cleanup of projects, including
removal of graffiti.
   Kemp acknowledged that many of the steps are things HUD should
be doing anyway, and said many of the proposals were based on
successful tests by local housing authorities at projects in
Chicago, Omaha and elsewhere.
   He said he would finance the anti-drug effort with existing
money appropriated for public housing rehabilitation and operating
subsidies. He put no price tag on the effort.
   ``If it's not enough, I'll ask Congress for a supplemental''
appropriation, he said.
   Lucy Franklin, spokeswoman for Washington D.C.'s Department of
Public and Assisted Housing, which operates the city's public
housing projects, said city housing officials were discussing
Kemp's proposal and had no immediate response.
   But she said the district is already issuing photo cards to
residents of high-rise projects for senior citizens. Most units for
other residents are apartments or town houses, she said, and use of
the cards is ``a much different issue'' for families.
   She said the district already has asked HUD for more money to
pay for 100 additional housing guards and for more security fences.
   Kemp said HUD also will:
   _Ask U.S. attorneys to seize the apartments of drug dealers and
return them to the public housing authorities.
   _Seek ways to terminate federal housing subsidies, such as HUD
vouchers and housing certificates, for anyone convicted of using or
selling drugs.
   _Attempt to reclaim vacant units sometimes used by drug dealers
and abusers, and enforce housing codes and standards.
   _Encourage resident management of public housing projects.
   _Establish an anti-drug hotline to encourage residents to make
confidential reports on drug-related crimes.
   _Encourage youth sports leagues in the projects to steer
youngsters away from drugs.

<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias interrupted
his North American trip to visit his ailing mentor, former
President Jose Figueres.
   ``I come to see my friend, one of the greatest leaders that
Costa Rica and Latin America has ever had,'' Arias told reporters
Monday as he entered San Jose de Dios Hospital in the nation's
capital.
   ``When his health failed, we realized how much Don Pepe meant to
us,'' said the president, who was to later resume his trip to the
United States and Canada.
   Figueres, 83, has been hospitalized since Friday with a heart
ailment. Although doctors initially said they feared his death was
imminent, by Monday they said he had improved considerably.
   All day long, hundreds of people called the hospital to ask
about the health of the former president affectionately known as
Don Pepe. Figueres was president of Costa Rica three times and in
1948 abolished the army.
   At a recent public event Arias confessed that ``Don Pepe is like
my second father and has been my political guide.'' Both men belong
to the National Liberation Party, which Figueres founded in 1953.
   ``I want to tell all of you that I am glad to find Don Pepe so
well and I think he is recovering quickly,'' Arias told reporters.
``He always has encountered force against adversity in his life and
that force has come from God.''
   Arias refused to comment to journalists on his tour of North
America and his debt talks with U.S. and Canadian officials.

<HEAD>Lead Found in Same Model Water Coolers Used by Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water fountains with excessive levels of lead
because of tanks lined with the toxic metal are being used at
elementary and secondary schools, and more than 100 models have
unhealthy levels, the government says.
   The exact number of coolers with the lead-lined tanks is not
known, but the Environmental Protection Agency did say that more
than a million other coolers are in use that have lead soldering or
lead in some other form.
   Although the EPA lacks the authority to order lead testing in
schools, a law enacted last year requires states to begin a program
to assist school districts in testing for lead in drinking water.
Many such programs are under way.
   EPA officials also said Monday they would soon issue a detailed
guide for school officials on how to testfor unhealthy lead levels,
and the agency listed more than 100 manufacturers' model numbers
for fountains in which lead levels were found to be of concern.
   The EPA said Monday it discovered the lead-lined tanks while
inspecting 22 coolers provided by the Navy. The nine with
lead-lined tanks were all models like those used in schools.
   Those coolers, all made by Halsey Taylor Co., mostly had lead
levels of more than several hundred parts per billion, the EPA
said. In some cases, when long-standing water was tested, the level
was more than 1,000 parts per billion, the EPA said.
   The EPA considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion in water
to pose health risks especially if a child is exposed to lead
poisoning from other sources as well.
   Lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low
levels of exposure and poses increased risks to children. It can
cause damage to the brain and nervous system and lead to learning
disabilities, hearing impairment, and interference in the formation
of red blood cells, according to the EPA.
   ``There are a few hundred thousand children who have enough lead
from other sources so when lead from drinking water is added at
levels of 20 parts per billion there will be some adverse health
impact,'' said Mike Cook, head of the EPA water contamination
office, in an interview.
   The agency also said that three major manufacturers of school
water coolers have acknowleged that more than a million coolers
have some lead components _ usually lead soldering at joints. Two
other companies did not reply to the inquiries and another said it
manufactured no coolers with lead soldering.
   The agency gave no specific levels of lead in water from all the
coolers cited by model numbers, but said the coolers were singled
out only after levels were found to be in the unhealthy range.
   After the EPA issues a final list of coolers with lead-lined
tanks later this year, the Consumer Products Safety Commission
intends to seek their recall by the manufacturer, said David
Schmeltzer, director of compliance at the commission.
   EPA officials said that school water fountains likely account
for only a ``very small'' part of the lead exposure that faces
youngsters. In some cases it's uncertain whether the high lead
levels in some model coolers was from the coolers or water pipes
that feed the coolers.
   In addition to the nine lead-lined coolers from the Navy, the
EPA received two additional coolers with lead-lined tanks from
school officials in Portland, Maine, Cook said.
   The law that was passed last year also requires the EPA to
issued detailed guidelines on how to detect lead contamination in
school water systems and sets a timetable for replacing or fixing
coolers that pose a health hazard because of lead contamination.
   The coolers cited by model number were manufactured by three
companies _ Halsey Taylor, EBCO Manufacturing Co., and Sunroc Corp.
The EPA said two other companies have yet to reply to inquiries on
lead content in their coolers and a third said it produced no
coolers with lead components.

<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a bill to protect
federal whistleblowers who report government waste and fraud,
calling it a ``significant improvement'' over a version vetoed by
President Reagan.
   The bill signed by Bush on Monday gives more job protection to
federal employees who disclose misdeeds and mismanagement in their
agencies.
   ``The true whistleblower is a public servant of the highest
order,'' Bush said at a bill-signing ceremony in the Old Executive
Office Building attended by the measure's congressional sponsors.
   Reagan vetoed a similar measure last fall.
   Stripped from the new version _ which was approved unanimously
in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House _ is a provision
opposed by Reagan that would have permitted the Office of Special
Counsel to go to court on behalf of whistleblowers.
   Reagan protested this would have resulted in federal agencies
fighting court battles against each other.
   The new version ``addresses the chief constitutional concerns
raised by earlier versions of this legislation,'' Bush said. ``The
bill I am signing today is a significant improvement over
legislation enacted by Congress last year.''
   Under the new act, employees fighting for their jobs would face
less stringent standards of proof that their firing or demotion
came as the result of whistleblowing.
   The Office of the Special Counsel, established eight years ago
to investigate civil service abuses, would become an independent
agency.

<HEAD>PLO Rejects Israeli Plan For Elections In Occupied Territories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO has rejected an Israeli proposal
to hold elections among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Wafa, the PLO news agency, said the proposal by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir is ``nothing but a reactivation of the
self-autonomy scheme of the Camp David accord, which the PLO and
our entire Palestinian people already have rejected.''
   George Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, said in a statement issued in Damascus, Syria:
   ``We will not allow the Shamir plan to pass. We will not allow
elections to be held under enemy army bayonets. We will not allow
the creation of a substitute leadership whatever their name or
color might be.''
   Habash's Marxist organization is the second-largest group in the
Palestine Liberation Organization after Yasser Arafat's Fatah, the
main Palestinian fighting force.
   Under Shamir's plan, proposed last week in Washington,
Palestinians would choose representatives for negotiations about an
interim settlement in the territories.
   An Israeli government official in Jerusalem quoted Shamir on
Monday as saying he was willing to discuss participation in
proposed elections by Palestinians from outside the territories.
   The official said those elected also might consult during
negotiations with the PLO, with which Shamir refuses to deal,
because ``no one can think the PLO is an element you can totally
ignore.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the PLO should ``explore practical ways to advance the peace
process.'' He declined to say whether the United States was asking
the PLO to endorse Shamir's plan, which received President Bush's
qualified support.
   The Wafa report, quoting a PLO spokesman it did not identify,
said elections in the occupied lands should be held under
international supervision after Israel withdraws.
   ``The idea of elections is totally unacceptable in the shadow of
Israeli occupation and this proposal is nothing but a maneuver
aimed at undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to
achieve a just settlement in the Middle East,'' the report said.
   In the U.S-mediated Camp David accords that lead to the 1979
peace treaty, Egypt and Israel agreed to limited autonomy for
Palestinians in the territories that Israel captured from Jordan
and Egypt in 1967.
   The PLO spokesman said Israel should turn over the territories
to a U.N. supervisory force for a transition period during which
elections would be held.
   On Friday, PLO chairman Arafat said Shamir's proposal was
``inappropriate, as usual.''
   Monday's PLO statement reiterated calls for an international
peace conference on the Middle East involving all parties
concerned, ``including the Palestinian state'' proclaimed Nov. 15
by the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature.
   It is the first PLO mention of the Palestinian state as the
representative of Palestinians at an international forum. Previous
references have been to the PLO itself.

<HEAD>New Car Average Mileage of 33 mpg Possible by 1995, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cars could average 33 miles per gallon by
1995, but automakers are unlikely to make the necessary engineering
changes on their own, the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment says.
   The higher average, about 5 mpg above the present one for new
cars, could be reached if automakers began immediately to move
available fuel-conservation technology into their cars at a more
rapid pace, an analyst with the office told a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on Monday.
   Those changes include better tires, more aerodynamic body design
and engine improvements, said Steven Plotkin, senior associate with
the office.
   ``We calculate that this level of efficiency could be obtained
without a performance loss or the need to move to smaller vehicles,
at a cost that would be compensated for by fuel savings,'' Plotkin
told the oversight and investigations subcommttee, chaired by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich.
   But the office ``doubts that the industry will pursue this
course without a further economic or regulatory incentive to do
so,'' Plotkin said.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have said high
fuel-economy standards are difficult to reach because of the
public's demand for larger, high-powered cars.
   The OTA analysis struck a middle course between the positions of
advocates of tighter fuel-economy standards and the major U.S.
automakers.
   Energy conservation groups have proposed a 45 mpg fuel-economy
goal for cars by 2000, a level Plotkin said was ``virtually
impossible'' to reach.
   Neither GM nor Ford could provide estimates of attainable fuel
efficiency for 1995.
   ``We haven't gone out that far in our prognostications, largely
because there are just too many variables to deal with, the largest
of which is fuel cost,'' said GM spokesman Gray Terry.
   The office's analysis assumed a $1.10 per gallon price for
gasoline, Plotkin said.
   The corporate average fuel economy standard requires the mix of
1989 cars sold by each automaker to average 26.5 mpg or better. The
average fuel-efficiency for all new passenger cars in the United
States in 1987 was 28 mpg and Plotkin said the present level is
about the same.
   Among the presently available technologies whose adoption could
improve fuel efficiency are more aerodynamic styling, improved tire
composition and design and improved pumps and other components,
Plotkin said.
   Greater use of front-wheel drive, four-speed automatic shift,
four-cylinder and four-valve engines and low-friction rings and
pistons would also help increase the average fuel efficiency of
cars in the United States, Plotkin said.
   The goal likely couldn't be reached if present trends toward
greater performance and luxury continued, or if the industry had to
comply with stricter pollution-control standards that required
technologies that reduce fuel efficiency, Plotkin said.

   People who called an expanded toll-free
telephone service offered by the Social Security Administration met
with busy signals, endless waits on hold and misinformation when
they did get through, witnesses told a Senate panel.
   Judith Price of Akron, Ohio, told the the Senate Special
Committee on Aging that she was put on hold three times for 20
minutes, then told she would have to wait 30 days for the answer to
a question on moving her mother's checks into a new account.
   A phone representative neglected to tell Kathryn Lippert of
Pittsburgh that she needed to file a claim to get a widow's
benefit, and she said it took five months to wade through red tape
before the problem was solved.
   ``I would like to point out that for the past five months, I
have only received my own Social Security check, which is $70 less
than my rent alone,'' she told the panel on Monday.
   The administration began the 800-number service last October,
hoping to improve convenience and accessibility to the public by
making phone representatives available for 12 hours per day,
instead of eight. The system, in which calls to local Social
Security offices are routed to any of 37 national ``teleservice''
centers, has been implemented so far in 60 percent of the nation
and received 22 million calls.
   The service was touted in two mailings to a total of 36 million
beneficiaries in December and February.
   Lawmakers began hearing about the system after national busy
signal rates reached 43 percent in January, followed by 35 percent
in February.
   The rate dipped to 9 percent in March, but only after calls
dropped from 4.8 million in March to 3.4 million in February, and
after SSA brought in staff members in from other offices to answer
calls, a General Accounting Office official testified.
   ``While the reassignment of staff contributed to the reduction
of this busy signal rate for March, it raises questions about the
impact on the operations of the field facilities,'' Joseph Delfico
of GAO's Human Resources Division said in a prepared statement.
   John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, told the panel that SSA Commissioner Dorcas
Hardy ``has created sweatshop conditions for teleservice
employees.''
   ``She is pressuring employees to complete calls in an average of
200 seconds,'' he said, adding that the employees are being denied
sick leave.
   SSA said it reduced the busy signal rate in March partly through
the use of a system to reroute calls during peak calling times.
   ``As we have identified problems and gained experience with the
system, we have been able to modify our procedures along the way in
order to improve our performance,'' Hardy told the panel.
   ``This will be the largest 800-number in the world,'' she said
in a prepared text. ``I want it to be the best.''
   A survey conducted by SSA in February found that 84 percent of
callers interviewed were satisfied with the phone service and 98
percent thought they had been treated courteously, the
administration said.
   Hardy said the latest survey placed the system-wide accuracy
rate at 94 percent.
   But GAO's Delfico said that an SSA study last December found
that the number of incorrect 800-number responses ranged from 2.5
percent for a question on disability benefits to 22.9 percent for a
question on the annual earnings test for people 70 years old and
over.
   The service handled 22 million calls during its first six months.

   It lacked the proper equipment and dawdled
when it should have been racing against the clock, but the
oil-smeared ``response team'' promised to revise its contingency
plan and do better next time.
   The Allyeska-Exxxon Response Team was the last of the 103 teams
to cross the finish line in the 14th-annual Ski-to-Sea Relay near
Juneau.
   ``We were well-prepared. We had a good plan. But, darn, the
thing just wasn't adequate,'' team member Jim Nordlund said Monday.
   Nordlund said his team was neither sanctioned nor supported by
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. nor Exxon Corp., the companies blamed
for the slow response to the Valdez oil spill. It was just
coincidence that team members had crude oil on their faces and
clothes, he said.
   In fact, all but one of the team members work for the
Legislature, which is no stranger to oil companies.
   Each team included a downhill skier, who began the relay at the
top of the Eaglecrest Ski Area and passed the baton to a
cross-country skier, two runners and a bicyclist.
   Nordlund, a legislative aide, noted his bicycle was not designed
for the job.
   ``We thought it was a state-of-the-art bike. It actually was a
little small. It wasn't large enough to deal with the size of the
race,'' he said.
   ``Well, it basically was a little kid's bike.''
   The downhill skier in Nordlund's team missed all the gates,
``and unfortunately there's a penalty each time you do that,'' he
said. ``I think she skied part of the way backwards.''
   Things got worse when the team's cross-country skier took over.
   ``He's our lawyer and he was dressed up in a suit and tie,
smoking a cigar,'' Nordlund recalled. ``After the start he realized
his cigar went out so he stopped and took the time to light it.
   ``He figured there just wasn't much of a hurry. Things were
under control. He had The Wall Street Journal with him and he read
that.''
   Wendie Marriott, who organized the weekend race as the city's
recreation supervisor, said she heard that the team's runners
actually ran _ backward.
   ``The team was purposely trying to come in last, which it did,''
she observed. ``The idea was to clean up the mess at the end of the
race.''
   Nordlund said the team learned a lot from the experience.
   ``We'll do it better next time,'' he said. ``You can trust us.''

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are some of the major
components of the federal effort to curb drugs and drug-related
violence in the District of Columbia proposed by national drug
control policy director William J. Bennett.
   _JAIL AND PRISON SPACE:
   Some 250 inmates now housed at the local jail will be moved to
federal prisons. The administration will find excess federal land
for construction of a 500-bed pretrial detention facility to be
built within one year. The federal Bureau of Prisons will build
within two years a 700-bed correctional institution for the
Washington-Baltimore area.
   _LAW ENFORCEMENT:
   Expansion of the current task force which combines federal,
state and local law enforcement officials to include 57 more people
including 25 FBI agents, 11 Drug Enforcement Administration agents
and five intelligence analysts from the Defense Department.
   In addition, the Pentagon will assign 10 military lawyers to
augment the U.S. attorney's staff and the local National Guard will
help the task force in an as-yet-undetermined way.
   The FBI will provide access to its own information and its
laboratory as well as perform forensic examinations of firearms and
other evidence found during drug-related murder investigations.
   _PUBLIC HOUSING:
   The Housing and Urban Development Department will ease
regulations covering eviction of drug offenders from federally
funded housing projects.
   HUD, with help from the local police, will try to revitalize
local housing projects by such actions as the issuance of photo
identification cards to legitimate tenants, erection of security
fences around projects, establishment of guarded entrances and
refurbishment of projects.
   _TREATMENT PROGRAMS:
   The Health and Human Services Department will authorize the
National Institute of Drug Abuse to establish three model
outpatient clinics that will provide at least 300 new treatment
slots by 1990. In addition, NIDA will provide immediate technical
assistance in the district's current treatment programs.
   _JOBS:
   The Labor Department will expand its local summer training and
education program, work with private employers to recruit more
young people for job-training programs, and grant $100,000 to
establish employee assistance programs for drug abuse in small- and
medium-sized businesses.
   _EDUCATION:
   The Education Department, which by law must increase funds for
drug prevention programs in Washington by 50 percent to $1.4
million, also will expedite applications for additional funds and
programs to help the drug education effort.

<HEAD>Former President Nixon Asks No Reagan-Bashing in Bush White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon didn't like
hearing that former President Reagan was the object of criticism by
some members of George Bush's White House.
   Nixon fired off a letter to Bush's chief of staff John Sununu
saying as much. Sununu issued a decree that any such bad-mouthing
was to cease.
   And the whole matter came to the attention of Bush, who wrote
Nixon a note on the subject, according to Nixon's spokesman.
   Fitzwater said Sununu sounded off during a recent senior staff
meeting, after a Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. story quoted several
current White House officials anonymously as comparing Reagan
unfavorably with Bush.
   The comparisons focused on Bush's active work shedule and
Reagan's reputation for leaving detail to aides and keeping short
hours.
   Fitzwater would not say whether the Nixon complaint caused
Sununu's order that aides refrain from criticizing the former
president.
   He said that Bush and Reagan speak frequently on the phone and
that Bush has the ``highest respect'' for the man who made him vice
president.
   ``Most of us owe our careers'' to the former president, he said,
noting that he and others, including Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, had worked in the Reagan White House.
   John Taylor, a spokesman for Nixon in Saddle River, N.J.,
confirmed that Nixon had written Sununu complaining about the
story. ``As a matter of fact, President Bush dropped President
Nixon a note last week,'' Taylor said.
   In a March 23 story, Knight-Ridder White House correspondent
Owen Ullmann quoted several top-level aides to Bush, including some
who had worked for Reagan, as saying such things as that Reagan
would still have been asleep at 7 a.m. _ the hour Bush usually
arrives at the Oval Office.
   Fitzwater dressed down Ullmann during Monday's White House news
briefing, accusing the reporter of making up quotes. Later in the
morning, Fitzwater apologized for the personal attack on Ullmann,
but didn't discuss any further the merits of the story.
   At the briefing, Fitzwater said that ``I don't know anybody who
has been bad-mouthing former President Reagan.''
   Fitzwater said that Sununu told staff aides, ``Don't get caught,
you know, making jokes or being lighthearted or anything about the
past.'' He quoted Sununu as saying, ``I don't know whether this is
true or not, but if it is, don't let it happen.''

<HEAD>Audit: Military Stuck with Millions Worth of Useless Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military has a multimillion-dollar
stockpile of useless spare parts because contractors fail to follow
specifications and the government neglects to check the shipments,
a Defense Department auditor told Congress.
   A two-year audit conducted at the Warner Robins Air Logistics
Center in Georgia concluded an estimated $104 million worth of
parts failed to conform ``to essential or critical operational
characteristics,'' according to a report released Monday to the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   The report detailed problems both with the way government
contractors ship out parts and the way the military accepts and
pays for parts without making sure they meet rigidly drawn
specifications.
   ``Obviously we have a lot of material out there that is not
combat-ready,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, told a hearing of the
committee, which he chairs. ``I want to know why we are accepting
substandard parts.''
   Maj. Gen. Richard Smith of the Air Force Logistics Command told
Glenn he would order spot inspections of parts as they're delivered.
   And Brig. Gen. M.J. Pepe of the U.S. Army Defense Logistics
Agency told Glenn the Army has started to equip its depots with
equipment to test parts as they come in.
   ``It's obvious we need to do more checking,'' Pepe said. ``We
hadn't been doing enough checking.''
   In addition, since July 1988 competitive contracts have included
a one-year warranty requiring replacement or refund of substandard
parts, Smith said.
   Derek Vander Schaaf, deputy inspector general for the Defense
Department, said the audit covered spare parts chosen randomly from
the Warner Robins warehouse.
   About 58 percent, or $12.9 millon worth, of the gun parts tested
in the study were unusable. Only 8 percent of examined gun parts,
with such functions as feeding ammunition into 20mm and 30mm
aircraft-mounted guns, conformed to specifications, the audit
report said.
   Tests of mounted bearings, which are used in aircraft landing
gears and wing flaps and on helicopter main rotor heads, indicated
38 percent conformed to specifications and 30 percent were unusable.
   Below-standard parts routinely were accepted and used, though
the failure to conform to specifications meant they didn't last as
long as they would have if they met the standards, the report said.
   Vander Schaaf said auditors found numerous examples of
contractors who shipped defective parts to one branch of the
service, but other branches weren't told of the problems and gave
the same contractor orders for identical or similar parts.
   In one case, ``one part of the Air Logistics Center gave new
work to a contractor while another part of the same Logistics
Center hauled $1.5 million worth of the same contractor's parts to
the scrap yard,'' Vander Schaaf testified.

<HEAD>Beetle Bellies May Hold Key to Safer Food Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A natural yeast found in a beetle's stomach
can neutralize deadly farm chemicals and natural toxins that
sometimes are found in the nation's food supply, according two
government scientists.
   Entomologists Patrick F. Dowd and Samuel K. Shen of the
Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service said that if
preliminary tests are borne out in further experiments, the yeast
could be used to remove potentially harmful toxins from livestock
feed and to clean up the environment.
   ``Although we're not yet sure of its full range of detoxifying
ability, the implication we see here is for the environmental
cleanup situations, like toxic waste dumps,'' Shen said.
   If the yeast can be developed properly, it could be
mass-produced to detoxify a wide variety of plant and chemical
toxins in the environment, he said in a report issued by the USDA
agency.

<NOTE>Coast Guard to Ease Seizure Rules in Drug Cases</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard is making permanent its
decision not to seize vessels when only small quantities of drugs
are found on board.
   The agency announced Monday a rulemaking that would subject the
owners of commercial fishing vessels to a summons in cases when
personal-use quantities of illegal drugs are found on their ships.
   The issuing of summonses in such cases was instituted on an
interim basis Feb. 16 and the rulemaking would make that permanent,
the Coast Guard said.
   Before that, vessels had been subject to immediate seizure when
any quantity of drugs was found.
   The new regulation covers commercial fishing, fish processing
and fish tender vessels.
   Separate laws extend similar protection to ferry boats, cruise
ships and other commercial vessels in cases in which a passenger
brings small quantities of drugs on board. However, these vessels
remain subject to seizure if there is evidence that the master or
operator of the vessel was aware of the violation.

   The Pentagon is sending investigators to Hanoi
this week for 2{ weeks to search for U.S. servicemen missing from
the Vietnam war.
   In addition, the Vietnamese government has informed the United
States it intends ``to repatriate 21 remains, which may be those of
Americans, on April 27,'' the Pentagon said in a statement on
Monday.
   The investigative teams will arrive in Hanoi on Wednesday for
what will be the fifth such joint mission working with Vietnamese
officials in the field.
   The three teams _ two comprised of investigators and one
consisting of forensic scientists _ have been told they can remain
in the country until April 30, making this the longest such mission
ever, the Pentagon added.
   Previous U.S.-Vietnamese field missions were limited to 10 days
each.
   The teams concentrate their efforts primarily on investigating
geographic areas near the last known position of so-called
``discrepancy'' cases. A discrepancy case is one in which the U.S.
government has reason to believe an American serviceman survived an
airplane crash or hostile fire.
   The joint teams also attempt to investigate live-sighting
reports and other claims about the fate of missing servicemen.

   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield went to court to
stop a hotel chain from using his voice in its commercials because
he ``can't get no respect'' elsewhere.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian scheduled a pretrial
hearing Sept. 11 and trial Oct. 17 unless Dangerfield and Park Inns
Inc. of Dallas can settle their differences. Dangerfield alleges an
impersonator illegally mimicked his voice on a radio commercial.
   ``The case poses the question of whether someone can do a satire
of a famous person and get the benefit of something someone has
spent their whole life developing,'' said John Lavely, the
entertainer's lawyer.
   Dangerfield, he said, has spent a lifetime developing a unique
voice, style and remarks such as, ``I can't get no respect.''
   Attorneys for Park Inns argue they have the right to satirize
famous people. They also said the commercial, which has been
discontinued, contained a disclaimer that celebrity voices were
impersonated.
   Dangerfield was not in court Monday, but his complaint said the
disclaimer was insufficient.

   At a news conference, a smiling Jessica, now 3, played with a

   Former Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton
was negligent when he accidentally shot the manager of his
restaurant last year with a semi-automatic gun, a lawsuit alleges.
   The 28-year-old plaintiff, Elmer Ray Huston, was shot in the
knee and has undergone two knee operations because of the April 13,
1988, shooting, according to his lawsuit filed Monday. The Cook
County Circuit Court lawsuit seeks in excess of $15,000.
   ``He was sitting there twirling a gun talking to the man and the
gun went off,'' said Philip Corboy, Hutson's attorney. ``He
certainly didn't intend to do it.''
   Corboy said the shooting was ``negligent and it's careless ...
like a doctor leaving a sponge in your belly.''
   Telephone calls Monday to Payton's home and the office of his
attorney, Paul Holmes, went unanswered.
   No criminal charges were filed in connection with the shooting

   Morton Downey Jr.'s television act may be
all finger-pointing and shouting, but his behavior off the show is
a shock: He's polite.
   Showing little of the swagger that characterizes his syndicated
talk show, Downey dueled a former lawyer for the Federal
Communications Commission on Monday on government regulation of
broadcasting.
   The conclusion? Civilized minds may differ.
   ``I might like filet mignon and you might like a hot dog,''
Downey said at a forum celebrating the bicentennial of the U.S.
Constitution. ``No one can dictate good taste.''
   The conservative television host said he found it amusing to be
taking a more liberal viewpoint than his counterpart, lawyer Bruce
Fein. Fein argued that government should take a more active role in
making sure television doesn't descend into bad taste.
   Downey said it's dangerous for the government to decide what
people should or shouldn't listen to.
   Despite their disagreements, the two were quite civil during the
45-minute discussion. Fein was even kind about Downey's show.
   ``There's nothing indecent or obscene about being provocative,
being colorful, or even about name-calling,'' he said.

   Oregon has a state fish, rock, dance and
flower. And the Senate has now voted for a state nut.
   The chamber voted 21-1 Monday to give the designation to the
hazelnut, better known in the state as the filbert.
   Oregon produces 98 percent of the U.S. hazelnut crop, and
industry representatives say the state's dominance in hazelnuts
needs more recognition. The measure now goes to the House.
   Karen Lobb of the Oregon Hazelnut Commission said Oregon growers
produced 16,300 tons of hazelnuts worth around $20 million in 1988.
   Oregon processors press the nuts for oil, grind them for paste
and butter, and use them in a candies.
   It's not the first time the state has taken hazelnuts seriously.
In 1951, for instance, it formed the state hazelnut commission.

   Southern rockers Alabama got the artist
of the decade award from the Academy of Country Music, but it was
1989's top entertainer Hank Williams Jr. who provided the show's
wallop.
   Williams was one of three double winners, taking his third
consecutive entertainer of the year trophy and second video award
during Monday night's 24th-annual presentations.
   K.T. Oslin won album of the year and best female vocalist and
Kathy Mattea's ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' won for record
and song.
   Randy Travis was shut out despite three nominations.
   It appeared to be Alabama's night as the band joined Marty
Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the artist of the decade ranks.
   But Williams, the wild-eyed Tennessean whose rowdiness has been
embraced by country music in recent years, brought a tear to many
of the 1,600 people present when he accepted his trophy.
   ``I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender,''
Williams said. ``I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all
of you in this room and all the fans out there.''
   Williams then referred to his current hit record and video, the
father-son duet ``Tear in My Beer,'' which uses a tape his late
father made decades ago.
   ``The video with Daddy was the most special thing I ever did in
my life,'' Williams said, choking back tears and biting his lip.
   Backstage, he conceded it was as emotional for him as the
audience.
   ``When I started talking about that video I had to get off that
stage because the man of steel just about lost it,'' he said.
   The presentations broadcast on NBC-TV also brought a videotaped
salute from President Bush, who said ``howdy'' and told the artists
he had a ``deep appreciation for country and western music, and the
values you represent.''
   The big surprise was Travis' leaving empty handed. He's won
eight ACM trophies since 1986 and this year has won American Music
Awards and a Grammy Award.
   The crowd inside Walt Disney Studios gave a standing ovation to
Alabama members Randy Owen, Jeff Cook, Teddy Gentry and Mark
Herndon.
   ``I'd like to accept this award for all those artists that have
deserved awards but never won awards,'' said Owen.
   Alabama has won 13 Country Music Awards since 1982. It has had
21 consecutive No. 1 singles, including ``Feels So Right,'' ``The
Closer You Get,'' ``Roll On'' and ``You've Got the Touch.''
   Cowpoke balladeer Robbins prevailed in the 1960s and coal
miner's daughter Miss Lynn was crowned the decade's best in the
1970s.
   Miss Oslin, the robust queen of down-home music known for her
irreverence, thanked ``the fans, the radio that played me and me.''
   Strait won his third male vocalist trophy, the last time in 1986
when he also won album of the year.
   ``This means a lot to me. My little boy has been asking me,
`Dad, when are you going to win another award?' Well, we got one
tonight Bubba,'' Strait said, referring to 7-year-old George Jr.
   Los Angeles-based Highway 101 beat out Alabama, the Desert Rose
Band, the Oak Ridge Boys and Restless Heart to take their second
consecutive vocal group trophy.
   The Judds, Naomi and her daughter Wynona, took their fifth
consecutive duet award.
   Suzy Bogguss was named top new female vocalist and Rodney
Crowell, whose wife is country singer Rosanne Cash, was named the
top new male vocalist.
   Buck Owens, the academy's top male vocalist in 1966, was
presented the non-competitive Pioneer Award for outstanding
achievement.
   In awards announced earlier, the Desert Rose Band won the
academy's top touring band trophy.
   Winners in the instrumental categories were Curtis Stone, bass;
Steve Duncan, drums; Mark O'Connor, fiddle; Al Bruno, guitar; John
Hobbs, keyboard; Charlie McCoy, specialty instrument (harmonica);
Jay Dee Maness, steel guitar; and Nashville Now, non-touring band.
   Nashville radio station WSIX was voted the nation's best in
country music and southern California's Crazy Horse Steak House &amp;
Saloon was named top nightclub.
   There was a tie for disc jockey of the year between Jon Conlon
of WGKX in Memphis, Tenn., and Dandalion of WRKZ in Hershey, Pa.
Dandalion is the first woman to win the honor.
   The winners were decided in a vote by the 2,000-member academy.

   A fire at a chemical plant sent smoke
billowing over a community east of here on Monday night, prompting
most of the town's evacuation, authorities said.
   There were unconfirmed reports that up to 35 people, including
one firefighter, suffered ill effects from the smoke, said Ventura
County sheriff's Sgt. Gary Backman.
   ``The deputies out there tell me you don't have to be out there
too long before you feel the pressure in your chest,'' he said.
   About 200 residents of Saticoy were evacuated from the northeast
portion of the unincorporated town a few hours after the blaze
began, but that was later expanded to include most of the town,
Backman said.
   The blaze erupted around 6 p.m. in a small chemical plant called
Pacific Intermediaries and continued burning five hours later.
   It was not immediately known what chemical was involved.
   ``It's a hazardous material that's water-reactant, which means
they can't use water to put it out, but they're about to dump about
50 tons of sand on it,'' a California Highway Patrol dispatcher
said late Monday night.
   A half-mile section of busy Highway 118 was shut down as a
precaution because of the smoke, and was expected to remain closed
through the night, the dispatcher said.
   Ventura is 75 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

   The dollar marginally rose against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices sharply rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 132.62 yen, down 0.09 yen from Monday's
close of 132.53 yen. The currency opened at 132.87 yen and
fluctuated within a range of 132.60-132.89 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
186.03 points Monday, recouped 250.56 points, or 0.76 percent, to
finish trading at 33,249.58.
   Dealers said the index started lower amid political
uncertainties prior to parliamentary testimony by Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita Tuesday morning about receiving political
donations from the firm at the center of a major stock-profiteering
and bribery scandal.
   Takeshita said he had received about $1 million from the firm.
He denied taking bribes and continued to fend off opposition calls
for his resignation.
   Investors were reassured as Takeshita said nothing new, a dealer
at a major securities firm said on condition of anonymity.
   Opposition parties have stalemated parliamentary proceedings,
demanding a full accounting of governing Liberal Democratic Party
politicians' involvement in the scandal surrounding information
services conglomerate Recruit Co.
   On the foreign exchange, participants mainly adjusted their
dollar positions due to a lack of market-affecting incentives, said
a trader at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Currency traders reacted to Takeshita's statements by buying
yen, pushing the dollar slightly lower, he said.
   ``The yen edged up as some investors got relieved and bought the
currency because Takeshita didn't say anything shocking before the
Parliament this morning,'' he said.

   The $7.1 million holdup of a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford,
Conn., was one of the largest cash heists in U.S. history,
prosecutors said.
   On April 29, 1985, gunmen stole $7.9 million in cash from a
Wells Fargo depot in New York City.
   On Dec. 12, 1982, two men broke into the Sentry Armored Car
Courier Co. office in New York City. About $11 million disappeared,
but authorities say only a fraction of that amount may have been
taken by the robbers. Only about $1 million has been recovered, and
investigators say some of the missing money may have been
previously embezzled.

   Takeshita's statement was a reversal of earlier comments that he

   ``I am feeling my political and moral responsibilities very
strongly,'' he told parliament's budget committee. ``I think it is

   Eastern Airlines' striking unions agreed to big

   Involved are changes in Ueberroth's $464 million takeover deal

must accept those changes if the deal is to go forward, say sources
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The unions demanded that the bankruptcy court appoint a special

assure that Lorenzo won't play a role in Eastern's reorganization,
The Times said.

   The government has won convictions of

the island gain independence.
   The four have maintained that the trial stemming from one of the
country's biggest cash heists was politically motivated. They and
their lawyers vowed to appeal Monday's verdicts.
   Carlos Ayes Suarez, who was acquitted, said prosecutors had
sought to ``criminalize the pro-independence movement in our

<TEXT>
   Two Haitian soldiers who fired their way aboard a
small plane before hijacking it to Florida were being questioned
about their role in a recent failed coup attempt in Haiti,
authorities and witnesses said.
   The plane was carrying eight people, including three American
missionaries, when the Fort Lauderdale-bound flight was hijacked
Monday. No one was injured.
   Passengers said the soldiers did not threaten them and had hoped
to talk to President Bush.
   The two were to be arraigned this afternoon on air piracy
charges charges, said Paul Miller, an FBI spokesman.
   Witnesses said the pair ran out waving guns and shooting in the
air Monday on the tarmac at Cap Haitien airport on Haiti's northern
coast, and forced their way onto the twin-engine Cessna 402.
   They threw down their weapons and surrendered upon arrival at
Miami International Airport, the FBI said.
   ``These guys were pretty upset,'' said pilot Duer Smedley.
``They were desperate to get out of Haiti. They're not like
terrorists from Lebanon. They are not looking to hurt anyone. They
are just looking for a way out of the country.''
   Guillaume Berlioze, 25, and Fadael Milord, 29, both of the
Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, were armed with a .38-caliber
revolver, an assault rifle and a 40mm anti-tank shell, the FBI said.
   They were questioned by the FBI and transferred to the
Metropolitian Correctional Center.
   Miller said investigators weren't certain of the motive behind
the hijacking, but, ``there are indications that they are against
the government.'' Police sources at Cap Haitien, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the hijackers had deserted from the
Dessalines Battalion.
   The battalion, with 750 soldiers, is one of two military units
that tried to bring down Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's military
president, on April 2.
   By Monday, Avril's loyal 1,100-member Presidential Guard
appeared to have quieted rebellious outbreaks.
   Smedley said the pair told him they wanted to talk to Bush after
they surrendered.
   ``I asked him where he wanted to go and he said `Miami, Miami, I
have a lot of things to tell Bush,''' the pilot said.
   ``The military has been fighting down there for the last week,''
Smedley said. ``I think these guys were just on the losing side. I
got the impression that they thought if they stayed in Haiti, they
would be killed.''
   Passenger Larry Keyser, a missionary from South Barrington,
Ill., said the hijack was frightening at first.
   ``They scared us,'' Keyser said. ``But they were basically
harmless. They actually expected President Bush to be waiting for
them outside the plane.''
   ``They were more scared then we were,'' said another missionary,
Cindy Kato of Tallahassee.
   Kato, Keyser and the other missionary aboard, Rob Wilkins, also
of South Barrington, are members of the Missionary Aviation
Fellowship of Redlands, Calif.
   Four Haitians also were on the flight, said fellowship
spokeswoman Donna Burns.
   The Christian fellowship was founded in 1945 and operates 145
aircraft, primarily to fly doctors, medical supplies and
missionaries to Third World countries.
   In October 1987, a fellowship single-engine plane was hijacked
in Suriname. The pilot was held by a rebel guerrilla group before
being released unharmed.

<HEAD>Lebanon Hostage Came Within Minutes Of Being Released, Sister Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teacher Brian Keenan, who marked his third
anniversary as a hostage in Lebanon today, came within 10 minutes
of being released in January before something mysteriously went
wrong, said his sister, Elaine Spence.
   ``Our hopes were highest in January and we now know that Brian
was 10 minutes away from being released,'' Mrs. Spence said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   ``He was clean shaven. He had fresh clothes. His hair was cut
and he was ready for release.''
   Mrs. Spence said that she and her sister Brenda Gillham were
wating patiently at a hotel in Dublin with a plane standing by to
fly them to Syria as soon as they received word their brother was
free.
   ``Then suddenly, within a split second, our hopes died,'' she
said. ``We don't know what went wrong and we still don't know what
happened.''
   Mrs. Spence did not indicate the source of the family's
information.
   Keenan, 38, disappeared while walking to work at the American
University of Beirut on April 11, 1986. No one has claimed
responsibility for holding him.
   The Belfast man has dual British and Irish citizenship.
   Mrs. Spence also said she was bitter that the controversy over
author Salman Rushdie may have hampered efforts to release her
brother.
   Britain and Iran broke diplomatic ties in February after Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for the murder of
Rushdie, a British citizen, for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
Many Moslems consider the book blasphemous.
   ``With the like of the Salman Rushdie case, yes, I did get very
bitter with him,'' Mrs. Spence said. ``Salman Rushdie was a Moslem,
a person of the Moslem faith. There was my brother. His life was
held against Salman Rushdie's.''
   Mrs. Gillham said: ``It has been a very, very hard three years.
We have had no life whatsoever because our whole life revolves
around Brian. We keep thinking of him, even in our sleep.
   ``We dream about Brian, about the people holding him, what they
are fighting about and hope someday he'll come back to us.''
   Keenan is one of 15 foreigners, nine of them Americans, missing
in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.
   On Monday, Jill Morrell, girlfriend of missing British
journalist John McCarthy, met Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe,
but said she was ``disappointed'' in the government's strategy to
secure the hostages' release.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Ancient City In Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of an
ancient Mesopotamian city that flourished 4,000 years ago and
rivaled Babylon.
   The site of Mashkan-shapir, 90 miles south of the Iraqi capital
Baghdad, has not been occupied since the city was sacked and burned
about 1720 B.C.
   The city was identified during the first six weeks of
preliminary surveys earlier this year after Elizabeth C. Stone, one
of the archaeologists, discovered a cuneiform inscription on a clay
fragment with the name Mashkan.
   ``We have a whole city plan laid out there for us,'' said Stone,
who, with her husband, Paul Zimansky, identified the site in
January.
   ``We know where the canals were, the cemetery, the palace and
religious quarters, the manufacturing area and the city wall. A
complete, undisturbed city _ that's what's really exciting about it
as an archaeological site,'' Stone said in an interview in The New
York Times today.
   Stone, an associate professor of archaeology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and Zimansky, an assistant
professor of archaeology at Boston University, said the city may
rank among the region's major archaeological finds of the past four
decades.
   Other scholars cheered the news of the discovery.
   ``It's always a happy day in archaeology when somewone nails
down the identity of an ancient city,'' said William Hallow,
professor of Assyriology at Yale University.
   Some said the find could be as significant as the 1985 discovery
of Tell Leilan, a northern Mesopotamian center that had been the
seat of a power king in the 18th century B.C. Other archaeologists
doubted that Mashkan-shapir would yield as much as Ebla, an ancient
city in Syria where voluminous archives were discovered in the
1970s and revealed a previously unknown language.
   Stone and Zimansky began exploring the site two years ago,
collecting artifacts on the surface and examining satellite images
of the routes of ancient canals that served the city.
   But they were barred from using aircraft to photograph the site
by Iraqi military restrictions. So Zimansky attached a camera to a
kite to obtain pictures revealing features that were not
immediately visible from the ground.
   The city survived for 300 years as a major trading and
manufacturing center with a population of 15,000. Evidence
indicated that it had been built in honor of Nergal, the ancient
Babylonian god of death, pestilence and other disasters.
   Stone and Zimansky plan more detailed mapping and excavation at
the site next year.

<TEXT>
   Americans say newspapers should extend courtesy
titles to men and women alike, using ``Mr.,'' ``Mrs.,'' ``Miss'' or
``Ms.'' on second reference, a Media General-Associated Press poll
has found.
   Sixty-one percent in the national survey said men identified in
news stories should receive the title ``Mr.'' on second reference,
while 23 percent said the last name should suffice. The rest had no
opinion.
   Similarly, 66 percent wanted a title used in second references
to women. Twenty percent favored just the last name and the rest
had no opinion.
   Among those who wanted courtesy titles for women, 63 percent
said the choice of a title should depend on the woman's preference.
Twenty-three percent favored using only ``Mrs.'' or ``Miss,'' and
13 percent wanted ``Ms.'' used exclusively.
   Of the whole survey, a 42 percent plurality favored giving women
their preference of titles; 20 percent favored no titles for women;
15 percent favored using only ``Mrs.'' and ``Miss;'' another 15
percent had no opinion; and 9 percent wanted ``Ms.'' used only. The
numbers are rounded.
   The survey was conducted March 6-15 among 1,108 randomly
selected adults, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
   All identified subgroups gave majority support for using titles
for men and women and plurality support for giving women their
choice of titles. More young adults and blacks favored titles;
better-educated and wealthier respondents were more apt to oppose
them.
   There was little division between responses of women and men.
Women were slightly more likely to favor titles for men _ 64
percent compared with 57 percent _ and two-thirds of each group
supported titles for women.
   The choice of ``Mrs.'' or ``Miss'' only for women was more
popular with older Americans; 34 percent of respondents over age 64
favored it, compared with only 14 percent of those younger than age
30. Conversely, 16 percent of the younger group favored ``Ms.,''
but just 7 percent of the oldest group agreed.
   Younger respondents were more apt than the oldest group to favor
giving women their choice of titles, 69-57 percent, and more blacks
than whites favored giving the subject her choice, 71-62 percent.
   More of the most-educated respondents, those who had done
postgraduate work, opposed titles for either sex. A third of that
group wanted no title used on second-reference to women, for
example; only 8 percent of those who had not completed high school
agreed. The more-educated group also was more inclined to support
giving women their choice of titles.
   Respondents who said they read a newspaper daily _ nearly
two-thirds of the total _ were a little more likely than
less-frequent readers to support giving women their preference of
titles, 66-58 percent.
   Older, wealthier and better-educated respondents were more
likely to read a newspaper every day, as were Northeasterners.
Liberals and women were a bit less likely to read the news daily.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews March 6-15 with 1,108 adults in the
continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random
phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20.
   The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points, for
example, for the group that favors courtesy titles for women.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. After a newspaper article has given a man's name _ say, John
Smith _ should it then refer to him as ``Smith'' or with the title
``Mr.'' Smith? Smith: 23 percent. Mr.: 61 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 16 percent.
   2. After a newspaper article has given a woman's name _ say,
Jane Doe _ should it then refer to her as ``Doe'' or with a title
such as ``Mrs.,'' ``Miss'' or ``Ms.'' Doe? Doe: 20. With title: 66.
DK-NA: 15.
   3. (If with title) Would you prefer the title be ``Mrs.'' if
she's married and ``Miss'' if she's not married, or should it be
``Ms.'' in all cases, or should it depend on her preference?
Mrs.-Miss: 23. Ms.: 13. Preference: 63. DK-NA: 1.
   4. How often do you read a newspaper _ every day, every few
days, at least once a week, or less than once a week? Every day:
64. Few days: 21. Once a week: 11. Less: 4.

   A strong earthquake shook the sparsely populated

   The earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was

southern tip of the peninsula, according to the Pacific Tsumani
Warning Center in Hawaii.
   It occurred at 7:58 a.m. Moscow time and registered between 7-8
points on the 12-point Soviet scale, said Yulia Krasnopeeva, an
official at the Soviet Seismological Center in Moscow.
   That classified it as a ``very strong'' or ``destructive'' on
the Soviet scale, which is based on visible physical effects.
   Ms. Krasnopeeva said the quake registered 4 on the Soviet scale
in the city of Petropavlovsk about 310 miles to the north on the
Kamchatka Peninsula.
   ``There were no injuries or damage,'' the official Tass news
agency said in a brief report.
   There was no threat of a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami, or
tidal wave, the warning center said.
   The Kamchatka Peninsula extends about 750 miles south from the
Soviet mainland and divides the Bering Sea from the Sea of Okhotsk.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of registering 6 on the scale can cause
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread damage.

<HEAD>Gun Amendment Stirs Up Fuss In Nebraska; High Court Steps In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a state where two of the Wild West's
sharpest shooters left their marks, judges can't decide whether a
voter-approved constitutional amendment means that anyone can carry
a gun.
   The Nebraska Supreme Court has been asked to step in and settle
the dispute.
   Some judges in the western part of the state, where Buffalo Bill
Cody had a ranch, say the statutes limiting possession of firearms
are now unconstitutional because of Initiative 403, which was
approved by voters last fall.
   Some judges in the eastern part of the state, the site of Wild
Bill Hickok's first killing, have read the new constitutional
language to allow for reasonable state regulation of guns.
   And attorneys for one man on death row have argued in federal
court that the language of the amendment also outlawed the death
penalty.
   In coming weeks, the high court will hear oral arguments in two
cases that were dismissed by Lincoln County District Court judges
because of the constitutional amendment. One is against a felon
accused of possessing a firearm; the other involves a man accused
of having a firearm on which the serial number had been defaced.
   J.W. Carlson of Crofton, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association and a backer of the initiative petition that put the
amendment before voters, said the amendment was intended only to
protect the lawful possession of guns.
   In briefs filed Monday, Lincoln County Attorney Kent Turnbull
said District Judges John P. Murphy and Donald E. Rowlands II erred
in tossing out the separate gun cases.
   The judges ruled that the amendment invalidated existing
statutes regulating guns.
   But judges in Douglas County, which includes Omaha, have said
the new language should be read to coexist with the regulatory
statutes.
   Turnbull said in his brief that the intent of the amendment
``was to protect only lawful possession of firearms. Lawful
possession of firearms is that which was lawful when the measure
was adopted. The state may regulate the right to bear arms as a
reasonable exercise of the state's police power.''
   Turnbull argued that prohibiting possession of a defaced
firearm, and prohibiting a felon from possessing a firearm, ``bears
a reasonable relationship to promoting the public safety and is
therefore a lawful exercise of the state's police power.''
   Before Initiative 403 was adopted the state Constitution said:
   ``All persons are by nature free and independent, and have
certain inherent and inalienable rights; among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
   The amendment added a section so that the second part of the
passage now reads: ``...among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness and the right to keep and bear arms for
security or defense of self, family, home and others, and for
lawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all other
lawful purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringed
by the state or any subdivision thereof.''
   Attorneys for convicted contract killer C. Michael Anderson said
they believe the language of the amendment repeals the death
penalty because it cites life as an inalienable right.
   They have filed a lawsuit in Lancaster County District Court
asking that Anderson's death sentence be set aside.

<HEAD>Twenty-Two Die In Crash Of Chartered Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALENCE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators dug through the wreckage of
a twin-engine Fokker 27 aircraft today hoping to find the flight
recorders that might shed light on why the plane crashed, killing
all 22 people aboard.
   There was no immediate explanation for what caused the plane to
smash into a 300-foot cliff in the wooded, mountainous area 15
miles east of Valence at about 9:10 p.m. Monday.
   Within a few hours of the crash, rescue workers had recovered
the bodies of the 19 passengers and three crew members aboard the
Uni-Air plane, chartered by Europe Aero Service, en route to
Valence from Paris.
   The plane broke apart from the impact, spreading wreckage over
several hundred yards, police in Valence said. They said victims'
bodies were taken to a nearby chapel for identification.
   Valence is located on the Rhone River, 41 miles south of Lyon.
   Investigators searched this morning for the flight data recorder
and cockpit voice recorder that might reveal what happened in the
final moments of the flight.
   Air controllers at the regional center near Lyon said the pilot
reported a routine approach to the airport and no particular
problems during his last contact, about eight minutes before the
aircraft's scheduled arrival.
   They said the plane was flying at an altitude of about 3,000
feet when it disappeared from radar.
   There was a light fog, a ceiling of about 5,000 feet and fair
visibility at the time of the crash.
   ``The plane passed about a dozen meters above my house and right
away I knew that it would not clear the cliff,'' said a resident of
the village of Barbiere adjacent to the crash site.
   ``Then I heard a terrifying explosion and I called the fire
department,'' said the man, who declined to provide his name.
   On March 4, 1988, another twin-engine Fokker 27 en route from
Nancy to Paris crashed in the countryside, killing 23 people. The
final report from that investigation provided no reason for the
crash.

<TEXT>
   The man described by prosecutors as one of
the nation's most powerful crime bosses pleaded guilty for the
first time and cried before a federal judge as he admitted to
extortion and racketeering.
   Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno, the 78-year-old reputed former
boss of the Genovese crime family, told the judge Monday he was
guilty of trying to wrest control of a Morris County sand-pit
business and trying to extort $500,000 from its owner, Andrew
Giordano.
   Salerno already is serving a 100-year sentence for his 1986
conviction as a mob boss in the New York trial of the Mafia's
ruling ``Commission.''
   Salerno could be sentenced to an additional five years in prison
and fined up to $10,000 in the New Jersey case.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the New Jersey charges
were warranted despite Salerno's long prison sentence.
   ``The purpose of this indictment was not to increase his
sentence, but to demonstrate to the citizens of New Jersey the
dangers posed by La Cosa Nostra, and the degree to which the
highest levels of the Mafia have infiltrated and affected their
lives,'' Alito said.
   Salerno's attorney, John Jacobs, said the guilty pleas did not
mean Salerno participated in the offenses.
   ``It was an accommodation to avoid trial,'' said Jacobs, who
pointed out that a medical condition caused by a 1981 stroke
affects Salerno's emotional state and caused him to cry at Monday's
hearing.
   Special U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Bronster said the reputed crime
boss's plea shows he was involved in the allegations.
   ``He has pleaded guilty to the charges, I'd say that's admitting
his guilt,'' Bronster said.
   The gravelly voiced Salerno walked into the courtroom with the
aid of a cane.
   He repeatedly answered ``Yes'' when Judge John W. Bissell asked
him if he understood the charges and wished to plead guilty. He
cupped his hands over his face and cried several times.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Motorists Who Kill Deer Can Keep Meat, State Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists who kill deer along
Massachusetts' roads may keep the meat or donate it to their
favorite charity under new state wildlife regulations.
   ``It seems a shame to see it just wasted,'' Steve Williams, a
wildlife biologist in charge of the state's deer management
program, said Monday before the state Division of Wildlife and
Fisheries board approved the change.
   ``A deer can do thousands of dollars of damage to a car and the
meat can provide some compensation,'' he said.
   Williams said that 600 to 700 deer are reported killed on the
state's highways annually, but officials suspect the toll is three
times higher.
   ``Some go off into the woods to die and some just end up in the
trunk of the car,'' said Walter Bickford, commissioner of fisheries
and wildlife.
   Under the new rule, the driver or a passenger could keep the
venison only if they are residents of Massachusetts.
   ``We don't want to get involved in transporting road kills
across state lines,'' said Ellie Horowitz, a spokeswoman for the
division.
   The change was sparked in part by the state Environmental
Police's decision in October to stop picking up animal carcasses,
leaving the problem to municipalities. Bickford said budget cuts
forced police to stop the service.

   Earl Peterson is just one of many worried
fishermen in the Kodiak Cafe, a popular coffee shop on the
waterfront of the nation's richest fishing port.
   Just off Kodiak's coast is a gloppy mess that could end a way of
life in Kodiak, which last year handled fish harvests worth more
than $166 million. The black ooze that smothered much of Prince
William Sound headed this way.
   And the fishermen here are not happy with Exxon's response to
the spill that left them with a 10-million-gallon nightmare.
   They are holding their breath as tentacles of oil reach into
fertile cod and halibut fishing grounds nearby.
   ``Hellfire, man, what did they do? They didn't have any
equipment to do anything with anyway. This ought to wake somebody
up,'' Peterson said as he puffed his cigarette down to the filter.
   ``They have to pass some laws to have certain things and have
somebody to ride herd on them.''
   Peterson, his face weather-lined and his hands dark and
work-hardened, has depended on the sea for a living for 20 years.
In his 52-foot boat, the Markayla Dawn, he harvests crab, salmon
and halibut.
   ``Yeah, I worry about the long-term effects. We all do. I wonder
what will happen.''
   Another one worrying is Jack Hill, part-owner of two vessels now
at sea fishing for black cod. ``It's just a tragedy,'' he said. ``A
lot of the oil is on the halibut grounds and on the black cod
grounds.
   ``Our problem is we have a big halibut season in a month. It's a
24-hour opening. If we lay the gear and have to pull it six, eight
or 10 hours later because of oil, it will cost.
   ``And if we have one fish that's tainted ... you can't have one
bad fish in your load,'' said Hill, who has been a commercial
fisherman 26 years.
   ``Everybody is worried what the long-term effect is. Depending
on the long-term effects, it can mean your way of life is gone as a
fisherman.
   ``It could be bad. It really could. Then, it might not be. It
could affect everybody here. This is a fishing village and
everything is tied to that.''
   Bill Eoff said he thinks cleanup officials should attack the oil
before its coats Kodiak's rocky coastline.
   ``I feel they better do everything they can, including hiring
local boats and people, and get them out there.''
   But he said that may not be enough.
   ``In the long term, who knows? It could be years, and years and
years and years of dead areas.''

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners today shelled a Christian
army position outside Beirut and tension rose about a possible
violent Moslem response to the expected arrival of two French ships
with humanitarian aid.
   Police said no casualties were reported from the brief Syrian
howitzer barrage against the deserted town of Souk el-Gharb, about
15 miles southeast of Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said ``there was no response from the Christian side to the
barrage.''
   Shells fired by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly
Christian troops and by Syrian army gunners exploded in Christian
and Moslem districts on Monday, killing two people and wounding 15.
   That raised the toll to 180 people killed and 619 wounded since
the current round of civil war fighting erupted on March 8.
   Aoun had declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syrian forces.
The Syrians have responded by shelling the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   Syria is the country's main power broker with 40,000 troops
deployed in predominantly Moslem areas covering 70 percent of
Lebanese territory under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   France, which ruled Lebanon from the end of World War I until
independence in 1943, has voiced concern about the fate of
Lebanon's Christian community and sent a special envoy in an effort
to contain the crisis.
   The French government has not specified an arrival date for two
ships carrying humanitarian aid that set sail for Lebanon last
week, but press reports in Paris and Beirut said they were due
Wednesday.
   One vessel carries fuel and food. The other is a hospital ship
with beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies.
   There are fears the ships' arrival could trigger heavier
fighting.
   Lebanese Moslem and leftist leaders have rejected their share of
the French aid. Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, whose Progressive
Socialist Party militia is Syria's main ally in the current
confrontation with the Christians, also warned the French ships
against docking at any Christian port.
   The French envoy, Jean-Francois Deniau, accused Syria of trying
to block his mission by ordering its gunners last week to shell the
French embassy in Beirut's Christian suburb of Hazmiyeh where he
was staying.
   Deniau, vice president of the national assembly's foreign
affairs committee, warned today that opening fire at the French
ships ``would be an act of war against France.''
   The present confrontation broke out after Aoun ordered a
blockade of militia-run ports that have been stripping the state
treasury of about $100 million annually in taxes.

   South Africa today said black
nationalist guerrillas did not appear to be honoring an agreement
to leave Namibia so the territory's transition to independence can
resume.
   Guerrillas were to congregate at designated points so they can
be escorted to Angola under an agreement by South Africa, Angola
and Cuba.
   The agreement was reached in an effort to end fighting between
South African-led security forces and the guerrillas in northern
Namibia. The bloodshed began April 1, the day a U.N.-sponsored
truce was to begin as part of Namibia's transition to independence
after 74 years of South African rule.
   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand of Namibia's paramilitary police
reported ``a few skirmishes'' with South-West Africa People's
Organization guerrillas today and Monday.
   Du Rand put the latest death toll in the fighting at 265
guerrillas and 28 security force members.
   He said there was no sign that guerrillas were honoring an
agreement to cross the border north to Angola.
   ``About 10 small groups of three to seven men each have crossed
into Angola since Sunday, but that could be to re-supply themselves
or to rest,'' du Rand said. ``There is no indication of any major
movement north to the assembly points.''
   South Africa says about 1,900 SWAPO fighters began entering
Namibia on April 1, violating the U.N. agreement that calls for the
guerrillas to remain at their Angola bases until mid-May.
   It said the incursion might have been a deliberate attempt to
take advantage of the late deployment of a U.N. monitoring force,
and thus influence Namibian elections later in the year.
   Some Namibian observers said SWAPO units apparently did not know
they were breaking the peace accord by entering the territory.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma contended in Angola that some guerrillas
had been in Namibia all along, and had a right to be there. On
Sunday, reportedly under pressure from his Angolan and Cuban
allies, Nujoma ordered his fighters to leave Namibia.
   U.N. representative Martti Ahtisaari said messages were being
broadcast on radio advising guerrillas to go to churches in the
north as a preliminary step before reporting to U.N. assembly
points.
   Nujoma said Monday in a radio interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. that there is confusion about how to spread word
of the withdrawal to his fighters. He said radio broadcasts were
useless because the guerrillas had no radios.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I and, until last
year, defied U.N. resolutions demanding that it withdraw. It has
agreed to a U.N.-brokered regional peace accord with Cuba and
Angola.
   Under the agreement, Cuba is pulling 50,000 troops out of
Angola, where they had fought Angolan rebels backed by South Africa.
   About 100 British and Australian troops moved into northern
Namibia under the U.N. flag Monday to help monitor the SWAPO
pullout. The guerrillas had until Saturday to leave but Louis
Pienaar, South African administrator general in Namibia, said the
deadline might not be strictly enforced if SWAPO needed more time.
   In Oshakati, a military stronghold in northern Namibia, police
Chief Inspector Derek Brune said helicopter gunships were used
Monday in a skirmish at Ruacana, near the Angolan border.
   ``We are not going out to look for SWAPO at this stage. We are
giving them a chance to gather at the assembly points,'' he said.
   Ahtisaari said no official cease-fire was in effect but that
South Africa would restrain its forces.
   Ahtisaari said each assembly point would be staffed by 10 U.N.
soldiers and five monitors, and would fly blue and white U.N.
flags. He said other U.N. personnel, monitoring the Cuban
withdrawal in Angola, would escort SWAPO fighters to Angolan bases.

<HEAD>Army Official Says Military Strikes on Terrorists Legal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military can legally attack
terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential order that bans
assassinations of individuals abroad, the Army's top uniformed
lawyer contends.
   Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the service's judge advocate general,
argued in an eight-page draft memorandum that because of changes in
``the nature of the threat,'' action against terrorists can be
justified on grounds of national self-defense.
   ``The employment of military force against a terrorist or
terrorist organization to protect U.S. citizens or the national
security of the United States is a legitimate exercise of the
international legal right of self-defense and does not constitute
assassination,'' Overholt concluded.
   Under that legal reasoning, a soldier who shot and killed a
terrorist could not be accused of an illegal assassination.
   Overholt's memorandum was disclosed Monday by the newsletter
Defense Week and confirmed by Army officials.
   Lt. Col. Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman, said the service had
been encouraging legal debate within the Defense and State
departments, the CIA and other agencies in hopes of producing a
common definition of assassination.
   ``The Army is attempting to update it basic `Law of Land
Warfare' field manual, which hasn't been revised since 1956,''
Bridges said.
   ``The existing manual has a definition for assassination, which
doesn't mean anything, that dates to the Hague Convention of
1907,'' he said. ``This is an attempt to define what is an
assassination and what is prohibited and what is not.''
   On assassination, the Hague Convention said simply: ``It is
especially forbidden to kill or wound treacherously individuals
belonging to the hostile nation or army.''
   Bridges said Overholt circulated the memo for comment last
October and that State Department and CIA attorneys are still
considering it.
   The document noted that a prohibition against assassination will
mean different things in wartime and peacetime. War, in essence,
legalizes the ``killing of the enemy,'' it said.
   During peacetime, it added, the standards of conduct must be
defined under the United Nations Charter, ``which recognizes the
inherent right of self-defense of nations,'' and domestic laws and
regulations.
   President Ford in 1976 signed Presidential Order 12333 banning
attempts to assassinate foreign public leaders.
   In the intervening 13 years, ``the nature of the threat has
changed, rather than the international legal right to respond to
the threat,'' Overholt's memo said.
   ``It is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations
envisaged as appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed
response by U.S. military forces are well-financed, highly
organized paramilitary structures engaged full time in the illegal
use of force,'' it continued.
   ``The (national) right of self-defense would be appropriate to
the attack of terrorist leaders or terrorist infrastructure that
through their actions pose a continuing threat to U.S. citizens or
the national security of the United States.
   ``A national decision to employ military force in self-defense
against a legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that
employed in response to an overt conventional threat ....''

   The captain of a nuclear submarine that caught
fire and sank pulled one last sailor through its smoke-filled hatch
before plunging into icy waters and dying, reports said today.
   Soviet media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members, 42 of
whom died when the submarine caught went down in the Norwegian Sea
on Friday.
   The official Tass news agency said Capt. First Class Yevgeny
Vanin was the last person to leave the submarine when it started to
sink.
   ``But prior to that he looked once again into the submarine's
exit hatch belching out smoke. One of the seamen was there,'' Tass
said. ``The commander helped him to get out and only after that he
dived into the icy water, swimming towards the inflatable life
rafts.
   ``But too much energy was expended on the struggle for saving
the submarine and on helping his comrades. The commander died
before the very eyes of his fellow seamen,'' the agency said.
   Funeral services will be held Wednesday for the 42 crewmen. The
government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday that only 19 bodies
had been recovered.
   Izvestia said a short circuit likely caused the fire on board
the still-unidentified submarine as it was heading to port after a
long voyage.
   Sailors fought the blaze for hours, but several explosions
apparently cracked the hull and sank the vessel, Izvestia said.
Soviet officials said two of the submarine's 10 torpedoes were
nuclear-tipped, but there is no danger of a radioactive release
from either the torpedoes or the submarine's nuclear reactor.
   In a report from the Arctic port of Murmansk, the military
newspaper Red Star said planes dropped lift rafts for the sailors.
The newspaper quoted Maj. G. Petrogradskikh as saying the planes
could not help further, and the crew had to wait for surface ships
to arrive on the scene to save them.
   The first ship on the scene was a fishing vessel, the Alexei
Khlobystov. Three sailors who were rescued died of exposure on the
after they were on board, Tass said.
   The 27 survivors are out of danger and will be sent next week to
resorts in the southern Soviet Union, Tass said.
   The Norwegian Sea temperature was 36-37 degrees Fahrenheit, and
exposure to water that temperature can be fatal after 10 minutes,
Tass said. Some of the survivors were in the water for more than an
hour.

   A deranged man swinging a machete-like knife on
a busy street was shot to death by police after a stun gun failed
to stop him.
   The hulking man with a mohawk haircut kept screaming, ``You're
going to have to kill me or I'm going to kill you!'' during the
rampage Monday in midtown Manhattan, said Officer Richard O'Neill
of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
   ``They all did cartwheels to prevent having to shoot him,''
O'Neill said. ``The guy just wanted to die and nothing was going to
stop him.''
   The man, who carried no identification, swung an 18-inch knife
at pedestrians and scared a passerby into dropping his briefcase
and fleeing into a building before five police officers arrived,
police said.
   One officer sprayed Mace at the man but missed his face, police
said. A policeman fired two darts from a 50,000-volt stun gun, but
one apparently missed and the other may have failed to penetrate
his four shirts, they said.
   An officer shot the man twice from about three feet after he
twice lunged at the policeman with the knife, O'Neill said. The
victim, who was about 6 feet tall and around 200 pounds, died an
hour later, police said.
   Police said the man wielded a Gurkha knife with an angled steel
blade and a worn wooden handle. Gurkhas are warriors from the
mountains of Nepal known for their ferocity in battle. Their knives
can be purchased in stores in the city.
   Separately, police charged two men with assault and cocaine
possession in a machine-gun attack on a grocery store late Monday
that left six people wounded, one critically. Police said they had
no motive for the shootings.

<HEAD>Man Finds 100 Million Yen In Bamboo Thicket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 39-year-old restaurant owner looking for bamboo
shoots in a thicket found a bag containing about 100 million yen
($758,000), police said today.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
money may be connected with some crime because no one reported it
missing, although it apparently had been in the bamboo thicket for
several years.
   He said Seiei Sato, who owns a small shop that serves grilled
meat on a stick, reported the discovery to police today.
   The official said about a quarter of the cash had rotted and
other bills were damp and fragile. Some of the money _ all
10,000-yen bills _ was bundled with bank tape dated from 1985 to
1986.
   He said the bag was found in a thicket about 35 feet from a road
in Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo.
   Under Japanese law, Sato can have the money if no one claims it
within six months.
   In 1980, Hisao Onuki, a company driver, found 100 million yen
wrapped in a cloth in the Ginza, a major Tokyo shopping district.
The owner of the money did not turn up and the money went to Onuki.

   The government has won convictions of
four Puerto Rican nationalists in a $7.1 million heist. But the
militants' supporters claimed victory, saying the trial will help
the island gain independence.
   The four have maintained that the trial stemming from one of the
country's biggest cash heists was politically motivated. They and
their lawyers vowed to appeal Monday's verdicts.
   Carlos Ayes Suarez, who was acquitted, said prosecutors had
sought to ``criminalize the pro-independence movement in our
country.''
   But U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said the government's
case was vindicated: ``The defense put the system on trial and
after nine days the jury came back with a verdict that was well
reasoned and proved that the system works.''
   The government said the five defendants participated in the
Sept. 12, 1983, robbery at the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford
to raise funds to finance terrorist acts for Los Macheteros, a
violent group seeking Puerto Rican independence.
   Key defendant Juan Segarra Palmer III was convicted of robbery,
conspiracy and transportation of stolen money, but acquitted on
four weapons-related charges.
   Segarra's bond was revoked and he was led from the federal
courtroom by marshals as his supporters sang about revolution to
the tune of the Puerto Rican national anthem.
   The 39-year-old Harvard graduate faces up to 165 years in prison.
   Antonio Camacho Negron, 45, a car mechanic, and Roberto
Maldonado Rivera, 53, an attorney, were convicted of conspiracy and
transporting stolen money from Connecticut to Mexico. Camacho faces
up to 15 years in prison and Maldonado face up to five years.
   Norman Ramirez Talavera, 32, an artist, was convicted of
conspiracy and faces up to five years in prison.
   No sentencing date was set.
   Judge T. Emmet Clarie also revoked the bond of Camacho. After
the verdicts were read, Camacho raised a clenched fist and yelled
in Spanish, ``The imperial power is showing how small it is.''
   Ayes, a 29-year-old anthropology student, was acquitted of
conspiracy.
   The 5{-month trial had been delayed by marathon hearings on the
admissibility of FBI tape recordings and other evidence, which in
turn triggered a debate over record pretrial detentions of some
defendants.
   Segarra was held without bail for 2{ years before a judge
ordered him released on $1 million bond in February 1988.
   His attorney, Leonard Weinglass, called the verdict a sham
because the jury convicted Segarra of robbery while acquitting him
of robbery with use of a weapon.
   ``The jurors were divided, and so they split it down the middle.
That's a compromise. The verdict should be set aside,'' he said.
   The 12 jurors' identities were kept secret and the panel was
bused to the court from outside the city.
   The other defendants claimed they were the victims of mistaken
identity and were prosecuted for legitimate activities for Los
Macheteros, which means machete wielders.
   ``There are a lot of errors and it was a slim case,'' said
Camacho's attorney, Linda Backiel. ``Because he was a Puerto Rican
patriot, he never expected justice and he won't ask for mercy.''
   Camacho's wife, Rebecca, and two other supporters were arrested
later for blocking traffic outside the courthouse.
   ``As long as Puerto Rico is still a colony we have a moral
obligation to fight for the independence of our country by whatever
means are available,'' said Ayes, who said he would return to
Puerto Rico.
   ``All Puerto Ricans are Macheteros.''
   Victoria Barrera, a leader of the Connecticut Committee Against
Repression, considered the trial a victory because publicity
surrounding the case made Americans more aware of Puerto Ricans'
``struggle to be free and determine their fate.''
   Segarra acknowledged he knew about plans for the robbery and
received the stolen money to finance Los Macheteros. But he
steadfastly denied helping plan or execute the robbery.
   Prosecutors contended that Los Macheteros recruited Wells Fargo
guard Victor Gerena to carry out the robbery, then helped him
escape to Cuba, where he is believed to be living.
   The government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces
of evidence, including tape-recorded conversations and documents
seized from Los Macheteros members. Prosecutors presented evidence
that Los Macheteros was desperate for money in 1983 and put Segarra
in charge of getting funds.
   About $80,000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized
by FBI agents in Puerto Rico and Boston on Aug. 30, 1985, when 13
suspects were arrested. The government contends that Los Macheteros
spent about $1 million, moved more than $2 million to Cuba and
squirreled away about $4 million in safety deposit boxes,
certificates of deposit, savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in
Puerto Rico.
   Two other defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges before
the trial began. Nine others await trial.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech, Texas A&amp;M Researchers Duplicate Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, `Researchers at ...' to CORRECT to show that
Texas researchers have not definitively concluded they achieved fusion.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The container holding heavy water and an
electrode resembled a high school chemistry experiment. Only the
beeps of a neutron counter showed that nuclear fusion might really
be happening at room temperature.
   ``There's no question it's fusion,'' said Bill Livesay, a
metallurgist who worked on the project at Georgia Institute of
Technology here. ``I still don't believe it, even though I see it.''
   Researchers at Georgia Tech and at Texas A&amp;M University in
College Station, Texas, on Monday announced the results of separate
experiments that they said appeared to confirm a University of Utah
experiment that aroused tremendous skepticism when it was announced
last month.
   James Mahaffey, a senior researcher at Georgia Tech, said the
school's experiment began detecting the release of subatomic
neutron particles last weekend, a sure sign of fusion.
   ``It's open season on fusion,'' Mahaffey said.
   B. Stanley Pons, the chairman of the Utah chemistry department,
said he was elated and relieved by the announcements. He and a
colleague, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton,
England, sent scientists around the world scrambling with their
March 23 announcement of a controlled fusion reaction.
   ``This is just incredible,'' Pons said in Salt Lake City. ``If
they indeed have measured the neutron production, that's a real
breakthrough. My sincere congratulations to Georgia Tech.''
   Nuclear fusion _ the melding together of two atoms with an
accompanying release of energy _ normally requires enormously high
temperatures. It is the energy source of the sun and hydrogen bombs.
   Scientists have sought for decades to harness fusion's power
because it holds the potential to provide an almost unlimited
supply of relatively clean, cheap energy.
   Unlike nuclear reactors that use fission _ the splitting of
atoms _ to derive power, fusion doesn't generate significant
radioactive waste.
   In the Georgia experiment, which was kept behind lead shielding,
probes that normally measure 40 neutrons an hour in background
radiation were measuring 600 an hour.
   Mahaffey cautioned that his team had not confirmed whether the
process produces more energy than it consumes.
   Texas A&amp;M researchers said their experiment generated a net
1.144 watts of energy in the form of heat. They didn't measure
neutrons.
   The Texas researchers believed the output was the result of
fusion but said they weren't ready to rule out the possibility that
a chemical reaction was the cause.
   ``This is a very unusual result, and we have not totally
dismissed the possibility of some unusual chemical process which we
might have not accounted for and we are currently exploring this
possibility further,'' said Charles Martin, an electro-chemist at
Texas A&amp;M.
   As in Utah, both the Georgia and Texas researchers used a
palladium electrode to pass electric current through heavy water, a
form of water that contains a heavy isotope of hydrogen. The
Georgia researchers said they cut the time needed for the palladium
to soak in heavy water by first baking it in a vacuum.
   ``There is a need for much more money for research in this area
if it is going to get the attention it deserves,'' said Martin.
``But that's not surprising since this didn't exist two weeks ago.''

   The Confederate Home for Women, where eight
elderly daughters of Civil War soldiers were told they would be
taken care of for life, was doomed to close because of dwindling
financial support, its chairman said.
   Janet Burhans, president and chairman of the Board of Managers
for Needy Confederate Women, said Monday she was too embarrassed to
say how much money remained in the trust fund that supports the
home and women.
   The women, ages 84 to 98, will be moved to more modern quarters
20 miles outside of Richmond to make way for the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts.
   The two-story building is nestled among the magnolias behind the
museum. Once the women are moved, the antiques filling the home
will be sold and the museum will move in.
   The women had signed over their belongings and any future
inheritances in exchange for their support at the home. They will
lose dozens of worn but valuable antiques in use in the home.
   In exchange for the home, the state will pay the cost for the
women to live at a suburban retirement center.
   Officials at the home declined requests to interview the
residents on Monday.
   The home _ with its parquet floors, arched doorways, marble
fireplace, antique furniture and portraits of Confederate heroes _
was built in 1931 and now needs extensive repairs, Ms. Burhans said.
   She said replacing the roof cost $300,000. The home also needs
new plumbing and a new heating system, which would cost four times
that amount, she said.
   ``The state was not going to appropriate the money to repair the
home as a residence for eight ladies,'' she said. As many as 79
women once lived there.
   Not all the board members were in favor of moving the women.
   ``The museum wants our home,'' said board member Faye Oliff.
``They want it so bad.
   ``They've been like damn vultures waiting for the ladies to die
so they can get it.''
   Ms. Oliff said she tried unsuccessfully to persuade other board
members to open the home to paying descendants of Confederate
soldiers. The board also denied her proposal that a smaller home
for the women be opened about eight blocks away.
   Ms. Burhans said watching the women leave will be hard. They
will be taken to see a retirement home this week.
   ``They are very well-adjusted,'' said Holly C. DeJarnette, the
home's administrator.
   The home's board is to meet Thursday to decide where the women
will go, Ms. Burhans said.

   Voters in the town where Wild Bill Hickok
was gunned down in a card game were asked today to take their
community back to the days of the Wild West and approve poker,
blackjack and slot machines.
   Under an amendment to the South Dakota Constitution last year,
gambling limited to $5 bets will be allowed if 60 percent of
Deadwood voters approve it.
   Mayor Tom Blair predicted gambling would attract at least
200,000 additional tourists a year. He estimated gaming could
generate $500,000 to further promote tourism by restoring an Old
West look to the Gold Rush town.
   ``While we're trying to go forward economically, we're going to
the past to give us that boost,'' Blair said.
   A recent telephone survey of 900 of Deadwood's 1,200 registered
voters confirmed widespread support for legalized gambling, the
mayor said.
   A muted minority has opposed gambling as promoting lawlessness.
   ``There is opposition here in town, and it's basically on moral
grounds,'' said the Rev. Don Hadrick of the United Methodist Church.
   Hickok, the U.S. marshal and frontiersman, was shot in the back
of the head during a poker game at a saloon called No. 10 in 1876.
Legend has it he was clutching a pair each of aces and eights,
ever-after known as the ``dead man's hand.''

   A jury resumed deliberating today whether
three executives with a California company took part in the bribery
of a Navy official in order to win a $24 million contract from the
military.
   The four women and eight men weighing the case against Dale
Schnittjer, Eugene Sullivan and George Kaub began studying the
evidence at mid-afternoon on Monday, exactly a week after the trial
started.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams allowed jurors to go home
after they failed to reach a verdict in eight hours.
   All three defendants are former vice presidents at Teledyne
Electronics in Newbury Park, Calif. All are charged with
conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud for a scheme the government says
involved paying bribes to a Navy engineer in exchange for his
confidential information about a $24 million contract to build
hand-held radar equipment.
   Kaub is also charged with two counts of making false statements.
All the charges carry sentences of five years, except for bribery,
which carries a 15-year penalty. The fine is $250,000 on each count.
   ``This was a case about bribery, cheating and lying _ that's
exactly what it was,'' said assistant U.S. attorney Joseph Aronica,
summing up the case in his closing argument.
   The government tried to show in the trial that Schnittjer, Kaub
and Sullivan knew a private consultant hired by Teledyne
Electronics had paid bribes to Stuart Berlin, the Navy engineer.
   But defense attorneys depicted their clients as victims of a
conspiracy perpetrated by Berlin, private consultants William
Parkin and Fred Lackner and Michael Savaides, Teledyne's marketing
representative in Washington.
   Stanley Mortenson, Schnittjer's attorney, said his client had
``nothing to do in that decision'' to pay Parkin, he said. ``Dale
Schnittjer is innocent.''
   Parkin, Berlin, Lackner and Savaides have pleaded guilty and are
cooperating with the government in the first trial arising from the
``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation that began nearly three years
ago. The investigation, which focused on the $150-billion-a-year
purchasing system at the Defense Department, attracted national
attention when search warrants were issued for offices
coast-to-coast last June.
   Teledyne Industries, the parent company of the electronics firm,
also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements. The
company paid a total of $4.3 million in fines, penalties and
damages.
   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's lawyer, said the executive was trapped
without knowing it by the actions of Parkin and his associates.
   ``This was their own conspiracy ... their conspiracy to defraud
Teledyne and then hide the ball,'' he said, referring to Parkin and
his compatriots. ``My client was kept in the dark,'' said George
O'Connell, Sullivan's attorney.
   But Aronica said the Teledyne executives were part of the scheme
to defraud the government. They were responsible for agreeing to
pay Parkin $10,000 in November 1985 to help win the radar contract.
   Once the contract was awarded, Parkin's deal called for him to
receive $150,000, a portion of which he got before Ill Wind was
made public.
   ``But for these defendants, the grease for the skids would not
have flowed,'' Aronica said.
   ``They aided and abetted in getting the money to Parkin,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The city's first black school superintendent may
lose his job four years after many hailed his hiring as another
step in healing racial bitterness that stemmed from court-ordered
busing.
   The Boston School Committee is expected to vote whether to renew
the contract of Laval S. Wilson. Even though the committee voted
8-5 in October to rehire him, months of debate has changed some
members' minds.
   A recent straw poll showed six opposing renewal, five favoring
it and two undecided.
   Wilson's detractors say he lacks leadership abilities and accuse
him of not doing enough to lower the high dropout rate.
   Supporters of the 53-year-old Chicago native say he needs more
time to develop his programs and begin new ones. They also say
Wilson is dedicated and hard-working.
   The city has been rocked by racial tension and violence in the
years following the 1974 desegration order.
   ``This isn't a racial issue, it's a competence and quality
issue,'' said Peggy Davis-Mullen, a white member of the board.
``He's a diligent worker, but his approach isn't meeting the needs
of the children of Boston.''
   Although the school budget has increased in four years by about
$100 million, to $361 million, Mrs. Davis-Mullen said the dropout
rate has gone up. ``I don't think he has a firm grasp of the type
of students we have here,'' she said.
   In 1972, enrollment was 96,000, 60 percent of them white. Today,
there are 59,000 students, 24 percent white.
   School committee member Jean McGuire, who in 1985 voted against
hiring Wilson because of his conservative philosophies, said the
superintendent deserves more of a chance. She is one of four black
members on the board.
   ``You really can't get anything done changing horses in
midstream. Just changing who it is right now isn't going to change
a thing,'' she said. The system has had eight superintendents in
the last 19 years.
   Wilson also is backed by members of the Vault, the nickname for
a group of 25 prominent bankers and business executives interested
in education and urban issues.
   Vault Chairman Harold Hestnes, a lawyer, said Monday that
Wilson's difficulties were based on the size of the school
committee and its competing constituencies.
   ``Working with a 13-member school committee seems impossible to
me,'' Hestnes said. ``It's a difficult system under the best of
circumstances and he isn't in the best of circumstances.''
   Two committee members met with Wilson on Monday night, but
declined to comment.
   Wilson also has declined to comment. He did not return telephone
messages on Monday. His attorney, Fletcher Wiley, said the
committee was obligated to rehire him based on October's vote.
   Recently, at the request of the school committee, Wilson gave
himself a report card. He gave himself high marks for dedication,
for raising math and reading scores on national standardized tests
and for lowering the dropout rate.
   Test scores have risen only marginally, and the dropout rate is
in dispute.
   By Wilson's figures, fewer youngsters are quitting school. Other
school system figures, however, show increasing attrition in class
size between ninth grade and graduation day. The class of 1983 was
33 percent smaller than when it began; the class of '87 eroded by
40 percent.
   He said he could do better at sharing power and consulting with
community groups and parents. But his bottom line was that he
needed more time.
   ``The Boston public schools didn't develop problems overnight,
and neither Laval Wilson nor any other superintendent will solve
them overnight,'' Wilson wrote in the assessment.
   He said if he kept the job, he would push his Boston Education
Plan, which focuses on improving math and reading and giving
principals and teachers more latitude.
   One problem he's faced in the contract negotiations has been his
timing.
   Last fall, for example, he asked for an $18,000 housing
allowance on top of his $95,000 salary. The request came at a time
when school budget cuts loomed. After much criticism, he withdrew
the allowance proposal. He now is asking for a three-year contract
starting at $95,000, with future raises linked to what is given to
teachers and administrators.
   Shortly after he was hired, he was granted his request for a
$15,000 raise.

<TEXT>
   Sweden's security police keep files on
people's political views and too often work in secret and on the
margins of the law, a government report said today.
   The report followed the resignation Monday of Sune Sandstrom,
head of the secret service since 1987. He said the government had
lost confidence in him and apparently wanted a more political man
in the job, rather than ``only a policeman.''
   The secret service came under sharp attack after the 1986
assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme because some security
officials took part in a private hunt for a suspect.
   The new 215-page report urged tighter supervision of the secret
service and greater documentation of its work.
   It was compiled over six months by Carl Lidbom, Sweden's
ambassador to France, and submitted to the government today. The
government ordered the report independently of the Palme scandal
when the agency came under criticism for keeping political files
and other issues.
   Lidbom confirmed that the Sakerhetspolis, or SAPO as the
Security Police are known, kept files on political opinions of
civil servants and citizens. In most cases, the practice is barred
by the constitution.
   The ambassador also said SAPO may have used illegal wiretaps in
some of its anti-terrorist and counterespionage operations.
   ``Seemingly, it has been characteristic for SAPO to conduct its
work in a gray zone between the legal and illegal, the ethical and
unethical,'' the report said.
   The disclosure of irregularities in the private operation to
find Palme's killer shadowed the government of Prime Minister
Ingvar Carlsson for most of last year.
   Several SAPO officers were enlisted in a private investigation.
They were uncovered smuggling eavesdropping equipment into the
country.
   The scandal led to the resignations of a national police chief
and a justice minister.
   A 42-year-old man suspected in Palme's killing was arrested Dec.
14. Officials have said the trial of the suspect, Christer
Pettersson, will start May 29. Pettersson has denied he shot Palme.
   At a news conference today, Lidbom recommended that Sandstom's
replacement ``have broader experience'' and not necessarily come
from the ranks of the national police.
   He also said the agency should be required to gain prior
approval for wiretapping from the justice chancellor or another
oversight body.
   Lidbom, a senior member of the governing Social Democratic
Party, was a controversial choice to investigate the secret
service, since he was sharply critical of SAPO in the past.
   He said SAPO had followed the lead of other countries'
intelligence agencies in working in secret. He did not name the
other nations.
   ``It has become the practice to leave as few tracks as
possible,'' he said of the agency's working methods.

   Oliver North used his ``good offices'' in an
attempt to help Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord get a
half-million dollars for renting a ship to the CIA, the prosecutor
at North's trial said today.
   North said that, acting on behalf of Secord, he offered the
Danish-registered ship Erria to the CIA, which eventually turned
down the offer.
   ``He could make for renting this ship as much as $500,000,''
prosecutor John Keker said as North took the witness stand in U.S.
District Court for a fourth day.
   ``And that is totally separate from any'' situation involving
``me,'' the former National Security Council aide responded.
   North is accused of accepting a $13,800 home security system
from Secord free of charge.
   ``You are using your good offices to rent this ship,'' said
Keker.
   ``No,'' responded North. He pointed out that the CIA decided not
to rent the ship, which was to have been used by the CIA to
broadcast into Libya.
   Keker presented messages that Secord had sent to North stating
that the ship was worth more than $400,000. Keker said the ship had
cost $300,000.
   One of the messages says Secord would charge $50,000 a month for
risk for six months.
   ``Another word for risk is profit,'' said Keker. North had
enlisted Secord, a retired Air Force major general, to run arms to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   On Monday, the prosecutor questioned whether Secord had helped
pay for a motor vehicle for North.
   North said he paid for the vehicle and other possessions by
dipping into a family fund created by insurance settlements and
years of yard sales, puppy sales and collecting spare change _ not
the cash intended for Iran-Contra activities.
   North said the $15,000 family fund got its start in 1967 with an
insurance settlement from an auto crash and he tossed spare change
into the metal box bolted to the closet floor when he came home at
night.
   ``We had a yard sale or two, and I think my wife sold some
puppies,'' North added.
   ``The change out of your pocket grew to $15,000 in your house?''
Keker asked. North said yes.
   Keker tried to show during cross-examination that North played
loose with the $240,000 to $300,000 that North administered from an
office safe to finance the Iran arms initiative and aid the
Nicraguan rebels.
   Keker suggested that Secord helped North pay for a used
Chevrolet Suburban that cost $8,038.
   Keker also tried to show that North arranged for $200,000 in
free life insurance, allowed his colleagues to make huge profits on
Iran-Contra dealings, and accepted a free security fence.
   ``I got a lot of money from General Secord on a lot of
occasions,'' North said when asked whether he had gotten money from
Secord on Oct. 5, 1985, the day he bought the car.
   North had enlisted Secord to run arms and other supplies to the
Contras during a two-year ban on military aid to the rebels.
   The cash fund North operated out of his office safe was financed
by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and by Secord, whose office was a
mile or two away from the car dealership.
   ``This car has nothing to do with Calero or Secord, but with the
fund that Ollie North set up in 1967,'' North said firmly.
   The quarter of a million dollars or more he spent out of his
office safe went to support the Contras and the Iran arms
initiative and ``that's what it was used for,'' North testified.
   North said he destroyed the ledger which tracked the money in
his office safe on orders from then-CIA Director William Casey. The
order came after a Contra resupply plane was shot down in Nicaragua
on Oct. 5, 1986, threatening to expose the covert operation, he
said. North is accused of converting $4,300 from the office safe
fund to his own use.
   ``You had gotten loose,'' Keker snapped.
   ``I hadn't gotten loose,'' North snapped back. ``I was working
my tail off.''
   ``You had loosened up the standards,'' said Keker.
   ``You said that. I hadn't,'' insisted North.

   Police said today they were holding three
Jewish men in connection with a submachine gun attack in which one
Palestinian was killed and three others were wounded.
   The announcement came shortly after police fired rubber bullets
at stone throwers, wounding one in the leg, during an hourlong
funeral march for the slain Palestinian.
   The three detainees ``are suspected of being linked to what
happened yesterday'' but are not suspected of the actual shooting,
Jerusalem Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri said.
   He declined to identify the men beyond saying two were from
Jerusalem and one lived elsewhere in Israel. The suspects were
detained Monday night and were still in custody, Sanduri said.
   Mourners decried Israel during the funeral procession through
the Temple Mount compound, some shouting ``We warn the Jews:
Mohammed's army will return.''
   Police opened fire after one youth smashed a window with his
fist and others broke two windows with rocks.
   About 1,000 relatives and friends took part in the funeral march
for Khaled Shawish, the 26-year-old blacksmith killed Monday when
an attacker, dressed in army fatigues and believed to be an
Israeli, opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun.
   The gunman, who escaped on foot, also wounded three other
Palestinians in the attack outside the Jaffa Gate entrance to the
Old Walled City of Jerusalem.
   A caller claiming to represent a Jewish extremist group claimed
responsibility for the shootings.
   Earlier today, several dozen masked Palestinian youths gathered
at Shawish's Old City home, waving Palestinian flags and vowing
revenge against Jews. Police watched from nearby rooftops.
   One youth, masked with a kafiyyeh and hoisted on the shoulders
of another, shouted: ``We should teach the Jews a lesson.
Everything Jewish in this town should be burned. We should prove
that this is Palestinian and teach them a lesson of what a
Palestinian state means.''
   Other youths shouted ``Revolution against the occupier!'' and
``We want a Palestinian state!''
   One Associated Press reporter taking notes was grabbed and
threatened by masked youths. Another was hit in the stomach with a
rock.
   In Arab east Jerusalem today, most merchants shuttered their
shops in a general strike called to protest Monday's shootings.
   A general strike today virtually closed the occupied Gaza Strip,
where leaflets from the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement urged
residents to protest the deportation of more than 40 Palestinians
by Israel during the 16-month Palestinian uprising.
   In the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, merchants shut their
shops today to mourn a 22-year-old Palestinian who was shot to
death in a clash with soldiers on Monday night.
   The death raised to 423 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died.
   Arab reports said four Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire
during stone-throwing protests today in Gaza, including a
90-year-old woman who was hit by a bullet in the left leg in the
Shati refugee camp.
   Stoning protests were reported in Ramallah and several
neighboring West Bank camps, but there were no reported casualties.
   In Tel Aviv today, an Israeli teen-ager stabbed and wounded two
Arab youths from the Gaza Strip, injuring one of them seriously,
police said. The stabbings occurred during an argument that began
when the Palestinian youths sought to park their truck and unload
chickens outside a butcher shop, police spokesman Dalia Gilad said.
   Israel radio said the butcher's 17-year-old son threatened the
Palestinians and then stabbed them.
   An anonymous caller telephoned reporters Monday night to claim
responsibility for the shootings in Jerusalem for the Sicarites, a
group named after Jewish assassins who fought the Roman forces
nearly 2,000 years ago.
   The caller, who spoke Hebrew with a French or North African
accent, said the shootings were in retaliation for stone-throwing
attacks on Jews during the Palestinian uprising.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said police were ``quite
sure the assailant was Jewish'' but had not determined his motive.
   Sicarites members have asserted responsibility or been blamed
for at least eight arson attacks against Israeli moderates. But
they have not attacked Arabs directly and there were no known
casualties in the previous incidents.
   Monday's shootings came as tensions ran high in the Old City.
About 350,000 Jews and 135,000 Arabs live in east Jerusalem, which
Israel seized in 1967 from Jordan and has annexed.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev announced Monday that some
Palestinian youths would be barred from praying at one of Islam's
holiest sites, the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, because of rioting
there Friday.
   During the riot by an estimated 4,000 Palestinians, rocks were
thrown near the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine. Twelve
people were reported injured and 37 Arabs were arrested.

   Bishop William Keeler of Harrisburg, Pa., was
named leader today of the nation's oldest archdiocese.
   Keeler, 58, succeeds Archbishop William D. Borders, who
submitted his resignation in accordance with church law after
turning 75 in October.
   Keeler, bishop in Harrisburg since 1984, was chairman of the
U.S. Bishop's Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs
and arranged meetings between the pope and other faith groups
during the pope's U.S. visit in 1987.
   The Baltimore archdiocese covers nine counties and serves
438,000 Catholics. It was founded 200 years ago.
   A native of San Antonio, Texas, Keeler grew up in Lebanon, Pa.,
and earned degrees from St. Charles Seminary in Philadelphia and
Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained in 1955.
   Borders had headed the Baltimore archdiocese since 1974.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Finds Probable Gift-Reporting Violations by Wright</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf pvs, The committee, with new grafs 7-10 to update
with deliberations resuming, comment from panel members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ethics Committee has concluded that
Speaker Jim Wright probably violated the chamber's rules by failing
to report benefits from a Texas business partner as gifts.
   A source familiar with the investigation said late Monday that
the committee has found ``reason to believe'' that Wright violated
the gift-reporting rules on benefits given to him and his wife by
the business associate in Fort Worth.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to say
how many instances of failure to report gifts had been identified
by the panel.
   But the number could easily be in the dozens, because several
benefits Wright received continued over a period of years and would
have had to be reported on each year's financial disclosure form.
Among the benefits under scrutiny are his virtually free use of a
condominium in Texas, an $18,000 salary for his wife, Betty, and
use of a 1979 Cadillac.
   CBS News reported Monday that the committee had found about 30
instances of possible rules violations by Wright.
   ``We think it's an absurd report,'' said Mark Johnson, Wright's
press secretary. ``We have absolutely no information along those
lines.''
   The committee resumed deliberations today, and senior members of
the panel said they still hoped to reach some conclusions in the
case this week. But neither chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., nor
senior Republican John Myers of Indiana, would comment on votes
taken so far.
   ``I'm not going to judge whether the reports are premature or
not premature,'' Dixon told reporters.
   ``There's some truth and some misinformation about every
statement we've read,'' added Myers.
   The panel's current deliberations are not unlike those of a
grand jury.
   Finding ``reason to believe'' that rules have been violated
would be equivalent to an indictment of Wright. The speaker would
then have a chance to defend himself in a disciplinary hearing, the
equivalent of a trial.
   Wright reported his wife's employment with Fort Worth developer
George Mallick on his financial disclosure forms as salary for her
work. But the ethics panel's outside counsel, Richard Phelan,
argued that the salary amounted to a gift because Mrs. Wright did
little work in exchange for it.
   Wright, Mallick and their wives jointly formed a small
investment company called ``Mallightco'' and used it to make
several investments. Mrs. Wright first drew her salary directly
from Mallick's development company and then from the partnership
between 1981 and 1984.
   Wright made no mention on the disclosure forms of the car or the
condominium, which he now contends were simply fringe benefits from
Mrs. Wright's employment.
   Remaining to be resolved are a number of more serious charges
against Wright, including whether Mallick had ``direct interest in
legislation'' before Congress. That would make any gift worth more
than $100 improper under House rules.
   Also remaining to be decided is whether Wright used his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' as a device to evade limits on
outside income. In several instances the speaker made bulk sales of
the book to interest groups in lieu of accepting speaking fees.
   Honoraria for speeches are limited under the rules, but book
royalties are not.
   The committee is struggling with the question of whether Wright,
in the committee's parlance, ``recharacterized'' money that was
intended as a speaking fee into book income _ or whether the book
sales constitute an entirely separate and permissible business deal.
   The ethics panel since last June has been conducting what it
terms a ``preliminary inquiry'' and has spent upwards of $1 million
on investigating Wright's dealings over the past four decades.
   If it finds reason to believe rules were violated in any of the
dozens of instances cited by its outside counsel, the panel would
vote to include them in a statement of alleged violation.
   Wright would have up to 21 days to respond. Then the committee
would vote on whether to proceed to a disciplinary hearing.
   If the committee concludes that the allegations have been
proven, it can recommend that the full House impose punishment
ranging from a reprimand or denial of privileges to expulsion.
   If the committee finds the violations to be only ``technical,''
it may recommend no punishment. Wright, in recent weeks, has argued
that any violations he may have committed would fall into that
category.

   A fire and explosion at a Chevron
refinery shot flames 100 feet into the air and injured at least
seven workers fighting the blaze, authorities said.
   The fire, which burned for four hours Monday and sent a black
cloud over much of the eastern San Francisco Bay, cut production
capacity at Chevron's second-largest West Coast refinery by 25
percent, the company said.
   Chevron would not speculate on the amount of damage or predict
when the refinery, which produces gasoline and jet fuel, would be
back at full production.
   To make up the loss, Chevron said it will increase shipments
from its other Western refineries and from other areas, including
the Gulf of Mexico.
   Chevron was investigating the cause of the blast.
   At least four workers were hospitalized in stable condition with
burns or smoke inhalation, authorities said.
   There was no immediate word on the condition of others reported
hurt.
   Gas oil, which is processed into gasoline, burned during the
fire but did posed no danger to the public, said Chevron spokesman
Hal Holt.

<HEAD>Open Letter Asks Bush To Stop Outside Interference in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 600 international writers,
scientists, religious leaders, academics and artists have signed an
open letter asking President Bush to stop outside interference in
Nicaragua.
   Signatories ask Bush not to meddle in regional peace efforts and
to lift a U.S. trade embargo imposed against the leftist Sandinista
government four years ago. They suggest Bush talk directly to
Nicaraguan officials.
   ``We believe that good faith must be translated into actions.
This is the moment for you to restore direct dialogue with
Nicaragua,'' says the letter.
   A Spanish version was released to local and foreign journalists
by President Daniel Ortega's press office in Managua. An aide said
the letter would be published in New York today.
   It was signed, among others, by Cuban dancer Alicia Alonso,
Spanish poet Rafael Alberti, American actor Ed Asner, Italian film
director Bernardo Bertolucci, Brazilian composer Chico Buarque de
Holando and American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein.
   Other signatories included actress Geraldine Chaplin and authors
Carlos Fuentes, Graham Greene, Gunter Grass and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez.
   Central American nations should be allowed to ``resolve on their
own their own affairs, without any foreign interference,'' the
letter said.
   ``Peace in Nicaragua must immediately be re-established.''
   To help bring peace, it said, foreign countries must support
accords reached by the five Central American presidents Feb. 14 in
El Salvador.
   At the February summit, Ortega promised to institute democratic
reforms and hold elections in February 1990, 10 months earlier than
planned.
   Ortega also freed nearly 2,000 National Guards jailed for almost
a decade since the July 1979 triumph of the Sandinista revolution.
   Ortega and the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Honduras also agreed to produce by mid-May a plan for
dismantling the Nicaraguan rebel force known as the Contras.
   Some 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, have been
living at border camps in Honduras since Congress cut off lethal
aid to the U.S.-backed guerrillas in February 1988.
   Ortega has criticized Bush's recently announced proposal for a
Contra aid package of up to $45 million in humanitarian aid over 10
months.
   The Nicaraguan leader maintains it would hurt regional peace
efforts.

   Royal aide Timothy Laurence, whose letters to
Princess Anne have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble,
was dropped from Queen Elizabeth II's entourage at the public
premiere of a new London musical.
   But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that Laurence had
remained on duty back at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London.
   The bachelor, a Royal Navy commander, had been scheduled to
accompany the queen, Anne's mother, to a charity performance Monday
night of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's new show, ``Aspects of
Love,'' in London's West End.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of four of Laurence's
letters to Anne from the palace, speculation about her 15-year
marriage to Mark Phillips made front-page news again today in
London's royal-mad tabloids.
   Phillips, a farmer and equestrian, is a former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards. Rumors his marriage to Anne is in trouble
have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six
months a year apart.
   They have two children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   ``Dashing queen's equerry (aide) Tim Laurence is `besotted' with
Princess Anne and believes she loves him too,'' The Sun, Britain's
largest circulation newspaper, reported today, quoting unnamed
friends of Laurence.
   ``The handsome 34-year-old Naval Commander often speaks to her
on the phone late at night, sometimes for more than an hour. And he
meets her secretly whenever possible in London or at country
homes.''
   Anne's father-in-law, Maj. Peter Phillips, denied Monday that
the marriage was on the rocks, and said he spoke to his son as
recently as Sunday.
   ``He would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the
conversation was about horses,'' Phillips said.
   ``It's not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would
understand at all _ they spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together ... Of course their marriage is very unusual.''
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said Anne,
38, and her 40-year-old husband were reunited for six hours
overnight at their country mansion, Gatcombe Park, 90 miles west of
London, after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in
northwest England.
   The news agency said Anne arrived home after midnight but left
about 6 a.m. to go horseback riding. When she returned three hours
later to prepare for engagements in London, Phillips had left the
house. His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said today he was
somewhere in Spain but gave no details.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired member
of Britain's royal family. As president of the Save the Children
Fund charity, she travels on behalf of children in poverty-stricken
and war-torn Third World countries. Phillips also travels widely on
various business and equestrian interests.
   The latest speculation about the couple's marriage began after
The Sun reported Thursday that it had been sent anonymously four
letters stolen from Anne's desk at Buckingham Palace.
   The Sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had
turned them over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the author, the palace identified Laurence.
   Royalty correspondent Richard Kay wrote today in The Daily Mail
``Anne and Mark no longer have a marriage in the conventional
sense.''
   But Kay predicted: ``There won't be any announcement of a
divorce ... For it is she... who has brought back much
respectability to the royal family at a time when popularity and
support are on the wane... Certainly the old guard at the palace
would be appalled at the thought of another divorce within the
royal family.''
   Princess Margaret, Anne's aunt and the queen's only sister, was
divorced in 1978 from Lord Snowdon, who has since remarried.

is to go forward, said sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The unions demanded that the bankruptcy court appoint a trustee
to operate Eastern as the airline emerges from Chapter 11, union
sources said.
   A union legal adviser told The Associated Press the demand was
aimed at assuring ``speedy and orderly transition.''
   ``We're more than a little concerned about what can happen while
Lorenzo is on his way out,'' the source said.
   An exhausted Ueberroth told reporters outside the courthouse
Monday evening, ``We have one more major bridge to cross ... and
that's right here in this courthouse. That bridge must be crossed.
... There's no guarantee we will cross it.''
   Ueberroth's deal with Texas Air is scheduled to expire at
midnight.
   ``We have not yet seen a copy of the agreement. We understand it
is very complex and we will study it,'' Texas Air spokesman Art
Kent said late Monday from the company's headquarters in Houston.
   ``There's no agreement as far as we're concerned,'' said Bruce
Zirinsky, a lawyer for Eastern who attended the New York meetings.
   After four days of intense negotiations, Ueberroth announced
that his investor group had reached ``a historic labor
partnership'' with leaders representing Eastern's Machinists,
pilots and flight attendants unions.
   Sources said the five-year agreement gives the unions a 30
percent share of Miami-based Eastern in exchange for $210 million
in pay cuts and work-rule concessions. The accord must be ratified
by rank-and-file members.
   Ueberroth and other parties to the talks have declined to give
details because of a gag order imposed by Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland. Ueberroth said talks would continue today in an effort
to get Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, back in the
air.
   Eastern has been largely grounded since Machinists struck March
4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support. The
airline filed for bankruptcy protection five days later.
   Under the agreement, the Machinists union would give up about
$150 million in wage and benefit cuts or ``essentially what Lorenzo
wanted us to take before the strike,'' a union source said. The
figures are smaller for other unions because after Lorenzo bought
Eastern three years ago, the pilots and flight attendants accepted
pay cuts, but the Machinists did not.
   The pact must be approved by Eastern's major creditors as well
as Texas Air.
   The agreement was reached early Monday in Washington, and
participants flew rival Pan Am Corp.'s shuttle to New York and
continued talks at the bankruptcy courthouse in Manhattan.
   Lawyers for Eastern and some of its creditors were at the
courthouse meetings.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci also was present for
some of the meetings, but he declined to identify his role.
Carlucci is a vice chairman of the Carlyle Group, a Washington
investment firm.
   Union sources said Carlucci's name surfaced several weeks ago as
a possible candidate for the trustee position.
   Court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro was instrumental in
forging the agreement with the unions, sources said. He had been in
almost non-stop meetings with Ueberroth's representatives in
Washington since Thursday night.
   ``It wouldn't have happened without him,'' said a participant in
the talks. Shapiro gave the impression he would have ``thrown
people in jail'' if they had walked out of the discussions, the
source said.
   The agreement also would cover 11,000 non-union employees,
including reservation clerks, ticket agents and clerical workers,
Ueberroth said.
   A representative of non-union employees, Mary Grace Shore, said
her group objected to not being represented in the talks.
   Eastern has said it could resume 80 percent of its pre-strike
schedule within about 10 days after a final agreement is approved
by all parties, although some union officials have said it could
take 45 days or longer.

<TEXT>
   Twelve long-term Jewish ``refuseniks,'' many
of whom were denied exit visas on grounds they knew state secrets,
have received permission to leave the Soviet Union, according to
the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   They are the largest single group to be granted visas at one
time since the summit meeting between former President Reagan and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December in New York.
   Included in the list are Aleksandr Piatetsky of Kiev, who has
waited 15 years for a visa, Mark Berenfeld of Moscow, 12 years; and
Inna Gorenshrain of Leningrad, 12 years.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the Soviet Jewry group, said in
a statement Monday: ``While we are encouraged by the resolution of
the cases of so many long-term refuseniks, we regret that many who
seek to emigrate are still denied their right to do so ....''
   Emigration from the Soviet Union last month was the highest
since October 1979.
   Knowledge of sensitive information was given frequently in the
past as a reason for denying visas to Jewish scientists or others
who had been involved in government work. One of the reforms
pledged by Gorbachev was to ease the restriction.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
emerged from talks with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
today and said he sees no need for U.N. assistance in arranging
peace in the Middle East.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, rejects the concept
of an international peace conference under U.N. auspices on the
grounds that Israel would be pressured to trade land for peace.
   ``The secretary-general expressed the general willingness and
readiness of the United Nations to help when it is asked for it,
and is ready always to do something,'' Shamir told reporters after
his 30-minute meeting with Perez de Cuellar.
   ``For the moment, there is not any necessity for it; if it will
be necessary, we will not hesitate to ask for it,'' said Shamir.
   ``I don't think that we see at this moment any special role for
the United Nations. If there would be any proposal connected with
the United Nations, we will discuss it with the
secretary-general,'' he added.
   Shamir is promoting a peace plan based on holding elections in
the Israeli-occupied territories so Palestinians could choose
representatives to negotiate with Israel over the future status of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Most Palestinians, including the Palestine Liberation
Organization, have rejected the concept of elections held under
Israeli rule, and insist on an independent Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 people evacuated when a fire
and explosions at a chemical plant sent smoke billowing over their
community were allowed back in their homes today after the fire
burned itself out.
   Two firefighters were hospitalized for treatment of headaches
and nausea after being exposed to fumes from the blaze Monday
evening at the Pacific Intermediates plant, said county Fire
Department spokeswoman Laura Kidd.
   The unincorporated community of Saticoy, about 75 miles from
downtown Los Angeles, was evacuated overnight because of possibly
toxic fumes.
   Battalion Chief Dick Perry said early today that more than 100
firefighters responded to the blaze but had to let it burn itself
out rather than risk exposure to toxic chemicals. The plant blends
chemicals for pharmacies.
   The company stocked acids, cyanide, explosive hydrogen and
corrosives, including some chemicals that react with water, Perry
said.
   ``Because of the chemicals, you can't use water on it. The fire
is burning through the roof with 75- to 100-foot flames,'' said
Denise Beaumont, another Fire Department spokeswoman.
   Firefighters hosed down an adjoining business and set up dikes
to prevent the possibly contaminated water from reaching the Santa
Clara River.
   Perry said Pacific Intermediates was cited last year for having
larger quanitities of chemicals than allowed on the premises. The
citation for violating county ordinances has yet to reach court, he
said.

   Two hundred inmates today took 12 guards
hostage at a prison west of Paris, a Justice Ministry spokesman
said.
   About 300 police _ including several companies of riot police
wearing helmuts and carrying clubs _ encircled the prison.
Negotiations were under way between the deputy director and four
inmates.
   The guards were being held in the first-floor central hall, an
area that houses about 450 prisoners serving long sentences, the
ministry spokesman said.
   The prisoners, who did not have weapons, took the guards captive
at midday, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An unidentified official in Poissy told Agence France-Presse the
inmates ``offered no coherent demands and complained of
disciplinary problems.''
   After a dispute between a guard and inmate Monday night, the
prisoners refused to resume their normal routine this morning. They
later took the guards hostage, the ministry spokesman said.
   In November 1988, 250 inmates at the prison 23 miles west of
Paris occupied the central hall for 13 hours to protest ``bad
conditions of detention'' before returning peacefully to their
cells.

   The march, organized by labor unions and women's groups,

   On April 10, 1928, the Turkish Parliament amended the

   Pro-Western Turks and authorities are worried over spreading

<TEXT>
   Foreign missions in Nepal have urged
India, which has halted most exports and transit to this landlocked
country in a border dispute, to let their diplomats have more
gasoline, diplomats said Tuesday.
   India closed most border checkpoints after Indo-Nepalese trade
and transport treaties expired March 23, effectively imposing an
economic blockage that has caused fuel, medicine and food shortages
and led to rationing.
   On Monday, news reports in Bangladesh said the move completely
shut down its nation's exports to Nepal, which were transported
through India.
   At the United Nations, about 50 Nepalese demonstrated Monday to
protest the border closings and appealed to India to reopen them.
   India closed 13 of 15 checkpoints along the 1,090-mile border
after the treaties expired. Nepal wants two new treaties, while
India demands a unified treaty combining transport and trade
agreements.
   In a statement Tuesday to Katmandu's 19 diplomatic missions, the
Foreign Office said diplomatic personnel could approach India for
supplies for their use since India's sanctions were aimed at the
Nepalese and not foreigners residing in Nepal.
   The diplomats made the request at a Friday meeting at the Indian
Embassy, said an Asian diplomat on condition of anonymity.
   One Western diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the weekly government gas ration for diplomats has been
reduced from 5.3 gallons per car immediately after March 23
closings to 4 gallons.
   Private motorists in Katmandu can buy 1.6 gallons a week, and
taxi drivers are allowed 15 liters. The rationing has led to long
queues at filling stations.
   For cooking fuel, housewives have turned increasingly to Nepal's
already dwindling forests because of a shortage of kerosene.
   ``We just get a ration of three liters (0.7 gallons) a week for
a family of seven members. Do you think it would be enough to
prepare the meals?'' asked one woman, Maya Devi Sakya.
   In Dhaka, the United News of Bangladesh news agency said more
than 20,000 tons of fertilizer sold to Nepal remains stockpiled in
Bangladesh ``for want of transit facilities through India.''
   The two neighbors have had friendly ties for years, but Nepal
has developed friendly political and economic ties with China,
which it borders along the Tibetan region. The Katmandu government
recently bought Chinese arms for its 30,000-strong military and
said they were needed to defend against domestic terrorist threats.
   India fought a bitter border war with China in 1962, and
relations still are strained.
   Nepal says it cannot play favorites in strategic politics and
needs good relations both nations. Its trade with China via Tibet
is minimal.

   A grand jury will investigate whether a former
detective committed perjury in testifying against Randall Dale
Adams, who was freed from prison after his 1977 murder conviction
was overturned, a prosecutor says.
   Adams' attorneys have accused Gus Rose of changing his version
of Adams' reaction to being arrested for the 1976 slaying of police
Officer Robert Wood.
   Assistant District Attorney Hugh Lucas said Monday the
allegation will be heard by a grand jury, probably in two or three
weeks.
   Rose, now chief deputy constable in Garland, testified in
December that Adams never denied shooting Wood and that Adams
claimied to have had a ``blackout'' about what happened.
   But Adams' attorneys countered that Rose stated in the 1988
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line'' that Adams had ``almost
overreacted his innocence.''
   ``There was no reason for him to lie on film,'' said defense
attorney George A. Preston, who asked District Attorney John Vance
for the grand jury review.
   Adams' conviction was questioned in ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which pointed instead to Adams' accuser David Ray Harris as the
killer.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last month threw out
Adams'conviction, ruling prosecutors suppressed evidence and
allowed perjury at the 1977 trial. Vance later dropped the charges,
there was not enough evidence for a retrial.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has authorized the sheriff to
seize public or private property for ``POW-style'' camps to relieve
jail overcrowding.
   District Judge Michael Schattman issued the order Monday in an
attempt to get the state to pay for housing its prisoners in county
jails.
   The state is under a federal court order to keep its prisons
below capacity and has refused to accept prisoners from most Texas
counties, leaving local jails overcrowded with inmates who have
been sentenced to state prison.
   County officials want to be reimbursed for housing such
prisoners.
   Schattman instructed Sheriff Don Carpenter to ``requisition on
the credit of the state of Texas'' any property needed for
temporary jails. Carpenter said he believes a warehouse in Fort
Worth would be a good site for a prison camp.
   The judge also instructed the sheriff to ask Gov. Bill Clements
to send National Guardsmen to patrol the compounds. If the governor
refuses, the judge authorized the sheriff to deputize as many
guards as he needs.
   The judge said the sheriff could set up ``however many POW camps
are needed'' to relieve jail overcrowding.
   Ryder Scott, general counsel to the governor, said state
officials are awaiting a copy of the ruling before deciding what
action to take.
   Officials said about 2,600 inmates are being held in the county
jail designed for 1,970 prisoners, and 1,100 of them are awaiting
transfer to state prison.
   The injunction resulted from a suit filed against the county by
former inmate Billy Wayne Markham, who claims he was raped and
beaten by other prisoners and alleged that the assaults resulted
from jail overcrowding.
   The judge ruled that the county jail is illegally overcrowded.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 7 graphs with White House comments, picking up at pvs 8th

<TEXT>
   The White House put some distance today
between President Bush and drug policy coordinator William
Bennett's criticism of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr.
and his handling of drug-related crime.
   ``We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to pick
fights,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater when asked if
Bush was ready to second Bennett's criticism.
   ``This is a very serious problem that has to be worked out with
the authorities that were elected and charged with dealing with
these problems,'' said the presidential spokesman.
   Asked if the president supports Bennett, Fitzwater replied,
``Absolutely. He supports everything Bennett says and does.''
   Barry said he welcomed the federal government's planned major
drive on drug-related crime in the capital but rejected Bennett's
contention that his administration's poor performance made the
intervention necessary.
   Bennett's plan, announced Monday, calls for construction of
pre-trial detention and prison facilities, expansion of a local law
enforcement task force, efforts to rid public housing of drug users
and dealers, expansion of drug treatment facilities and an increase
in job training programs.
   However, the D.C. government will receive no direct funding.
Instead, Bennett said, the effort's $70 million to $80 million
estimated cost will come from existing federal programs.
   ``I've said this as frankly as possible _ the local government
has not acted in as responsible a way as it should,'' Bennett said.
``The plain fact is that, for too long and in too many respects,
the D.C. government has failed to serve its citizens.''
   Barry, who is under federal investigation for his relationships
with a suspected cocaine dealer, refused to accept reporters'
questions Monday, but he went on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this
morning to defend the local anti-drug effort.
   ``The D.C. government, I think, has been vigorous. We've had
more people arrested than any other city in America _ over 12,000
people in jail, getting longer sentences,'' Barry said.
   ``I think we've got to begin to attack the social causes'' of
drug abuse, he said, noting cuts in federal education, job and
housing programs during the Reagan administration. And he said the
federal government needed to do a better job of stopping the
importation of drugs.
   ``I'm like any other mayor,'' Barry said. ``We welcome all the
help we can. We will fight as hard as we can ... We're going to win
this war.''
   Washington became the nation's per capita murder capital last
year with 372 slayings, most of them drug-related. This year, there
have been 135 homicides, compared with 87 at the same time last
year.
   Barry had said Monday he was grateful for extra federal help in
the drug war, but abruptly left a news conference before reporters
could ask him if he had been stung by Bennett's comments.
   ``We welcome the idea of Washington being a model (in the war on
drugs),'' Barry said. ``We look forward to a long working
relationship.''
   ``We don't feel that the city has failed in its management in
this area,'' said city administrator Carol Thompson, who fielded
questions after the mayor's sudden departure.
   Rick Blake, a Barry spokesman, said the mayor had staff meetings
to attend and could not wait for the completion of the press
conference.
   Barry said he had discussed the plans at length with Bennett,
but Bennett played down the mayor's involvement.
   ``I briefed Mayor Barry today by telephone,'' Bennett said. ``I
gave him a brief outline of the whole thing, and we chatted for a
few minutes.''
   Bennett refused to elaborate on Barry's role, but congressional
and district government sources said Bennett had frozen the mayor
out of his deliberations.
   ``There are normal channels you go through _ and that's Barry _
but Bennett was going directly to agency heads,'' said one District
government source who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``We were told that they were not dealing with Barry,'' added a
congressional source who had been briefed on the plan by Bennett's
assistants. ``They said the only person who had any credibility in
this administration was (Police Chief Maurice T.) Turner.''
   Barry, who has been questioned by a federal grand jury about his
ties to accused crack cocaine dealer and former city employee
Charles Lewis, is under fire from Democrats and Republicans alike
on Capitol Hill. Senate Democrats criticized Barry for his lack of
coordinated plans for fighting the crime problem, while Rep. Stan
Parris, R-Va., has introduced legislation to give the federal
government control of the city's public safety system.
   Bennett's effort includes housing 250 city inmates at federal
prisons, construction of a 500-bed pre-trial detention facility
within one year and construction of a new 700-bed federal prison
for the Washington-Baltimore area within two years.
   Bennett faulted the District government for failing to construct
the detention facility in the three years since Cogress
appropriated money for it, saying that due to the lack of space,
``thousands of people arrested for drug and other serious crimes in
this city regularly go free.''
   Meanwhile, a Washington-area drug task force will get an
additional 57 investigators under the plan, including 25 FBI agents
and 11 Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
   Five Defense Department intelligence analysts also will be
assigned to the task force, which will concentrate on identifying
crack distributors.
   On Mrch 13, the day he was sworn into office, Bennett had said
he viewed Washington as a ``test case'' to determine what federal
efforts will work as he compiles a national drug control strategy.
That plan is due 180 days after he took over the job.
   Barry's ties to Lewis were called into question in December,
when undercover police on their way to Lewis' hotel room to make a
drug buy were abruptly called back when it was learned that the
mayor was in the room with the suspect. Barry has declined to
discuss his dealings with Lewis, but has repeatedly denied using
drugs.
   Lewis subsequently was arrested in early March in the Virgin
Islands, where he is charged with selling crack cocaine to
undercover agents.

<TEXT>
   Museum security workers turned away busloads of
visitors from the Pompidou art center Tuesday for the 13th day,
demanding Paris' most popular tourist attraction provide more jobs,
higher wages and better benefits.
   About 1,200 employees working in other departments of the
multifaceted center went on a 24-hour strike today in solidarity
with the security workers.
   Helene Ahrweiler, the center's new director, said their demands
are ``trifling matters.'' She was more concerned about cutting
costs, and said she is canceling a $1 million Andy Warhol
retrospective.
   Defiant guards turned away thousands of European tourists on
spring vacations who flooded the city.
   ``You can't come in. Can't you read the signs? We're on
strike,'' said one guard at the 12-year-old center.
   The Georges Pompidou center tops the Eiffel Tower as the
capital's most popular attraction.
   Mrs. Ahrweiler said she wants to find a global solution to
personnel problems.
   ``I'm the president of the whole center, and I want to avoid the
isolation of the various departments,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   She was to meet today with Culture Minister Jack Lang to discuss
``the status, career development and salary policies of all museum
workers.''
   The center, built in 1977 to accommodate 5,000 visitors a day,
now welcomes five times that number.
   Mrs. Ahrweiler said she would make changes in management and
cancel shows to cut costs.
   ``We can make substantial savings,'' she said. ``I'm stopping
the Andy Warhol retrospective.''
   The restrospective, organized by and now displayed at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, was to run in 1990 and cost the Pompidou
Center nearly $1 million.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters went to the polls today with Mayor Tom
Bradley so heavily favored for an unprecedented fifth term that
turnout was expected to hit an all-time low.
   Bradley, 71, needed to capture at least 50 percent of the votes
against nine opponents to avoid a June 6 runoff for the four-year
office. None of the candidates runs on a party line.
   The only serious challenger, freshman City Councilman Nate
Holden, has accused Bradley of ignoring his roots and the city's
impoverished south side and favoring big business and foreign trade.
   ``He's been in office too long,'' said Holden, who like Bradley
is black. ``They're not going to vote for him out of habit
anymore.''
   On Monday, City Clerk Lee Lee Martinez predicted turnout of 25
percent to 30 percent _ ``a historical low for a mayoral election.''
   Turnout figures were not immediately available this morning.
   But Bradley, the son of sharecroppers and grandson of slaves,
has managed to escape responsibility for many of the city's
problems, including drugs and gangs.
   Even a current investigation of Bradley by the city attorney's
office for performing consulting work with two banks that do
business with the city seemed to have had little effect on the
mayor. Bradley has returned the $18,000 fees he was paid and called
the charges politically motivated.
   Pollsters and would-be candidates conclude that Bradley, a
congenial former city police lieutenant and councilman, has managed
to be associated with Los Angeles' emergence as a Pacific Rim
economic power and growth as a multi-ethnic cultural center.
   The city's population is swelling past 3 million, making it the
nation's second-largest, and more than 70 languages are spoken.
   Bradley's name has been carefully linked to projects such as the
profitable 1984 Summer Olympics, the development of a skyscraper
skyline downtown, the revamping of Los Angeles International
Airport, where the international terminal bears his name, and the
construction of a multibillion-dollar rail-line transit system,
Metro Rail.
   His stewardship has been less linked in the public mind with
criminal infestation, illegal drug trafficking, street congestion,
overbuilding, pollution and a failing sewage system.
   In a recent Los Angeles Times poll, 65 percent surveyed said
their quality of life worsened during the Bradley years to the
point that half have recently considered moving.
   However, in another Times' poll, 78 percent of Hispanics, 70
percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable
impression of the Democratic mayor.
   ``They (the public) are not holding him accountable for it. The
drugs and the gangs are causing it. But they don't think Tom
Bradley is causing it. He's a lucky politician,'' said Joe Cerrell,
a Los Angeles-based political consultant who has known Bradley
since he was a police lieutenant in the 1950s.
   Arnold Steinberg, a political pollster and consultant, said a
docile media and a perception that the city's problems are so huge
that they appear unsolvable add to Bradley's aura of immunity.
   The other mayoral hopefuls were socialist Joel Britton, an oil
refinery worker; singer-dancer Eileen Anderson; teachers Raul Reyes
and Maria Elizabeth Munoz; consultant Khushro Ghandhi; aerospace
worker Stewart Alexander; politician Leonard Earl Miropol and
political scientist Gary Passi.
   Other Los Angeles races included eight of the city council's 15
seats, city attorney, controller and school board members.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan will
meet with President Bush during a two-day visit to Washington in
June, the White House said today.
   The official visit by the first woman leader of a Moslem country
will be June 6 and 7, said Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. During
the trip she will be honored at a White House dinner.
   The president welcomes her trip as a chance to ``demonstrate our
support for the free elections which recently returned democratic
government to Pakistan,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``The visit should offer an opportunity to further strengthen
the friendship and close cooperation between our two nations in the
wake of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and other important
developments in the region.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was elected Nov. 17 when her populist party
defeated the right wing in the country's first free election since
a coup ousted her father 11 years earlier.
   Her party also captured 92 seats in the 237-member assembly, by
far the most of any party.
   During the recent international fracas over Salman Rushdie's
book ``Satanic Verses,'' Ms. Bhutto was embroiled in the
controversy between Western nations and her country's neighbor
Iran, whose leaders called for the death of Rushdie because of the
book's alleged blasphemous passages.
   She declined to endorse the death threat but said Moslems should
have the right to protest against blasphemy.

   A man who was arrested on drug charges got an
unwelcome phone call on his beeper at the police station, where
officers returned the call and found a prospective drug buyer on
the other end.
   Michael Williams, 26, told authorities he used the beeper in his
car-wash business and ``because I've got a lot of girlfriends and a
lot of friends.''
   Wayne County Circuit Judge Michael Talbot ruled Monday that
$4,297 found on Williams must be forfeited to police because it
came from a drug sale. Williams had said the money came from his
car-wash business.
   Authorities also found less than a gram of cocaine on Williams
when they arrested him Nov. 11, 1988. He faces a misdemeanor drug
trial in Dearborn Heights District Court.
   The person who called asking to buy drugs got suspicious and
hung up after officers tried to arrange a time and place for the
deal, said Sgt. Jim Schwall. The person's identity was never
discovered.

   Runaway Everglades brushfires sent thick black
smoke across the Miami area today, prompting health warnings and an
order to evacuate 700 aliens from a detention camp.
   ``I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so
heavy,'' said Anna Nasher, who lives in suburban Coral Gables.
   The National Weather Service advised people with asthma,
emphysema or other respiratory problems to stay indoors.
   ``It's very serious. We've got an emergency,'' said Perry
Rivkind, district director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Rivkind this morning ordered the evacuation of aliens from the
Krome Avenue Detention Center on the edge of the Everglades as a
brushfire advanced to within a mile. But by early afternoon, the
aliens were still awaiting buses.
   Rivkind said the immigrants would be taken to the Bobby Maduro
Baseball Stadium, which recently was used as a home for Nicaraguan
refugees. But City Manager Cesar Odio suggested they might be
transferred to a facility in Texas.
   Smoke from fires some 20 miles away, including 3,000 burning
acres of dried-out sawgrass, blocked the subtropical sun and slowed
traffic.
   ``This smoke has reached at or close to the ground in many areas
and has reduced visibilities,'' the weather service said in a
statement.
   Forecasters said the thick smoke would hang over the area until
an evening sea breeze blew it back into the Everglades.

<TEXT>
   Larry Marsman and Harold Christiansen live
half a world apart, but Christiansen has given the younger man a
link to the father he never knew, an aviator shot down over
Indonesia in World War II.
   Christiansen had carried a wedding band belonging to Robert
Marsman, an aviator in the Dutch Royal Navy, since the ring was
given to him by natives on an Indonesian island in 1945.
   ``I kept that ring all these years thinking that some day,
somewhere we would find Marsman's widow,'' Christiansen said in a
telephone interview from his home in New South Wales, Australia.
``All we had to go on was the name `Dorothy' that was on the inside
of the ring.''
   With the help of members of Marsman's old 18th Squadron and a
lot of luck, Christiansen finally made contact with the family in
Brandon in 1987. The retired major mailed the ring to the Marsman
family and later traveled to Mississippi to visit the flier's widow
and son.
   ``Completing this has been one of the highlights of my life,''
said Christiansen.
   ``There's no way to tell you what this has meant to me,''
Marsman said. ``I was two weeks old when his Mitchell bomber went
down and all I knew from childhood was that he was missing in
action and that's all my mother ever knew.''
   Christiansen said his unit was assigned to sweep through Kai
Island in search of lingering Japanese or Australian and Dutch
soldiers.
   ``I was given the ring by the head man of the island, who told
me about this flier whose body had washed up on the beach,''
Christiansen said.
   ``The head man asked that I find `Dorothy,' the name enscribed
on the ring,'' and told him that name tags showed the flier's name
was Robert Marsman, Christiansen said.
   At the end of the war, the Dutch government did not yet have
complete records and ``nobody I contacted seemed to know about
Dutchmen flying into those islands. It was not until three or four
years ago that I was able to get on the trail,'' Christiansen said.
   He spotted the name Robert Marsman in a book written by Gordon
Wallace and detailing the history of the 18th Squadron, and wrote
Wallace asking help.
   Wallace contacted Dutch officials who were able to search their
completed files and learned Dorothy's maiden name and that she
lived in Mississippi.
   The elder Marsman, whose parents were in the Dutch East Indies
and were captured by the Japanese, joined the Dutch Royal Navy and
was sent to Mississippi to learn to fly B-25.
   At Jackson, Robert Marsman and 16-year-old Dorothy Jean Usry of
Brandon met, fell in love and married.
   ``It is a good feeling to know that this is finally settled,''
said Dorothy Baker, who later remarried and lives in Jackson.
``Seeing that ring was a real surprise, a shock. All I ever knew
was the fact that his plane had exploded in mid-air over those
islands.''
   The family is trying to get Marsman's remains, buried in a war
cemetery in Indonesia, returned to Mississippi and buried in a
small cemetery for Dutch pilots who died in training.
   ``He wanted to be buried back here if anything happened to
him,'' said Mrs. Baker. ``And it would mean a lot for Larry.''
   However, efforts to secure help from the American and Dutch
governments to exhume the body haven't been successful so far.
   ``The United States trained him and he fought for freedom,''
Larry Marsman said. ``He wanted to be buried here because he felt
his family was here. I know this sounds silly, but I think that's
why this ring has worked its way back through all these years. He's
telling me to do something and I pray that I can.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has
praised Sarasota for its support of a family driven from their
hometown in an adjacent county because three brothers were exposed
to the AIDS virus.
   Koop on Monday presented the city a certificate praising its
hospitality toward the Ray family, who settled here last year after
battling town officals over an order banning the sons' attendance
at public schools in Arcadia.
   Ricky, 12, Robert, 11, and Randy Ray, 9, are hemophiliacs who
doctors suspect became exposed to the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated blood products.
   The Ray boys, doctors say, show no symptoms of AIDS and pose no
threat to other children in a casual school environment.
   The boys and their parents, Louise and Clifford Ray, fled
Arcadia in 1987 when their home burned down, months after the
family won a federal court order returning their sons to school
despite protest of other parents.
   The preceding school year, school officials banned the three
youngsters from attending classes because they tested positive for
the AIDS virus. The family later received a $1.1 million settlement
from the school district.
   The family settled in Sarasota in September, and have attended
school since without incident.
   ``Sarasota has demonstrated that it's one of those good
communities that does react to families in need ... and comes to
their calling and provides opportunities for them,'' Koop told an
audience of about 400 people.

<HEAD>Maryland Legislature Enacts Waiting Period For Assault Gun Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers have passed a requirement for a
seven-day waiting period and criminal background checks for buyers
of assault weapons.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer is expected to sign the bill,
passed late Monday in the closing hours of the 1989 General
Assembly session.
   Under the measure, State Police would check the background of a
prospective gun buyer for evidence the individual was a drug
addict, alcoholic, convicted felon or was mentally deranged. An
individual with such a background can be denied a gun.
   Purchases of 24 semiautomatic handguns and rifles are affected.
   Earlier in the 90-day session, legislators considered banning
the sale of semiautomatics altogether.
   Last year, Maryland banned cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
   Lawmakers have been continued pressure from the National Rifle
Association, which is worried the state is stepping on citizens'
rights to own guns.
   Lawmakers around the nation turned their attention to
semiautomatic weapons after a drifter opened fire on a Stockton,
Calif., schoolyard in January with an AK-47 rifle and killed five
children before committing suicide.

   Anxious parents pulled 10 to 20 children
out of classes after a drawing of an assault rifle and the words
``You're Dead'' were found on a school that received telephone
death threats 10 days earlier.
   Police said the graffiti found Monday appeared to be the work of
juveniles and not of the anonymous woman who made the phone threats.
   But officials of this rural community's school system reinstated
tight security imposed after the first threats, including locked
doors and police escorts for morning and afternoon bus runs.
   The security was a drastic change at the Brooklyn School, which
had an open-door policy at its three buildings serving 850 pupils
in kindergarten through ninth grade.
   ``We have to face the fact it's probably not wise to have such
freedoms,'' said schools Superintendent Louise Berry. ``It's sad.
It's really an end of an era.''
   She said officials would also look into different types of
security, including intercoms at doorways.
   ``If your child forgot a book, it used to be you could walk
right in and hand it to him,'' said Mary Beth Leonard, who came to
pick up her 11-year-old son Monday.
   Nearly a third of all pupils were kept home April 3, but the
rate of absenteeism dropped to about 15 percent the following day
and returned to normal by the end of last week. The usual rate is 5
percent to 7 percent, Berry said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States urged skeptical Arab
governments on Tuesday to withhold judgment on an Israeli proposal
for Palestinian elections until it is developed into a more formal
plan.
   ``This is a step-by-step process,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said. ``You have to crawl before you walk.''
   President Bush endorsed the proposal last week when Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir presented it to him at the White
House. Subsequently, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
Arab League rejected it outright.
   The Bush administration declined to take that as a final answer.
   ``It is not unusual in a process for different parties to stake
out more extreme positions, especially at the beginning of the
process,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The U.S. official said Shamir's proposal had ``potential'' and
``there are lots of questions to explore. We plan to do so in the
days and weeks ahead.''
   For instance, Ms. Tutwiler said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III would discuss the proposal with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze during a visit to Moscow May 10-11.
   ``We are asking all those who are committed to peace to give us
a chance to explore and develop these ideas,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Shamir's proposal is to hold elections among the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control on the West Bank
and in Gaza. The leaders they chose would negotiate arrangements
for five years of local self-rule.
   Afterward, Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt would
negotiate an overall settlement for the territories the Arabs lost
in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League representative here, denounced
the Israeli proposal on Monday as a device ``to buy more time for
Israel and to diffuse the mounting pressure within the United
States and throughout the world as well to thwart the Palestinian
uprising.''
   Maksoud said Shamir sought to find through elections ``a
boneless or a toothless Palestinian negotiator who ratifies his
conquest.''

<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania House has voted to have
a state song, ``Pennsylvania,'' which would make the Keystone state
the 49th state to have an official tune. Only New Jersey would be
left songless.
   The House voted 135-59 for the measure Monday, sending it on to
the Senate.
   Efforts to put one special song on the books have for years been
tangled in politics as lawmakers pushed constituents' creations.
   State Government Chairman Frank Oliver said a special committee
of music educators and professionals chose ``Pennsylvania'' from
more than 200 selections. The process left no room for politics, he
said.
   The song features the chorus, ``Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, may
your future be filled with honor everlasting as your history.''
   The two-verse ditty was written about 20 years ago by Eddie
Khoury and Ronnie Bonner. ``I feel great, I feel greatly honored.
What can I say?'' Khoury, a retired prison administrator, said in a
telephone interview.
   Under the legislation, Khoury and Bonner would still hold the
copyright to the song as its publishers. But the state ``can use
the song in any manner it sees fit,'' Khoury said.
   During debate, one lawmaker bellowed out a song he wrote about
three years ago lamenting Pennsylvania's song-less state.
   State Rep. James Gallen launched into the nameless song a
cappella to the cheers and applause of his fellow House members.
``Without a song, there's no way to celebrate,'' he sang in a
slightly off-key baritone.
   ``Without a song Pennsylvania is out of tune. Without a song,
we're the off-key stone state. We've got a state dog, flower and
fish and even a state bug.
   ``But what good is our bug, if we are unable in song it to
plug.''
   State Rep. Gerard Kosinski said he would oppose the bill for
``Pennsylvania.''
   ``In my mind, the only state song is the `Pennsylvania Polka,'
'' he said.

   Tiffany Marie has been abducted, all
900 easy-going pounds of her, leaving her owners distraught and
police hamstrung.
   ``We want her back,'' owner Bob Urbanski said. ``We'll pay a
ransom. No questions asked.''
   He said Tuesday that the 2-year-old sow disappeared Sunday night
from the post where she was tied in an unfenced yard behind the
family-run pet store in this south Chicago suburb.
   Tiffany Marie is white with small brown spots. She's partial to
corn chips and strawberry whipped cream pie but will eat just about
anything except pickles and sour grapes.
   ``She's so gentle and just grunts at us when we're around,''
said Barbara Urbanski, who runs the pet shop with her husband and
children, Debbie and Bob. ``She's housebroken and part of the
family.''
   She's also part of the community. Tiffany Marie has become a
minor celebrity, featured in articles and seen on television while
she waded in her little pool or ducked the sun beneath her beach
umbrella in front of the store.
   Police were notified, but Chief Steven Rhoads said it will be
tough cracking the case. There was no ransom note but there have
been crank calls.
   The Urbanskis fear the crooks might try to sell the animal. Hog
prices Friday were listed at $37.50 per hundredweight. But Debbie
Urbanski noted that a diet of people food had spoiled the pig's
future as pork.
   ``She weighs 900 pounds, but that's probably all fat,'' she
said. ``Tiffany does not eat pig food. She eats what we do and
people come by and leave things for her to eat. Prime ribs,
doughnuts, cookies, White Castle hamburgers, anything.''
   The pig disappeared once before, wandering after her feed bucket
when a gust of wind carried it off. ``We found her half a block
away at a Dairy Queen, where people were feeding her ice cream,''
Urbanski said.

<HEAD>150,000 Refugees from Beirut in South Lebanon ^With AM-Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The horror of the fighting in Beirut has
sent 150,000 city residents fleeing for shelter in war-ravaged
south Lebanon.
   Many moved in with relatives. But hundreds are living in the
wilderness, sleeping in their cars, in orange groves, or on the
rough concrete gravel in unfinished buildings.
   A nine-month-pregnant woman is staying with her three children
and 45 other refugees at one of the incomplete structures. They
sleep on the ground without mattresses or blankets.
   ``I need milk to feed my children, and to give to my baby who is
due any minute now,'' said Alliyeh Khodor, 24. She fled her house
in southern Beirut on March 14, a week after the latest round of
fighting erupted between Christian and allied Syrian and Druse
forces around the capital.
   Police say at least 180 have been killed and more than 600
injured the fighting.
   U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon and the
International Committee of the Red Cross are trying to ease
refugees' plight with food handouts and blankets.
   ``So far we have been able to provide wheat, sugar, canned food
and blankets,'' said a Red Cross spokesman who refused to be
identified by name. ``But our stocks are running thin.''
   The influx has boosted the population of south Lebanon by 30
percent, causing acute food and gas shortages, said a police
spokesman who by custom is not identified by name.
   Spokesmen for the U.N. force said at least 45,000 migrants are
staying in the U.N. area of operations. The rest of the refugees,
which they estimate at 150,000, have fled to areas near the
southern Lebanese port cities of Sidon and Tyre.
   Some are trying to get back to their original homes inside
Israel's self-designated ``security zone,'' along the
Israel-Lebanon border which they fled during Israel's 1982 invasion.
   But Israeli military authorities and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army of right-wing Christian fighters that controls the
zone are refusing to allow Moslem returnees.
   Ghazi Fadlallah, a 45-year-old taxi driver, said he has been
prevented from returning to the house he left nearly nine years ago
in the town of Aynata inside the Israeli-run enclave.
   ``I have since changed nine houses because they were either
destroyed or burned to the ground during Lebanon's endless wars,''
Fadlallah said.
   His wife and eight children squeeze with 27 other relatives into
his brother-in-law's two-room house in Hosh village, two miles
south of Tyre.
   His eldest son, Mohammad, 15, said shrapnel almost killed him
two weeks ago when a bomb crashed near the south Beirut tailoring
shop where he worked.
   Most refugees are Shiite Moslems from south Lebanon who fled the
Israeli invasions of 1978 and 1982 and bloody clashes between
feuding Shiite militias.
   Lines of people wait outside the state's central telephone
station in Tyre to call relatives left behind in the capital. The
station has only two functioning lines.
   ``Now it's Beirut. The hell there is unbearable. So I've come
back here,'' said Kamleh Sabbagh, 42. ``But my heart is still
there.''
   Malak Kabbani, 45, a Sunni Moslem waiting her turn, said she
left her house in west Beirut's Mosseitbeh district mainly because
water and power were cut off.
   ``We are used to the shelling, it does not scare us anymore.
It's much more difficult without electricity and water,'' she said.
   Yohanna Haddad, the Roman Catholic bishop of Tyre, said only
1,500 Christians are among refugees in Tyre.
   But police say tens of thousands of other Christians have fled
the Christian-held regions north and northeast of Beirut.
   Police say most managed to leave by small boats to open waters,
where a ship took them to the southernmost border town of Naqoura.
From there they crossed on foot to the ``security zone.''

   NBC weatherman Willard Scott, saying his
rift with ``Today'' show colleague Bryant Gumbel is behind him, has
commemorated the lesson he learned by establishing a Common Sense
Scholarship at a college.
   ``I was trying to find a way, some way, that I could show a
little bit of my regret for keeping a little feud that is so stupid
going,'' Scott told a crowd of about 2,000 on Monday at Mississippi
College, a Baptist school in Clinton, Miss. ``It's a feud that
should never have gone more than two days at the most.''
   Scott donated his speaking fee of about $12,000 to start the
scholarship, and said he would contribute for the next two years to
benefit a Mississippian ``who needs assistance, someone who has
displayed some simple act of common sense.''
   He then went on to Knoxville, where he again apologized for the
feud during an appearance at the city's annual Dogwood Arts
Festival.
   ``It was unfortunate. I talked too much and I am going to keep
my mouth closed,'' he said.
   On March 1, it was reported that Gumbel sent a confidential memo
to the ``Today'' producer, complaining that Scott ``holds the show
hostage'' with his ``bad taste.'' At the time, Scott threatened to
quit.

   Customs officials seized entertainer
Liza Minnelli's dog, charging she brought it into Sweden illegally.
   Minnelli was forced to send her cairn terrier, Lilly, to Paris
early Tuesday, while she stayed on to perform, said Customs
Inspector Stig Thelberg.
   Minnelli, on a world tour with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis
Jr., was reported to be distressed.
   ``Liza is guilty of smuggling and the case will be taken to
court as in all other cases where someone tries to smuggle animals
to Sweden,'' Thelberg told The Associated Press.
   Minnelli brought her dog with her on a bus in which she traveled
from the Netherlands.
   Her hotel said she was not available for comment. But Minnelli's
press agent in New York, Allen Eichhorn, said ``that dog has been
all over Europe and all over the world. If officials hadn't
informed her or they didn't know in advance, who's to suspect it's
illegal.''
   Swedish laws require dogs be put in quarantine for four months
to guard against rabies.

   A Broadway-bound revival of ``Gypsy''
starring Emmy-winning actress Tyne Daly will debut in May in a
newly refurbished theater, the theater manager said.
   The 30-member cast will rehearse for two weeks, then perform for
five days before starting a 14-city national tour on its way to a
Broadway opening in November, David Johnson, manager of the Tivoli
Theater, said Monday.
   ``Gypsy'' is a revival of the 1959 Broadway musical about
stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Ms. Daly is best known for her role as
policewoman Mary Beth Lacey on the television series ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey,'' which won her four Emmy awards.
   The ornate theater, which seats 1,762, featured gold-plated
electrical fixtures, the largest pipe organ east of St. Louis, a
silk curtain and a ceiling hand-painted in China when it opened in
1921.

   Johns Hopkins University trustees have honored
an arms reduction negotiator by renaming the international studies
school The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.
   Dean George R. Packard said the vote Monday was not sought by
Nitze, a co-founder of the school in 1943. The school, located in
Washington, is a graduate school of international affairs
affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute,
conceived in 1957 by Nitze.
   ``It is our way of expressing our thanks and respect to a man
who has made so much of the history which our students are
currently studying and who is always available to our faculty and
students for dialogue and consultation,'' Packard said.
   Nitze, 81, headed arms negotiating teams from 1981 to 1984 and
for the past five years was an arms negotiations adviser to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.

<HEAD>Leavenworth Escapee Captured With Large Amount of Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison escapee and suspected bank
robber who underwent plastic surgery to look like actor Robert De
Niro was captured Tuesday with a large amount of cash in Florida,
federal officials said.
   Robert Litchfield, 40, was grabbed by agents of the U.S.
Marshals Service, which had assigned a special task force to him
after he escaped last month from the U.S. Penitentiary at
Leavenworth, Kan.
   ``It appears he is a creature of habit. There was no doubt he
was going back to bank robbing and he would go back to a hot part
of the country,'' said Kent Pekarek, the U.S. marshal for Kansas.
   The marshal said Litchfield had black, puffy eyes, ``which
indicated he had just received plastic surgery of his eyes and ears
to alter his original appearance.''
   ``Robert De Niro is his idol. ... He said he altered his
appearance so he would look like Robert De Niro,'' Pekarek said.
   When he was arrested, in Pensacola Beach, Fla., he carried
papers identifying him as a lawyer and a probation officer. A
weapon was found in a vehicle he had purchased, Pekarek said, but
it turned out to be a pellet gun.
   Litchfield, the first escapee from Leavenworth in a dozen years,
passed himself off as an employee and walked out the front door of
the prison to a waiting cab March 10. He was allegedly spotted in
various parts of the Kansas City area for a few days before he
dropped from sight.
   Litchfield was serving time for bank robberies in Florida.
Pekarek said he has a criminal record dating to a 1969 burglary
conviction in Colorado Springs, and that he had other convictions
in Clayton, Mo., Texarkana, Texas, and in Pennsylvania and Florida.
   Pekarek said Litchfield is a suspect in the March 24 holdup of
Georgia Federal Bank in Tucker, Ga., where a man posing as a
utility worker investigating a gas leak fled with about $38,000 in
cash.
   When Litchfield was arrested Tuesday, he was carrying a
briefcase containing what Pekarek characterized only as ``a large
sum of of money'' and had about $2,500 in his pockets.
   Pekarek said members of the task force were sent to Florida
shortly after the Georgia robbery. ``About two days ago we
developed a lead I can't talk about that indicated he was in the
Alabama-Florida area ... using the name Michael Wilson and that he
had leased a condominium in Pensacola Beach.''
   Agents were sent to the building early Tuesday and kept it under
surveillance until Litchfield got off an elevator, Pekarek said.

   The walled Old City, dotted with shrines sacred
to Moslems, Jews and Christians, is the major fault line of the
Arab-Israeli conflict where tensions frequently burst to the
surface.
   On Tuesday, Palestinians buried an Arab resident of the Old
City's Moslem quarter who was shot by an Israeli dressed in army
fatigues. The angry Palestinians shouted: ``Teach the Jews a
lesson! Everything Jewish in this town should be burned!''
   ``We are living inside a powder keg,'' said Mohammed Sublaban,
40, the owner of a souvenir shop in the city's Moslem quarter.
``The slightest provocation can make all the resentments erupt to
the surface.''
   Responsibility for the submachine gun attack Monday was claimed
by a Jewish extremist group known as the Sicarites. The group,
which takes its name from ancient Jewish assassins of biblical
times, said it was avenging Palestinian stoning attacks on Jews.
   Tension in the Old City rose Friday when rocks hurled by
Palestinian rioters during a clash in the Al Aqsa mosque compound
fell on Jews worshipping at the adjacent Wailing Wall, the holiest
site in Judaism.
   ``Radicalism on both the Arab and Jewish sides have sharpened
the situation,'' Police Minister Chaim Bar Lev said on Israel
radio. ``Arabs throw rocks at the Temple Mount and a Jew kills
Arabs. There is no solution, it only heats up the conflict.''
   About 17,000 Moslems and 2,000 Jews live in separate enclaves
inside ancient Jerusalem's crowded square mile of narrow
cobblestone alleyways, houses and shops. Enemies yet neighbors,
they carry separate passports and rarely interact.
   ``These people will never integrate, it is not their purpose,''
Mayor Teddy Kollek said recently to explain the historic divisions.
``The most we can do is try to avoid clashes of interests.''
   Clashes have, however, been a hallmark of Jerusalem's history.
   The city has been conquered about 20 times from 587 B.C., when
the Babylonians exiled the Jews, to 1967 when Israel captured Arab
east Jerusalem and the walled Old City from Jordan and annexed it.
   In addition to the Jewish shrines, Moslems also have sacred
places in the Holy City, including Al Aqsa Mosque. The mosque is in
the Haram al Sharif, or Noble Enclossure, an area is called Temple
Mount by the Jews.
   Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the Palestinians also
claim Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.
   For Christians, the Old City is a goal of pilgrims as the scene
of Christ's crucifixion and burial.
   Friday's riot at the Al Aqsa mosque compound prompted Bar Lev to
ban some Palestinians from the occupied territories from worshiping
there.
   The move elicited angry reactions from the Waqf, the Islamic
administrators of the Haram al Sharif, or Noble Sancutary in
Arabic. It is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and
Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   ``This is categorically unacceptable. It is an attack against
freedom of religion,'' said Sheik Mohammed Jamal. ``Bar Lev is
pouring oil on the fire. The result will only be more and more
fire.''

<HEAD>Government Calls Winter Wheat's Condition ``Mostly Fair''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter wheat across the nation is in ``mostly
fair'' condition, although the crop has declined in the central
Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest, a government report said
Tuesday.
   ``In Kansas, winter wheat condition deteriorated and was mostly
very poor to poor,'' the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said.
``As fields broke dormancy, winterkill continued to become more
evident. Insect and disease problems, however, were below normal.''
   The facility, operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, said the Oklahoma crop was mostly good to fair, and in
Texas winter wheat was reported in mostly fair to poor condition.
   Conditions were reported as of the week of April 3-9. Dry soils
since winter wheat was planted last fall have stunted development
severely in many areas.
   Elsewhere in the plains region, winter wheat in Nebraska was
said to be in mostly fair condition, although winterkill became
evident as the dormant crop began to green up this spring.
   The crop was reported mostly good to fair in Idaho and South
Dakota, and mostly fair to good in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming.
   In Oregon, winter wheat was mostly fair to good, with some
replanting in the Columbia Basin. The Washington crop was mostly
poor, with winterkill becoming more widespread in several counties.
   Winter wheat was said to be in mostly good to excellent
condition in California, and mostly good in the Corn Belt. In the
Delta and Southeast, the crop was reported in mostly good to fair
condition.

   The annual report of Southwest Airlines Co.
contains something that could raise a flap, or at least a couple
wings _ a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics, said Tim McClure, executive creative director of Austin
advertising agency GSD&amp;M, which designed the 1988 report.
   ``And we translated that to what we thought was the most basic
of all airplanes, the paper airplane.''
   The booklet, besides reporting on the regional airline's record
$57.95 million in profit, traces the construction of a paper
airplane from the first folding of the paper to the final painting
to resemble Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out
last year during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks
in Texas and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's a punch-out version of the plane, with
assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint'':
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''

   Voters may be able to find neither rhyme
nor reason in the workings of state government, but the governor
hopes to change that. Louisiana is looking for a poet laureate.
   ``We are looking for someone like a (Carl) Sandburg, a T.S.
Eliot or a Robert Frost,'' Ray Beasley of the Department of
Culture, Recreation and Tourism said Monday.
   The state Arts Council is looking for a poet to serve as the
state's chief balladeer, extolling the virtues of Louisiana and the
state's ``literary excellence and understanding of the literary
arts,'' Beasley said.
   The position was created in 1942, but Louisiana has not had a
poet laureate since Jean M. Boese of Alexandria left office along
with Gov. Edwin Edwards in 1988.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer will name the poet after receiving
recommendations from the arts panel.

<HEAD>Agency Says Warped Track Caused Derailment, Blames Rail Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed
``inadequate track inspection and maintenance procedures'' by the
Burlington Northern Railroad for the derailment last summer of an
Amtrak passenger train in Montana.
   The train, which was bound from Chicago to Seattle, derailed
Aug. 5 near Saco, Mon., when it struck track that had been warped
by temperatures near 100 degrees. The accident injured 165 people,
about a dozen of them seriously.
   The National Transportation Safety Board in its report on the
accident said Tuesday it was caused by shifting of track just ahead
of the Amtrak train. The board said the shifting was caused by the
intense heat, but that track conditions and the danger of such
buckling should have been apparent to Burlington Northern.
   The probable cause of the accident, said the safety board in its
final report, ``was Burlington Northern's inadequate track
inspection and maintenance procedures which resulted in a thermally
induced lateral shift of the track structure in front of (the)
Amtrak train.''
   The board continued that ``the lateral shift occurred when the
train was closer than the 2,478 feet necessary'' to bring the train
to a safe stop. The train was traveling at an authorized speed of
79 miles an hour.
   ``There was nothing that the engine crew could have done ... to
have avoided or decreased the severity of the accident after they
observed the shifted track,'' said the report.
   The derailment caused five of the train's cars to topple after
leaving the tracks. The 12-car train was carrying 375 passengers
and about a dozen crewmembers.
   The safety board blamed some of the injuries on ``the lack of
effective restraint devices'' that caused some items to fly around
inside the cars. While the board did not fault Amtrak for the
accident, the report called on the passenger railroad to improve
its training and procedures for evacuating passengers in such
circumstances.
   The safety board also called on Burlington Northern to improve
its track inspection procedures and make available to inspectors
devices that could determine when excessive heat might cause track
to warp.

<TEXT>
   A fire aboard a tugboat early today
briefly halted the Columbia River barge trip of a mammoth
decommissioned nuclear reactor bound for its burial site, the U.S.
Coast Guard said.
   The fire broke out in the tug's engine room about 3:30 a.m.,
when the barge carrying the reactor was just above Bonneville Dam,
and delayed the trip for about seven hours.
   There were no injuries and ``at no time was there any danger of
the reactor vessel going aground,'' said Wenday Anderson of the
Knapptown Corp. in Portland, which owns the tug.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Guy Nolan said a backup tug was hooked up
to the barge carrying the reactor while a third tug was dispatched
from Portland.
   Nolan said he was unsure what caused the fire aboard the
Clarkston.
   Coast Guard vessels escorted the barge as it made its way
upriver toward a dump at the government's Hanford nuclear
reservation in Washington.
   About 50 demonstrators watched from the Interstate Bridge at the
edge of Portland as the barge passed by without incident just after
midnight, said Petty Officer David Clarke.
   The barge headed to the Hood River for the final leg of an
8,000-mile trip from Shippingport, Pa., through the Panama Canal
and up the Pacific coast.
   The Shippingport nuclear plant was shut down in 1982 and
dismantled. The barge carried its 1,000-ton reactor pressure vessel.
   The vessel, 45 feet high and 18 feet across, was emptied of its
uranium fuel and filled with concrete to keep residual
radioactivity from escaping.
   ``People are just concerned,'' Carolyn Dunn said at an earlier
demonstration by about 20 people at an Astoria pier. ``We just wish
it weren't happening.''
   The main fear is that radioactivity from the vessel will seep
into the Columbia from the dump site, she said.
   ``It's not what goes up the river that we worry about at this
point so much as what's going to come down the river in leakage
later,'' said Dunn.
   The U.S. Department of Energy has said the barge's cargo is no
threat to the public.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Trade Actions Against Nations with Fleets Using Huge
Nets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members from Washington and Oregon urged
President Bush on Tuesday to take trade action against nations
refusing to regulate fishing fleets which use huge nets in the
North Pacific.
   U.S. fishermen claim the so-called driftnets are used to
illegally snare millions of salmon, while environmentalists contend
the nets are responsible for killing thousands of porpoises, seals,
seabirds and other marine life every year.
   The nets, which can stretch up to 35 miles, have been used since
the early 1980s by about 700 vessels from Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan to catch squid.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., introduced a non-binding
resolution, backed by her House colleagues in the Washington
delegation and Oregon's three Democrats in the House, urging Bush
to impose trade sanctions if nations with such fleets refuse to
``enter into and implement adequate driftnet monitoring and
enforcement agreements.''
   ``This has been called `biological strip-mining of the sea' and
that's exactly what it is,'' Unsoeld said at a news conference.
``The driftnet fleet can lay 30,000 miles of net on any given day,
catching and suffocating virtually every porpoise, seal, fish or
bird that comes into contact with it.
   ``That's not fishing; that's indiscriminate slaughter.''
   Unsoeld said the resolution ``sends an unmistakable message that
we want these pirates put out of business.'' She said driftnet
fleets are ``stealing'' an estimated 10,000 metric tons of salmon
worth an estimated $21 million annually.
   American fishermen say the illegal salmon netting has already
hurt fish runs in Washington state, Oregon and Alaska.
   By international agreement, driftnet fishing is limited to
certain areas that are supposed to be well away from salmon
grounds, but Unsoeld said the regulations are ignored.
   Talks with the Japanese aimed at reaching an agreement to
monitor the driftnet fleet and enforce various regulations broke
down over the weekend.
   The secretary of commerce, under a 1987 law, has until June 29
to notify the president of any country failing to enter into such
an agreement. Bush could then impose trade restrictions on imports
of fish products from those countries.
   Unsoeld said that if Bush fails to act, she and other lawmakers
were prepared to introduce legislation that would require trade
sanctions.

calls for his resignation.
   Though Takeshita went before lawmakers seeking to clear his name
in the nationally televised session, opposition leaders and some
conservative analysts said he only raised more doubts.
   ``I'm not sure why Takeshita agreed to speak today,'' said
Keiichiro Nakamura, who served an an aide to former Prime Minister
Takeo Miki. ``But if it was to increase the people's trust in the
Liberal Democratic Party, he probably did more harm than good.''
   Takeshita and his party have been battered by disclosures the
Recruit Co., a huge publishing conglomerate, sold bargain-priced
stock to prominent bureaucrats and businessmen. In all, 14 people
have been arrested and three Cabinet ministers have resigned in
connection with the scandal.
   The government's embarrassment heightened last week with several
news reports that turned national attention to Recruit political
donations to Takeshita before he became prime minister .
   On Tuesday, Takeshita told a special session of the lower house
budget committee that between 1985 and 1987, he had received $1
million from Recruit and its subsidiaries.
   He said they gave the money to his political support groups in
the form of donations and purchases of fund-raising party tickets.
   Takeshita was finance minister and secretary-general of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party at the time.
   He earlier acknowledged that a former aide and a relative bought
12,000 Recruit subsidiary shares for a profit of about $190,000.
But he denied any personal involvement.
   On Tuesday, he stressed the legality of the Recruit donations,
which he called ``indispensible elements for vital political
activities.''
   Takeshita went on to reject opposition party assertions his
administration no longer has the credibility to lead the nation.
   Vowing to stay in office, Takeshita said, ``At a time when
distrust of politics is growing among the people, it is my
responsibility to see that reform is carried out.''
   Leaders of the governing party said his appearance would help
put the Recruit affair into perspective and allow the government to
move on to other business.
   ``I think (Takeshita's explanations) should serve to distinguish
(that the donations were legal) and should put a period on the
criticism,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi.
   But Nakamura said not all members of the governing conservative
party were persuaded.
   ``Opinion within the ruling party is split, but more and more
people are realizing that the party just can't win elections with
Takeshita as its leader,'' he said.
   Elections for half of the seats in the upper house of Parliament
will be held this summer.
   Political analysts say no clear successor is ready to take over
Takeshita's job, and the opposition acknowledges it does not
control the votes needed to oust him.
   By acknowledging the donations, Takeshita reversed a statement
he made before lawmakers last October, when he denied receiving any
Recruit funds ``whatsoever.''
   ``Takeshita attempted to clear his name,'' Kanji Kawasaki, a
Socialist legislator who questioned Takeshita, said. ``But by
admitting to the flow of such large amounts of money, he has only
deepened the suspicions which surround him.''
   ``Takeshita simply lied until the truth was uncovered .... The
people of Japan will not be satisfied,'' said Kawasaki.
   Recruit sold unlisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary to
about 160 political, business and government officials at low
prices in 1986. Buyers of the shares received handsome profits when
the shares soared in value shortly after they were listed on the
market.
   Prosecutors say Recruit was trying to influence policies of the
labor and education ministries regarding the company's major
activity, publishing job placement magazines.
   No politicians have been arrested in the scandal, but
prosecutors have been reported to question several of them.

   U.N. troops opened checkpoints Tuesday
in northern Namibia, but South Africa said no guerrillas showed up
to begin a withdrawal to salvage a U.N. cease-fire and independence
plan for Namibia.
   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African spokesman for
the territorial police, said groups of more than 50 black
nationalist insurgents were seen heading south, disobeying orders
from their exiled leader to withdraw north to Angola.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa negotiated the withdrawal at the
weekend to get the independence plan back on track after heavy
fighting last week.
   Guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization are to
report to U.N.-supervised assembly points or border posts and leave
Namibia by Saturday.
   Du Rand said police trackers found evidence that only a handful
of guerrillas have crossed back into Angola of an estimated 1,900
which South Africa says entered Namibia starting April 1. Pretoria
has won international backing for its assertion the incursion
violates a regional peace accord calling for SWAPO fighters to stay
at bases in Angola until May 15.
   The Namibian Council of Churches said it received no reports of
guerrillas appearing at churches and missions, which have been
suggested safe gathering places.
   Territorial officials said the United Nations agreed that
territorial police supervised by U.N. peacekeepers could
interrogate guerrillas who report whereabouts of other insurgents
and possible arms caches. Du Rand said police are concerned some
guerrillas may hide their weapons, don civilian clothes and try to
stay in Namibia.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma said Monday in a radio interview with
the British Broadcasting Corp. that there is confusion about how to
spread word of the withdrawal. He said guerrillas would not trust
appeals from territorial authorities and most do not have radios to
hear broadcasts of the withdrawal agreement.
   A contingent of 210 Finnish soldiers flew Tuesday into Windhoek
to join U.N. forces monitoring the transition to independence,
including elections scheduled for November. About 1,400 of the
4,650-member force has arrived.
   Youths in Windhoek's black township, Katutura, boycotted classes
Tuesday to show support for guerrillas killed last week. Five of 14
schools were empty, the Education Department said.
   About 500 youths marched from school to school, hailing the
slain guerrillas as heroes and denouncing the paramilitary police
unit responsible for many of the deaths. SWAPO has been fighting
South African rule since 1966.
   Du Rand reported only ``a few skirmishes'' with guerrillas
Monday and Tuesday.
   He put the death toll at 263 guerrillas and 27 security force
members. SWAPO says its losses are much lower and charges at least
a fifth of those killed were civilians.
   The fighting broke out April 1, the first day of a yearlong
process to make Namibia independent of South Africa, which has
ruled the mineral-rich territory since World War I and in defiance
of U.N. demands it withdraw.
   In northern Namibia, more than 130 Australian, British,
Malaysian and Nigerian soldiers drove out of military bases Tuesday
in convoys of white trucks and landrovers to set up assembly points
in two remote villages and near seven border posts. They hung the
international organization's blue and white flag from trees,
aerials and poles.
   South Africa agreed to give Namibia independence in exchange for
Cuba withdrawing its 50,000 troops from Angola, where they
supported the Marxist government's forces in a civil war against
rebels backed by South Africa.

<HEAD>Tamil Militants Reject Cease-Fire Offer</HEAD>

   The largest Tamil militant group
Tuesday rejected a one-week cease-fire offered by President
Ranasinghe Premadasa, who sought to end six years of ethnic
violence that has claimed 12,500 lives.
   ``The government is only interested in getting our weapons and
has not put forward anything worthwhile,'' said a leader of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters Monday that
while troops operations were suspended, the militants should give
themselves up at 228 centers across the country. He said 104
militants, all Sinhalese, had surrendered before the centers were
set up.
   Premadasa offered the one-week truce beginning Wednesday to both
ethnic Tamil and majority Sinhalese militants. He said the military
would suspend offensives against the Tamil rebels during that time.
   The offer was part of a peace package that included general
amnesty, seats in Parliament and jobs for the militants on this
island off the southern coast of India.
   ``We will not agree to any cease-fire so long as the Indian arms
remain in Sri Lanka,'' the rebel leader told The Associated Press.
   In New Delhi, India, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said India had
decided to withdraw some of its peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka.
Spokesman Aftab Seth did not give details, saying only that a
``significant'' number would be pulled out.
   India moved in 50,000 troops to disarm the Tamil militants under
a July 1987 accord that aimed to end a Tamil insurgency in the
northern and northeastern provinces. The Liberation Tigers group
refused to accept the accord because it said the pact did not meet
enough of its demands for self-rule.
   In January, India withdrew an estimated 3,000 soldiers, saying
it did so out of respect for public wishes in Sri Lanka. Opponents
of the 1987 accord had feared Indian troops might remain on the
island indefinitely.
   Tamil militants in Sri Lanka launched a campaign in 1983 for an
independent homeland, citing discrimination by the Sinhalese in
employment and education.
   In a backlash, Sinhalese extremists of the Marxist People's
Liberation Front have killed more than 2,500 people since January.
They oppose the government's plan to grant Tamils limited autonomy.
   They have not reacted to the truce offer. In addition, the
government had no immediate reaction to the rebels' rejection.
   Also Tuesday, two gunmen from Sinhalese group broke into a house
outside Colombo and killed Sarat Algama, the twin brother of senior
military officer Brig. Lakshman Algama, officials said.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. Sinhalese, who are mainly Buddhists, make up 75
percent of the population and control the government and military.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Tuesday approved
legislation to reimpose limits on commercials in children's TV
shows and require broadcasters to inform and educate their young
audiences or lose their licenses.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote, sent
the Children's Television Practices Act to the full House, where it
was expected to pass easily.
   Congress passed the same bill last year but then-President
Reagan let it die without his signature. A companion measure has
been introduced in the Senate by Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
and Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   The Bush administration has not taken a public position on the
bill.
   Authors of the measure said it was designed to stop the
``overcommercialization'' of children's TV shows in the wake of a
1984 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to lift
limits on TV ads in shows aimed at youngsters.
   The FCC rules, established in 1974, had limited broadcasters to
nine and a half minutes of commercials per hour in children's shows.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., last week said some stations have
increased their ads to as much as 12 minutes to 14 minutes per hour
on such shows since 1984. At the same time, the average amount of
advertising on adult shows is only about eight minutes per hour,
said Markey, chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.
   The bill orders the FCC to limit ads on shows for children to 12
minutes per hour on weekdays and 10{ minutes per hour on weekends.
   In addition, the bill requires a TV station, before the FCC can
renew its license, to demonstrate it has ``served the educational
and informational needs of children in its overall programming.''
   Markey, under questioning by Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.,
acknowledged there were no hard definitions in the bill of what
constituted children's programming. But he said there was a
``general understanding'' that such shows are shown on Saturday
mornings and in early mornings and afternoons during the week.
   He also said programming such as ``The Cosby Show'' and
Disney-type programs could fall into the children's arena.
   Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., who co-authored the bill with
Reps. John Bryant, D-Texas, and Terry Bruce, D-Ill., said it was a
``carefully crafted bipartisan compromise.''
   Rep. Norman Lent of New York, the committee's ranking
Republican, said the bill ``provides modest but needed correction
to excesses in children's TV advertising practices. It also
encourages TV stations to improve their children's programming.''
   The bill would be effective Jan. 1, 1990. It was adopted in
cooperation with the National Association of Broadcasters and the
Association of Independent Television Stations.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Phased Lifting of Gas Price Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel approved legislation Tuesday to
end 35 years of federal control of natural gas prices, a step
cheered by the energy industry but criticized by some consumer
groups even though decontrol could mean slightly cheaper gas for
the nation's consumers.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote without
dissent, sent the measure to the full House, where even its
strongest critics say approval is likely.
   A similar measure has been introduced but not yet act on in the
Senate.
   The legislation would complete a price decontrol process that
began in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen
categories of gas, each with a ceiling price.
   About one-third of U.S. natural gas currently is subject to
federal price controls.
   The House bill, sponsored by Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., would
lift the remaining price controls as supply contracts expire or are
renegotiated, with all such limits to be removed by Jan. 1, 1993.
Controls would be ended immediately for gas not subject to a
contract on the date of the legislation's enactment.
   Past efforts by the gas industry to win price-control
legislation foundered on fears that prices paid by the 48 million
households using natural gas would increase.
   Such concerns have faded. The collapse of oil prices in 1986,
coupled with the effects of moves by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to liberalize the gas industry, led to falling gas
prices, excess supplies and greatly increased competition.
   ``I think gas prices are going to fall'' if full decontrol is
enacted, said Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La. Any price movements are
expected to be small because most of the controlled gas already
sells at prices below the federally set ceilings.
   Industry officials contend that ending federal price regulation
will stimulate production and use of natural gas without leading to
higher consumer bills.
   ``For consumers this will mean supply and demand, not arcane
government regulations, will set natural gas prices with the least
expensive gas being produced first,'' Nicholas J. Bush, president
of the Natural Gas Supply Association, said after the House
committee vote. His group represents gas producers.
   Some consumer organizations oppose the House decontrol bill,
although they acknowledge that lifting the price limits is not
likely to mean higher consumer bills. Their main objection is that
the legislation ignores other, more significant, gas issues that
are having the effect of inflating home heating bills.
   ``This bill does nothing for consumers,'' said Edwin S.
Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy
Coalition.
   Rothschild and other consumer advocates say Congress should be
tackling such related issues as the ``take-or-pay'' problem that is
forcing consumers to help pay the cost of voiding high-priced
supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s when, unlike
today, supplies were tight and prices were rising.
   The Bush administration strongly supports gas decontrol, and
Watkins has said a liberalized gas industry is part of his overall
strategy for strengthening the nation's energy base and reversing
the trend toward higher energy imports.
   The decontrol move comes at a time of growing political and
commercial support for expanding the use of natural gas, which
currently accounts for about one-quarter of the country's energy
supply. Gas is gaining popularity in part because it is considered
more environmentally benign than oil and other fossil fuels.
   A Senate bill, for example, calls for spending $100 million over
three years to finance demonstration projects that use natural gas
for mass transit and training programs for conversion of gasoline
and diesel-fueled vehicles to run on natural gas.
   The House panel also approved legislation to create an
independent, 11-member commission to recommend to President Bush
and the Congress a comprehensive approach to cleaning up toxic and
radioactive wastes at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons
plants. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins opposes that bill.

   An explosion and fire at in Chevron's huge
east San Francisco Bay refinery cut the plant's gasoline and jet
fuel production cut by 25 percent, the company said.
   Monday's blast sent towering clouds of sooty smoke boiling into
the sky from the 4{-square-mile Richmond plant and injured eight
workers and firefighters with burns, smoke inhalation and shock.
   Firefighters decided to allow the blaze to burn itself out and
residual pockets of fuel continued burning Tuesday.
   The burned unit, a cracking column which separates crude oil
into its various components from light fuels to heavy lubricants,
produced about 10 percent of the West Coast's oil requirements, the
company said.
   Chevron spokesman Glenn Weaver could not say if the production
shortfall would cause any retail increase at the pumps in the
western states, but that Chevron planned to compensate by dipping
into inventories and increasing production at other refineries.
   ``It's hard to isolate what the movement in prices ... might be;
one thing we know is our costs will go up,'' he said.
   The company said the stricken unit could be out of commission
for at least two months, but management would not speculate on
repair and replacement costs.
   The 87-year-old plant handles 270,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Weaver said company investigators were still trying to determine
the cause of the lunch-hour eruption. The plant employs about 1,800
people.
   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District reported that
although the smoke did not register on monitoring stations near the
plant Chevron might be liable for a $1,000 fine ``for creating a
public nuisance.''
   The smoke was not toxic, said Contra Costa County Health
Director Mark Finucane, rating the smoke about as dangerous as that
produced in a fireplace.

   A high-rated NCAA championship basketball game
helped CBS come in second in last week's Nielsens, but didn't
budget NBC from No. 1, even though ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the
top-rated show of the week.
   Last year, the NCAA championship game was enough to give CBS a
first for the week. This year, the game had a somewhat lower
rating, but was still in the top 10.
   According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., the top-rated shows of the
week were: ``Roseanne'' ABC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Cheers''
NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``NCAA
Championship _ Michigan vs. Seton Hall'' CBS, ``Golden Girls'' NBC,
``Empty Nest'' NBC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS.
   NBC won the week ending April 2 with a 15.4 rating. CBS had a
13.0 and ABC a 12.5. For the season, NBC has a 16.0, ABC a 12.9 and
CBS 12.6.
   ``Roseanne'' had the highest rating of the week, 23.3, but a
lower share, 35, than ``Cosby'' with a 38. Each rating point
represents 904,000 households with television. The share is a
percentage of sets in use.
   NBC said the ``Cosby'' rating was lower because of the switch to
daylight saving time affecting shows that are on at the beginning
of prime-time when in many parts of the country it's still light
outside. ``Roseanne'' is on an hour into prime time.
   ABC's ``Columbo'' did well, coming in 12th for the week. But the
bad news for ABC is ``Moonlighting,'' which went on hiatus earlier
this year, then moved to Sunday night where it is in the bottom 10
of the Nielsen ratings with a 6.2 and a 10 share. Only two other
shows, both of them on ABC, rank lower: ``HeartBeat'' and ``Men.''
Three Fox shows had better ratings than ``Moonlighting.''
   The Masters golf tournament ran over into prime time Sunday,
pushing back CBS' schedule for almost an hour. ABC won the Sunday
movie battle with a repeat of ``Romancing the Stone.'' It was 15th,
out-rating NBC's Perry Mason movie, at 18th. CBS' ``Bridge to
Silence,'' starring Marlee Matlin in her first speaking role,
ranked 35th.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Hard Time on Planet
Earth,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Rock 'n' Roll Mom,'' ``Quantum
Leap,'' ``Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting,'' ``Great Circuses
of the World,'' ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``Moonlighting,
``HeartBeat'' and ``Men.''

   Syrian gunners shelled Christian areas
Tuesday in spite of a 6-day-old truce called by the Arab League,
and Paris sent an envoy to work out a distribution plan for two
shiploads of French humanitarian aid.
   Police said the howitzer shells landed in a scattered pattern in
Christian territory and no casualties were reported. They said the
Christians held their fire.
   Moslem-Christian artillery duels began five weeks ago and
developed into the worst sectarian fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war. Police give the casualties, nearly all
civilians, as 180 killed and 619 wounded.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands the 20,000 Christians of
Lebanon's army, imposed a blockade March 6 on illegal militia-run
ports that deprive the government of an estimated $100 million a
year in revenue.
   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia started shooting two days later
and Syrian gunners soon joined them. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Bernard Kouchner, French minister for humanitarian assistance,
arrived ahead of the two ships carrying food, fuel and medical
supplies, which have caused an argument between Moslems and
Christians.
   Moslems claim France, from which Lebanon became independent in
1943, favors the Christians. The French government has expressed
concern over the fate of Lebanon's Christians.
   Kouchner spent 45 minutes with acting Premier Salim Hoss, who
heads a Moslem cabinet that has competed with a Christian
government led by Aoun since a political crisis began in September.
   Hoss convened his cabinet afterward, then issued a statement
saying the Moslem government rejected ``the French donation until
the French stand toward the Lebanese crisis is clarified.''
   Kouchner told reporters France was determined to deliver the aid
to ``all the Lebanese'' and would meet with several leaders to plan
the distribution.
   He said French policy ``supports a political settlement in
Lebanon.''
   Jumblatt has warned the French not to bring the ships into a
Christian port.
   Before meeting in west Beirut with Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
Kouchner conferred with Aoun in Baabda, the Christian suburb where
the presidential palace is located. By unwritten agreement since
1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni and
the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   The relief ships left for Lebanon last week. France has not said
when they will arrive, but they are expected Wednesday.
   One carries food and fuel. The other is a hospital ship with
beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies.
   Fear has been expressed that more fighting will accompany the
ships' arrival. A French envoy who was in Lebanon last week _
Jean-Francois Deniau of the National Assembly's foreign affairs
committee _ was quoted Tuesday as saying it ``would be an act of
war against France'' to fire on the ships.
   ``If they fire, it is clear that they want to destroy Lebanon,''
he was quoted as saying in the Tours, France daily La Nouvelle
Republique du Centre-Ouest.
   Youssef Aridi, a grocer in Moslem west Beirut, said: ``I think
Wednesday will be a bad day. I won't leave home. If they shell the
French, God knows what will happen.''
   Lebanon's latest government crisis began when President Amin
Gemayel's six-year term ended in September and Parliament could not
agree on a successor. Gemayel chose Aoun, the army comnmander, to
lead an interim administration and Moslems swore allegiance to
Hoss, the incumbent premier.
   The army also split on sectarian lines, with Aoun commanding the
Christians and Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib taking charge of the 22,000
Moslems.

   President Bush honored 18 people and
organizations Tuesday that he said have ``enriched the American
spirit'' by their volunteer efforts.
   ``To serve others, to enrich your community, this truly defines
a successful life,'' the president told the award winners at a
White House ceremony.
   Receiving the Ronald Reagan Award for Volunteer Excellence was
the Rev. Bruce Ritter, who founded and operates Covenant House, a
shelter for homeless children in the East Village section of New
York City.
   Bush said the Reagan award was started last year to honor the
individual or organization whose contribution was considered the
largest among the recipients of the President's Volunteer Action
Awards.
   Founded by Ritter in 1968, Covenant House now serves 25,000
children annually.
   Among the other recipients was Habitat for Humanity, an
organization based in Americus, Ga., that works to provide low-cost
housing for the poor. Former President Carter has been a volunteer
carpenter for the group.
   The other award winners were:
   Chessie Harris of Huntsville, Ala.; the California Marine Mammal
Center of Sausalito; the Great American First Savings Bank of San
Diego; Judeo Christian Health Clinic of Tampa, Fla.; Allison
Stieglitz of Miami Fla.; United Auto Workers Local 31, Kansas City,

<BYLINE>Soviet Navy Announces Plans to Raise Sunken Submarine ^By JOHN

   The Soviet navy said Tuesday it plans to retrieve
a nuclear submarine that sank off Norway to learn what caused the
accident that killed 42 sailors.
   ``We consider that we must raise it,'' Vice Adm. Sergei P.
Vargin said on the nightly television news program Vremya.
   Vargin, who is with the Soviet Baltic Fleet, said details of how
to bring the submarine up from nearly 5,000 feet below the surface
had not been worked out.
   ``The experts will deal with it,'' he said, adding that the hull
was believed to be cracked but intact. The sub caught fire and sank
Friday in the Norwegian Sea.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, has said a short circuit
probably caused the fire.
   Vargin repeated the Soviet position that there is no danger of
radiation leakage. He said the reactors were shut down before the
crew evacuated and neither of the two nuclear-tipped torpedoes was
armed for combat.
   In Oslo, Norwegian officials said tests on water samples at the
sub's level showed no radiation, but the Norway would not declare
the zone clean until a more extensive examination late this week.
   Soviet media reports Tuesday said the sub commander, Capt.
Yevgeny Vanin, pulled a sailor through a smoke-filled hatch, then
died while trying to reach other survivors.
   ``He had spent all his energy saving sailors and he perished in
front of his crew,'' Lt. Andrei Zaitsev told the official news
agency Tass from his hospital bed in Murmansk.
   Another crew member, Capt. B. Kolyada, said the first thing the
crew did when the fire started was secure the nuclear reactor and
nuclear-tipped torpedoes.
   Several of the 27 survivors were shown on television greeting
their families and praising the courage of shipmates.
   One crewman, not identified, said: ``We were in the water for an
hour and a half, but we never doubted that we would be rescued.
There was no panic, absolutely no panic at all.''
   Official media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members, 42 of
whom were killed. Officials say only 19 bodies have been recovered.
   Tass said the commander was the last person to leave the
submarine when it started to sink and the crew could not put out
the fire.
   ``Prior to that he looked once again into the submarine's exit
hatch belching out smoke,'' it said. ``One of the seamen was there.
The commander dived into the icy water, swimming toward the
inflatable life rafts.''
   Vanin died in the water before he could reach a raft, the agency
said.

<HEAD>Government Says Treatment Makes Pigs Eat More, Get Bigger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
scientists have invented a vaccine to make pigs piggier.
   Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of
22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs
without the treatment, the department's Agricultural Research
Service reported.
   ``If a commercial product results from this venture and is
approved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality pork
produced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologist
Jerome C. Pekas.
   The USDA agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreement
with Codon, a San Francisco biotechnology firm, for development and
further testing of the vaccine.
   Pekas, who works at the agency's meat animal research center in
Clay Center, Neb., said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment
of cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in the
upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans.
   When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreign
carrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragment
as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the
natural CCK hormone, he said.
   When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they've
had enough to eat. So they keep on eating.

   A man who tried to steal the tires from a

police said.
   Arnold Lloyd, 47, was being held without bail for investigation
of murdering Michael Stephenson, 20, of Pomona.
   Lloyd confronted Stephenson about 2 a.m. outside his home as
Stephenson tried to steal the tires, police said.
   Stephenson leaped into the bed of a friend's pickup truck and
was being driven away when Lloyd fired a .22-caliber revolver once,
said police Sgt. Elias Valdez.
   Police found Stephenson not far away with a gunshot wound in the
back. Doctors at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center were unable

<HEAD>Diplomats Say Iran-Iraq Peace Talks Resuming April 20 In Geneva</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers from Iran and Iraq will
try to break a deadlock in peace negotiations in a new round of
talks beginning April 20 in Geneva, diplomats said Tuesday.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will mediate the
talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his
Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, the diplomats said.
   The U.N. chief is expected to publicly announce the date for
resumption of talks Wednesday, said the diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Velayati and Aziz had previously agreed to hold a new round of
direct talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near U.N.
headquarters.
   No explanation was given for switching the site to Geneva, but
the change may have been made because Perez de Cuellar will be
touring Europe in late April. His itinerary has not yet been
announced.
   The peace talks ran into a stalemate in August after Iraq
demanded that Iran agree to a U.N. plan to clear war debris from
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming their southern border. The
waterway is Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   Iran refused. It says Iraq must withdraw from Iranian territory
it still holds before other issues can be addressed.
   The Persian Gulf War broke out in September 1980. At least 1
million people were been killed or wounded.
   The two sides signed a U.N.-mediated cease-fire in August,
beginning the talks aimed at a permanent settlement five days later.

   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the
volunteers contributed more than 1,900 person-years worth of work
valued at $25.5 million. Since the annual volunteer program began,
he said, more than 440,000 have participated, performing an
estimated $185 million worth of work.
   The volunteers serve as campground hosts, plant trees, maintain
trails, improve fish and wildlife habitat, patrol wildernesses,
assist scientists, write publications and help keep office records.
   Robertson said the program is open to groups and organizations
as well as individuals on a full-time, part-time or one-time basis
at most Forest Service locations.

<HEAD>West Germany Opens Second Spy Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 45-year-old engineer accused of
spying testified Tuesday that he gave sensitive documents to
communist agents after one of them befriended him and gave him a
job.
   The trial was the second involving espionage to open in West
Germany in two days. At a trial Monday in Duesseldorf, a woman said
she gave sensitive data to a Soviet spy because she loved him.
   At Tuesday's trial, Helmut Stefan Kolasch, who worked for an
electronics firm that did military work, is charged with providing
sensitive computer information on NATO jet fighters to East Germany
and the Soviet KGB intelligence service from 1973 through 1984.
   ``I didn't want to have anything to do with those people, I
somehow got pulled into it and then feared they would pressure me
if I did not cooperate,'' Kolasch told the court.
   ``Now I have to accept the fact that I supported the KGB. That
is an enormous burden for me to bear,'' Kolasch told the court.
   Kolasch was arrested in March 1988, the same month as former
high-ranking government secretary Elke Falk, whose trial opened
Monday. Ms. Falk has acknowledged providing state secrets to the
KGB from 1975 to 1985.
   Prosecutors say Kolasch photographed documents pertaining to
jets of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and sold the
papers to communist agents while he worked at the West German
electronics firm Siemens.
   Among the information handed over by Kolasch were details on a
sensitive aircraft electronics system he himself had developed at
Siemens, prosecutors say.
   According to court documents, Kolasch handed over the material
to contacts in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Karlsruhe and
collected more than $16,200.
   Kolasch said Tuesday he had provided material to an East German
agent using the alias Heinz Groth, whose whereabouts are unknown.
   The prosecution says Groth put Kolasch in contact with a KGB
intelligence agent, whom the court said then worked as a secretary
in the Soviet Consulate in Bonn.
   Kolasch told the court he was a student in 1968 when he first
met Groth.
   According to Kolasch, Groth gave him a part-time job with a
building-cleaning company he operated at the time. He said a
friendship developed.
   Kolasch said he began providing photographed computer
information to Groth in 1973 ``because I felt obligated to him.''
   ``At that time, I didn't have much money,'' Kolasch said.
   The trial was adjourned until Thursday. If found guilty, both
Kolasch and Ms. Falk could face a maximum sentence of 10 years.

<HEAD>Israel Asks Poland To Help Remove Auschwitz Convent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens appealed Tuesday
to a visiting Polish Cabinet minister to press for removal of a
Roman Catholic Carmelite convent from the site of the Auschwitz
death camp, officials said.
   In Geneva, the European leader of the Jewish organization B'nai
B'rith said in a telephone interview that Jewish-Catholic relations
will remain frozen until the convent is gone.
   Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders agreed in February 1987 in
Geneva to transfer the convent's 14 nuns to a new location by
February 1989. Their declaration recognized the special
significance of Auschwitz to Jews.
   Some of the 6 million Jews who died in the World War II Nazi
Holocaust were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland.
   Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich, European Director of B'nai B'rith, said
Tuesday, however, ``resistance by the Catholic rank-and-file and
others in all of Poland'' has prevented progress toward fulfilling
the Geneva pact. He was one of the signatories.
   Moreover, he called three crosses placed at the site by the nuns
last fall a ``clear provocation.''
   He said no new site had been picked for the order and that no
blueprint had been drawn up, despite reported intervention by Pope
John Paul II. The convent has been at Auschwitz since 1984.
   In Jerusalem, Arens met with Polish Minister of Religious
Affairs Wladyslav Loranc and told him ``the continued presence of
the Carmelite convent on that site causes very strong pains and
indignation in Israel,'' Foreign Ministry officials said.
   Arens told Loranc he hoped the government of Poland would find a
way to put the 1987 agreement into effect, said the Israeli
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Polish officials made no comment.
   Loranc is spending eight days in Israel as an official guest of
Israel's minister of religion, Zevulun Hammer.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed a formal
complaint with the House ethics committee Tuesday accusing
Republican whip Newt Gingrich of violating House rules with an
unusual 1984 book promotion deal.
   Alexander listed 10 alleged violations of House rules in the
complaint, filed as the ethics committee discussed behind closed
doors the results of a lengthy investigation of House Speaker Jim
Wright that was initiated by Gingrich.
   ``Mr. Gingrich is a congressional Jimmy Swaggart, who condemns
sin while committing hypocrisy,'' Alexander said.
   The complaint, which under House rules will force the ethics
committee to vote on whether to investigate the Georgia Republican,
centers around a limited partnership created to promote ``Window of
Opportunity,'' a book written by Gingrich; his wife, Marianne
Gingrich, and David Drake.
   The partnership involved 21 investors who put up $5,000 each to
promote the book, in exchange for a promise of half of the profits
that normally would have accrued to the publisher. The publisher,
however, ended up losing money on the book and the investors got a
tax write off.
   Gingrich, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the
book deal, said Tuesday that the partnership was controlled by his
wife and that he was not aware of the details of the arrangement.
   But he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written
questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his
office by members of Congress and reporters since the existence of
the partnership was disclosed last month.
   Mrs. Gingrich has acknowledged receiving less than $10,000 from
the partnership for her work in setting up the deal and
coordinating the promotional effort.
   Gingrich said Tuesday his wife ``resents the implication'' in
Alexander's complaint that she was used as a conduit to funnel
money to him in violation of House rules. He said she has contacted
an attorney to determine if she has grounds for legal action.
   In addition to the promotional deal, Gingrich said the book
involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each
received 3 percent royalties and Drake 2 percent.
   But Alexander said the payments Gingrich received cannot be
characterized as royalties because of the unique promotional deal
associated with the book. Consequently, Alexander argued, those
payments are not exempt from the House rule limiting outside earned
income, as royalties are.
   Alexander also alleged that the promotional deal involved four
apparent violations of House limitations on gifts, one possible
conversion of campaign funds to personal use, two possible
instances of conversion of government resources to personal use,
one apparent violation of House financial disclosure rules and one
apparent violation of the campaign finance law.

<TEXT>
   A public prosecutor freed Tuesday four
U.S. citizens detained a week ago on charges of violating laws that
prohibit proselytizing, the Anatolia news agency said.
   The four were freed following questioning by the prosecutor, the
agency said without further explanation.
   An Istanbul police chief, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said authorities are trying to find a way to deport the four, who
reportedly belong to an unidentified Christian fundamentalist group.
   Anatolia quoted officials of the prosecutor's office as saying
the investigation into the case is continuing to determine whether
the four should face trial.
   The four were detained April 4 as they distributed pamphlets
protesting the portrayal of Jesus in the film ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' outside a theater at the Istanbul Cinema Festival.
   Turkish law bans proselytizing and a conviction carries a
maximum 10-year jail sentence.
   Police identified the four as David Kim Wilson, 35, of Chicago,
and his wife Pamela Lynn, 32, of Des Moines, Iowa; Norma Cox, 45,
of Chicago; and Brian Scott Thorsvik, listed only as being from
Washington state.
   A police spokesman said the Wilsons were traveling as tourists
in Turkey, Cox was teaching English and Thorsvik was a university
student.
   Christians in Western countries demonstrated when Martin
Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was released last
year, charging it is blasphemous because it depicts Jesus
hallucinating about marrying Mary Magdalene and having sex.
   A group of Moslem fundamentalists also protested in front of the
Turkish film festival April 4, calling the movie offensive to
Moslems.
   Iran has criticised Turkey for including the film and withdrew
its own entry from the festival program, Turkish newspapers
reported.
   Religious issues have strained relations between the two
nations, and both countries recalled their ambassadors for
consultations last week.

   Two major nursing-home groups filed suit
against the government Tuesday to block provisions of a law
requiring nursing homes to turn away the mentally ill and mentally
retarded.
   The American Health Car Association and the American Association
of Homes for the Aging said the federal government is requiring
states to implement the law, which took effect Jan. 1, even though
the Department of Health and Human Services has issued no
regulations to guide them.
   They said the result is that the law will hurt the people it was
intended to help by denying them admission to nursing homes even
when no alternate care facilities are available.
   Nursing home applicants and patients who are mentally retarded
or mentally ill ``are being held hostage by this legislation and
its misguided implementation,'' said Sheldon Goldberg, president of
the American Association of Homes for the Aging, which represents
about 2,500 nursing homes.
   Though he did not cite specific instances in which mentally ill
or mentally retarded patients have been discharged from nursing
homes, he said his concern was ``that could happen in the future.''
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, naming HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan. Department officials
had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
   Under the law, nursing homes will lose federal Medicaid funds if
they accept patients who suffer from mental illness or mental
retardation unless they also need nursing home care. Nursing homes
get about 44 percent of their revenues from the federal-state
Medicaid program. Patients who have lived in a nursing home for
fewer than 30 months also must be screened for mental illness and
mental retardtion, under the law.
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health
Care Association, which represents about 9,000 nursing homes, said
that without regulations from the HHS, nursing homes don't know how
to define mental illness. The law exempts Alzheimer's disease, but
diagnosis of the condition is difficult and its victims are often
classified as mentally ill, he noted.
   Depending on how mental illness is defined, an estimated 26,000
to 208,000 current residents of the 1.5 million Americans in
nursing homes might have to be involuntarily discharged under the
law, he said.
   With few alternate care facilities available in most areas, he
said, many of these patients may be left homeless, without even
basic levels of care.
   Willging and Goldberg said the law is well-intentioned in that
it seeks to ensure that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get
the specialized treatment they need for their conditions.
   ``But it is equally important to provide some elementary
protections,'' Willging said. ``We demand the horse be put before
the cart.''
   The suit asks the court to put the screening requirements of the
law on hold until HHS issues implementing regulations. It also asks
the court to prohibit application of the rules to private-pay
patients.
   Restraining orders have been issued by courts in Idaho, Arkansas
and Texas in response to suits filed by nursing-home groups,
Willging said. A suit also has been filed in Louisiana, he said.
   Earlier this year, Terry Coleman, then-deputy director of HHS's
Health Care Financing Administration, said the law was an effort to
get states to develop group-home and community-based services for
the mentally ill and mentally retarded.
   Historically, it has been the states' responsibility to fund
services and facilities for the mentally ill, he said. To avoid
this cost, however, some states have sent these patients to nursing
homes, where Medicaid picks up the tab for those who cannot pay.
   More states have special facilities for the mentally retarded
because Medicaid helps pay for them, but nursing home care for
these patients is often cheaper, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Navy on Tuesday issued a public denial
stating it had never received any medical evidence suggesting
sailors who served aboard nuclear missile submarines were more
likely to contract cancer.
   Responding to a report Monday in a trade publication alleging
increased risk, the Navy released a 140-page statistical study
performed by the Yale School of Medicine that tracked both the
in-service and post-service death rates for nuclear submariners.
   The study, conducted at a cost of $600,000, was originally
completed in August 1985 and then updated and revised in April 1987.
   The Navy insisted there was no reason to challenge the study's
conclusion that submariners were not placed at higher risk as a
result of their occupation, adding in a statement it would stand by
the work of the Yale researchers.
   ``The U.S. Naval Medical Command has reviewed the Yale study, in
view of recent news media reports ...,'' the statement said.
   ``The U.S. Naval Medical Command finds that there is no basis in
the Yale study to conclude there is any health concern related to
cancer rates and submarine service on either attack nuclear-powered
submarines or ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarines.''
   Navy News and Undersea Technology, a weekly trade publication,
reported Monday the Navy's statistical study contained evidence
that sailors who had served aboard nuclear-missile submarines were
more likely to develop cancer than their civilian counterparts.
   The publication said the research reported an ``observed'' rate
of cancer cases among former missile submarine personnel of 54,
compared to an ``expected'' rate for the general population of 39.4.
   By contrast, the statistics for sailors who served aboard
nuclear-powered attack submarines _ vessels that do not carry
nuclear-tipped missiles _ showed the number of cancer deaths
precisely matching the expected rate: 22 versus 22.5.
   The publication also quoted Dr. Michael Sheridan, an
epidemiologist and biostatistician at Georgetown University, as
saying the study utilized procedures that were bound to be biased
in the Navy's favor and to underestimate cancer rates.
   The Navy, in responding Tuesday, said the trade publication had
failed to take account of the fact that all such mortality
statistics are developed with a range of numbers.
   While the numbers cited by the publication are correct, as drawn
from one table, the observed rate of 54 cancer cases compares to an
expected range of ``26 to 53, based on nationwide averages,'' the
Navy said.
   ``The Yale researchers found that there were 54 actual deaths,
one higher than expected. A small increase such as this may be due
to normal statistical variation in a group of this size.''
   The Navy said the Yale researchers themselves had made the same
point in the study, writing: ``It is not proper to interpret this
Standard Mortality Ratio as statistical `proof' that men on
(nuclear missile) submarines are at elevated risk of cancer ...''
   The study distributed on Tuesday was originally requested in
1974 by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her military affairs
assistant at the time, Capt. James Bush, a retired Navy submarine
skipper who developed cancer.
   Bush, who was treated and survived his cancer, is now an
associate director at the Washington-based Center for Defense
Information.
   Bush has said his interest in pushing the Navy to conduct the
study was spawned by his own experience and the fact that he
personally knew 14 former submariners who developed or died from
the disease, including four from the same missile boat that he
commanded.
   Phone calls to Bush on Tuesday to discuss the Navy's response
were not immediately returned.

<HEAD>Soviets Cut Length of Military Service for Graduates</HEAD>

   The Soviet Defense Ministry will cut the length of
military service required for students who have completed higher
education courses, the official Tass news agency said Tuesday.
   Under new regulations for conscription, students who graduate
this spring will be required to serve only one year in the military
instead of 18 months in the army and air force or two years in the
navy, the news agency said.
   The new regulations were expected to begin with the spring
intake of conscripts, Tass said.
   The Defense Ministry announced in March that students could
defer military service until after graduation, but it did not
specify the length of service that would be required.
   Previously, all Soviet men between the ages of 18 and 25 were
liable for the draft, and there were no exemptions for students.
   Changes in the conscription system have been under discussion
for the past five years, and the program of officer training is
also under review, according to the Communist youth newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The new rules apply only to conscripts and not officers or
officer candidates, Tass said. About 75 percent of Soviet military
personnel are conscripts.
   Changes in the draft law follow the announcement Dec. 7 by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the United Nations that Soviet
troop strength would be cut by 500,000 and military spending would
be reduced by 14 percent.

   A coalition of environmental groups on
Tuesday sued the state of Pennsylvania and the federal government,
alleging they had failed to reduce ozone pollution in the
Philadelphia area.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks to block more
than $100 million in federal highway and clean-air planning grants
until the state takes action to clean the air.
   ``We believe that Pennsylvania has not made a good-faith effort
to meet the standards of the Clean Air Act,'' said Joseph Minott,
executive director of the Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for
Clean Air, one of the plaintiffs.
   ``If they won't do it voluntarily, we'll get a court to force
them to do it,'' he said.
   Ozone pollution forms when fumes from gasoline and other organic
chemicals such as cleaning solvents and paint interact with the
sun's heat and light. Ozone is the principal component of the
brownish smog that covers Philadelphia and other urban areas,
especially in the summer months.
   ``1988 was Pennsylvania's worst year for ozone pollution since
the re-authorization of the Clean Air Act in 1977,'' said Jerome
Balter of the Public Interest Law Center, lead attorney for the
council.
   A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee
Blackburn, said the federal agency had been expecting the suit, but
he declined to comment on it until he had read the complaint.
   Susan Woods, spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Resources said the state is trying to launch a
far-reaching effort to control ozone pollution with new gasoline
volatility regulations.
   But a state Senate committee, citing costs and possible gas
shortages, recommended last week that the new rules not go into
effect completely until 1992.
   Groups joining in the lawsuit, in addition to the Delaware
Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, include the Sierra Club,
the Delaware Valley Toxics Coalition and the Pennsylvania
Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs.

<HEAD>Bush Will Propose Stricter Ethical Standards, Judicial Raises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush intends to call for more
stringent ethical rules on executive branch officials and recommend
a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges in a sweeping
ethics-in-government program to be unveiled Wednesday,
administration officials said Tuesday.
   But these officials said Bush has decided for the time being
against recommending any hike in the $89,500 salary received by
members of Congress, and will recommend no change in the widely
criticized system that permits lawmakers to earn thousands of
dollars in speaking fees.
   Bush, who promised during last year's campaign to crack down on
ethical laxness in government, arranged to lay out his
recommendations in a speech at the American Society of Newspaper
Editors convention.
   Among the recommendations is one extending the one-year ban that
currently prohibits executive branch employees from lobbying their
former office to have it apply to members of Congress and to
judges, said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   In making his proposals, Bush is expected to accept most of the
recommendations made by a special commission he established, and
discard some others.
   The commission that Bush set up to recommend changes for an
ethics overhaul had called for a ban on honoraria to members of
Congress for speaking engagements or similar work. Such honoraria
provide thousands of dollars in outside income for senators and
representatives in a system that critics, including Bush's ethics
panel, contend allows for too much special interest influence on
the representatives.
   But the president decided that the issue of honoraria should be
considered in conjunction with the question of a congressional pay
raise, separate from the ethics package he was preparing to put
forward Wednesday, said the official who spoke anonymously.
   Bush's proposal is expected to cover matters such as outside
income, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, enforcement
and restrictions on what executive branch employees can do after
they leave the government.
   His announcement follows the March 10 report by his eight-member
ethics commission, which detailed 27 recommendations for changes in
ethics laws and regulations as they apply to senior officials,
judges and members of Congress and their staffs.
   In addition to proposals that require congressional legislation,
Bush will issue an executive order covering executive branch
employees, the administration sources said.
   The order will include provisions to give elevated rank to a
designated ethics officer in each department, and will do away with
``compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the executive
branch for purposes of lobbying after working for the government.
   The current one-year lobbying ban for executive branch workers
would remain but would be extended to cover all agencies rather
than just the one in which the individual was employed.
   For instance, a former employee of the vice president's staff
would be precluded not only from lobbying that office but also any
other executive branch agency, such as the Office of Management and
Budget.
   Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its March 10
recommendations, reiterated Bush's campaign pledge to seek the same
ethical standards for the judicial and legislative branches of
government that apply to the executive branch.
   The panel recommended a ban on honoraria for all three branches.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, without
specifically confirming that Bush had dropped the honoraria
provision for members of Congress, said Tuesday that the president
believes the matter should be discussed in conjunction with
congressional pay raises.
   ``We have always said that honoraria are a part of the pay
equation and we do not intend to deal with the congressional pay
raise, so it makes sense we wouldn't deal with the other part of
it,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Bush does intend to ``work with Congress'' to come up with a pay
raise coupled with a resolution on the honoraria question, said an
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush backed previous pay raise legislation, but Congress itself
voted against giving its members a raise earlier this year.
   ``The subject of honoraria is inherently attached to pay raises.
He'd like to work with the Congress separately on it rather than
cramming the honoraria ban down their throat,'' the source said.
   Bush's executive order also bars senior government officials
from serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises, an area
that caused complications for his own White House counsel, C.
Boyden Gray.
   Gray voluntarily stepped down as chairman of a family-owned
communications company after it was revealed that he continued to
hold the post in contradiction to Bush's planned ethics guidelines.
   Bush's reported decision on the honoraria question brought
immediate criticism from Fred Wertheimer, president of the
organization Common Cause, which backs a congressional pay raise
and wants to do away with all honoraria.
   He said Bush's proposal undermines the president's avowed effort
to set stricter ethical standards for government.
   ``It appears he has caved in to pressure by members of Congress
who want to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and it
appears the president doesn't have the courage of his convictions.''

<HEAD>Cuba Programming Interrupts S. Fla. Prime Time; TV Marti Retaliation?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Viewers watching WCIX-TV were surprised when Cuban
television cut in briefly with a preview of ``Endless Love''
starring Brooke Shields and a shot of Giron, the site of the Bay of
Pigs invasion.
   And viewers switching past channel 3, a blank, unused channel in
Miami, also got a taste of Cuban government programming.
   Some think the interference Saturday and Monday was intentional,
a warning against the United States proceeding with plans for TV
Marti, an alternative to Cuba's state-controlled media and the next
step after the success of Radio Marti.
   ``The reason (Fidel) Castro may be doing this now is that the
legislation to authorize TV Marti is going to be debated on the
floor of the House this week,'' said Barbara Burris, an aide to
Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and a key backer of Radio and TV Marti.
   ``Rep. Fascell anticipated this and has already cautioned the
administration that they'd better be prepared for this type of
action.''
   But it may instead have just been a rare combination of
technical difficulties and inopportune weather conditions, said Jay
Newman, vice president and manager at CBS-owned WCIX.
   His station experienced a power outage and briefly was off the
air Monday night when the Cuban signal appeared.
   ``We believe it was a unique combination of circumstance, us
going off the air, and of the wether being such that the signal
from Cuba was able to bounce full-strength onto our frequency,''
Newman said.
   Channel 3 carried a variety show and the Cuban government's
national news program Saturday.
   Angel Pino, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, would not confirm or deny the jamming was a warning
from Cuba.
   Cuban Foreign Ministry officials have suggested that if TV Marti
goes into operation, their government might retaliate by beaming TV
programs to the United States, even if the signal interfered with
American stations.
   The Reagan administration began considering TV Marti after
seeing the success of Radio Marti, which broadcasts news,
editorials and entertainment to Cuba under the auspices of the
Voice of America. Both are named after Cuban independence hero Jose
Marti.
   The TV Marti section of the annual House authorization bill is
based on a Senate version passed last year that provided $7.5
million for starting costs and a study to determine whether TV
Marti is viable.
   The study, released in January, endorsed TV Marti but cautioned
that Castro's ability to retaliate be weighed closely before
proceeding.

<TEXT>
   The Nassau County Police Department has
begun random drug testing in certain narcotics squads, making it
one of the first departments in the nation to test officers for
drug use.
   Officers who fail the test will be fired, and officers who
refuse to take it also may be dismissed. The program was announced
to the 200 officers in the drug-fighting squads this week and is
effective immediately.
   The policy follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision which last
month upheld the right of the U.S. Customs Service to randomly test
employees who work on drug interdiction even without reasonable
suspicion an officer has used drugs.
   Harry Greenberg, attorney for the Police Benevolent Association
in Nassau County, said the union has not decided whether to
challenge Nassau's new policy.
   The program is designed to make the public and officers
confident of an officer's integrity, Commissioner Samuel Rozzi said.
   He noted that the officers assigned to the drug units, including
undercover agents and police lab workers, have ready access to
drugs.
   ``Almost all of our officers are above reproach _ the finest in
the country,'' said Rozzi, whose department on Long Island numbers
3,200. ``We want to be able to weed out the one or two who are
not.''
   For 15 years, the Nassau County department has drug-screened
applicants, officers during their first year of probation, and
those under suspicion of drug use. Since 1983, nine officers and
two civilian employees have been fired for illegal drug use. Six of
the officers were charged with crimes.
   In New York City, random testing for drugs was started last
October among the approximately 1,000 officers assigned to the
Organized Crime Control Bureau.
   Boston, Detroit, and Chattanooga, Tenn., are awaiting court
rulings on drug detection programs being fought by their police
unions.
   In 1986, the Maryland State Police implemented a random
mandatory testing program for all its members. The program was
suspended after eight months when the state attorney general
advised that it may be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
   Miami officers asked that an annual mandatory drug screening
exam be written into their contracts.

<HEAD>Legislature Approves Waiting Period for Gun Purchase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland lawmakers have ratified a bill
requiring background checks and a seven-day waiting period for
buyers of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons.
   The bill, prompted by January's schoolyard shooting in
California and by an upswing in street violence involving
semiautomatic weapons, was approved late Monday in the closing
hours of the 1989 General Assembly session.
   The measure still must be signed by Gov. William Donald
Schaefer, whose support is expected.
   Under the legislation, state police would check the background
of a prospective gun buyer before a sale could be completed. The
sale would be canceled if police found evidence that the applicant
was a drug addict, alcoholic, convicted felon or was mentally
deranged.
   Purchases of 24 specific gun models are affected, and those who
violate the law would be subject to prison terms of up to three
years and maximum fines of $10,000.
   Earlier in the 90-day session, some legislators proposed banning
the sale of semiautomatics altogether, but later modified the
measure in the face of overwhelming resistance.
   In 1988, Maryland passed a bill eliminating cheap handguns known
as Saturday Night Specials. The measure established a nine-member
board to decide which guns may be manufactured and sold in the
state.
   Gun control opponents spent $6 million in a losing effort to
defeat that bill. Continued pressure from the National Rifle
Association has kept lawmakers leery of further weapons legislation.
   However, lawmakers around the nation have felt pressure to
control the spread of semiautomatic weapons, particularly after
January's schoolyard tragedy in Stockton, Calif., where a gunman
killed five children and wounded 30 other people in a rapid burst
of gunfire from an AK-47.

   About 200 prison inmates took eight guards
hostage Tuesday but released them at the end of the day and
returned quietly to their cells, authorities said.
   Officials assured the inmates no force would be used against
them and granted their demand that a prison court review the case
of an inmate who was put in an isolation cell Monday, said
Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, director of administration at Poissy prison.
   The inmates, who were not armed, took six guards hostage at
noon, and two more guards voluntarily joined their collegues. Six
guards were freed unharmed at about 8 p.m. and the other two an
hour later.
   Prison officials, four inmates and representatives of the
Justice Ministry negotiated through the afternoon and evening.
   About five hours into the revolt, riot police took up positions
around the main buildings of the prison, which is 23 miles west of
Paris and holds about 450 long-term prisoners.
   Last November, 250 inmates at Poissy occupied the central hall
for 13 hours to protest ``bad conditions of detention,'' then
returned peacefully to their cells.

   A barge carrying a nuclear reactor
vessel resumed its trip up the Columbia River on Tuesday after a
fire aborad the tugboat pulling it caused a seven-hour delay.
   The fire broke out in the engine room about 3:30 a.m., when the
tug and the barge were just above Bonneville Dam, east of Portland.
The reactor vessel from Shippingport, Pa., is on the last leg of an
8,000-mile voyage to burial at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear
reservation.
   There were no injuries and ``at no time was there any danger of
the reactor vessel going aground,'' said Wendy Anderson of the
Knappton Corp. in Portland, which owns the tug.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Guy Nolan said another tug was sent from
Portland and the barge Paul Bunyan got under way again about 10:45
a.m.
   It was not clear what caused the fire aboard the tug Clarkston,
Nolan said. ``We had a report that there were a few burned wires or
something,'' he said.
   The barge passed Portland's north edge Tuesday just after
midnight, as about 100 anti-nuclear activists protested on the
Interstate Bridge over the river.
   Coast Guard vessels have escorted the barge since it entered the
Columbia at Astoria Monday morning.
   The 1,000-ton reactor pressure vessel is expected to arrive
Wednesday at the Hanford nuclear reservation.
   The vessel, which is 45 feet high and 18 feet across, traveled
through the Panama Canal en route from Shippingport, Pa., where the
nuclear plant was shut down in 1982.
   Built of 6-inch-thick stainless steel, the vessel was emptied of
its uranium fuel and the U.S. Department of Energy said it is no
threat to public health.

   Priests on Tuesday granted asylum to
two survivors of a shooting by authorities and warned democracy and
justice are endangered in the country.
   The two men sought asylum, citing death threats following a
military court decision last week to free 19 police and soldiers
involved in the killing of 14 other Venezuelan fishermen on Oct. 29.
   The Rev. Oswaldo Santana told reporters that Jose Arias and
Wolmer Pinilla went to the Vatican diplomatic mission late Monday,
and were moved to a Roman Catholic church in the eastern slums of
Caracas, where they will receive ``unconditional protection.''
   Santana, the church's human rights vicar, said they are
depending on the sanctity of the church to keep the men safe.
   Arias and Pinilla said they survived the October shooting by
jumping in a river and swimming to safety. They later sought asylum
in Mexico, while a lower military court ruled them guilty of
``military rebellion.''
   In January, the military court declared Arias and Pinilla
innocent and ordered the arrest of the 19. This followed a
congressional investigation that declared the 14 dead men were
murdered and the military brigade had tried to cover up their
actions by accusing the fishermen of being Colombian guerrillas.
   The highest rung of the military justice system last week
declared the lower military court had lacked authority, and freed
the 19 lawmen on a legal technicality.
   A socialist congressman who supported the survivors, Walter
Marquez, called the decision a ``legal prison break.''
   Since the men were freed, Marquez said he, Arias and Pinilla,
have got numerous anonymous telephone calls threatening their
lives. Local reporters following the case also reported receiving
death threats.
   ``This situation is extremely grave, not only for the lives of
the two men, but also for the correct administration of justice,''
Rev. Santana told reporters.
   The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots in
Caracas and elsewhere in which news reports said at least one
person was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups and
human rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to the
government.
   Also Tuesday, the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference of ``grave
dangers'' facing democracy. They said Venezuelans have lost faith
in the administration of justice and their political leadership.
   In a document, the bishops called on corrupt Venezuelan
politicians and businessmen to return billions of dollars illegally
siphoned from the country in the last 10 years.
   In February, government-imposed price increases prompted riots
that left at least 270 dead by official count. Unofficial sources
say that death toll was as high as 2,000.

   Police arrested hundreds of people and were
seizing tens of thousands of hunting rifles from Soviet Georgians
in an attempt to calm the republic, which on Tuesday mourned 19
people killed in a pro-independence rally.
   Tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers patrolled the
streets of the southern republic's capital, Tbilisi, to enforce a
ban on public gatherings and an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, apparently signaling a tough
Kremlin response to any more outbursts of nationalist feeling,
expressed his resolve to oppose ``extremism, anti-Soviet displays
and the destructive actions of adventurist elements.''
   Gorbachev's comments at a meeting with Hans-Jochen Vogel, the
head of West Germany's Social Democratic Party, were carried by the
Soviet news agency Tass.
   Gorbachev said he considered it a ``sacred'' principle that
Georgians and others should have the right to express their
opinions freely, but said the law set limits on their actions,
Hans-Vogel reported after the meeting.
   ``The question of state power is nothing to be trifled with or
taken lightly,'' Vogel quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   Reports indicated a general strike that began Friday to back
demands for Georgia's secession was easing. Some buses and trolleys
resumed routes Tuesday, and police who accompanied the vehicles on
their rounds were beaten, Tass said. It said many schools also
remained closed by boycotts.
   Tuesday was declared a day of mourning to mark what the Georgian
Communist Party leader, Djhumber Patiashvili, called ``a common
grief'' _ the deaths of civilians killed in a clash Sunday with
soldiers and police at the pro-independence demonstration.
   Cars and trolleys were adorned with black flags and people wore
black clothes and ribbons, said Nana Natadze, wife of a Georgian
nationalist activist.
   ``Everything is black,'' she said in a telephone interview from
the city of 1.2 million people, 900 miles south of Moscow.
``Everyone's suffering.''
   Georgian radio and TV canceled regular programs to play dirges
and report news, said Nanuli Gogua, another Tbilisi resident whose
daughter, Irina Sarishvili, was among a half-dozen Georgian
activists arrested over the weekend.
   All entertainment activities were called off, Tass reported.
   About 200 people were arrested for violating the curfew, and
police were confiscating 66,000 registered hunting rifles from the
public temporarily, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told reporters Tuesday, without giving a reason.
   The government daily Izvestia said 464 people were arrested for
curfew violations.
   Dr. David Lazarishvili, an anesthesiologist at the Central
Republican Hospital in Tbilisi, said a 32-year-old man died Tuesday
morning of injuries suffered in Sunday's clash. He said that
brought the death toll from the confrontation to at least 19,
although he said he heard unconfirmed reports of as many as 50
deaths.
   Gerasimov said at a news briefing Tuesday his latest information
put the death toll at 18, and 120 civilians and 75 police and
soldiers injured. Tass said more than 200 were hurt.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said one woman died of
``traumatic shock'' and 12 people were crushed to death. He said
the causes of the other deaths were undetermined.
   In a report on the TV news program Vremya, Patiashvili said no
one expected fatalities when troops armed with clubs and shields
were ordered to clear demonstrators from Tbilisi's main street.
   ``After the troops started to act, they (the demonstrators)
didn't retreat. And then the unpredictable happened,'' he said.
``The troops didn't back off, and unfortunately, innocent people
who were not active participants in the demonstration died.''
   ``Unfortunately,'' he added, ``the leaders immediately fled, and
not one of them was scratched.''
   ``It happened, and we share a common grief,'' the Georgian party
leader said.
   Gerasimov said all factories were working but some not at full
capacity because ``some women decided to stay home with their
children.'' Public transport, he said, was operating at ``almost
normal levels.''
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian, was
sent to his home republic to help quell the unrest.
   The foreign minister met with a crowd on a street and had a
``heated but at the same time substantive dialogue,'' Gerasimov
said without elaborating.
   While serving as Georgian party chief from 1972-1985,
Shevardnadze called for tolerance between Georgians and ethnic
Abkhazians, a minority living in the western part of the republic.
In 1978, he supported nationalists on a law making Georgian the
republic's official language.
   Demontrations in the southern province, where former Soviet
leader Josef Stalin was born, began April 4. Protesters had
attacked calls from some Abkhazians to break away from the republic
because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Others demanded
that Georgia secede from the Soviet Union because of alleged
interference by the central government in their political, economic
and cultural affairs.

   Nearly 25,000 children in military families
nationwide are on waiting lists for child care despite Department
of Defense efforts to expand its child care program, according to a
study released Tuesday.
   The survey, conducted by the General Accounting Office, found
that military child care facilities are providing day care for
about 62,000 children, an 82 percent increase over the end of the
1984 fiscal year.
   Two types of care are available to families living on Air Force,
Navy, Army and Marine Corps bases _ child development centers,
provided in government-built and subsidized facilities by trained
care givers; and family day care homes, usually provided in
government housing by non-military spouses.
   The survey of 200 military installations in the continental
United States found that child development centers have the
capacity to care for more than 38,500 children, while 4,557 day
care homes can care for as many as 23,417 children. Eighty percent
of the remaining 24,729 children, who are on waiting lists, need
full-day care.
   The survey, by the congressional watchdog agency, had no
information on nationwide spending for military child care.
Worldwide, however, operating costs for child care centers totaled
$101.6 million in fiscal 1985, including $31.4 million in federally
appropriated funds, the report said. By fiscal 1987, federal
spending had increased 39 percent, to $43.6 million out of a total
cost of $134.3 million, the survey said.
   If the program is to continue to grow, many child care centers
need to be renovated or built, the GAO said.
   Military parents' child care needs are complicated by the fact
that they often work unusual hours, can't rely on extended family
for help and, because of frequent moves, don't have the support of
an established neighborhood, according to the report.

   The conviction of four Puerto Rican
nationalists in the $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery could
revitalize the independence movement in Puerto Rico, a professor
who has written a book about the case said Tuesday.
   ``It's going to provide a tremendous stimulous,'' said Ronald
Fernandez, a sociology professor at Central Connecticut State
University in New Britain.
   Five defendants were accused of being members of Los Macheteros,
a militant group seeking Puerto Rican independence. The group has
been linked to terrorist attacks on U.S. military installations on
the Carribean island.
   Fernandez, who wrote ``Los Macheteros'' about the case, compared
their cases to that of Lt. Col. Oliver North, on trial in the
Iran-Contra case.
   ``Oliver North was clearly engaged in revolutionary activity,
clearly used violence and allegedly used illegal means. But a large
number of Americans perceive him to be a hero, a patriot and are
willing to look the other way. It's the same thing for the
Macheteros in Puerto Rico,'' he said. ``A portion of the population
regards them as patriots and regard this a terribly unjust thing.''
   Juan E. Segarra Palmer III, 39; Antonio Camacho Negron, 45;
Norman Ramirez Talavera, 32; and Roberto Maldonado Rivera, 53, were
convicted Monday at U.S. District Court in Hartford, ending a trial
that began Oct. 11, 1988.
   Segarra was found guilty on robbery, conspiracy and
transportation of stolen money charges, but innocent on four
weapons-related charges. He's being held without bond and faces up
to 165 years in prison.
   Camacho's bond was revoked and he faces up to 15 years in
prison, while the others face up to five years behind bars. No
sentencing date was set.
   A fifth defendant, Carlos Ayes Suarez, 29, an anthropology
student, was the only defendant found innocent. He had faced a
conspiracy charge stemming from the Sept. 12, 1983, heist of about
900 pounds in cash from the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford.
   Fernandez said the defendants should have been tried in a
different location by an Hispanic jury.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. didn't immediately return
telephone calls to his office in New Haven.
   Throughout pre-trial proceedings, defense attorneys tried
unsuccessfully to have the trial moved to Puerto Rico. U.S.
District Judge T. Emmet Clarie refused.
   ``It clearly proves that Puerto Rican patriots cannot get a fair
trail in the United States, and that's the reason they brought it
to Hartford in the first place,'' said defense attorney Ronald L.
Kuby of New York City.
   Kuby represents Luis Alfredo Colon Osorio, one of nine other
defendants awaiting trial. The second trial has been delayed while
prosecutors appeal Clarie's decision to suppress wiretap evidence.
   Kuby and other attorneys for the defendants awaiting trial said
Tuesday a second trial might not be held if Clarie's wiretap ruling
is upheld because of the money and time it would take to prosecute.
But if a second trial is held, they said they would renew their
efforts to move it out of Hartford.
   ``The only place it's conceivable to get a fair trial is in
Puerto Rico,'' said Richard J. Harvey, an attorney from New York
City.
   Harvey represents Filiberto Ojeda Rios, who the government
considers a leader of Los Macheteros. Ojeda is jailed in Puerto
Rico on charges of shooting an FBI agent when authorities raided
Ojeda's house and arrested him in 1985 in connection with the
robbery.

   The military, criticized for
killing two reporters last month, said Tuesday it will not fire on
journalists' vehicles even if they ignore or inadvertently run a
roadblock.
   Two reporters were killed and another seriously wounded in March
by soldiers manning roadblocks. The incidents are being
investigated, but the armed forces have acknowledged that in at
least one of the cases the soldier fired without provocation.
   In another development, President Jose Napoleon Duarte returned
to his duties at the Presidential Palace after five days of
convalescence from side effects of cancer treatment.
   A document containing instructions on military relations with
the press was signed Tuesday by Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides
Casanova. It says that if a news vehicle passes through a
roadblock, soldiers manning the position ``will limit themselves to
taking down the license plate number, to be reported to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, which will take appropriate action. Under no
circumstances will the vehicles or their occupants be fired upon.''
   Security force roadblocks are common in zones where fighting is
heaviest in this Central American country, ravaged by nine years of
civil war between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed government.
   News vehicles are identified by the local convention of
affixing, with tape, the large letters ``TV'' on the windshield,
sides, roof and back. They also fly small white flags out windows
or from antennae.
   The document, to be distributed in the form of an order to
military units nationwide, also prohibits the arrest of accredited
journalists discovered in battle zones without a safe-conduct
document from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Such passes are required for access to regions of frequent
fighting. Journalists who have entered such areas without the pass
have been arrested. The new regulation authorizes local commanders
only to take down the violator's name and affiliation, for relay to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which would administer any sanction.
   The new document also prohibits confiscation of equipment, film
or written material under any circumstances. Military authorities
in the past have temporarily impounded or confiscated such
material, prompting protests from the local correspondents'
association.
   ``We feel it is our obligation to establish regulations that, in
addition to improving our relationship with the media, allow both
of us to carry out our missions in the best possible manner,'' said
the document.
   Duarte's secretary Carmen Vallejos said the president met with
several ministers and other officials when he resumed his duties.
In a telephone interview, she described his mood as ``animated.''
   Duate, a 63-year-old Christian Democrat, is dying of liver
cancer. Chemotherapy intended to slow the advance of the disease
provoked severe nausea and vomiting last week. Duarte became
dehydrated and was confined to bed for intravenous feeding. He
temporarily delegated the presidency to Vice President Rodolfo
Castillo Claramount.
   Duarte's five-year term ends June 1, when he is to hand power
over to President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance. Cristiani was elected March 19.

<HEAD>Family Of Irish Hostage Appeals For His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother and sisters of Irish hostage
Brian Keenan appealed for his release Tuesday on the third
anniversary of his abduction in Moslem west Beirut.
   Keenan, 38, an English-language teacher at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. No group has
claimed responsibility for his abduction.
   ``We, the family of Brian Keenan who is today held hostage for
three years, want to appeal to those who are holding him for some
news about his well-being,'' Keenan's family said in a statement.
   An Arabic-language translation of the statement was published by
the independent daily An-Nahar and leftist As-Safir.
   ``We again appeal to those holding our dear son and brother
Brian to release him and let him go in peace,'' the statement said.
It was signed by Keenan's mother, identified only Mrs. Keenan, and
his sisters Brenda Gilham and Elaine Spence.
   Ms. Spence said Tuesday that Keenan came within 10 minutes of
being released in January before something mysteriously went wrong.
   ``Our hopes were highest in January and we now know that Brian
was 10 minutes away from being released,'' Mrs. Spence said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``He was clean shaven.
He had fresh clothes. His hair was cut and he was ready for release.
   ``We don't know what went wrong and we still don't know what
happened,'' she said. She did not indicate the source of the
family's information.
   Keenan has dual British and Irish citizenship.
   In addition to Keenan, 14 more foreign hostages in Lebanon
believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran. They include
nine Americans, three Britons, one Italian and one Belgian.
   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March
16, 1985 in Beirut.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers whose revolt was crushed
by loyal troops over the weekend have begun returning to duty after
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's military government promised not to punish
them.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic church radio station, said more
than 230 of the Dessalines Barracks' 750 soldiers had reported to
army headquarters by Tuesday morning.
   Foreign Minister Serge Elie Charles said Monday no rebels were
being held prisoner. The government has said they will be treated
``with dignity'' and no reprisals will be taken.
   Two gunmen identified as Dessalines deserters hijacked a
twin-engine airplane Monday that was carrying missionaries based in
Redlands, Calif., from Haiti to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The hijackers diverted the plane to Miami and surrendered. The
seven other passsengers and the pilot were not harmed.
   Avril's 1,100-man Presidential Guard based at the National
Palace stormed the adjoining Dessalines barracks Saturday to put
down a rebellion among soldiers demanding that the general give up
the presidency.
   Fighting began Friday night and lasted 20 hours. Avril told
reporters Monday most of the cartridges used initially were blanks,
in order to reduce casualties.
   He said the Saturday assault with live ammunition occurred after
mortar shells from the Dessalines Barracks landed near the palace,
killing three soldiers.
   Five soldiers were killed in the two days of fighting, and a
sixth died Sunday while trying to recover an unexploded grenade,
Avril said. He also reported one civilian killed and 43 soldiers
and 32 civilians wounded.
   It remained unclear whether Avril would disband the Dessalines,
widely regarded as the most repressive unit in Haiti's 7,000-man
army.
   Col. Guy Francois, its former commander, was said to have been
given temporary asylum in the Vatica Embassy. The government has
identified Francois as one of four leaders of a coup attempt April
2.
   Negotiations continued between the government and the 414-member
Leopards Battalion, the other unit that rebelled last week. Lt.
Col. Himmler Rebu, the commander, was deported after being named as
a conspirator in the coup attempt.
   Avril said 12 Leopards had not returned to their base, but the
battalion had accepted government authority.
   ``Everything is on the way to the re-establishment of order,''
Adjutant Gen. Andrei Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.

   Oliver North defended his efforts for the
Nicaraguan Contras Tuesday, testifying at his trial that he knew a
pivotal letter his boss sent Congress on the subject was false but
regarded it as a ``political problem,'' not a fraud.
   ``Did any moral bells go off in your head?'' asked prosecutor
John Keker.
   ``It wouldn't be proper to describe it as a moral bell,'' North
said, and then he turned his focus to the cut-off of U.S. Contra
aid that led to his secret efforts.
   ``I thought it was extraordinarily immoral to have put a force
in the field, to have fed it, armed it, equipped it and then leave
it in the lurch,'' said North. ``It was heinous. I happened to be
right smack dab in the middle of it.''
   All through his fourth day as a witness at his Iran-Contra
trial, North defended his honor as well as his efforts on behalf of
the Nicaraguan rebels, meeting a fusillade of suggestions from
Keker that he violated the code he was taught at the Naval Academy.
   Keker accused North of telling ``a flat-out, 100 percent,
old-fashioned, All-American lie'' when he was instrumental in
getting President Reagan to send thank-you notes to a fund-raiser
and a major donor to the Contras. Keker read from a document which
quoted North as giving an assurance the two were ``not involved in
raising private funds for the Contras.''
   Other questioning concerned a letter sent by National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane on Sept. 5, 1985, to Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. That
letter, denying news accounts that the National Security Council
staff was soliciting donations and offering tactical advice to the
Contras, is at the heart of several charges concerning lying to or
obstructing Congress.
   ``I recognized it to be false because I had gone to some lengths
since 1984 to get his (McFarlane's) approval for and keep him
apprised of what I was doing,'' North said of the letter. ``It
denied the things he sent me off to do.''
   Didn't he see the letter as a fraud on Congress? the prosecutor
asked.
   ``To me a fraud means to break the law. I did not recognize it
as breaking the law. I recognized it more as an increasing
political problem,'' North replied.
   But, he said, ``I'm not proud of this.... I didn't think it was
unlawful, but I didn't think it was right.''
   He said he had urged McFarlane to assert executive privilege and
refuse to reply to Hamilton and, failing in that argument, attached
``talking points'' to McFarlane's draft to discuss before the
letter went out.
   Asked why his insistence on executive privilege did not show up
in attached notes, North said by that point he felt he had lost the
argument.
   ``What is not in the notes is anything about fund-raising,''
said Keker.
   ``Surely, he and the president had done it,'' North said. ``He
(McFarlane) had authorized me to go to the Taiwanese; I had
arranged for the Peoples Republic of China to get missiles; he knew
I had arranged air drops of weapons and intelligence and recoilless
rifles (to the Contras.) He knew all of these things, none of which
was in those letters.''
   ``I believe McFarlane's letter was false to the point of being
deceptive,'' North said.
   Keker asked North about a recommendation, approved and forwarded
by McFarlane, that Reagan sign thank-you notes to fund-raiser Carl
Channell and to Barbara Newington who had contributed $250,000. A
document introduced by Keker said White House counsel Fred Fielding
approved the recommendation on grounds that North had said neither
had been involved in fund-raising.
   Keker characterized that assertion as ``a flat-out, 100 percent,
old-fashioned, All-American lie.''
   North said he barely knew Fielding.
   ``At the U.S. Naval Academy you would have been kicked out for
this?'' Keker asked at one point in connection with North's role in
drafting the McFarlane letter to Congress.
   ``In the U.S. Naval Academy nobody taught me to run a covert
operation,'' North retorted. Nor about ``political warfare going on
in Washington in 1983-1986.''
   On another matter, North denied he tried to help his associate,
Richard Secord, make a half million dollars by renting a ship to
the CIA, which turned out not to be interested in the offer.
   During a 1984-1986 congressional ban on military aid to the
rebels, North had enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras, an
operation which the government alleges turned millions of dollars
in profits for Secord, a retired Air Force major general.
   Keker has been trying to draw a connection between Secord's
profits and favors done for North. For example, one charge against
North is that he illegally accepted a $13,800 home security system
paid for by Secord.
   ``At the Naval Academy you were taught falsehood included
deception?'' asked Keker of the witness, a Marine lieutenant
colonel until he resigned in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``You were also trained to obey all lawful orders,?'' asked
Keker, underlining the word lawful on a large pad on an easel
facing the jury.
   ``Did you take courses in that and learn what was meant by
lawful and unlawful ... you were trained and taught that it was a
crime when in World War II at the end of the war German officers
came and said they were ordered to do it?''
   Said North: ``I don't believe I have ever received an unlawful
order.''

<HEAD>New Fusion Experiments Still Leave Many Questions On Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite two tests that seem to confirm part of
a Utah cold nuclear fusion experiment, experts said Tuesday that
more questions need to be answered before most scientists accept
there has been a breakthrough.
   ``We're all mystified by this and watching it,'' said Dale M.
Meade, head of fusion reaction research at Princeton niversity.
``It's the scientific way to be skeptical. That process is still
going on.''
   Meade and others said the experiments announced Monday at Texas
A&amp;M and Georgia Tech did shed some light on what University of Utah
officials claim is a demonstration of fusion at room temperature.
   But most experts remain unconvinced that fusion has actually
taken place and some suggest the phenomenon may be something new to
science.
   ``They (Utah researchers) have taken the position that it was a
fusion reaction,'' said John Soures, a University of Rochester
fusion scientist. ``But that has yet to proven.''
   ``I think this whole thing may go down as one of the most
bizarre episodes in 20th century science,'' he added.
   In an announcement two weeks ago, Stanley Pons of the University
of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southhampton in
England said they had achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory
equipment at room temperature.
   Their experiment used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum
immersed in a beaker of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen commonly
found in seawater. Pons said that when electrical power was applied
to the coil for about 100 hours, it forced deuterium atoms into the
palladium until they finally fused, producing energy in the form of
heat.
   Pons claimed the device made four watts of energy for every watt
of energy used.
   Fusion has been the goal of thousands of scientists around the
world for more than a quarter century. It is the energy secret of
the stars, the sun, and the reaction that gives the boom to the
hydrogen bomb.
   If the reaction could be controlled, scientists believe it could
be the ultimate energy source, giving virtually limitless
electrical power using a cheap fuel extracted from sea water and
producing only modest amounts of radiation hazard.
   In fusion, hydrogen atoms are forced together. As they fuse,
they give off energy, neutrons and helium-3, a stable chemical.
Fusion is the opposite of fission, the nuclear reaction that splits
the atomic nucleus. Fission is the force that powers atomic power
plants and nuclear bombs.
   At Texas A&amp;M, scientists said Monday an apparatus similar to the
Utah experiment did produce some excess energy, but the reaction
was so small that their equipment was not sensitive enough to
detect the flow of neutrons, a characteristic of fusion.
   A&amp;M's Charles Martin said his group could have come from some
``unusual chemical process'' and not from nuclear fusion. This
possibility, he said, is being investigated.
   A similar experiment at Georgia Tech did produce neutrons,
causing researcher Bill Livesay to announce, ``There's no question
it's fusion. I still don't believe it, even though I see it.''
   The Georgia Tech experiment began producing neutron particles
and probes measured a flow of about 560 neutrons an hour above the
background radiation.
   However, Georgia Tech's James Mahaffey said the team did not
confirm that the experiment produced more energy than it used.
   Meade said fusion cannot be confirmed until more laboratories
have conducted the experiment and made precise measurements of both
the heat production and the flow of neutrons. He said the rise in
neutrons and in heat should ``track'' each other, that is, show by
measurement to be directly related.
   ``It is not enough to just see some heat there and the hint of a
few neutrons,'' said Meade. ``We need to be able to relate this
energy to some process that would produce it.''
   He said the amount of energy reported in the Utah experiment
would develop trillions of neutrons a second, and if the Texas and
Georgia experiments matched the energy output, they, too, would
have high neutron flow.
   ``They are missing billions of neutrons per second,'' said
Meade. ``They hypothize that is may a different type of nuclear
reaction than we have known. Physics experts around the world are
trying to come up with some nuclear reaction that we haven't seen
before. It possible, but not very probable.''
   Both Meade and Soures said the energy surge seen in the
experiment may be created by a ``battery effect.''
   ``It takes weeks for the energy output to get up to the reported
levels,'' said Soures. ``This suggests that it's operating more
like a battery than fusion.''
   He said the device could be storing the electrical energy put
into the experiment and then discharging the power as heat when it
becomes satuated.
   Tom Dolan of the Department of Energy laboratory in Idaho Falls,
Idaho, said that a good explanation of the Utah experiment will not
be developed until more experiments are conducted and the
fundamental process is finally understood.
   ``Sometimes, these things could drag on for months before they
are resolved,'' he said. `` But right now, I don't think it is a
breakthrough that will be useful.''

   Drug czar Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,
believed to be the biggest cocaine dealer in Mexico, was charged
Tuesday with possession, trafficking and transportation of illegal
drugs.
   ``I don't know why they connect me with the cocaine business,''
he said in the 10th District Court after the charges were read. ``I
have never had that type of dealings.''
   The court is located inside the Southern Prison on the outskirts
of Mexico City. Felix Gallardo stood behind bars during the
proceeding.
   He was asked if he used drugs and he replied, ``Yes,
sporadically, but I'm not an addict.''
   Felix Gallardo was moved under heavy guard before dawn from the
Attorney General's office where he had been held since his arrest
Saturday in Guadalajara.
   Nine others arrested in the investigation, including several of
Felix Gallardo's aides and the chief federal anti-drug official and
five other ranking police officers in Sinaloa state, were jailed in
Mexico City's Northern Prison.
   Authorities on Monday seized some of Felix Gallardo's assets,
including a hotel, pharmacy, real-estate company, bank accounts and
other properties. No value was placed on the assets, but his net
worth is estimated to exceed $500 million.
   He was asked in court how much he earned. He said he could not
say.
   Judge Amado Guerrero Alvardo said the charges against Felix
Gallardo carry a sentence of seven to 15 years.
   The judge has three days to decide whether to issue an
indictment and then a year to review the evidence and present the
verdict.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo on Monday called
Felix Gallardo ``the No. 1 drug trafficker in Mexico.''
   In the northwestern state of Sinaloa, judicial police patrolled
the residential zones in Felix Gallardo's hometown of Culiacan,
especially the districts where he owned property.
   Felix Gallardo, 43, was taken to the 10th District Court on the
basis of a warrant the court issued for him in 1986 after the
arrest of Hugo Devere Becerra.
   Parts of the 500-page court document read to Felix Gallardo were
based on testimony by Devere Becerra, who allegedly was Felix
Gallardo's partner for a year or two beginning in 1983.
   Devere Becerra also has been linked to other drug traffickers,
including Rafael Caro Quintero, who was arrested in the 1985
slaying of American DEA agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Caro Quintero was sentenced in September 1988 to 34 years in
prison after being convicted on drug-related charges. He has not
been tried in the abduction, torture and killing of Camarena
Salazar. That case is in a court in the western city of Guadalajara.
   During Tuesday's hearing, Felix Gallardo denied knowing Devere
Becerra or at least four other reputed narcotics kingpins. He was
not asked about Caro Quintero.
   Alvarez del Castillo said Monday his office had no evidence
linking Felix Gallardo directly to the killing of Camarena Salazar,
but he said he was the ``intellectual author'' of the organization
that murdered the agent.
   Felix Gallardo was asked by the court what he did between March
and December of 1984 _ the period covered by Devere Becerra's
depositions.
   He said, ``During this period I was only dedicated to my hotel
business, and a concession for sales of building, along with
various businesses in which I'm up to date on tax payments.''
   He gave his profession as a businessman, said he was married and
had four children and had attended junior high school. He also said
he was a native of Culiacan and lived in Guadalajara.
   Felix Gallardo denied testimony in the court record that he used
several airplanes, including his own $1.5 million Aerocommander, to
transport drugs from South America to various parts of Mexico and
sometimes across the border to the United States.

<HEAD>Government Bank Subsidizes Loan Against Foreign Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's Export-Import Bank, which has
been borrowing money at more than 9 per cent interest, announced
Tuesday it is making a $17 million loan to the firm of Babcock and
Wilcox at 6.5 percent.
   Most loans by the bank go to other countries to encourage them
to buy U.S. goods, but the bank also is authorized to lend to
American companies to help them compete for business at home
against subsidized loans from other governments.
   Babcock and Wilcox will use the money to install a heat recovery
boiler at a Gaylord Container Corp. paper mill at Bogalusa, La. The
loan is for eight years, with repayment beginning in July 1990.
   The loan was announced after the government determined that the
Brazilian government had offered a 6.5 percent ``noncompetitive''
loan to Gotaverken, a joint venture of Brazilian and Swedish
companies. The U.S. bank matched the offer.
   Ann Frey, public information officer at the bank, said,
``Babcock and Wilcox employees will build the equipment in the
United States. We're supporting American jobs and not Brazilian
jobs.''
   A noncompetitive loan by an official agency needs a subsidy from
taxpayers to make up the difference between the higher interest
rate that the government has to pay for the money it borrows and
the lower-cost financing it offers to the private company.
   Last time the U.S. bank itself borrowed money it had to pay 9.34
percent.

   The Senate Small Business Committee voted on
Tuesday for the nomination of Susan S. Engeleiter to be chief of
the Small Business Administration, five months after she lost a bid
for the U.S. Senate.
   By a unanimous voice vote, the panel sent the nomination to the
full Senate, where her formal confirmation is expected as early as
next week.
   The Small Business Administration was persistently targeted for
elimination by former President Reagan as part of his deficit
reduction efforts. But Engeleiter, 37, told the lawmakers that the
agency's ``future is bright'' under President Bush.
   ``President Bush fully appreciates the importance of small
business to the American economy, and the importance of the Small
Business Administration to small businesses,'' she said in her
opening remarks.
   Engeleiter, the Wisconsin State Senate Republican leader, was
defeated in November by Democrat Herbert H. Kohl in the race for
the U.S. Senate seat vacated by William Proxmire, who retired.
   Her selection to head the Small Business Administration was
supported by several business groups, including National Small
Business United, the National Federation of Independent Business,
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. She would be the first woman to
head the agency.

<HEAD>Police Quiz Nurses Aid Who Gave Early Tip on 49 ``Mercy Deaths''

<TEXT>
   A nurse's aide who reported a suspicious
death at a hospital last year was questioned Tuesday by police
investigating four other nurse's aides who confessed to what they
described as 49 ``mercy killings.''
   All the patients at Lainz Hospital were elderly _ 75 years or
older _ and were killed over the past six years with overdoses of
medicine or by water forced into their lungs. Police said they
doubted the claim of mercy killing because of the methods used.
   One investigator said the nurse's aides also admitted to killing
patients they considered a nuisance.
   After a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
spoke of the case as ``the most brutal and gruesome crime in
Austria's history.''
   The killings prompted Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk to evoke Nazi
medical experiments at Auschwitz and other death camps.
   ``The death angels of Lainz remind me of the death angels of
Auschwitz,'' Zilk said during a televised debate late Monday.
   Nurse's aides Maria Gruber, 25; Irene Leidolf, 27; Waltraud
Wagner, 30, and Stephanie Mayer, 50, are in custody, but no charges
have been filed. Three were arrested Friday and one Sunday.
   Police said Ms. Wagner admitted killing 39 patients, 22 of them
by forcing water into their lungs, and Ms. Mayer to killing five
patients, one with water.
   A fifth nurse's aide, Chilean-born Dorah Eugenie
Ferrada-Avendano, was on vacation when a warrant for her arrest was
issued, and she went to police Tuesday for questioning.
   Authorities said they doubted she was involved and speculated
the other four implicated her because she reported her suspicions
last year.
   The first deaths in the ward _ which has come to be known as
``The Death Pavilion'' _ occurred in 1983, but most were committed
in the last two years, police said.
   Max Edelbacher, a senior police investigator, said Tuesday that
questioning of nursing personnel substantiated the assumption of
``knowledge and suspicion'' about the crimes committed at the
hospital's First Medical Department. He said police got the
impression staff members did not take rumors about the deaths
seriously.
   Edelbacher told The Associated Press the total of patients
killed will probably rise above 49 with further investigation.
   As aides, the women were supposed to wash and feed patients, but
not to give injections, according to hospital officials.
   Austrian radio said Ms. Ferrada-Avendano told police she knew of
one murder and told a doctor about it.
   But Edelbacher said she knew of killings at the hospital two or
three years before she first mentioned her suspicion last year.
   He said that as a single woman coming from abroad and having to
look after a son, she was under constraint that made it hard for
her to approach authorities.
   Police Chief Guenter Boegl has said the overdoses administered
were insulin or tranquilizers.
   Police sources said aides plugged the noses of at least 23
victims and pumped water into their lungs. Investigators said each
nurse knew the others were killing patients, and in some cases two
nurses would act together.
   An unidentified man, confirming a newspaper interview, told
Austrian TV he saw Waltraud Wagner administer sleeping medication
to a 86-year-old male patient who died hours later. The man refused
to face the camera or give his name.
   Franz Pesendorfer, who heads the department where the murders
occurred, said he and his doctors could not have known about the
mass slayings because the crimes were committed in a secret and
sophisticated way.
   Edelbacher said police met ``a wall of silence'' when they tried
to get the name of the doctor said to have been told about
suspicious events in the ward.
   Zilk read a police statement that said the doctor, when finally
identified, refused to name his informant.
   The mayor appointed a commission to consider possible negligence
at the hospital, Vienna's fourth largest.

<TEXT>
   Grace Jones, the flamboyant singer and
film actress, was freed from jail Tuesday after a court granted her
bail on a charge of possessing cocaine.
   Magistrate Carol Lawrence-Beswick freed the Jamaica-born Ms.
Jones on $2,700 bail on condition she returns for trial June 6.
   Ms. Jones, 36, who became a movie star in the James Bond film
``A View to a Kill,'' sat on a prisoner's bench, occasionally
conferring with her lawyer. She was not asked to enter a plea.
   Her lawyer, Tom Tavares-Finson, told the court the entertainer
is not a drug user, and is involved in the campaign against drug
abuse.
   Spectators packed the small courtroom. A crowd of about 200
gathered outside the courthouse, and some shouted support as she
left.
   Ms. Jones had been held in a police station cell since Saturday,
when police charge they found 0.006 ounces of cocaine wrapped in
two $2 Jamaican bills in her purse. If convicted, she probably will
be fined rather than jailed because of the small quantity of the
narcotic involved, court observers said.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Clerk of Court Alicia Jones opposed bail,
saying the actress would not be inclined to return for trial
because of her business obligations.
   But Tavares-Finson said it was because of recording and
advertising contracts that Ms. Jones wants to stand trial so she
can be cleared of the charge.
   Ms. Jones was arrested after police raided the Music Mountain
Recording Studio in the Kingston suburb of Stony Hill, which also
doubles as the home of her husband, record producer Chris Stanley.
   According to the prosecution, the entertainer was in a bedroom
when police approached. Police searched her handbag and allegedly
found a small quantity of cocaine wrapped in a $2 bill. At the
Stony Hill police station later, police searched her bag again and
found more cocaine wrapped in another $2 bill, the prosecution
alleged.
   Ms. Jones, who has been called the ``high priestess of
androgyny,'' is known for her crewcut and bizarre stage acts.
   She grew up in Syracuse, N.Y., and studied acting before
becoming a model in Manhattan. She appeared on the covers of Vogue
and Elle magazines. She now lives in Los Angeles and New York.
   As a singer, Ms. Jones capitalized on the disco boom. Her most
recent album, ``No Compromise,'' produced by Stanley, is scheduled
to come out in June.

   Bishop William H. Keeler was named Tuesday as
the 14th archbishop of the nation's oldeset archdiocese.
   ``I am honored and deeply grateful to our Holy Father for this
assignment,'' Keeler, 58, said at a news conference. ``I pledge to
Pope John Paul my loyalty, and I know that I have his support.''
   He will be installed May 23, succeeding Archbishop William D.
Borders, 75, who retired. Borders will continue to serve as
administrative leader of the archdiocese until Keeler's
installation.
   Keeler of Harrisburg, Pa., said he was both bewildered and
humbled.
   ``Bewildered because of my human limitations and also because it
meant leaving the Diocese of Harrisburg, where I have been as a
priest and bishop for so many years,'' he said.
   ``Humbled because of the new and heavier responsiblities and
because of a long line of great archbishops here,'' Keeler said.
   Keeler is considered a conservative. He has taken stances
against cohabitation, premarital sex, abortion and capital
punishment.
   Borders had a reputation as a liberal, supporting an increased
role for women and the laity in the church and opposing U.S. aid to
the government in El Salvador.
   In taking over the oldest archdiocese in the United States,
which observes its bicentennial this fall, Keeler will confront
such challenges as the alarming decrease in the number of Catholic
priests and nuns.
   Following church tradition, Pope John Paul II chose the new
archbishop after a secretive selection process in which the pontiff
considered the recommendations of U.S. bishops, the Vatican
ambassador to the United States and Vatican officials.

<TEXT>
   Princess Anne had a brief reunion Tuesday with her
husband of 15 years while a royal aide the tabloids say is
``besotted'' with her remained on duty behind the walls of Windsor
Castle.
   All three kept silent on the questions that grip Britain's
mass-circulation newspapers: Is the marriage of the queen's only
daughter in trouble, and is Timothy Laurence, the royal aide who
wrote four letters to her, the other man in her life?
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on reports that Laurence, a
handsome 34-year-old bachelor who is a Royal Navy commander, had
offered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
   It said only that the theft of the four letters delivered to The
Sun, Britain's largest-circulation tabloid, was under investigation
by Scotland Yard.
   In a front-page story Tuesday, The Sun quoted unidentified
friends of Laurence as saying he ``is besotted with Princess Anne
and believes she loves him too.''
   Under the banner headline ``Tim `So In Love With Anne','' the
rival Daily Mirror quoted other unidentified friends as saying they
have had long telephone chats at night and have met secretly at a
house in the country.
   Rumors have circulated since 1981 of trouble in the marriage of
Princess Anne, 38, and Mark Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and
former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards. They were brought
together by their love of horses but have led increasingly separate
lives, spending about half of 1988 apart.
   On Sunday and Monday, the princess and Phillips had separate
schedules and did not see each other, then had only a brief reunion
in the early hours of Tuesday.
   She arrived at their Gatcombe Park estate in western England
after midnight Monday and went horseback riding at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
By the time she returned three hours later, Phillips was gone.
   His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said he was ``somewhere in
Spain.''
   His father, Maj. Peter Phillips, said his son was advising
people who wanted to set up an equestrian center in Spain.
   ``There is no question of him running away,'' said the senior
Phillips, 68. ``One is getting rather fed up with all the
speculation. They have been getting along for the last 10 years
without any problems.''
   Anne kept public engagements in London later Tuesday, including
visits to research projects related to multiple sclerosis and
muscular dystrophy at the National Hospital's Institute of
Neurology.
   Laurence was on duty at Windsor as an equerry, or aide, to the
queen.
   The Sun, which told Scotland Yard it would not reveal the
contents of the letters, quoted one of Laurence's friends Tuesday
as saying:
   ``Obviously, Tim and the princess were physically attracted to
each other, but their friendship goes deeper than that. Tim has
apparently filled a loneliness in her life and given her a shoulder
to cry on when she needed someone to tell her troubles to.
   ``He understands her tantrums and the bad publicity she often
attracts. But most of all, he cares for her in the way she believes
her husband does not.''
   There is royal precedent for divorce. The queen's only sister,
Princess Margaret, divorced Lord Snowden in 1978 and he has
remarried.
   Because Anne is seventh in line to the throne and unlikely to
become queen, a divorce would not threaten the monarchy.

   Retired Supreme Court Justice Willard Estey said
Tuesday he will not hear new testimony in reviewing the disputed
investigation of a 1985 Gander, Newfoundland, airplane crash that
killed 256 Americans
   ``I'm giving a legal opinion; I'm not holding a hearing,'' Estey
said in a phone interview from his office in Toronto. ``I'm sitting
here reading tons of evidence.''
   Estey agreed last month to review a three-year investigation by
the Canadian Aviation Safety Board and deliver a report in 90 days
on whether it was adequate or if further investigation or even a
new inquiry is warranted.
   A letter from Estey to a transportation official, published
Tuesday by the Ottawa Citizen, rejected requests that he hear new
testimony.
   Estey said he had no direct comment on the Citizen's report, but
remarked that the terms of reference for his 90-day review were to
decide if a new hearing is needed and not to hold one now.
   The safety board's report on Canada's worst air disaster was
released in December after internal disputes that often went public.
   Five of the nine members approved the report saying the probable
cause of the Dec. 12, 1985, crash was ice on the wings of the Arrow
Air charter DC-8.
   Four members released a minority report saying an in-flight fire
or explosion was the most likely cause.
   The plane carrying U.S. soldiers from Middle East peacekeeping
duties to Fort Campbell, Ky., crashed shortly after taking off from
a refueling stop at Gander. Killed were 248 U.S. servicemen and
eight crew.
   According to the letter obtained by the Citizen, Estey decided
to base his review on existing records of the crash investigation.
   This upset some members of the safety board and families of
crash victims, who hoped Estey would let them testify on why they
believe a full-scale judicial inquiry into the disaster is
warranted.
   In an April 5 letter to a Transport Canada official, the Ottawa
Citizen reported, Estey wrote he had heard some safety board
members planned to submit new information.
   ``If I were to entertain submissions from board members, I
believe that that would be both improper in law and would oblige me
to hear submissions from all interested parties on an equal
footing,'' it quoted the letter as saying.
   Transportation Minister Benoit Bouchard named Estey to review
the investigation last month.
   Theresa Griffin, widow of pilot John Griffin, wrote Estey last
week asking to testify. She is among those trying to clear the name
of Griffin, indirectly blamed for the accident by not having the
plane de-iced before takeoff.
   ``This is not going to be an impartial review,'' said Jerry
Rusinowitz, a Griffin supporter. ``The fact that we are being
excluded is intentional. It's part of the game plan. It's a
cover-up.''

   A French official, declining to be named publicly, said that
Dumas and other French leaders are seeking the support of the

<HEAD>GOP Lawmakers Introduce Child-Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican legislators on Tuesday introduced a
child-care bill that would offer a tax credit to low- and
moderate-income families who care for small children at home as
well as those who send their children to day-care facilities.
   ``We're going to use the tax code of this country to put dollars
in pockets of parents,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chief
sponsor of the bill in the Senate. ``We're not going to
discriminate if they want to put their children in day care
centers, they're going to have money to pay for it ... and
essentially we're not going to discriminate if in these families
the mother or father chooses not to work.''
   The proposal recognizes ``every family has different
circumstances,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa, the bill's chief
House sponsor.
   Republicans said their bill is an alternative to the Act for
Better Child Care (ABC) bill that has been revived by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   They said their bill would serve more families, give the money
directly to parents and not day-care providers, allow state and
local governments and not the federal government to set day-care
standards and not restrict eligibility to child care in
center-based facilities.
   ``The tax credit approach is not a child care bill,'' responded
Dodd spokesman Jason Isaacson. He said the $1,000 credit proposed
by the GOP would cover just one-third of the average annual $3,000
child care costs families face.
   ``To propose child-care legislation and to dismiss the question
of quality ... is to say that if you live in a state that has tough
health and safety standards, congratulations, and if you live in a
state that does not ... tough luck,'' said Isaacson.
   Republicans, including then-presidential candidate George Bush,
were critical of the Democrats' version of the bill in the past
Congress.
   Current tax law provides tax savings up to $720 annually per
child for a maximum of two children to help offset some expenses
required for parents to get or keep a job.
   Domenici said the GOP initiative would help the majority of the
nation's families whose children he said were not served in
day-care center settings but were in home-based facilities.
   ``We now know that only about 12 percent of the children that
we're talking about today are taken care of in child-care
centers,'' Domenici said. ``Eighty-eight percent of them are taken
care of either at home by their parents; they're taken care of by
relatives, they're in home-based kinds of day-care facilities so we
think that we ought to help the 88 percent.''
   The bill, called the Child Care Assistance Act of 1989 would:
   _ Provide a $1,000 refundable tax credit for the first child
under age five and $500 each for up to two additional children.
   _ Expand the current dependent care block grants authorization
to states to $300 million annually.
   _ Offer a 10 percent tax credit to employers for spending on
dependent care assistance programs made available to employees.
   _ Establish a $75 million fund to assist states in establishing
insurance liability pools to which any accredited child-care
provider may belong.
   _ Authorize $25 million in revolving loan funds which
family-based day-care providers could tap to help them make capital
improvements to meet accreditation requirements.
   The GOP lawmakers said $3 billion in potential tax revenues
would be foregone during the first year of the bill, but they
expected those revenues to be replaced. They did not say how that
would happen.

<TEXT>
   Papua New Guinea, facing a revolt on
the remote island of Bougainville, has asked Australia to provide
emergency medical aid to its troops after two were killed in
weekend ambushes, the Australian government said Tuesday.
   The request for helicopters for rapid medical evacuation came
after two soldiers were shot dead Sunday, apparently by militant
landowners, bringing the death toll from in recent violence to six.
   The local landowners are opposed to foreign-controlled mining
operations. Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu of Papua New Guinea said
it appeared they were equipped with weapons from overseas.
   Kim Beazley, Australia's defense minister, said Papua New Guinea
made the request because Sunday's violence marked the first time
its troops were killed in action.
   An aide to the Australian Defense Ministry, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Australia expects to respond favorably
to the request.
   Papua New Guinea, with a 3.5 million mainly Melanesian
population, is just north of Australia. It gained independence from
Australia in 1975.
   Namaliu did not give details of the clashes, but said: ``If it
is established that foreign elements have been involved, we will
pursue these criminals. This is truly a sad event in the nation's
history.''
   Tensions have been high on Bougainville for months after local
landowners objected to profits being made from the island's copper
mine, which ranks among the world's 10 biggest open cut mines.
   Last year, local landowners demanded the equivalent of $4
billion in compensation for mining operations and mounted a series
of sabotage attacks that temporarily suspended mining operations.
   Local landowners also object to the presence of immigrant tribal
highlanders who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s and have formed a
large community, depriving many locals of employment.
   A spate of recent murders between the two groups has fueled the
unrest.
   Australia's biggest mining company, CRA Ltd., jointly operates
the Bougainville Copper mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of
the mainland.
   The Papua New Guinea government also issued ``shoot-to-kill''
orders if further violence erupts, the Australian Associated Press
said.

<TEXT>
   The center-right government of Premier
Turgut Ozal, whose party suffered defeat in local elections last
month, won a vote of confidence in Parliament on Tuesday, 289 to 95.
   The 57 members of the centrist True Path Party boycotted the
vote in the one-house, 450-seat Parliament. The chief opposition,
the Social Democrat Populist Party, voted against the government.
   Ozal's Motherland Party has an overwhelming majority in the
legislature.
   After the setback in local polling, Ozal overhauled his Cabinet
and then sought the confidence vote.
   About 300,000 workers meanwhile joined a campaign of passive
resistance called by Turk-Is, the nation's largest labor union
confederation, to protest what it said were low incomes at a time
of high inflation.
   The protest includes a work slowdown, a boycott of
company-provided luncheons, the growing of beards, a refusal to
work overtime, and going for hospital visits en masse, said Turk-Is
spokesman Erkin Okay.
   Turk-Is President Sevket Yilmaz, whose federation has 1.8
million members, said on Tuesday that the campaign was prompted by
deadlock in contract negotiations for more than 600,000 workers
employed by state agencies such as sugar factories, the Electricity
Authority and State Highways Department.
   In March 26 local elections, Motherland won only 22 percent of
the vote nationwide and trailed both the Social Democrat and True
Path parties.
   Ozal has vowed to stay on until his term ends in 1992, but many
in his own party concede that early elections are inevitable and
say Ozal wants to delay the voting until 1990.
   He apparently hopes to win voter support if given more time to
lower inflation, which reached 75 percent last year.

<TEXT>
   A House banking panel voted Tuesday to gut the
key reform of the Bush administration's savings and loan proposal,
but then rolled back in several follow-up votes on some of the
changes that most weakened the plan.
   By a 24-23 vote, the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions diluted a requirement to force S&amp;L owners to back
loans with more of their own capital.
   The original weakening amendment, sponsored by Reps. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., and Stan Parris, R-Va., provided a much looser
definition of what constitutes capital by including such balance
sheet items as goodwill, subordinated debt, deferred loan losses
and mortgage servicing rights.
   Then, the subcommittee partly retightened the definition of
capital regarding subordinated debt and deferred loan losses in
subsequent votes of 28-19 and 26-21, respectively.
   However, the bill, as written so far, still would allow
institutions failing to meet the standard to grow by about 7
percent to 8 percent a year. The administration wants to bar
capital-deficient thrifts from expanding.
   ``We've come back some, but we're still concerned that we not
have fictional capital,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary David W.
Mullins said after the votes.
   ``There are still problems. It is still not as good as the Bush
bill, but a small group of Democrats got George Bush his ...
capital standards,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has
been supporting the administration position.
   The subcommittee, with sessions scheduled Wednesday and
Thursday, still faced long hours drafting other provisions of the
bill, but members agreed the capital standards were the central
reform accompanying President Bush's proposal to spend $50 billion
to close or merge failed S&amp;Ls.
   In the original vote to gut the provision, seven Republicans
joined 17 Democrats in supporting the change. They were opposed by
11 Democrats and 12 Republicans.
   ``It really, really guts this bill. ... I would have to say it
surrenders to the'' U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the
industry's chief lobby group, said Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, told panel members before the vote that
``we ought to have a little backbone'' and said Bush would veto any
legislation with weak capital standards.
   ``This amendment embraces one more time smoke-and-mirrors
accounting and smoke-and-mirrors capital,'' said Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee, which will
review the version of the bill that eventually passes the
subcommittee.
   Bush wants to increase S&amp;L capital requirements by June 1991
from 3 percent of assets to 6 percent, contending that the more
capital S&amp;L owners have at risk, the less likely they will be to
take undue risks and the greater the buffer standing in front of
the government deposit insurance fund.
   Parris said his amendment, worked out over the weekend by aides
to committee members, was ``absolutely not overgenerous to
thrifts.'' He argued that if each element of the capital standards
was separately debated, the end result would be an even weaker
bill. However, so far, the individual votes have gone in the other
direction.
   Annunzio said 1,091 solvent S&amp;Ls, more than a third of the
industry, would fail to meet the administration's capital rules and
would not be allowed to grow.
   ``In reality that is a death sentence,'' he said, adding, ``It
must be pointed out that these 1,100 savings and loan institutions
are not the bad guys. ... Rather, for the most part, these are
institutions scattered throughout the country that were primarily
engaged in home lending.''
   Earlier, the subcommittee adopted, 30-17, a separate weakening
amendment offered by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
   The administration wants to encourage S&amp;Ls to get out of areas
such as direct investment in real estate, insurance and junk bonds
by requiring owners to back those investments entirely with their
own capital. McCollum's amendment exempts healthy thrifts already
engaged in those businesses from the stricter standard.
   The panel also approved, on a 35-7 vote, a proposal by Rep. Doug
Barnard, D-Ga., that would protect holding companies that bought
sick S&amp;Ls last year with the promise of government aid from having
to absorb the costs if those institutions fail because the
assistance is cut off.
   Barnard said the measure was aimed at preventing other S&amp;Ls
under a holding company's umbrella from also failing because of a
government failure to live up to the aid agreements.
   Gonzalez complained that the amendment would create a large
loophole for holding companies to skirt any liability if the
once-failed thrifts go under again.
   In other decisions, the subcommittee:
   _Rejected, 31-14, an amendment by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., proposing a sweeping change in accounting standards.
Kennedy would force banks and S&amp;Ls to value loans at their market
price, rather than at their original worth. The change would have
drastically altered the balance sheets of big banks with shaky
loans to Third World countries.
   _Rebuffed on a voice vote an attempt Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,
to get states with high numbers of state-chartered thrift failures,
such as Texas, California and Florida, to help pay for the bailout.
   _Protected the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from political
interference by extending, on a voice vote, the terms of board
members to eight years and the terms of the chairman and vice
chairman to five years.

<HEAD>Military Vows To Intervene Again If `Institutional Order' Disrupted</HEAD>
<UNK>By EVA VERGARA ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile's military, preparing to surrender
power after 16 years of authoritarian rule, has vowed to intervene
again if an elected civilian government does not maintain the
present ``institutional order.''
   That warning was issued by President Augusto Pinochet, the army
commander, and the chief of the military academy of strategic
studies.
   Pinochet led the coup that ousted the elected government of
Marxist President Salvador Allende in September 1973. In October,
voters rejected a military proposal to extend Pinochet's term until
1997. An open presidential election now is scheduled for Dec. 14
with the winner to take office next March 11.
   The 73-year-old Pinochet, speaking Monday night in southern
Chile, said the armed forces must ``guard the constitutional
order.''
   ``That obliges us to make sure, without hesitation, that the
sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years
destroyed,'' he said. ``We will continue to work to ensure that
those seeking political power are authentic democrats, who defend
the model of a free society.''
   Army Gen. Alejandro Medina, commander of the military academy,
delivered a stronger message Monday to hundreds of non-commissioned
officers.
   ``If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have
the duty to restore it, using ... all the necessary means,'' he
said.
   Medina said civilians must understand ``the role of the armed
forces,'' and that role is not one of a policeman watching the
country ``but to support the reign of law and the institutional
order.''
   Opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the
institutional order based on a 1980 constitution approved in a
referendum.
   Opponents have centered their criticism on two issues: A
constitutional article that allows Pinochet and the heads of the
other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998, and the
creation of a military-dominated National Security Council to
``represent'' its views on crucial matters.
   No significant progress has been reported in negotiations
between the government and opposition on possible constitutional
changes.
   Pinochet authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow
changes in key articles.
   The army issued a communique Monday denouncing criticism of
Pinochet and saying the army considered such criticism ``as
addressed to each and all members of our institution.''
   Genaro Arriagada, vice president of the Christian Democratic
Party, the largest opposition party, responded.
   ``Pinochet is a politician and, as such, he is subject to
criticism for his work and his public comments,'' he said. ``Even
the army's high command is subject to criticism by the citizens.''
   He said the continuation of Pinochet as army commander under a
future civilian government ``is tantamount to establishing an armed
state within an unarmed democratic state.''

   The Bush administration is trying to prod the Israelis and
Palestinians into an improved atmosphere of relations that could

   Shamir has proposed elections by Palestinians living in the

<HEAD>California Water Program Renewed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department, faced with a
long-running fight over central California water, announced the
renewal Tuesday of a long-term contract to supply water to farmers
despite objections from environmentalists.
   But Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. directed that an
environmental assessment of the lease renewal be done and he
suggested that state officials and other interested groups could
solve any environmental problems.
   While the lease only involves the Orange Cove Irrigation
District in the San Joaquin Valley, the action is likely to set a
precedent for other central California irrigation projects which
serve farmers who also rely on the delivery of federal water
through an elaborate system of dams and canals.
   Environmentalists have opposed a renewal of the long-term leases
because they argue the leases lock the government into supplying a
certain volume of water well into the next century at a time when
rapid population growth also is putting new demands on non-farming
water needs.
   As water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban
use, streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands, which support
migratory waterfowl, will disappear, the critics maintain.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the Interior
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, sharply
criticized the decision to resume renewing the leases at a time
when there are uncertainties about their environmental impact.
   ``This decision further corrodes the environmental credentials
of the Bush administration,'' Miller said.
   Randall Block, an attorney who represents several environmental
groups that have challenged the lease renewals, said, ``It's kind
of backward to sign the leases and then order an environmental
assessment.''
   The Friant Unit of the Central Valley Project, as the huge
irrigation system is called, receives 1.5 million acre-feet of
water a year from Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, providing water
for both large and small farms and orchards.
   The decision to renew the lease came as different agencies of
the Bush administration also continued to disagree sharply on
whether new California water contracts running 40 years should be
issued without resolving all their potential environmental
ramifications.
   After the Interior Department indicated last November that it
planned to renew the 40-year leases without first developing formal
environmental impact statements, the Environmental Protection
Agency challenged the leases, elevating the matter to the White
House.
   More than a dozen environmental groups also protested and the
Natural Resources Defense Council filed suit in California arguing
that another 40-year water commitment is such a significant act
that it requires a formal environmental assessment under the
National Environmental Policy Act.
   A federal judge recently said, in response to the suit, the
leases could be issued, but he reserved the right to void any such
lease, depending on the outcome of the government debate over
environmental issues.
   The president's Council on Environmental Quality has scheduled
meetings in Washington and California on Thursday and Monday to
gather information on the environmental issues surrounding the
lease renewal controversy.
   While the presidential council has no authority to block the
leases or order environmental assessments, its opinions on such
matters historically have carried considerable weight among federal
agencies and in Congress.
   In a statement, Lujan said the department action on the Orange
Cove lease renewal should not have an impact on the CEQ
proceedings. He said he has ordered the head of the Bureau of
Reclamation to proceed with an environmental assessment of
continuing water deliveries to the massive Central Valley Project,
of which Orange Cove is only a small part.
   ``The renewal of long-term water supply contracts may pose
legitimate environmental concerns,'' said Lujan, adding that the
assessment he ordered should be ``considered by the state and
(local) districts as they adopt environmentally sensitive operating
procedures and water policies.''
   ``That is essentially different than doing an EIS (environmental
impact statement under federal law),'' suggested Richard Sanderson,
director of the office of federal activities at the Environmental
Protection Agency. He said Interior officials are essentially
``sidestepping'' the National Environmental Policy Act in the
procedures being used to consider the environmental issues.
   ``Our position (at EPA) is the entire water issue for California
needs to be reviewed in light of today's environmental standards
and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence,''
said Sanderson in an interview.
   Lujan said the lease renewal would encourage increased water
conservation among the farmers by charging ``substantially higher
prices'' for the water. Uder the new contract with Orange Cove, the
cost of federal water would quadruple from $3.50 to $14.94 per acre
foot, he said.
   An acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land
one foot deep, or about 350,000 gallons.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's decision to stop jamming
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty presents an unparalled
opportunity to spread American ideals and policies in Eastern
Europe, an official said Tuesday in seeking new money for the
U.S.-operated networks.
   Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the publishing magnate and chairman of
the Board for International Broadcasting, told a Senate
subcommittee that the greatest challenge for RFE@RL is to respond
to the end to jamming despite severe budget constraints.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new policy of
openness has placed the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ``at a
crossroads of history.''
   Soviet jamming stopped late last year, making the mission of
RFE@RL ``more important than at any time in its nearly 40-year
history,'' Forbes said. ``The United States can affect the nature
and direction of reforms in the East bloc by ensuring that all
citizens of the region have access to the full range of information
necessary for making intelligent political decisions.''
   The Board for International Broadcasting, an independent federal
agency that oversees RFE@RL, is seeking a $425.2 million
appropriation in fiscal 1990 to beam its broadcasts into the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.
   More than 55 percent of that amount _ $234.8 million _ is a
one-time expense to complete modernization of RFE@RL's transmitting
system.
   About $207 million will go to build a new relay station in
Israel, with the rest to be the final installment on a refurbishing
program for existing relay stations that began in 1985.
   ``Funding of BIB modernization needs is critical in fiscal year
1990,'' said Pat Schlueter, the agency's financial manager. ``This
is very important for the Israeli relay station, so the major
contracts can be let in 1990.''
   The relay station will be used jointly by RFE@RL and Voice of
America, the radio network operated by the U.S. Information Agency,
and will increase the stations signals by 300 percent in Central
Asia beginning in 1992, Forbes said.
   Marvin L. Stone, acting director of USIA, proposed a 1990
appropriation of $949.2 million at the hearing before a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee.
   Stone said the budget request is a $66.9 million increase over
this year, but that losses in funds from the State Department and
other cost increases will mean an actual cutback in USIA's
operating funds.
   He said USIA will be forced to cut back VOA's Greek and Turkish
language broadcasts, close some relay stations and overseas posts
and cut staff.
   House and Senate appropriations subcommittees have been
supportive of the budget requests, but ``neither have made any
promises,'' said an agency official who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The USIA budget does not call for any money for the
controversial TV Marti project, which is to beam VOA broadcasts to
Cuba. But Stone said USIA is negotiating with the Office of
Management and Budget for a 1990 budget amendment for TV Marti.
   USIA's 1989 appropriation included $7.5 million in startup funds
for TV Marti, which faces strong opposition from U.S. broadcasters
who fear it will interfere with their TV signals.
   A presidential commission in January questioned TV Marti's
legality and technical feasibility.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who is chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, has opposed TV Marti, particularly in
light of the Soviet decision to stop jamming U.S. broadcasts in
Eastern Europe.
   The House is expected to vote on new TV Marti funding Wednesday.

<HEAD>Shamir Adviser Charged With Accepting Bribes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was
indicted Tuesday on charges of accepting bribes in land deals in
the occupied West Bank, and Israel radio said the money was passed
to Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   A Tel Aviv district court accused Michael Dekel, a former deputy
minister of agriculture, of soliciting $233,000 in bribes from land
developers in return for help in obtaining government permits for
buying land in the West Bank.
   The indictment said Dekel began demanding the money in April
1984, after national elections were announced, and that Dekel's
assistant, Avi Tzur, passed the money to the Likud and other
organizations linked to the political bloc.
   The elections, held in July 1984, ended in a stalemate between
the Likud and the left-leaning Labor Party, and the two formed a
joint unity government.
   Prosecutor Rachel Shiber said Dekel received money from at least
four land dealers.
   Dekel, now Shamir's adviser on settlements in the occupied
lands, was charged with soliciting and accepting bribes, breach of
confidence and conspiracy. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years
in prison if convicted.
   As deputy agriculture minister for settlement affairs from
August 1981 to October 1984, Dekel was instrumental in involving
private entrepreneurs in projects for building Jewish settlements
in the West Bank.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 130 settlements
among 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.

   Two House panels gave unusually routine

voice-vote approval to the package, which is expected to come
before the full House on Thursday.
   The money is to keep up the flow of food, clothing and medicine
to the roughly 11,000 rebel fighters encamped in Honduras along the
Nicaraguan border through February of next year, when the leftist
Sandinista regime has promised to hold national elections.
   It may be used, as well, to support ``voluntary reintegration''
of the rebels into Nicaraguan political life, assuming promised
electoral and media reforms are made by the Sandinista government.
   Under the agreement announced March 24 at the White House, the
money may be cut off if the rebels engage in human rights abuses or
in offensive military action.
   The bill would require no new money, instead transferring the
aid funds from various Pentagon accounts.
   Later Tuesday, a companion bill providing the $49.7 million in
Contra money was introduced in the Senate and put on track for
swift passage.
   The measure, offered by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
and Minority Leader Robert Dole, was referred immediately to the
Appropriations and Foreign Relations committees, the latter of
which planned a hearing Wednesday.
   Dole, R-Kan., said he was working with Mitchell on a time
agreement for debating the plan and said he hoped the floor debate
could come Thursday.
   ``This legislation is the result of a great many hours of work
by members on both sides of the aisle,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Dole said he wished there was sentiment in the Congress to
approve military aid to the Contras but conceded: ``The votes
aren't there.''
   Dole then applauded Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III for striking the deal for humanitarian aid for the Contras,
saying the United States needed to ``remain a player'' in Central
America in case Nicaragua's Sandinista government reneges on
commitments to democratic reforms.
   ``I'm not under any illusions that Danny Ortega is suddenly
going to be a good boy in Central America,'' Dole said, referring
to the Nicaraguan president.

   A helicopter being used to work on a high-rise
building crashed Tuesday morning near the Lake Michigan shore, but
the pilot escaped serious injury, authorities said.
   Ben Moore, 43, of Elmhurst, Ill., was taken to the Milwaukee
County Medical Complex, where he was treated for cuts to the leg
and face, said hospital spokeswoman Pam Hansen.
   The helicopter went down around 10:25 a.m. next to the U.S.
Coast Guard Station on Milwaukee's south side.
   A Milwaukee Fire Department dispatcher said the crash occurred
as the pilot was trying to remove an air-conditioning unit from the
top of a 25-story condominium.
   A homemade videotape showed the helicopter going out of control
suddenly while lowering the air conditioning unit.
   Bill Bruce, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board, said he reviewed the videotape and concluded that the
helicopter lost power to the tail rotor. Bruce gave the pilot
credit for avoiding the building once he lost control.
   ``He did the best he could with it and brought it down,'' he
said.
   Ray Seaberg, a Coast Guard seaman, said he was watching the
helicopter work when the vehicle's tail rotor hit the building and
the aircraft went into a spin. Seaberg and others helped pull the
pilot from the helicopter.
   Lt. Keith Cameron of the Coast Guard estimated about 20 gallons
of fuel leaked into the lake, but he said workers had the spill
contained and were cleaning it from the water.

<HEAD>Open Letter Asks Bush To Lift Trade Embargo Against Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An open letter signed by about 600
international artists, religious leaders and academics asks
President Bush not to interfere in Central American peace efforts.
   It also urged the United States to lift the trade embargo
against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and called on the
Bush administration to open talks with Nicaraguan leaders.
   Copies of the letter were released to journalists Tuesday by
President Daniel Ortega's press office. An aide said the letter
would be published in other countries.
   Among the signatories were Cuban dancer Alicia Alonso, Spanish
poet Rafael Alberti, American actor Ed Asner, Italian film director
Bernardo Bertolucci, Brazilian composer Chico Buarque de Holando
and American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked
about the letter, and he said: ``We want to continue to watch the
situation in Nicaragua, to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas for
change, to keep the pressure on them to live up to their promises.
We think there should be discussion between the parties involved.''
   He also said Secretary of State James A. Baker III has raised
the possibility of incentives to the Sandinistas if they make
reform efforts but added, ``We wouldn't want to speculate on what
that would be.''
   There have been reports in Washington of a possible easing of
the trade sanctions.
   The letter said the Central American nations should be allowed
to ``resolve on their own their own affairs, without any foreign
interference,'' and peace in Nicaragua ``must immediately be
re-established.''
   It said outside countries must support the accords reached by
the five Central American presidents Feb. 14 in El Salvador.
   The letter told Bush, ``This is the moment for you to restore
direct dialogue with Nicaragua.''
   There was no immediate response by Ortega to the letter.
   At the February summit Ortega promised to institute democratic
reforms and to hold elections in February 1990, 10 months earlier
than planned.
   In March his government freed nearly 2,000 former national
guardsmen imprisoned since the Sandinistas won a civil war against
the right-wing regime of President Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   Ortega and the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Honduras also agreed at the Februar meeting to produce by
mid-May a plan for dismantling the force of Nicaraguan rebels known
as Contras.
   An estimated 11,000 Contras have been living in border camps in
Honduras since the U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebels
in February 1988.
   Ortega has criticized the Bush administration's proposal to
provide up to $45 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras over
10 months.

<HEAD>April Chill Threatens Crops in the South</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures dipped below freezing Tuesday through much of the
nation east of Rockies and in the South, where farmers scurried to
save their crops. More than 40 cities reported record lows.
   The low of 29 degrees at Dallas-Fort Worth was a record April,
and lows of 31 degrees at Shreveport, La., and 26 at Hot Springs,
Ark., tied records for the month.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted Tuesday night for parts of
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, West
Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   Tennessee fruit growers assessed the damage from the cold snap
that apparently cut heavily into peach, plum and strawberry crops.
   The cold wave sent temperatures into the upper 20s in many parts
of the state and left behind dead or dying plums and peaches,
officials said. Apple and pear crops weathered better because they
had not yet bloomed as much as the peaches, plums and strawberries.
   In Alabama, a record low of 28 degrees had apple, peach and plum
farmers worried about their crops.
   In Indiana, many growers rushed Monday night to light smudge
pots and activate irrigation systems to save their crops as
overnight lows dipped to the 20s in much of the state.
   In North Carolina, a record-breaking springtime snow hit the
eastern part of the state early Tuesday, dusting streets and lawns
but causing few problems other than delayed school openings.
   Morning snowfall totals in northeastern North Carolina reached 5
inches in Camden County, with 4 inches in Currituck County. By
Tuesday afternoon, the snow had changed to rain or moved off the
coast.
   The Southwest basked in higher temperatures, with readings in
California and southern Arizona in the 80s and 90s.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies over much of the West and the Southeast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 93 degrees at
Needles, Calif. The nation's low for Tuesday was 9 degrees at
Yellowstone.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for snow showers scattered
across the Great Lakes; showers and thunderstorms in southern
Florida, the southern Plains and the southern Rockies; and sunny
skies over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s over much of
the nation; in the 40s from the upper Mississippi Valley to New
England; in the 70s across Louisiana and southern Texas; in the 70s
and lower 80s across the Florida peninsula; above 70 degrees across
Oregon, California, western Nevada and southern Arizona; and in the
80s and 90s in the California valleys and the Southwestern deserts.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan agreed Tuesday to permit more
U.N. checkpoints of military observers along the Afghan-Pakistan
border, where Kabul says illegal aid from Pakistan is flowing to
the Afghan rebels.
   Pakistani envoy Iqbal Akhund told the Security Council in
emergency session that Pakistan has agreed to provide a permanent
presence along the border to the U.N. Military Assistance Group For
Afghanistan and Pakistan, or UNGOMAP.
   This increased presence of U.N. military observers, now
numbering only 50, repeatedly was requested by Kabul and Moscow,
which allege Pakistan is violating U.N.-mediated agreements on
non-interference.
   Pakistan denies the charges, but its agreement on the additional
checkpoints is considered a minor concession. U.N. diplomats said
they did not think it would have a significant impact.
   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April 1988 calling for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Soviet troops entered
Afghanistan in 1979 to help the Marxist government fight
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, and 100,000 soldiers were in the
country before the withdrawal.
   Akhund, the prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs and
national security, said Pakistan has agreed to provide new border
checkpoints to UNGOMAP in border areas including Chaman, Parachinar
and Torkham, Nawa Pass. These are in the Northwest Frontier
Province and in Baluchistan.
   Earlier, Afghanistan urged the Security Council to take
immediate action to stop what it called Pakistan's ``full-fledged
war'' against Kabul and to stop intervention by the Pakistan army
and militia.
   Aside from more U.N. border checkpoints, it called for an
international conference on Afghanistan, a Security Council
fact-finding mission and U.S. and Soviet efforts to persuade
Pakistan to stop aid to rebels.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, appealing to the U.S. government,
said, ``The question is why the United States, a big world power,
becomes the tool for the implementation of Pakistani policies on
Afghanistan. Why should the strategic interests of the United
States be subdued to the expansionist designs of Pakistan in the
region?''
   Pakistan, which aids the Afghan rebels, denied all allegations
of interference, massing its troops and taking part in the battle
for Jalalabad, a key city in Afghanistan.
   The 15-member council was not expected to adopt any critical
resolution or take action on Afghanistan's complaint because the
United States, which backs Pakistan, would veto any action.
   It adjourned after speeches from Afghan and Pakistani envoys. No
further meeting was scheduled.
   The other permanent council members with veto power are Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, which arms
the Kabul government against the rebels, is president of the
Security Council this month.
   Despite the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February, the United
States and Pakistan continue to arm the Afghan guerrillas and the
Soviet Union continues to resupply the Kabul Army. Moscow says it
will halt its arms supplies if the United States does so, but the
rearming continues and efforts to seek a political settlement and
establish a broad-based government have faltered.
   The other council members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,
Ethipia, Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

   Hundreds of masked youths marched through the
Old City's narrow streets Tuesday, waving outlawed Palestinian
flags and carrying the coffin of a Palestinian killed by a Jewish
gunman the day before.
   One policeman fired tear gas and another fired rubber bullets at
stone throwers, wounding one in the leg, during the hourlong
procession. Police said they had detained three Jews ``suspected to
be linked to'' Monday's shooting, in which three other Palestinians
were wounded.
   When the mourners reached the Al Aqsa mosque compound, four
young men climbed to the mosque roof and raised a large Palestinian
flag while the crowd sang the Palestinian anthem ``Biladi, Biladi''
(My Homeland, My Homeland).
   On Monday, a man dressed in army fatigues opened fire with an
Uzi submachine gun near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the walled Old
City, killing Khaled Shawish, a 26-year-old blacksmith, and
wounding three companions.
   He fired from a distance of about five yards and escaped on foot
before police arrived.
   Police commander Yosef Yehudai said he believed the killer was a
reserve soldier.
   ``We seem to be speaking about an army reservist,'' he told
Israel television. ``There is a serious direction toward what I
would call nationalist motives,'' he told Israel television.
   Responsibility was claimed for an underground extremist group
named after the Sicarites, the Jewish assassins who fought the
Roman forces nearly 2,000 years ago. A man who said he spoke for
the Sicarites told Israel army radio they would increase attacks
``to improve the situation of Jews'' in the occupied lands.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which have a Palestinian population of 1.7 million.
   Most merchants in Arab east Jerusalem closed their shops in a
three-day strike to protest the shooting.
   At Shawish's house in a blind alley hung with two huge
Palestinian flags, dozens of angry young men raised more flags and
pictures of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   They chanted: ``Arafat, don't worry, we have people for you! God
is great!''
   Many wore improvised black masks or bags with eyeholes over
their heads. Others had wrapped their faces in checkered scarves
called keffiyehs.
   One masked protester told a journalist: ``The Israelis must
choose if they want peace or war. We are not afraid of them. We
want our state in the West Bank and Gaza with Jerusalem its
capital.''
   As the funeral marchers moved through the cobblestone streets,
their ranks grew to about 1,000. They circled the Al Aqsa complex,
a holy site of Islam that also houses the Dome of the Rock mosque,
from which the prophet Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven.
   Several of the young mourners attacked a nearby police station,
smashing windows and doors with their fists, legs and rocks. A
policeman responded with rubber bullets.
   Tension has increased in Jerusalem, home to 350,000 Jews and the
135,000 Palestinians of east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   A riot outside Al Aqsa on Friday spilled over into the area of
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine. The holy sites are on
Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Haram al Sharif, or Noble
Sancutary.
   Police retaliated by saying people who might riot, mainly young
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza, would not be
allowed to pray at Al Aqsa.
   In Tel Aviv, an Israeli teen-ager wounded two Gaza Strip youths
with a knife Tuesday, one of them seriously. The dispute apparently
began over a parking space, but police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said
the possibility of an ethnic motive was being investigated.
   A general strike virtually closed the Gaza Strip. The
fundamentalist movement Hamas (Zeal) urged it to protest Israel's
deportation of more than 40 Palestinians during the 16-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers firing on stone-throwers in
Gaza wounded nine Palestinians, including a 90-year-old woman
struck in the left leg.
   The army confirmed one of the wounded and said it was
investigating the other incidents.
   The uprising has taken the lives of 423 Palestinians and 18
Israelis.
   In Lod, Israel, a military court indicted two Palestinians on
charges of belonging to illegal organizations. The defendants were
identified as Saman Khouri,41, and Adnan Shalalda, 35, both of
Jerusalem. They were arrested March 5.
   The indictment accuses Khouri of being a member of the Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Shalalda of
belonging to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   It claims the two men prepared leaflets for the Palestine
Liberation Organization and its underground leaders of the uprising
in the occupied territories.
   Khouri, who worked as a correspondent for Agence France-Presse,
also was accused of receiving $1.5 million from a Palestinian
organization in Jordan and distributing it to PLO-affiliated groups
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

   Three Peace Corps volunteers were honored at
the White House by First Lady Barbara Bush Tuesday for their work
overseas in Mauritania, West Africa; the Phillippines and Ecuador.
   Mary Monique Slater, 27, St. Louis, Mo., Michael C. Bainum, 25,
San Antonio, Tex., and Charles Campbell Rhoades, 27, Arvada, Colo.,
were honored as the 1989 John F. Kennedy Volunteers of the Year.
   For the past four years, the Volunteer of the Year award has
been given to one volunteer in each of Peace Corps' three overseas
regions whose work and demeanor exemplify the agency's goal of
building peace and understanding through mutual development.
   Slater was chosen as an example of a majority of the agriculture
volunteers in Mauritania involved in reforestation, dune
stablization and the introduction of improved cooking stoves. She
represented volunteers serving in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost
half of all 6,000 volunteers serve.
   Bainum has worked to offset environmental degradation in the
Bicol National Park near his site in the Philippines through
community organization and education, particularly among young
people. He represented the more than 1,425 volunteers workin
nations in North Africa, the Near East, Asia and the Pacific.
   Rhoades is credited with producing change in the attitudes of
many Ecuadorian farmers and protecting remaining native forests
through plantings that will fulfill local forestry needs. He
represented the almost 2,000 Peace Corps volunteers in Central and
South America and the Caribbean.

<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday they had leads to the
youths who killed two people in a weekend drive-by shooting, and
community leaders were waiting for the bloody revenge they fear is
coming over the attack.
   Mayor Art Agnos, responding to the city's worst gang-related
murders in 14 years, hinted he may ask the National Guard to help
free police for temporarily increased patrols in the city's
drug-plagued southeast corner.
   The weekend shooting that left two dead and nine injured spurred
threats of revenge from a rival gang, including an ominous graffiti
warning that promised ``10 for one'' retaliation.
   ``It's really like a war zone here,'' said the Rev. Jim Goode of
St. Paul of the Shipwreck, a church inside the embattled
Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. ``That's the climate over here
right now.''
   Goode's church is about a mile from the corner where several men
armed with assault rifles and shotguns opened fire early Saturday
when they drove past a large crowd.
   The gunmen yelled ``Sunnydale'' before firing up to 60 shots
into the crowd and two parked cars loaded with young people.
   Police said none of those killed or injured are known to have
connections to the rival black teen-age gangs in Bayview-Hunters
Point and the Sunnydale project in nearby Visitacion Valley.
   The Sunnydale youths, who call themselves the Swampy Desert
Gang, and the Bayview-Hunters Point gang have been linked to more
than 30 shootings in the past year.
   Police said they had leads, but would not discuss any details in
connection with the attack, the worst gang incident since the 1975
Golden Dragon Massacre in Chinatown that left five dead and 11
injured.
   Police said the attack may have been Swampy Desert's retaliation
for the slaying of Edric Carr, 19, who was killed by a sniper on
Bayview-Hunters Point turf March 16.
   Gang tensions intensified when Carr's funeral was held in
Hunters Point. During the service, rival gang members angrily
taunted one another while police kept the two groups apart.
   City Supervisor Doris Ward said Tuesday that the weekend
shooting was more than just revenge by one gang against a rival.
She said it appeared one gang was intent on attacks on anyone from
their rival's neighborhood with no regard to gang affiliation.
   ``And that is different. That's scary. That's horrendous,
because we have never had that kind of behavior on that scale,''
said Ward, who's involved in a task force led by Goode which seeks
to ease local tensions.
   Ward believes crack cocaine is at the root of all the violence
and gang battles plaguing southeast San Francisco and other urban
areas.
   ``It's a vicious, vicious circle and one causes the other and
it's a whole domino effect,'' said Ward, who also blasted the
availability of assault rifles.
   Goode's task force held a community meeting Monday night that
attracted 125 parents, community leaders and youths to discuss gang
problems and possible solutions.
   One of the ideas presented, Goode said, was formation of a
community youth and family discussion group to resolve the
communication gap he sees between parents and their children.
   ``I think that that's one of the things that we are trying to do
here _ we really have to bring the families of these kids
together,'' said Goode. ``Something has to be done. We have to
address the needs of this community.''

<TEXT>
   Fats Domino is New Orleans' latest pinup star
_ four times over.
   Four identical portraits of Domino smile out of the 1989 New
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival poster, which was unveiled here
Tuesday.
   ``That's just fine,'' the 62-year-old singer said of the poster.
``It represents when I was young and I like that about it.''
   The poster was done by New Orleans artist Richard Thomas, who
tinted 1960s pictures of Domino in four colors.
   ``After I was chosen to do the poster they told me they either
wanted Louis Armstrong or Fats Domino and I said `Let's do Fats,'''
Thomas said. ``I love them both, but people always kid me about how
much I look like Fats.''
   Domino, who said he works five to six months a year now, will
play May 7 at the 20th annual Jazz Fest this year.
   ``I play there every couple of years. I been at it since I was
18 so I'm slowing down a little now,'' he said.
   Wherever he plays, Domino said, the crowds ask for his old hits,
particularly ``Blueberry Hill.''
   ``All I need is a good piano and a good mike and I'm happy,'' he
said. ``I don't care if it's 10 people or 4,000 _ as long as I see
people enjoying themselves it makes no difference. I have a good
time too.''

   A police records clerk said Tuesday
that she was being fired from her job because she married another
member of the police force, even though she and her husband have
since filed for divorce.
   ``I'm going to appeal,'' said Evelyn Atencio, whose marriage
last August to Lt. Bob Larson placed their jobs in jeopardy because
of the city's nepotism policy.
   Atencio and Larson filed for divorce last month in an effort to
save their jobs. Despite that, Atencio said, Police Chief Bob Evers
decided to fire her as of April 20. It was not clear why she was
singled out and not her husband.
   Evers and City Manager Mark Achen did not return telephone calls
seeking comment Tuesday and the police chief told a reporter
waiting outside his office that he would have nothing to say about
the case.
   Atencio has worked in the police department for nine years and
her husband for 16. She said she wasn't interested in another city
job that paid less than her current job.
   ``I can't afford a cut in pay,'' she said. ``I was left
destitute after my (previous) divorce and I'm not going to let that
happen again.''
   The 34-year-old mother of three children said she ``didn't marry
Bob for him to support my kids.''
   City officials say that Larson, as administrative services
lieutenant, is in charge of Atencio's direct supervisor and as such
has control over his wife's job.
   Larson and Atencio say that because Larson doesn't directly
supervise his wife, they aren't violating the nepotism policy.
   Atencio said the couple filed for divorce March 13 after city
personnel director Claudia Hazelhurst agreed that they would be
given more time to find new jobs ``if we could show intent to
divorce and documentation that divorce proceedings were under way.''
   Colorado law requires at least 90 days before a divorce becomes
final.

<HEAD>Donors Pledge All Funds Needed for Sudan Relief Operation</HEAD>

   Donors pledged all $133 million needed to
stockpile food in Sudan before the rainy season isolates villages,
but a U.N. official said Tuesday not all Sudanese who need help can
be reached.
   James P. Grant, head of Operation Sudan Lifeline and director of
the U.N. Children's Fund, told reporters the goal of aiding 1
million people and preventing more than 100,000 deaths by
starvation ``may be unrealistic, but it's what is needed.''
   ``We have no alternative but to try.''
   The operation hopes to move 110,000 tons of food to isolated
villages in Sudan before the rains begin in May, washing out roads
and airstrips.
   In August 1985, at the height of the Ethiopian famine,
international agencies delivered only 85,000 tons of food under far
more favorable conditions.
   The United Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese starved to death
last year because of flood, drought or war-induced famine.
   Grant said about 22,000 tons of food have been delivered so far,
divided about equally between areas controlled by the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum and rebel areas in the
south, which is mainly Christian or animist.
   The emergency program had received $77 million in pledges by the
time Grant led a U.N. planning conference a month ago in Khartoum
and received pledges for te rest of the $133 million needed at a
donor pledging meeting Tuesday.
   Pledges include $11 million from the United States, $10 million
from the European Community, and the donation by France and West
Germany of the services of four Transall aircraft to carry relief
supplies, said Grant.
   Grant denied reports that Juba in southern Sudanese was cut off
from airlifts by threats from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army or that Ethiopia closed its border to food convoys.
   ``There is no cease-fire,'' Grant acknowledged, but he said two
relief flights are reaching Juba daily.
   The co-coordinator for Operation Lifeline Sudan, Vincent
O'Reilly, said Monday that Ethiopia's President Mengistu Haile
Mariam closed the border.
   Grant said Mengistu has cabled Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar reaffirming his complete support for the convoy program,
and negotiations are under way on details of road shipments.

<HEAD>Bush Administration To Appeal Wheelchair Lifts Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government wants to appeal a
decision requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public buses, saying
the ruling would cost the nation's mass transit systems $90 million
a year.
   Groups representing the disabled praised the Feb. 13 ruling by
the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as a means to help put
handicapped people into the mainstream, but transit agencies said
the costly lifts are rarely used.
   In petitioning Monday for a rehearing by the full court, the
government said the ruling contradicted Congress' intent. In
addition, the government argued, the court failed to comprehend the
full cost of the order.
   In the 2-1 decision, the court ordered the U.S. Department of
Transportation to rewrite regulations that allow communities to
offer only ``paratransit'' service, such as van rides, to the
disabled. The court said the 24-hour reservations that van riders
need hindered spontaneous use of mass transit.
   The judges said instead that all new buses must be equipped with
lifts.
   Since the decision, disabled people nationwide have demonstrated
in hopes of persuading the Bush administration to allow the ruling
to stand.
   The case was brought by the American Disabled for Accessible
Public Transit and other groups for handicapped people.
   Stephen Gold, an attorney for ADAPT, said the Bush
administration's decision to appeal is ``a slap in the face'' and
renders the president's pledge of a ``kinder, gentler nation'' a
hollow promise.
   `It'll keep disabled people out of the mainstream and out of
jobs for years and years to come,'' he said.
   In its petition, the government argued the legislation does not
require ``wholesale restructuring of mass-transit services or
imposition of the attendant financial burdens on an already
overburdened public transportation system.''
   The government said transit agencies across the country would
pay $90 million a year for the lifts. In addition to $10,000 for
each lift, the government said, maintenance and operating expenses
would add $9,600 over 12 years.

   Investigators recovered two flight
recorders Tuesday from the Fokker 27 which crashed into a mountain
cliff, killing all 22 people aboard, and sought clues as to why the
plane strayed from its flight path on its final landing approach.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre set up a commission to
investigate the crash, which occurred Monday night about 15 miles
east of Valence.
   The twin-engine Uni-Air plane, chartered by Europe Aero Service,
was bound from Paris to Valence on a domestic flight. Air
controllers lost contact with it about 10 minutes before it was to
land.
   Delebarre came to Valence to convey government condolences to
kin of the 19 passengers and three crew. He said an investigating
commission must ``make clear what happened and, mainly, why this
plane was not within its itinerary.'' According to preliminary
information, the aircraft also was flying too low, the French news
agency Agence France-Presse reported.

   Dense smoke from fires in dried-up Everglades
wetlands cloaked Miami on Tuesday, cutting visibility, alarming
senior citizens with breathing problems, and leading to evacuation
of an alien detention camp.
   U.S. immigration officials closed their busy office building
because of the choking fumes. State troopers briefly closed a
stretch of U.S. 41, the southernmost east-west route across
Florida, because of near-zero visibility. No accidents were
reported.
   ``From the window, it looks like the city is in flames,'' said
Miami Beach Fire Lt. Luis Garcia. ``You can't see across the bay
(to downtown Miami) and it's getting worse.''
   Brush fires are normal in Florida this time of the year, but are
more numerous and intense this season because of an unusually dry
winter.
   Health alerts were issued because of the choking haze, which
meteorologists said was lessened by evening seabreezes but would
remain a problem until predicted northeast winds moved in Wednesday
morning.
   ``I came here for sun and I got smoke _ figure that out,'' said
Albert Smith, a tourist from Minneapolis, as he squinted into the
haze.
   Fires licked to within a mile of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Krome Avenue Detention Center on the edge
of the Everglades, and Perry Rivkind, INS district director,
ordered the 700 aliens there moved to Miami's Bobby Maduro Baseball
Stadium.
   Rivkind said if conditions didn't improve by early Wednesday,
the aliens could be sent by bus to an immigration camp in Port
Isabel, Texas.
   ``It's very serious. We've got an emergency,'' said Rivkind, who
earlier closed the downtown INS headquarters, which is usually
jammed with people. The Maduro stadium, spring training home of the
Baltimore Orioles major-league team, was recently used as a
makeshift home for Nicaraguan refugees.
   Gerard Jean-Juste, a leader of the Haitian exile community,
protested shifting Haitian aliens to the outdoor stadium instead of
letting them go to churches or homes in the Little Haiti community.
   ``These people suffered in Haiti, they suffered in Krome. They
should at least let the pregnant women and children go,'' he said.
   Jean-Juste dropped his protest when Rivkind allowed several
pregnant women and children to spend the night in the care of
Haitian community groups.
   The smoke from fires 20 to 30 miles away blocked the sun, and
jets were barely visible as they took off from Miami International
Airport, where officials said normal operations continued despite
the haze.
   Tourists expressed puzzlement when they walked outside to find
they could barely see the beach at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel.
   ``It's kind of weird,'' said Lisa Cole, a hotel publicist and
lifelong Miami resident.
   ``I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so
heavy,'' said Anna Nasher, a federal courthouse secretary who lives
in suburban Coral Gables.
   The Dade County Health Department and the National Weather
Service advised people with respiratory problems to stay indoors.
   Some senior citizens who woke up coughing were alarmed, hospital
officials said.
   ``Fear becomes an integral part of the problem for us. They
panic and call rescue,'' said Dr. John Davison, who said several
had called for emergency transport to Pembroke Pines General
Hospital while others flooded the southwestern Broward County
hospital's switchboard.
   At Greenbriar Nursing Center, whose 175 patients all suffer from
respiratory ailments, workers tried to make sure windows and doors
were kept shut.
   ``As this smoke comes into the building, even you or I would
experience shortness of breath or a feeling of headache,'' said
administrator Russell Silverman. ``For people who already have
respiratory problems, you can't have open doors.''
   He said visibility around the southwest Dade County center was
less than a quarter-mile.
   Forestry officials said 3,000 acres of dried-out sawgrass were
in flames west of Miami.
   Metro-Dade firefighters have put down four major brushfires near
populated areas since last weekend. One blaze had burned an
estimated 12,000 acres, firefighters said. Two fires were reported
in Palm Beach County grasslands.
   Brushfires have also sprung up sporadically in other parts of
Florida in recent days. Last week, a series of fires charred 58,000
acres along central Florida's Gulf Coast.

   A moderate earthquake shook eastern Puerto

U.S. Geological Survey.
   The quake, measured at 4.3 on the Richter scale, was felt
throughout the capital of San Juan, the eastern half of the island,
and the neighboring Virgin Islands, said USGS spokeswoman Pat
Jorgenson.
   There were no immediate rports of damage, she said.
   The quake's epicenter was in the Caribbean Sea, 50 miles of San

   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by a quake.
A temblor of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a sentimental moment for country's
top entertainer Hank Williams Jr., the rowdy Southerner notorious
for wild party songs, when he upstaged Alabama's artist of the
decade proclamation.
   It appeared to be Alabama's night early during Monday night's
24th annual Academy of Country Music Awards presentations as the
country rockers joined Marty Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the
prestigious artist-of-the-decade ranks.
   The band has won 13 ACM trophies since 1982, and has had 21
consecutive No. 1 singles, including ``Feels So Right,'' ``The
Closer You Get,'' ``Roll On'' and ``You've Got the Touch.''
   But the evening was stolen by Williams, who beat Alabama again
for his third consecutive entertainer of the year award, when he
accepted his trophy before the crowd of 1,600.
   ``I didn't think I was going to get the first one,'' said
Williams, son of the legendary singer-songwriter who died in 1953.
``I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender.
   ``I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all of you in
this room and all the fans out there.''
   While on stage, Williams referred to his current hit record and
video, the much-talked about father-son duet ``Tear in My Beer''
using an old demo tape his father made decades ago. He earlier
performed the song, which featured a stirring video interplay with
his late father.
   ``The video with daddy was the most special thing I ever did in
my life,'' Williams said, choking back tears and biting his lip in
a bid for composure.
   The two-hour, Dick Clark-produced NBC special fared well in the
ratings, winning the time slot and luring a larger national
audience than last month's Grammy Awards.
   If there was a surprise, it was Randy Travis leaving the show
empty-handed, despite three nominations. He's won eight ACM
trophies since 1986 and earlier this year won an American Music
Awards and a Grammy Award.
   K.T. Oslin and Kathy Mattea each won two awards, Miss Oslin for
album of the year and best female vocalist and Miss Mattea's
``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' for year's best record and
song. George Strait won in the male vocalist category.
   The Los Angeles-based band Highway 101 won its second
consecutive vocal group trophy, and the mother-daughter singing duo
The Judds, Naomi and Wynonna, took a fifth consecutive duet award.
   Suzy Bogguss was named top new female vocalist, while Rodney
Crowell, whose wife is country singer Rosanne Cash, was named the
top new male vocalist. The lifetime achievement Pioneer Award was
given to Buck Owens.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a group of bondholders said Tuesday
that a $750 million settlement in the $2.25 billion Washington
Public Power Supply System default case was the best deal they
could get.
   U.S. District Court Judge William D. Browning heard the
appraisal at a hearing on how to distribute money from settlements
made late last year in the WPPSS fraud case, the biggest default in
U.S. municipal bond history.
   The settlement must be divided among more than 24,000 plaintiffs
and attorneys.
   However, representatives of a separate group of bondholders in
the class-action suit said they will argue that no settlement
should be allowed until after the court decides individual
bondholders' and attorneys' shares in the settlement.
   The attorneys also want to argue that the state of Washington,
the Bonneville Power Administration and WPPSS should bear more
responsibility for their roles in the case.
   The legal action grew from WPPSS' 1983 default on $2.25 billion
in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were
abandoned before completion.
   Melvyn Weiss, a plaintiff attorney, said he and other attorneys
for bondholders felt that the best they might achieve if they won
the case was a $1.4 billion settlement.
   The $750 million settlement was much more realistic, ``and it
could well be much less,'' said Weiss.
   Weiss said he recognized it's ``a horrible thing'' for people to
lose money that could have meant their retirement or savings for
education, but ``we also understand if you get nothing, it's
nothing.''
   Attorneys for the bondholders unhappy with the settlement
promised to press their argument before Browning.
   ``We have a hard fight,'' Arthur Hoffer, who is pursuing a
separate class-action suit against the state of Washington on
behalf of bondholders, said Monday night. ``But we're not going to
give up.''
   Defendants in the federal lawsuit, which incorporated dozens of
separate suits filed as early as 1983 in federal court in Seattle,
included the supply system, the 88 utilities that contracted with
WPPSS to build the two plants, engineering firms, the Wall Street
bond underwriters, utility and WPPSS directors and the advisory
firm of Blyth Eastman.

   Civil guards defused two more package bombs
in Spain Tuesday in what appeared a drive by Basque separatists to
unnerve the government following a breakdown in talks between the
two sides in Algeria.
   A bomb sent to Transportation and Communications Minister Jose
Barrionuevo was opened by a ministry employee but a faulty
triggering device kept it from exploding, officials said.
   Barrionuevo is a former interior minister who led the fight
against the Basque separatist group ETA for nearly six years.
   Earlier Tuesday, experts defused a package bomb addressed to an
army sergeant in a military mountain training school in the
Pyrenees.
   On Monday, a package bomb exploded at the same school, seriously
injuring another sergeant.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police blamed the ETA,
which has fought for 21 years for self-determination for Spain's
northern Basque Country.
   Two other package bombs were sent Monday and Friday, and one
maimed a high school gym teacher.
   On Saturday, eight bombs exploded along the railway line linking
Vitoria with Pamplona, causing heavy damage but no injuries.

   A fire that turned into a ``real witch's
brew'' of dangerous chemicals burned itself out after about 1,600
people were evacuated and 17 were taken to hospitals, authorities
said Tuesday.
   The fire at Pacific Intermediates, a company that blends
chemicals for pharmacies and other businesses, started about 6 p.m.
Monday, and burned through the night. It kept people from their
homes for more than 12 hours.
   The Red Cross housed 357 people at an evacuation center set up
at Buena High School until they were allowed to return home at 5:15
a.m. Tuesday, about 75 minutes after the fire burned itself out.
   One hundred people were ordered to evacuate and another 1,500
were asked to leave their homes voluntarily, said Ventura County
Fire Department Dispatcher Vicki Crabtree. The unincorporated town
of Saticoy is about 75 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Noxious fumes sent 17 people to hospitals, firefighters said.
All were treated and released except Ventura County Fire Department
Capt. Sam Turner, who was in stable condition Tuesday at Los Robles
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks.
   The fire's cause was still under investigation Tuesday, Ms.
Crabtree said. She said there was no damage estimate yet.
   The 35,000-square-foot industrial building housed several
businesses, but only the chemical plant and an auto repair firm
were gutted.
   Pacific Intermediates had stocks of several kinds of hazardous
and toxic chemicals, including cyanide, hydrogen, corrosives, and
several materials that react violently with water, said fire Capt.
Tom Kruschke.
   With the mix of chemicals and fire, he said: ``We don't know
exactly what we're coming up with here. It becomes a real witch's
brew for us.''
   More than 130 firefighters were sent to the plant, but they
could not spray water on the chemicals. Besides the fear of
chemical reaction, there was concern that water runoff would
contaminate the Santa Clara River, Kruschke said.
   ``The best thing to do is just let it burn itself out,''
Kruschke said.
   Firefighters said Pacific Intermediates was cited last year for
having larger quantities of chemicals than allowed on its premises.
The citation for violating county ordinances has yet to reach
court, they said.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an
interview published Tuesday that Israel's proposed elections in the
occupied lands could take place in six months if the United States
can persuade ``whoever needs to agree to elections.''
   Rabin did not mention the U.S. dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization that began in December, but repeated
several times that Washington will have to play to play a major
role in negotiating the elections process, according to the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper.
   It quoted unidentified Israeli officials as saying a U.S. Middle
East envoy was expected to open talks next month.
   The paper quoted Rabin as saying it would be possible to have
Palestinians from outside the occupied lands take part in the
negotiations on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
He offered no names but mentioned past proposals to include
prominent Palestinian professors in America, it added.
   Rabin, of the center-left Labor Party, said he believed
elections were possible within six months but that Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir thought nine to 12 months would be needed.
   ``I presume that the Americans, who support the idea, will do
all they can to persuade whoever needs to agree to elections,''
Rabin was quoted as saying.
   Shamir, leader of the rival right-wing Likud bloc, said Monday
he stood by his view that the PLO could play no role, even
indirectly.
   The PLO, in a statement issued Monday by its WAFA news agency,
rejected the Shamir plan. It said elections could be held only
under international supervision after Israel withdraws from the
lands it has occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Hanna Siniora, a prominent Palestinian moderate in Jerusalem,
said Tuesday elections were a possibility even without complete
Israeli withdrawal.
   But he said Israel would have to deal at least indirectly with
the PLO and link the vote to an overall negotiating strategy that
promised a land-for-peace trade.
   Siniora said Israel's suggestions ``are suspended in thin air
without any regard to the future. They are trying to sidestep
talking about land for peace and withdrawal by trying to spotlight
elections.''

<HEAD>Belgium Wants To Delay Nuclear Arms Upgrading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it wants
NATO to delay a decision to modernize its short-range nuclear arms
until the early 1990s and agree to open East-West arms talks about
these weapons as soon as possible.
   ``By adopting this position, Belgium hopes to contribute to .. .
arms control and disarmament,'' Prime Minister Wilfried Martens
told a joint session of Parliament's defense and foreign affairs
committees.
   By seeking a delay, Belgium joins West Germany, where the issue
has caused political friction. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said recently
he wants any production decision delayed until 1991 or 1992, after
important elections in West Germany next year.
   The United States and Britain seek an early commitment to
modernization.
   Martens defended a delay by pointing to a new climate of detente
and a more moderate leadership in Moscow.
   ``The Atlantic alliance nations evidently cannot remain
insensitive to the policy of perestroika and glasnost,'' he said.
   Martens said Defense Minister Guy Coeme would present Belgium's
view to a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels next week.
   He said no decision to upgrade short-range nuclear arms should
be taken before 1991-92, adding that ``the government hopes
negotiations on ... (such) arms can begin as soon as possible.''
   ``The government will do all it can to achieve that goal. It is
determined to open an active diplomatic action, both within NATO .
.. and in bilateral contacts.''
   He said Belgium agreed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
should ``maintain tactical nuclear arms, where needed, without
significant increases in their ranges.''
   Martens' announcement was seen as reflecting a compromise on
nuclear arms within his center-left coalition government. The
Socialist partners of Christian Democrat Martens strongly oppose an
early modernization decision.
   Martens referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
program of economic and political reforms which he said were of
``historic importance.''
   The prime minister said a delay to modernize was entirely
consistent with NATO efforts to draft a comprehensive overview of
its defense needs over the next decades. This overview, under study
since June 1987, is to be released at a summit meeting of the NATO
leaders in Brussels on May 29-30.
   Within NATO, America and Britain want quick approval of plans to
boost the range of the 700 nuclear-armed Lance missiles from 65 to
roughly 250 miles by the mid-1990s.
   This is part of a modernization program that also covers
artillery shells and replacing free-fall bombs with air-to-ground
missiles.
   The new Lances and the air-launched missiles would be deployed
as of 1995. The gun shells already have been upgraded or are being
improved.
   The United States and Britain want to move ahead on the new
Lances now so the U.S. Congress can allocate the required research
and development funds. The two countries oppose negotiations about
these weapons.
   ``We cannot accept negotiations about short-range nuclear
arms,'' a U.S. source at NATO said Tuesday, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``We think these weapons are necessary to NATO strategy. There
are the only (nuclear) weapons left in Europe,'' he said, following
U.S.-Soviet accord to remove ground-launched, medium-range nuclear
missiles.
   The source said an alliance commitment to the new Lance does not
imply a decision to produce the missiles.
   ``What we want (from the allies) is a signal so that the
Congress can proceed with funds for research and development,'' he
said, adding that such a signal would go a long way to stifle
congressional complaints that the European NATO allies do not pull
their weight in NATO.

<HEAD>Boston Schools Chief Took Bumpy Ride From the Start</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, ``Wilson had ...,'' to ADD that Wilson subject
to professional review.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Boston School Committee voted 7-6 Tuesday
night to approve a two-year contract keeping embattled Laval S.
Wilson in charge of the nation's oldest school system.
   The decision on the divisive issue was made on the deadline set
by the board. It was announced by committee President Tom O'Reilly
after members met behind closed doors for about two hours.
   Wilson said he was delighted with the vote and looked forward
``to continuing to work for the young people of Boston.''
   He admitted having had some differences with committee members
but said he believed he could work with them productively.
   ``It's not a working situation,'' retorted committee member
Robert Cappucci, a Wilson opponent. ``I don't see how Dr. Wilson
thinks he'll be able to get anything done.
   ``If I were him, I'd see the handwriting on the wall, realize
what I've tried to do hasn't worked and bow out,'' Cappuci said.
``He is not the man for the Boston job.''
   But committee member John Nucci, who supports Wilson, said it
was everyone's duty to try to make the uneasy union work.
   ``I hope they realize that personal vendettas have to be put
aside in the interest of the school system,'' Nucci said.
   Wilson had spent the past two weeks trying to work out a new
contract with three of the school committee members. Under Tuesday
night's action, Wilson is subject to a professional review every
six months, at which time the committee can reconsider his contract.
   The arrival of Wilson, whose four-year contract expires in June,
was heralded as a mature step for Boston. A black man was going to
run schools in a city that erupting in racial violence over federal
court-ordered busing in 1974.
   Only days after Wilson was hired, he asked for and got a $15,000
raise, to make his yearly salary $85,000.
   Since then, white flight to private schools has left the system
mostly black. Of the system's 1972 enrollment of 96,000, 60 percent
was white. Today, there are 59,000 students, 24 percent of them
white.
   Critics of the 53-year-old Chicago native complain he is aloof
and autocratic.
   ``This isn't a racial issue, it's a competence and quality
issue,'' school committee member Peggy Davis-Mullen, who is white
and is one of Wilson's fiercest detractors, said Monday. ``He's a
diligent worker, but his approach isn't meeting the needs of the
children of Boston.''
   ``He lacks the insight and the philosophy that this system needs
to move forward,'' Mrs. Mullen said. ``Although we've had $100
million added to the budget (now $361 million) since Dr. Wilson
arrived, the dropout rate has increased.''
   Supporters praise Wilson's hard work and honesty, saying he
needs more time.
   ``You really can't get anything done changing horses in
midstream. Just changing who it is right now isn't going to change
a thing,'' said Jean McGuire, a former school social worker and one
of four black school committee members.
   In a self-assessment requested by the School Committee, Wilson
gave himself high marks for dedication and for raising math and
reading scores on national standardized tests and for lowering the
dropout rate.
   Wilson says fewer youngsters are quitting school each year. The
school system figures, however, show increasing attrition in class
size between ninth grade and graduation day. The Class of 1983 was
33 percent smaller than when it began; the Class of '87 eroded by
40 percent.

   If Diego Alonso is a young Mozart, his parents
don't want to make too much of a fuss about it.
   That's why they whisked the 5-year-old out of their native
Spain, where the press hailed him as a genius and a virtuoso, and
enrolled him in kindergarten at the Mackintosh Academy, a school
for gifted children in Denver.
   ``We wanted him to get a well-rounded education, and be with
children his own age who are more like him,'' said Rosa Alonso
Plaza, 29, Diego's mother.
   She and her husband, Manual, 49, are amateur musicians who set
out to create a musical child. While pregnant they played scales to
the fetus because, she said, ``we love music, and we think music is
very important for the development of the child's mind _ the
creative, abstract mind.''
   Diego began singing scales when he was 6 months old, his parents
say, and at 2 began to read music.
   At 3, he could play simple Bach pieces on the piano.
   Alan Weber, a teacher at the National Conservatory of Music in
Paris who tested Diego, said the 3-year-old showed exceptional
gifts and could listen to music and then play it back by memory.
Weber said Diego should not be schooled with children his own age.
   In February 1988, when he was 4, Diego had an audience before
Queen Sofia of Spain, but declined to play. Instead, he showed the
queen a game he played in which he stands with his back to a piano
and identifies any note that is struck.
   All the attention, however, soon made Diego stop playing for
several months. He was, after all, only 4, and according to his
parents has a stubborn streak.
   ``It was too much pressure,'' his mother said.
   So they brought him to the United States this fall and to the
Mackintosh school. In Denver, he has had to learn English, and he
takes piano lessons and dance classes after school. But he
practices piano only about five minutes a day, and his parents say
they don't want to force him to concentrate on his music any more
than that yet.
   ``We think, little by little, he'll do it,'' Rosa Alonso Plaza
said.
   Carolyn Shaak, Diego's piano teacher in Denver, says he is
exceptional for his age and has perfect pitch, but the child would
love to do anything else but play the piano.
   ``He has put up certain barriers. He wouldn't want to be forced
to sit there,'' she said. ``The potential is there. ... It depends
what he does with it. He certainly has the intelligence.''
   She said his coordination was about average for a 5-year-old.
   Eve Mackintosh, the director of the school, calls the boy a
genius who has caught on quickly in all subjects. She thinks his IQ
is higher than the 139 at which he tested when he was 4.
   Rosa Alonso, a former secretary and a violinist, played scales
and repetitive melodies on the violin at least three times a day at
regular intervals while she was pregnant _ ``at the same beat as
the mother's heart.''
   Manual, who worked for the telephone company in Spain, plays the
piano. He said Diego showed an early fascination with the
instrument, peeking around his father's back to watch him play and
crawling underneath the piano to watch the pedals move.
   The couple filled their home with classical music during the
pregnancy, and when Diego was born they would sing him to sleep
with scales.
   The Alonsos are unemployed in Denver, writing a book about
child-rearing and hoping for an extension of their visa, which runs
out this month. Living on savings, they are not sure how long they
will stay in Denver but would like Diego to finish eighth grade at
Mackintosh before returning to Europe for high school.
   Diego is on a partial scholarship at Mackintosh, and the Alonsos
are hoping a foundation or university will step in and help support
his education.
   But they don't like the child to be bothered by the press, and
asked that reporters and photographers not talk to Diego at school
because that might draw attention to him.
   In a recent music class at the academy, however, Diego drew
attention all by himself. When music teacher David Glenn asked each
child in the kindergarten class to name their favorite musicians,
Diego pulled up two names many of the children could barely
pronounce: Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff.

<HEAD>Bush's Barometer City Seeks to Capitalize on Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Call it the Heartland. Call it Middle
America. Call it America's Hometown.
   But, please, just call _ especially if you're a big-time
journalist who can put this High Plains town in the national news.
   Imbued with a new sense of pride _ and a hunger for publicity _
after President Bush styled Lubbock a barometer for national
opinion, civic leaders want the Washington press corps to make a
habit of asking Bush what Lubbock thinks of national issues, from
the minimum wage to arms control.
   ``D.C., Phone Home,'' was the headline of a full-page ad Lubbock
officials ran in the Washington-Baltimore edition of The Wall
Street Journal recently to kick off a campaign to promote this city
of 187,000 as everybody's hometown.
   The ad closed with the city's new slogan: ``Look. Listen.
Lubbock. Now.''
   ``President Bush has really given us something we can rally
around,'' said Randy Christian, a local advertising executive who
helped think up the slogan.
   The city is buying advertising, buttons and T-shirts to
capitalize on all the free publicity Bush handed it.
   Notoriety hit the city when Bush recounted during a nationally
televised news conference a conversation with an old friend in
Texas, who told him ``all the people in Lubbock think things are
going just great.''
   Bush's story took city leaders by surprise. But it didn't take
them long to see they were getting the kind of publicity money
couldn't buy.
   After reporters stopped calling and the crews from ``Good
Morning, America,'' took their lights and cameras out of the local
pancake house, Lubbock's leaders went to work devising ways to stay
in the spotlight.
   ``We felt that this was an opportunity we should take advantage
of,'' said Mayor B.C. ``Peck'' McMinn, who treasures a handwritten
note from Bush thanking McMinn for his comments about Lubbock
residents' support of the president during the media onslaught.
``It's just been feeding on itself.''
   McMinn even got a congratulatory call from James Maloof, mayor
of the town made famous by the Nixon administration's, ``Will it
play in Peoria?''
   ``All of a sudden we were propelled into the limelight,'' said
Lee Stafford, executive vice president of the city's industrial
development board.
   He hopes greater awareness of Lubbock might bring the west Texas
city more jobs, tourists and conventions. City officials aren't
sure what the whole campaign will cost. They spent $6,100 on the
Wall Street Journal ad.
   It's too early to look for results, but the attention showered
on this agriculture-based town already has spawned envy among other
midsized cities.
   ``There are a lot of other Texas cities that want me to get the
President to mention their cities,'' said U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
   While Lubbock doesn't boast about its crime rate, with a
burglary incidence that's among the highest in the nation, or the
dust that swirls through town from the surrounding cotton fields
each spring, being America's Heartland makes the city an easier
sell, Stafford said. ``We're not just another city out looking for
new business. We're Lubbock and that's a unique term now.''
   Others express the more altruistic desire that Lubbock's example
will remind politicians the ``real America'' knows and cares what's
going on in the nation's capital.
   ``It doesn't take a genius to realize that there are many cities
in America just like Lubbock,'' said the ad. ``And how they think
and how they feel about national and international issues is a
barometer our leaders `inside the Beltway' should never ignore.''

<TEXT>
   One of the most abrupt changes ever taken by
those who seek to direct the American economy's course occurred
about 15 years ago under circumstances somewhat similar to those of
today.
   It was during the administration of Gerald Ford, and inflation
was on everyone's mind. The popular patriotic slogan of the day was
``Whip Inflation Now.'' It was printed on lapel buttons and
splashed in advertisements.
   The campaign had an ignominious ending when the facts were
realized _ that the nation was stumbling into recession and that
recession far more than inflation was the big threat to the economy.
   It was not the first time the economic ship of state had been
nearly driven onto the shoals and it wasn't the last either. Almost
all of America's recent presidents have been accused of erratic or
even irresponsible steering.
   In relatively recent history, for example, Herbert Hoover,
Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Lyndon
Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan have suffered criticisms
for their tenure at the wheel.
   But nothing quite matches the abrupt realization in 1974 that
the economy was headed to recession while all eyes were on
inflation. And now, some critics contend there could be a repeat of
the scenario in 1989.
   These critics cannot as yet demonstrate their thesis by means of
the popular statistics, which show the economy still has some
forward momentum. But when you're steering a ship as big as the
U.S. economy you never really know.
   When you flip the control buttons or turn the wheel a few
degrees, for example, nothing seems to happen. A big ship doesn't
turn on a dime; it takes time to observe a change. And when change
comes you cannot reverse it quickly.
   In effect, gloomy analysts are saying that maybe too many
buttons have been pushed already, and that while we haven't seen
the effect so far it is bound to show up in the next few months.
Therefore, they say, beware of recession.
   Adding conviction to their fears, or vice versa, is the uncanny
coincidence of the same man being in the control room.
   In 1974, as chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, Alan Greenspan led the inflation fight. Today, as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he has given inflation
priority over recession.
   Few economists doubt Greenspan's knowledge, or that he is
capable of absorbing wisdom from experience, but one of them, Eric
Heinemann of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., a securities firm, offers
this typical cautionary view:
   ``In sum, we think the economy is vulnerable. A slowdown, if not
worse, is in the cards. Alan Greenspan's zeal to Whip Inflation Now
is commendable. But let's hope he doesn't give us a replay of the
crunch of 1974.''
   The question, says Heinemann, is whether Greenspan will get the
mild slowdown he wants, ``or will we go through something more
sinister?''
   In short, will the economy scrape bottom and continue on its
way? Or will it run aground, spring a leak and spill its energy
like the Exxon Valdez?

   Villagers in southern Lebanon got their
wish. The Irish government has decided to keep its 750-man
batallion in the United Nations peacekeeping forces here.
   The government in Dublin had been reconsidering the Irish
battalion's presence in Lebanon because four of its soldiers had
been killed and one wounded in three attacks in the past three
months. Three of them were killed by a landmine March 21.
   ``We greatly need the Irish contingent in south Lebanon,'' said
Abbas Fawaz, the mayor of Tibnin, a town 11 miles north of the
Israeli border.
   The estimated 100,000 Shiite Moslems living in 20 hamlets around
Tibnin, the Irish headquarters, ``enjoy their protection,'' Fawaz
said.
   Before making the decision, the Irish Cabinet reviewed a report
by Lt. Gen. Tadhg O'Neill, chief of staff of the Irish army, who
had come here to investigate the landmine explosion March 21.
   The Cabinet renews Ireland's commitment every six months, and
the Irish political opposition had called for a policy review after
the deaths. The fourth death occurred earlier.
   ``Our presence here is very vital to the security of the area
and to the locals who depend on our humanitarian aide,'' said Lt.
Col. Pat McMahon, commander of the Irish contingent in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
   On March 30, hundreds of Tebnin's 5,000 residents participated
in a memorial ceremony for the three Irish soldiers killed by the
landmine.
   ``The Irish contingent lives among its people in the south,''
said one of the banners at the ceremony. ``Aggression against it is
aggression on the southerners.''
   The U.N. peacekeeping force, made up of 5,800 personnel from
nine nations, has monitored a narrow strip of 65 towns and villages
in south Lebanon since March 1985.
   The population in the force's area of operation increased from
about 50,000 when the force first arrived to about a half million
people today.
   ``Before UNIFIL came to south Lebanon ... the area was a free
terrain to militiamen and terrorists who spread fear and death
everywhere,'' said Fawaz, 64, who has been mayor for 20 years.
   ``Now everyone is moving around here peacefully and freely,
thanks to the Irish battalion.''
   An Irish sergeant about to be moved out on routine rotation said
he was leaving with mixed feelings.
   ``There are a lot of poor people here who are in great need of
our humanitarian work, which is worth risking my life for,'' said
the sergeant who could not allow his name to be used because of
standing regulations.
   An Irish major at headquarters in Tebnin said it ``would be a
fire zone without us.''
   ``When the Irish battalion first came here, the villagers did
not have any electricity and had shortages of water,'' he said,
``But we helped them, and now they are confident in their future
because of us.''
   The Irish battalion has lost 30 soldiers in attacks by various
groups over the years.
   Investigations were still under way to determine who planted the
landmine that exploded under a UNIFIL jeep near Haddatha on March
21 and killed the three soldiers, Lt. Col. Patrick Hayes said.
   The other two recent attacks were carried out by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, which controls a
narrow strip of Lebanese territory that Israel refers to as its
``security zone.''
   Israel maintained the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its
invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985, ending a
three-year occupation.
   The terrain, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea in the
west to the slopes of snow-peaked Mount Hermon in the east, serves
as a buffer against cross-border infiltrations by Palestinian
guerrillas into northern Israeli settlements.
   Col. McMahon blamed Israel for the South Lebanon Army attacks on
the Irish battalion. He said such hostilities were due to ``the
lack of control from the Israeli army command on the SLA
militiamen.''
   Hassan Fawaz, the son of Tebnin's mayor who owns a gift shop
near the Irish battalion headquarters, said, ``Tebnin residents
notify the Irish command about the possibility of any attack on
them that we come to know of.''
   The younger Fawaz stressed the economic value that the Irish
battalion represents to the area. The troops spend at least
$500,000 annually on souvenirs and goods they buy duty-free from
local stores.

   On April 26, the U.S. Supreme Court will convene
for a 60-minute hearing on one of America's most polarizing issues
_ abortion. The debate centers on a Missouri law that restricts
abortion and declares that human life begins at conception. The two
sides in this Missouri case represent in microcosm the deeply
divided sentiments felt across the country. In two stories, part of
an intermittent series on abortion issues, The Associated Press
profiles key players in this Missouri case: the pro-choice
advocates and the clinic at the heart of the dispute, and the
leader of the anti-abortion forces, a man committed to a fight he
sees as good vs. evil.

   B.J. Isaacson-Jones has days when she knows
that dressing in red will provoke the ugly taunts again.
   ``B.J., you're wearing red,'' scream the protesters sometimes
gathered outside her office. ``Does that match the blood on your
hands?''
   The taunts have taken a toll on the director of Reproductive
Health Services, the abortion clinic at the heart of an emotional
and explosive debate before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``It's not unusual for me to close my office door and sob,'' she
said. ``I'm proud of the way I live my life. It's hard when you're
standing close to people and you can feel the hatred. I don't hate
people.''
   The intense feelings are likely to grow even stronger as April
26 draws nearer, the day the Supreme Court hears arguments over a
Missouri statute that could chip away or overturn the 1973 ruling
that legalized abortion.
   For anti-abortion advocates who've been waiting and working for
this day for 16 years, it's a time of great hope. But for
pro-choice supporters, just as eager to prevent this moment, it's a
time of high anxiety.
   ``We are gravely concerned about this case,'' said
Isaacson-Jones, whose non-profit clinic is the largest in the
Midwest. ``What's at stake here is women's lives. It's that
complicated and that simple.''
   Missouri's pro-choice forces have grown from a small underground
movement to a group of determined activists challenging a state
whose Legislature has passed anti-abortion measures by 5-1
majorities.
   Two veteran advocates are key players in this case: Frank
Susman, a lawyer who will be arguing his fifth Missouri abortion
case before the high court, and Judith Widdicombe, a former nurse
at a Roman Catholic hospital and the founder of the clinic.
   Together, with Isaacson-Jones, they've shared not only their
convictions, but also death threats, pickets at home or outside the
clinic, obscene phone calls and harassment of their families.
   Susman, who represents the clinic, says someone once placed a
bogus newspaper ad saying his house was for sale. A picket sued him
for $250,000, claiming he'd assaulted her as he escorted a woman
into another clinic where protesters were gathered. A jury cleared
him.
   Reproductive Health is only one of seven plaintiffs _ Planned
Parenthood of Greater Kansas City is another _ but it has been the
target of some of the most vicious attacks. Once, protesters stood
on clinic desks and jumped through a reception window.
   In 1986, five gallons of gas were poured under the waiting room
door and ignited. The blaze caused more than $100,000 damage. No
one was arrested.
   ``This is a very violent movement,'' said Widdicombe, now a
consultant for Voters For Choice in Washington, D.C. ``I think it
has become a rapidly escalating war in the last 10 years.''
   Abortion opponents in Missouri, however, insist they repudiate
violence and say verbal harassment is the wrong way to sway hearts
and minds.
   ``If I have a sincere desire to point out the error of their
ways, I'm not going to be able to accomplish that by screaming and
hollering at them,'' said Sam Lee, a Missouri anti-abortion leader.
   The name-calling and pickets do prompt soul-searching.
   ``I stand in the shower the next morning and go over everything
that was said,'' said Isaacson-Jones, who started at the clinic as
a volunteer. ``I think, could they possibly be right? I go back
stronger in my conviction. I will examine that again. I know I
shall.
   ``But what I return to are the faces of the women I see,'' she
added. ``I always, always understand the reason why a woman has
chosen to terminate her pregnancy. I may not like the reasons she's
waited so long. ...
   ``The antis say God's on their side,'' she said. ``I say God's
on my side as well.''
   Isaacson-Jones' support of abortion rights stems from her high
school days in the '60s when she saw pregnant classmates shunned
and forced to drop out of school. ``I realized the incredible
impact of one sexual experience on the rest of a woman and her
family's life,'' she said.
   Today, she runs a clinic with 64 staff members, 35 volunteers
and two offices. It counsels 15,000 women each year; more than
8,500 choose abortion. The women come from eight states: Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas;
30 percent are poor.
   It's a long way from the late '50s, when Widdicombe, then a
nurse, saw women disfigured trying to abort themselves, sometimes
with lye.
   She later worked at a Catholic hospital, caring for new mothers
in the labor and delivery section, then spending her free time
arranging legal and illegal abortions _ sometimes as far away as
Puerto Rico and Mexico.
   ``The hospital found that totally incongruent,'' Widdicombe
said. She resigned.
   It was a scary time, too. ``There was a level of paranoia,
absolutely,'' Widdicombe said. ``I did think about what it would be
like to go to jail.''
   Susman provided legal advice at the time. He now represents
about 20 abortion clinics nationwide on a part-time basis,
estimating reproductive issues account for about 10 percent of his
work.
   In 1973, Widdicombe opened the clinic. Three hundred protesters
marched outside.
   ``I though we'd just provide a clinic and work ourselves out of
business,'' she said. ``It was pretty naive. We really felt we
would decrease the need for abortion'' with education and research.
   Pro-choice leaders say they've been far less successful in
organizing than their opposition. They also claim abortion foes
misrepresent their cause.
   ``We have allowed this small group to define pro-choice as
pro-abortion,'' said Isaacson-Jones. ``Think about the vivid
pictures the anti-abortion people (display). Who's going to argue
with that? They have signs ... `Money, Blood, Murder' ... That's
not the reality of choice.''
   Unlike her opponents, Isaacson-Jones says she isn't interested
in converting anyone.
   ``I really don't want to change their minds,'' she said. ``I
wish they'd leave us alone and allow us to work in dignity.''
   Susman expresses optimism about this case: ``I do not believe
the court is prepared to turn back the clock 16 years.''

   The Bush administration tried to squelch an
effort by members of the House Banking Committee to weaken the
administration's savings and loan reform plan by diluting a
proposal to toughen capital standards.
   A senior Treasury Department official said Monday the
committee's proposed capital rule ``has the cosmetic appearance of
going in the right direction'' but would ``undermine the
effectiveness of the capital discipline.''
   In reply, a committee aide, also speaking on the condition of

   Asiana Airlines will spend about $1 billion to
buy nine Boeing Co. jetliners and take options on seven more
because the new airline doesn't want to risk its reputation on
older planes, an Asiana executive said.
   In a separate announcement Monday, Gulf Air of Bahrain said it
will spend $1 billion over the next five years to buy six Boeing
767s and 12 Airbus Industrie A-320s.
   The combined value of the Asiana and Gulf Air orders to Boeing
would be about $1.4 billion.
   S.Y. Park, chairman of Kumho Business Group, Asiana's parent
company, said that in addition to wanting new planes, it chose
Boeing was because the Seattle-based plane builder took the new
airline seriously.
   Asiana, based in Seoul, Korea, began operations within that
country on Dec. 23. It said it will use its new jets to expand to
other Asian markets and eventually to North America and Europe.
   ``In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying
or leasing older planes,'' Park said. ``However, a new airline has
enough problems establishing its market base without the burden of
heavy maintenance responsibilities and the uncertainty of whether
older planes will perform reliably.''
   Asiana ordered five 737-400s and took options for another five.
It also signed letters of intent to order two 747-400 jumbo jets
and take options for two more, and to convert two previous options
for widebody 767-300s to firm orders.
   Boeing normally doesn't announce letters of intent, said Boeing
Commercial Airplanes spokesman Randy Harrison, but Asiana had made
it clear it intended to buy the planes.
   Harrison described a letter of intent as just short of an order,
with the major difference being no money is paid to begin
construction.
   Asiana began its Korean service Dec. 23 with six 737-400s leased
from GPA Group Ltd.
   Deliveries of Asiana's new planes will begin in July 1992.
   Gulf Air spokesman Abdullah Abdel-Karim said it was ordering its
new planes on an optional basis, allowing the airline to drop the
order without liability to compensate the manufacturer.
   Gulf Air is owned by the governments of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
Abu Dhabi. The announcement came one day after Gulf Air's board met
in the Qatari capital of Doha.
   Abdel-Karim said the 18 jets will be delivered between 1990 and
1994. Gulf Air is currently spending $260 million to lease four
Boeing 767-300s as part of a modernization program.
   Abdel-Karim said that by June the airline will have nine
Lockheed L-1011 Tri-Stars, eight Boeing 737s and six Boeing
767-300s. The fleet will increase to 40 to 42 aircraft by 1994, he
added.
   Not counting the Gulf Air planes, Boeing has announced orders
for 110 jetliners worth $8.7 billion this year.

   Ford Motor Co. has recalled more than
340,000 cars and trucks for safety-related and other problems.
   The company said Monday it was asking owners of 26,000 1988-89
F-Super Duty trucks and truck chassis to return the vehicles
because of front-end suspension problems that could cause shaking
and loss of steering control.
   Ford said a bolt attaching the front axle track bar bracket to
the front cross-member may loosen. The company said it was aware of
about 120 cases of front-end ``shimmy,'' but no injuries because of
it.
   The company also said 750 of its 1989 Lincoln Continental cars
were being recalled to tighten a bolt in a rear seat-belt
attachment. Those cars were assembled between late November and
early December last year.
   In a non-safety-related matter, Ford said it was asking 302,000
owners if some 1988 Lincoln Continentals, Mercury Sables and Ford
Taurus cars and some F-Series trucks and Econoline vans to return
their vehicles for alternator inspections.
   The company said a problem with an epoxy bond could cause
electrical system problems.
   Ford also said it would provide coverage for about 12,500
1985-86 Merkur XR4Ti cars with leather interiors. The upholstery
may harden, crack or discolor and the seams may fail, the company
said.
   Owners of all vehicles involved in the four announcements will
have repairs performed free of charge.

<HEAD>Burger King Divides Distron Into Supply, Distribution Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King has announced it will split its
procurement and distribution arm, Distron, into separate entities
as part of a previously announced restructuring of the fast-food
chain.
   ``This reorganization is the latest step in our restructuring of
the entire Burger King operation to make the company more
competitive and more focused on the customer,'' Ian Martin,
chairman of Burger King Corp., said Monday.
   Distron will be replaced by Burger King Supply Management and
Burger King Distribution Services.
   The supply management operation will be responsible for buying
corporate restaurant food and supplies at the local and national
levels. Distribution services will deliver food and supplies to
restaurants.
   British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC bought Burger King
and its parent Pillsbury Co. in January after a tough takeover
battle.
   ``Before we acquired Pillsbury and Burger King, our external
analysis of Distron indicated that it would be advisable to sell
the division, because it appeared to hinder the Burger King
system,'' Martin said.
   ``However, now that we have acquired the company and performed
our own in-depth analysis, we have concluded that a reorganized
internal procurement and distribution system will be a tremendous
asset to Burger King,'' he added.
   According to the company, the reorganization will allow it to
consolidate its buying and maximize purchasing power for a more
consistent product.
   Thomas C. Highland will serve as president of Burger King
Distribution Services. He had been president of Distron since June
1988.
   The supply management department will be headed by senior vice
president Christopher Dams. He comes to the Miami-based chain from
Grand Metropolitan Retailing Ltd., where he was retail trading
director.
   Both will report to Barry J. Gibbons, Burger King chief
executive officer.

   Formica Corp. says further discussions are
expected between a special committee of the board of directors and
parties interested in acquiring the laminated products company.
   However, Formica announced Monday that it rejected a revised
$243 million takeover offer from a management-led group, one of
several offers made for the company in recent months.
   Formica officials declined to elaborate on the denial of FM
Acquisition Corp.'s bid, voted on by a special committee of the
board of directors.
   According to the $18.75-per-share offer, additional financing
for the offer would have been provided by an industrial corporation
that signed a confidential agreement with Formica.
   Formica, which makes laminated products used in kitchen
countertops and tables, announced two weeks ago that it received a
$256 million bid, but would not identify the bidder.
   At that time, Formica also said its committee of independent
directors instructed Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to begin
negotiations with the company.
   Last fall, Malcolm Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., businessman,
offered $20 a share in cash and securities for Formica and was
rebuffed. After the management group announced its offer, Glazer
said he was considering a new bid.
   It was not known if the $256 million bid came from Glazer.
   Shearson also is continuing discussions with six other
interested third parties, but Formica spokesman Robert Way would
not comment Monday beyond the contents of the news release.
   FM Acquisition previously offered $18 a share for Formica.
Formica has said its directors approved a definitive merger with
FM, but they also told Shearson to see if others might be
interested in bidding.
   Formica stock closed at $19.75 a share Monday, down from
Friday's closing price of $20.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.

<HEAD>Investment Group To Buy Grand Union Supermarkets For $1.2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Union Co., a privately owned
Northeast-based supermarket chain, will be acquired by a
partnership of investment banks in a deal worth about $1.2 billion,
the buyers announced.
   The acquisition would mark the latest big supermarket takeover
by Wall Street firms, which are attracted to the business because
it is considered largely recession-proof and generates large
quantities of cash.
   Over the past few years, for example, the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. acquired Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2
billion and Stop &amp; Shop Cos. for $1.2 billion; and Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets acquired Supermarkets General Corp. for $1.8
billion.
   Under the Grand Union agreement announced Monday, a company
formed by Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. will
buy all of Grand Union's stock for cash. The total value of the
transaction, including debt and preferred stock, is about $1.2
billion, the investment firms said in a statement.
   Salomon Brothers will provide financing for the deal, which must
be reviewed by the government under federal antimonopoly laws.
   Penn Traffic Co., an affiliate of Miller Tabak, which is a New
York-based brokerage and merchant bank, and the management of Grand
Union also will have an equity stake in the new company formed by
the merger, the statement said.
   Gary D. Hirsch, a principal of Miller Tabak, will be chairman of
the company. Hirsch also is chairman of Penn Traffic, a regional
supermarket chain operating mainly in New York, Pennsylvania and
Ohio with annual sales of $3 billion.
   Floyd Hall, GU's current chairman and chief executive officer,
has elected to retire once the sale of the company is completed.
   Grand Union Co. has been in the food retailing business for more
than 116 years, with annual sales of about $2.7 billion. It owns
and operates 308 supermarkets in seven Northeastern states and
Georgia under the Grand Union and Big Star trade names.
   Hirsch said Grand Union Co. has an excellent management team,
which is expected to pursue expansion plans.

<TEXT>
   Gulf &amp; Western Inc. should be able to get $2.5
billion or more for its giant consumer finance subsidiary that
could be used to buy more media and entertainment properties or
repurchase stock, analysts say.
   Gulf &amp; Western stock rose Monday following its weekend
disclosure that it plans to sell The Associates, the nation's
third-largest consumer finance company, and concentrate on its
entertainment and publishing businesses.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gulf &amp; Western rose
$2.37{ a share to $51.87{.
   Some analysts predicted Chairman Martin S. Davis would use the
huge cash hoard to make acquisitions in the media and entertainment
business, but others said he may use the money to accelerate the
company's stock repurchase plan that has gobbled up more than 45
million shares since 1983.
   ``I'm taking the contrarian view here _ I'm not convinced there
are attractive assets available at prices they would be willing to
pay,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst for
the investment firm Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.
   He said he expects Gulf &amp; Western could get $3 billion to $4
billion for The Associates and use the proceeds for stock
repurchases.
   But Carol Neves, who follows Gulf &amp; Western for Merrill Lynch
Research in New York, said a cash-rich Gulf &amp; Western could be
vulnerable to a takeover.
   ``If they don't know what they are going to do with the cash,
they may have put themselves in play,'' she said.
   Sony Corp., the Japanese electronics giant, already has
indicated interest in buying a U.S. entertainment company.
   Davis was unavailable Monday to comment on what he planned to do
with the proceeds of the sale. The company said in Sunday's
announcement that sale proceeds would be used to expand the
company's communications operations globally through product
development and distribution as well as acquisitions and
investments.
   The sale of The Associates would leave the company with a
Paramount Pictures operation that includes such successful movie
titles as ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and
```Crocodile' Dundee'' and a TV library with more than 2,000
episodes of network shows such as ``Family Ties'' and ``Cheers.''
   Gulf &amp; Western also is a major force in consumer and textbook
publishing through its Simon &amp; Schuster-Prentice Hall division. It
also has interests in cable programming, theaters and sports.
   Some analysts said Davis is under no immediate pressure to
outline acquisition plans. They said finding a buyer for The
Associates and closing the deal could take months.
   They said Gulf &amp; Western already is a big enough force in
entertainment and the media that its place among the global media
giants is assured.
   But the announcement appeared to stir renewed interest in
several media and entertainment companies mentioned recently in
takeover speculation.
   For instance, Tribune Co. was up $1.25 a share to $44.75, Time

MCA Inc. rose 62{ cents to $56.25.
   Since he became chairman of Gulf &amp; Western in 1983, Davis has
narrowed the scope of the once far-flung conglomerate. He sold
businesses ranging from cigarmaking and chemicals to racetracks
while making selective acquisitions in publishing, motion picture
houses and cable television.
   J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst for PaineWebber Inc., said
the proposal to sell the financial unit may help Davis boost the
stock price by simply focusing the investment community's view of
the company.
   Gulf &amp; Western earned $384.7 million, or $3.21 a share, on
revenue of $5.1 billion in 1988.
   The consumer finance operations accounted for 46 percent of its
operating income and 40 percent of its revenue last year.
Entertainment accounted for 31 percent of operating income and 37
percent of revenue, while publishing and information services
contributed 23 percent of operating income and revenue.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark Battle In Diaper Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle between industry giants over
super-absorbent diapers _ and the millions of dollars that come
through their sale _ has opened in U.S. District Court here.
   In the case, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. charges that the design of its
highly successful super-absorbent Pampers was copied by
Kimberly-Clark Corp. in developing super-absorbent Huggies.
   The huge consumer products company wants U.S. District Judge
Falcon Hawkins to order Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing the
Huggies and remove them from store shelves. The company also is
seeking unspecified monetary damages.
   The stakes are high, for making disposable diapers is a $3.3
billion-a-year business, according to court records.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is the industry leader,
with 47 percent of the market. Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2
with about 30 percent, industry analysts say.
   As the trial got under way Monday, attorneys crowded the
courtroom while scattered along the jury box were boxes and bags of
diapers. The case is expected to last at least three weeks.
   Allen Gerstein, representing Procter &amp; Gamble, said P&amp;G came up
with the idea that made super absorbent diapers possible and took
out a patent on the development.
   The breakthrough, he said, allowed the manufacture of diapers
that are generally thinner but more absorbent than regular, more
bulky disposables.
   ``We stayed within the system while Kimberly-Clark disregarded
and took unfair advantage of the system,'' he told Hawkins in his
opening argument.
   P&amp;G Researcher Paul Weisman developed a means for combining wood
pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in the diaper to allow it
to be made thinner, Gerstein said.
   Gerstein said Kimberly-Clark copied the idea shortly after the
Pampers were test marketed in Wichita, Kan., in 1984.
   The introduction of the new diapers ``turned the diaper world on
its ear,'' he said.
   But attorney H. Blair White, representing Kimberly-Clark, said,
``This case is about two fiercely competitive companies each trying
to improve baby diapers.''
   He charged that P&amp;G never had a valid patent because it withheld
important test information from the U.S. Patent Office.
   In addition, he said, the system Weisman developed was already
covered in a British patent for super-absorbing materials issued to
an Italian inventor in 1979.
   ``In order to have a valid patent, you can't be the second
person or the 10th person (to invent something). You have to be the
first,'' he said.
   White argued that Kimberly-Clark had widespread experience with
super-absorbent materials as early as 1977 in the manufacture of
tampons and adult diapers.
   ``Kimberly-Clark didn't need lessons from anyone about super
absorbent products,'' White said, noting that ``the only things our
scientists learned from the Wichita diapers was how not to make a
diaper.''
   White said the problem with the Pampers when they were
introduced was that the super-absorbing material would come off on
the skin of babies.
   It was a problem Kimberly-Clark was trying to address in its own
labs at the time, he said, adding the company eventually developed
a system of putting the material farther away from the babies' skin
_ a system for which the company has been awarded a patent.
   The case is being heard in a non-jury proceeding. It was brought
in South Carolina because Kimberly-Clark runs a diaper
manufacturing plant in Beech Island near Aiken.

<HEAD>Ford Shuffles Executives, Announces Petersen Paid $10.5 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen's $10.5
million pay for 1988 is part of ``Detroit's annual executive
pigout'' and should be spent on new employees and factories
instead, the United Auto Workers union says.
   Ford issued its proxy statement Monday, listing compensation for
the company's top five executives. Also on Monday, Ford announced
three new executive vice presidents, including the likely successor
to Petersen.
   The proxy statement said Petersen was awarded $3.3 million in
salry, bonuses and other benefits and $7.2 million in stock options
for 1988. That's far beyond the $3.7 million Chrysler Corp.
Chairman Lee Iacocca received for 1988.
   General Motors Corp. is expected to issue its proxy statement
within a week.
   At Ford, President Harold Poling followed Petersen in
compensation with awards of $4.1 million _ $2.6 million in salary
and supplemental compensation and $1.5 million in exercised stock
options.
   The UAW said it was pleased by Ford's financial success last
year, but that its profits should be invested instead in the
company and its hourly employees rather than its executives.
   ``We think they would be far better advised to invest in new
facilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuable
resources on trying to keep up with the compensation of junk-bond
barons,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President Stephen
Yokich, who heads the union's Ford Department, said in a statement.
   ``Ford's success in no way justifies the action of Ford's top
executives in taking full advantage of Detroit's annual executive
pigout,'' they said.
   The UAW figured Petersen's hourly wage to be about $5,070,
compared with the hourly wage of a car assembler at $15.73.
   Last year, Ford said Petersen exercised no stock options and
received $3.7 million. Poling exercised $8 million in stock options
and received $10.9 million in compensation for 1987.
   Other Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement, along
with their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock
options exercised, were:
   _Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North American
automotive operations and named Monday as executive vice president
for international automotive operations, $3.5 million.
   _Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of the
Ford Automotive Group, $3 million.
   _Allan Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operations
who Monday was appointed executive vice president for corporate
staffs, $1.7 million.
   Supplemental compensation payments can be deferred into common
stock purchase or other programs. Otherwise, the awards will be
paid in two lump sums, one last month and the other in January
1990, the company said.
   Ford, the nation's most profitable automaker with earnings of
$5.3 billion last year, said its board of directors' compensation
committee limited the total compensation for eligible officers to
$250 million.
   The compensation plan permitted distribution of $375.1 million.
The difference, $125.1 million, will become part of the company's
general fund.
   The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, who was
named Ross' successor, are effective May 1.
   Gilmour also was named to the office of the chief executive and
becomes the odds-on choice to become chairman when Petersen reaches
Ford's mandatory retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991. That
office is shared by Petersen, Poling and Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer Stanley Seneker.
   At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr.,
grandson of the company's founder, Henry Ford, retired from the
company and with it, his title was eliminated. Ford, who was a
member of the office of the chief executive, remains a member of
the company's board of directors.
   The promotion of Gilmour, 54, leaves only GM among the Big Three
without an heir apparent to its chairman. GM Chairman Roger B.
Smith will be the first of the Big Three's leaders to step aside.
Smith turns 65 in July 1990 and is expected to step down about then.
   In November, Chrysler promoted Gerald Greenwald to vice
chairman, tapping him as the likely successor to Chairman Lee
Iacocca, whose contract expires in December 1991.
   Gilmour joined Ford in 1960 as a financial analyst. During his
career with Ford he has been president of Ford Motor Credit Co.,
vice president and controller, vice president for extrnal and
personnel affairs, and executive vice president and chief financial
officer.

<HEAD>Japanese Plan Assault On U.S. Supremacy In Supercomputers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An NEC Corp. supercomputer that will go on sale
next year represents the leading edge of a Japanese assault on
American supremacy in the field of high-speed computing.
   NEC, Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. ``are looking at the 1990s as
the decade in which they plan to make some serious headway in the
supercomputer commercial marketplace,'' said Jeffrey Canin, a San
Francisco-based technology analyst.
   NEC said Monday the fastest member of its SX-X series attains
peak speeds of more than 20 billion operations per second in one
kind of scientific calculation.
   The NEC's peak speed is about 25 percent faster than Cray
Research Inc.'s Cray 3, which is due for shipment to customers
around the same time, the July-September period of 1990.
   Minneapolis-based Cray is likely to hold its lead in
supercomputer sales for several years, partly because hundreds of
programs are written especially to run on its machines, analysts
say.
   But in the long run, there is a chance that Japan's excellence
in supercomputer hardware could slowly overcome America's
entrenched superiority in software.
   ``This new machine is obviously the one to beat,'' said George
Lindamood, an analyst at the Gartner Group consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn. ``I imagine there will be some fairly severe
government wrangling in Washington as a result of this one.''
   Cray stock closed down 12{ cents to $53.87{ a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, reflecting
investors' lack of concern about the short-term effects of the NEC
announcement on the company.
   Supercomputers are considered crucial to national security
because they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons. They
also are used for such tasks as scientific research, oil
exploration and weather forecasting.
   Japan limited sales of U.S.-made supercomputers in its home
market in the early and mid-1980s while its own companies developed
competitive machines.
   The U.S. government has strongly discouraged federal agencies
and universities that receive government grants from buying
Japanese-made supercomputers. NEC has only one installed in the
United States, at the Houston Area Research Consortium.
   It is common for supercomputer makers to leapfrog one another
with new models, but NEC's forthcoming models are unusually
threatening in two respects:
   _NEC's fastest machine achieves its speed with four processors,
while Cray's requires 16. If NEC learns how to hook together more
processors it could extend its lead dramatically.
   _For the first time, NEC is using a base layer of software that
is already familiar to potential American customers, Unix. That
could entice customers who have shied away from NEC until now
because of its unfamiliar operating system.
   Cray is the world's largest supercomputer maker, although
International Business Machines Corp. leads in the number of
machines installed when mainframe computers rigged for
supercomputing work are included.
   Cray spokesman John Swenson said the company takes all its
competitors seriously, but added, ``We still seem to offer the most
effective solution to the user.'' He said peak speed comparisons
are misleading because what counts is how fast a computer will run
a particular customer's jobs.
   ``Every time the Japanese come out with a new machine people
start saying the Japanese are going to eat our lunch. Today we
still have about two-thirds of the worldwide market,'' Swenson said.
   NEC has one undisputed advantage: It is the world's largest
semiconductor manufacturer that sells on the open market, and can
make its own customized, high-speed logic chips.
   Cray relies on Fujitsu for the central logic chips in its Cray
Y-MP line. The central logic chips for its Cray 3 line will come
from a small U.S. company, GigaBit Logic Inc. of Newbury Park,
Calif.
   Possibly the greatest threat to Cray is that American customers
will buy a few Japanese machines because of their sheer speed and
then develop sophisticated software to run on them.
   ``If the Japanese software begins to approach the quality of
what you can get on a Cray, then the competition begins to get very
severe,'' Lindamood said.
   NEC's machines will be sold through HNSX Supercomputers Inc. of
Burlington, Mass., a marketing company jointly owned by NEC and
Honeywell Inc. Its president, James Berrett, said the company would
like a chance at the government market but failing that will sell
to commercial customers, including ``multinationals that are not
singularly concerned with the United States.''
   IBM, not Cray, is the company most feared by the Japanese
supercomputer makers. While IBM never has made a pure
supercomputer, the world's largest computer company is researching
the area intensively and is backing Steve Chen, who left Cray last
year to start a company called Supercomputer Systems Inc.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the 1964 Good Friday earthquake sent
a flood of water to wash away its homes and heart, Valdez turned
its back on the sea.
   Mindful of the water's treachery that killed 33 of its
neighbors, the city relocated three miles inland behind a
protective hump of hills. Its fishing fleet destroyed, its civic
consciousness turned inland to the road to Anchorage and the
promise that the trans-Alaska oil pipeline would pump new life into
the community.
   A half-dozen inlets and mountain ridges to the east, the city of
Cordova suffered far less. The quake did milder damage, shaking
down the Million Dollar Bridge, a railroad trestle being converted
to carry highway traffic.
   The loss ended attempts to link the fishing village to the land.
That was just fine for many Cordova residents who believe their
collective soul is tied to the blue waters of Orca Inlet and the
rich herring and salmon schools in Prince William Sound.
   Twenty-five Good Fridays later the Exxon Valdez ran aground and
ripped its hull on Bligh Reef, a hardluck spot close to the
epicenter of the 1964 earthquake.
   The resulting spill of 10.1 million gallons of oil has had a
very different impact on the two cities.
   Valdez has been the focus of world concern about the oil spill,
receiving full-page newspaper apologies from Exxon. It's become a
boom town, its hotels and restaurants crowded with oil people,
military and media. Exxon has rented an office building and will be
a presence for the years the cleanup will take, pumping money into
the local economy.
   ``This means millions for us,'' said Jan Buccini, a Valdez
cabbie who says his payday is triple that of pre-spill days. ``This
town is going to grow.''
   But Cordova, which fought against the trans-Alaska pipeline and
the tankers it brought to Prince William Sound, is in shock. An
anticipated $12 million herring harvest has been canceled and
favorite fishing grounds are cesspools. Cordova got no official
apology and little money from Exxon.
   ``We're devastated,'' said Linden Colour O'Toole, who has
handled an emergency hotline since the oil spill. ``People are
scared and hurt. They're afraid the world has forgotten about us.''
   In normal times, Cordova would be a busy place. Its 1,200-boat
marina would be crowded with gill netters, seiners and support
ships. The canneries would be going and the half dozen bars on
First Street would be bustling. There'd be money in everyone's
pocket after the long winter's hibernation.
   But instead the town is quiet. The bars are empty and flags fly
at half mast. The marina is half filled; many of the boats are in
the sound warring with the oil slick.
   ``No fishing, no business. No business, no economy. No economy,
no Cordova,'' said Bob Van Brucklin, who owns a bar, laundry, motel
and warehouse.
   Many people attend meeting after meeting, worrying at the future
while trying to deal with working on the cleanup for Exxon.
   ``The problem with the fishermen is we're used to going out and
doing our own work,'' said Jerry McCune, president of the Cordova
District Fishermen United. ``Now we have to take Exxon jobs and sit
here and wonder what's going to happen to the salmon fishery.''
   The adults aren't the only ones hurting. Cordova's children, use
to otters and killer whales in the inlet and bald eagles in the
sky, have been traumatized by the spill's carnage.
   Linden O'Toole told of her 3-year-old son seeing a box of dead,
oiled birds brought in by a fisherman. ``He kept saying, `I want to
go `safe' the birds. I want to go `safe' the birds,''' she said.
   Whatever happens now, the future of Valdez is assured by the
800-mile oil pipeline that fills tankers like the Exxon Valdez. Tax
revenue from it provides 92 percent of the city's $31 million
budget, a budget 10 times that of Cordova.
   The fishermen of Cordova opposed the pipeline.
   Some of the ``old-towners,'' the pre-earthquake Valdez
residents, share Cordova's concerns. Pat Day, whose family has
fished for four generations, fears the effects of the spill and is
frustrated by the attitude of some fellow townspeople.
   ``What I hear is, `nature will take care of it,''' said Day. ``I
think she probably will, but it will take 30 years.''

<HEAD>Drop In 1st Quarter Merger Business May Be Fluke</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you go by the numbers, U.S. mergers and
acquisitions fell sharply in the first quarter of 1989 compared
with the frenzy of last year, but experts say the figures are
misleading and the outlook for more takeovers is good.
   ``I don't see this as anything but a fluctuation,'' said Louis
Lowenstein, professor of corporate finance at Columbia University's
School of Law. ``Nothing fundamental has changed.''
   The numbers _ at least on the surface _ indicate merger activity
slowed from January through March. Mergers and corporate
transactions announced during the first quarter fell to 340 from
410 in the same period of 1988, according to statistics compiled by
Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., research firm.
   The transactions include include recapitalizations and stock
buybacks.
   The dollar value of the deals also plunged, to $74.36 billion in
the latest quarter from $137.17 billion a year earlier, Securities
Data said.
   But the people who follow merger activity attach little
significance to the figures.
   ``It's much too short a period from which to draw any
conclusions,'' said Isaac Shapiro, a partner in the law firm
Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, which has a large practice in
mergers and acquisitions.
   ``I don't think quarter to quarter statistics mean a lot,''
Shapiro said.
   Donald Margotta, an assistant professor at Northeastern
University in Boston, agreed, saying, ``It's not significant
enough.''
   ``It's simply cyclical activity,'' Margotta said. ``Mergers have
gone through cycles _ there are lows and there are peaks.''
   Furthermore, there's no reason for merger activity to fall off,
the professor said.
   ``The basic forces driving the market are still there,''
Lowenstein said.
   Recent developments support his statement. Gulf &amp; Western Inc.
announced this weekend it was in the market for acquisitions, and
Beatrice Cos. also says it is looking for companies to buy.
   Securities Data reported the number of acquisitions declined as
``the investment banking industry regrouped in the wake of the
landmark deals of the previous year.''
   The company referred to the record $24.53 billion buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the $12.9 billion
acquisition of Kraft Inc. by Philip Morris Cos. and other big deals.
   Lowenstein acknowledged that ``the system was absorbing RJR,''
but said that should not have affected overall activity.
   Interest rates moved higher during the first quarter, but
Lowenstein also dismissed that as a possible factor.
   ``That has not chilled mergers in the past,'' he said, noting
that when interest rates soared in the early 1980s, ``mergers went
along at a splendid clip.''
   Merger activity hit an all-time high in 1988, with Securities
Data reporting 2,994 transactions totaling $365.09 billion.
   Many analysts said last year that acquirers were moving up their
deals to take advantage of the Reagan administration's relatively
lenient attitude toward mergers.
   Lowenstein discounted that theory as a factor in the
first-quarter drop-off.
   ``That would have accounted for some deals that had antitrust
implications ... but you're talking about such a high level of
activity,'' he said.
   The Securities Data report also noted a downturn in foreign
merger activity in the United States, with the number of
first-quarter acquisitions valued at $100 million and more falling
to 27 from 30. The dollar value of the deals fell to $10.86 billion
from $28.01 billion.
   But, said Shapiro, a specialist in foreign mergers, ``I really
don't think it tells you much of anything.''
   ``The fundamentals remain the same,'' Shapiro said. ``As long as
the dollar remains at its relatively low value ... U.S. assets
continue to be attractive.''
   Securities Data said the number of big U.S. acquisitions by
Japanese concerns also slipped during the first three months of the
year, but Shapiro again did not see any trend.
   ``The Japanese have enormous liquidity,'' and they and other
foreign acquirers remain interested in U.S. properties, he said.

   The dollar traded in a narrow, mostly higher,
range in Europe today and foreign currency dealers said they saw
little impetus for it to move. Gold prices also rose.
   ``I haven't seen the dollar move since I came in this morning,''
said one trader in Rome. ``I don't see much space to move the
dollar higher, but there's also no reason for it to go down.''
   Another trader said the dollar may be able to break out of its

February and producer prices for March.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day

   In Zurich, the bid price was $384.30, up from $381.50 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.87 to close at a bid $386.37.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded

a stock scandal reassured Japanese investors, dealers said.

day's 132.53-yen finish. It opened at 132.87 yen and ranged between
132.60 yen and 132.89 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 186.03 points on
Monday, shot up today by 250.56 points, or 0.76 percent, closing at
33,249.58.
   ``Early morning trading started amid a cautious mood concerning
what Prime Minister Takeshita was going to say before Parliament,''
said Kenji Ishizuka with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   ``But the index started to rise as participants discovered
Takeshita said nothing worse than what had already been
disclosed,'' he added.
   Volume traded on the first section in the first hour was only
200 million shares, but activity quickened later, and the full
day's estimated volume was 1.1 billion shares, Ishizuka said.
   Addressing Parliament Tuesday morning, Takeshita said he had
received 130 million yen (about $1 million) in donations from
Recruit Co., the firm at the heart of a major stock-profiteering
and bribery scandal.
   But he denied taking bribes and continued to reject opposition
calls for his resignation.
   Investors were more or less reassured as Takeshita said nothing
new, while agreeing to give a parliamentary committee records of
donations and stock profits he and his office have received,
Ishizuka said.
   Opposition parties have halted parliamentary proceedings,
demanding a full accounting of ruling Liberal Democratic Party
politicians' involvement in the scandal.
   In currency dealings, there was some yen buying as exchange
market participants also were reassured by Takeshita's remarks,
said a dealer with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He said the exchange rate was likely to change little in the
next few days as the market awaits the release of major indicators
for the U.S. economy later this week.
   The United States is to announce the nation's trade figures for
February and wholesale price index for March.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told parliament
today that he received $1 million from the company at the center of
a highly damaging bribery scandal, but he rejected opposition
demands that he resign.
   Takeshita's statement was a reversal of earlier comments that he
had not received money from Recruit Co., an information and
publishing conglomerate.
   ``I am feeling my political and moral responsibilities very
strongly,'' he told parliament's budget committee. ``I think it is
important to settle this matter legally and politically as soon as
possible.''
   A series of recent news reports linking Takeshita to Recruit had
prompted the prime minister to explain his role in the widening
scandal.
   ``I am aware the Recruit scandal is the most serious matter I
have ever experienced in the 38 years of my political career,'' he
said during the nationally televised committee hearing.
   ``Political reform is essential to overcome the current
situation and restore public trust in politics.''
   Takeshita said Recruit and its subsidiaries gave about $1
million between 1985 and 1987 to his political organizations in the
form of donations and purchases of fund-raising party tickets while
he was finance minister and secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The prime minister said the money was treated as political
donations, not bribes.
   Asked by opposition lawmaker Kanji Kawasaki of the Japan
Socialist Party what his understanding was of Recruit's intention
in making such large donations, Takeshita replied: ``I am not in a
position of telling the intent of another party's political
donations.''
   In the scandal, Recruit sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted
shares in a real-estate subsidiary to about 160 political, business
and government officials at low prices.
   Buyers of the shares received handsome profits when the stock
value soared shortly after being listed on the over-the-counter
market.
   Takeshita has acknowledged that a former aide and relative
bought shares for a profit of about $190,000. But he denied
personal involvement in the transactions.
   To opposition charges that he had reversed his earlier
statements, Takeshita said: ``I do not remember the details of my
statement, but I probably did not have clear recollections of the
matter then.''
   In October, Takeshita told Japan's Diet, or parliament: ``I have
never received funds or whatsoever from Recruit.''
   The scandal has prompted the opposition to demand that Takeshita
resign and call elections to allow the public to give its verdict
on the scandal. Some members of his party also want him to step
down.
   ``Your resignation is the only way to save Japan's democracy,''
said Kawasaki. ``You are not entitled to discuss political reforms.
Your hand is contaminated with Recruit money.''
   Japanese politicians long have relied on substantial donations
from corporations, both for campaign expenses and for the kind of
gift-giving that has become a custom. Politicians say, for example,
they are expected to send gifts for constituents' weddings,
funerals and other occasions.
   Because of widespread gift-giving, links between gifts and
favors generally are not clear. But the media long have criticized
the close links between business and government.
   Proposed reforms would require a clearer public accounting of
donations.
   Three people resigned from Takeshita's Cabinet after
acknowledging they continued to receive Recruit donations after the
scandal broke last summer. Takeshita said he did not receive
Recruit money after 1987, the year he became prime minister.
   He declined to answer opposition questions about how he would
take responsibility if more allegations linking him to the Recruit
were revealed.
   ``But at this point, I do not anticipate anything of that sort
will come out,'' he said.
   So far, 14 people, including two former vice ministers, have
been arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in
the Recruit scandal.
   The investigation is continuing and several politicians are
being questioned by authorities.
   Opposition parties said they suspect Takeshita's donations from
Recruit may violate the law governing political donations.
Companies of Recruit's size are only allowed to donate $113,636
annually to a politician.
   Also, if it was substantiated that Takeshita, as the finance
minister, provided the firm with favors in return for donations, he
will become subject to bribery laws.
   Public support for Takeshita in opinion polls has declined to
all-time lows. One poll released Monday showed Takeshita's approval
rate at just 7.8 percent.

   Stock prices slipped in early trading Tuesday but
regained some ground as bargain hunters moved into the market.
   Dealers said prices initially declined on mounting interest rate
fears and concerns over the general health of the British economy.
   However, some market watchers said a handful of institutions
could not resist picking up some selected issues once the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index approached the 2,000-point
level.
   Several market makers also said a strong performance by the
British pound kept fears of imminent interest rate hikes at bay.
The firmer pound gave the market renewed confidence, one market
maker suggested.
   At midday, the FT-SE index was off 5.5 points, or 0.2 percent,
at 2,019.5. Earlier, the index was down more than 23 points.
   Volume amounted to a modest 322.7 million shares by midday,
compared with 257.7 million shares at the same time Monday.

<HEAD>Southwest Airlines Report Features Punch-Out Fun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In addition to the facts and figures formally
found in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988
features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the
most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said Tim
McClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agency
GSD&amp;M, which designed the report.
   The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95
million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble
Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out last year
during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texas
and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually
painted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''
   Even though Southwest previously has taken a light approach to
its reports, McClure said it was a little difficult this year to
sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someone
punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''
   He said he persuaded Southwest that the unusual idea would
become enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up
for one.''
   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really
shows the personality that Southwest is,'' McClure said.
   Southwest, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,
is based at Love Field near downtown Dallas and operates a
distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.

<HEAD>CFTC Charges 22 Traders in Alleged Bond Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two Chicago traders face large fines and
possible suspension for their alleged roles in a scheme to
pre-arrange trades for U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the traders
executed a series of transactions with Robert J. Griffin, a floor
broker on the Chicago Board of Trade, between July 10 and 24, 1986,
that ``were of the character of ... fictitious sales and that as a
result ... all of the traders caused prices to be reported that
were not true.''
   The six-count complaint disclosed Monday in Washington also
charged Griffin, who was trading on behalf of customers, with
fraud, alleging that his customers suffered losses because he
traded with the other 21 traders rather than file the orders
competitively.
   Griffin's attorney, Matt Lydon, denied the CFTC charges.
   ``The trades were executed at prices which were the best
attainable by the customers,'' Lydon said.
   The CFTC said a hearing before an administrative law judge would
be scheduled. The accused traders face possible penalties ranging
from fines of $100,000 per violation to revocation or suspension of
their licenses and trading privileges.
   The CFTC charges follow disclosures a few months ago that the
FBI was winding down a two-year undercover probe of alleged
wrongdoing among traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I think the CFTC is pressing on this because of the FBI
investigation,'' one trader named in the complaint told the Chicago
Tribune. His name was not printed.
   ``They are trying to use this as a ploy to show Congress that it
(the CFTC) is a necessary agency,'' another trader named in the
complaint told the newspaper.
   Mark Prout, a spokesman for the Board of Trade, said after the
exchange became aware of the investigation in May 1988, it asked
the CFTC for permission to take over the probe, but received no
reply.
   Those named in the complaint were:
   John K. Angelo, Hinsdale, Ill.; Leonard Cahnmann and Roy E.
Erickson, Northbrook, Ill.; Terrence M. Corby, Brian D. Fox, George
D. Leventis, Yossi Morik, Peggy Anne Ogorek, Keith M. Rudman,
Thomas M. Schwarz, Pemberton H. Shober Jr. and George Tomlinson,
Chicago; Ronald J. Cohen, Arlington Heights, Ill.; Edmund J.
Conroy, Willowbrook, Ill.; Robert D. Furst Jr., Deephaven, Minn.;
Robert J. Griffin, Winnetka, Ill.; Terrence P. Madden, LaGrange,
Ill.; Bruce A. Nixon, Long Grove, Ill.; Anthony J. Roti, Glenview,

<HEAD>Merger Worth $60 A Share To Holly Farms Stockholders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. stockholders would get
1.875 shares of ConAgra Inc. stock for each of their Holly Farms
shares if a proposed merger between the two firms goes through, the
companies announced.
   The exchange agreed upon Monday would be worth $60 a share to
Holly Farms stockholders, or a total of $1.08 billion for the
company, based on Monday's closing market prices.
   In an attempt to fend off a buyout by rival poultry producer
Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark., Holly Farms announced plans
last November to merge with with ConAgra.
   The tentative stock exchange rate was set then at between 1.875
and 2 shares of ConAgra stock for each Holly Farms share traded.
The exchange rate was settled in anticipation of meetings Friday
during which Holly Farms and ConAgra shareholders will vote on the
merger proposal.
   Tyson is offering Holly Farms stockholders $63.50 a share in
cash, or a total of $1.1 billion, but Holly Farms managers are
urging shareholders to reject it.
   Holly Farms president R. Lee Taylor II said the ConAgra proposal
would be a better deal for Holly Farms shareholders.
   ``It gives stockholders an equity interest in a company that
should be strategically the best performing food company in the
United States,'' he said.
   Tyson has turned to full-page newspaper advertisements to urge
Holly Farms employees who are stockholders to reject the ConAgra
merger.
   In advertisements published Sunday in editions of The Commercial
Appeal at Memphis, the Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina, and
The Des Moines Register, Tyson touted its $63.50-a-share offer and
criticized the proposed stock-for-stock offer by the Omaha-based
ConAgra.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Legislation Lifting Controls on Natural Gas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with panel approving legislation; picks up 5th
graf pvs, The House.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee today
approved legislation to lift the remaining price controls on
natural gas, which accounts for one-quarter of the nation's energy
supply.
   Before a voice vote to send the bill to the House floor, several
panel members said the decontrol would help ease the nation's
growing dependence on imported energy without raising consumers'
heating bills.
   ``I think gas prices are going to fall'' in the short run if the
legislation is enacted, said Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La.
   Prospects for full congressional approval appeared better than
at any time in this decade. Worries about price rises had blocked
attempts to end the controls.
   Industry officials and analysts say the legislation could result
in slight declines in consumer prices, but any immediate effect is
likely to be small because most of the controlled gas already sells
at prices below the federally set ceilings.
   The House measure is strongly supported by all segments of the
natural gas industry and by the Bush administration, which views
price decontrol as a way of promoting natural gas as a
cleaner-burning alternative to oil. President Bush has expressed
concern at the country's growing reliance on imported oil.
   Some consumer groups, however, say ending limits on how much
producers may charge on about one-third of the nation's gas supply
will help the industry without tackling problems of greater concern
to the 48 million households that use gas.
   ``Simple natural gas decontrol can do no good for the
residential ratepayer,'' said Mark Cooper, research director for
the Consumer Federation of America. ``It probably won't do much
harm, but there are a lot of other things that could be done'' to
protect consumers from the effects of rules changes.
   Cooper's group and other consumer advocates say that while
market forces are keeping natural gas prices low, Congress should
be focusing more attention on supply issues. One such problem,
called ``take-or-pay,'' is forcing consumers to help pay off
long-term supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s
when, unlike today, supplies were tight and prices were rising.
   The average price for residential users in 1987, the latest year
for which official government estimates are available, was $5.56
per thousand cubic feet, down from a peak of $6.12 in 1985. In 1979
the average price was $2.98 per thousand cubic feet.
   The price decontrol bill was introduced by Rep. Philip R. Sharp,
D-Ind., and co-sponsored by 22 of the 23 members of a House Energy
subcommittee that approved it last week. No action has been taken
yet on a similar bill in the Senate.
   The House billcalls for price decontrol to be completed by Jan.
1, 1993. In the interim, price controls would be lifted from gas
not subject to a contract on the date of the legislation's
enactment as well as certain other gas.
   Sharp in past years had opposed lifting price controls on gas,
as had Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, who once said decontrol would occur ``over my
dead body,'' but who now supports the Sharp bill.
   The switch in their views is an acknowledgement of changes in
the industry's structure since gas deregulation was started by the
1978 Natural Gas Policy Act. That measure removed price limits on
certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen categories
of gas, each with a federally set ceiling price.
   The collapse of crude oil prices in 1986, coupled with the
effects of other market and regulatory changes, led to falling gas
prices, excess supplies and greatly increased competition _ both
within the industry and with other fuels.
   The Reagan administration, which had accelerated the decontrol
of oil prices as one of its first official acts in 1981, never came
close to winning congressional support for gas decontrol. The Bush
administration has vowed to lobby hard on the issue.
   ``You can be assured it is a major issue with the president
himself,'' Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told a House panel
last month. ``We will support it and support it in a major way.''

<TEXT>
   Scott Paper Co. announced Tuesday it will
sell 194,000 acres of timberlands in western Washington to Crown
Pacific Ltd. for about $230 million.
   Scott first announced plans to sell its northwest timberlands in
1983, and the agreement with Crown represents all but about 16,000
acres of the land to be sold.
   ``As we indicated in 1983, our northwest timberlands are best
suited for producing lumber and building materials products which
are not strategic directions for Scott,'' Scott chairman Philip E.
Lippincott said.
   Pulp and paper manufacturing at Scott's Everett, Wash. mill,
which typically receives only a small amount of its wood fiber from
the northwest timberlands, will not be affected.
   The agreement calls for Crown Pacific, of Portland, Ore., to
supply wood fiber to the mill from the purchased land.
   The sale, which is subject to approval by Scott's board of
directors, is expected to be completed this summer.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On Report Of Declining Crop Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices moved moderately higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade on signs of a deteriorating
winter wheat crop. Corn and soybean futures were narrowly mixed.
   In its weekly report on crop conditions, released Monday after
the markets closed, the Agriculture Department found a net decline
in the condition of the winter wheat crop during the week ended
Sunday.
   The finding was somewhat surprising since a recent increase in
precipitation in some key wheat-growing areas had led many traders
to expect an overall improvement in the crop.
   Corn futures prices were slightly lower in early trading, due in
part to slack export demand.
   Slow foreign demand also limited early gains in the soybean
market, but higher cash prices and strengthening chart signals
provided a generally bullish tone.
   Cautious trading was expected ahead of the USDA's monthly grain
supply-and-demand report, which was due out after the close today.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 5} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.66\ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower with May at $1.86{ a bushel; soybeans
were unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $7.20 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed while pork bellies were slightly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .47 cent lower with April at 77.70
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with
April at 77.30 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with April at 39.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.17 cent to .30 cent lower with May at 33.90 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Monday while pork futures
were mixed.

   ``The market is going to languish in volume with little

the economy. Although the jobless rate slid to 5 percent, fewer
than 100,000 new jobs were created.
   The government is scheduled to report on producer prices,
merchandise trade, retail sales and industrial production.
   ``If there was just one, I don't think the market would be
focusing in as much or as hard as it is,'' Puccio said. ``But when
they come in a cluster like this, I don't think the market can
ignore them.''

   A House panel today amended President Bush's
savings and loan bailout plan to ensure that companies which bought
failed S&amp;Ls with federal aid last year do not suffer any losses if
the assistance is cut off.
   But it rejected an effort by liberal Democrats to make both S&amp;Ls
and commercial banks reflect on their books the market value of
real estate and Third World loans whose value has declined
substantially because borrowers are not repaying them.
   With a two-month honeymoon disintegrating into a kitchen
squabble over who takes out the trash and whose friends get invited
to supper, the House Banking Committee's financial institutions
subcommittee began tackling the most controversial issues in Bush's
$90 billion bailout proposal.
   On a 31-14 vote, the panel rejected an amendment by Rep. Joseph
P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., to make financial institutions list loans
as assets only at the level for which they could be sold to others,
rather than their original value when issued.
   ``There's no reason why banks and thrifts cannot be held to the
discipline of the market ... and not hold on their books loans at
values which are greatly in excess of what they're worth,'' Kennedy
said. ``That's why we are in the trouble that we are today.''
   Much of the magnitude of the S&amp;L bailout has been blamed on
congressionally approved accounting practices that allowed thrifts
to effectively hide the deterioration of souring loans in their
portfolios from regulators.
   ``We keep hearing about the need for certainty and stability,''
said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn. ``This would formalize that process.
If you want to get tough, this certainly gets tough.''
   Critics, however, contended that such a radical change in
financial accounting practices might hurt both banks and S&amp;Ls
dramatically.
   ``If we were in a new world and starting from scratch, it would
be appropriate,'' said Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.
   The panel approved on a 35-7 vote a measure by Rep. Doug
Barnard, D-Ga., that would protect holding companies who bought ill
S&amp;Ls last year with the promise of government aid from having to
absorb the costs if those insitutions fail because the assistance
is cut off.
   Barnard said the measure was aimed at preventing other S&amp;Ls
under a holding company's umbrella from also failing because of a
government failure to live up to the aid agreements.
   But Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
complained that the amendment would create a large loophole for
holding companies to skirt any liability if the once-failed thrifts
go under again.
   The panel had yet to tackle the much tougher capital standards
that Bush and bankers want to place on S&amp;Ls and an off-budget
financing scheme that has drawn the opposition of House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   To discourage risky loans blamed for much of the current crisis,
Bush would require S&amp;L owners to put up 6 percent capital _ or $6
of their own money for every $100 they lend _ by June 1991. Those
who don't could not make additional loans with federally insured
deposits.
   But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
and Barnard have an amendment that would require S&amp;Ls to
effectively have only 1.5 percent ``tangible'' capital in relation
to total outstanding loans.
   Many S&amp;Ls already fail to meet the current 3 percent capital
requirement. Many others meet the requirement only because of
widely criticized but federally approved accounting practices,
which allow them to count ``good will'' from gestures such as
taking over even weaker institutions in the past at the
government's behest.
   A subcommittee aide, asking that his name not be used, said the
capital alternative proposed by Annunzio and Barnard is tougher in
some ways than Bush's standard because it narrows the range of
acceptable accounting practices. But he also acknowledged it would
be much easier for S&amp;Ls to meet the 1.5 percent target.
   The issue is considered critical for 300 to 400 marginally
solvent S&amp;Ls, and industry officials have said as many as one-half
of the nation's 3,000 savings institutions could have trouble
meeting Bush's proposed standards.
   Banks already are subject to the 6 percent capital requirement,
and they strongly endorse making S&amp;Ls meet the same standard. They
also back provisions in Bush's bill that would end prohibitions
against bank ownership of thrift institutions.
   But even Republicans on the House Banking Committee have joined
in the chorus criticizing the latter, predicting it will create a
``feeding frenzy'' of banks preying upon S&amp;Ls.

   White House and congressional budget writers,
with deadlines slipping away, pushed today to finish their talks on
a compromise spending and tax package for next year.
   ``We're hoping to come to an agreement but we haven't made it,''
said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the
House Budget Committee, as he entered today's meeting.
   ``When we get one issue resolved, we run into another,'' said
Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., Frenzel's Senate counterpart, who
said he was still optimistic.
   The bargainers have been meeting behind closed doors for more
than a month in search of a compromise plan for reducing the
federal deficit to $100 billion next year, as required by the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   Several of the group's own, informal deadlines for actions have
passed. With some more significant ones looming, including
Congress' April 15 deadline for passing a budget resolution, the
negotiators were pressing to finish today.
   A budget pact would be formally announced at a White House
meeting. But without agreement today that was unlikely until next
week because President Bush is leaving town.
   Based on latest estimates and Bush's $1.16 trillion spending
plan, about $28 billion in deficit reduction is required. The group
has agreed that about half would come from spending restraints and
half from raising revenues.
   The revenues include roughly $3.4 billion from selling
government assets, $5.2 billion from raising various fees for
government services and some $5.6 billion would be in unspecified
new taxes _ but presumably none that President Bush would concede
violate his campaign promise for no new taxes.
   More than $7 billion in savings would be made by restraining
entitlement programs _ those requiring direct benefit payments to
individuals _ including more than $2.5 billion trimmed from the
expected growth in Medicare costs.
   Monday's session was dedicated to deciding generally where cuts
in non-entitlement government programs would be made, at the
Pentagon and at domestic agencies, according to participants who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with
inflation, while domestic programs _ other than his own initiatives
_ would be frozen at the previous year's levels. Democrats in the
talks have proposed trimming back defense growth so that more
domestic demands can be met.
   The bargainers traded offers Monday toward a possible compromise
on those and on the small but also politically sensitive foreign
aid budget.
   Bush has personally contacted at least one lawmaker to lobby
against cuts in foreign aid _ a program now administered by his old
friend, Secretary of State James Baker, who appeared before the
negotiators early in the talks.
   Congress has a self-imposed April 15 deadline for producing a
budget resolution and even if agreement is reached quickly, that
deadline will be missed by weeks.
   Even if the negotiators complete their task this week, the House
and Senate budget committees must draft more detailed spending
plans for each chamber to consider. Then, the two chambers would
need to approve a single, compromise plan.
   The budget, which does not require the president's signature,
serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax legislation
for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   If Congress and the president don't by then bring down the
deficit to within $10 billion of the $100 billion goal, the
administration is required under the Gramm-Rudman law to order
across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

   The billionare Pritzker family said today it has
cut its stake in Ramada Inc. to 4.8 percent from 7.2 percent,
indicating the Arizona-based hotelier has won a fight to remain
independent.
   HCC Corp., a Chicago-based company headed by Jay A. Pritzker,
said in an April 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission it had sold a total of 959,100 shares of Ramada stock
from March 16 through April 5 at an average price of $11.29 a share.
   Ramada stock was trading at $11.62{ in early New York Stock
Exchange trading today.
   Pritzker would not comment on the reasons for the stock sale,
said his secretary, Rhonda Scheiss.
   Last September, Ramada rejected HCC's $10-a-share offer for all
of the company's stock and embarked on a corporate restructuring
that included the sale of its 825 hotels.
   Ramada plans to retain its hotel-casino operations in New Jersey
and Nevada and is still seeking a buyer for its hotels, said
spokesman Joe Cole from company headquarters in Phoenix, Ariz.
   Cole said Ramada had heard nothing from the Pritzkers since
October, ``so I don't think we have any comment on what they've
just done.''

<TEXT>
   The Philippines could drop a lawsuit
against Westinghouse Electric Corp. over an allegedly defective
nuclear power plant if the U.S. company helps provide alternate
power, an official said Tuesday.
   The government of President Corazon Aquino claims the
620-megawatt plant rests on an earthquake fault and has structural
defects.
   ``Of course we are seeking recovery of damages, but damages ...
can be paid in services and facilities,'' Justice Secretary Sedfrey
Ordonez said in a television interview.
   The $2.3 billion plant on the Bataan peninsula, 60 miles west of
Manila, was completed in 1985 several months before President
Ferdinand Marcos was driven into exile. The plant was never started.
   The Aquino government sued Westinghouse, its subsidiary
Westinghouse International Projects Inc., and contractors Burns and
Roe Enterprises Inc., in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., last
December.
   The Philippines government also accused Westinghouse of bribing
Marcos to win the contract to build the plant. The suit is intended
to cancel the contract and recover the money spent on the plant. It
also seeks unspecified damages.
   Westinghouse has denied the bribery charges and claims the plant
is safe.
   Ordonez said an out-of-court settlement was ``not out of the
picture.''
   ``Our concern now is to develop alternate sources of energy,''
he said. ``If that can be met, the money aspect can be minimized.
What is important is that we get something for the same value which
would help us solve our power needs.''
   A Justice Department source said the remarks were hypothetical.
Philippine and Westinghouse officials held lengthy negotiations
before the decision to file the suit.
   Ordonez was interviewed after Salvador Laurel, Mrs. Aquino's
estranged vice president, called on the administration to operate
the plant because of the country's power shortage.
   Ordonez and Mrs. Aquino said they did not understand Laurel's
position because the vice president voted with the cabinet in 1986
to close the plant. Laurel quit as foreign secretary in 1987 and
joined the political opposition last year.
   ``According to our lawyers, we have sufficient evidence in the
matter of proving that we got a raw deal from Westinghouse,'' Mrs.
Aquino said Monday.
   Robert F. Pugliese, a Westinghouse executive vice president,
said in a statement released in Pittsburgh that the company was
willing ``to explore how we can help bring the Philippine nuclear
power plant into service.''
   ``We are confident we built a safe plant,'' he said. ``Prior to
its mothballing by the Philippines government, it had passed every
official inspection of its readiness to load, fuel and begin
startup testing.''
   In Newark, attorneys for the Philippine government asked U.S.
District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise to have the case heard in
federal court. Westinghouse asked the judge to send the case to
arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   Philippines' attorney Mark Augenblick said a contract clause
prescribing arbitration of disputes is invalid because the
state-run National Power Corp. was forced to sign the agreement.

<TEXT>
   Construction contracting will fall about 3
percent in 1989, pulled down by sharp drops in office and other
commercial instruction, a forecast released Tuesday says.
   A glut of commercial space on the market and rising interest
rates are the main reasons for the projected decline, according to
the Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook by McGraw-Hill Information
Systems Co.
   Total construction contracting is expected to fall to $247.4
billion from $255.2 billion, according to the forecast, which is an
update from the original 1989 outlook released last October.
   Among particular segments, McGraw-Hill projected a 7 percent
drop in non-residential construction contracting, a 2 percent drop
in residential construction contracting, and a 2 percent increase
in non-building construction, such as construction for
transportation, environment and utilities.

   Stock prices were trading near session highs in
relatively slim volume as many market participants remained on the

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 11.36 to 2,313.23

   Analysts said speculative buying helped push the market higher,

   ``There is some anticipatory nibbling with people watching the

<HEAD>Coffee Export Quota Cut to Shore Up Falling Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Coffee Organization cut its
global export quota by 351,000 bags Tuesday to shore up falling
prices.
   The cut in the October 1988-September 1989 quota was triggered
automatically by a fall in the average coffee price below $1.15 a
pound. One bag equals 132 pounds.
   The coffee organization's 15-day composite indicator for Monday,
calculated on Tuesday, dropped to $1.1498 from $1.1523 on Friday.
   The organization, made up of coffee producer and consumer
nations, has set a target price for coffee of $1.20-$1.40.
   In February, it twice cut the global export quota when the
average price fell below $1.20 a pound.
   The three cuts affect only the quotas of countries producing the
poorer grade robusta beans, principally the Ivory Coast, Uganda and
Indonesia. The organization wants to boost supplies of the prized
arabica beans grown throughout Latin America.
   Only if the price of arabica falls from its current level of
$1.40 a pound to under $1.30 will arabica producers face a
reduction in their export quotas.
   The robusta producers affected by Tuesday's cut, with the size
of the reduction in parentheses, are Cameroon (38,500 bags),
Indonesia (78,000), Ivory Coast (101,500), Madagascar (20,000),
Philippines (13,000), Uganda (67,000) and Zaire (33,000).

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Advance On Crop-Damage Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weather-damage fears drove wheat futures prices
to a moderately higher close Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed.
   The gain in wheat prices was partly a reaction to the
Agriculture Department's weekly report issued after the close
Monday showing a net decline in the condition of the winter wheat
crop for the week ending Sunday.
   Dry conditions in the Great Plains were cited for the
deterioration, and the cold weather of the past three days added to
traders' crop-damage fears.
   ``The weather's a little nippy, to put it mildly, in some areas,
slowing development of wheat by about two weeks,'' said Katharina
Zimmer, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   She said other buying was prompted by perceptions that the steep
decline in wheat prices over the past two weeks was not entirely
warranted.
   Corn and soybean futures closed mixed in cautious trading ahead
of the USDA's monthly supply-and-demand report.
   In that report, the USDA revised upward its estimates for
1988-89 corn and wheat ending stocks but let stand its estimate for
1988-89 soybean ending stocks.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.00{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
lower to { cent higher with May at $2.65\ a bushel; oats were 1\

   The stock market rose in fairly quiet trading
today with many investors cautious ahead of the barrage of economic
data due out this week.
   The producer price index, which serves as a gauge of
inflationary pressures, is scheduled for release on Friday along
with reports on merchandise trade and industrial production.
   Analysts said recession-sensitive stocks like foods and soaps,
which have shown steady gains in the last few weeks, continued to
do well. A number of other sectors, including high technology,
entertainment and toys, also performed surprisingly well despite
the low volume, they said.
   Many analysts in the financial world believe economic growth has
begun to slow since the start of the year.
   The employment report last Friday provided mixed signals about
the economy. Although the jobless rate slid to 5 percent, fewer
than 100,000 new jobs were created.
   Market participants are looking to the new data to provide a

   NCNB Corp., which recently emerged as an unwelcome bidder for
the Atlanta-based bank holding company Citizens and Southern Corp.,
reported Tuesday that its first-quarter profit jumped 8 percent
over a year ago.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $75.8
million, or 82 cents a share, compared with earnings of $70.02
million, or 83 cents per share, in 1988.
   Chairman Hugh McColl attributed the improvement partly to a rise
in net interest income and strong loan growth.
   The results included $10.8 million in earnings contributions
from NCNB Texas, formerly First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, of
which NCNB owns a 20 percent stake. They also included $5 million
in dividends on convertible preferred stock issued to fund the
investment.
   Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB took over the management of the First
RepublicBank banks last year after getting financial assistance
from the government.
   NCNB grabbed the attention of the banking industry earlier this
month by making an unsolicited $2.4 billion stock-swap buyout for
Citizens. The company has rejected the bid as inadequate and urged
NCNB to withdraw it.
   The combination of the two banks would result in a bank with
assets of around $75 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10 among
the nation's bank holding companies.

   A defense contractor has agreed to
pay $1 million in fines and damages for selling the government
critical bomb components that employees knew were defective, a
prosecutor said Tuesday.
   Allied-Signal Inc., parent company of Courter Operations of
Boyne City, agreed to the settlement fter a three-year
investigation resulting in conviction of seven ex-Courter
employees, U.S. Attorney John Smietanka said.
   The company, which also is parent company of Bendix Guidance
Systems, agreed to pay the government $1 million to resolve its
liability under the False Claims Act for possible fines and
damages, Smietanka said in a statement.
   The payment was received April 4 and the case was closed, he
said.
   The Defense Department probe began after Courter employees were
reported to have routinely falsified test data to hide instances in
which critical aviation components failed to meet quality standards.
   In a May 1986 court-ordered search of Courter testing records,
Air Force investigators found that about 1,500 defective or
substandard sophisticated gyroscopes had been sent from Courter to
Texas Instruments Inc., to be placed in Air Force laser-guided
glide bombs.
   When the fraud was detected, some suspect gyroscopes already had
been assembled into the bombs and sent to Air Force depots.
   Allied-Signal, based in Morristown, N.J., which cooperated in
the investigation, recalled all defective components and paid Texas
Instruments $2.4 million related to the recall.
   Seven ex-Courter employees pleaded guilty to related federal
conspiracy and fraud charges. Six of the employees, who cooperated
with the government, received a sentence of probation.
   Former plant manager Ralph Iadarola was indicted by a grand jury
on two felony charges and received a three-year prison sentence,
which was suspended. He also was fined $10,000, ordered to perform
600 hours of community service and placed on probation.

   The dollar finished firmer against most major
currencies except the Japanese yen Tuesday, pushed aloft by
favorable market sentiment toward the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices edged lower in U.S. trading, reversing course after
moving up on markets overseas. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $384.90 for a troy ounce of gold, down from
Monday's late bid of $385.20.
   The dollar's increase came despite intervention by the Federal
Reserve. Dealers in New York said the U.S. central bank sold
dollars at one point but the dollar ended the day near its highest
levels of the session anyway.
   Bob Morrissey, senior trader in the Bank of Boston's New York
office, said trading was somewhat subdued, probably because
managers of corporate currency portfolios and other dealers are
taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of potentially market-moving
government statistics due later this week.
   The Commerce Department reports on March retail sales Thursday
and the Labor Department issues the Producer Price Index the
following day.
   ``It really was a fairly quiet day,'' said Morrissey. ``The
dollar was fairly well bid and closed near its highs of the day.
There were really no factors except market sentiment that pushed it
higher.''
   The dollar benefited from a weakening in the British pound on
news that the largest U.K. labor union, the Transport and General
Workers, may strike to protest the government's intention to end
the system of guaranteed work for longshoremen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6995 late Tuesday,
unchanged from Monday. But by the time trading was done for the day
in New York, the pound had lost ground and was quoted at $1.6910
compared to $1.6955 late Monday.
   Earlier, the dollar closed in Tokyo at 132.62 Japanese yen, up
from 132.53. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at
132.55 and in New York it wound up at 132.705, down from 132.90.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates, included: 1.88525 West German marks, up from 1.88325;
1.66375 Swiss francs, up from 1.66075; 6.3655 French francs, up
from 6.35675; 1,381.375 Italian lire, up from 1,379.45; and,
1.18945 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates: 1.8825 West German marks, up from 1.8785; 1.6582 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6565; 6.3535 French francs, up from 6.3425;
2.1225 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1200; 1,379.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,378.50; 1.1888 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1890.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery ended at
$385.80 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down from Monday's
settlement of $386.
   The late gold bid price in London, the major market, was $385.25
a troy ounce, up from $382.45 late Monday. The Zurich late bid
price was $385.00, up from $381.50.
   Earlier, Hong Kong gold closed at $385.35, up from $381.85.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.84 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.77.
   Silver for April delivery rose on New York's Comex, settling at
$5.834 a troy ounce, up from $5.821 on Monday.

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Up Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline futures surged in hectic trading
Tuesday, reflecting continued seasonal demand and concern that a
California refinery fire might sharply curtail production.
   Prices for unleaded gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange had jumped more than 3 cents a gallon at one
point Tuesday, before profit-taking helped push the closing price
down to a gain of just under 2 cents.
   Crude prices also rose slightly, while wholesale home heating
oil declined.
   Bob Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., attributed the uproar in the gasoline pits to news of a fire
at Chevron Oil Co.'s busy Richmond, Calif., refinery.
   He said traders speculated that gasoline and jet fuel production
there could be curtailed by up to 25 percent as a result of the
blaze.
   ``The markets are a bit distrustful of supply capabilities
lately anyway,'' said Baker.
   Oil prices, particularly gasoline, have gotten a boost in recent
weeks from the massive Exxon oil tanker spill off the coast of
Alaska. Strong seasonal demand and new summer octane regulations
that are likely to strain refinery capacity gave the market its
initial strength.
   On the New York Merc, the May contract for unleaded gasoline
jumped 1.71 cents to settle Tuesday at 69 cents a gallon. The
contract had risen 2.34 cents on Monday.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, closed 4 cents higher at $20.63 a barrel,
after gaining 57 cents on Monday.
   May wholesale heating oil, which rose 1.85 cents Monday, fell
0.22 cent to 53.23 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Corn Exports Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn exports are at their highest level since
the early 1980s but domestic use by livestock farmers is down
sharply, an Agriculture Department report showed Tuesday.
   The new supply-and-demand report said corn exports in the
current marketing year that began last Sept. 1 are expected to
total 2.1 billion bushels, up by 100 million bushels from
indications a month ago and up 21 percent from 1.73 billion shipped
in 1987-88.
   Exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments
totaled 2.4 billion bushels in 1980-81.
   About 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as
livestock feed this year, down from 4.3 billion forecast in March
and well below the record of 4.74 billion bushels consumed a year
earlier.
   According to USDA records, that would put feed use at the lowest
since 3.82 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 1983-84.
   The U.S. stockpile at the end of the beginning of the new corn
marketing year on Sept. 1 was forecast at 1.83 billion bushels, up
from the 1.66 billion bushels indicated in March.
   Last Sept. 1, before the drought-shriveled 1988 corn harvest was
added to the supply, the corn carryover was 4.23 billion bushels.
   With a reduced supply, corn prices shot up from an average of
$1.94 per bushel in 1987-88 to a projected range of $2.45 to $2.70
this season.
   The U.S. wheat carryover on June 1, the beginning of the new
wheat marketing year, was indicated at 549 million bushels, up
slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the
1.26 billion bushels in the inventory last June 1.
   Wheat exports and domestic use are down, but the main impact has
been the reduced 1988 harvest. Wheat prices are expected to average
$3.65 to $3.80 per bushel this season, up from $2.57 in 1987-88.
   The soybean situation reflects a bare-bones level of supply,
with the carryover on Sept. 1, the beginning of the 1989-90
marketing year, expected to be about 145 million bushels, compared
with 302 million last Sept. 1.
   Drought reduced last year's production, forcing prices higher.
The report forecast soybeans might average $7.20 to $7.60 per
bushel this season, compared with $5.88 in 1987-88. Exports and
domestic use are both down.

   The stock market rose in light trading Tuesday
amid ongoing uncertainty about the direction of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.71 points to
finish the day at 2,311.58.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining
ones by about 12 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 878 issues up, 515 down and 566
unchanged.
   Stocks opened higher, peaked around midday and then moved
sideways for the remainder of the session. Volume remained light,
with many institutional players staying on the sidelines to await
the slew of economic data scheduled for release later in the week.
   Retail sales for March are scheduled for release on Thursday,
followed on Friday by reports on producer prices, merchandise trade
and industrial production.
   Many financial analysts believe the economy is in for a slowdown
after several years of energetic growth.
   ``Everyone is waiting for the numbers on Friday. The market will
be wishy-washy until then,'' said Ralph J. Acampora, technical
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The jobless figure for March released last week provided mixed
signals about the economy. Although unemployment dipped one-tenth
of a percent to 5 percent, fewer than 100,000 new jobs were created.
   ``The numbers will give the market the direction it's looking
for,'' said Michael Metz, vice president of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.83 million
shares, up from 123.99 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 175.62 million shares.
   High-technology stocks helped lift the market. Prime Computer
gained 1~ to 19~; International Business Machines advanced 1\ to
111[; and Hewlett-Packard rose } to 54\.
   Exxon lost \ to 41}; Ramada dropped [ to 11|; and American
Express fell [ to 32.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $13.6 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.69 point to 167.58.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.76 to 344.24, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.38 to 298.49.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.40 to 413.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 333.14, up 1.74.

<HEAD>Swiss Judge Lifts Order Blocking RJR Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in Switzerland has lifted a temporary
restraining order that could have blocked a portion of the
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Polly Howes, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco at the food and
tobacco company's headquarters in Atlanta, on Tuesday confirmed the
decision by Swiss Judge Gorg Zogg in Basel.
   Ms. Howes said the matter was handled entirely overseas and she
could not provide further deatails.
   The judge issued the temporary restraining order March 20 in
response to a lawsuit filed by three bondholders in Switzerland who
contended that the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco last year
diminished the value of their holdings.
   The judge's order was directed at the merger as it pertained to
the assets of certain Swiss subsidiaries of RJR Nabisco. The
company argued during a hearing March 28 there was no basis for the
order, according to an RJR Nabisco proxy statement.
   A Forsyth County, N.C., judge last week also issued a temporary
restraining order blocking the KKR-RJR Nabisco merger that stemmed
from the Swiss suit.
   At the time, County District Judge James Harrill Jr. set an
April 17 hearing on a motion by Swiss investors to block the
merger. It was not immediately clear what effect the Swiss judge's
decision would have on the case in North Carolina.
   But Ms. Howes said neither case was expected to delay the
closing of the merger.
   At least three other U.S. lawsuits are pending, claiming that
the merger reduced the value of RJR Nabisco bonds.

Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate rejected President Bush's minimum
wage plan Tuesday and moved closer to confronting him with
legislation raising the hourly figure to $4.55, which he repeatedly
has promised to veto.
   The Senate, on a 61-39 vote largely along party lines, backed an
amendment to legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., that brought the measure essentially in line with a
House-passed bill that would boost the minimum wage to $4.55 by
October 1991.
   Rejected, by 58-41, was Bush's proposal to increase the minimum
wage by 30 cents a year from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 in
January 1992. It was the second time Bush's proposal was defeated
in Congress; the House rejected it three weeks ago.
   The Senate's action brought a quick response from the Bush
administration.
   ``Today Congress had a golden opportunity,'' Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole said after the vote. ``But Senate Democrats
squandered the chance, the first chance in eight years, to raise
the minimum wage.''
   More amendments were being considered before the legislation
faced a final Senate vote, likely to come Wednesday, but no further
significant changes were expected before then.
   ``We compromised,'' said Kennedy, referring to his past
proposals to raise the minimum wage even higher. He also noted a
number of other changes in the legislation, including expanded
exemptions for small businesses, to meet Republican concerns.
   ``The president's approach is a far superior approach,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in his unsuccessful effort to win support
for substituting Bush's proposal for the Kennedy bill.
   The action seemed to guarantee the first domestic-policy
showdown between Congress and Bush, barring a compromise while the
bill is before a conference committee that will work out minor
differences between the House and Senate versions.
   Such a deal, however, appears unlikely.
   ``There isn't going to be a compromise,'' said Senate Republican
leader Robert Dole of Kansas. ``It's going to be $4.25 an hour and
a six-month training wage, period.''
   Democrats nonetheless called on Bush to accept their proposal.
   ``If there is any one thing that the 101st Congress must do it
is to increase the minimum wage,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, chastising Bush for opposing a $4.55 an
hour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains tax
breaks for the wealthy. ``This legislation will be a test of
whether we indeed are seeking a kindler, gentler nation,'' said
Mitchell.
   Both the defeated Bush proposal and the amended Kennedy bill
contain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage below
the federal minimum wage.
   Bush has insisted that provision extend for six months to all
newly hired workers, regardless of prior work experience.
   Kennedy, like the sponsors of the House bill, balked at that
proposal but to win the support of moderate and conservative
Democrats agreed on a two-month period during which some employees
could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage.
   That provision was contained in the amendment, offered by
Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   ``Our training wage proposal is a proper balance of the need to
train new workers and the need to set a fair minimum wage,'' said
Graham.
   The Graham-Pryor amendment requires an employee to hold one job
for at least 30 days before the two-month training period would
expire. The House-passed bill also allows for a two-month training
period at a subminimum wage but only if the affected employee had
no prior job experience.

   Weather-damage fears and expectations of new export business
gave wheat futures prices their strongest boost in more than two
weeks Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed ahead of
an Agriculture Department supply-demand report that was issued
after the close and interpreted as bullish by market analysts.
   On other markets, gasoline futures surged while other oil
futures were mixed; livestock and meat futures retreated; and
precious metals were mixed.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 6{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.01 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to { cent
higher with May at $2.65{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 3{ cents
lower with May at $1.83\ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to
1{ cents higher with May at $7.20{ a bushel.
   The gain in wheat prices was largely a reaction to Monday's
weekly USDA crop-weather report, which showed a net decline in the
condition of the winter wheat crop for the week ending Sunday.
   The USDA said winter wheat was ``mostly fair'' but noted
deterioration of the crop in the central Great Plains and the
Pacific Northwest due to unusually dry, cold weather.
   ``The weather's a little nippy, to put it mildly, in some areas,
slowing development of wheat by about two weeks,'' said Katharina
Zimmer, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   She said other buying was prompted by perceptions that the
40-cents-a-bushel decline in wheat prices since early March was not
entirely warranted.
   Additional buying was spurred by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter's statement Monday that an agricultural trade agreement
reached over the weekend would not constrain U.S. spending to
subsidize export sales.
   Corn and soybean futures closed mixed in cautious trading ahead
of the USDA's monthly supply-and-demand report, in which the
government raised its estimates for 1988-89 corn and wheat ending
stocks but let stand its estimate for 1988-89 soybean ending stocks.
   Karlin said the increased estimates were lower than most traders
had expected and should lend support to the markets on Wednesday.
   Unleaded gasoline futures soared on the New York Mercantile
Exchange following wire-service reports that a fire at Chevron
USA's second-largest West Coast refinery could shut down the
refinery's main unit for up to two months and reduce the refinery's
output by about 25 percent.
   Gasoline prices have recently risen sharply on tight-supply
fears linked to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
   The American Petroleum Institute released its weekly
petroleum-stocks report after the close, showing a 4.7
million-barrel decline in U.S. gasoline stocks last week, which
could lead to more buying on Wednesday. The API said crude oil
stocks rose by 451,000 barrels while supplies of petroleum
distillates increased by 440,000 barrels.
   Unleaded gasoline futures settled .44 cent to 1.71 cents higher
with May at 69 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil
was 23 cents lower to 4 cents higher with May at $20.63 a barrel;
heating oil was .06 cent to .29 cent lower with May at 53.23 cents
a gallon.
   Live cattle futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in a late round of selling linked to expectations for a
sharp increase in supplies of market-ready cattle beginning next
month. Profit-taking pressured pork futures prices.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent to 1.15 cents lower with April at
77.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with April at 77.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .40 cent higher with April at 39.62 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .30 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 33.20 cents
a pound.
   Gold futures drifted lower while silver advanced slightly on New
York's Commodity Exchange in cautious trading ahead of Friday's
economic reports, which include merchandise trade data for
February, the producer price index for March, and March
capacity-utilization and industrial-production figures.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 40 cents lower with June at $389.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents higher across the board with May
at $5.863 a troy ounce.

   Prime Computer Inc. said Tuesday it will
seek a buyer willing to pay more than the $20 a share offer by
hostile suitor MAI Basic Four Inc. that values the company at $970
million.
   Prime said its financial advisors, First Boston Corp. and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., had been instructed to ``actively
solicit proposals and to pursue discussions and negotiations'' to
sell the company for more than $20 a share.
   The computer firm also said it would provide confidential
information to interested parties.
   Prime climbed to $19.87{, up $1.87{, in heavy New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday. More than 2.85 million shares changed
hands.
   MAI Basic Four Inc., a Tustin, Calif.-based computer firm
controlled by investor Bennett S. LeBow, launched its bid five
months ago for Prime, which is four times its size.
   In a statement Tuesday, LeBow said he endorsed Prime's move if
it is the company's intent to sell itself to the highest bidder.
``However, if this is another one of Prime's delaying tactics, we
intend to vigorously oppose it,'' he said, adding that he would
continue to pursue his tender offer for Prime.
   Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said estimates valuing Prime at $23
to $28 a share are more credible than MAI Basic's offer, especially
since Prime acquired Computervision Inc. in February 1988.
   He also said Prime's board of directors has not been opposed to
a sale ``if it provides the share holders with a good (price).''
   Prime Chairman David J. Dunn said in a statement that the MAI
Basic offer ``does not reflect the intrinsic value in the company
today and the long-term values achievable for all our
stockholders.''
   Prime said it was delaying its annual meeting to June 14 from
May 12 to ``provide for an orderly and effective sale process.''

   A state judge has ruled that insurance
companies don't have to pay for a $25 million dioxin cleanup at the
site of a former Diamond Shamrock plant, but must fund payments to
Agent Orange victims, insurance company attorneys said Tuesday.
   The case centers around dioxin produced as a byproduct of
herbicides, including Agent Orange, made at a Newark plant between
1951 and 1969 by the old Diamond Alkali company, a predecessor to
Shamrock. Diamond Shamrock has restructured and now is called Maxus
Energy Corp., of Dallas, Texas.
   The company sued more than 100 insurers seeking coverage for the
cleanup of the dioxin, which is linked to certain cancers, liver
disease and a severe skin rash known as chloracne.
   In a decision released to lawyers on Tuesday, Superior Court
Judge Reginald Stanton in Morristown, N.J., ruled that Diamond's
actions removed it from coverage, said Bates. Stanton heard a
non-jury trial that began in September.
   The decision could have wide-ranging effects in other cases in
which companies seek to have their insurers handle millions of
dollars in chemical and toxic waste cleanups, said Robert Bates,
who represents American Re-Insurance Co. of Princeton, N.J.
   The opinion was to be filed Wednesday morning. Insurance company
attorneys provided excerpts from it, but Diamond Shamrock lawyers
could not be reached for comment. Stanton, reached at home,
confirmed his ruling but declined to discuss it, referring
questions to the written opinion.
   ``Even by the standards of the 1951 to 1969 period, Diamond's
conduct in operating the Newark plant was unacceptably wrong and
irresponsible,'' Stanton wrote.
   ``Diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic interest
first. It deliberately and persistently cheated on the limited
environmental regulations which were in place.''
   But Stanton also found that the insurance companies have to pay
the bulk of Diamond's $23 million share of a $180 million
settlement reached in 1984 between makers of Agent Orange used in
the Vietnam War and those who sued over its health effects.
   Stanton interpreted the company's insurance contracts to mean
that the insurers would have to bear most of the Agent Orange
payments, and established how the payments would be distributed
among the carriers, according to Bates.
   Lawyers for the company could not be reached. They either had
gone home for the evening or did not return phone calls.
   A Maxus spokeswoman, Ginger Shearburn, could not be reached.
There was no answer at the company and she did not return a
telephone call left on her home answering machine.

   White House and congressional budget
negotiators, driving toward a deficit-reduction deal, said Tuesday
that major issues remain and pledged not to let any deadline ``blow
up'' the talks.
   ``When we get one issue resolved, we run into another,'' said
Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee.
   ``We have not closed on any of the major ones (issues),'' said
Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader. ``You
just have to keep plodding on, one step after another.''
   Privately, some participants said there was an eagerness to
finish so that President Bush and congressional leaders could
announce a pact at the White House this week. But no announcement
was scheduled by the time the group broke for the night Tuesday,
and Bush planned to leave Washington for the weekend early Thursday,
   But Foley said the group was not working against any deadline.
``It's silly to blow up a long negotiation over an artificial
deadline,'' he said.
   The goal of the talks is agreement on the general outlines of a
budget to bring the fiscal 1990 deficit down to $100 billion as
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The talks have dragged on far longer than expected and are now
pressing against a Saturday deadline for passing a budget
resolution.
   Bush proposed his $1.16 trillion budget in February, estimating
that about $27 billion needed to be slashed from current government
programs _ or revenues increased _ to meet the Gramm-Rudman goal.
   The negotiating team has been working on a $28 billion plan,
with about half the deficit savings coming from new revenues and
half from spending restraint.
   On the spending side, more than $7 billion in savings would be
made by restraining entitlement programs _ those requiring direct
benefit payments to individuals. More than $2.5 billion of that
would be from holding back some of the expected growth in Medicare
spending.
   They tentatively agreed last week that the revenues would
include roughly $3.4 billion from selling government assets, $5.2
billion from raising various fees for government services and $5.6
billion from unspecified taxes.
   However, the revenue mix has been changing this week as the
group has consulted the White House and the congressional
committees responsible for putting the agreement into legislation.
Less money would be raised with new fees, and more through asset
sales, sources said.
   Although the tax figure is about the same as Bush proposed in
his budget, the president's plan relied heavily on his proposal to
cut the tax rate on capital gains. Bush contends a lower capital
gains rate would actually increase government revenues by $4.8
billion next year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday denied Bush
was abandoning his support of capital gains tax reduction, but it
was subject to negotiation.
   ``He will believe in the capital gains tax cut forever and
ever,'' Fitzwater said. ``I'm not making any commitments in terms
of the budget deal. The budget deal is up to negotiation.
Everything is under discussion.''
   Actually, the details of the tax package and specific spending
decisions would be left for later.
   The negotiators have been working to produce a very broad set of
guidelines, setting forth total figures for a handful of revenue
and spending categories. It would be left for the normal
legislative process to produce the steps to enact those totals.
   Participants in the talks said they were sworn to secrecy about
the specifics, because of the sensitivity of the current
discussions on possible cuts in Bush's $300 billion defense budget
and in domestic programs.
   Bush proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with
inflation. Democratic negotiators have asked for slower defense
growth so that more domestic demands can be met.
   If the negotiators complete a package, the House and Senate
budget committees would then draft more detailed spending plans for
each chamber to consider. Then, the two chambers would need to
approve a single, compromise plan.
   The budget serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax
legislation for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   If Congress and the president don't enact legislation to reduce
the deficit to within $10 billion of the $100 billion goal, the
administration is required under the Gramm-Rudman law to order
across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

   The U.S. dollar was marginally higher against the
Japanese yen in early trading Wednesday, while stock prices also
advanced moderately in the morning market session.
   The dollar opened at 132.68 yen, up 0.06 yen from Tuesday's
close. It had closed at 132.69 yen in New York overnight.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said market participants were
reluctant to take large positions on the dollar before Friday, when
the United States will announce major economic indicators,
including the nation's trade figures for February.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders said growing investor
confidence pushed the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 250.56-point winner Tuesday, up 153.87 points or
0.46 percent to 33,403.45 shortly after the market opened.

<HEAD>Northrop Named in Indictment on Cruise Missile Guidance System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. and five current and former
employees were indicted Tuesday on charges they conspired to
defraud the government in building components for the guidance
system for the cruise missile and the Harrier jet fighter.
   The 167-count indictment announced by U.S. Attorney Robert
Bonner charged that Northrop and the five conspired to install
install parts of the cruise missile system which failed to meet
government specifications.
   The indictment also alleged that lengthy reliability testing on
the cruise missile's Flight Data Transmitter was not performed as
required and that three of the defendants supervised false testing
and falsification of test results.
   If convicted on all charges, Northrop faces a maximum fine of
more than $30 million. Each of the individual defendants would face
maximum jail sentences of five years on each count and fines
ranging from $5,000 to $250,000.
   ``Today's indictment is part of our continuing efforts to
identify, prosecute and hopefully deter defense procurement
fraud,'' Bonner said in a statement.
   He said the indictment was the result of a two-year probe by a
multiagency task force.
   There was no immediate reaction to the indictment from Northrop.
   ``Obviously we haven't seen it, so we can't comment,'' said Greg
Waskul, a spokesman at the Century City office.
   Named in the indictment were Joseph Yamron, a resident of
Massachusetts and vice president and general manager of the
Precision Products Divsion of Northrop. Also named were Leopold
Engler of Massachusetts, formerly a vice president with Northrop;
Charles Gonsalves, of Glendora, Calif., former manager of the
Western Services department of Northrop; Cheryl Hannan, of
Glendora, formerly quality assurance supervisor for Western
Services and Howard Hyde of Yorba Linda, Calif., former chief
engineer for Western Services.
   With regard to the Harrier jet project, the indictment accused
Northrop, Gonzalves, Hyde and Ms. Hannan of conspiring to defraud
the government about the stabilization systems sold by Northrop to
be installed in the Navy jet.
   The indictment accused the defendants of failing to conduct
vibration tests at levels required by the contract on sensor
assemblies used in the jet, and then falsely certifying they had
been properly tested.
   The Harrier can take off from short fields and can hover, and
sophisticated stability controls are critical to its performance
and safety.
   On the cruise missile project, the indictment charges that
Northrop, Yamron and Engler knew that the Flight Data Transmitter
was required to withstand temperatures as low as -65 degrees, but
supplied parts that froze at temperatures of -40 to -50 degrees.
   Many of the cruise missile's presumed targets are deep within
the Soviet Union, where temperatures can drop to extreme levels.
Should the Flight Data Transmitter fail in extreme cold, the weapon
could not reach its target.
   Northrop produced and shipped approximately 1,175 Flight Data
Transmitters between 1981 and 1989 for use in the missile, which
have been deployed on B-52 and B-1B bombers.
   The company produced and shipped 189 sensor assemblies for the
Harrier jet between 1982 and 1989.
   Bonner said the Air Force and Navy are now evaluating the
evidence on the alleged falsifications in order to determine if
action must be taken to ensure the reliability of the missiles and
the Harrier.
   Northrop also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former
employees who alleged the company falsified test results and
cheated the Air Force on the MX missile project.
   In addition to well-publicized battles with critics of the MX
program, the company faces a congressional investigation of
allegations of improper payments to South Korean businessmen in an
unsuccessful effort to sell its F-20 Tigershark fighter in that
country in 1984.
   Northrop is also the main contractor for the B-2 stealth bomber.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rough seas that helped stall and break up
some of giant oil spill from the Exxon Valdez became calmer Tuesday
and winds shifted away from fish-rich Kodiak Island, the Coast
Guard said.
   ``Kodiak still seems to be saved,'' said Jim Hayden, the state
of Alaska's cleanup coordinator.
   Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said the spill appears to have
stalled and is breaking into tar balls. ``That's better than ooey,
gooey oil,'' he said.
   Equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military
transports. About 67 tons of material, everything from containment
booms to absorbent pads, were scheduled to arrive Tuesday.
   A huge Soviet oil-skimming vessel, the Vay Dagursky, was
expected to arrive Saturday, state officials said. The ship can
skim 200,000 gallons an hour and store 2 million gallons of oil on
board, according to the officials. But it remains unclear how
effective it might be against the Alaska spill.
   Despite the favorable weather, a light sheen of oil seeped into
the Kenai Fjords National Park at scattered inlets and fjords,
Freeze said. With a thickness measured in molecules, the sheen does
not threaten serious environmental damage, he said.
   The operator of the trans-Alaska pipeline said it had complied
with a state order for an around-the-clock, 12-person oil spill
emergency response crew, and had purchased a supply of oil
dispersant.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. has been criticized for disbanding
the emergency response team years before the spill, and for not
having enough dispersant on hand to combat the 10.1 million gallons
of crude that spilled.
   The Coast Guard said it planned to deploy a flotilla of 30
fishing boats from Seward and six from Kodiak, along with the Coast
Guard cutter Morganthau, to drag small-holed herring and shrimp
nets through the leading edge of the slick.
   Coast Guard Capt. Joe Blackett said tests Monday showed the nets
break the oil into small globs, which don't reform. The operation
may not begin until Wednesday, Blackett said.
   Much of the cleanup operation so far has relied on floating
containment booms. Cleanup crews ran into trouble when they tried
to deploy a more permanent boom at Sawmill Bill, site of a salmon
hatchery. Anchors weren't available in adequate numbers, Freeze
said, and depth charts that hadn't been updated since the 1964
earthquake proved inaccurate.
   The Coast Guard has been in charge of cleanup operations since
President Bush ordered stepped up federal involvement last week.
   Monday's rough weather, which saw seas to 15 feet, gale-force
wind warnings and small craft advisories, turned calmer Tuesday.
Aerial spotter flights resumed, seas reduced to 5 to 7 feet _ still
above normal _ and winds shifted from the northwest. That could
steer oil to the southeast and away from the coastline and Kodiak,
the nation's richest fishing port last year.
   Oil hasn't traveled further southwest than Gore Point, about 80
miles northeast of Kodiak, in four days.
   ``The weather did get very rough out there,'' said Hal
Alabaster, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. ``Under certain conditions these weather factors
could be very beneficial.''
   Officials hoped for a more accurate assessment of the sea's work
when aerial surveys are completed.
   The spill has killed thousands of birds and animals, and
gasoline prices in the United States have surged in the wake of the
disaster.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner warned oil
companies against using the spill as an excuse to increase prices.
   ``If they're doing it, they're making a big mistake,'' he told
reporters in Cincinnati. ``I hope the oil industry isn't foolish
enough _ and I don't think they are, I haven't seen any proof of it
_ to think they can take advantage of the situation at Valdez to
raise prices unnecessarily.''
   In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo ordered state officials to
investigate the rising oil prices.
   ``It would be patently unfair if the oil industry took advantage
of a tragedy of its own making in Alaska as an excuse to increase
retail gasoline prices,'' said Cuomo. ``That would be the
equivalent of picking the pockets of ... consumers.''
   At the Kodiak Cafe, fishermen anxiously awaited their fate. Even
if the spill turns back this time, Kodiak may not be in the clear
for months until most of the slick is out in the gulf.
   ``Yeah, I worry about the long-term effects. We all do. I wonder
what will happen,'' said Earl Peterson, who harvests crab, salmon
and halibut on his 52-foot boat.
   About 18,000 barrels of crude have been recovered _ only 8
percent of the 240,000 barrels that spilled March 24 when the
tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef.
   Exxon said with additional skimmers about 2,000 barrels were
being recovered daily. Reports from state officials and the Coast
Guard have placed the figure at about 1,000 barrels a day.

   Eastern Airlines' striking unions reached 5-year
agreements Monday with Peter V. Ueberroth that apparently resulted
in changes to Ueberroth's agreement to buy the airline from parent
Texas Air Corp., sources said.
   After four days of almost continuous bargaining, Ueberroth's
group and the three striking unions, representing the Machinists,
pilots and flight attendants, struck their deals at about 6 a.m.
Monday in Washington.
   The parties then flew to New York and went directly to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for a series of meetings that lasted eight hours.
Present for some of the meetings was former Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, although his role was not clear.
   At 7 p.m., Ueberroth emerged from the courthouse and announced
the union settlement, calling it ``a historic labor partnership.''
   Sources said Ueberroth and the unions apparently made changes to
the $464 million deal under which the former baseball commissioner
would buy Eastern. Unless Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo agrees
to the changes, the unions' agreements with Ueberroth cannot go
forward.
   A key change demanded by the unions is that the bankruptcy court
appoint a special trustee to take over the operation of Eastern
from Lorenzo as the airline attempts to emerge from Chapter 11, the
New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.
   ``We have not yet seen a copy of the agreement. We understand it
is very complex and we will study it,'' Texas Air spokesman Art
Kent said late Monday from Houston.
   ``We have one more major bridge to cross,'' Ueberroth told
reporters, reading a statement he had just scrawled in the
courthouse lobby. ``And that's right here in this courthouse. That
bridge must be crossed. ... There's no guarantee we will cross it.''
   Ueberroth said talks would continue Tuesday in an effort to get
Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, back in the air.
Eastern has been largely grounded since Machinists struck March 4
and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support.
   Texas Air, which purchased Eastern in 1986, was maintaining that
nothing had been accomplished.
   ``There's no agreement as far as we're concerned,'' said Bruce
Zirinsky, an Eastern lawyer.
   ``There was no meeting of the minds,'' said Harvey Miller,
another Eastern lawyer.
   Ueberroth declined to give details of his deals with the unions.
Union sources said the concessions totalled about $210 million.
   The unions have been wary that proposed tranfers of assets
totalling $79 million from Eastern to Texas Air could affect
Eastern's viability. The unions, since before the strike, have been
oppoosed to transferring aircraft, routes, airport gates, among
other thing.
   All agreements must be approved by parties to Eastern's
bankruptcy proceeding, which include Texas Air and Eastern's
creditors. Eastern filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws
on March 9.
   Lawyers for the creditors were present for the whirlwind series
of meetings at the courthouse. Among the union participants were
Charles Bryan, head of Eastern's Machinists union; Jack Bavis, head
of Eastern's pilots union; and Mary Jane Barry, head of Eastern's
flight attendants union.
   Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is presiding over the bankruptcy,
was nearby and even made popcorn for the negotiators. Carlucci, a
vice chairman of a Washington investment company, was in and out of
the talks. He declined to identify his role.
   By the end of the day, the negotiators had reached the point of
exhaustion. Ueberroth, who flew to California on Friday, returned
to Washington on Saturday and said he had not slept since.
Representatives of the unions and examiner David Shapiro had been
going non-stop with Ueberroth's people since Thursday night.
   Several times, they needed to break away. Ueberroth took
representatives of the three striking unions to lunch. At another
point, Ueberroth broke away with partner J. Thomas Talbot and and
went to a restaurant where they talked and watched a college
baseball game on television.
   By dusk, the parties said they were too tired to go on and
Ueberroth asked the court's permission to announce the deals with
the three unions. He said the agreements also would cover 11,000
non-union employees at Eastern, such as reservation clerks, ticket
agents, and clerical workers.
   A representative of non-union employees, Mary Grace Shore, said
her group objected to not being represented in the talks. Ms. Shore
sits on the Eastern unsecured creditors committee.
   Ueberroth has said Eastern could begin expanding its schedule 24
hours after final agreements are reahced between his group, Texas
Air and the unions.
   Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman in Miami, said Monday it
could take 10 days for the airline to resume 80 percent of its
prestrike schedule of 1,040 daily flights once the unions agreed to
return.
   The delay would stem from needed maintenance and inspection of
idled planes, ferrying of aircraft to appropriate airports,
recalling laid-off employees and other logistical tasks.
   Using non-union employees and non-striking 200 pilots, Eastern
is flying about 110 flights daily, focusing on its Northeast
shuttle and Latin American routes. The airline has a deal to sell
the shuttle to New York developer Donald J. Trump for $365 million.
   Raymond Wright, a vice chairman of the master executive council
of the Air Line Pilots Association, estimated it could take 45-60
days for Eastern to resume a full schedule once striking employees
return.
   Union officials also said it would be foolish and costly to
restore a full schedule immediately because Eastern, already
carrying a heavy debt, would have few passengers in the days
immediately following resumption of service.
   Separately, a federal appeals court upheld injunctions barring
New York metropolitan-area passenger rail workers from striking in
sympathy with Eastern employees.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court
ruling that the federal Railway Labor Act barred unionized workers
at the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad, New
Jersey Transit and Amtrak from honoring the picket lines of
striking Eastern machinists.
   Sympathy strikes at the railroads would have affected about
400,000 commuters.
