<HEAD>Deng Calls on Military to Support Jiang</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping called on the
military Sunday to give its full support to Communist Party chief
Jiang Zemin, who replaced Deng as head of the party's Central
Military Commission.
   Deng, in a speech to senior military officers, said Jiang ``is
the qualified chairman of the military commission because he is the
qualified general secretary of the party,'' the official Xinhua
News Agency reported.
   It quoted Deng as saying Jiang was the nucleus of the party and
his appointment was a ``correct choice made by the whole party.''
   Jiang, a former Shanghai party boss who was named head of the
Communist Party in June, has no military connections and the
decision to name him chairman of the military commission may have
met resistance within the military hierarchy.
   Deng, 85, on Thursday announced his resignation from the
commission, the last official party post he held.
   He is certain to remain China's most powerful political figure
while he is in good health, but has stepped down from his official
positions to help pave the way for a transition to Jiang, his
chosen successor.
   Foreign diplomats say Jiang, with a weak power base in Beijing,
would have a difficult time surviving a power st Requested port out

   It looked like Win No. 2 for the expansion
Minnesota Timberwolves and a third straight loss for the road-weary
Seattle SuperSonics.
   Minnesota used a 16-2 spurt to take an 83-80 lead and had the
ball with nine minutes to go. But Sam Mitchell, who keyed the
Timberwolves' run, was called for traveling.
   Dale Ellis followed with a 3-point jumper that practically
deflated the Metrodome roof. The 21,702 fans let out a collective
groan, Seattle's Derrick McKey took over under the basket and the
Sonics used a 19-4 surge to win 108-97.
   ``We needed a basket desperately'' said Ellis, who has made more
3-pointers (486) than any other player in NBA history. ``We had
been down the court a few times and had come up empty-handed. I
like to take shots in times like that. I feel 3-pointers are
high-percentage shots.
   ``Three-pointers are like dunks. They can deflate an opponent.
They'll give up for a short spell and that's all it takes.''
   It's all it took for McKey to take over. He scored 10 of his 32
points during the decisive rally.
   ``He broke our backs,'' Wolves coach Bill Musselman said. ``We
tried everybody on him. It was tough to match up with him.''
   Said Minnesota's Tony Campbell: ``We went ahead, then this guy
started making everything. He shot from his ankles and it went in.''
   Seattle led 78-67 with 2:33 left in the third quarter, but
Mitchell scored eight of his career-high 31 points and Campbell
added six of his 30 during the run that gave the Timberwolves their
three-point lead.
   Ellis' 3-pointer was the first scoring of the fourth quarter for
the Sonics, who had committed turnovers their first five times down
the court.
   McKey followed with a 10-footer, Michael Cage dunked and Xavier
McDaniel made a short jumper before McKey scored eight straight
points to complete the spurt for a 99-87 lead.
   Seattle coach Bernie Bickerstaff said it was just a matter of
getting his starters back in the game. He felt it was necessary to
give them some rest after Thursday's five-overtime loss at
Milwaukee and Saturday's 109-102 defeat at Chicago.
   ``That was the only difference I could see,'' he said. ``When
players are fatigued, they revert to sloppy, playground basketball.
The team could have made excuses, but they responded. They executed
excellently down the stretch. Ellis hit his 3-pointer and we
exploited Derrick inside.''
   McDaniel added 26 points for the Sonics, whose three victories
this season include two over Minnesota.
   Before the loss at Chicago dropped its record to 2-3, Seattle
hadn't been under .500 since Nov. 30, 1988.
   For Minnesota, the defeat came two days after it beat
Philadelphia for its first-ever victory.
   Cage had 12 of his 18 points and 10 of his 16 rebounds in the
first half as the Sonics took a 58-49 halftime lead.

   A pilot who had trouble starting her
plane Saturday got out, cranked the propeller by hand and watched
helplessly as the plane and its lone passenger taxied out of
control and ran into a wall.
   ``I guess it wasn't starting and she was trying to prop start
it,'' Ocean City patrolman T. Neiman said. ``I guess that worked.''
   The passenger was taken to Shore Memorial Hospital in nearby
Somers Point and treated for a minor ankle injury, Neiman said. No
one else was injured, he said. He would not release the women's
names.
   The aircraft, a single-engine Cessna 15-M, taxied across the
tarmac at Ocean City Municipal Airport and hit the wall of an
adjacent condominium complex before coming to a stop, he said.
   Neiman said the Federal Aviation Administration and police in
the seaside town 60 miles south of New York City were investigating
the mishap.

<HEAD>Paper: Man Held in Shooting of Pregnant Woman and Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sought in last month's shooting of a
pregnant woman and her husband has been arrested for a traffic
violation, it was reported Sunday.
   Police in the nearby community of Burlington, where the arrest
was made Saturday, refused to confirm a report in the Boston Sunday
Herald that William Bennett was wanted in the shooting.
   The attack, which prompted widespread news reports examining
Boston's crime problems, killed attorney Carol Stuart her baby, who
was delivered by Caesarean section. Her husband, Charles Stuart,
remains hospitalized.
   Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, was arrested at
the Burlington home of his girlfriend, said Burlington police Lt.
Arnold Christiansen. He said the arrest, for a traffic violation,
was made at the request of the Boston police and referred further
questions to that department. ``It was a routine arrest on a
traffic warrant,'' said Christiansen.
   Boston police refused to comment on the reports, and they
refused to confirm or deny they had Bennett in custody on any
charge, said Sgt. Al Dennehey said Saturday night.
   ``If he is in custody, we have not yet been notified,'' Dennehey
said Saturday night. ``To my knowledge, no one has been arrested
for that shooting.''
   The Herald quoted unnamed police sources as saying Bennett was a
suspect in the double shooting.
   The defendant's mother, Pauline Bennett, told the paper her son
was wanted in the attack.
   ``They say he's a suspect. He's been in trouble before. He knew
he was a suspect. He was nervous and upset about it,'' Pauline
Bennett said.
   Mrs. Stuart died after she was shot by a man who abducted the
couple as they left the inner-city Brigham and Women's Hospital,
where they had attended a birthing class. Charles Stuart was listed
in guarded condition after having surgery Saturday at Boston City
Hospital.
   The infant, Christopher Stuart, was delivered by Caesarean
section and clung to life for more than two weeks before succumbing
to a respiratory ailment Thursday. The medical examiner ruled his
death a homicide.
   Bennett has served separate prison terms for shooting two police
officers, the newspaper reported.
   Charles Stuart told police his assailant shot him because he
thought Stuart was a police officer.

<HEAD>Businessman Wants To Buy Berlin Wall for Souvenirs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't bulldoze the Berlin Wall just yet, says
a California businessman who wants to buy it and sell chunks for
souvenirs.
   Barry Stuppler, a precious metals and coins dealer, said
Saturday he tried to offer the East German government $50 million
for the wall after watching TV reports of Berliners ripping out
chunks as keepsakes of the day the communist government ended
travel restrictions.
   ``To be candid with you, I think I could merchandise it,'' said
Stuppler, president of Gold and Silver Financial Group.
   Stuppler said he hopes to put together an investment partnership
of about 50 people to quickly raise funds to buy salvage rights.
   ``They (the East Germans) need hard currency and I have an
interest in spending the money and doing it,'' he said. ``What else
are they going to do with it (the wall) anyway?''
   Stuppler said he had called the East German embassy in
Washington, D.C., and was told someone would get back to him next
week.
   An embassy employee who refused to give his name said he hadn't
heard of Stuppler's bid, but added that the people who would handle
such a proposal were out of the office for the weekend.
   Stuppler acknowledged he's unlikely to get title to the wall,
which is already being picked at by souvenir hunters after looming
for 28 years as a grim symbol of the division of East and West
Berlin.
   If he were to succeed, he would cut the wall into small chunks
for sale, with each keepsake piece certified as authentic by the
East German government.
   ``I think direct sale of it would probably be very easy,'' he
said. ``I think this is a piece of history well worth saving for
posterity.''

   A pilot has spotted the wreckage
of an air force helicopter that crashed in northern jungle late
last week, and all 21 people aboard were believed dead, the
national news agency said Sunday.
   The helicopter and its three-member crew were ferrying 15 police
officers, one of their wives and two children when the craft was
reported missing Thursday.
   It was flying about 140 miles north of Kuala Lumpur at the time.
   An air force pilot in another helicopter located the wreckage in
jungle Sunday morning and reported no sign of survivors, the
Bernama news agency said, quoting air force Brig. Gen. Huang Chew
Siong.
   More rescue teams have left for the crash site to recover the
bodies, he was quoted as saying. All aboard the missing helicopter
were Malaysians.
   No cause of the crash was given.

   An Amtrak passenger train rammed a van

authorities said.
   Nobody aboard the train was injured and the engine wasn't
damaged in the crash in this suburb north of Minneapolis, said
Bruce Heard, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington, D.C.
   The railroad crossing arms were down and warning lights were
flashing when the crash occurred at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, said a
dispatcher at the Anoka County Sheriff's Department.
   The department identified the victims as Kenneth John Hansen,
24, of Minneapolis; Paul Kenneth Mills, 24, of Coon Rapids; and
Scott Robert Tellefsen, 23, of Coon Rapids.
   The two injured men, Thomas Carl Ramberg, 22, and Patrick
Michael O'Donnell, 24, both of Coon Rapids, were listed in stable
condition at Mercy Medical Center, according to nursing supervisor
Teresa Daigle.
   The train, known as the Empire Builder, was delayed about 48
minutes before continuing to Seattle, Heard said.

   A U.S. Navy destroyer collided with a merchant
ship off Malaysia Sunday, killing one American sailor and injuring
four shipmates, a Navy spokesman said.
   It was the sixth accident involving a Navy ship in the last two
weeks. Seven personnel have been killed or lost at sea and 16
injured in the string of accidents.
   Several fires broke out aboard the destroyer USS Kinkaid and the
Singapore vessel Kota Petani when they collided at 5:19 a.m. Sunday
local time in the Malacca Strait, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a
spokesman for the Pacific Fleet in Honolulu.
   The fires aboard the San Diego-based destroyer were quickly
contained, and the crew of the Kinkaid and the frigate USS Rentz
helped douse the flames aboard the Kota Petani, Anderson said.
   No injuries were reported aboard the merchant vessel, which
sustained major damage to its bow, he said.
   The crash took place about 240 miles northwest of Singapore in
the strait that runs between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian
island of Sumatra, connecting the South China Sea and the Andaman
Sea.
   The names of the dead and injured were being withheld until
their relatives could be notified, Anderson said.
   The cause of the collision was under investigation, Anderson
said.
   The destroyer carries 20 officers and 297 enlisted personnel,
Navy spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Camille Estrada said in Washington.
   The accident was the latest in a series aboard Navy vessels
during the past two weeks. The others:
   _On Oct. 29, when a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft
carrier USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and
four sailors on the ship.
   _On Nov. 1, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and four of
those were treated for burns following an early morning fire in a
boiler aboard the USS Monongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar.
   _ On Oct. 31, three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of
non-nuclear missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier
USS Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. One sailor was missing and
presumed dead.
   _ On Oct. 30, a sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson fell into the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island
and was presumed lost. _ Also on Oct. 30, a F@A-18 pilot dropped a
500-pound bomb on the guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the
Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a
five-foot hole in the ship's bow.
   Before Sunday's accident, the Navy had said there had been 101
``operation and training related'' fatalities throughout the
service since the beginning of the year. That figure included 47
deaths in an explosion on board the USS Iowa on April 19.

   Leftist guerrillas launched a
series of attacks in the capital Saturday, leaving three people
dead and at least 26 injured, officials and witnesses said. Rebels
said they targeted President Alfredo Cristiani's official residence.
   Gunfire, explosions and sirens could be heard throughout the
city Saturday night.
   ``There are many people wounded by bullets and explosives but we
have not gathered complete information because we have not been
able to evacuate the wounded, the combat is so intense,'' a Red
Cross spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Three Red Cross ambulances were either shot at or hit in the
crossfire, a spokesman for the group said. Two rescuers were
injured when bullets hit the tires of one ambulance and it
overturned, he said.
   An Associated Press photographer said he saw about 30 people
wounded at the government's Rosales Hospital.
   An employee of the armed forces press office, speaking by
telephone on condition of anonymity, reported ``attacks
everywhere'' but could not confirm their exact locations.
   Residents said they heard rifle fire near the homes of Cristiani
and Ricardo Alvarenga, president of the legislative assembly, and
the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos claimed attacks on both
houses. The official presidential residence was also attacked, it
said.
   It was not immediately known whether the leaders were injured in
the attacks. But according to civilian sources, the attack on
Alvarenga's residence left at least one guerrilla dead and at two
security guards wounded.
   The attacks came three days after the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front promised to intensify its decade-old insurgency
against the U.S.-backed government, in which more than 70,000
people have been killed.
   Radio stations said rebels attacked installations of the armed
forces joint chiefs of staff and military positions in the city of
Santa Tecla, west of the capital. Also reported hit were army or
security force installations in the San Salvador neighborhoods of
Mejicanos, Zacamil, Soyapango, Miramonte, Miralvalle, Montebello,
the National University and the Catholic University.
   Some radio reports said four civilians were wounded in
Mejicanos. They also said attacks were launched on the eastern
cities of San Miguel and Usulutaan, but military officials could
not confirm it.
   The first guerrilla attack came Saturday morning when guerrillas
launched six homemade mortars at the barracks in northern San
Salvador, said Col. Carlos Carrillo, director of the National
Guard. He said one struck the installation, injuring three soldiers.
   Another mortar landed in a poor neighborhood, killing two
children and injuring five civilians, Carrillo said.
   He said the mortars had been placed in three vehicles at the
barracks' perimeter but technicians deactivated one before it
exploded.
   ``The attack was a demonstration of their (the rebels')
inefficiency. If they had planned it well, all of their shots would
have fallen inside the installations,'' Carrillo said.
   However, witnesses said one explosive hit a truck in the
barracks and injured 10 soldiers.
   Carrillo said the rebel front was probably behind the attack.
The rebels did not claim responsibility.
   Guerrilla leaders said last week that they planned to intensify
their attacks in El Salvador. The guerrillas attacked another
military barracks Oct. 30, killing one person and injuring 15
people.
   Rebel leader claim that Cristiani is not interested in
negotiating a solution to the conflict. They also blame his
rightist government for the Oct. 31 bombing of a union headquarters
in San Salvador that killed 10 people and injured more than 30.
   Recent peace talks between the government and the guerrilla
front have not moved any closer to ending the war.

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino wound up
a tour of the United States and Canada by attending a Roman
Catholic mass Saturday that drew rival demonstrators backing Mrs.
Aquino and cause of the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino thanked 800 celebrants at the evening mass in St.
Basil's Cathedral, and used the brief address to repeat the message
of her visit: That Americans can bolster her nation's struggling
economy and help the country's poor by buying Philippine products.
   She was scheduled to depart for the Philippines after the mass,
ending a week-long trip that included meetings with President Bush
and Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   ``I must say I am overwhelmed by the continued warmth for myself
and my organization,'' Mrs. Aquino told churchgoers, speaking in
English and in Tagalog, one of the languages of the Philippines.
   ``Your buying of Filipino products will help our poor and
unemployed,'' she said after a service celebrated by Los Angeles
Archbishop Roger Mahony and 20 Filipino-American priests.
   Outside the cathedral in the Westwood district, police officers
in riot gear separated rival groups of demonstrators, one backing
Mrs. Aquino and the other, composed of supporters of Marcos family,
criticizing her rule.
   Some demanded she allow the Marcos family to return Marcos's
body to the Philippines for burial. He died in September in Hawaii.
   The crowd of about 1,000 appeared evenly divided between
supporters of Mrs. Aquino and Marcos. Despite frequent shouting
matches, no serious violence or arrests were reported, said Officer
Thomas Wunsch.
   An estimated 650,000 Filipino-Americans live in the Los Angeles
area.
   During her visit, Mrs. Aquino signed agreements with the
Canadian government for $104 million in aid for her country's
beleaguered economy. She also arranged rescheduling of $6.6 million
of Philippine foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   The mayors of East and West Berlin shook hands
Sunday at a new Berlin Wall crossing point in a historic meeting
symbolizing the crumbling of the Cold War relic that divided the
city since 1961.
   Their meeting came after more than 1 million East Germans poured
into West Germany on Saturday, taking advantage of their
government's opening of Western borders. The vast majority intended
to make a brief visit and then return to the East.
   On Sunday, West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper and his East Berlin
counterpart, Erhard Krack, met at the Potsdamer Platz, a bleak,
virtual no-man's land bisected by the Berlin Wall.
   Hours before their morning session, East German workers drilled
a hole through the wall with jackhammers at Potsdamer Platz,
creating the third new border crossing point since East Germany's
Communist leaders announced the end of travel restrictions late
last week.
   Momper and Krack later left the area for breakfast and talks in
a West Berlin hotel.
   The new freedom to travel and other reforms in East Germany have
touched off a wave of enthusiam about the possibility of reuniting
the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
   However, East German Communist leader Egon Krenz on Saturday
dismissed such talk.
   The new wave of visitors to West Berlin and West Germany on
Sunday was expected to exceed Saturday's estimated 1.3 million
visitors, almost 8 percent of East German's 16.6 million population.
   Most of Saturday's exuberant visitors returned home overnight,
West German border police said.
   A core of East German and West Berlin revelers kept a joyful
vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the western side of the
Berlin Wall.
   However, West Berlin riot police vans lined up in front of the
wall at the Brandenburg Gate early Sunday to try to fend off
revelers who lit torches and candles in memory of East Germans
killed trying to escape over the wall.
   At the Friederichstrasse crossing point, known as Checkpoint
Charlie, renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich gave an impromptu
concert Saturday in front of a section of the wall covered with
graffiti.
   Police said a 24-year-old visitor from Potsdam, East Germany,
went into labor on bustling Wuerttembergische Strasse and gave
birth to a girl on the sidewalk, to the delight of a surrounding
crowd.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said he would meet with
Krenz, whose three weeks in office have brought a whirlwind of
change, to discuss ways of cooperating in the new age.
   However, Krenz told Kohl to forget any ideas of making the two
nations that rose from the rubble of World War II into a single
Germany again.
   East Germany's Communist authorities built the 14-foot-high
Berlin Wall beginning Aug. 13, 1961, to stem a flow of workers to
the West. Ironically, it was another flight this year, of more than
200,000 East Germans, that forced them to open it.
   East German leaders lifted travel regulations and pledged
greater democratic freedoms after both the exodus and weeks of
street protests.

broke down. At least three people were reported dead and 40 wounded.
   Leftist rebels Saturday night attacked the residence of
right-wing President Alfredo Cristiani and other official buildings
and occupied several sectors of the northern part of San Salvador,
where fighting continued Sunday. He was reportedly not in danger.
   Casualty reports were incomplete, since ambulances were unable
to drive in some affected areas.
   Civilian sources contacted by telephone reported fighting in
four of 14 provinces, but there were no immediate official reports
of casualties.
   An airline employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said
international flights were suspended because two explosive devices
were found at the airport and the access road to the airport was
damaged due to guerrilla attacks.
   Military headquarters in the eastern cities of San Miguel and
Usulutan were attacked, said Col. Rene Ponce, chief of the joint
chiefs of staff.
   Ponce, speaking on the government's National Radio, said no one
was killed or wounded in the military installations.
   However, at least one guerrilla and two children were reported
killed in the fighting, which began early Saturday. The
government's Rosales Hospital said 40 civilians were admitted with
injuries.
   ``There are many people wounded by bullets and explosives, but
we have not gathered complete information because we have not been
able to evacuate the wounded, the combat is so intense,'' a Red
Cross spokesman said Saturday.
   Ponce said the most significant attacks were launched on the
private and official residences Cristiani; the home of the
president of the legislative assembly, Ricardo Alvarenga; the 1st
Infantry Brigade; the national police headquarters in the Mejicanos
neighborhood; the 3rd Infantry Brigade in San Miguel; and the 6th
Brigade in Usulutan.
   The San Salvador neighborhood where most of the country's top
military officers live also came under fire, he said.
   Ponce said Cristiani ``is under complete protection and at no
time was he in danger.''
   Alvarenga also escaped injury. However, the attack on his
residence left at least one guerrilla dead and at two security
guards wounded, according to civilian sources.
   The first guerrilla attack came Saturday morning when guerrillas
launched shells from homemade mortars at a barracks in northern San
Salvador, said Col. Carlos Carrillo, director of the National
Guard. He said one struck the installation, injuring three soldiers.
   Another mortar landed in a poor neighborhood, killing two
children and injuring five civilians, Carrillo said.
   Gunfire, explosions and sirens rang out throughout the city
Saturday night and into the early morning hours Sunday.
   Among the wounded was the 15-year-old daughter of Egyptian
ambassador Mahr Elkachess. He told The Associated Press by
telephone from a hospital that his daughter, Nadine, was undergoing
surgery and her condition was unknown.
   Ponce called the attacks ``irritations that only affected the
civilian population.'' He said the armed forces have ``responded
efficiently, rejecting the terrorist aggression.''
   The attacks came three days after the rebels' Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front promised to intensify its decade-old
insurgency against the U.S.-backed government. More than 70,000
people have been killed.
   Recent peace talks between the government and the guerrilla
front broke down.

   Colleges run by Indian tribes have inadequate
salaries and libraries and often operate out of trailers because of
eroding federal support, according to new study released Sunday.
   U.S. support for the 24 colleges serving some 4,400 Indian
students has been ``woefully insufficient,'' concluded ``Tribal
Colleges: Shaping the Future of Native Americans,'' by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   Their accomplishments have occurred ``despite the federal
government's benign neglect and a lack of national awareness of
their merits,'' said the 103-page report.
   The first and largest, Navajo Community College in Tsaile,
Ariz., was founded in 1968 and has more than 1,000 students.
   Twenty-three others have opened in Montana, Arizona, North
Dakota, South Dakota, California, Oregon, Nebraska, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Illinois. Most are two-year colleges.
   Approximately 90,000 Indians attend U.S. colleges, according to
federal statistics, and nearly all attend non-Indian institutions.
Many such schools have become more hospitable to Indians and at
least 85 have established Indian studies programs, according to the
Carnegie study.
   Nonetheless, mainstream colleges have a poor record with such
students. Almost 90 percent drop out, the report said.
   Unlike past programs that frequently encouraged Indians to deny
their heritage, a central mission of tribal colleges has been to
help tribes ``reclaim their cultural heritage,'' wrote foundation
president Ernest L. Boyer in a foreword to the study.
   Eleven years ago, Congress authorized the government to provide
$4,000 for each full-time student at tribal colleges, and a lesser
amount for part-time students. The authorized grant per student was
later increased to $5,825, but actual appropriations never
approached those figures, the report by the Princeton, N.J.-based
foundation said.
   In 1980, when there were only about 1,700 students in tribal
colleges, the federal government distributed $5 million under the
Tribally Controlled Community College Act, about $3,000 per
student, the report said.
   By 1989, with enrollments up nearly threefold, ``the
appropriation climbed to $8.5 million, but the amount generated for
each student declined to $1,900. In effect, tribal colleges are
being penalized for their own success,'' said the report.
   Federal funding up to authorized levels headed the list of 10
recommendations in the report, which also called for increased
support from states and private foundations.
   Many tribal colleges ``are forced to carry on their work in
trailers and abandoned government buildings that other colleges
would have hauled away or bulldozed over 20 years ago,'' it said.
   ``Such poor facilities not only restrict learning, but also make
a powerful statement of neglect,'' said the study.
   The report, the first to examine the work of tribal colleges,
was written by Paul Boyer, a journalism instructor at California
State University at Sacramento, and comes at a time of heightened
attention to the plight of Indian education.
   Two foundations, the MacArthur Foundation and U.S. West, were
scheduled to announce multimillion-dollar grants to aid tribal
colleges and other Indian institutions at a news conference in
Washington on Monday.
   Last month, U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos announced
plans for an in-depth study of Indian education. The joint study by
the Education and Interior Departments will review the
effectiveness of government programs affecting Indian education, he
said.
   Tribally controlled colleges were spawned in the midst of the
1960s civil rights era, when Indians and other minority groups were
actively rejecting assimilationist arguments and demanding a voice
in running institutions affecting them.
   Since their beginnings, many tribal colleges have offered
tutoring in basic skills and extensive counseling. At some, faculty
and administrators visit the homes of students who start missing
classes.
   Tribal colleges offer social and economic services to entire
Indian communities. Many offer adult education or work with local
businesses to enhance the local economy.
   Typical students are older than the average college student,
female, and living on reservations. At Fort Berthold College in
North Dakota, for example, the average student is 33. Many come to
tribal colleges failing at traditional colleges.
   College presidents are nearly all Indians, and all colleges are
chartered and controlled by tribal advisory and governing boards.
   But most faculty are non-Indian, and low pay and isolation have
led to a high turnover rate, the report found.
   Twelve are fully accredited and eight are candidates for
accreditation, according to the report.
   ``Clearly, tribal colleges are not marginal institutions that
have been `given a break,''' it said.

   East Germans swarmed into Hamburg's
infamous red-light district but found out in a hurry there were
some things their Communist currency couldn't buy.
   ``They all want to pay with aluminum money,'' one St. Pauli
district prostitute complained Saturday night, referring to the
flimsy East German coins.
   Making use of their new travel freedom, East Germans crammed
into Hamburg sex shops as well, leafing through magazines,
examining merchandise and getting a close look at what they've long
been told is Western moral decadence.
   ``It was a madhouse the whole day,'' said one shopowner. ``But
they don't buy anything.''
   Apparently many of the East Germans were holding onto their 100
West German marks _ about $55 _ in ``welcome money'' for other
things _ like buying watches and electronic goods at shops in the
same area.
   ``But it's a real shame they can get only 100 marks,'' said a
clerk at an electronics store.

<UNK>Magistrate Blocks Hindu Construction at Site Claimed by Moslems</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district magistrate on Sunday blocked
construction of a Hindu temple that has ignited violent protests by
Moslems who claim the project infringes on their holy land, a news
agency said.
   Press Trust of India said the fundamentalist Hindu group trying
to build the temple at Ayodhya, 325 miles southeast of New Delhi,
had agred to delay construction pending discussions at a religious
convocation in January.
   At least 300 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem riots in
India since mid-August, when the World Conference of Hindus vowed
to build the temple on a site occupied by a 16th century mosque.
   The foundation of the new temple was placed Friday about 120
feet in front of the Babri Masjid mosque, whose name honors Babar,
one of the Mogul conquerors who introduced Islam to India.
   The ceremony touched off attacks on Hindu temples and shops
Saturday in two neighboring Moslem nations: Bangladesh and
Pakistan, which were part of India before 1947 when the former
British-ruled subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines
into independent nations.
   More protests erupted Sunday. In Lahore, Pakistan, hundreds of
Pakistanis lined a major street, chanting slogans and rattling
placards in opposition to the temple.
   Moslems and Hindus both claim the temple site is sacred to their
religion. Hindus say the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu
temple marking the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most popular
gods in the Hindu pantheon.
   The area's district magistrate, R.S. Srivastava, was quoted
Sunday by Press Trust of India as saying he could not give the
Hindus permission to continue digging at the site as long as the
matter was pending in court.
   Press Trust said the Hindu group building the temple, Vishwa
Hindu Parishad, had agreed to halt work temporarily.
   It quoted the group's general secretary, Ashok Singhal, as
saying a decision on the next course of action would be made during
a Hindu conference in Allahabad on Jan. 27.
   Singhal said last week his group would not try to demolish the
mosque but wanted to remove it ``intact and honorably'' from the
site.
   Moslems say this would set a bad precedent, since they say there
are at least 316 other mosques in India that Hindus claim are built
on Hindu holy places.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday denounced
the planned temple as ``a willful desecration of an Islamic holy
place.'' An Indian foreign ministry spokesman promptly accused her
of ``malicious meddling'' in India's internal affairs.
   Saudi Arabia and Iran also have criticized the Indian government.
   The dispute has become a chief issue in Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's re-election campaign. On Saturday. India's most
influential Islamic clergyman, Syed Abdullah Bukhari, urged Moslems
to vote Gandhi and his Congress Party out of office.
   India has more Moslems than any other country in the world
except Indonesia, even though Indian Moslems form only 11 percent
of the population of 880 million. They traditionally have voted for
the Congress Party, so their alienation could prove crucial in the
elections on Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   India has had a secular government but it has always been headed
by Hindus who make up 82 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Famous Map to Stay at Cathedral With Help From Getty's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEREFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hereford Cathedral has accepted a $4.8
million offer partly financed by oil heir John Paul Getty Jr. to
keep a unique 13th century map of the world off the auction block,
the cathedral announced.
   Dean Peter Haynes said Saturday the cathedral in Hereford,
western England, had agreed to a package of $1.6 million from Getty
and $3.2 million from the state-funded National Heritage Memorial
Fund.
   He said the money will be used to build a new museum on
cathedral grounds and set up a trust to safeguard the map and
ensure it is never sold.
   The plan is to be announced formally Monday.
   The Mappa Mundi, which shows Jerusalem at the center of a flat
world, is considered a national treasure. Its name means ``Map of
the World'' in Latin.
   The dean and the cathedral's governing authority announced a
year ago that the map would be auctioned off, possibly to foreign
buyers, for about $11 million to pay for repairs to the
900-year-old cathedral.
   The map was later withdrawn from auction after a national outcry.
   An alternate plan to collect money by selling public shares of
the map raised only $384,000. The project was scrapped.
   Under the latest plan, the map will be displayed with the
cathedral's other main treasure, a library of medieval books.
   ``The gain to the cathedral will be that there will be a
properly constructed building, sympathetic to the rest of the
cathedral,'' Haynes told reporters.
   ``The Mappa Mundi in the past has been simply in the north choir
aisle, and its place in a new building will allow it to be properly
safeguarded,'' he said.
   Getty, who lives in England, has given millions of dollars to
British institutions. His largest gift was $63 million in 1985 to
buy paintings for the National Gallery in London's Trafalgar Square.
   His father, J. Paul Getty, died in 1976 after creating a U.S.
oil empire. He left behind a fortune of $4 billion.

   There was one voice of discontent in the chorus
of praise for East Germany's decision to open its borders, one
country that could not share the happiness of Germans dancing on
the ruins of Berlin Wall.
   It was the Jewish state.
   Israel, which became home to about 100,000 survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust, had other ruins to remember.
   East Germany's decision to open the borders to the West came on
the anniversary of Kristallnacht, during which the Nazis destroyed
Jewish homes, stores and synagogues, killing 91 Jews and sending
30,000 to concentration camps.
   The night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, was named ``Crystal Night'' by the
Nazis for the shattered glass that covered the streets. In the dark
years that followed, the Nazis killed 6 million Jews.
   When the Jews saw modern-day Germans toasting champagne in the
streets, they could neither forget nor forgive.
   ``When I watched them on the screen, I was happy because of the
people's happiness, I could feel how happy they were ... and I told
myself: `But these are Germans,''' sociologist Yehudit Richter said
in an interview Saturday.
   Mrs. Richter's father was among the twins who suffered barbarous
genetic experiments at the hands of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Her
mother is a concentration camp survivor.
   ``I have never visited Germany and I shall never go there. I can
forgive on a personal level, but on the level of society, I shall
never forgive,'' Mrs. Richter said.
   Leading Israeli newspapers and analysts sounded a bitter note as
they described the events in Berlin, home to 175,000 Jews and one
of the world's largest Jewish communities before World War II.
About 150 Jews live in East Berlin today.
   ``Maybe Germany's reunfication, its climb to European
leadership, are unavoidable,'' the mass-circulation daily Yediot
Ahronot said in an editorial. ``But for God's sake, not in our
generation.''
   The state-run Israel Television interrupted Saturday's flow of
pictures from Germany to interview Gershom Schocken, the elderly
editor of Israel's Haaretz newspaper.
   ``It's very important that Germany stays divided,'' he declared.
``In the 20th century, Germany twice brought incomparable disasters
upon the world.''
   ``The German people of today seek peace, they are cultural and
friendly...but we cannot ignore the German potential that
implemented itself so terribly upon the Jews and other people. One
must hope such things would not be repeated in history, but we
cannot forget them.''
   Shlomo Aronson, a German-educated political scientist from the
Hebrew University, agreed.
   ``My only doubt about reunification is the historic tendency of
Germans, young and old ... to lose control once they are
powerful,'' he said. ``This is the thing that Jews and especially
the Israelis have to be conscious of. In this sense we do have a
right to be sceptical.''
   That skepticism was reflected in a cautious statement by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who praised the changes in Eastern Europe
but said they could be dangerous.
   ``What is happening today in Eastern Europe is an earthquake ..
. They have not reached stability yet ... and that period of
instability carries many dangers,'' said Shamir, whose parents
perished in the Holocaust.
   Israel has never had formal contacts with East Germany because
of its denial of responsibility for Nazi Germany's crimes. Ties
with West Germany, Israel's second-largest trading partner after
the United States, experienced many upheavals.
   A reparations accord came in 1952, followed by the establishment
of diplomatic relations in 1965. Israel's ambivalence toward West
Germany reached its peak in 1981, when then-premier Menachem Begin
told Parliament:
   ``For what happened to the Jewish people in the 1930s and 1940s
in Europe, the entire German people is responsible.''
   No Israeli leader repeated such a claim since. But many Israelis
share the feeling.
   ``We see the wave of history flooding Eastern Europe,''
columnist Yosef Lapid wrote in the daily Maariv, ``and find
ourselves divided between our human identity and our Jewish
destiny.''

<TEXT>
   The spectre of a reunified Germany, awakened by the
opening of the Berlin Wall last week, haunts Frenchmen who remember
German troops marching across the eastern frontier at the beginning
of two world wars.
   ``It seems to me that whenever the Germans are united, they are
united against us,'' comedian Guy Bedos told a French radio
interviewer after the wall was opened Thursday.
   This anxiety has been the motor driving French efforts to
integrate West Germany into a fully federal Europe unified
economically, politically and, perhaps, militarily after 1992.
   France, Italy and others believe that bringing West Germany
firmly into a tightly organized European Community will keep it
from pursuing its own interests as it did in 1870, 1914 and 1939.
   France, the current head of the 12-member European Community, is
bound to place events in Germany at the center of talks among heads
of state at the European Summit in Strasbourg next month.
   The summit was expected to be a showdown between the conflicting
visions of European unity held by French President Francois
Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But last week's events are likely to fuel a common desire to
find compromise on issues such as monetary union and a European
social charter and to move quickly toward completing the plan for
unification.
   French leaders Friday urged that the European Community members
open their borders with the same speed as shown by East German
officials in opening the wall splitting Berlin.
   ``Democratization should be pursued first of all within East
Germany itself,'' said former conservative President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, now a member of the European Parliament. ``And, during
this period, (I hope we) will not lose time in pursuing our own
union.''
   French angst is fed by the knowledge that West Germany _ big and
powerful with a population numerous and industrious _ already is a
formidable force.
   In the first half of this year, the country's gross national
product blasted ahead at a 4.6 percent annual rate, the quickest
rise in 13 years. Exports for the first seven months of 1989 were
18 percent higher than last year's record pace.
   West German business interests reach into all corners of Europe,
and in many markets it is Japan's main competitor.
   If joined with East Germany, the nation would have more than 80
million people out of a total Western European population of about
320 million and a gross domestic product almost as big as Britain's
and France's combined.
   It would have the biggest army in Europe outside the Soviet
Union _ a fact that has not gone unnoticed in Paris.
   ``Relations with Germany have been, since the beginning of the
century, a major problem,'' wrote political observer Alain
Peyrefitte in an editorial in the conservative daily Le Figaro.
``The two Germanys divided between NATO and the European Community
on the one side and the Warsaw Pact on the other, furnished a
solution to the problem.''
   ``All of this is now in question...'' and the balance of power
is about ``to be upset,'' he wrote.
   West Germany is already the chief Western trading partner of the
Soviet Union and its East bloc allies, and it is well positioned by
a number of factors, including language, to benefit from the new
free-market economies emerging in Poland and Hungary.
   France, like other European Community members, worries that West
German attraction to the east will dampen its enthusiasm for
European integration.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has said
he fears West Germany might be ``tempted by a destiny other than
the construction of Europe.''
   Delors met behind closed doors in Brussels on Friday night with
the 17 European Community commissions to discuss German
reunification, the first debate ever held on the possibility.
   Discussions focused on ways to incorporat East Germany _ and
possibly other East Bloc countries _ into the Common Market
framework.

   Danish and Canadian geologists have
discovered a huge gold deposit in Greenland, reportedly one of the
largest ever found, a Danish newspaper reported Sunday.
   Jyllands-Posten in its Sunday edition said the gold find is on
Greenland's east coast and covers about 1.6 square miles. Greenland
is a semi-autonomous part of Denmark.
   The paper, quoting the Canadian trade magazine Northern Mining,
compared the size of the gold find to the mines in South Africa,
one of the world's biggest gold producers.
   The extraction of the gold could begin in five years, said the
daily, adding that scientists calculated the deposit could yield 12
tons of the precious metal each year.
   ``It was quite unusual to find gold in that kind of rock,'' the
paper quoted C.K. Brooks from the Institute for Petrology at the
Copenhagen University as saying.

   Children whose schools were destroyed in a series

   The earthquakes struck Shanxi province about 140 miles west of
Beijing from early to mid-October. The strongest measured 7.1 on
the Richter scale and toppled more than 27,000 homes.
   At least 29 people were killed and 150 injured, news reports
said. More than 50,000 were reportedly left homeless.
   The quakes destroyed 2,350 classrooms, the official Xinhua news
agency said Sunday.
   Local authorities set aside $160,000 to rebuild the schools and
buy 300 tents so classes could start again, Xinhua said.
   The tents were taken to the area Friday, but the report did not
say when classes would resume.

<TEXT>
   The election victory of Moslem
fundamentalists who call for an alcohol ban, greater segregation of
the sexes and more Islamic teaching in schools has alarmed many of
the country's Christians.
   The Moslem Brotherhood captured two seats in this half-Christian
hilltop city of 95,000 people, where church spires and mosque
minarets dot the skyline.
   To the consternation of many Christians, the third seat was won
by Dr. Saad Haddadin, a Christian who campaigned under the slogan
``Islam is the Solution.'' He denies receiving Brotherhood support.
   Moslem activists captured at least 34 of the 80 Parliament seats
in Wednesday's election.
   Christians make up only about 6 percent of Jordan's 3 million
people, but their rights of worship and their customs traditionally
have been protected.
   Christian women in Western dress, Orthodox priests in black
robes, liquor stores and ancient churches are common sights in the
steep, narrow streets of Madaba, 25 miles southwest of the capital
Amman.
   On a nearby ridge to the west is Mount Nebo, where the Bible
says Moses first saw the promised land, and where he was buried.
   Under Jordan's election system, Madaba has one of the nine
Parliament seats reserved for Christians, and 12 candidates
contested it.
   As a result, the Christian vote was split a dozen ways. Haddadin
captured the seat by winning Moslem votes with the tacit support of
the Brotherhood.
   ``He was the weakest candidate, but he won because of his
alliance with the Brotherhood,'' said engineer Aouni Twal, a
Christian. ``Our Jesus, he said a little bit of wine is not bad.
But this Dr. Saad, he refuses to say he won't ban alcohol.''
   Election banners stretched above Madaba streets proclaimed
``Islam is the Solution, Vote for Dr. Saad Haddadin,'' copying the
Brotherhood's nationwide slogan. But the winner denied they backed
him.
   ``Since I am a Christian, I cannot be with the Brotherhood and
they would never accept me,'' Haddadin, 41, said as he received
congratulations from well-wishers in the nearby village of Main.
   Although asked several times, he refused to say specifically
whether he supported Islamists' demands for banning alcohol, for
more sexual segregation and the introduction of strict Moslem
Sharia law.
   ``Everything that is good for my country, I am the first one to
support it,'' he said.
   Asked if he thought the Christian community in Madaba would
accept the introduction of Moslem Sharia law, he said: ``I don't
know. I cannot say.''
   Middle-class Christians in Amman worry that the Brotherhood
could increase its influence in the Education Ministry to impose
more Islamic teaching and Islamic dress codes, including some form
of veiling for women.
   In what was seen as a move to reassure Christians, King Hussein
vowed in a post-election news conference that ``the rights of all
Jordanians are sacred, and they are rights that will not be
affected.''
   Although many Christians were visibly nervous following the
fundamentalists' strong showing in the first nationwide ballot in
22 years, some cautioned against assuming there would be radical
change.
   ``As a Christian from the Middle East I have no fears whatsover
of genuine Islam,'' said Rami Khoury, a political observer and
former editor of the English-language Jordan Times.
   ``What we should be careful of are distorted or exaggerated
sentiments that impose restrictions reflecting social traditions
rather than religious dictates.''

<HEAD>Rockets Rocket Attack Kills 13; Salang Highway Reportedly Cut Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rocket slammed into a house while
three generations of a family were having tea Sunday, killing 13
people, witnesses said. It was one of 11 rocket attacks reported by
the government.
   An additional three people were injured in the other attacks.
   Elsewhere, U.S.-backed rebel forces reportedly closed the
highway again connecting the capital to the Soviet Union, sparking
new fears of shortages. The government denied the Salang Highway
was closed, but soldiers said buses bound for a provincial capital,
Mazar-e-Sharif, had been turned back and that fighting near the
Salang tunnel was fierce.
   The fatal rocket attack occurred at 2:30 p.m. in the northwest
corner of Kabul, across the street from the Continental Hotel where
many foreign reporters stay. Witnesses said the rocket went through
the roof of a two-story house and exploded in the living room.
   Three generations of a family had just sat down to tea, they
said. The shrapnel from the rocket killed everybody in the room,
they said.
   The United States supplies rockets to the Moslem guerrillas, who
have been fighting the Soviet-backed government more than a decade.
It could not be immediately determined what kind of missile hit the
house, but people in the neighborhood blamed the United States.
   ``Tell the Americans that we are sick of this war,'' said a
woman who lives next door to the stricken house. ``These could have
been my children and my parents dead here. This is not a war for
freedom; it is a war against the people.''
   The attacks Sunday marked the first time in four days that
rockets have hit Kabul. On Saturday, the government claimed it was
clearing the guerrillas from the hills surrounding the capital.
   Since June, rocket attacks on Kabul have killed about 400
people. Half the victims have been children, according to the
International Committee of the Red Cross. The government says the
rebels are responsible for the attacks, but the rebels deny it.
   The frequent attacks are souring the population's once strong
support for the rebels, or mujahedeen, who are credited with
chasing the Soviet Red Army from Afghanistan. The Soviets withdrew
the last of their troops from Afghanistan in February.
   ``Before the rockets began, the people had hope for a good
change in Afghanistan,'' said Trina Nawabi, a doctor. ``Now, they
feel the mujahedeen have let them down.''
   Soldiers with knowledge of the Salang Highway said rebel and
government forces were fighting north of the town of Carikar on the
highway. They said rebel forces succeeded in shutting down the
highway near the town of Salang.
   Soldiers said government troops would probably open the road in
one or two days.
   ``It is always like this,'' said a captain in the government
army. ``They have it for a few days, we have it for a week.''
   The guerrillas closed the highway for 10 days late last month,
causing prices of flour and gasoline to jump 50 percent because
supplies could not be driven in from the Soviet border.
   Since it opened again in early November, more than 2,000 trucks
have rolled into the capital, Kabul.
   Soldiers said thousands of trucks carrying food are waiting to
head south from Hayratan, the main depot for goods from the Soviet
Union. Afghan news reports say Moscow has sent more than 200,000
metric tons of goods via Hayratan since the last Soviet soldiers
withdrew from Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Beer, Ice Cream in Short Supply as East Meets West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haagen-Dazs ran out of ice cream bars Sunday, a
rare occurrence in November. Burger King was out of beer by early
afternoon. Even cash machines were empty as more than a million
visitors swarmed through West Berlin.
   East Germans crossing the now-porous Berlin Wall, and West
Berliners drawn to the impromptu international street festival,
bought all the fruit and coffee available and flooded businesses
from pretzel stands to peep shows.
   Hordes of East Germans grabbed everything from lettuce to
radios, cleaning out stores in West German cities and towns near
the border, from Luebeck in the north to Hof in Bavaria.
   City officials, restaurateurs and shopkeepers found their
supplies of goods falling short, but their good will appeared to be
holding out against the onslaught.
   Bakers rose earlier than usual Sunday to make extra batches of
pretzels and pots of coffee for the chilled but hearty revelers who
had walked West Berlin's streets through the night.
   Crowds of gawking East Germans filled the Leysieffer
confectionary store and cafe in the morning, discouraging the usual
well-heeled cappuccino sippers.
   Klaus Meyer, a barkeeper at the Joe Am Kudamm disco, said
patrons broke or stole 1,000 glasses Friday.
   The Haagen-Dazs shop on Kurfuerstendamm street sold all of its
ice cream bars.
   ``Normally we sell two to three a day at this time of year.
Yesterday we sold 300,'' said George Shampro-Mario from behind the
counter.
   Burger King, which had 45-minute lines, ran out of beer by early
afternoon and was running out of food as well.
   Westerners who wanted to join the party risked running short of
cash.
   The automatic tellers that dispense cash along Berlin's main
streets were empty of marks. Although banks were kept open to
dispense the 100-mark ($55) gifts to the visiting East Germans,
such services to Westerners were shut as usual Sunday.
   The Berlin Red Cross brought disposable diapers and baby food to
lines of young families snaked along Berlin's major streets as the
visitors waited hours for their pocket money.
   City officials said every cot and corner of emergency shelters
was full before the weekend, when well over a million visitors
arrived each day, and that families appealing for a warm place to
stay overnight had to be put into movie theaters.
   The number of subway cars in service was boosted 50 percent, but
it was jammed around the clock.
   Seventy special tour buses were dispatched to shuttle the
visitors along West Berlin's major thoroughfares, but they quickly
stalled in bumper-to-bumper traffic.
   Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's stylish shopping boulevard, was
finally closed to vehicles late Saturday because of the crush of
pedestrians filling the streets. Traffic resumed Sunday morning
after the overnight sea of strollers and window-shoppers dwindled.
   Even Berlin's seamier attractions proved insufficient to meet
demand. Andreas Schulz, a bouncer at a peep show across from the
West Berlin train station, said his employer's decision to accept
the non-convertible East German mark as payment brought 50,000
customers to the neon-lighted establishment between Thursday night
and Sunday morning.
   Long lines also formed at sex shops.
   There are no such businesses in East Berlin. East Germany
insisted that one reason it built the wall was to shield East
Germans from such things as western pornography.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia's government and rebels from the Tigre
province wrapped up a preliminary meeting over the weekend and will
hold a second set of peace talks next month, the Italian government
said Sunday.
   The rebels and the Marxist government held a week of preliminary
talks in Rome that ended Saturday, with the Italian government
acting as host and observer.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the talks
took place in an ``open and constructive atmosphere, despite the
presence of difficulties.''
   The discussions were aimed at clearing the way for formal peace
negotiations.
   The talks between the government and the Tigre People's
Liberation Front will resume Dec. 12 in Rome, the ministry said.
   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting for 14 years to win
greater autonomy. They have scored several major battlefield
victories in recent weeks.
   The government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam opened
preliminary peace talks with a second major rebel group, the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front, in September. They are
scheduled to resume in Nairobi, Kenya, later this month.
   Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1936, but the Italian forces were
defeated by the Allies in 1941.

<HEAD>Advocates Say Shultz Conversion Will Add Fuel to Drug Legalization
Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conversion of former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz has experts predicting others from across the
political spectrum will join ranks with those who see
decriminalization as a workable solution to the drug problem.
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett
acknowledges that Shultz may draw others with him, but argues that
legalization is a ``dopey idea'' and a ``moral disaster'' that
won't wash with anyone who has been ``within five miles of a crack
house.''
   Nevertheless, legalization proponents are trumpeting an October
speech by Shultz that appeared in adapted form in The Wall Street
Journal as a major step toward moving the once-radical viewpoint
into the mainstream.
   The political mix of legalization advocates is already broad. On
the conservative side are Shultz, who headed President Reagan's
State Department and President Nixon's Treasury Department,
economist Milton Friedman and political commentator William F.
Buckley. The liberal side includes Democratic Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore, a former prosecutor, Hodding Carter III, journalist and
chief State Department spokesman in the Carter administration, and
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
   ``The liberal-conservative definitions keep crumbling,''
Princeton University's Ethan Nadelmann said in an interview. ``Each
is split into libertarian and social control groups.''
   Some legalization advocates say the issue simply needs to be
addressed, while others call for controlled legalization with
alcohol-like regulations for drugs such as marijuana, and more
restrictive rules for more dangerous drugs.
   Most say President Bush's anti-drug strategy, developed by
Bennett, is more of the same law enforcement programs that have not
worked in the past.
   In an open letter to Bennett published in The Wall Street
Journal on Sept. 7 _ two days after Bush presented the strategy in
a prime-time television address _ Friedman wrote: ``The path you
propose of more police, more jails, use of the military in foreign
countries, harsh penalties for drug users, and a whole panoply of
repressive measures can only make a bad situation worse. The drug
war cannot be won by those tactics without undermining the human
liberty and individual freedom that you and I cherish.''
   The column by Shultz _ like Friedman, a denizen of the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University _ was less vitriolic but made
similar arguments.
   ``It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we
can take the criminality out of the drug business and the
incentives for criminality out of it,'' Shultz wrote. ``Frankly,
the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it
possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a
price that approximates their cost. ... We need at least to
consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs.''
   Shultz declined to be interviewed for this article.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, on hearing about
Shultz's column, quipped, ``Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast
too long, hasn't he? The guy slips into retirement and right away
he starts saying things that are strange.''
   Fitzwater then reiterated Bush's opposition to legalization,
``that it is not a moral position for the United States to take;
and that it makes no sense whatsoever.''
   Bennett said in an interview that he understands the legalizers'
arguments and has concluded: ``It's a dopey idea.''
   He acknowledged, however, that the legal movement is ``going
somewhere. It's going around intellectual salons and the academy,
libertarians, and it's getting currency with people who want more
than anything else to be au courant. But it doesn't hold up, it
doesn't make any sense, it's a moral disaster.''
   Given Shultz's background and his straight-arrow image, he
``will carry some people along, but he won't carry people along who
have been within five miles of a crack house, anybody who has seen
the devastation of a crack house and been to a hospital and seen
the devastation of crack babies,'' Bennett said.
   Said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control: ``For eight years as
secretary of state, George Shultz never said a word about drugs.
... No wonder drug control was not a foreign policy priority of the
Reagan administration; Shultz did not and does not believe in it.
Now we learn he wants to give up altogether.''
   Shultz's tenure at the State Department coincided with increased
U.S. interdiction efforts and congressional requirements that
foreign governments prove their cooperation in the drug war to get
their full allocation of foreign aid.
   Despite the criticisms, Nadelmann said, ``There is a political
movement growing.
   ``I predict with some confidence that within the next nine to 12
months, you're going to see a lot more George Shultz-type people
coming out,'' Nadelmann said at a recent conference on legalization
arranged by the Drug Policy Foundation.
   ``What you are going to have one or two years from now is a
critical mass of people across the political spectrum, across the
career spectrum, across the color spectrum, in favor of
legalization, and it's going to make it a legitimate argument,'' he
said.
   Schmoke recently welcomed Shultz's entry into the fray, saying,
``I want to congratulate him on his candor and realism.''

   Until Sunday, one of the most poignant sights in
this city scarred by enmity was that of the rusting tram lines
running under the Berlin Wall in West Berlin at Potsdamer Platz.
   From a wooden platform nearby, visitors peering over the grim
concrete barricade could see what had become of the square that
once was the vibrant city center _ the Times Square or Picadilly
Circus of central Europe.
   A vast death strip dotted with concrete watchtowers had replaced
the cafes where playwright Bertolt Brecht caroused in the 1920s.
   Where bustling Berliners once traded and changed trams, there
was only an eerie emptiness and silence.
   On Sunday, the silence and some of the ghostly atmosphere lifted
as East German soldiers removed enough slabs from either side of
the no-man's-land to allow the mayors of East and West Berlin, and
then thousands of their citizens, to meet.
   For the first time since the wall blocked them 28 years ago, the
tram lines could be seen in full, running through into East Berlin
on a cobbled street that survived both Adolf Hitler's war and the
ensuing Cold War.
   ``Perhaps,'' mused an East Berlin woman wistfully as she waited
in the gray mist to cross to the West, ``perhaps there'll be a tram
line running here again soon.''
   Only a week ago, that was inconceivable.
   ``We want to look through the Brandenburg Gate from the other
side,'' said East Berliner Wolfgang Rosenloecher, standing with his
wife Monika.
   ``Just last week, we were walking there, saying to ourselves
perhaps we'll get there before we are pensioners. But we never
thought it would happen so quickly.''
   Rosenloecher, 62, came here many times between 1951 and 1961,
when the wall was built. ``This was where the drivers of the trams
changed, between the Western and Eastern zones. Over there,'' he
pointed into the no-man's-land on either side of the wall, ``that
was the market where the easterners could buy stuff in their
currency.''
   ``And of course,'' he sighed, ``Potsdamer Platz was one of the
places where the most happened on June 17.''
   On that day in 1953, Soviet tanks rumbled over the cobblestones
to crush a workers' revolt against East Germany's Communist
government.
   On Sunday, such cruel memories were in the past.
   East Berlin's mayor Erhard Krack walked past the dismembered
slabs of the wall into West Berlin and shook hands with his West
Berlin counterpart, Wolfgang Momper.
   In contrast to the quiet, orderly crowd of about 1,000 on the
eastern side, the 10,000 or so in West Berlin were in noisy high
spirits.
   ``Let us in! We want to go and have breakfast on the Alex!''
they cried, referring to the Alexanderplatz square in downtown East
Berlin.
   Hundreds climbed the wall and swarmed into the former death
strip. Watched by bemused East German border guards, a long-haired
``rocker'' dressed in black leather careened around, shouting ``I
can't believe it! The Wall has gone!''
   Hundreds of impatient easterners left to seek another less
crowded crossing.
   Rosenloecher and his wife didn't budge. ``We used to use every
opportunity we could to look across to the West, climbing the high
apartment houses ... or to the top of the cathedral,'' said Mrs.
Rosenloecher. ``We can wait now.''

<HEAD>Partial Gramm-Rudman Cuts Now Seem Likely to Stick</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders deadlocked with White
House officials in their search for $14 billion in budget savings
now seem ready to let the guillotine of the Gramm-Rudman law do
some of the work for them.
   The willingness to permanently retain a portion of the $16.1
billion in cuts to most federal programs imposed last month by the
balanced-budget law comes from Democrats and Republicans alike, and
reverses congressional sentiment that prevailed until recently.
   ``If that becomes the litmus test or quid pro quo for the
administration agreeing to ... (a deficit-reduction bill), then
it's not off the table,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn., said last Thursday.
   The ranking Republican on the Senate budget panel, Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, said bipartisan talks aimed at finding a way to
reduce this year's projected $116 billion shortfall are moving ``in
the direction of a compromise that will have some across-the-board
cuts'' in federal spending.
   The only real question at this point appears to be the degree to
which the cuts will be left in place. As a rule of thumb, roughly
$1 billion is saved for each month the cuts are retained.
   Turning to partial Gramm-Rudman slashes for some savings is the
latest twist to ongoing Democratic-Republican efforts to do one of
two things. Each side wants to either agree to a deficit-reduction
bill coupled with some savings from Gramm-Rudman cuts, or to find a
way to blame the other party if their efforts fail and the full
Gramm-Rudman reductions remain in effect all year.
   The balanced-budget law triggered the $16.1 billion in cuts on
Oct. 16, when Congress and President Bush failed to agree to a plan
to shrink the deficit to $110 billion. At the time, the working
assumption on Capitol Hill was that the cuts would be rolled back
when a plan to reduce the shortfall was sculpted.
   But after weeks of fruitless searching for a deficit-reduction
deal, the Gramm-Rudman cuts remain in place. Bush says he'd prefer
retaining the across-the-board slashes to enactment of the
budget-cutting bills passed by the Senate and House, which he
complains contain billions of dollars in phony savings, such as
shifting payments out of the fiscal year.
   Although the Gramm-Rudman reductions have barely been felt so
far, their pain will become more apparent if left intact much
longer as agencies are forced to save money. The law has imposed
4.3 percent reductions in defense spending and 5.3 percent cuts in
most domestic programs, excluding Social Security and initiatives
for the poor.
   To avoid that scenario, Democrats want to move a
deficit-reduction measure through Congress by Thanksgiving that
restores most of the Gramm-Rudman reductions _ a plan they believe
puts pressure on Bush.
   ``If the president wants to sign it, which I think would be the
responsible thing to do, I'd applaud him,'' said Sasser. ``If he
chooses to veto it, that's regrettable and he'll have to take the
consequences of that.''
   Some lawmakers do not see things that way. Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, has been a
staunch defender of Bush's threat to veto an inadequate
deficit-reduction measure and leave the Gramm-Rudman cuts intact.
   Packwood wrote to Bush last week that retaining the Gramm-Rudman
cuts is ``not the worst outcome'' is the alternative is a
deficit-cutting bill ``that relies upon budget gimmicks and
accounting devices, contains almost no long-term deficit reduction,
and sets the stage for a true budget crisis next year.''
   Indeed, lawmakers are drawing differing conclusions about just
how damaging retention of the Gramm-Rudman cuts will be.
   Ranking House Budget Committee Republican Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota circulated an analysis last week concluding that the cuts
are ``a mixed bag.'' The Defense Department could have to pare its
active-duty personnel by 170,000 troops, but the Federal Aviation
Administration would be able to juggle its budget and protect air
traffic controllers, Frenzel wrote.
   Yet Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on
the House Appropriations Committee, said the cuts ``will have
severe negative impacts on hundreds of programs.'' He wrote of 2
million farmers facing support payment reductions, AIDS service
cuts, and 250,000 fewer Pell Grants to college students.
   One key impediment to Congress' budget work appears ready to be
laid aside for the rest of the year next week.
   The Senate plans votes Tuesday and Wednesday on a proposal to
cut the tax on capital gains, a plan Bush has fought for all year.
If GOP supporters of the plan lose _ as expected _ they have
promised to not raise the issue again until next year.
   Republican insistence on trying to attach the plan to crucial
budget bills has slowed work on those measures in recent weeks.

   Luella Wilson's tiny frame and stooped
walk are misleading. This 91-year-old woman, who stands to lose her
home and life savings because of an unusual court case, is tough.
   In her younger years, Wilson stood her ground on hunting
expeditions for coyotes and moose; trophies hang in her home to
prove her success. She also ran her family's dude ranch for years,
caring for up to 52 horses until last year.
   Shuffling around her cluttered home and pointing out prized
possessions, Wilson boasts that she once owned a nightclub and
``handled'' eight bartenders _ not to mention rowdy patrons.
   But Wilson fears she's finally met her match in the legal system.
   She's uncharacteristically confused, tangled in a legal
nightmare she says is not of her own making, but which threatens to
cost her everything she has collected over her nine-plus decades.
   Wilson's troubles began in 1984 when she gave her great-nephew,
Willard Stuart, $6,300 for his 18th birthday to buy a car. Although
Stuart did not have a driver's license _ Wilson knew that when she
gave him the money _ he drove the car.
   Three weeks later, after a night of heavy drinking and smoking
marijuana, Stuart drove the car off a bridge. A backseat passenger,
Mark Vince, was paralyzed and later had a leg amputated.
   The passenger sued Wilson, saying she knew that Stuart did not
have a license and that he used drugs, and therefore was negligent
in giving him money to buy a car.
   A Superior Court jury agreed, ordering Wilson to pay the
passenger $950,000 in damages. Her home has been inventoried for
sale and her savings locked up by the courts.
   The Vermont Supreme Court, however, says others may share the
blame with Wilson, including the dealership that sold Stuart the
vehicle. A Superior Court jury will decide that question in
December.
   ``He used to be my favorite nephew,'' Wilson said last week.
``His mother used to get him up in the morning, dress him, and he
would come running through my meadow and stay here with me all
day.''
   Although he still lives nearby, Wilson hasn't talked to Stuart
since the verdict and has seen him only in passing as he drives by
her home.
   ``I don't know if he feels so bad about it that he doesn't want
to talk to me,'' she said. ``When you get into an awful mess, you
don't know how people are going to feel about it.''
   Publicity over Wilson's plight has sparked a wave of support,
and her kitchen table is littered with about 50 letters from people
offering money or assistance.
   Others around the nation are watching this case because of its
precedent-setting potential.
   They say there would be enormous ramifications if the court
finds either the dealership or salesman negligent for selling the
car to someone who did not have a license and was later in an
accident.
   Such a ruling could affect banks, other car dealerships, or
anyone who lends or gives money to another individual.
   The passenger's attorney, Rolf Sternberg, told The New York
Times recently that the ruling is in keeping with legal doctrine
that a person who gives a dangerous tool to another is liable for
any resulting damage, and said Wilson's claims of poverty are
exaggerated.
   ``She is not destitute,'' Sternberg said. ``The court order said
her assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to live
adequately. Somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fair
and impartial jury.''
   Wilson says the law is wrong, that there is no one to blame but
those directly involved in the accident. She believes she is guilty
only of giving her nephew a certified check and the sole reason she
was sued is that she is the only one with any money.
   Wilson, who was hospitalized last month after collapsing in her
kitchen, vows to attend court in December, saying her failure to
attend the original proceeding and tell her side of the story may
have cost her the case.
   ``When you have to walk so far, you can't go into a place like
that,'' Wilson said of the courthouse.
   For now, her world is her home. She smiles at the good old days
even as she awaits the court's decision.
   The lesson to be learned? ``If you have any relatives, just
don't give them nothing. Don't give them any money,'' Wilson said.

<HEAD>Administration Officials Say New Soviet Weapons Deployment Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top administration officials insisted Sunday
that the Kremlin continues to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons,
although a published report said some deployments had been cut in
anticipation of an arms control deal.
   ``The fact of the matter is the Soviets have continued to
modernize their strategic forces,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press.''
   Cheney did not flatly deny a report published Sunday in The
Washington Post that quoted unidentified government sources as
saying the Soviets had stopped producing four new weapons, the
SS-18 and SS-24 missile, the Blackjack Bomber and the Typhoon
submarine, and had suspended work on an aircraft carrier.
   The Post said the reports, apparently based on satellite
photography, conflicted with recent statements by Cheney and Vice
President Dan Quayle that the Soviets continued to deploy new
weapons.
   Responding to that assertion, Cheney said the Soviets might have
slowed deployments of some new systems in order not to exceed a
ceiling proposed for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which
would slash long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to
50 percent.
   That treaty is not expected to be the centerpiece of a summit
planned for Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean Sea. Senior U.S.
officials have said the START deal might be ready for another
meeting between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev slated for
next spring or summer.
   Cheney said the Kremlin was replacing many of its older nuclear
weapons with more modern bombers, ballistic missiles and
submarines, the three legs of the so-called strategic triad.
   ``In effect what I think would be fair to say is that by the
late '90s, even if you have a START agreement, the Soviets will
have changed out, completely replaced, modernized, every single leg
of the triad,'' Cheney said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that despite the
moderate new tone of Kremlin rhetoric, ``the Soviet Union still
remains a very heavily armed superpower.''
   Commenting on reports that the Soviets had stopped deploying
SS-18's, SS-24's, Blackjacks and Typhoon submarines, Baker said:
``As far as I know, that has not been established.
   ``We do believe that the Soviets are, in keeping with what they
have told us, reducing their production of conventional weapons,''
said Baker, appearing on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   ``But as yet, we do not have firm evidence, in my opinion, that
they have begun reducing their expenditures for strategic weapons.
They may have. We may be able to establish that later,'' he said.
   Addressing the broader issue of how the United States should
respond to changes in the Soviet Union, Baker, said ``politically,
the Soviet Union is saying and acting in a way that does indeed
make it harder to argue the threat. The threat itself, in terms of
military power, is still there.
   ``So we really should not disarm ... until the time comes to do
so in light of actual Soviet actions,'' he said.
   Cheney did not directly discuss continuing SS-24, Blackjack and
Typhoon production, but said the Soviets ``are deploying a new
version of the SS-18,'' a heavy strategic missile.
   ``They've deployed two new ballistic missiles that are mobile _
the SS-24 and the SS-25, and this year they've deployed two new
ballistic missile submarines, the sixth Typhoon and the sixth Delta
IV. So the pace continues,'' he said.
   ``I don't think there's any realistic expectation that the
Soviets will have anything other than a very modern strategic force
for the foreseeable future,'' he said.
   He said that the change in the Soviet strategic arsenal was
``not a net increase so much as it's a more capable force. That is
to say you're taking out older systems and putting in new ones.''

   A 7 percent jump in robberies paced a 5
percent increase in violent crime during the first half of this
year, according to FBI statistics released Sunday.
   Overall, reported crimes went up 3 percent during the first half
of 1989 from the same period last year, with each of the nation's
four regions posting increases, the bureau said in its Uniform
Crime Report.
   By comparison, the FBI's overall crime index increased 1 percent
during both the first halves of 1987 and 1988 and went up 8 percent
during the first six months of 1986.
   There was a 4 percent increase in overall crime reports in both
the South and the West. Crime went up 2 percent in the Midwest and
3 percent in the Northeast, the report said.
   Among various categories of crime, the biggest increase was an
11 percent jump in motor vehicle thefts, followed by a 7 percent
hike in robberies.
   Murders increased 5 percent over the same period last year,
while aggravated assaults went up 4 percent.
   The number of murders in the first half of 1988 was virtually
unchanged from the same period in 1987, when there was a 2 percent
drop from the same period in 1986, the bureau said.
   The number of murders went up 7 percent in the South and 6
percent in the West. There was a 1 percent increase in reported
homicides in the Northeast and a 4 percent increase in the Midwest.
   Murders increased 15 percent in cities with populations between
500,000 and a million. Homicides increased 10 percent in cities
with populations between 100,000 and 250,000.
   But the increase in murders was not confined to large urban
areas.
   Killings increased 11 percent in cities with with populations
between 25,000 and 50,000 and 7 percent in towns with populations
under 10,000.
   Suburban counties reported a 6 percent decrease in murders.
   The West had the biggest increase in motor vehicle thefts _ 16
percent _ followed by 10 percent increases in both the South and
the Northeast. Motor vehicle thefts went up 5 percent in the
Midwest.
   The overall 11 percent increase followed an 8 percent jump in
motor vehicle thefts during the same period in 1988.
   Larcenies and thefts went up 3 percent between January and June
while the number of reported burglaries was off 1 percent.
   Forcible rapes dropped 2 percent and reports of arson went down
4 percent from the first six months of 1988.

   The line that carved Germany
into two nations could not have come closer to the farmhouse where
Waleska Von Hagen was born.
   ``My father's land was divided down the middle,'' she said.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Von Hagen was among hundreds of people from the
little West German town of Wanfried who suddenly decided to push
across the border to look at the little East German village of
Katharinenberg.
   Much to the dizzying confusion of border guards, hundreds of
equally curious Katharinenberg residents traveled the four miles to
look at Wanfried.
   Authorities announced early Sunday that the road between the two
border towns would be one of the new crossings opened for the first
time in three decades.
   Hundreds of East Germans began crossing into West Germany to
visit Wanfried and gawk at its relative opulence.
   At Katharinenberg, guards stamped passports or identity cards of
East Germans at a makeshift control point but were overwhelmed by
the numbers and gave up within an hour.
   Although the open border was meant more for East Germans who had
been denied travel privileges for 28 years, Wanfried residents were
eager to look at their East German sister city.
   Hundreds of townspeople from Wanfried, which has 3,000
residents, walked up a wooded lane to the wire-mesh fence to cheer
the East Germans as they crossed into the West German town.
   Several East Germans on foot waved hand-printed signs reading,
``Freiheit,'' the German word for ``freedom.''
   Suddenly, a crowd of West Germans surged forward past the
guards, who watched with stunned looks, and began heading East.
   ``Now we're going to see how you live on the other side,'' said
one West German to a man walking in the other direction.
   ``You won't find anybody in Katharinenberg,'' the East German
responded. ``They have all gone across the border.''
   One of the first West Germans to reach this village was Mrs. Von
Hagen, who said she was born in a farmhouse just over the border on
the West German side.
   She said Gen. George S. Patton and a Soviet officer met in her
father's living room and signed the agreement that drew the border
for this region.
   ``I've never been able to come here before. We were never
allowed,'' she said, looking at the simple village homes.
   Asked what she thought of the East German village, she said,
``It's like going back 40 years in time.''
   Border guards abandoned any attempt to stop the tide of laughing
and waving West Germans heading to Katharinenberg.
   ``You have to have your passport. The regulations are still the
same,'' an East German guard told West Germans who bothered to ask.
``But at the moment we can't do anything.''

   President Daniel Ortega's biggest
problem in his party's campaign to retain power may not be the
U.S.-backed political opposition, but the large number of undecided
voters.
   The results of three opinion polls put the undecided figure at
35 percent to 46 percent heading into the Feb. 25 balloting.
   This could lend credence to charges by Washington and opposition
groups that Ortega this month ended a cease-fire with the Contras
in order to create a crisis and have an excuse to call off
elections the Sandinistas fear they might lose.
   The thinking is that if the leftist Sandinista government has
not won support from a clear majority after 10 years in power, it
will be hard-pressed to do so in the brief time remaining before
the general elections.
   In all three polls, those who said they will vote in the
elections ranged from 78.4 percent to 95 percent.
   Ortega had been leading in most polls except the latest one, in
which publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was favored by 42.8
percent of those surveyed, to Ortega's 21.3 percent.
   Still, even in that poll, 35 percent of the respondents were
either unsure of who they would for vote or did not answer the
question. The remaining .9 percent favored five other presidential
candidates from tiny parties.
   That poll, released last week, was conducted Oct. 23-30 by the
Costa Rican firm of Borge and Associates for La Prensa, the
Nicaraguan opposition daily owned by Mrs. Chamorro's family; and El
Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language edition of The Miami Herald.
   It surveyed 1,284 Nicaraguans nationwide and had a margin of
error of 4 percent.
   Delegations from the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels are
to resume negotiations Monday at the Organization of American
States in Washington.
   Ortega is intent on having the estimated 12,000 Contras
demobilize from their Honduran jungle camps before the elections.
The Contras have said they will stay put until the elections take
place.
   As an incentive, Ortega has offered to resume at the end of this
month the cease-fire he suspended Nov. 1, after it had been in
effect since March 1988.
   Renewed fighting between Sandinistas and Contras would make
campaigning impossible. But critics say the Sandinistas want the
Contras eliminated as a pressure force in order to have a freer
hand should election results not be in their favor.
   Two other polls have given Ortega the upper hand over Mrs.
Chamorro.
   One poll was conducted Oct. 2-7 by the Nicaraguan firm ECO for
the Central American University in Managua. In it, 78.4 percent of
the 4,114 people answering said they would vote in the elections.
   Of those surveyed, 36.5 percent said they would vote for the
Sandinistas, 18.1 percent for the opposition and 41.8 percent were
undecided or did not answer the question.
   In another poll, by the Nicaraguan Institute of Public Opinion,
83 percent of the 1,157 people surveyed said they would vote.
Twenty-six percent said they would vote for Ortega; 21 percent for
Mrs. Chamorro; and 46 percent were undecided or did not answer the
question.
   That poll was conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 2.
   By the same token, the percentage of undecideds sends a strong
message to Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party bloc, the National Opposition
Union: that Nicaraguans do not consider it a good alternative to
the Sandinistas.
   ``That showing of people who pretend they don't know who they're
going to vote for is a Latin American phenomenon,'' said a Latin
American diplomat of long experience. ``What these people are
saying is `We're going to vote for the least bad (candidate),' and
it's the decisive vote in any election.
   ``That also shows clearly the wasting away of Sandinista fervor
over these 10 years. This is due to several reasons, but the main
one is their not having been able to solve ... the socio -economic
problem.''
   ``Everything Will Be Better,'' the Sandinista campaign slogan,
is an acknowledgement that the economy must be improved. But the
promise rings hollow when living conditions are on an unrelenting
downslide with no apparent end in sight.
   Ortega's government has been battling hyperinflation with a
tough austerity program that has slashed government spending and
laid off more than 30,000 public employees this year.

   Negotiations with the Soviet Union to cut
nuclear arsenals, reduce troops and tanks in Europe and banish
chemical weapons are skipping along without rancor and with no more
than healthy suspicions.
   But the issues are so tough that even goodwill and determination
have not cleared away all the roadblocks to quick completion of the
accords.
   President Bush's confident prediction last spring that the NATO
and Warsaw Pact alliances could conclude a treaty in Vienna to
reduce armies and armories in Europe within six months to a year
appears to have been an overstatement.
   Key U.S. government officials attending an arms control seminar
this week on the Eastern Shore of Maryland rated chances of
fulfilling Bush's prediction as slim.
   Speaking on condition their names not be used, they were equally
dubious about quickly wrapping up U.S.-Soviet treaties to sharply
reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines and to
outlaw further production of chemical weapons.
   Bush has excluded arms control as a major topic at his
Mediterranean near-summit next month with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev _ a session being billed as a get-acquainted meeting,
one without a set agenda.
   But the full-dress summit being planned for Washington next
summer could look like a near-even as well if there are no major
arms control accords to sign.
   And yet, a half-dozen well informed officials rated as slim the
prospects for an agreement by summer. It seemed that only
politeness and loyalty kept them from simply saying, ``No way.''
   Both a Conventional Forces in Europe agreement and a Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty were described as no more than ``long-shot''
possibilities by next summer by one key official. He rated the
chances of a chemical weapons pact as even slimmer.
   And yet by Christmas the United States and the Soviet Union plan
to be exchanging information about their chemical arsenals and
production facilities. Inspections probably will start in May.
   The idea is to see that the agreement being negotiated in
Geneva, Switzerland, is not undercut by cheating. That means being
able to detect chemical weapons that can be produced virtually in a
broom closet and which can be carried in a small satchel.
   Verification procedures also are being explored for the
prospective pacts on strategic weapons reductions and on troops,
tanks and artillery in Europe.
   But no one has found a way yet to keep perfect track of cruise
missiles carried aboard submarines and surface vessels.
   The Soviets have agreed to deal with that problem separately,
but that is turning out to be only a procedural shift. The Pentagon
will resist severe restrictions on the sea-based weapons. And the
Soviets, who are far behind in the field, want to curb them.
   When it comes to reducing non-nuclear weapons in Europe, some of
the NATO allies are turning out to be more difficult in some ways
than Moscow. They are not warm to the idea of Soviet inspectors in
their tank plants, for instance.
   The Soviets are described as eager to complete the treaty, if
only to turn their technicians and factories to the production of
consumer goods.
   But they are also trying to retain some 1,000 airplanes that
NATO insists are not entirely for the defense of Soviet territory
and, therefore, subject to limitations.
   And Bush administration officials are already worried that
whatever anti-cheating devices are attached to the three accords
the Senate might decide they are not airtight and block
ratification.

<HEAD>Yazov Condemns Anti-Army Protests; Latvians Ask for Alternative Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, confronted by a
growing movement against the draft, lashed out at ``anti-army
manifestations'' and ruled out change in conscription rules, the
official Tas news agency said Sunday.
   The report came a day after the Latvian Supreme Soviet, in a
move that carried more symbolic than legal force, voted to allow
alternative service to conscientious objectors in the Baltic
republic.
   Tass said Yazov ``condemned anti-army manifestations which
recently spread in some regions of the country _ calls to refuse
service in the army, attempts to evade call-up into the armed
forces, blockade of call-up stations, etc.''
   The Tass report indicated Yazov was not receptive to proposals
from groups in various Soviet republics to allow soldiers to serve
only in their home regions. He said the draft ``would continue to
develop according to the principles of extra-territoriality.''
   Nearly all Soviet men between 18 and 25 years old are required
to serve at least two years in the armed forces. Students were
granted deferments and partial exemptions from service this year,
but Yazov and Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's top military adviser, have made clear there will be no
shift to a volunteer army in the near future.
   The Soviet Union's standing army of about 4 million is about
halfway through a unilateral reduction of 500,000 troops announced
by Gorbachev in December.
   Yazov cited the Baltic region, the Caucasus republics and parts
of Moldavia, where he said anti-draft actions were strongest. All
have strong grassroots movements pushing for more independence from
Moscow.
   In the Caucasus republic of Georgia, more than 200 youths
protesting the draft have been staging sit-ins near government
buildings in recent days, activists said.
   The popular fronts of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are pushing
for their youths to serve only in the Baltics, and a small group of
protesters backing such regional service demonstrated in front of
the Estonian Parliament in Tallinn over the weekend.
   Azerbaijani activists charge that too many of the republic's
youths die in the service, and Latvians and other groups have
similar complaints.
   An empty coffin to symbolize deaths among Latvian soldiers was
brought to the republic's Supreme Soviet parliament during the
weekend debate on the alternative service law for conscientious
objectors, and mothers demonstrated outside the building, said Aris
Jansons, a Latvian newspaper editor.
   Jansons, political editor of the youth paper Padomju Jaunatne,
said a parliamentarian told him an amendment on alternative service
is being prepared in Moscow. But he said it focuses more on service
in construction battalions and other non-combat units.
   Speaking in a telephone interview from Riga, Jansons said the
Latvian measure was essentially ``a gesture'' to make its wishes
known, because the legislative body does not have the authority to
change Soviet military law.
   The presidium of the national Supreme Soviet last week put
Latvia and three other republics that have passed sovereignty laws
on notice that they are expected to bring their laws in line with
national policy and the constitution.

   Rajiv Gandhi, the prime minister, lands
outside a big town, the clatter and windstream of his helicopter's
rotor blades churning up reminders of the power and money he has
pumped into his electoral district.
   Raj Mohan Gandhi, a 54-year-old writer and political novice,
bumps down dirt lanes in a venerable white sedan, telling villagers
barely touched by the 20th century why they should vote for him
instead of the prime minister.
   It's an uphill battle for the challenger, even though he is the
grandson of beloved independence leader Mahatma Gandhi.
   He is unrelated to the prime minister, whose name also evokes
rich pages of Indian history. Rajiv Gandhi is the grandson of Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the son of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi.
   Most people in the Amethi parliamentary district are poor, many
are illiterate, but they know the power of the office of prime
minister. They know that even if Raj Mohan Gandhi defeats Rajiv
Gandhi in this month's election, Raj Mohan will be just another
member of Parliament _ not prime minister.
   Still, there are rumblings of discontent with the government.
Despite an impressive construction boom in towns like Amethi and
Gauriganj since the last elections in 1984, there are villages a
few miles away where people wonder why they do not also have
electricity.
   Across the road from a modern steel plant, farmers wonder why
laborers were imported from other states for jobs they wanted for
their sons.
   In the larger towns, unemployed young men with high school
educations and engineering degrees talk about corruption and an
arms scandal that has dogged the government.
   However, in Jais and Gauriganj, cities of several thousand
people on a narrow but well-maintained blacktop road, it's hard to
believe anyone except the prime minister is running for the seat he
has held since 1981.
   Posters with his portrait are plastered on shops and hang from
lightposts. The orange, white and green colors of his Congress
Party _ also the colors of the Indian national flag _ are festooned
across the streets.
   In a 10-hour drive through the Amethi constituency barely two
weeks before the election that starts Nov. 22 and ends Nov. 26, not
a single portrait of Raj Mohan Gandhi was spotted. The solid green
banners of the Janata Dal party he represents were seldom seen
outside Amethi town.
   Raj Mohan Gandhi has an answer for this.
   In Misrauli, outside Amethi, he tells villagers: ``Each Rajiv
Gandhi poster costs 10 rupees (62 cents). For that, you could feed
your families today.''
   His listeners nod in agreement and say they'll vote for him. He
drives through Khushyal village a few miles away on a bone-jarring
dirt road and doesn't stop. In his wake, though, the inhabitants of
the mud and thatch houses say they too will vote for this tall,
slim, scholarly looking man.
   Susahi Tiwari, a white-bearded man who says he is about 55 but
looks 70, explains: ``The main point is electricity: We have none.
We have given an application, but there is no response.''
   Nearby, women from this village of 50 families inveigh against
the Congress Party, unusual in a region where politics
traditionally are left to men.
   ``Sugar now costs 14 rupees a kilo (38 cents a pound),'' a woman
in a green sari says, waving her forefinger.
   But back in Amethi town, which has a population of about 20,000,
Rajiv Gandhi warns constituents: ``The opposition will hamper the
progress of Amethi.''
   The district has indeed made progress. In 1980, only 330 of the
1,299 bigger villages had electricity. Today, 1,254 have
electricity.
   In 1980, the district had 262 miles of paved roads. Today, it
has 714 miles.
   Not everyone has a job, though.
   In Sarwanpur on the outskirts of Amethi, Mohammad Aftab Akhtar
says he'll vote for Raj Mohan Gandhi and the opposition. ``I am an
engineer, but I can't get a job.''
   His neighbors nod in agreement and when asked why they oppose
Rajiv Gandhi, they burst into a chorus: ``Bofors! Bofors! Bofors!''
   A scandal involving the Swedish arms manufacturer has hounded
Gandhi during the campaign. The Janata Dal's top national leader,
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, and leading Indian newspapers have
challenged the prime minister's assertions that no Indians received
kickbacks in the 1986 contract to buy artillery guns from Bofors.
   Of unemployment, Satish Sharma, Rajiv Gandhi's local point man,
says: ``Every new industry, every project that is set up, they try
to give the highest (job) priority to the land losers, but there
are some categories of people who have no skills.''
   Raj Mohan Gandhi, in an interview as he motored down the road to
yet another remote village, said even if he doesn't defeat the
prime minister, he's sure he'll prevent him from winning by the 84
percent landslide he got five years ago.
   ``Rajiv Gandhi continues in power despite ... corruption that
would have overthrown a government in the democratic world,'' he
said.
   As for running against a member of India's most powerful and
longest lasting political dynasty, Raj Mohan Gandhi says: ``The
fact is, somebody's got to do it, and why not me?''

   Celebrity-seekers trying to catch a
glimpse of Cher on the set at a local high school swimming pool for
a new movie called ``Mermaids'' didn't have much luck.
   Of the group of some two dozen fans armed with everything from
Instamatics to Nikons that held vigil most of the day Saturday,
only one claimed to have made a real sighting.
   Barbara Marabian of Warwick said she saw Cher walk out of one
trailer and knock on the door of another, looking for someone named
Tony.
   There were these other thrills reported: Cher's hand reaching
out of her trailer door for a tray of food; and Cher surrounded by
four crew people so you could ``only see her hair and her shoes,''
according to one witness.
   Early in the afternoon, crew members taped black curtains around
Cher's trailer.
   ``Mermaids,'' said Wallis Nicita, one of the film's producers,
features Cher as ``a promiscuous mother whose daughters are
mortified by her behavior.''

   High-wire artist Rabadan Agaev was
interested in the Firebird _ not the 1910 ballet by his Russian
countryman Igor Stravinsky but in a blue 1985 Pontiac muscle car.
   Agaev bought the Firebird at a used car lot last week during a
break from his work with the Moscow Circus, currently appearing at
the Palace of Auburn Hills as part of a 31-city North American
tour. Their stop here wound up Sunday.
   ``I like American cars most of all, and among them I mostly like
the sports cars,'' said Agaev, 28.
   He wasn't alone. Other members of the troupe have bought a used
Pontiac 6000, a Ford Tempo and a BMW since arriving in this Detroit
suburb.
   Jim Sheridan, whose company is providing security for the circus
and helped them arrange to buy, store and ship the vehicles home,
said he told the performers that cars aren't necessarily cheaper in
the Motor City than other U.S. cities.
   But Sheridan said the Soviets can't resist the U.S. makes that
are bigger, more powerful, better-equipped and much cheaper than
what's available back home.
   ``It's because your cars are marvelous,'' circus director
Gennady Glikin said of the buying spree. ``Not only in the Soviet
Union but all over the world, American cars are an object of
admiration.''

   Gilbert Hill, who directed a few choice oaths at
Eddie Murphy in ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and its sequel, will take an
oath of a different sort when he joins the Detroit City Council in
January.
   Hill, 57, a 32-year veteran of the Detroit Police Department,
was elected last week to a four-year term, drawing the
second-highest number of votes among 18 candidates for nine council
seats.
   He'd investigated more than 4,000 murders before and during his
16 years in the police department's homicide division, the last six
as its commander.
   Hill's star fell shortly after his bit parts as Murphy's
supervisor in ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop II.''
He was transferred in 1987 to his current position as commander of
special services, tending to fingerprint records, confiscated items
and other mundane police matters. He suspected his reassignment was
a bad review of his acting.
   ``You don't volunteer to go to the boondocks,'' he said. ``You
will pay when you try to rise above the crowd.''
   Having made one comeback, Hill hinted that he might try to rise
even further by running for mayor in 1993. He will have to resign
from the police department before joining the council.
   ``If the opportunity arises, if the people are as comfortable
with me as they are now, I would certainly give it a try,'' he said.

   Dolly Parton says asking her if she
likes her latest movie is ``like asking a parent if they think
their kid is pretty.''
   The part of a beautician in ``Steel Magnolias'' was a natural
for her, the country singer and actress told reporters after the
movie's premiere in Natchitoches, the town where it is set.
   ``I thought I could play the part of a country girl with a
Southern accent real good,'' she said.
   Parton, co-star Daryl Hannah and playwright Robert Harling
dressed in pink shirts and blue jeans for a premiere Friday at
Northwestern State University.
   Parton said the city of Natchitoches may have stolen the show.
``You'll be so proud, you'll have the big head,'' she said.
   ``I'm from a small southern city and so I may have related to
the area a little better than some of the others,'' she said.
``It's like coming home to see family. ... I wanted to catch up on
all of the latest gossip.''
   Set in a Southern beauty salon, the film is a a fictionalized
account of the life of Harling's sister Susan, who died from
complications of diabetes.
   ``There are some painful moments in the film, but there is a lot
of humor, too,'' Harling said. ``When I was writing this, I always
had in the back of my mind `Would Susan think this is funny?' I
think of this as a tribute to her.''
   ``I can't begin to describe how I feel when I see it,'' Harling
said. ``The film was able to capture a wonderful place and time.''

<HEAD>Presidential Foundation Asks Sony for $1 Million Library Donation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One year after its ground-breaking, the
Ronald Reagan library has far exceeded its $45 million fund-raising
goal and is still looking for donations including $1 million from
Japan's Sony Corp.
   The latest palatial presidential library, under construction
atop a suburban hillside 45 miles northwest of the city, will also
be the last of such grand proportions thanks to a bill Reagan
signed while president.
   At 153,000 square feet, the Spanish-style Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library will dwarf even the largest of the
presidential museums _ the 100,000-square-foot Lyndon Johnson
shrine in Texas.
   Presidential libraries are built with private funds and
presented as gifts to the United States, which operates the museums
at taxpayer expense. The National Archives and Records
Administration will run the Reagan library with an annual budget of
about $1.5 million.
   The presidential library system, inaugurated by Franklin D.
Roosevelt, costs taxpayers about $16 million a year.
   ``Today's system makes each former president try to outdo his
predecessor and you end up with huge marble pyramids more fitting
as monuments to the pharaohs,'' Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.,
complained when he sponsored a 1986 bill limiting the size of such
libraries.
   It was Reagan who signed the Chiles bill limiting presidential
libraries to a single building of not more than 70,000 feet. His
own was exempted.
   The Reagan foundation refuses to identify donors, many of whom
gave in response to a $2.5 million direct-mail and telemarketing
campaign _ common in presidential library fund raising.
   Foundation records show it with assets of $58 million as of Dec.
31, 1988, the latest figures available, said Sam Williams,
spokesman for the Registry of Charitable Trusts, an arm of the
state Department of Justice.
   However, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg confirmed last week that
the foundation recently asked Japan-based Sony Corp. for a $1
million donation.
   ``Representatives of the foundation have had contact with a
number of American and foreign businesses about donating to the
library and Sony is one of them,'' he said.
   The foundation wants $1 million worth of video equipment to
enhance the library's value as a research center, but Sony
spokesman Tsutomu Sugiyama said a decision hadn't been made.
   ``The Reagans want this to be the best of the presidential
libraries ... state of the art,'' said Weinberg. He said organizers
are seeking funds in excess of the initial $45 million goal so
there will be endowment money to invest and bring income to the
library.
   The former president and his wife, Nancy, were the hosts in
Japan last month of the Fujisankei Communications Group, a Japanese
media company. Reagan was reportedly paid $2 million for that trip,
which included two speeches and attendance at a concert to benefit
the Reagan library.
   The Reagan library, located on a 100-acre site above the Ventura
County bedroom community of Simi Valley, will be the repository for
an expected 62 million papers, exceeding Richard Nixon's record 44
million.
   Set to open in the spring of 1991, the library will include
underground storage, a museum and research materials depicting the
Reagan administration and events during his Washington years.
   Reagan helped break ground Nov. 21, 1988, for the library that
will house his White House papers, saying at the time he hoped
historians and scholars examining his eight-year presidency would
``judge our efforts well.''
   Meanwhile, about 70 miles to the east, the Richard Nixon
Presidential Library is about half-completed on a site in the
Orange County community of Yorba Linda. Dedication is set for June
21, 1990.

   He is unmarried and has no children. He grew
up in a family in which the mother stayed at home. And he is
tantalizingly close to a legislative victory on national child care
legislation.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., perhaps an unlikely candidate to
champion the child care cause, is now closer to his goal than he
has been in the three years since he convened hearings on how
working parents can raise their children.
   A House-Senate conference committee worked into the night just
before the long weekend and agreed on a $1.2 billion bill to
subsidize child care for low-income families. Proponents hope to
send it to President Bush before the Thanksgiving recess.
   Dodd has had to clear some formidable obstacles to get to this
point. Senate Republican leaders said the bill was just another
layer of government interference. Bush said he preferred tax breaks
for poor families rather than subsidies. And conservative
think-tanks even accused Dodd of being against the traditional
family _ the kind he grew up in West Hartford.
   Dodd responds with an admission: ``I'll state it over and over
again. The best child care is parental care.''
   He also has a problem: ``If you could tell me there's some
terrific bill you could introduce to somehow cause mothers and dads
to stay together on one income to take care of everybody, I mean,
I'm all for that. My problem is that's not the real world today.
   ``Now the issue is what happens to that kid if he doesn't have
the alternative I had. And no matter how much I would like him to
have that, that doesn't cut it.''
   The legislation would increase direct federal child care
subsidies to low- and moderate-income families by $1.2 billion in
1990 and by up to $8.5 billion over the next five years. Under the
compromise agreement, more of the money would go to rural areas at
governors' discretion and states could issue vouchers that parents
could use to pay for day care services provided by churches.
   The federal government now allots between $400 million and $1
billion per year in block grants to states for child care
subsidies. The legislation would add $750 million to that pool and
require that states regulate care providers.
   An additional $150 million would go to the Head Start pre-school
program that now reaches about 500,000 3- and 4-year-olds per year
with the aim of turning those facilities into all-day, year-round
child care centers.
   ``All I'm trying to do with this bill is to increase
availability, make it affordable for families that are in the lower
income levels so they can continue to work and be productive
citizens and require that when they leave their infant child with a
virtual stranger, through no fault of their own, that that stranger
ought to meet some minimum health and safety standards,'' Dodd said.
   The conservative Heritage Foundation argues that Dodd is turning
the government into an advocate for one particular, not altogether
preferable, method of raising a family.
   ``Dodd believes that the traditional family where the child is
cared for by parents in their own home is dead, is obsolete,''
Rector said. ``He is accelerating a trend which he admits is not in
the best interest of children.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., called the child care
legislation, ``a classic inside-the-beltway bill. It sounds great.
Who can be against it?''
   But making any real dent in the problem probably would cost $20
billion to $30 billion, says Dole.
   Dodd responds that Dole had neglected to consider what the
legislation might save by providing welfare mothers a way to work
without abandoning their children.
   ``We dish out $16 billion of your tax money every year to keep
these welfare mothers at home,'' Dodd said. ``So the wealthy mother
should go to work but the lower income mother shouldn't?''

<HEAD>Hospitals: Providing Trauma Care To Undocumented Aliens Expensive
Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some had their limbs severed by the wheels of
a train headed north from the Laredo railyards. Others were mangled
in car crashes as they tried to flee the Border Patrol. All were
among the illegal aliens who end up in Buddy Flores' hospital on
the Southwest border.
   Pregnant women from Mexico, who have heard that Mercy Regional
Medical Center in Laredo will not turn them away, show up ready to
deliver a child who will automatically be a U.S. citizen.
   Many have had no prenatal care. Others arrive midway through a
difficult or troubled labor their midwife decided she could not
complete.
   In a city with a large population of legal residents without
insurance or money to pay for medical care, illegal aliens are
draining resources at Flores' Catholic hospital and ``occupying
intensive care beds that are short as it is,'' he says.
   The hospital writes off $20 million a year in bad debts and
charity care, but Flores doesn't know how much is spent on
undocumented aliens. Under Texas law, no patient can be refused
emergency services.
   ``Three years ago, I would have told you this was an occasional
problem (delivering babies from women here illegally),'' Flores
said. ``It's a consistent problem now. If they're in active labor
they know we can't refuse them.''
   Laredo's problems are not unique: Hospitals and trauma units
from San Diego to Miami have been experiencing financial
difficulties treating undocumented aliens, according to border
state lawmakers.
   ``It is not unusual for a border-area hospital to treat a large
number of patients who may be illegally within the U.S. Almost
always the hospital must write off the cost of this medical care
because the patient cannot pay and invariably has no medical
insurance,'' says Rep. Kika de la Garza, a Texas Democrat whose
district borders Mexico.
   De la Garza is cosponsoring the Trauma Care Center Alien
Compensation Act that would provide $20 million a year in grants to
hospitals that incur at least 15 percent of their uncompensated
costs from treating illegal aliens in their trauma units.
   ``The legislation would recognize immigration-related problems
as a federal responsibility not to be shouldered alone by hospital
trauma centers,'' de la Garza said. ``From Los Angeles to Miami,
trauma centers face reimbursement problems that threaten trauma
care for all patients.''
   Cosponsored by Rep. Bill Lowery, a San Diego Republican, the
bill would apply only to trauma patients and would not cover the
problem of illegal aliens delivering their babies in the United
States.
   Lowery acknowledges the severity of the obstetrics problem, but
says something must be done immediately to prevent more trauma
centers from closing their doors because of the impact on the
community.
   Ten trauma centers in Florida and 10 in Los Angeles have already
been forced to close and others are foundering, Lowery said.

   As the euphoria of being elected mayor of New
York City subsides, David Dinkins may feel a four-year hangover
kicking in.
   A series of headaches awaits Dinkins, the first black mayor of
the nation's most populous city. And though they are common to most
cities _ crack, crime, AIDS, the homeless _ they've become nasty
migraines in New York.
   ``I congratulate him and I wish him well, but I don't envy
him,'' former Mayor John Lindsay said the day after Dinkins
defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani. ``New York faces towering
problems and we've got nowhere to turn for help.''
   Lindsay was referring to the underlying problem: money. The
economic boom of the '80s has passed, revenues are slipping and
Albany and Washington have problems of their own.
   Dinkins will be staring at a potential billion-dollar deficit in
his first budget.
   ``He faces enormous problems,'' said outgoing Mayor Edward I.
Koch. ``The question will be, how will he handle the dollars that
are available?''
   Giuliani, in conceding defeat, said, ``Our city is troubled in
deep and serious ways.''
   ``The city's physical facilities are in disarray,'' financier
Felix Rohatyn, who helped rescue the city from its 1970s' fiscal
crisis, said earlier this year. ``Many of our bridges are crumbling
or unsafe; many of our school buildings are a disgrace; and many of
our streets would embarrass a Third World country.''
   Welcome to the 1990s, Mayor Dinkins.
   _ Crack and crime. ``They're inseparable,'' said Thomas
Reppetto, director of the Citizens Crime Commission. And they lead
to clogged courtrooms and overcrowded jails.
   In 1988, New York set records for murders (1,896) and violent
crime (162,916 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults). Forty
percent of the murders were drug related, Reppetto said.
   In 1981, there were 26,000 arrests on drug charges; in 1988,
about 90,000; this year it will be about 110,000, he said.
   _ AIDS. More than 22,000 New Yorkers contracted AIDS; more than
12,000 of them have died. About 200,000 are infected with the AIDS
virus, according to some estimates, though some say the number
could be as high as 360,000.
   ``It's going to be bad,'' said Carisa Cunningham of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis. ``There's a perception that it's slowed down,
but that's not the case.''
   By the end of 1991, there will be 40,000 AIDS cases; by 1993,
60,000, the city Health Department estimates.
   _ Health care. ``We're extremely strained in terms of capacity
and in terms of financial difficulties,'' said Bruce Vladeck,
president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a research group.
   ``That's all hospitals,'' he said, ``though city hospitals are
taking the particular brunt of the epidemics of AIDS and crack and
related illnesses.''
   New York City hospitals, public and private, average more than
90 percent occupancy, he said. The national average is 60 percent.
   Even if a 10-year, $2.1 billion capital plan for city hospitals
went ahead full steam _ which it won't, he said _ ``that will
achieve less than two-thirds of the modernization that, it is
agreed by everyone, is needed.''
   _ The homeless. There are about 74,000 homeless in New York, the
Partnership for the Homeless estimates. The number is growing by
about 7 percent annually, but could skyrocket in hard economic
times.
   ``We did a reasonably decent job of addressing the families in
welfare hotels, but in meantime ignored the mushrooming number of
single adults _ the ones you see on the subways and on the
streets,'' said Peter Smith, partnership president.
   Between 8,000 and 11,000 of the homeless are infected with the
AIDS virus, and that could reach 30,000 by 1993 ``unless something
dramatic is done,'' Smith said. ``Where's he going to get the money
to do it?''
   _ Race relations. Racially motivated killings of blacks have
sent tremors through the city and marches by thousands of blacks
kept the issue in the forefront.
   ``There are signals that people are trying to find their way
through this wilderness,'' said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a civil
rights leader. ``David Dinkins' election is one of those signs.
   ``I'm going to hang up my marching shoes,'' Daughtry said. ``I
may not put them in bronze, but I'll put them up for a while.''
   _ Money. Contracts for nearly all union municipal employees must
be negotiated in the coming year. Each percentage point increase in
pay equals $130 million for the total payroll, said Raymond Horton,
president of the Citizens Budget Committee.
   ``There's a problem, but not a crisis,'' Horton said. ``He can
raise taxes, he can cut expenditures, or he can manage the
resources the city already has more efficiently.
   ``I would tell him to focus as much as possible on
productivity.''
   But Rohatyn says ``it is quite likely that, in retrospect, the
years of the fiscal crisis of '75 to 1980 will appear benign
compared to what New York City is likely to face in the years 1990
to 1995.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Officials Confirm Split in Abu Nidal's Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian officials confirmed Sunday
that some 150 guerrillas have been killed in a 14-month power
struggle among dissidents of Libyan-backed terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
victims included 20 senior officials of the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, which Abu founded in 1973 after he broke away from Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The sources spoke in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, the main
Lebanon power base of guerrillas loyal to Arafat. They said the 20
officials were shot by Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri
el-Banna, or his bodyguards at his home in Tripoli, Libya, and
buried in the backyard.
   Most of the others were killed in various refugee camps in
Lebanon, they said.
   The sources were commenting on reports about the bloody split
published Sunday in The New York Times. The newspaper cited
dissident Fatah-Revolutionary Council leaders, PLO officials and
Arab diplomats for its reports.
   The paper said most of the 20 leaders killed were ``lured into
Abu Nidal's house near Tripoli on the pretext of discussing policy
matters, taken by surprise and killed in the house.
   ``Then they were buried right there. Abu Nidal and his hirelings
poured the cement over their bodies themselves,'' the Times quoted
a dissident it identified as Abdul-Rahman Issa as saying.
   Abu Nidal tops the most wanted lists in the United States and
Europe for several terrorist attacks, including the 1986 bombing of
a synagogue in Istanbul, in which 21 people were killed, and the
1985 attacks at Rome and Vienna airports in which 20 people were
killed and 120 wounded.
   Abu Nidal also was behind the assassination of dozens of
moderate PLO officials who advocated peace with Israel.
   The PLO officials in Ein el-Hilweh said Issa and three other
members of the group's 10-man Politburo, including the spokesman,
Atef Abu Bakr, quit after Abu Nidal murdered Mustafa Murad in
Tripoli on Oct. 17, 1988.
   Murad, better known as Abu Nizar, had been Abu Nidal's closest
aide since the split from the PLO.
   PLO sources had reported a schism in the ranks of Abu Nidal's
group since mid-1987 mainly because of his totalitarian policies
and insistence on maintaining absolute control over finances.
   The group's money came mainly from Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi and from a string of ransom kidnappings staged by Abu
Nidal's men against activists of humanitarian organizations in
south Lebanon in the last three years, according to Abu Bakr and
Issa.
   The two men have issued separate statements from Algiers,
Algeria, in the past few months in which they stressed the group's
financial corruption.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council holds five Belgians and a French
woman hostage. The group said the six were seized Nov. 8, 1987,
aboard a French yacht off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. It
accused them of spying for Israel.
   Two Swiss officials of the International Committee of the Red
Cross were kidnapped in Sidon on Oct. 6. They are believed held at
an Abu Nidal base in Majdalyoun on Sidon's eastern outskirts.
   Abu Nidal's activists also are believed to have kidnapped some
of the other 16 Westerners held in Lebanon and to have sold them to
pro-Iranian Moslem factions.
   Issa and Abu Bakr have said Murad was shot in the presence of
Majed Atta, the husband of Abu Nidal's niece.
   His widow, Subhia Murad, has accused Abu Nidal of shooting her
husband and burying him in a Fatah-Revolutionary Council camp
outside Tripoli, an account The New York Times said was
corroborated by unnamed Arab associates.
   At the camp, Abu Nidal built a new room for his house on top of
the spot where two other senior commanders were buried in concrete
after being killed by him late last year, the Times said.
   Haj Abu Mousa, the group's top military trainer, was lured to
Abu Nidal's house earlier in 1988 and killed in the same manner.
   The reports said the Tripoli killings touched off a campaign of
assassinations among the rival wings of the groups in which some
130 people have been killed in south Lebanon and in the northern
camps of Baddawi and Nahr el-Bared in the last three months.
   They said Abu Nidal has suspended the group's Politburo and
transferred its powers to the 50-man Central Committee after
appointing Atta as its second secretary. Abu Nidal is the first
secretary, they added.

   The opening of the Berlin Wall has brought joy
to the public but poses problems for U.S. defense planners trying
to maintain the military balance in Europe, experts say.
   ``There's so much euphoria, people will tend to think it's all
over,'' said Raymond L. Garthoff of the Brookings Institution.
   ``We need some sort of policy ... to preserve the military
balance in Europe,'' said Robert Lieber, a government professor at
Georgetown University. He urged a force cut on both sides, along
the lines of the conventional force reduction talks underway in
Vienna.
   Rapid change in East Germany underscores the need for stability
in Central Europe, the flashpoint for two world wars in this
century, said Garthoff and Lieber, echoing a view widely held among
defense officials.
   ``From 1871 to 1945 the politics of Europe were highly
unstable,'' and the main problem was a very powerful Germany, said
Lieber.
   U.S. officials face the followng questions, the experts said:
   _How to react to a possible reunification of East and West
Germany for the first time since the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.
   _Whether West Germany will be able to accommodate East German
refugees. An estimated 200,000 already have arrived in the West
this year.
   _How to encourage other East European countries to move toward
democracy and free-market economies.
   The pace of change appeared to be speeding up rather than
slowing down, with the resignation on Friday of Bulgarian communist
leader Todor Zhivkov after 35 years in power, indicating a shift
toward reform there.
   That would leave Czechoslovakia and Romania as the only two
members of the Warsaw Pact yet to start reforms.
   ``I suspect there will be some move fairly soon in
Czechoslovakia, too,'' leaving Romania even more isolated, said
Garthoff, who was U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria from 1977 to 1979. He
said he didn't expect changes in Romania as long President Nicolae
Ceausescu retains a strong hand.
   The European balance could be tipped by a unilateral Western
reduction in forces that leaves the Soviet Union dominant in the
region, or a decision by East Germany to unite with West Germany
and withdraw from the Warsaw Pact.
   Despite a unilateral Soviet troop reduction in Eastern Europe
announced last year, Western government officials say the Soviets
have superior conventional forces in Europe.
   Soviet experts, however, claim there is a rough equivalence when
sophisticated Western aircraft and other weapons are included.
   President Bush and his top advisers have insisted that caution
is the wisest policy in the face of rapid change in Eastern Europe.
   ``The best way to keep America and the West free is to keep
ourselves strong,'' Bush said in a speech last Friday.
   Bush also promised to ``seize every chance'' to encourage
democracy in Eastern Europe, but he and his top aides say that
despite Soviet Bloc claims that reform is permanent, hard-liners
could return.
   ``I don't think it's going to be reversible, but it may be,''
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said PBS-TV's
``MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.'' ``That's why we must continue to
maintain our strength, our will.''
   The prospect of German reunification arouses great concern among
U.S. and Western European defense officials.
   ``The major pitfall is whether or not we do find that events
lead us the to reunification of Germany,'' said retired General
Bernard Rogers, the former NATO commander.
   East German Ambassador Gerhard Herder told a news conference he
could dream of German reunification, but not in the foreseeable
future.
   The main obstacle, he said, is that East and West Germany are
``integrated into military alliances guaranteeing a stable balance
of power'' in Europe.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students and
labor activists fought riot police Sunday with firebombs and rocks
in the country's three largest cities.
   Police said they arrested about 600 people in Seoul but had no
figure on injuries.
   The street battles in Seoul followed a two-hour rally, in which
3,000 radical students and labor activists called for the overthrow
of the Roh government and revision of laws they argue restrict
labor movements.
   The protesters staged the rally at the state-run Seoul National
University in southern Seoul after authorities banned their
gathering at a public park. During the rally, they vowed to fight
for a ``victory of the 10 million workers'' in South Korea.
   ``We will overcome whatever difficulties and win back our just
rights,'' Dan Byong-ho, chief organizer of the rally said as
followers cheered.
   Dan, head of a newly organized dissident labor organization, the
National Federation of Labor Unions, accused the Roh government of
suppressing labor movements as part of its effort to hold onto
power.
   Dan said his group's aim is to fight only for higher salaries
and better working conditions but authorities said they suspect the
group is led by pro-North Korean elements. Officials said the labor
rally Sunday could pose a threat to social order.
   Fierce street battles broke out near Shinsegye Department Store
and East Gate in downtown Seoul where 300 to 500 protesters fought
police for several hours with rocks and firebombs in a dense fog of
tear gas.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters shouted as they charged
police with rocks and firebombs.
   Armored police vans fired volleys of tear gas to disperse the
protesters, who regrouped in alleys and charged back repeatedly.
Some demonstrators were caught and beaten up by police.
   About 3,000 police were deployed in Seoul to protect key
government offices and public installations.
   Shoppers and pedestrians covered their faces with handkerchiefs
to beat back the acrid tear gas. Streets were littered with rocks
and fragments from tear gas canisters.
   In Pusan, the nation's second largest city on the south coast,
about 500 students, workers and dissident school teachers clashed
with police after a rally, during which they denounced the
government for backing away from its promise for democratic reforms.
   Police fired tear gas when the protesters, hurling rocks and
firebombs, tried to march into the streets.
   The Pusan rally was organized by dissident middle and high
school teachers who were fired or reprimanded by the government for
involvement in an outlawed teachers' union.
   In Taegu, the nation's third-largest city, police also fired
tear gas to stop some 300 radical students, workers and dissident
school teachers from staging street demonstrations.
   There were no reports of arrests or injuries in the protests in
the two provincial cities.

   The Iranian-backed group Hezbollah
celebrated the slayings of hundreds of Americans, French and
Israelis with a military parade Sunday that displayed 50 fighters
groomed to carry out more suicide bombings.
   About 800 Hezbollah activists took part in the three-hour parade
in Bir el-Abed, a Shiite Moslem slum in south Beirut.
   ``You are the future of our nation,'' Hezbollah's senior
cleargymen, Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, said in a speech. ``Our hopes are
pinned on you.''
   Another clergyman, Ghassan Ghibris, said: ``We pledge to remain
the dagger we stab into their veins, the sword that pierces their
hearts, the time bomb that blows them up and the mine they dare not
step upon because it will kill them all.''
   Thousands of wild-eyed Hezbollahis, waving clenched fists,
responded with tumultuous cries of ``death to America ... death to
Israel.''
   They also raised banners that read: ``We are at your disposal,
Oh Khomeini,'' renewing allegiance to the founder of Iran's Islamic
Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.
   The rally was called to mark the 7th anniversary of a suicide
truck bombing of Israel's military headquarters in the southern
port city of Tyre.
   The attack on Nov. 11, 1982, five months after Israel invaded
Lebanon, killed 75 people, most of them Israeli soldiers. Ahmed
Kassir, the truck driver who perished in the blast, is hailed by
Hezbollah as its first suicide bomber.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, was trained by Iranian Revolutionary
Guards who had come to Lebanon to help fight the invading Israelis.
   Hezbollah now comprises about 4,000 members, backed by up to
2,000 Revolutionary Guards still entrenched in east Lebanon.
   The parade was held a block away from Hay Madi, another Shiite
slum where most of the 18 Western hostages are believed to be held.
Hezbollah is the umbrella for the Shiite extremists holding most of
them.
   At least 10 other suicide bombings were claimed by Hezbollah or
underground factions affiliated with it after the attack in Tyre.
   The bloodiest were the simultaneous bombings of the U.S. Marine
base and the headquarters of French paratroopers in Beirut on Oct.
23, 1983. These killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French
paratroopers who were part of a multi-national peacekeeping force.
   Islamic Jihad, or holy war, which claimed responsibility for the
truck bombings, now holds at least two of eight American hostages.
They are Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Islamic Jihad also claimed responsibility for the suicide
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, in which 62
people were killed. A similar attack on the embassy annex in Aukar,
north of Beirut, on Sept. 20, 1984, killed 12 people.
   A group of 50 bearded men, stamping their feet and crying
``We're marching to martyrdom!'' filed past the platform, where the
turbaned clergymen were seated.
   A commentator, speaking through a loudspeaker, said they were
``trained suicide bombers.'' Hezbollah militiamen banned
photographers from taking pictures of this particular group.
   Hezbollah members paraded various weapons, including 106mm
recoilless guns, shoulder-fired armor-piercing rockets, 155mm
howitzers and armored personnel carriers.
   Paratroopers with parachutes strapped to their backs and
militiamen in green anti-gas outfits followed. Hezbollah officials
said the anti-gas suits were made in Iran.
   A group of teen-agers in track suits were next. The commentator
introduced them as the ``athletes whom Khomeini loved.'' They
chanted: ``We are at your disposal, oh Khomeini.''
   They carried coffins to symbolize their preparedness to die.
   Life-size portraits of Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, flanked by Iranian flags, decorated the field. Pictures
of five suicide bombers were propped against the platform along
with six paintings depicting suicide operations.
   A poster showed a red rose, its stem rising from a pool of blood
carved in the middle of the American flag.
   The star of the parade was 3-year-old Ali Tofaili, a relative of
Sobhi Tofaili, one of the militia's leaders.
   The boy was dressed in camouflage fatigues and carried a toy gun
in one hand and an Iranian flag in the other.
   When asked what he was carrying, he looked at the two objects
and muttered ``I don't know.''

<HEAD>Moldavian Activists Gather Signatures for Leadership to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists in the Moldavian capital of Kishinev
canceled a rally planned for Sunday and instead circulated
petitions calling for the local leadership to resign, members of
the southwestern republic's People's Front said.
   People's Front leader Ion Hadyrka spurred the petition drive
with a speech on Moldavian television Saturday night, demanding
removal of conservatives in the top government echelons.
   Hadyrka also denied the People's Front was to blame for a brawl
Friday between police and protesters that left nearly 200 injured,
Natalia Pascal, the group's spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview.
   Conflicting accounts of the clash aggravated a growing
confrontation between local government leaders and the People's
Front, a group formed last year to press for the rights of ethnic
Moldavians in the republic of 4.2 million that borders Romania.
   The republic's Communist Party Politburo charged that the
People's Front was a ``serious destabilizing factor which
aggravates the situation in Soviet Moldavia,'' and it accused the
group's supporters of ``joining in an open struggle to topple the
legitimate government.''
   People's Front members say they tried to stop the clash.
   Friday's injury count was raised from 83 police to 142, said
Fyodor Angeli, director of the Moldavian news agency, ATEM, in a
telephone interview from Kishinev. Forty-six protesters were also
reported injured and four of the police were in critical condition,
he said.
   More than 15,000 security troops were brought in by bus and
plane to Kishinev and armored personnel carriers could be seen on
the city's outskirts, Ms. Pascal said.
   Trouble in Kishinev began Nov. 7, the day marking the 1917
Bolshevik revolution that brought Communists to power. Protesters
blocked the military part of the traditional parade, and a People's
Front spokesman charged that police beat many would-be protesters.
   On Friday night, a crowd of several thousand gathered outside
the Interior Ministry headquarters in downtown Kishinev demanding
the release of about 20 people arrested Nov. 7. The crowd threw
stones and gasoline bombs at police, who responded with truncheons
and water cannons. Police finally used tear gas and fired into the
air to break up the crowd.

   A strong earthquake rolled through the
eastern Aegean islands early Sunday, but police said no injuries or
significant damage were reported.
   The tremor, measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale, was felt mostly
near Chios' northern coast, said police.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake struck at 6:50
a.m. with its epicenter in the Aegean seabed 138 miles northeast of
the capital.
   The Richter scale is a guage of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.

   Six years after escaping Vietnam
aboard a 30-foot, wooden fishing boat, Son-Binh Nguyen made a
research discovery as a summer intern at DuPont that could improve
the way nylon is made.
   DuPont rewarded Nguyen last month with its Achievement Award,
the first college undergraduate ever to receive the honor from the
Delaware-based chemical giant's research and development department.
   Nguyen, a 20-year-old Penn State University senior majoring in
chemistry and physics, plays down his research efforts.
   ``It's luck as far as I'm concerned,'' he said recently.
   The 20-year-old's findings could potentially improve the way
chemicals used in manufacturing nylon are prepared and save the
company millions of dollars, said Ronald McKinney, Nguyen's
supervisor at DuPont.
   ``Son-Binh identified a problem that the company may not have
fully appreciated before and he also came up with a possible
solution,'' McKinney said.
   ``Whether that solution ends up being something used in the
plant is not clear yet. But it certainly is under serious
consideration. I think it looks very promising,'' he said.
   After several unsuccessful attempts to escape, Nguyen made it
out of Vietnam with about 20 others in March 1983 aboard his
uncle's boat bound for Malaysia. His parents were left behind.
   ``When I escaped, I don't even know if I live or not,'' said
Nguyen. ``A small boat in a big ocean, pirates, the government
coast guard. It very likely I might die.''
   They were rescued three days later. The group spent 13 months in
refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines before being allowed
into the United States.
   Nguyen and his brother Tran-Son, now 18, went to an aunt and
uncle already living in Williamsport.
   Although he didn't speak English very well, Nguyen was placed in
the regular curriculum at Williamsport High School.
   He got two jobs after school working from 2:30 p.m. until
midnight.
   ``He's an exceptionally talented, dedicated student,'' said Mary
Bennardi, who taught Nguyen English at Williamsport High School.
   At Penn State, Nguyen spends 20 to 25 hours a week in the
chemistry laboratory and takes eight or nine courses a semester.
   ``The work is exciting,'' he said.
   Nguyen is ``one of the hardest working students I've ever met,''
said Gregory Geoffroy, a chemistry professor who is dean of the
College of Science.
   Nguyen wants to do advanced studies in chemistry when he
graduates in May.
   He also expects to become a U.S. citizen next spring and is
trying to get his parents, another brother and two adoptive sisters
from Vietnam. The U.S. government has approved, but the Vietnamese
government has not.
   Nguyen's mother and father were doctors when North Vietnam's
communist government completed its takeover of South Vietnam in
1975.
   They now grow coconuts in Chogao, a farm village 70 miles south
of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   ``We don't have any future there,'' Nguyen said. ``We never
really get along with the communists and the way the communists
treat the people.''
   Nguyen said he is grateful for the help he has received in the
United States.
   ``Because of all of the people who have given me scholarships,
help and support for the last five years,'' he said. ``I should not
do anything that will disappoint them.''

<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World War II Allies still have an official
grip on Berlin, but there was little evidence of that during a
tumultuous weekend of wild celebrations.
   No one asked permission from the United States, the Soviet
Union, England or France to punch holes through border barriers,
although security and sovereignty are strictly the affair of the
occupying forces.
   Likewise, the exclusive Allied matter of access to the city was
ignored during the emotional exchange that brought hundreds of
thousands of East Germans to West Berlin.
   Reflecting the upset of order inflicted by the crumbling
borders, U.S. Army Sgt. Terry Ramsey said his unit had suspended
patrolling of the Berlin Wall, where the watchposts were empty.
   ``There's no reason to go because we gather information about
the guards and the towers,'' said Ramsey, who has been stationed in
Berlin for three years. ``There's no one there. So there's no
purpose in the wall patrol.''
   But the four-power control does have effects _ for example,
forcing a wide detour in what would have been a short flight for
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl from Warsaw to Berlin last week.
   And the Allies would legally have final say over the
reunification of Berlin.
   Under the Potsdam agreement of 1945, the four victorious powers
of World War II parceled out defeated Nazi Germany and the capital,
Berlin, for occupation.
   Sovereignty was granted to the new West German state created out
of the French, British and American occupation zones in 1949, and
the Soviets followed by setting up the Communist state of East
Germany in the remaining zone.
   Berlin has remained under Allied jurisdiction.
   Day-to-day administration of the Western sectors was deeded to a
West Berlin government, and the Soviets gradually relinquished East
Berlin to the installed Communist leadership.
   U.S. Mission spokesman Anthony Sariti explained that the powers
officially remaining with the Allies are over security, access and
provision of services and facilities for the occupying forces.
   The controls define air corridors into the city that limit
commercial aviation access to carriers from France, Britain and the
United States, and highway access is also officially monitored by
the foreign forces.
   That cumbersome air corridor stipulation forced Kohl to detour
through Hamburg on Friday when he flew from the Polish capital of
Warsaw to Berlin. It also prevents the West German national
carrier, Lufthansa, from flying into one of the nation's most
important cities.

<HEAD>Police Deny Arrest Made in Shooting of Pregnant Woman and Husband</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police on Sunday denied published reports that
they had arrested a key suspect in last month's shooting of a
pregnant woman and her husband.
   William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where the
shootings occurred, was arrested at his girlfriend's home in
suburban Burlington on a traffic violation, Burlington police said
Saturday.
   The Boston Sunday Herald cited unidentified police sources as
saying Bennett was a chief suspect in the shooting that killed
attorney Carol Stuart and her baby and wounded her husband, Charles
Stuart.
   The Boston Sunday Globe also reported that unidentified sources
familiar with the case said police were focusing on Bennett as a
suspect.
   But Joseph Dunford, deputy chief of detectives for Boston
Police, released a statement Sunday saying no arrest had been made
in the Stuart case and declining comment on the Herald article.
   Dunford could not be reached immediately by telephone.
   Pauline Bennett, the mother of the arrested man, said her son
was a suspect in the shooting that drew nationwide attention to
Boston's flaring crime problems.
   ``They say he's a suspect,'' she said. ``He's been in trouble
before. He knew he was a suspect. He was nervous and upset about
it.''
   Burlington police said they had cooperated with Boston police on
Bennett's arrest, and they referred all questions about the
shooting to Boston police.
   ``It was a routine arrest on a traffic warrant,'' Lt. Arnold
Christiansen said. ``We don't have any information related to'' the
Stuart shootings, he said.
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, died after she was shot in the head by a man
who abducted the couple as they were leaving Brigham and Womens'
Hospital, where they had attended a birthing class.
   The infant, Christopher, was delivered by Caesarean section and
clung to life for more than two weeks before succumbing to a
respiratory ailment Thursday. The medical examiner ruled his death
a homicide.
   Charles Stuart, 29, was listed in guarded condition after having
surgery Saturday at Boston City Hospital. Hospital officals would
not give a reason for the surgery.
   Bennett has served separate prison terms for shooting two police
officers, the Sunday Herald reported.
   Charles Stuart told police his assailant shot him because he
thought Stuart was a police officer after seeing Stuart's cellular
car phone.
   Bennett's girlfriend, Faye Nelson, told the Sun of Lowell in a
telephone interview that Bennett was with her when the shootings
occurred.
   ``He didn't do it,'' Nelson said.

   Dame Joan Sutherland bid farewell to the American
opera stage, telling fans she wanted to leave ``a pleasant sound in
your ears.''
   The 63-year-old prima donna's last U.S. performance, in the
title role of ``The Merry Widow,'' was capped by a tribute from
President Bush.
   ``Dame Joan's coloratura soprano echos in the minds of all who
have been privileged to hear her sing,'' Bush wrote in a tribute
presented Saturday to Miss Sutherland on the same stage where she
made her American debut 29 years ago.
   Miss Sutherland clasped her hand to her heart at Bush's words,
then thanked her American fans for their attention over the course
of her stage career, one of the longest and most illustrious in
opera.
   ``I can never forget the wonder of it all when I came to the
U.S., and how pleasant, how wonderful you've all been,'' Miss
Sutherland said.
   She has scheduled only two more opera performances, in ``Die
Fledermaus'' at London's Royal Opera and ``Les Huguenots'' in her
native Australia.
   She plans to continue giving concerts, but said the time had
come to depart the opera stage.
   ``I'd rather leave you with a pleasant sound in your ears than
start croaking too much,'' she said.
   Miss Sutherland said she is retiring so she can spend more time
at her home and garden in Switzerland and with her family. She also
has said it is time for younger singers to get the applause.
   ``I get a little embarrassed now to think that I am the age I am
and still taking up space that could go to a younger person,'' she
said in the recent interview. ``The time has come when it is better
that I am in the audience rather than on the stage.''

   Vladimir Ashkenazy was cheered Sunday at the
Moscow academy where he once studied as he conducted Britain's
Royal Philharmonic orchestra in the return to his homeland he had
not seen for 26 years.
   Shouts of ``Bravo! Bravo!'' rang through the Grand Hall of the
Moscow Conservatory as the orchestra finished a program that
included works by Russian composers Mussorgsky, Rachmaninov and
Tchaikovsky.
   Ashkenazy, a student at the conservatory when he shared the top
prize in the 1962 Tchaikovsky piano competition, beamed and joined
briefly in the crowd's rhythmic applause.
   The program was the second of two charity concerts by Ashkenazy
and the Royal Philharmonic. Proceeds will help restore cultural
monuments destroyed in last December's earthquake in the southern
Soviet republic of Armenia. About 25,000 people were killed by the
quake.
   Ashkenazy is one of many Soviet artists who left or were
expelled from their native land but have returned to perform in the
freer climate permitted by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   After his performance in the 1962 Tchaikovsky competition,
Ashkenazy left for a concert tour of Britain and announced in April
1963 that he intended to stay abroad. He returned briefly to Moscow
but left again later in 1963.
   Another famous pianist, Vladimir Horowitz, returned in 1986
after a 61-year absence. When Horowitz died Nov. 5 in New York he
was eulogized by the Soviet Union as an artist whose talent
belonged to the world.
   Ashkenazy put aside his conductor's baton during the first
concert Saturday to play the piano as the Royal Philharmonic
performed Beethoven's Concerto No. 3 for Piano and Orchestra.
   On Sunday, Soviet pianist Andrei Gavrilov, who won the
Tchaikovsky competition 14 years after Ashkenazy, performed as the
orchestra played Rachmaninov's Second Concerto.
   Dozens of people gathered outside the conservatory, one of the
most prestigious concert halls in Moscow, hoping to be able to
purchase a ticket. Tickets sold for up to $19, a large sum compared
to average concert prices in the Soviet Union.
   Soldiers behind metal barricades checked tickets twice before
concert-goers were able to enter the hall, and the tickets were
checked several more times inside.
   Listeners broke into applause when they recognized the first
notes from Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker Suite,'' the orchestra's
single encore, and were still applauding when the conductor and
orchestra left the stage after several curtain calls.

<HEAD>Dolores Ibarrui, `La Pasionaria,' Whose Cry Spurred a Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Dolores Ibarruri, nicknamed ``La Pasionaria,'' spurred besieged
anti-fascist fighters in the Spanish Civil War with oratory that
led to her exile and earned the hatred of triumphant Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   The Communist leader's fiery exhortation to Republican forces in
the 1936-39 civil war _ ``No Pasaran!'' or ``They Shall Not Pass!''
_ became a battle cry and inspired worldwide forces against fascism.
   Many literary scholars believe she was the model for Pilar, the
energetic heroine of Ernest Hemingway's novel of the war, ``For
Whom the Bell Tolls.''
   Ms. Ibarruri died Sunday in the Ramon y Cajal hospital in Madrid
of pneumonia. She was 93.
   Though her forces were defeated by Franco, she outlived the
Spanish dictator and ended a 38-year exile in the Soviet Union by
returning in triumph in 1977.
   In the first democratic elections since Franco set off the
bloody three-year civil war, the 82-year-old honorary Communist
Party president won back the Parliament seat she had held four
decades earlier. She later gave it up because of her age.
   On Dec. 9, 1985, figures from the international Communist
movement _ and from Spain's socialist government _ feted La
Pasionaria on her 90th birthday.
   ``The name of La Pasionaria sums up an entire era in the
struggle of workers and the Spanish people for freedom, democracy
and progress,'' Cuban President Fidel Castro wrote in an article
published for the celebration.
   Born Dec. 9, 1895, into a Roman Catholic mining family in
Gallarta in the Basque province of Vizcaya, Dolores Ibarruri was
the eighth of 11 children.
   In her autobiography ``The Way,'' Mrs. Ibarruri wrote she had
``an unhappy childhood and an adolescence without hope'' and said
the harsh conditions in which her family lived turned her into a
revolutionary.
   ``I knew the terrible pain of days without bread and winters
without fire.''
   Her family was too poor to pay for schooling so she abandoned
her ambition of becoming a teacher. She married Julian Ruiz, a
socialist activist five years her senior. Ruiz, who claimed he
guided La Pasionaria politically, once recalled her as being as
independent as a mountain goat.
   Separated from his wife since the 1930s, Ruiz died a few weeks
after her return to Spain from Moscow.
   Mrs. Ibarruri wrote that she found married life ``odious and
unbearable.'' Four of her six children died in infancy, including
triplets born in 1923.
   Ruiz was often jailed for labor agitation and unable to feed
their two remaining children _ a son, Ruben, who died in the battle
of Stalingrad, and a daughter, Amaya, the sole surviving child.
   Dolores Ibarruri turned to politics after Ruiz introduced her to
socialism and Marxism. She read about the Russian revolution. ``Two
names,'' she wrote later, ``struck me in my heart and in my head _
Russia and Lenin. I no longer felt sad, I no longer felt alone.''
   She began a career as a labor organizer and strike leader and
wrote articles she signed as ``La Pasionaria,'' a name she chose in
1916 because her first article appeared during Holy Week, known in
Spanish as the week of the Passion.
   In 1934, she led a rebellion by 40,000 miners in the northern
province of Asturias.
   Soviet Communism became La Pasionaria's religion. She visited
Moscow in 1933 and 1935, when she was elected deputy to the
Parliament from the town of Oviedo.
   When the civil war broke out in July 1936 she sent her surviving
children to the Soviet Union, remaining in Madrid to lead rallies,
visit Republican forces and make her ringing radio broadcasts.
   Her ability to recruit fighters was so strong that her enemies
often claimed she was being guided directly by Moscow.
   With Franco's victory imminent, La Pasionaria fled to the Soviet
Union in 1939 where she was named secretary-general of the Spanish
Communist Party in exile in 1942. She became president in 1954.
   Although she was always present at Communist Party meetings,
Mrs. Ibarruri remained in the background and rarely spoke in public.
   She saw the once powerful Spanish Communist Party, which she
helped found in 1920, split into factions and become a minor
political force under the constitutional monarchy of King Juan
Carlos.
   She witnessed the transformation of the party's move away from
Moscow without saying a word. But she always remained an
unshakeable supporter of the Soviets, who gave her the Order of
Lenin, one of the Soviet Union's most prestigious honors.
   In later years, her vibrant voice and energy were gone, but she
kept her habit of dressing in black.
   ``Why have I always dressed in black?'' Mrs. Ibarruri said in a
rare interview. ``A woman of humble background like me can't wear
bright clothes. With a black dress, although it may be inexpensive,
one can go anywhere and one goes more decently.''

<HEAD>Pope Canonizes Czechoslovak Nun, Polish Friar in First TV Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II canonized Princess Agnes
of Bohemia, a medieval Czechoslovak nun, on Sunday in the first
papal ceremony broadcast on state television in the Communist
nation.
   The pontiff also formally conferred sainthood on a Polish friar,
Adam Chmielowski.
   More than 9,000 Czechoslovaks, including a government
delegation, packed St. Peter's Basilica to watch the canonization
of the princess who turned nun and laid a framework for social work
in 13th century Bohemia _ a region that became modern
Czechoslovakia.
   The pilgrims paid $300 each for the four-day trip to Rome.
   The live, hour-long broadcast and the unprecedented move of
granting travel visas to Czechoslovak pilgrims reflected a marked
improvement in relations between Prague and the Holy See in recent
months.
   The decision to broadcast the ceremony appeared to be in line
with an official effort to prevent Catholic dissent at a time when
Czechoslovakia's orthodox Communist leaders are becoming
increasingly isolated from shifts toward democracy in other eastern
European countries.
   During the ceremony, the Polish-born pontiff praised Agnes for
her ``Christian faith and heroic charity.''
   Agnes rejected efforts by her parents _ King Premysl Otakar I
and Queen Constance _ to arrange her a royal wedding. Instead she
became a nun in 1234 and established religious hospitals and the
Convent of the Poor Sisters, where she died in 1282.
   John Paul told the crowd they should learn from Agnes' example
of helping others without complaint.
   ``Human history is in continuous movement; times change with the
different generations and with scientific discoveries; new
techniques but also new worries arise on the horizon of human
beings, who are always traveling; but the truth of Christ, who
illuminates and saves, survives the changing events,'' said the
gold-robed pontiff.
   He did not refer specifically to the rapid push toward democracy
in Eastern Europe over recent months or to Czechoslovakia's failure
to embrace the shift.
   But there has been a thaw in the Vatican's relations with the
Soviet bloc and, after years of bitterness and contention, Prague
agreed to the appointment of four new bishops this year.
   However, seven out of thirteen diocese in Czechoslovakia are
still vacant.
   Also canonized Sunday was Chmielowski, known as ``Brother
Albert.'' He was a 19th century painter of religious themes who
founded hostels for the poor and homeless. He became a Franciscan
friar and established a congregation of friars.
   He helped found 21 religious houses before dying in 1916.

<HEAD>Mubarak Calls For Measures To Combat Trade Gap, Unemployment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak called for measures
to combat a trade gap, unemployment and sluggish productivity among
government-owned industries, but he rejected calls to sell off
companies to the private sector.
   In a nationally broadcast policy speech Saturday marking the
inauguration of a new session of the People's Assembly, Mubarak
devoted most of his 90-minute speech to the economy and how to
enact reform.
   For months, Egyptian officials have been discussing the need to
dismantle part of the public sector, whose factories range from
producing iron and steel to clothes. Mubarak called for freer
management of government-owned industries but he refused to
consider privatization.
   ``The freeing of the public sector is a pure Egyptian necessity
for the interest of the national economy,'' he said. ``The issue is
not selling the public sector or changing its ownership, but the
issue is supporting it and increasing its capability so that it
will produce more.''
   The president said the nation needed to narrow its $4.5 billion
gap between foreign exchange and spending on imports by increasing
production and modernizing the industrial and agricultural sectors.
   ``Continuation of this gap would have dire consequences,
touching the country and all citizens,'' Mubarak told the 458-seat
house where his National Democratic Party holds an overwhelming
majority.
   Mubarak ruled out using foreign loans to bridge the gap. The
country's foreign debt totals about $44 billion.
   Mubarak indicated private business must help in tackling
unemployment. Official figures show about 2 million university
graduates and laborers are without jobs.
   ``We put the unemployment problem at the top of our priorities
because we understand the importance of opening new productive job
opportunities ... but the government cannot face this problem
alone,'' Mubarak said.
   Mubarak, who took office eight years ago, inherited most of the
country's economic woes from late President Anwar Sadat's open-door
policy and late President Gamal Abdel Nasser's socialist regime.
   Roughly one-fourth of Egypt's foreign debt is owed to the United
States. Under pressure from the U.S.-dominated International
Monetary Fund, Cairo began economic changes in 1987 that included
increasing exports, reducing imports and fusing several foreign
exchange rates into a single, more realistic one.
   The reforms enabled Egypt, with IMF help, to reschedule debts of
about $8 billion. Talks are under way with the fund on further
changes to permit rescheduling $5 billion in other loans.

husband and wife team of federal appellate judges.
   Sheldon Jay Plager and Irene H. Nagel say as nearly as they can
tell, they made U.S. judicial history when Plager, an Indiana
University law school professor, was sworn in Saturday as a member
of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. Nagel has served as a
member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission since 1985.
   Plager said he hasn't conducted his own research on whether they
are unique, but: ``I suspect it's true,'' he said.
   Plager was sworn in Saturday night in a ceremony at his
Bloomington home.
   Plager, 58, was dean of the Indiana University Law School until
1984. Since then he has taught part-time in his specialties of
environmental, property and administrative law.
   Nagel has been on the law school faculty since 1973, teaching
criminal law. She has taught part time since her federal
appointment.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's president on Sunday urged Western
nations to help East Germany recover from the exodus of its
citizens, and the mayors of East and West Berlin shook hands in no
man's land to usher in a new era of relations.
   East Germany's Communist Party leader called for an emergency
party congress and indicated a new slate of leaders will be
installed to replace the Old Guard and institute reforms in his
changing nation.
   Another hole was cut through the Berlin Wall to the roaring
cheers of spectators. East Berliners continued to flood the western
half of the city, buying all they could afford with their $55 of
government ``welcome money.''
   By Sunday afternoon, Burger King was out of beer and Haagen-Daz
had sold all its ice cream bars.
   Unlike thousands who abandoned their Communist homeland for the
West in recent weeks, most people crossing on the weekend were just
visiting, taking advantage of the freedom created by the opening
Thursday of East Germany's borders. By Sunday night, the border
gridlock had eased, and West Berlin's streets were returning to
normal.
   Reflecting the new open-border policy, East German Defense
Minister Heinz Kessler said Sunday that border guards, who once
shot at their fleeing countrymen, have been told not to use
firearms any more in cases of border violations.
   But amid the euphoria, there were reminders of the political
changes and uncertainty still sweeping through East Germany, which
began carving passages through the 29-mile-long Berlin Wall on
Friday.
   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz called for an emergency party
congress next month, the official ADN news agency said. He
indicated a new Central Committee will be elected to carry out
various reforms aimed at stopping East Germans from going West.
   ``We need a Central Committee that can carry the full
responsibility and enjoys full trust,'' Krenz was quoted as telling
reporters.
   Krenz said the current Central Committee would meet Monday to
approve holding the congress. Also Monday, East Germany's
Parliament is to meet to name a Cabinet to replace the one that
resigned Tuesday. The reform-minded party chief of Dresden, Hans
Modrow, was expected to be named premier.
   Since Krenz replaced hard-liner Erich Honecker as party chief
Oct. 18, 10 full members of the ruling 21-member Politburo have
lost their positions. There also has been pressure for the
163-member policy-setting Central Committee, chosen under Honecker,
to resign.
   On West Berlin's fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue, about 1,000
leftists marched through the streets shouting slogans against
German reunification.
   An appeal signed by the official Free German Youth movement and
representatives of the democratic opposition voiced fears about
``the very existence of our country'' in the wake of the massive
westward stream of visitors.
   More than 3 million East Germans headed West over the weekend,
while several hundred thousand people made their way to Berlin from
other countries to join a 4-day-old celebration.
   ``The wall will never be what it used to be. It remains a
memorial to inhumanity,'' West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker said in a speech in West Berlin's
Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedaechtnis Church. The church, a landmark to World
War II destruction, combines the bombed-out ruins of the old
Kaiser-Wilhelm church with a modern structure.
   ``Winter is at the door, the ailing have to be taken care of,''
von Weizsaecker said, alluding to the near decimation of parts of
the East German economy and the severe shortage of medical
personnel as a result of the recent exodus of East Germans to the
West.
   More than 200,000 East Germans have left East Germany since
September. There have been reports that medical students have been
drafted to work in hospitals to make up for the loss of doctors and
nurses.
   Turning his attention to other nations, von Weizsaecker, the
former West Berlin mayor, said: ``The West should be ready to help
East Germany with open hearts and open doors.''
   He cautioned that the West should not interfere in East Germany
internally but urged the East Berlin leadership to stick to its
promise of free elections.
   Weizsaecker later went through the new Berlin Wall crossing at
Potsdamer Platz, took several steps into East Berlin and exchanged
a few words with some border guards as he was mobbed by hundreds of
people.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper and his East Berlin counterpart,
Erhard Krack, met at the Potsdamer Platz, once a vibrant city
center but now a bleak no man's land bisected by the Berlin Wall
and flanked by concrete watchtowers.
   Their highly symbolic handshake represented a start of a new era
of optimism on closeness for the German people, although Krenz and
other officials have flatly ruled out reunification of the
countries.
   Earlier, thousands of people cheered as East German border
guards used jackhammers to bore a hole in the wall at Potsdamer
Platz. It was the fourth opening created in the wall since Friday.
The others are at Bernauer Strasse, Puschkinallee, Mahlow and the
Glienecker Bridge foot-crossing.
   ``It's a great day in our history and the history of the
world,'' said Torsten Fischer, a 20-year-old East German border
guard who has been doing wall duty for six months at Potsdamer
Platz.
   Cheering spectators on both sides of the concrete barrier
watched the reunion of mayors.
   Outside Berlin, East Germany opened at least 10 more border
crossings.
   British rock star Joe Cocker joined the party in Berlin with a
performance that drew thousands to the Deutschlandhalle concert
hall in the western sector, about two miles from the wall. He was
among more than 20 musicians peforming at the concert, which police
said was staged parly to drew crowds from the wall.

   Palestinians on Sunday hanged a suspected
pro-Israeli collaborator from a lamppost in a Gaza Strip refugee
camp and fatally stabbed another in the West Bank, residents said.
   Also Sunday, the government approved the establishment of a
Jewish settlement in the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel radio said.
   The United States and European nations oppose new settlements in
the occupied lands, saying they are an obstacle to peace. The
approval came three days before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
visits Washington. More than 70,000 Israelis live in about 130
settlements in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
   In the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, the body of Ahmed Mohammed
Jamil Shehadeh, 28, was found hanging from a lamppost early Sunday.
Arab reporters said he had been kidnapped by four men and was
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   In the West Bank village of Idna, masked Palestinians stabbed
and mortally wounded Abdel Hamid Nassar Tmaizi, 40, Arab reports
and hospital officials said. The army confirmed Tmaizi's death and
suggested that criminal motives were behind the slaying, but it did
not elaborate.
   On May 19, three armed guerrillas attacked Tmaizi's house, but
he escaped unharmed when a three-vehicle army convoy came to his
rescue. An Israeli army sergeant and all three Arab enforcers were
killed in an ensuing gun battle.
   Sunday's deaths brought to 146 the number of Palestinians killed
by other Palestinians, most on suspicion of assisting Israeli
authorities in the 23-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 613 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising, and 40 Israelis have been killed.
   The government approved of a new settlement in the northern Gaza
Strip, Israel radio said. It is one of eight Jewish settlements the
coalition government agreed would be built by 1992.
   Zvi Hender, the head of the Gaza Coast Regional council, told
Israel radio that foundation work would begin on the settlement
this week and the first 10 families would probably move into
temporary quarters in a few weeks.
   Shamir's 11-day visit to the United States begins with a meeting
Wednesday with President Bush.
   Israel is seeking assurances from Washington that proposed talks
between Israeli and Palestinian delegations will exclude the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the United States ``must find a
formula that satisfies us.''
   ``I believe if the Americans want to advance peace, and they do,
then they will find a solution to this problem,'' he told Israel
army radio.
   Speaking on Israel television Sunday night, Shamir said of the
U.S.-Israeli talks: ``There are certain differences of opinion that
can cause differences during discussions, but I see no reason for
confrontation.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-leaning Labor Party,
which opposes Shamir's hard-line approach, said in a speach that
Israel should be prepared to take risks for peace.
   ``Israel has taken chances in war and in making peace with
Egypt, and Israel therefore should take a calculated risk when it
comes to attempts to reach a peace agreement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Baker Says U.S. Aid to East Germany Must Await Economic Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Subs last graf to add Cheney interviewed on ``Meet the Press''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Sunday that any U.S. economic aid for East Germany must await clear
evidence that the East Bloc country is willing to reform its
economy, not just open its borders.
   The dramatic change unfolding in Berlin is a ``historic''
political event, ``but it doesn't mean a whole lot in economic
terms,'' Baker said.
   Baker, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' defended the Bush administration's cautious response to
the events, saying, ``It would be wrong to start funneling economic
assistance to any country in Eastern Europe ... before there is
clear evidence that they want to reform their economic system.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov praised
President Bush's response to the tumult in East Germany, saying,
``I think he's handling it as a real statesman.''
   Bush is still preparing a response to an informal cable he
received Friday from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
underscoring the importance of the changes taking place in East
Germany and expressing hope the situation remains calm and peaceful.
   Gerasimov, on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' predicted that at
next month's shipboard summit off Malta, Bush and Gorbachev ``may
come to a common ground ... that both countries _ and actually
everybody _ is interested in stability, in not too much upheaval in
Europe.''
   Baker said he believes Moscow would draw the line at any attempt
by its East Bloc allies to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, the
communist alliance's counterpart to the West's North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   But Baker said, ``They have made it very clear to us ... that
they will not use force in Eastern Europe.
   ``To do so, they said, would mean that perestroika has failed,''
he said, using the Russian word for the Soviet reforms.
   Baker said the administration wants to work with the Soviets
``to assist them where we can with technical economic advice in
their efforts to move to a free market economy.''
   The Soviets ``won't ask us for American cash,'' Baker said.
``They haven't yet. They've said they're not going to and I don't
believe we'll see that in Malta.''
   But if the Soviets want to move from competition to cooperation,
he added, ``we need to see cooperation in Central America.''
   The secretary of state said the United States wants to avoid
``overreacting'' to the situation in Eastern Europe or doing
anything to promote instability. He said it was premature to even
consider a meeting between Bush and new East German communist
leader Egon Krenz.
   He said the United States would welcome the eventual
reunification of the two Germanies ``as long as that reunification
comes about on the basis of Western values.'' But he stressed it is
too soon ``to make the great leap ... from right of free travel on
the part of East Germans to the question of reunification.''
   Baker ruled out any unilateral U.S. troop withdrawals from
Europe.
   ``The reason the wall's coming down is because we have
maintained our will and our resolve and our strength for 40 years,
and let's don't jump here before it's time to jump,'' Baker said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and other
Democrats have accused Bush of responding timidly to the East Bloc
shift toward democratic and economic reforms.
   The House last month passed an $837 million package to aid the
reform governments in Poland and Hungary, nearly double what Bush
requested for those two East Bloc states struggling to rebuild
their ailing economies and shift toward democratic freedoms.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who openly voiced skepticism
earlier in the year about Gorbachev's ability to survive, said
Sunday, ``Mr. Gorbachev is, indeed, for real.'' But Cheney added,
``I think Mr. Gorbachev's going to be in for a very rough winter.''
   The Soviet economy is ``a basket case at this point, in terrible
condition with labor strife, ethnic unrest,'' said Cheney.
   ``I think there's great uncertainty about what ultimately will
happen in the Soviet Union, and I think we have to judge our
policies accordingly,'' the defense chief said.
   He said the Soviets ``still have thousands of nuclear weapons
aimed at the United States,'' were patrons of the guerillas who
attacked the government of El Salvador earlier Sunday, and were
supporting the governments of Nicaragua and Cuba. ``I don't think
the United States ought to be in a position of providing material
assistance to the Soviets,'' Cheney said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.''

   Jets resumed flying from Dobbins Air Force
Base north of Atlanta on Sunday, three days after an attack plane
crashed into an apartment complex short of the runway, killing two
people.
   Petty Officer Linda Herring said the Navy considered Thursday's
crash an isolated incident and was not suspending any flight
operations.
   ``If an investigation indicates that changes should be made, we
will of course make them,'' she said.
   The investigation of the crash is expected to take at least 30
days.
   Officials at the Naval Air Station Atlanta, which is adjacent to
Dobbins about 15 miles north of Atlanta, said earlier that pilots
were taking a few days off from training flights in the wake of the
crash.
   The pilot of the A-7E Corsair II, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn
Jr., 37, remained in critical condition Sunday at Kennestone
Hospital. Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed plane and
ejected just before it crashed into the apartment complex two miles
short of the runway.
   Jacquelyn Padovani, 5, who suffered burns over about half of her
body, was in critical condition at Grady Memorial Hospital on
Sunday. Her pregnant mother, 28-year-old Margie Padovani, died
Friday night at the hospital from burns, and Richard Dick, 24, died
in his incinerated apartment.
   Smyrna officials said the crash destroyed 12 of the complex's 76
units and damaged another 20. Residents received more than $140,000
in interim compensation from the Navy on Saturday.

<HEAD>Serbians Vote for President of Republic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7 million Serbians in
Yugoslavia's largest republic voted Sunday in a referendum on their
next president. Nationalist Slobodan Milosevic was expected to win
the most support.
   Belgrade's official Socialist Youth organization dismissed the
referendum as anti-democratic, noting all four candidates are
members of the ruling Communist leadership.
   The voting is similar to a public opinion poll. The Serbian
Parliament will select the president of the republic from the two
candidates who get the most votes from the electorate, the state
Tanjug news agency said.
   Milosevic, 48, was named president of Serbia, the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics in May. He organized the tightening of
the republic's control over Kosovo province after members of
Kosovo's mainly Christian Serbian minority claimed harassment by
the Moslem ethnic Albanian majority.
   The moves were popular with Serbians but brought ethnic Albanian
protests and armed clashes in which at least 28 people have been
killed.
   Milosevic and other Serbian leaders have been criticized for not
permitting alternative political parties, which are allowed in the
more liberal northern republic of Slovenia.
   ``It is not a merry event to proclaim as a great democratic act
the voting for a single political concept,'' the Belgrade newspaper
Borba said.
   Leaders of Belgrade's Socialist Youth last week spoke of
``possible abuse'' of the elections, which are expected to lead to
Milosevic retaining his post for a four-year term.
   It called for ``realistic, political and organizational
conditions, which will make possible direct and free candidates and
elections.''

<HEAD>`Grand Hotel,' A New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The time is 1928, the place Berlin. The
Depression is only a year away, and Hitler waits to seize power in
Germany. But at the Grand Hotel, people are more concerned with
other, more important things _ like life, death, love, money.
   They are the subjects of ``Grand Hotel,'' the intoxicating,
evocative new musical that swept into Broadway's Martin Beck
Theater on Sunday night under the extraordinary guidance of Tommy
Tune.
   With Jerome Robbins' preoccupation with ballet and the deaths of
Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse and Gower Champion, Tune stands alone as
the foremost director and choreographer of Broadway musicals.
Although their approaches differed greatly, these men are linked by
their ability to make musicals move, to create productions that
soar through song, dance and story.
   And ``Grand Hotel,'' based on the Vicki Baum novel and the
famous MGM film starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, moves with
a fluidity that approaches the cinematic.
   Through the hotel's ever-revolving front door swirl a half dozen
characters whose stories will be played out before the evening's
two hours are over. All of them are introduced in a dazzling
opening number, ``The Grand Parade.''
   Grushinskaya, the aging ballerina, is on yet another farewell
tour, tended by her devoted companion, Raffaela. A young baron,
trying to find a way to pay his debts, contemplates stealing the
ballerina's jewels. Preysing, an industrialist, attempts to close a
big business deal before his career is ruined. Flaemmchen, a
secretary, stuck in a drab, dead-end job, longs to go to Hollywood
and become a movie star. Kringelein, a timid, terminally ill
accountant, discovers how to enjoy life in his dying moments.
   The book, written by Luther Davis with apparently an uncredited
assist from Peter Stone, telescopes their stories with grace and
wit without sacrificing characterization.
   Much of the score by Robert Wright and George Forrest was
augmented or revised by Maury Yeston, the composer and lyricist of
``Nine.'' Who wrote what is documented laboriously in the program.
Regardless of authorship, the music and lyrics fit together well,
particularly the period pastiches that suggest the sounds of the
late 1920s.
   The cast sings and dances with authority. As the ballerina,
Liliane Montevecchi is surprisingly funny, although she is not much
of an actress. The woman has a show biz snappiness that works well,
especially when she tears through the show's most heavily Parisian
number, ``Bonjour Amour.'' David Carroll, blessed with the
strongest voice in the cast, earns applause with the baron's
high-powered love song, ``Love Can't Happen.''
   Flaemmchen is a Germanic Betty Boop and, as played by Jane
Krakowski, becomes an utterly captivating creature, particularly
when she is dancing a Charleston with Kringelein (Michael Jeter).
   Jeter is astonishing in a second Charleston, ``We'll Take a
Glass Together,'' in which the loose-limbered little man dances his
way over the hotel bar. And Timothy Jerome, the greedy
industrialist, sings what could be show's best song, ``The Crooked
Path,'' with great glee. Karen Akers as the ballerina's morose
confidante is saddled with the musical's gloomiest numbers, but she
still manages to create a character.
   Tune interwines their tales brilliantly. The glamorous
introduction is interspersed with a hard, proletarian lament,
``Some Have, Some Have Not,'' from the hotel's scullery workers.
The musical and dance numbers blend with a flawless precision,
rarely stopping for star turns by the performers. There is a
dramatic tango near the end of the musical, but it serves to
underscore an important plot development rather than interrupt the
show.
   That seems to be the hallmark of Tune's sophisticated approach.
The show has enormous style that never slips to mere showiness. It
recalls such landmark musicals as ``Cabaret,'' ``Follies'' and even
``Evita,'' in which everything served the story.
   Tony Walton's stationary, two-tiered setting, composed of what
look like glass pillars, puts the orchestra above the action on the
second level. It's a restrained but expensive-looking environment
that allows the playing area to be set aside for dancing. Much of
the hotel's activity is mimed, from the telephone operators
answering calls, to the partying in the hotel bar, even down to the
workings of the washroom attendants.
   ``People come, people go, but nothing seems to change,'' says a
world-weary doctor, the hotel's one permanent resident, played with
a bitter ferocity by John Wylie. In ``Grand Hotel,'' Tune and
company have put an entire world on stage and in the process,
created a daring, provocative piece of musical theater.

<HEAD>State Police Commander Fired Over Tapings of Phone Calls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William A. O'Neill fired the state
police commander Sunday after revelations that the police secretly
tape-recorded telephone calls between suspects and their attorneys.
   The governor said he believed Commander Lester J. Forst's
assertion that he wasn't aware of the scope of the taping system,
but he said Forst had to go ``because the people have to be assured
that their police department is on their side.''
   O'Neill named former Hartford Police Chief Bernard R. Sullivan
to replace Forst as state police commander and public safety
commissioner.
   In a four-sentence letter to the governor, Forst said he was
resigning with ``profound regret.'' O'Neill said he had asked for
Forst's resignation.
   ``I have not violated any laws nor have I condoned any
wrongdoing. However, it has been my training for over 27 years to
serve the best interests of the state of Connecticut and the
Department of Public Safety,'' he wrote.
   Forst could not be reached immediately for comment. His home
phone number is not listed.
   The firing had been anticipated since The Hartford Courant
disclosed the tapings on Tuesday. Forst had been on a hunting
vacation in Alaska, and bad weather delayed his return until the
weekend.
   Calls between suspects and their attorneys were taped as part of
a system that recorded all incoming and outgoing calls at the state
police's 12 regional barracks.
   The state police have said the tapes generally were not listened
to unless police needed to verify details of an incoming call, for
example, or check on any complaints from the public about the
handling of a call.
   The governor's legal counsel, the attorney general and the chief
state's attorney are examining state police taping policies, as
well as those at local police departments. In addition, the U.S.
attorney for Connecticut and the FBI are investigating whether the
tapings violated federal wiretap laws.
   O'Neill also ordered an immediate halt to recordings of
attorney-client calls.
   A group of criminal defense lawyers have filed a class-action
suit against the state seeking unspecified damages for clients who
may have had their private phone conversations recorded. The
lawyers have said they expect prisoners to seek new trials.
   Forst's ouster culminated a stormy, eight-year career as
commissioner that saw him at the center of controversies over
budget overruns and the use of informants.
   The taping activity ``should not have been done, was wrong and
cannot be tolerated,'' O'Neill said at a news conference with
Sullivan.
   ``Do I believe it was done with intent and malice aforethought?
The answer to that is probably not,'' O'Neill said.
   The governor said he chose Sullivan rather than promoting
someone from within the department to make sure the controversy
would not overshadow the state police.
   O'Neill said Sullivan, 46, had assured him that attorney-client
calls were never recorded by the Hartford police.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
embraced Poland's prime minister in a sign of reconciliation
between the two nations during a Mass Sunday in a village on former
German territory.
   About 5,000 worshipers applauded the gesture by Kohl and Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in Krzyzowa. During World War II
members of the anti-Nazi resistance met in Krzyzowa, known in
German as Kreisau.
   Dense fog shrouded Warsaw, forcing Kohl to travel six hours by
bus rather than plane to reach Krzyzowa after he resumed his visit
to Poland _ interrupted by a brief trip home to discuss
developments in East Germany.
   Kohl returned to Warsaw Sunday evening for talks with Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski; Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity
activist, and Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's spokesman, told reporters afterward that the
talks had focused on East Germany's opening of the Berlin Wall and
other borders to the West. He characterized the talks as
``unusually intense and open.''
   Poland has welcomed the new East German freedoms, but the
prospect of reuniting the two Germanys is met with suspicion in a
nation overrun by Germany in World War II and still insecure about
its western border.
   On Sunday, the West German leader _ the first to visit Poland
since 1977 _ sought to erase the bitter Nazi German legacy.
   Bishop Alfons Nossol celebrated the 90-minute Roman Catholic
service in Polish and in German, saying it could serve as
reconciliation between the Germans and Poles.
   ``We have heard in the sermon,'' Kohl said, that ``we should
never forget history, but we also have to learn from history. I
think it was just this moment of learning of history. We have
greeted one another in the sign of reconciliaton.''
   West German diplomats in Warsaw said Kohl attached great
symbolic importance to the visit to Krzyzowa. Kohl appeared moved
when he embraced Mazowiecki after the congregation was asked to
give the sign of peace to one another.
   One-third of all current Polish territory was German before
World War II. An estimated 80,000 ethnic Germans remain, mostly in
the former German territories of Silesia and East Prussia.
   Polish-German relations in the region have been strained since
the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939. Millions of Germans were
expelled after the regions were awarded to Poland after the war.
Those displaced Germans remain a strong political force in West
Germany.
   Reporters at the Mass and Polish radio said about 5,000 people
attended the service, which was broadcast on television. Some held
banners in German saying, ``We demand German schools and church
services,'' and ``Helmut you are our chancellor too.''
   Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist leader in the Soviet bloc,
appealed for greater ``brotherhood'' between Germans and Poles.
   Although a 1970 treaty pledges West Germany's respect of the
Oder and Neisse rivers as Poland's western border, West German
conservatives have recently suggested seeking reunification within
pre-war borders, which include large areas of present-day Poland.
   After the Mass, Kohl was to travel to Czestochowa, the holiest
shrine in Poland, before returning to the capital for a meeting
with President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   During Kohl's trip, the two sides signed eight agreements. They
include one for $1.5 billion in economic assistance from West
Germany.

   Federal prosecutors filed suit Sunday against the
owners of a Greek freighter for damaging the environment when the
vessel ran aground on a fragile coral reef off the Florida Keys.
   U.S. marshals seized the 470-foot MV Elpis on Saturday after it
was floated off the reef by high tide. The vessel, laden with sugar
and bound for Mexico from the Netherlands, ran aground about 5
miles off Key Largo late Friday.
   It was the third ship to run aground off the Keys in less than
three weeks. All hit at night, but in fair weather in areas marked
by navigational lights.
   Federal agents boarded the ship late Saturday and moved it to
anchorage off Miami Beach, Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Department of Justice in Miami, said Sunday. Marshals then went
aboard and served a warrant to keep the ship there, she said.
   ``We are filing charges against the ship and the ship's owners,
alleging damage to the reef and the consequent future damage to the
ecosystem within the (Key Largo) National Marine Sanctuary,'' she
said.
   The government will seek to recover damages and costs of
recovery, but Cossin wouldn't cite specific figures until federal
marine scientists make a report.
   The Justice Department has filed a $9 million lawsuit against
the Yugoslav freighter Mavro Vetranic, which ran aground off the
Keys late last month, alleging the ship was unseaworthy and the
crew incompetent.
   A Coast Guard board of inquiry is to convene Monday to
investigate the Elpis grounding and question crew members, said
Captain Herbert Robinson, commanding officer of the Coast Guard
Marine Safety Office in Miami.
   The crew was not tested for drug or alcohol use, the Coast Guard
said.
   Gov. Bob Martinez has amended an executive order to expand a
criminal investigation of the first two groundings to include the
Elpis accident.
   The Elpis accident took place about four miles south of where
the 155-foot freighter Alec Owen Maitland ran aground Oct. 25,
cutting a 200-foot swath in the reef.
   Five days later, the 475-foot Mavro Vetranic ran aground off the
Dry Tortugas in the far wester Keys, destroying about 500 feet of
coral.
   The reef is the world's third largest living reef, extending
about 200 miles from Miami to the Dry Tortugas. It is well-marked
by lighthouses and other navigational aids and shouldn't be
difficult to navigate, especially in fair weather, Coast Guard
spokesman Jim Wentworth said.
   ``You can see the change in color between the deep and shallow
water and it's well marked by buoys,'' he said. ``I don't know why
these groundings are happening, but they shouldn't be.''
   Reef experts say it could take nature hundreds of years to
repair the damage to the reef.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former savings and loan regulator who told
Congress he was pressured by five senators to go easy on one of
their major campaign contributors has been questioned by FBI agents
apparently looking into whether laws were violated, according to
published reports.
   Meanwhile, another newspaper said one of the five senators,
Democrat Alan Cranston of California, continued to intercede with
federal regulators on behalf of financier Charles H. Keating Jr.
for two years after auditors urged the takeover of Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   Edwin Gray, former head of the Home Loan Bank Board, told the
House Banking Committee last week that he was asked at an April 2
meeting with four of the five Senators to ease regulatory pressure
on Lincoln by dropping a rule barring the thrift's risky
investments.
   The four at the meeting were Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John
McCain, R-Ariz., Cranston, and John Glenn, D-Ohio. Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., has acknowledged making subsequent entreaties
on Keating's behalf, although he did not attend the meeting.
   Together, the five received $1.3 million in campaign
contributions from Keating, who has told reporters he certainly
hoped his contributions had bought influence with the senators.
   In a related matter, The Arizona Republic reported on Sunday
that Federal Election Commission records show DeConcini also may
have received $600 in illegal campaign contributions from a
Phoenix-based home building company.
   The company, Emerald Homes, was identified in a $1.1 billion
federal racketeering lawsuit as participating with Keating and
others in fraudulent real-estate transactions involving Lincoln.
   The questionable contribution was made by Emerald executive
William P. Junge who sent DeConcini a note two months ago
indicating Emerald ``actually made this contribution,'' the
Republic said.
   Although it is not clear when the FBI questioning reported by
The Boston Globe on Saturday and The Washington Post on Sunday
began, the chief of the Justice Department's public integrity
section wrote to Common Cause on Oct. 24 that the department would
thoroughly review the political watchdog's call for an
investigation into whether Keating's actions violated federal
election laws, or other laws.
   While declining to comment on whether the FBI is conducting an
investigation, a Justice Department official pointed out Sunday
that such interviews by agents would be normal practice in a
preliminary review of allegations that laws had been violated.
   The Globe's report Saturday quoted two ``well-placed sources''
as saying Gray was interviewed by agents last week and that Gray
declined to confirm whether he was questioned. The report did not
say whether the interviews took place before or after Gray's
congressional testimony.
   The Post account said other regulators also were questioned, but
did not say whether they were among those who also gave testimony
that backed up Gray's assertions to the House panel last week.
   All five of the senators have acknowledged taking campaign money
from Keating and interceding on his behalf. All five, likewise,
have denied any wrongdoing.
   The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News reported Sunday that Cranston
continued to intercede with Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall.
   The paper quoted Cranston's top aide, Roy F. Greenaway, as
acknowledging that the senator was pushing early this year for a
quick sale of Lincoln and said he did it because the sale would
have averted a taxpayer bailout of the thrift and would have taken
``Keating out of the savings and loan business'' even though
Keating would have remained an investor.

   Leftist rebels launched their
biggest offensive in San Salvador in the 10-year-old civil war,
battling troops in fighting in which at least 127 people were
killed, the military said Sunday.
   President Alfredo Cristiani declared a curfew and state of
siege. Cristiani's official residence was among the targets of the
rebels' offensive, launched Saturday night. He was at his private
home and was not hurt.
   Hospitals reported at least 197 people were wounded in the
offensive, which continued Sunday.
   An American teacher was among the dead.
   Rebels claimed 400 soldiers were killed or wounded.
   There were reports of fighting in four of the country's 14
provinces, including the northern section of San Salvador. The
international airport was closed after military installations were
attacked by mortar fire.
   Cristiani announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and the state of
siege in an address on radio and television. The state of siege
restricts transit, the freedom of expression, rights of assembly
and privacy of correspondence.
   ``You must heed the call to not go out in the streets, to stay
in your houses or where you are right now. It's just a question of
a short time,'' Cristiani said.
   His Cabinet approved the measure and the legislative assembly
will vote on it Monday, the president said.
   ``The terrorists must know that there are judicial tools to
fight these irrational attacks.''
   The armed forces press office said 26 soldiers had been killed
and 65 wounded. Guerrilla deaths totaled 93 and 55 were wounded, it
said. Rebels gave no figures on their own casualties.
   The armed forces said eight civilians were killed and 35 wounded.
   Carlos Mendoza, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said in
a telephone interview that at least 20 civilians had been killed.
   ``We have identified five of the bodies, but there are at least
15 whose identities we have not yet established,'' he said.
   Among those killed Saturday night was a U.S. citizen who taught
at the American High School in San Salvador, according to U.S.
Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs. Jacobs gave no details and said the
victim's name was being withheld pending notification of family
members.
   Hospitals reported 197 civilians were wounded.
   A doctor at Hospital Rosales, one of the largest in the capital
of San Salvador, told The Associated Press by telephone that 156
civilians wounded by weapons and explosives had been admitted to
that hospital.
   The attacks came three days after the Farabundo Marti Liberation
Front vowed to intensify the insurgency, in which more than 70,000
people, mostly civilians, have been killed in a decade of fighting.
   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, the
guerrillas said the San Salvador attacks were part of a national
offensive called ``Remove the fascists, Febe Elizabeth lives.''
   Febe Elizabeth Velazquez was a union leader who perished in an
Oct. 31 explosion at the National Federation of Salvadoran Workers.
The rebels claim the U.S.-backed government was behind that attack
that killed 10 people and wounded more than 30.
   ``Today we are fighting against misery, against those who stay
in power through savagery aimed at churches, universities,
opposition political parties, guilds, unions and dissident
sectors,'' the rebel broadcast said.
   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador National
University Sunday and damaged some buildings when they opened fire,
a photographer said.
   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken by truck to
a military base, according to the photographer. He said the
prisoners were accused of harboring guerrillas.
   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandez
told reporters Sunday, ``Here we will die fighting. They won't
remove us from here.''
   At a news conference at a home in the northern part of the
capital, the guerrilla leader said, ``This is the start of the
counteroffensive. We won't leave until the government gives up or
calls us to the negotiating table.''
   Civilian sources contacted by telephone reported fighting in
four of 14 provinces.
   In Managua, Nicaragua, the government-run radio Voice of
Nicaragua broadcast a statement by Salvadoran guerrillas warning
civilians living near military installations to leave.
   The rebel statement also warned Salvadorans that areas near
downed power lines had been mined and said first-aid vehicles
should not transport military casualties. It said gasoline service
stations should close immediately and all transportation should
stop at midnight.
   Military headquarters in the eastern cities of San Miguel and
Usulutan were attacked, said Col. Rene Ponce, chief of the joint
chiefs of staff.
   He said other rebels targets included the home of the president
of the legislative assembly, Ricardo Alvarenga; the 1st Infantry
Brigade; police headquarters in the Mejicanos neighborhood; the 3rd
Infantry Brigade in San Miguel, and the 6th Brigade in Usulutan.
   Alvarenga escaped injury but the attack on his house left at
least one guerrilla dead and two guards wounded, hospital officials
said.
   Cristiani is the leader of the rightist Nationalist Republican
Alliance, or Arena, and was installed in office June 1 after
winning the presidential election.

   More than 150,000 pro-choice activists,
reveling in their victories at the polls last week, promised at a
Washington rally Sunday to carry their fight for abortion rights
into the 1990 election campaigns.
   A parade of politicians, Democrats and Republicans, and
entertainers headlined the demonstration and energized the crowd
that stretched from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial along the
reflecting pool to the Washington Monument.
   ``Turn up the heat across the nation,'' Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., urged the crowd that waved signs and chanted pro-choice
slogans for about five hours on a sunny, mild autumn day. ``While
the other side is out bombing (abortion) clinics, we'll be electing
candidates and passing laws.''
   Police estimated that more than 150,000 turned out for the
rally, but rally organizers put the figure at around 300,000.
   ``Today is historic and it marks for all of us no turning
back,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women. ``This will be the issue of 1990.''
   The Washington rally, organized by NOW, was the largest of a
string of demonstrations and other events that began Sunday morning
with a sunrise service in Kennebunk, Maine, near President Bush's
vacation retreat in Kennebunkport.
   More than 300,000 pro-choice activists rallied at the Capitol in
April in anticipation of a Supreme Court ruling in a Missouri
abortion case.
   The court left intact its landmark 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, but the justices gave the states broad authority to
restrict women's rights to terminate their pregnancies.
   ``The Supreme Court did us a great favor,'' said Mary Ann Baker
of Youngstown, Ohio. ``It got us off our complacent behinds.''
   The court will hear three cases later this month and in December
seeking to further restrict a woman's right to abortion.
   Galvanized by election victories for pro-choice candidates
earlier this month in Virginia and New Jersey, demonstrators said
they were encouraged that politicians would not be able to ignore
them in the next round of elections.
   ``People know that the politicians have been given the word that
being anti-abortion is a bad position to be in,'' said Elizabeth
Chipley of Vienna, Va., a Washington suburb, who was accompanied by
her husband and two daughters.
   Members of another family attending the rally said they were
concerned that President Bush's stand against abortion will hurt
the Republican Party and mar an administration they worked to put
in office.
   ``This is sending a message to Republicans to listen up,'' said
Jennifer Salandi of Darnestown, Md. ``I don't want to see it damage
the whole party,'' she said, but added that many women ``are going
to vote Democratic because of this issue.''
   Cranston and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said legislation will be
introduced in Congress soon to prohibit states from interferring
with women's right to abortion.
   ``We will not let Americans return to the days of the back
alley,'' Cranston said.
   Actress Ruby Dee and singers Pete Seeger, Helen Reddy, Pete
Yarrow and Mary Travers helped to entertain the crowd.
   About 30 anti-abortion demonstrators gathered near the Lincoln
Memorial in an area that was roped off from the pro-choice
demonstrators. A few carried signs and one demonstrator used a
megaphone to address abortion-rights activists, who drowned him out
with their own chants of ``Pro-choice, pro-choice.''
   One man was arrested for demonstrating without a permit when he
ventured beyond his designated area. He was fined $50 and released.
A woman arrested for disorderly conduct was fined $25 and released.
   Meanwhile, two women running for governor said the recent
pro-choice election victories will buoy their chances and those of
other abortion-rights candidates.
   Diane Feinstein, a former Democratic mayor of San Francisco and
candidate for governor in California, said more women must be
elected to top political jobs because ``we can best plead our
case,'' and the message, she said, is ``keep your hands off our
right to choose.''
   Lt. Gov. Joann Zimmerman of Iowa, a Democrat running for
governor, urged that politicians' feet be kept to the fire to
assure that someone who says they are pro-choice will not later
vote otherwise.
   ``We must elect people who will not trade us off,'' she said.

   Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher placed wreaths at London's Cenotaph Sunday to honor
Britain's war dead and observed two minutes silence when Big Ben
struck 11:00 a.m.
   Throughout Britain, at church services and local war memorials,
Britons marked Remembrance Sunday, held annually on the Sunday
nearest the 11th day of the 11th month.
   Under blue skies, the queen laid a wreath of poppies at the
Cenotaph, the stone war memorial erected after World War I. She was
followed by other members of the royal family, ambassadors and
military leaders.
   Buglers from the Royal Marine Band, 11 of whose members were
killed recently in an Irish Republican Army bombing, played ``Last
Post.''
   Columns of former servicemen and women marched past the Cenotaph.
   In the afternoon rival groups of demonstrators scuffled at the
memorial as hundreds of right-wing National Front supporters held a
service.
   Protesters chanted ``Nazi scum off our streets'' as Front
members observed a minute's silence.
   Police said 31 people were arrested for disorderly conduct.

   Two teen-agers were in custody
Sunday in the slayings of a General Motors Corp. executive and his
wife after police spotted one of the youths driving a car that
belonged to the victims.
   The bullet-riddled bodies of Glenn E. Tarr, 53, and his wife,
Wanda, 58, were found in a park in nearby Pontiac on Friday, a day
after their home was ransacked and robbed and their cars stolen.
   Warrants charging a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy with
the killings were being sought late Sunday and probably would be
brought Monday, said Sgt. Maurice McAllister, of the county
Sheriff's Department.
   One of the youths was seen driving a car that belonged to the
Tarrs on Saturday afternoon in Rochester Hills, said McAllister. A
gun was found in the vehicle and was believed to have been used in
the killings, he said.
   Sheriff's Capt. Lewis Doyle said investigators believe the
teen-agers abducted Mrs. Tarr when she stopped at an automatic
teller machine Thursday night in Rochester Hills, then forced her
to return home.
   Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection also were
taken from the home, police said.
   Tarr, a 25-year GM employee, was assistant manager of marketing
information and research for the Chevrolet Division headquarters in
Warren, said GM spokesman Jim Crellin. Mrs. Tarr was a life
insurance saleswoman.

   The FBI is investigating a possible
connection between an attempted kidnapping outside Minneapolis last
week and the abduction of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling last month,
an FBI spokesman said Sunday.
   A 10-year-old boy was riding home on his bicycle Wednesday
evening in the suburb of New Brighton when a stranger ordered him
to get into his car, spokesman Byron Gigler said. The boy rode away
and his mother saw the man's car speed off, he said.
   A sketch of the man based on the boy's description matches two
sketches of a man seen acting suspiciously at a store in St.
Joseph, 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis, shortly before
Wetterling was abducted Oct. 22, Gigler said.
   ``All three sketches bear some resemblance to the same man,'' he
said.
   They depict a man described as white, 6 feet tall, about 200
pounds, in his 50s, with a large build, white hair and a receding
hair line.
   The New Brighton boy's mother didn't get a good look at the
suspect's car because it was dark and the car was speeding, Gigler
said.
   Jacob Wetterling was abducted at gunpoint near his home as he
was returning from the convenience store with his brother and a
friend.
   Stearns County Sheriff Charlie Grafft said investigators have
received more than 12,000 tips from around the country regarding
the disappearance.

   Two senior Bush administration officials on
Sunday called this weekend's guerrilla offensive in El Salvador a
``desperate'' move by the insurgents and said they expect the
U.S.-backed government to be able to handle it without assistance.
   Leftist rebels attacked the residence of right-wing President
Alfredo Cristiani and other official buildings Saturday night and
occupied several sectors of the northern part of San Salvador,
where fighting continued Sunday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' program, said he did not believe U.S. military personnel
would get involved.
   ``We've got, of course, advisers in El Salvador, but I think the
government of El Salvador can handle it,'' he said.
   The Pentagon chief added that ``I think there's a bit of a view
that the attack on the city basically is a move of desperation by
the guerrillas, that the FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front) ... is under a lot pressure from the Salvadoran government
and that this is an effort to try to dramatize their posture.''
   Hours later Cristiani announced a dusk to dawn curfew and
declared a state of siege in an address on Salvadoran radio and
television. The state of siege, approved by the Cabinet, restricts
transit, the freedom of expression, rights of assembly and privacy
of correspondence. The legislative assembly would vote on the
measure Monday.
   The White House would not comment on the new developments, said
spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, interviewed on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley,'' said that ``as far as we know
this morning, the American community is accounted for _ that is,
the Americans resident in El Salvador and the diplomats and
military people that we have there.''
   ``I can tell you that I believe there has been one American
casualty, a schoolteacher, killed. There are no other American
casualties, as far as I know,'' he said. He did not identify the
teacher.
   Baker said that ``this appears to be an action that te
insurgency in El Salvador, the FMLN, has undertaken _ a rather
desperate action, in my view _ to disrupt the negotiations that
they were having with the government towards seeking a political
accommodation.''
   The secretary of state said he does not believe the offensive
threatens to destabilize the Salvadoran government because ``I
think the government of El Salvador can handle this, militarily and
defensively.''
   The attacks came three days after the FMLN promised to intensify
its decade-old insurgency against the U.S.-backed government. More
than 70,000 people have been killed in the guerrilla war.

   Republican governors gathered
Sunday to take political stock after the party's 1989 setbacks, and
their leaders said that with better candidates and better handling,
the GOP can avoid trouble on the abortion issue in 1990.
   Three of the governors agreed at an opening night news
conference that Republican candidates should spell out clear
positions on the issue and avoid being typecast as anti-abortion.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, the conference
host, said Republicans running in 1989 allowed themselves to be
cornered on the issue by the news media and by their Democratic
opponents.
   ``The problem with Republicans is that they have not gone out in
advance and told the public what they believe in,'' `Campbell said.
He said the Democrats defined the issue in their own terms this
year.
   ``You'll beat nothing with something every time you put it on
the table,'' he said.
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas, chairman of the Republican Governors
Association, said this year's elections point to the need for
aggressive efforts to recruit strong GOP candidates in 1990. Asked
whether he was suggesting that the Republicans who lost last
Tuesday weren't strong candidates, Hayden said ``Well, they didn't
win.''
   Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, the vice chairman, also sought
to play down the issue, saying the political trouble is at the
extremes, and that the anti-abortion plank of the 1988 Republican
platform won't define the positions GOP candidates for governor
take in 1990.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and Lee Atwater, the party chairman,
were the featured political performers at the governors's two-day
resort conference.
   It opened Sunday with several of the governors, and Quayle,
playing golf in advance of formal sessions planned Monday and
Tuesday.
   Fifteen of the 22 Republican governors were due to attend the
annual conference. That overall number will go down by one when New
Jersey switches hands with the inauguration of a Democrat next year.
   Republicans were defeated there and in Virginia, where the
incumbent is a Democrat, in last Tuesday's off-year balloting. The
Virginia election was the closest in state history, and a recount
is likely.
   Democrats claimed major headway in elections across the nation
and the Republicans could only say, as President Bush did, wait
until next year.
   Quayle's keynote address at the conference on Monday is likely
to look toward the next campaign, when 36 states will elect
governors, 34 will choose senators and all 435 House seats will be
at stake.
   Atwater will concentrate on the politics of reapportionment in
his report to the governors. The state governments shaped in the
1990 elections will be in charge of reapportioning House seats on
the basis of next year's census, and Republicans fear that the
Democrats who have controlled the House for 35 years may draw
district lines that will strengthen that advantage.
   The governors also are to hear reports on the twin problems of
crime and drugs, from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and William
Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   Their final conference session on Tuesday is to deal with
education.

   Abortion-rights activists, fresh from electoral triumphs in New
Jersey and Virginia, waved lights at rallies from coast to coast
Sunday hoping to generate new momentum and illuminate the
``darkness of back alley despair.''
   ``I am pro-choice, and I light the light of choice,'' U.S. Rep.
Barbara Boxer told 2,000 cheering demonstrators at a downtown San
Francisco park Sunday evening. Boxer led the crowd in lighting
plastic imitation candles illuminated by chemicals and chanting
pro-choice slogans.
   The day's events played upon President Bush's ``thousand points
of light'' theme and began with a sunrise candlelight service in
Kennebunk, Maine, near Bush's vacation retreat.
   Pro-choice activists were energized last week by the success of
gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey who support the
right to an abortion.
   In Washington, tens of thousands of demonstrators jammed the
Mall, filling the area between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument.
   U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd by early afternoon at
150,000, said Lt. W.T. Lynch. Organizers, however, estimated the
turnout at 300,000.
   ``Turn up the heat across the nation,'' Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., urged the crowd that waved signs and chanted pro-choice
slogans for about five hours on a sunny, mild autumn day. ``While
the other side is out bombing (abortion) clinics, we'll be electing
candidates and passing laws.''
   ``Today is historic and it marks for all of us no turning
back,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women. ``This will be the issue of 1990.''
   In Los Angeles' Rancho Park, Rev. Jesse Jackson told a
celebrity-laden crowd estimated by police at 20,000 that women
aren't ``puppets of the court.'' ``We are creatures of a creator
who endowed us with choice,'' Jackson said. ``In our society, women
are burdened with choices and they must have the freedom to choose
a response to those burdens.''
   Speakers at several rallies linked support for abortion rights
to the struggle for freedom in the Communist bloc.
   ``Anti-choice is our Berlin Wall, and together, we will make it
fall forever,'' author and activist Gloria Steinem told about 1,300
people in Atlanta.
   An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people gathered at the Texas
Capitol in Austin where Attorney General Jim Mattox said a close
friend of his had died 29 years ago as the result of an illegal
abortion.
   ``It taught me very clearly, whether abortions are legal or not,
we will continue to have them,'' he said.
   In Chattanooga, Tenn., pro-choice advocates delivered flowers to
the homes of politicians who favor abortion rights.
   In Jefferson City, Mo., police estimated about 5,000 people
turned out for a rally where leaders implored participants to
become politically active.
   ``When you go home today and the glow begins to fade, mobilize,
register voters, work the polls, turn 'em out,'' said state Rep.
Karen McCarthy.
   About 1,800 Louisiana pro-choice advocates gathered in New
Orleans' City Park while 600 anti-abortion protesters walked the
park's perimeter, police said. Taunts were exchanged but there was
no violence.
   In Providence, R.I., Rep. Claudine Schneider, whom the state's
Roman Catholic bishop criticized as not living up to the church's
stand on abortion, attended an ecumenical service Sunday held by
pro-choice Catholics.
   Pro-choice rallies also were held in Lincoln, Neb.; Topeka,
Kan.; Charleston, W.Va.; Tallahassee, Fla.; Montgomery, Ala.;
Oklahoma City; Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Milwaukee;
Chicago; Watertown, N.Y., and Seattle.
   In Kennebunk, Maine, some 1,000 activists crowded in and around
the First Parish Unitarian Church, several miles from Bush's
vacation home in Kennebunkport, for a predawn ceremony.
   ``What better place to begin than on our president's back
porch?'' said Faye Wattleton, president of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America. ``We have to say to Mr. Bush that it is not
kinder and it is not gentler to force a woman to remain pregnant
against her will.''
   The protesters carried plastic imitation candles, as in San
Francisco.
   ``Here at dawn, we kindle a thousand points of light _ our own
thousand points of light _ to say that we will never again accept
the darkness of back alley despair, never return to the dark ages
of pain and abuse,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
   A handful of abortion opponents marched in front of the
Kennebunk church, some waving signs reading ``Abortion is murder.''
   The church service was followed by a march to Bush's home in
neighboring Kennebunkport. Bush was not at the family's estate.
   The renewed debate on abortion stems from the Supreme Court's
ruling July 3 upholding Missouri laws restricting abortion by
banning the use of public funds, employees and facilities to
perform abortions, and by requiring doctors to test fetuses for
viability in some cases.
   In Pennsylvania, the state Senate will consider a bill Tuesday
that requires husbands be notified of abortions, a 24-hour waiting
period and prohibits abortions based on the sex of the fetus.
   Backed by Gov. Robert P. Casey, the bill has passed the House
and is expected to clear the Senate, making Pennsylvania the first
state to enact abortion restrictions since the Supreme Court ruling.

   An environmental mystery is springing up
along interstate highway medians from Boston to Philadelphia: How
did those fluffy yellow wildflowers, usually found along beaches,
find their way inland?
   ``This is kind of intriguing,'' said Leslie J. Mehrhoff, a
botanist with the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection. ``There are not many cases where you can watch a native
plant undergo this kind of apparently rapid explosion into new
habitats.''
   The plants, called seaside goldenrod, grow as high as 8 feet,
produce 6-inch-long, deep-yellow clumps of flowers that linger into
November. They have been spotted in patches along Interstate 91 in
Connecticut, I-84 in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, and
along the Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Jersey turnpikes.
   Part of the mystery is that the flower isn't found along some
other interstates. For instance, it hasn't been seen along Route
128 near Boston, nor along I-495. And it doesn't seem to grow on
the Massachusetts Turnpike west of Sturbridge.
   ``Why it drops out there is a mystery,'' said Bruce A. Sorrie,
staff botanist for the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and
Endangered Species Program.
   Botanists say they don't know exactly when the plant began its
move. Mehrhoff said she remembers seeing a few seaside goldenrod
along I-84 in the early 1980s. Since then it has spread quickly. As
time is measured in botanical terms, its growth has been lightning
quick.
   ``We don't have any good data on movement of plant species at
that kind of rate,'' Sorrie said.
   Botanists agree that road salt spread in the winter by highway
crews may have helped the plant take hold since it ordinarily grows
along salty beaches or marshes.
   How they got inland is another question. Sorrie and Mehrhoff
said they couldn't remember any projects in which the flowers were
planted. Sorrie said one theory is that goldenrod seeds were
carried inland by cars and trucks.
   But if so, he asked, ``Why don't you see them along I-495?''

   Thousands of Peruvians defied rebel threats
and voted Sunday in mayoral elections. Maoist guerrillas trying to
disrupt the balloting killed a candidate and blew up a church, a
school and power lines.
   Four people were killed Sunday night, including a mother and her
baby, when one of the victims stepped on a mine on a road a few
miles north of the Andean city of Huancayo, police reported. They
said two people in nearby Concepcion were electrocuted Sunday by
power lines after guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement
blew up a utility pole.
   Authorities extended voting in Lima for two hours to accommodate
lines of people waiting to cast ballots, but voting was slower in
the Andean highlands, where a rebel-decreed strike paralyzed public
transportation.
   An exit poll commissioned by television Channel 5 showed Ricardo
Belmont, an independent, the clear winner in Lima's mayoral race
with 49.6 percent of the vote.
   Juan Inchaustegui, runner-up in the field of nine candidates
with 26 percent, conceded defeat and congratulated Belmont.
Inchaustegui was the candidate of a center-right coalition backing
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in next April's presidential election.
   The main parties with candidates in most of the municipal races
are the United Left, a Marxist-led alliance, and the Democratic
Front.
   Vargas Llosa, who is favored to win the presidential race,
called Sunday's vote ``very important to the future of our country
... to demonstrate that Peruvians do not fear the extremist
minorities that want to destroy our democracy.''
   Although voting was heavy in Lima and other large coastal
cities, the terror campaign by the Shining Path rebels frightened
some voters.
   Officials said that in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima and
considered a Shining Path stronghold, 68.7 percent of the votes
cast were blank or null. Voting is required by law.
   With Peru suffering 3,000 percent annual inflation and economic
chaos, the governing center-left Aprista Party was given little
chance of winning many mayoral races.
   Death threats by the rebels, who have killed scores of officials
and candidates this year, frightened anyone from running for office
in more than 80 municipalities.
   ``We must put aside the threats and go forward,'' said Francisco
Vega, 56, one of about 5,000 voters who waited quietly outside a
school in Lurigancho, a shantytown set amid sand dunes on the
outskirts of Lima.
   ``I am voting because I believe in democracy, not because
someone is forcing me to,'' said the 56-year-old Vega, who like
many in Lurigancho migrated from the Andes highlands in search of a
better life.
   Soldiers armed with assault rifles patrolled the streets. Armed
police and soldiers also provided heavy security at voting places.
   Authorities said Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed the
Aprista mayoral candidate early Sunday in Azangaro, near the
Bolivian border 470 miles southeast of Lima.
   In Huancayo, capital of Junin department 140 miles east of Lima,
the rebels dynamited a church and a school early Sunday.
   The attacks followed more than 20 explosions around the city
Saturday night intended to disrupt the voting as the first stage in
their campaign to block the presidential election next April.
   Rebels this year alone have killed more than 130 mayors, local
judges, clerks, council members and municipal candidates, and
hundreds more have resigned in fear for their lives.
   Some 10 million Peruvians were registered to vote. Peru has
1,947 municipalities, but election authorities said there were no
candidates in at least 86 towns due to rebel death threats.
   Voting is required. In the past voters have had to dip their
middle fingers in purple ink that does not wear off easily. In the
days before the last presidential election in 1985, Shining Path
rebels cut off the fingers of children in several highland villages
in a warning to adults against voting.
   Rumors circulated around Lima's shantytowns that anyone who
voted Sunday would suffer the same fate. The national election
board left the decision of whether to use the ink up to local
boards.
   In Lima, election officials used the ink, which is intended to
prevent repeat balloting.

   Haagen-Dazs ran out of ice cream bars Sunday, a
rare occurrence in November. Burger King was out of beer by early
afternoon. Even cash machines were empty as more than a million
visitors swarmed through West Berlin.
   East Germans crossing the now-porous Berlin Wall, and West
Berliners drawn to the impromptu international street festival,
bought all the fruit and coffee available and flooded businesses
from pretzel stands to peep shows.
   Hordes of East Germans grabbed everything from lettuce to
radios, cleaning out stores in West German cities and towns near
the border, from Luebeck in the north to Hof in Bavaria.
   City officials, restaurateurs and shopkeepers found their
supplies of goods falling short, but their good will appeared to be

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Sunday that any U.S. economic aid for East Germany must await clear
evidence that the East Bloc country is willing to reform its
economy, not just open its borders.
   The dramatic change unfolding in Berlin is a ``historic''
political event, ``but it doesn't mean a whole lot in economic
terms,'' Baker said.
   Baker, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' defended the Bush administration's cautious response to
the events, saying, ``It would be wrong to start funneling economic
assistance to any country in Eastern Europe ... before there is
clear evidence that they want to reform their economic system.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov praised
President Bush's response to the tumult in East Germany, saying,
``I think he's handling it as a real statesman.''

   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, confronted by a
growing movement against the draft, lashed out at ``anti-army
manifestations'' and ruled out change in conscription rules, the
official Tass news agency said Sunday.
   The report came a day after the Latvian Supreme Soviet, in a
move that carried more symbolic than legal force, voted to allow
alternative service to conscientious objectors in the Baltic
republic.
   Tass said Yazov ``condemned anti-army manifestations which
recently spread in some regions of the country _ calls to refuse
service in the army, attempts to evade call-up into the armed
forces, blockade of call-up stations, etc.''
   The Tass report indicated Yazov was not receptive to proposals
from groups in various Soviet republics to allow soldiers to serve
only in their home regions. He said the draft ``would continue to
develop according to the principles of extra-territoriality.''

   Top administration officials insisted Sunday
that the Kremlin continues to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons,
although a published report said some deployments had been cut in
anticipation of an arms control deal.
   ``The fact of the matter is the Soviets have continued to
modernize their strategic forces,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press.''
   Cheney did not flatly deny a report published Sunday in The
Washington Post that quoted unidentified government sources as
saying the Soviets had stopped producing four new weapons, the
SS-18 and SS-24 missile, the Blackjack Bomber and the Typhoon
submarine, and had suspended work on an aircraft carrier.
   The Post said the reports, apparently based on satellite
photography, conflicted with recent statements by Cheney and Vice
President Dan Quayle that the Soviets continued to deploy new
weapons.

   Health-conscious Americans are on an oats kick
and U.S. farmers aren't keeping up with the demand.
   Oat bran has become ``a buzz word,'' says Agriculture Department
nutritionist Ruth H. Matthews. ``Everybody's got to have oat bran.
You've got to have oat bran in this and that. I've seen potato
chips with oat bran, and popcorn and everything else.''
   U.S. oats production rebounded this year from a drought-level
1988 output of 219 million bushels _ the lowest since the
Agriculture Department began records in 1866 _ to 371 million
bushels this year.
   But that won't be enough, and the United States will wind up in
1989-90 importing around 55 million bushels of oats. Last year,
when drought shriveled yields, imports jumped to 68 million bushels.
   Even before the current craze, the United States was importing
oats from Canada, Sweden, Finland and Argentina. Now the demand is
greater than ever.

   West Germany's president on Sunday urged Western
nations to help East Germany recover from the exodus of its
citizens, and the mayors of East and West Berlin shook hands in no
man's land to usher in a new era of relations.
   Another hole was cut through the Berlin Wall to the roaring
cheers of spectators. East Berliners continued to flood the western
half of the city, buying up anything they could afford with their
$55 of government ``welcome money.''
   By Sunday afternoon, Burger King was out of beer and Haagen-Daz
had sold all its ice cream bars.
   But amid the euphoria, there were reminders of the political
changes and uncertainty still sweeping through East Germany, which
opened its borders Thursday and began carving passages through the
29-mile-long Berlin Wall on Friday.

   Legendary Communist leader Dolores
Ibarruri, nicknamed ``La Pasionaria'' for her fiery oratory during
the Spanish Civil War, died Sunday. She was 93.
   Sources of the Ramon y Cajal hospital in Madrid said she died at
7:30 p.m.
   A member of the hospital's medical team, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said her death was due to ``pneumonia, aggravated by
her advanced age.'' At her bedside was her sole surviving child _
her daughter Amaya _ and other relatives.
   During the 1936 siege of Madrid by rebel forces led by Gen.

   A former savings and loan regulator who told
Congress he was pressured by five senators to go easy on one of
their major campaign contributors has been questioned by FBI agents
apparently looking into whether laws were violated, according to
published reports.
   Meanwhile, another newspaper said one of the five senators,
Democrat Alan Cranston of California, continued to intercede with
federal regulators on behalf of financier Charles H. Keating Jr.
for two years after auditors urged the takeover of Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   Edwin Gray, former head of the Home Loan Bank Board, told the
House Banking Committee last week that he was asked at an April 2
meeting with four of the five Senators to ease regulatory pressure
on Lincoln by dropping a rule barring the thrift's risky
investments.
   The four at the meeting were Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John
McCain, R-Ariz., Cranston, and John Glenn, D-Ohio. Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., has acknowledged making subsequent entreaties
on Keating's behalf, although he did not attend the meeting.
   Together, the five received $1.3 million in campaign
contributions from Keating, who has told reporters he certainly
hoped his contributions had bought influence with the senators.
   Although it is not clear when the FBI questioning reported by
The Boston Globe on Saturday and The Washington Post on Sunday
began, the chief of the Justice Department's public integrity
section wrote to Common Cause on Oct. 24 that the department would
thoroughly review the political watchdog's call for an
investigation into whether Keating's actions violated federal
election laws, or other laws.
   While declining to comment on whether the FBI is conducting an
investigation, a Justice Department official pointed out Sunday
that such interviews by agents would be normal practice in a
preliminary review of allegations that laws had been violated.
   The Globe's report Saturday quoted two ``well-placed sources''
as saying Gray was interviewed by agents last week and that Gray
declined to confirm whether he was questioned. The report did not
say whether the interviews took place before or after Gray's
congressional testimony.
   The Post account said other regulators also were questioned, but
did not say whether they were among those who also gave testimony
that backed up Gray's assertions to the House panel last week.
   All five of the senators have acknowledged taking campaign money
from Keating and interceding on his behalf. All five, likewise,
have denied any wrongdoing.
   The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News reported Sunday that Cranston
continued to intercede with Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall.
   The paper quoted Cranston's top aide, Roy F. Greenaway, as
acknowledging that the senator was pushing early this year for a
quick sale of Lincoln and said he did it because the sale would
have averted a taxpayer bailout of the thrift and would have taken
``Keating out of the savings and loan business'' even though
Keating would have remained an investor.

   The 46-member Organization of
Islamic Conference on Sunday asked all its member states to boycott
International Business Machines Corp. for its alleged plans to
supply Israel with computer technology that would help the country
make a hydrogen bomb.
   An OIC statement said the American computer company ``was
participating in the production of an advanced computer system for
Israel that will be used in its hydrogen bomb project and which
will also help in Israel's long and medium-range missiles.''
   The statement did not explain what led the organization to
believe the deal has been concluded. There have been reports that
IBM was only studying an Israeli request for the purchase of
sophisticated computers for academic purposes.
   A spokesman for IBM could not be reached for comment Sunday. A
person who answered the main number at the company's Armonk, N.Y.,
headquarters said he could not contact a spokesman.
   The statement from the Jiddah-based organization said ``such a
serious act'' will jeopardize the peace process in the Middle East
as well as international peace and security.
   The OIC has been emulating the pattern of the 22-member Arab
League in drawing up a blacklist of foreign companies whose
dealings with Israel it believes will help prop up the Jewish
state's economy or military effort.
   Arab press reports have said that the Arab League's boycott
office, which is based in Damascus, Syria, was checking on IBM's
alleged involvement in Israel's plans for manufacturing a hydrogen
bomb. The reports said the company will be blacklisted if the
cooperation became a fact.
   A U.S. government interagency team has been debating a
2-year-old request to grant licenses to export three supercomputers
to Israel.
   Arab press reports said the Israelis were interested in IBM and
Cray Research Inc. computers.

   Just who will be leading the nation's Big Three
automakers in the 1990s is clearing up, but only temporarily.
   Ford Motor Co. said last week that Vice Chairman Harold Poling
will become head of the nation's No. 2 automaker on March 1, when
Chairman Donald Petersen retires.
   But there's a catch of sorts. Poling, 64, will have the job for
just three years.
   ``That's kind of weird,'' analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. in New York said Friday after the
succession was announced. ``So much for the old, predictable Ford.''
   Most of the speculation centers on Allan Gilmour, who on Friday
was named the next president of Ford Automotive Group, the
company's vehicle-making operation.
   ``I think this (three years) is a period of time which the
company is going to use to groom Mr. Gilmour,'' said analyst Scott
Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   Succession speculation at Ford is likely to continue for the
next three years. It's a little clearer, at least for the long
term, at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
   In a reorganization announced earlier this year, Gerald
Greenwald was named a vice chairman at the No. 3 U.S. automaker,
making him the odds-on replacement for Lee Iacocca, whose contract
with Chrysler expires in early 1991.
   At GM, a board of directors' task force has been looking this
year for a successor to Chairman Roger Smith, who leaves office in
late 1990. GM President Robert Stempel has been mentioned as the
favorite, but some bets are being put on Executive Vice President
F. Alan Smith, no relation to the current chairman.
   In most discussions of succession in automakers' corner offices,
there's usually talk about whether the candidate is a ``car guy''
or a ``bean counter'' _ that is, an executive who came up through
the company's product or finance operations.
   At GM, the debate is clearest.
   Stempel, 56, joined the automaker's Oldsmobile Division as a
detailer in the chassis design department. He stayed in design or
engineering operations en route to heading up the
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group in January 1984 and moving on to
become the company's president and chief operating officer in
September 1987.
   Stempel refuses to talk about who the next chairman will be. GM
spokesmen set a ground rule for reporters wishing to interview
Stempel that no questions be asked about who will succeed the
chairman.
   Alan Smith, 58, was hired in June 1956 in the GM treasurer's
office in New York as a trainee and rose through the financial
sector, as did Roger Smith. Alan Smith became executive vice
president for finance in January 1981.
   Some of the blame for GM's falling market share has been laid on
Roger Smith for being too much of a ``bean counter'' and not enough
of a ``car guy.''
   Merlis said the nod should go to Stempel partly because GM's
board ``has taken so much abuse about finance guys being in there.''
   Most of Iacocca's early experience was in product development at
Ford before he joined Chrysler as president in 1978, when the
company faced bleak financial times.
   He led Chrysler's efforts to secure loans and federal guarantees
that eventually bailed out the company. Greenwald came to Chrysler
as the company's controller shortly after Iacocca did.
   There's a common element in each of the potential chairmen. Each
was in a leadership position when the auto industry took a serious
dive in the early 1980s. And each has had a hand in bringing the
Big Three back to profitability.
   ``All of the leadership in the auto industry,'' Merlis said,
``reached the top of the organizations when we had experienced the
worst automotive recession in postwar history.
   ``There's no better training than to drive through hell in an
automotive depression,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. has agreed to pay the state
$4 million for damage caused by the oil company's massive diesel
fuel spill south of Pittsburgh last year, according to a published
report.
   The agreement, not yet public, was expected to end extensive
negotiations between Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, The Pittsburgh
Press reported in Sunday editions.
   The payment would be for alleged violations of state
environmental laws and damage to drinking water, fish, waterfowl
and other resources in connection with the spill, which occurred
Jan. 2, 1988, at Ashland's Floreffe Terminal in Jefferson.
   More than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel flowed into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers when a storage tank ruptured.
   The spill killed thousands of fish and birds and forced public
water systems in three states to stop drawing from the the rivers.
   Charles Duritsa, a state environmental official involved in the
negotiations, confirmed the $4 million figure.
   Ashland also has agreed to reimburse Pennsylvania agencies for
overtime expenses, equipment purchases and other costs stemming
from the spill under a separate settlement reached several weeks
ago but not yet made public, the Press said.
   Officials told the newspaper that sum would be in the six-figure
range, but they would not be more specific.
   The settlement would bring to about $43.25 million the amount
Ashland has spent or commited itself to spend on spill-related
damage and expense claims by individuals, businesses and government
agencies, on civil penalties, for a criminal fine, for settlement
of a class-action suit and for the cleanup.
   The figure consists of about $14 million for damages, expenses
and civil penalties, including the $4 million Pennsylvania
agreement; $11 million for cleanup; $2.25 million for a criminal
fine; and up to $16 million under the terms of a class-action
settlement filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh last week.
   The costs have not have a significant impact on the company's
earnings, according to Ashland spokesman Robert Schrum. Ashland had
to pay a $2.5 million deductible, but insurance comvered the
balance of the damage and cleanup costs, he said.
