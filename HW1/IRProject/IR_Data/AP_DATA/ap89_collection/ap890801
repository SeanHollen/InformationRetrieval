   The feature race at Mehama's summer fest
wasn't exactly a display of blazing speed, but they didn't call it
the Slug and Scotch Broom Festival for nothing.
   Humor helped make up for the lack of action in the race
Saturday, in which the first of the critters to ooze its way out of
a ring was declared winner.
   ``He was going pretty fast, wasn't he?'' said Daniel Urquhart,
8, of Aumsville, whose slug crept to the championship.
   Rick Urquhart, father of the winning slug trainer, said he found
the racer at a state park.
   ``We definitely searched high and low for this one. We didn't
take any backyard varieties,'' he said. ``We'll probably retire
this one for the year. Maybe we'll catch the same one next year.''
   The festival, the town's first in 30 years, was the brainchild
of businessmen Mike Boyles and Bill Mercer, who came up with the
idea over a drink at Mercer's Fish Hatchery Tavern.
   ``I was talking about how I was glad scotch broom season was
over, and he said something about how slugs oughta be banned, and
it just came together,'' said Boyles. Scotch broom is a bushlike
weed with small yellow flowers that grows along roadways.
   ``I guess we were kind of bored,'' Boyles said.

   At 14 feet tall and 30 feet long,
Wilbir stands out from other peacocks.
   Of course, it's foliage, not plumage that Wilbir shows off, and
he can't strut around because he's a peat sculpture.
   With 2,000 begonias blooming on his chest, head and tail, he has
drawn some surprised looks at Michigan State University's new
Horticulture Demonstration Gardens.
   ``When I first saw it, I thought it was a dinosaur,'' said
Bobbie Haskell, who came for an evening walk in the gardens over
the weekend.
   ``We put in the peacock to get a little attention and show how
spectacular it's going to be,'' said Michigan State horticulture
Professor Will Carlson.
   Wilbir is short for ``Will's Bird,'' after Carlson, who is in
charge of the five-year project to construct the new garden.
   ``It will be a world-class garden. It will probably be one of
the finest in this country,'' he said.
   When finished in 1993, flowers will bloom over 7{ acres and
Wilbir will be the centerpiece of the garden's circular entrance
pavilion.

<HEAD>Primitive Cuban Painter Dead At 93</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Benito Ortiz, a Cuban who took up painting
after retiring as a letter carrier and gained renown for his
primitive scenes, is dead at the age of 93, the Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina reported.
   Ortiz died Saturday at his home in Sancti Spiritus, a city in
central Cuba, after a long illness that kept him away from his work
for almost a decade, the state-run news agency said Monday.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, did not name the illness.
   Ortiz took up painting ``to escape from boredom,'' he said, when
he retired after many years with the Cuban postal service.
   His colorful primitivist scenes of landscapes, picturesque
streets, plazas and houses in his former hometown of Trinidad
started to gain him stature throughout Latin America in the early
1960's.

<HEAD>Pro-Palestinian Song Disrupts Army General's Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular Israeli singer of Egyptian descent,
asked to entertain at an army general's going-away party, caused a
minor scandal by singing a song about the 19-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   The 20-year-old singer, Haya Samir, appeared on nationwide
television Monday to defend herself after newspaper reports said
her performance the previous night was met with boos and shouts
from an audience that included Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   The song she sang included such lines as ``those oppressed on
the road, ... prisoners of killing ... hungry for justice ...
chewing their hatred ... Mother Earth is bleeding, wounded by the
war, cursed by force and hatred.''
   Samir, who served in the army as a member of an entertainment
troupe, was invited because she was a favorite of Maj. Gen. Yitzhak
Mordechai, who was being honored with a party as he was transferred
from head of the army's southern command to head of central command.
   In the job he is leaving, Mordechai was responsible for putting
down the uprising in the occupied Gaza Strip. His new
responsibility will be the West Bank, also torn by the revolt
against Israeli occupation.
   The mass-circulation daily Maariv quoted one top officer as
remarking after the show: ``I am shocked. Yitzhak Mordecai loved
her singing and we wanted to give him a nice time. She used us.''
   According to the paper, Samir said after the party, ``I did not
intend to sing a political song. This is a song about life.''
   Speaking on Israel television Monday, she said the idea to sing
the controversial song, which she wrote herself, came to her as she
mounted the stage.
   Samir was born to Egyptian Moslem parents who immigrated to
Israel. Israeli newspapers said she was the only Arab woman to ever
serve in the army, though some Arab men regularly serve in the
Israeli military.

<HEAD>Vatican Seizes On Openings to Strengthen Church in Soviet Bloc</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of hostility, the Vatican is
seizing on what it calls a new spirit of cooperation by Moscow to
strengthen the Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet bloc.
   Over the past six months, the Vatican has succeeded in naming
new bishops in Lithuania and Czechoslovakia, forging diplomatic
ties with Poland after a 40-year lapse and nailing down a visit by
Pope John Paul II to Hungary.
   And last week, the Vatican named its first bishop in the Soviet
republic of Byelorussia since the aftermath of the Russian
Revolution.
   ``All the steps taken together are very important,'' said a
senior Vatican diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It
is an encouraging picture.''
   Vatican officials and independent analysts say progress is due
to the combination of openings provided by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and a pragmatic policy pursued by the pope, who as a
bishop in Poland had pursued a moderate but firm strategy for
religious freedom.
   ``The Vatican is aware of the new opportunities and is putting
out feelers in as many directions as it possibly can,'' said Dr.
John Eibner, head of Eastern European research at Keston College,
the British institute that monitors religious freedom around the
world.
   Not everything is rosy. Despite the appointments last week of
four bishops in Czechoslovakia, seven dioceses still lack bishops.
In Romania, there are no Eastern Rite Catholic bishops.
   In the Soviet Union, a major obstacle to improved relations
remains the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which was forcibly merged
with the Russian Orthodox Church under Josef Stalin in 1946.
   There is a strong underground Ukrainian church _ and Ukrainian
faithful have stepped up demands for recognition of their church _
but Vatican officials don't expect any immediate solution.
   Still, progress is unmistakable and has extended to Soviet
allies Cuba, which has agreed to a visit by the pope expected in
two years, and Vietnam, where a cardinal recently made the first
official visit by a Vatican representative since the Communist
takeover.
   The appointment of a bishop to Byelorussia is viewed as
particularly significant since it is uncontested Soviet territory.
The Vatican does not recognize the absorption of Lithuania by the
Soviet Union in 1940 and a Lithuanian exile mission is accredited
to the Holy See.
   In the case of Lithuania in March and in Byelorussia last week,
the Vatican informed the Kremlin of the decision to appoint a
bishop.
   ``These (authorities), in the new spirit established by the
Soviet government, politely let the holy father know they had no
difficulty in this regard,'' the Vatican said.
   Experts are divided over whether Moscow is sending out any
direct signals to its allies or whether it is a situation of the
winds of change blowing across borders and the church being seen as
a potential partner in helping to rebuild shattered economies.
   Analysts do agree that the potential of a church without leaders
was becoming increasingly embarrassing for the Prague government,
which has been widely criticized for religious repression.
   The Vatican has made public note of the changed attitude of the
Soviet leadership toward religion and has been encouraging contacts.
   Pravda, the Soviet party newspaper, said earlier this year that
``a bridge is being built from both sides.'' The commentary was in
marked contrast to accusations by Soviet news media in the early
80s that the pope and the church were interfering in Polish affairs.
   There is speculation that Hungary may be the next Warsaw Pact
country after Poland to establish diplomatic ties with the Holy
See. John Paul recently told a group of Hungarian pilgrims to
``prepare spiritually for my apostolic visit to Hungary within two
years.''
   How much progress is down the road could be answered when
Gorbachev visits Italy in November and is expected to see the pope.
   The meeting would be of historic proportions, the first between
the head of a Soviet party that disparages religion and the leader
of a church with 850 million followers.
   It was Stalin who cynically assessed the Roman popes' influence,
asking: How many divisions does the pope have?

   Before this week's report that Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins was hanged, at least eight other foreign kidnap
victims, including two Americans, had been killed by their
abductors in Lebanon.
   Here is a brief review:
   _William Buckley, 57, the CIA Beirut station chief, was
kidnapped March 16, 1984. The pro-Iranian Shiite group Islamic
Jihad claimed Oct. 4, 1985, it killed him, but no body was found.
On Jan. 20, 1987, Vice President George Bush confirmed that Buckley
had been killed. A bachelor from Medford, Mass., Buckley was
assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983.
   _Peter Kilburn, 62, of San Francisco, a librarian at the
American University of Beirut, disappeared Dec. 3, 1984, and was
found shot to death with two British hostages April 17, 1986. A
nearby note said a group called Arab Revolutionary Cells killed
them in retaliation for the U.S. air attack on Libya two days
earlier.
   _Leigh Douglas, 34, a British professor at the American
University of Beirut, disappeared March 28, 1986, in west Beirut.
He was found shot dead with Kilburn.
   _Philip Padfield, 40, a British language teacher, disappeared at
the same time as Douglas. He also was found dead with Kilburn.
   _Nicolas Kluiters, a Dutch Roman Catholic priest, disappeared in
eastern Lebanon March 14, 1985. His body was found strangled in the
area April 1, 1985.
   _Denis Hill, a Briton who taught English at the American
University of Beirut, failed to show up for work May 27, 1985, and
was found shot to death May 29, 1985.
   _Arkady Katkov, 32, a cultural attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Beirut, was abducted Sept. 30, 1985, with three other Soviet
diplomats and was found murdered Oct. 2 in a west Beirut suburb.
The three other Soviets were freed.
   _Michel Seurat, a French academic researcher, was kidnapped May
22, 1985. On March 5, 1986, an Islamic Jihad statement claimed
Seurat, 39, had been ``executed.'' His wife later confirmed that
French officials told her he was dead.
   In addition, the British Foreign Office says it also seeks word
on Alec Collett, a New York-based British journalist on assignment
with a U.N. relief agency who was kidnapped March 25, 1985, in
south Lebanon. His Palestinian abductors claimed April 23, 1986,
that they had killed him, but his body was never found.

hanging at 3 p.m. this Monday afternoon 28 Zul Hijja, 1409 Hegira,

   Death to America and Israel and the arrogant and their agents.
   Glory and immortality to the heroic and innocent martyrs of our

   President Bush, condemning the reported
hanging of Lt. Col. William Higgins by pro-Iranian kidnappers,
Monday night called on ``all parties'' holding hostages in the
Middle East to release them ``to begin to reverse the cycle of
violence.''
   In a statement telephoned to news organizations, Bush pointedly
renewed his criticism of Israel, whose kidnapping on Friday of a
Moslem Shiite cleric led Higgins' kidnappers to release a tape
which they said showed his execution by hanging.
   ``On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was not
helpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement,''
Bush said.
   ``Tonight I wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent call
to all, all parties, who hold hostages in the Middle East to
release them forthwith, as an humanitarian gesture, to begin to
reverse the cycle of violence in that region.''
   In his conference call to news agencies, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said it was ``impossible to tell'' what the
reaction to the president's statement would be.
   Asked if the U.S. government had contacted Israeli in an attempt
to persuade it to release its hostage, Fitzwater replied that ``We
have had contacts with Israel, but not in the past day.'' He did
not elaborate on the nature of the contacts.
   ``We face a very difficult situation,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
have threats of two other possible deaths. We have hostages being
held by a number of countries or factions or groups.
   ``The president feels his plea, with real attention focused on
the situation, could give everyone a chance to release their
hostages.''
   Fitzwater referred to threats made during the day by groups in
the Middle East against two hostages, Joseph James Cicippio, an
official of the American University of Beirut, and Anglican church
envoy Terry Waite.
   Earlier, referring to ``this brutal murder'' of the Marine
officer, Bush said: ``It is a most troubling and disturbing matter
that has shocked the American people right to the core. There is no
way that I can properly express the outrage that I feel.''
   While Bush cautioned publicly that he had no confirmation
Higgins had in fact been hanged, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said the president told congressional leaders Monday night
that ``it's about a 98 percent probability that it happened.''
   In the first reaction to Bush's call, Ehud Olmert, minister
without portfolio in the Israeli government, said on the ABC
``Nightline'' program he did not believe the president wanted
Israel to give up its hostage without a ``good chance'' of
obtaining the release of others thereby.
   ``I just don't believe that the president wanted to just draw a
comparison between Israel and these organizations _ to say, `You
did something wrong,' and `You did something wrong' and just
release all the hostages.
   ``I think the logic of what the president said is that Hezbollah
should release all the hostages, the American and Israeli hostages,
and in that case it is also wise to release (Sheik Abdul Karim)
Obeid,'' the Hezbollah leader kidnapped by Israeli commandos,
Olmert said.
   He defended the decision to kidnap Obeid on the grounds that
``We have tried all other ways. There came a time when we had to
decide whether we do something or just sit still'' against
terrorism.
   Bush monitored reports through the afternoon after returning
from Chicago, then met into the evening in the Cabinet room with
top advisers, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and other Cabinet members,
before briefing the congressional leaders.
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
said after that meeting that Bush was considering several options
but he declined to identify them.
   ``I don't think anything has been ruled out at this point,''
Boren said.
   During his earlier meeting with advisers, Bush ``received a
briefing on the status of our knowledge of the situation. This was
primarily an informational meeting at which all aspects of the case
involving Col. Higgins and the other hostages were discussed,''
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Higgins' reported killing triggered an instant debate in
Congress over Israel's role in the events. Israeli commandos
kidnapped a Shiite Moslem cleric last week, and the announcement of
Higgins' hanging said he was killed in retaliation.
   ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on behalf of the Israelis
would be refreshing,'' Dole said. But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
countered that blaming Israel would be ``turning the world on its
head.''
   At the White House, officials carefully avoided direct criticism
of Israel, but Fitzwater said, ``It is fair to say that many people
do share the senator's concerns.'' He would not elaborate.
   An Israeli official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``It's ridiculous to say that Israel is
responsible for Higgins' death. We don't even know if it's him, and
if it is, when he was killed.''
   A member of Congress who attended the leadership meeting with
Bush, speaking on condition of no further identification, said the
lawmakers were told repeatedly the United States was given no
notice of Israeli's intent to kidnap the cleric, and ``There was no
consultation between Israel and the United States.''
   After meeting with Bush, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said the president ``strongly reaffirmed his belief in the
appropriate policy of not negotiating with terorrists in any
circumstances.''
   He, like others at the meeting, declined to discuss which
possible responses _ including military options _ might be under
consideration.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said after the White House meeting: ``The
president made it very clear, until the facts are known, at least
more facts than we have now, there's no way you can make a
definitive decision'' on what to do.
   There are nine Americans in captivity in the Middle East,
including Terry Anderson, Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   ``Somehow there has got to be a return to decency and honor,
even in matters of this nature,'' Bush said on the White House lawn
after returning from Chicago, where he had addressed the National
Governors' Association.
   He also said he had spoken by telephone with Higgins' wife, ``a
wonderfully stoic individual who is going through sheer hell.''
   Bush cancelled appearances in Las Vegas and Oklahoma City.
   He learned of reports of the execution as he landed in Chicago.
   Higgins, 44, was serving as part of an international
peacekeeping force in Lebanon when he was taken captive in February
1988. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said they hanged him Monday
in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric. The
group released a videotape purporting to show the execution.
   Israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric, Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, and other Shiite Moslem captives for all
captured Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by Shiite
groups in Lebanon.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker, leaving Paris for Washington
after a weekend of meetings focusing on U.S.-Soviet relations and
the future of Cambodia., called the execution report ``outrageous
and uncivilized.''
   Dole said in Washington, ``I would hope the Israelis would take
another look at some of their actions that they must know in
advance would endanger American lives.''
   But Rep. Schumer said, ``Israel is among the few countries
seeking to fight terrorism. The blame has to fall on the terrorists
themselves.''
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., was circulating a letter asking
colleagues to support a resolution calling for the extradition of
Sheik Obeid to stand trial in the United States for the kidnapping
of Higgins.

   Sylvester Stallone says he isn't trying to avoid
romantic commitments because of his failed marriage to Brigitte
Nielsen. He just hasn't found the right girl.
   ``I need something like Sister Mary Theresa and Madam Curie and,
uh ... Irma La Douce, a little bit of everything,'' the actor said
in an interview to be broadcast on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
this week.
   Stallone says he appreciates ``the fair sex'' because women
``have a vast understanding of the way I think.''
   ``They are, by chemical composition, more emotional, so they
tend to be a little bit more compassionate, very work-oriented,''
he said. ``I think women strive very hard to show that they
certainly can carry on any endeavor that a man can. So I only
benefit by being surrounded by these kinds of people.''
   Stallone says he has pretty much recovered from his divorce from
Nielsen and isn't attempting to avoid any new commitment ``if that
comes along. I mean 'cause what really, what else is there?''

   Country singer Charlie Daniels says many
working people have had their fill with the state of the nation.
   ``People in this country are fed up,'' Daniels said during a
weekend concert appearance at Dodge City. ``I know because I talk
to people. I'm on the road all the time. I'm talking to the people
out there.''
   ``They're sick and tired of child abuse. They're sick and tired
of drugs. They're sick and tired of murders. They're sick, sick,
sick of it.''
   His band's appearance included the first concert performance of
a new song, ``Simple Man,'' title track from an upcoming album.
   ``We appeal to the blue collar people out there,'' Daniels said.
``They're the ones who make this country run. I think I can play
for them because I am a working man. I come from a long line of
farmers and timbermen. That's where my heart is, with those people
who get up in the morning and go to work.''
   At 52, Daniels says he feels more creative than ever.
   ``I thank God every day of my life that I enjoy the business I'm
in so much,'' he said. ``I'm going to keep doing this as long as I
can.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch has joined the list of
Leona Helmsley's detractors, calling the hotel queen ``the wicked
witch of the West'' for behavior unbecoming a billionaire.
   For ``a billionaire to be so chintzy, distresses people,'' the
mayor said Monday.
   The mayor emphasized that his opinion had nothing to do with
whether she is guilty of tax evasion, for which she is being tried
in federal court.
   ``That's for a jury to decide,'' he said, adding: ``It's just
her chintziness. It's a case involving the wicked witch of the
West.''
   Koch also commented on the justice system. ``Rich people hire
the best lawyers and therefore, they have better defenses,'' he
said. ``So in that sense there is an inequity. But rich people go
to jail.''
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, heads a $5 billion real estate and hotel
empire with her 80-year-old husband, Harry. She is accused of
evading taxes by disguising millions of dollars of renovations at
their Connecticut estate and other personal items as business
expenses. Her husband was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

   Chantal became the first hurricane of the Atlantic
season Monday as it bore down on Texas and Louisiana, thwarting
efforts to rescue the crew of a capsized oil rig and forcing
evacuation of a coastal island.
   The storm had strengthened rapidly after growing early Monday
from a tropical depression to a tropical storm. It had a maximum
sustained wind speed of 65 mph in early afternoon and increased to
75 mph, 1 mph over the threshold for reclassifying a tropical storm
a hurricane, by 6 p.m. EDT.
   Hurricane warnings were posted from Freeport, Texas, to Morgan
City, La.
   ``It's not going to be a major hurricane, but there will be
beach erosion, tides 10 feet above normal in some places and 10 to
15 inches of rain over Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texas,''
said Todd Kimberlain of the National Hurricane Center.
   The same area was deluged in late June by Tropical Storm Allison.
   According to the hurricane center, the hurricane's center's
likeliest landfall would be at 7 p.m. CDT Tuesday in the area of
Port Arther and Galveston, Texas.
   Forecasters said there was a 53 percent chance of the storm
centering on Port Arthur and a 52 percent chance of centering on
Galveston.
   The hurricane center emphasizes that its calculations are only
probablities based on previous storm tracks extrapolated from
Hurricane Chantal's current path.
   Squalls on the edge of the storm dumped heavy rain on New
Orleans and forced closure of the 24-mile long causeway across Lake
Pontchartrain.
   About 2,500 people on Grand Isle, a tiny resort area just off
the southeast Louisiana coast, were asked to go to the mainland.
Mayor Andy Valence said he feared Louisiana Highway 1, the only
route off the island, would flood.
   In southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish (county), civil defense
director Hayes Picou about 8,500 of the low-lying parish's 10,000
residents had evacuated the southern coast, most to stay with
friends or relatives.
   Two emergency shelters opened in nearby Lake Charles, with 67
Cameron residents staying in one shelter.
   ``These people are from Cameron. They've been through this more
than once. They brought all the necessities. Some brought TVs. Some
brought radios,'' said Nancy Cowan, Red Cross disaster chairman for
Calcasieu and Cameron parishes.
   Lutie Dyson, 62, said she and her husband, Clarence, 73, a
retired commercial fisherman, have frequently evacuated their homes
since June 1967, when Hurricane Audrey slammed ashore and killed
526 people, injured nearly 4,000, destroyed or damaged more than
2,500 homes and left millions of dollars in damage.
   ``I can't tell you exactly, maybe 10 or 12 times since Audrey,''
said Mrs. Dyson, a mother of 15 who lost her home to Audrey. ``If
they tell us to get out, we get out.''
   Told landfall was expected near Port Arthur, Mrs. Dyson replied:
``They told us that for Audrey, too, and we got Audrey. I pray it
doesn't hit anybody, but we have to take what God sends. We always
put the Lord on our side.''
   Heavy weather on the storm's fringe halted the search for 10 men
lost when an oil rig capsized while being moved south of Morgan
City. The Coast Guard flew divers to the rig despite 12-foot seas
and 60-mph winds.
   One man died after falling from a Chevron platform south of New
Orleans.
   At midnight EDT, the hurricane's center was near latitude 28.1
north and longitude 93.1 west, or about 130 miles southeast of
Galveston. It was moving north-northwest at 10 mph and forecasters
expected it to continue to gain strength and follow that
northwesterly path into midday Tuesday.
   ``This should bring the center over the upper Texas or western
Louisiana coast tomorrow afternoon or evening,'' said Bob Sheets,
the hurricane center's director.
   Sheets said tropical storm force wind extended outward 150 miles
to the north and 125 miles to the south of the center. A few
tornadoes were also likely over sections of Louisiana and extreme
eastern Texas during the night and Tuesday, he said.
   Texans also began girding for the hurricane while oil companies
removed hundreds of workers from rigs and platforms in the Gulf.
   ``We've evacuated everybody,'' said Conoco Inc. spokesman
Michael O'Connor. ``Our production is automated. We've set them on
timers.''
   ``We're planning for the worst and hoping for the best,'' said
Doug Matthews, city manager of Galveston, an island city of 60,000
just south of Houston.
   ``The old bugaboo is where this baby is going to hit,'' said
John Jamison, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Galveston.
   Chantal, the third named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane
season, formed earlier Monday from the season's fourth tropical
depression in the south-central Gulf.
   Meanwhile, in the open Atlantic, tropical depression No. 5 had
become Tropical Storm Dean by 11 p.m. EDT. It had top sustained
winds of 40 mph and was centered near latitude 15.5 north and
longitude 47.8 west, or about 850 miles east of the Lesser Antilles.
   It was moving west at about 15 mph, and was expected to gain
strength but hold its course, forecasters said.
   Two other depressions have formed into named storms since the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season began June 1.
   In addition to Tropical Storm Allison, Storm Barry lived briefly
in the open Atlantic in mid-July before being downgraded to a
tropical depression and dissipating.

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut Won't Increase Revenue, Opponents Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed cut in the
capital-gains tax won't increase government revenue any more than
did President Reagan's big tax reduction in 1981, says a coalition
of liberal organizations.
   ``It's just like 1981 _ Republicans and conservative Democrats
proposing to cut taxes to balance the budget,'' said Robert
McIntyre, executive director of the labor-financed Citizens for Tax
Justice.
   Rather than boost revenue, McIntyre told a news conference
Monday, the proposed reduction in capital-gains taxes would cost
the government more over the next decade than would the bailout of
the savings and loan industry or the purchase of the B-2 stealth
bomber.
   McIntyre was joined at a news conference by Joan Claybrook,
president of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen organization, and Robert
Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities.
   Bush contends that cutting the capital-gains tax would produce
greater revenue by spurring investment, even though his Treasury
Department forecasts a $20 billion revenue loss in 1994 through
1996. The experts who advise Congress say that after a one-year
gain of $4 billion, a cut would result in permanent revenue losses
reaching as high as $11.4 billion in 1996.
   Meantime, two economists writing for the Institute for Research
on the Economics of Taxation concluded that a capital-gains
reduction would be good even if it did not boost revenues.
   ``A capital-gains tax cut is likely to help people in all income
classes by spurring economic growth,'' wrote Michael Schuyler and
Roy E. Cordato. ``It would ease the income tax bias against saving
and toward immediate consumption.''
   Those are the same arguments Bush made in asking Congress to tax
capital gains at a lower rate than applies to wages. Democrats are
fighting the plan on grounds 80 percent of the benefit would go to
those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Nevertheless, 13 Ways and Means Republicans and six Democrats _
a majority for the panel _ are supporting a substitute plan by Rep.
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., that would cut the 33 percent maximum capital
gains rate to 19.6 percent for two years. It then would be raised
to 28 percent and investors would be protected against taxation on
gains caused solely by inflation.
   House Democratic leaders, attempting to block passage of the
Jenkins plan, are negotiating with Bush aides on the idea of
writing the inflation protection into law without cutting the
capital-gains rate.
   McIntyre said such a change, known as indexing, still would
amount to a tax reduction for holders of capital gains, and could
easily be manipulated. With indexing, he said, ``you just cash in
the assets that indexing helps and hold on to those that aren't
helped.''
   Greenstein called any capital-gains reduction an enormous
windfall for the wealthy.
   Ms. Claybrook said Bush's ``claim that lower capital-gains
(taxes) would stimulate new savings and venture capital is
nonsense.''
   After cuts in 1978 and 1981, she said, savings plummeted to
historic lows. Besides, Ms. Claybrook said, ``Virtually all venture
capital funds today come from tax-exempt pension funds and other
institutional investors for whom the lower capital-gains tax
provisions provide no benefit.''
   She said also that if capital gains are taxed at a lower rate
than wages, ``our tax code would once again be haunted by all
manner of unproductive tax shelters that are not profitable without
the tax benefits _ equipment leasing, billboards, oyster beds, and
llama breeding _ created to convert ordinary income into capital
gains.''

<HEAD>Monthly Index Shows Prices Decline for July</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department's monthly index
shows prices farmers received for raw products dropped 0.7 percent
in July from a month earlier, but were up 2.8 percent from a year
ago.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report Monday that declining prices for oranges,
broilers, soybeans and corn were partially offset by higher prices
for potatoes, cotton, tomatoes and hogs.
   The July index of prices paid for commodities and services,
interest, taxes and farm wage rates was 178 percent of its 1977
average. The index was 0.6 percent above April and 3.5 percent
above July 1988.
   ``Higher prices during July for feeder cattle and calves,
gasoline and building materials were partially offset by lower feed
prices,'' the report said.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products as a group declined 0.6 percent from June to
July but still averaged 6.1 percent above last year's figure.
   Overall crop prices declined 2.9 percent from last month and 2.2
percent from July 1988.
   The all-fruit index was down 20 percent from last month and 19
percent from a year ago.

   The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it's
working on a way to find out how much soil is blowing in the wind.
   By the mid-1990s, the department's scientists plan to have a
wind erosion computer system to help make daily estimates of soil
losses from wind erosion, says Lawrence J. Hagen, an agricultural
engineer with the USDA's agricultural research service.
   ``The system should also be helpful for managing rangelands and
croplands in humid as well as dry areas,'' he said.
   In the future, according to Hagen, the wind erosion system could
be linked to other computers to help compute the effects of dust on
the acid rain process, calculate economic costs of erosion and
assess management strategies for public lands.
   The USDA says semi-arid to humid croplands outside the Great
Plains often threatened by wind erosion include much of the
southeastern seaboard; sandy and organic soil areas of Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota; lakebed soils of Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota
and North Dakota; the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest and
several irrigated valleys of California.

   Rotating grain crops, such as corn with
alfalfa, is a key strategy for sustaining agriculture in the long
run, according to a new study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and Cornell University scientists.
   ``Crop rotation may be the answer to sustaining long-term
productivity of our land to provide billions of people with food,
fuel and other renewable resources,'' says Gary H. Heichel, a plant
physiologist with the USDA's agricultural research service.
   He says the study analyzes energy uses of various farming
systems, including continuous corn crops and various rotations of
grain and legume crops. Continuous corn can be highly productive
with the use of nitrogen fertilizer, he says, adding ``but is of
dubious sustainability because of high fossil fuel use and soil
erosion.''
   ``On the other hand,'' Heichel said, ``legumes are among the
most efficient crops grown in the United States, partly because
little fuel is required to grow them. Also more energy is embodied
in farming equipment needed to grow other crops such as corn.''
   More than 3 million calories of fossil fuel energy normally are
required to produce nitrogen fertilizer for an acre of corn grown
under a continuous cropping program, said David Pimentel, an
ecologist and entomologist at Cornell University. ``But a crop
rotation that alternates one crop of soybeans, which normally
requires no nitrogen fertilizer, with two crops of corn could
reduce fossil energy use by 26 percent.''

<HEAD>Congress Considers Paying for Renovation of Quayle Residence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress may provide taxpayer money to remodel
Vice President Dan Quayle's official residence to accommodate his
family, despite earlier plans to fund the work with private
donations.
   About $200,000 in private money raised to pay for the
renovations may be used instead for decorating, said Denise
Balzano, chief of staff to Quayle's wife, Marilyn.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee, said Monday he
will ask the Bush administration to justify the use of public money
when his panel works on spending legislation this week.
   ``Assuming they can justify it, and that's a reasonable
assumption, the federal government should pay for it,'' DeConcini
said.
   The House voted Friday to provide $200,000 for the renovation as
part of $18.4 billion approved for treasury and postal programs for
fiscal 1990. The planned remodeling of the third floor of the
Victorian mansion would create separate bedrooms for the Quayles'
three children and other rooms as well.
   The Quayles' children _ Tucker, 15, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne,
10 _ live on the top floor of the three-story building, which is on
the rolling grounds of the Naval Observatory in northwest
Washington and was built in 1894. The structure, on the exclusive
``Embassy Row'' section of Massachusetts Avenue, has been the
official residence of the vice president since 1975.
   Last November, shortly after President Bush and Quayle were
elected, the Quayles said the mansion would need work to make it
meet the family's needs. They moved into the mansion in February.
   Balzano said a group of Mrs. Quayle's friends offered to raise
the money for the renovation, and about $200,000 in donations were
collected. The Quayles also informed Congress of the work, she said.
   ``We felt it was important they be kept informed of what we were
doing, since it is a government building,'' Balzano said. The idea
for providing public money for the work came from the House
Appropriations Committee, she said.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee, which authored the
House-passed spending bill, said Mrs. Quayle invited them to visit
the mansion and examine the needed work.
   ``We didn't plan to put it into this budget,'' Roybal said in an
interview. ``She called our attention to it.''
   The lawmakers decided to provide money after receiving a report
from subcommittee staff saying the renovation was needed, said
Roybal.
   None of the work has been done. Balzano said plans call for the
construction of four bedrooms, a family room, an office for Mrs.
Quayle, three bathrooms and a room for a washer and dryer.
   The first floor of the mansion is used largely for entertaining,
while the second floor has a master bedroom and a guest room.

<HEAD>Explorers Looking For Ice-Buried World War II Planes Return With
Pieces</HEAD>

   A group of explorers returned from a journey to
the polar icecap with two bits of metal from the wing of a World
War II bomber _ treasures retrieved from under 250 feet of ice.
   Pat Epps and other members of the Greenland Expedition Society
suffered hunger, cold and sunburn in the hunt for the ``lost
squadron,'' eight aircraft which crash landed in Greenland in 1942.
   ``This is the first time someone brought back tangible evidence
of these aircraft,'' said Epps, owner of Epps Aviation at suburban
DeKalb Peachtree Airport, where the expedition returned in a DC-3
Monday.
   The group left Georgia on July 7 seeking proof to back up sonar
scans made in 1988 that showed the aircraft buried under four
decades of ice and snow.
   The planes are a pair of B-17 bombers Epps said were worth
$400,000 to $800,000 apiece if made airworthy, and six P-38
Lightnings, twin engine fighters Epps said were worth $600,000 to
$1.2 million each.
   They were flying to England in 1942 when they were forced down
by bad weather. The crews later were rescued.
   Epps' recovery team spent 17 days on the icecap. Storms grounded
their plane for days and trapped the men in their tents.
   ``We were there six days unsupported,'' said society co-leader
Richard Taylor, an Atlanta architect. ``We ran low on fuel. We ate
just one meal a day. We had very little food. We'd run the
generator just enough to send radio messages. They were very
brief.''
   ``We'd play hearts for hours at a time,'' said Atlanta
businessman Neil Estes.
   The explorers used two steam drills to bore 250 feet through the
glacier to a B-17 nicknamed ``Big Stoop.'' Then they lined the
three-inch hole with plastic pipe and lowered a hand-held coring
drill to cut pieces of the plane's metal skin and what appeared to
be a piece of an oil tank in the wing behind an engine.
   ``It's still got oil or hydraulic fluid on it,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor said there was no evidence of the kind of shifting of
different layers of ice in the glacier that could have destroyed
the planes.
   Epps credited Norman Vaughan, 83, of Trapper Creek, Alaska, the
last man to see the planes, with keeping the expedition's hopes
alive.
   Vaughan, a dog musher and Army Air Force officer, was sent by
dogsled in 1942 to make sure top-secret bombsights on the bombers
were destroyed or brought back.
   Vaughan told Epps about the planes eight years ago, and was part
of Epps' recovery team, handling an assortment of duties including
camp cook.
   The three-week expedition cost about $150,000, and Epps said the
Greenland Expedition Society would have to raise somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million for an expedition to last all next
summer to recover the planes.
   He hopes to sink a shaft to the planes that is large enough to
remove the planes in pieces.
   Epps wants to fly at least one of the planes off the ice.

   U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch, suspected of
spying for the Soviets, sipped grapefruit juice and calmly watched
for 45 minutes as a foreign correspondent showed him videotapes and
clippings of how his story is being told in his native Austria.
   ``I tried and tried, but he said he wouldn't answer questions on
the substance of his case,'' said Robert Weisner, the Washington
correspondent for state-run Austrian television. He said Bloch
looked ``rather surprisingly relaxed'' Monday, as he sipped juice
and watched videotapes of the Bloch story prepared for Austrian
television.
   Bloch also read Austrian newspaper accounts of the case, which
Weisner showed him during Bloch's 45-minute visit to the offices of
Austrian television Monday afternoon in the Georgetown section of
the capital.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department, in its first public statement
on the case, expressed concern that its investigation may have been
hurt by premature disclosure and acknowledged objecting to the
State Department's confirmation of the investigation on July 21.
   On his first day back in the nation's capital after more than a
week in the New York City area, Bloch emerged alone from the back
door of his apartment in the fashionable Kalorama section and
strolled to Georgetown.
   He wore a blazer, with a furled umbrella hung over his left
wrist.
   Bloch was followed by about 15 people, including reporters and
photographers, two cars with television cameramen _ being driven so
slowly that traffic was stopped _ and a car containing two
grim-faced men, presumably agents for the FBI.
   To reporters who queried him along the way, Bloch said, ``I'm
hardly a free man, you know. ... I'd love to put it behind me.''
   The 54-year-old diplomat was placed on paid leave by the State
Department on June 22. His diplomatic passport has been revoked,
but he has not been charged with any crime. He is followed any time
he goes out by FBI agents and reporters.
   At the Austrian television office, Bloch asked Weisner how the
Austrian media were covering his case, wanting to know how he was
being perceived by the public in his native country, Weisner said.
Bloch was the No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna until
two years ago.
   Weisner said he managed to reach Bloch by telephone Monday and
``asked him if he wanted to come and talk and see what Austrian
television reported on his case.''
   Bloch replied that he was coming to Georgetown on other business
and would be willing to stop in. From there, he went to his
lawyer's office.
   Bloch returned to Washington after spending more than a week
with his father in Manhattan and his daughter in suburban
Chappaqua, N.Y.
   At the Justice Department, Runkel said news reports that began
with an ABC News segment July 21 may have hurt the FBI's ability to
collect evidence against Bloch.
   ``You could say we have a concern that the premature disclosure
of the matter may have had an adverse effect on the gathering of
information,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel also said ``there were some concerns expressed by the
(Justice) department'' before the State Department issued a
statement July 21 confirming it was cooperating with an FBI
investigation of ``illegal activities'' by Bloch ``involving a
foreign intelligence service.''
   Government sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said
the FBI has a videotape of Bloch passing a briefcase to a KGB agent
in Paris earlier this year, but that the government does not have
enough evidence to charge him with espionage.
   To bring an espionage case, the Justice Department must have
evidence that specific classified information was passed to a
foreign power and that the material's release damaged national
security.
   The bureau believes Bloch was recruited 14 years ago by the
Soviets when he was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin,
according to a congressional source.

<HEAD>Biden: Bush Breeding Cynicism in War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is breeding cynicism in the war
on drugs by calling for laws that already are on the books and
failing to seek full funding of drug legislation, says the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``The war of words, what has it wrought?'' asked Sen. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del. ``What it has wrought so far is cynicism,
political opportunism, and some despair.''
   Bush ``is able to stand up at his inauguration and say, `This
scourge will end,' and then have no one `call' him when he refuses
to use the tools already available to him to fight the war on
drugs,'' Biden said Monday in a speech at the National Press Club.
   Bush sought to cut $10 million in funds for the Law Enforcement
Training Institute at Glynco, Ga., even as he traveled there to
praise the institute and call for new anti-crime legislation, Biden
said.
   Among the laws sought by Bush that Congress already has passed,
Biden contended, are longer sentences for drug dealers, the death
penalty for some drug dealers, minimum prison terms for weapons
offenders and preventive detention for people arrested with drugs.
   Congress passed such laws in 1984, 1986 and 1988, ``all by
bipartisan support, and neither party in Congress at the time tried
to take political advantage for them having been passed,'' Biden
said.
   Alixe Glen, a White House spokeswoman, said, ``The crime package
that the president sent to the Hill is a decisive, effective and
achievable package, and it is a very comprehensive program to
combat crime.
   ``Bush's plan doubles the mandatory penalty for the use of a
semiautomatic weapon, completely reforms plea-bargaining
practices,'' she said. ``The death penalty may be a law on the
books, but the procedures necessary to implement the death penalty
would be activated by Bush's plan.''
   In addition, she said, the package adds nearly 1,000 federal
agents to law enforcement agencies.
   Biden said the 1988 anti-drug legislation called for the
addition of almost 3,000 agents to federal law enforcement agencies
and for treatment beds for nearly 250,000 addicts.
   ``But in 1989, Mr. President ... you failed to put in your
budget the money need to make these tough laws work,'' Biden said.
``You didn't even ask for them to be funded after you praised them
in the election campaign.''
   Biden said $1.8 billion must be found in the current fiscal year
to fully fund the 1988 anti-drug bill, even if it means raising
taxes to pay for it. By contrast, he noted, the bailout plan for
the savings and loan industry will cost several billion dollars,
and each B-2 bomber sought by the administration costs $530 million.
   Larry Cirignano, a spokesman for William J. Bennett, director of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said after the speech
that he had no comment on the remarks.

   Here is the text of President Bush's statement
calling for the release of hostages in the Middle East:
   Our grave concern over the taking and holding of American
citizens as hostages has been made clear on numerous occasions in
the past.
   On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was not helpful
to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic events of
today have underscored the validity of that statement.
   That position, and our firm opposition to negotiating with
hostage takers, was further reinforced in my discussions this
evening within the administration and in consultations with the
congressional leadership.
   Tonight I wish to go beyond that statement with an urgent call
to all, all parties, who hold hostages in the Middle East to
release them forthwith, as a humanitarian gesture, to begin to
reverse the cycle of violence in that region.

   Gains made by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in weekend talks with his Soviet and Chinese counterparts
are being overshadowed by the reported execution of an American
hostage in Lebanon.
   Baker returned from Paris on Monday night, indicating he was
pleased that U.S. relations with the Soviet Union had edged up a
few notches and that high-level contacts with China had been
re-established.
   But he was at a loss about how to cope with a resurgence of
terrorism that apparently led to the death of Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, and threatens other American hostages in
Lebanon.
   Apart from denouncing Higgins' kidnappers as ``outrageous and
uncivilized,'' Baker gave no hint that the Bush administration had
yet found an effective strategy for coping with its first major
foreign policy challenge.
   Before leaving Paris, Baker asked Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze to do what he can for the American hostages when he
visits Tehran.
   Using the Paris peace conference on Cambodia as a backdrop,
Baker began plotting with Shevardnadze the first summit meeting
between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A Soviet observer called the meeting a ``shirt-sleeve'' session
at the Soviet embassy that ran three hours and 10 minutes.
   Officials on both sides said Baker and Shevardnadze disagreed
sharply over Afghanistan, but otherwise found rapport. The Soviets
are irked about continuing U.S. weapons shipments to rebels trying
to dislodge a pro-Moscow government in Kabul.
   Baker invited Shevardnadze to Wyoming for a Sept. 19-20 meeting
on the planned summit.
   Baker seized the opportunity at the Paris conference to
re-establish high-level contacts with China after a lapse of nearly
two months following the violent repression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   Baker met for 90 minutes with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen with
only interpreters present.
   Baker told Qian that ``repression on the part of the People's
Republic of China would not be understood by the American people,''
a senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
after the meeting.
   ``It was our view that if China does want to continue its
reform, as it says it does, it ought not to turn inward and isolate
itself through conduct that would not be understood by many in the
international community,'' the official said.
   Following the Tiananmen Square shootings of Chinese protesters,
Bush barred exchanges of senior U.S. and Chinese officials as well
as high-level visits to China. However, Baker's meeting with Qian
was considered outside the bounds of the sanctions.
   His aim was to assure Qian that the administration wants to
preserve strong ties with Beijing, but ``we are going to need
help,'' the official said.
   The two governments found a common interest on Cambodia. Both
want to see Vietnamese troops leave by the end of September and a
U.N. observer force supervising a cease-fire in the war between
guerrillas and the Hanoi-installed government.
   The Chinese want a role for the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian
faction backed by Beijing that is accused of murdering more than 1
million Cambodians between 1975 and 1978. Baker wants the Khmer
Rouge shut out.

   The yellow ribbons around the trees that
shade William Richard Higgins' first school are tattered and fading
after 17 months, much like local hopes that he would survive his
captivity in Lebanon.
   Two blocks north of Lancaster Elementary School, the red brick
house that was his first home stands vacant and decaying, a
poignant reminder of reports that Higgins' captors had hanged the
Marine lieutenant colonel.
   ``It's a sad day _ sad for everybody in the country and a sad
day for Lancaster,'' said Doris Spurlin, who like other merchants
here had decked the door of her dress shop with a yellow ribbon.
   ``Everybody had been so hopeful that he would get out,'' she
said Monday.
   Higgins, 44, was seized while assigned to a United Nations
peacekeeping force. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems claimed Monday to
have executed him in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a
Moslem cleric. The group released a videotape purporting to show
the execution.
   Higgins' wife, Robin, said in a statement released in Washington
by her attorney, Gregory Craig, that she did not know if the
reports were true.
   ``One thing I have learned over the past 17 months is that the
truth is hard to find, and it remains so,'' said Mrs. Higgins, 37,
who is a major inthe Marine Corps and works at the Pentagon as a
public information officer.
   Mrs. Higgins did not come to work Monday, but arrived at the
building at midmorning with Higgins' 19-year-old daughter, Chrissy.
They remained secluded, out of reporters' sight.
   In her statement, Mrs. Higgins urged Americans not to draw any
premature conclusions ``during this terrible time of uncertainty.''
She also appealed to the captors in Lebanon to ``put an end to this
needless cycle of violence and victimization by releasing my
husband right now and sending him home.''
   Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry Anderson, urged American
officials to respond cautiously to Higgins' reported death.
Anderson, the longest-held hostage, is Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press.
   ``What we have witnessed, in the Israeli retaliation in kind for
the kidnapping of their people, (is) that violence truly does beget
violence and that I hope the United States will use this
opportunity for reconciliation rather than retaliation,'' Mrs. Say
said in an interview from her home near Cadiz in western Kentucky.
   ``An eye for an eye only leaves both sides blind.''
   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher, said from her home in the
Louisville suburb of Okolona that she believed Higgins' was dead
before she saw the videotape.
   ``How can I doubt it,'' said Mrs. Fisher, adding that she was
angry because ``the government has not done what it should have
done to get him out.''
   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who attended church in south
Louisville with Higgins in the 1950s, recommended he be given the
nation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor.
   ``Regardless of Higgins' fate, he deserves it,'' the Kentucky
Republican said.
   McConnell's Democratic counterpart, Wendell Ford, called upon
President Bush to ``take immediate retaliatory action.''
   ``Just issuing a statement of protest isn't going to cut it,''
Ford said. ``We've had Americans now in captivity for years, and
this heinous act should motivate us to make an extra effort to get
our remaining hostages released.''
   Bush Monday night called on ``all parties'' holding hostages in
the Middle East to release them ``to begin to reverse the cycle of
violence.''
   In Texas, meanwhile, two men who were Marine academy classmates
of Higgins started a scholarship fund for his daughter. ``Short of
getting on our old gear and going to find the guys that hung him,
we decided to do something for his kids,'' said G.S. ``Sky'' Page,
who chipped in $250 along with Greg Mullen.
   Lancaster, a farming town of 3,400, claims Higgins as a native
son although he was born a county away in Danville, which had the
nearest hospital, and grew up mainly in Louisville.
   Higgins lived here only through the first grade, but both lines
of his family _ the Higginses and the Eagles _ were
well-established, said Marguerite Whittaker, co-owner and managing
editor of Lancaster's 100-year-old weekly newspaper, The Central
Record.
   Although few townspeople knew Higgins personally, ``they have
been concerned,'' Mrs. Whittaker said.
   Higgins' family called him Richard, perhaps to avoid confusion
with his father, Billy Higgins, an accountant.
   Billy Higgins died in Louisville and was brought here for burial
in the Lancaster Cemetery beside his wife, Ethel Eagle Higgins, on
Feb. 20, 1988 _ three days after his son's abduction.

<HEAD>Administration Willing to Consider S&amp;L Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is willing to discuss
a compromise on financing the president's savings and loan bailout,
but won't consider any plans offered so far, a senior Treasury
official says.
   Under Secretary for Finance Robert R. Glauber, in an interview
Monday, said a compromise would be considered if it doesn't
undermine the spending discipline imposed by the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law.
   ``Whether there is something else lurking out there that would
preserve what is important to the administration, which is the
integrity of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings process ... is the issue,''
he said.
   ``We're certainly prepared to look at what somebody could come
up with.''
   A House-Senate conference committee last week agreed to finance
the multibillion-dollar bailout ``on budget,'' a plan favored by
Democrats. The plan would balloon the federal budget deficit but
waive automatic spending cuts that would be triggered under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The administration favors an ``off-budget'' funding mechanism
that would avoid automatic spending cuts by keeping S&amp;L spending
out of the deficit.
   President Bush argues that his way of evading Gramm-Rudman,
although somewhat more expensive than the Democratic plan, is
harder to duplicate and would be less likely to encourage a
congressional spending spree.
   The full House and Senate are scheduled to vote on the
conference committee bill this week, with House action expected by
Thursday and a Senate vote a day later.
   The dispute appears to be a stalemate. Democrats have enough
votes to block the president's financing plan in the House and
probably in the Senate. Republicans say they can muster 41 votes in
the Senate in support of the president, enough to block the
Democratic plan under that chamber's rules.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is leading the effort to protect
the deficit law that bears his name, said he's ``given some
thought'' to a compromise but doesn't hold out much hope.
   ``If there's a magic solution, I haven't come up with it,'' he
said. ``The question is, are we going to destroy the budget process
in the process of passing the S&amp;L bill? The answer to that is yes
or no. You can't say you're going to destroy it a little bit.''
   Democrats will be unwilling to consider a compromise until
Senate Republicans prove they can block the Democratic plan, he
said.
   Glauber rejected compromise proposals that have been publicly
offered so far.
   ``If we could find some way to ... make the precedent less easy
to copy, then we've got the basis for a compromise,'' he said.
   One type of compromise, advanced earlier by Rep. Chalmers Wylie,
R-Ohio, and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., is a hybrid, with some
spending on budget and some off, which Glauber said is little
better than the Democratic plan.
   Another type of plan, first advocated by Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, doesn't
waive Gramm-Rudman. Instead, it evades automatic spending cuts by
loading all of the spending into fiscal year 1989. The deadlines
that would trigger automatic spending cuts already have passed for
that year.
   However, Glauber said that would make Gramm-Rudman
``meaningless.''
   On a related topic, Glauber said the administration may appoint
an interim director to run the Resolution Trust Corp., the new
agency that will oversee the disposal of failed S&amp;Ls. If a
permanent director can't be found immediately, the administration
may temporarily appoint someone already serving in the government,
he said.

   Tales of two odd couples _ ``Turner and Hooch''
and ``Lethal Weapon 2'' _ topped the box-office charts, while
``Batman'' swooped past the $200 million mark.
   The Disney comedy ``Turner and Hooch,'' pairing Tom Hanks with a
slobbering dog named Beasely, collected $12.2 million in its first
weekend, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Disney claimed three of the other Top 10 spots with ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Peter Pan'' for a
total take of $21.8 million. It was among the best weekends in the
studio's history and the first time this year that one company has
had four films on the leader board, Disney officials said.
   In second place was ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action sequel
starring Mel Gibson as the manic partner of straight-arrow cop
Danny Glover. The film grossed $10.4 million and shows few signs of
fading away.
   The summer's most popular title, ``Batman,'' had receipts of $9
million and now has made $202.9 million. As of this week, it is the
ninth biggest hit in Hollywood history, and the first film to crack
the all-time Top 10 since ``Back to the Future'' in 1985.
   ``Batman'' now seems likely to pass such other megahits as
``Ghostbusters'' ($220 million), ``Beverly Hills Cop'' ($234
million), and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' ($242 million).
   In fourth place with $7.9 million was the romantic comedy ``When
Harry Met Sally...,'' featuring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as best
friends who over a dozen years come to be lovers. It was followed
by the return of ax-wielding Jason Voorhees in ``Friday the 13th
Part VIII,'' with $6.3 million.
   In sixth was the family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,''
starring Rick Moranis, with ticket sales of $4.6 million. The
latest James Bond film, ``Licence to Kill,'' finished in seventh
with $3.4 million.
   Director Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' continued to chug along in eighth place, collecting $2.8
million. Rounding out the weekly Top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society''
in ninth with $2.6 million and ``Peter Pan'' in 10th with $2.3
million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Turner and Hooch,'' Disney, $12.2 million, 1,877 screens,
$6,506 per screen, $12.2 million, one week.
   2. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner Bros., $10.4 million, 1,830
screens, $5,684 per screen, $88.8 million, four weeks.
   3. ``Batman,'' Warner Bros., $9 million, 2,201 screens, $4,068
per screen, $202.9 million, six weeks.
   4. ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' Columbia, $7.9 million, 872
screens, $9,013 per screen, $24.2 million, three weeks.
   5. ``Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,''
Paramount, $6.3 million, 1,683 screens, $3,714 per screen, $6.3
million, one week.
   6. ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' Disney, $4.6 million, 1,481

<HEAD>Diabetics Find Needle Disposal Tricky in the Age of AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Girls at a camp for diabetics once tossed used
syringes into empty milk containers that went to the dump. But fear
of AIDS has changed that, and the federal government is considering
how millions of other American diabetics should dispose of their
needles.
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' said Shelley Yeager, director of the
Clara Barton camp at Oxford in central Massachusetts. ``We've
really had to be very careful.''
   About 115 campers and counselors give themselves injections,
some as often as four times a day, Yeager said. In addition, the
camp uses about 600 lancets daily to test campers' blood sugar.
   There are an estimated 11 million diabetics nationwide, of whom
about 2.5 million give themselves insulin shots each day, said
Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer for the American
Diabetes Association in Alexandria, Va.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is working on a brochure
advising diabetics of the best way to dispose of needles, said
Robin Woods, a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, D.C.
   It will suggest that diabetics place ``sharps'' _ the needle end
of a syringe _ in a hard plastic or metal container like a coffee
can before throwing it in the trash, Woods said.
   The association recommends people dispose of the needle and
syringe ``in a way that it can't be used again,'' Kahn said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has heightened concern about
medical waste because the disease can be transmitted through
contaminated hypodermic needles. AIDS, which attacks the body's
immune system, also can be transmitted through sexual contact.
   The EPA drew up new rules on how hospitals dispose of medical
waste after many U.S. beaches were fouled last summer.
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has adopted new
regulations on the disposal of infectious waste that take effect
next week, but like the federal rules, they don't apply to
household waste, said the department's Al Comproni.
   The regulations require hospitals, doctors, funeral parlors and
other generators of infectious waste to either ship used needles to
certified waste disposal sites or sterilize them and grind them for
disposal in a solid waste landfill.
   The Clara Barton camp started changing its disposal methods
about two years ago as AIDS became a concern, Yeager said.
   All needles now are thrown in special plastic medical waste
containers placed around the camp. This year, the camp built a shed
on the soccer field just to house the disposable containers.
Doctors pick them up periodically and take them back to a hospital
where they are destroyed, Yeager said.
   The Becton Dickinson Co. of Franklin Lakes, N.J., donates the
needle containers, worth about $2 each. The camp uses about 20
containers a week, Yeager said.
   Some companies are considering offering disposal services to
individual diabetics.
   Becton Dickinson sells needle containers to doctors and
hospitals but may develop a container for home use, said Linda
Schmitt, an assistant product manager.
   ``There really hasn't been one designed for the consumers,''
Schmitt said.
   Medical Waste Disposal Co. of Randolph is preparing to offer a
home needle pickup service, said Debra Bornstein, a company
official. It plans to charge $20 for door-to-door pickup and
disposal.

   Hurricane seas forced rescue workers to stop
their search for 10 crewmen aboard a capsized offshore oil rig as
swells rose as high as 25 feet.
   The self-propelled rig Avco 5 with 14 people aboard was headed
to shore early Monday when it capsized about 20 miles off the
Louisiana coast, near Morgan City, Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa
said.
   Four of the 14 workers were plucked from the water by fishermen
and a Coast Guard helicopter, said Chief Petty Officer Michael
Robling.
   The rig, leased by Chevron from Avis Bourg Co. of Folsom, was on
its side in about 25 feet of water, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   Officials hoped survivors had found airpockets in the sealed
compartments on the rig, but Hurricane Chantal's 12-foot seas, 70
mph winds and heavy rains prevented divers from making a search.
   The dive boat and a Coast Guard cutter stood nearby, but the bad
weather forced helicopters back to shore.
   An air bubble trapped in watertight compartments would be the
only oxygen for any survivors, said Coast Guard Lt. Steve Hardy,
but he did not estimate how long any trapped crewmen could survive.
   Three survivors were taken aboard the fishing vessel Spar Royale
for a trip to Wine Island Pass, and one person was taken by
helicopter to Grand Isle, Hardy said. None of the four was
seriously injured, officials said.
   The Coast Guard said a search for the 10 missing workers would
be suspended indefinitely because of worsening conditions. Swells
25 feet high were reported in the area late Monday night.
   The missing workers were not immediately identified.
   Elsewhere, a second jackup rig, so called because the legs can
be jacked up to allow the rig to sail, was tilting at a 12-degree
angle and five workers were taken from it without injury, Hardy
said.
   The rig owned by Atlantic &amp; Pacific Marine Inc. of Houston, was
about 15 miles east of Grand Isle.
   A history of accidents involving jackup rigs, also called lift
boats, such as the one that capsized Monday prompted the Coast
Guard to start an inspection program last January, officials said.
Companies had until Monday to apply for an inspection; the owners
of the capsized rig had applied, officials said.
   ``What it boils down to is a record of casualities, including
fatalities that gets your attention. The number of lift boats
involved in accidents is higher than normal,'' said Lt. Allen
Harker, a marine inspector at the Coast Guard's 8th District
headquarters.
   Hardy said he wasn't aware of many accidents involving jackup
rigs when they are sailing. Past problems occurred mainly with
stationary rigs, he said.
   The Avco 5, a work rig about 72-feet long, is basica barge with
legs that extend 100 feet under water. The legs are lifted above
the vessel when it is under way.

   With little fanfare, the Justice Department is
departing from Reagan administration civil rights policies to
actively defend federal programs requiring set-aside contracts for
minority businesses.
   ``They are now, I'd say, aggressively defending the
constitutionality of the DOT program,'' said John Payton, a
Washington civil rights lawyer.
   The department's defense of two affirmative action programs for
highway construction financed with Transportation Department funds
signals a shift from the days of President Reagan's civil rights
chief, William Bradford Reynolds, according to lawyers familiar
with the cases.
   The department is distinguishing the federal programs from a
Richmond, Va., set-aside law that was declared unconstitutional in
January by the Supreme Court.
   The Justice Department asked a federal appellate court in March
to uphold Tennessee's highway set-aside program that it only
half-heartedly defended during the Reagan years, said Payton, who
is involved in the case.
   And in July, the department continued efforts to defend a
set-aside program for minority highway contractors in North
Carolina.
   ``I think there is a shift,'' said Barbara Arnwine, director of
the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ``But
undamentally they are only doing what they should be doing _ that
is defending the federal law.
   ``It's not like this is a radical departure from expectation,
they are fulfilling their obligation as the U.S. Justice Department
to defend federal programs that have tendorsement and approval and
the imprimatur of Congress.''
   The Reagan Justice Department opposed racial hiquotas and pushed
to overturn a number of affirmative action programs.
   On e issue of federal set-asides, tgan administration was split
between those who favored continuing affirmative action on
government-financed projects and those who wanted to end such
program notably Reynolds and his boss, Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   ``They opposed them and did everything te them,'' said Barry
Goldstein, a private civil rights lawyer in Oakland, Calif., who
worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Etion Fund Inc.
   Former Labor Secretary Bill Brock and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who pushed set-asides when he was labor secretary in the
Nixon administration, sup the programs, Goldstein said.
   Shortly before the 1984 election, Reagan supported federal
set-aside prograt ``Brad Reynolds never gave up,ldstein said,
noting that the Justice Department joined the challenge to a
muniside law in Richmond, Va.
   The Supreme Court overturned the Richmond law, which required 30
percent participation on city public-works contracts by companies
that were haowned by minorities. The court ruled that the law was
unconstitutional and that there was no evidence of past
discrimination to justify the set-aside requirement.
   But the high court pointed out that Congress was empowered by
the 14tndment to ``identify and redress the effects of ide
discrimination'' with federal set-asides.
   ss determined there was a nationwide problem of ation, no
further finding of a local condition was needed to juderal
set-aside requirement in a particular loc The Justice Department
noted that distinctioniled in the North Carolina case with the 4th
U.Sppeal.
   ``Justice (Sandra Day) O'Connor's opcase) made clear numerous
times that it was addressing a program established by a state or
local government, and not by Congress,'' the department said,
defending the set-asde program for socially and economically
disadvantaged businesses required by the 1982 Surface
Transportation Assistance Act of 1982.

   This week's flare-up of Western wildfires can't hold a candle to
the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but
officials say a dry August could change everything.
   Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range
land since January in the contiguous United States, compared to 2.1
million acres by this time last year, fire officials said Monday.
   ``Right now, the fire season is just starting to gear up,'' said
Sandi Sacher, spokeswoman at the federal government's wildfire
command post in Boise, Idaho. Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five
Western states are battling hundreds of blazes, most of them
sparked last week by lightning.
   Fire is a natural part of Western forest and range land. But
some years are worse than others. Last year's combination of heat
and drought across a wide swath of the West produced a hellish
summer of smoke and flame.
   One of the hardest-hit areas was Yellowstone National Park,
where fire blackened about 1 million acres, nearly half the park's
territory.
   By year's end, 6 million acres had burned in the West and
Alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years, and, in
terms of firefighting resources committed, the most expensive in
U.S. history, Sacher said.
   The widespread drought of 1988 has been replaced by spotty rain
and local areas of dry weather, Sacher said. Fire danger is high
this week in parts of Oregon, Nevada and Idaho, the National
Weather Service said Monday.
   Forecasters just now are trying to get a handle on what kind of
weaer August will bring, Sacher said.
   ``It's arly to speculate,'' she said. ``Last year therein at
all. This year, it seems to be fluctuating. You'll get a dry
period, then a front will come through and it will rain.
   ``They're keeping a very close eye on the weatt, dry weather
with lightning strikes, that could be serious.''

<HEAD>Effort to Override FSX Veto Becoming `Turf Battle': Byrd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are waging what appears to be a
futile effort to override President Bush's veto of legislation
putting conditions on joint production with Japan of the FSX jet
fighter.
   Bush vetoed the advanced fighter Monday, declaring that its
binding terms would ``tie my hands in the exercise of my
constitutional responsibilities.''
   The $6 billion FSX agreement, negotiated by the administration
earlier this year, calls for development by General Dynamics and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of an advanced version of the F-16
fighter, intended to be deployed by Japan in the late 1990s.
   Opponents denounced the deal as a giveaway of critical U.S.
defense technology and predicted it would result in the eventual
loss of thousands of jobs in the U.S. aerospace industry.
   A House measure to restrict the agreement was passed in early
June on a 262-155 vote, far less than the two-thirds margin of 290
needed to override a veto in the 435-member chamber.
   An identical Senate resolution was adopted 72-27.
   Bush said the legislation would inject the General Accounting
Office, a legislative agency, into the administration of the FSX
program ``in a highly intrusive manner,'' trammeling the
constitutional powers of the president.
   ``I'm sorry this whole matter is being vetoed as a result of a
turf battle,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Noting that Bush's ``most violent'' objections stem from fears
of congressional infringement into his authority to negotiate with
foreign powers, Byrd said the bill doesn't infringe on the
president's constitutional prerogatives.
   The Constitution, Byrd said, gives Congress the right to
regulate foreign commerce. The courts have held that power includes
the ability to ban or regulate specified foreign commerce, he said.
   ``This legislation actually strengthens the president's position
for future negotiations with the Japanese,'' Byrd said. ``Yet the
president has, ironically, chosen to veto essentially our support
and reinforcement of his own policy on this issue.''
   The legislation bars the transfer of certain engine technologies
to Japan and prohibits the sale or transfer of the FSX to third
nations.

<TEXT>
   Gene Fodor's violin was a magic key, opening the
way to a tour when he was 12, a debut with the Denver Symphony when
he was 16, and top prize in the Tchaikovsky competition when he was
24.
   But last weekend, at 39, Fodor found his violin _ ``an
instrument,'' he once said, ``that is truly one of the most noble
ever devised'' _ couldn't get him out of jail.
   A judge on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard refused
to accept Fodor's offer of his 300-year-old violin to guarantee
bail following his arrest on drug and burglary charges. Instead,
bail was set at $50,000 cash.
   He was released on his own recognizance Monday.
   The musician, whose clean-cut good looks and love of the
outdoors helped make him a star 15 years ago, was arrested Thursday
after hotel maids found him in a room that was supposed to be
empty. Police said they found 20 grams of cocaine, heroin, a
hypodermic needle and a dagger in Fodor's possession.
   For Fodor, who burst on the scene as a horse-riding violin
prodigy, equally handy with the reins and the violin bow, the
arrest was another setback in a career that never quite lived up to
its promise.
   In 1974, when Fodor shared a silver medal with two Soviets at
the Tchaikovsky violin competition in Moscow, the rewards came
swiftly _ an invitation to perform at the White House, the key to
New York City, concert offers and television appearances.
   Here, finally, was a classical musician who seemed unbowed by
hours of practice and the stress of competition, a personable young
man who had grown up on a ranch in Turkey Creek, Colo., and still
loved to jog, ride and swim.
   Once, when asked to describe a premier violinist, Fodor replied
that he is healthy: ``I think running and swimming are the best
exercises for anyone. And racquetball, I play racquetball. And
scuba diving, though actually skin diving is better exercise.''
   And he could play. Audiences are supposed to hold their applause
for the end of a composition, but they often interrupted Fodor's
performances of Paganini's First Concerto with standing ovations
after the first movement.
   Within a year, however, ``Mr. Fodor's luck began running out,''
critic Allan Kozinn has written, ``and his career became a classic
example of unfulfilled promise.''
   New York Times critic Harold Schonberg, reviewing a performance
by Fodor the same year he won the Tchaikovsky, faulted the
violinist for selecting ``fluffy, showy salon pieces that are
usually played as encores.''
   ``If he is to specialize in this music,'' the critic added, ``he
will remain an entertainer and nothing more.''
   Fodor was only doing that which he did best and which drew the
greatest ovations: pieces written by other great violin virtuosos
to display their own technique. In as many as 100 concerts a year,
Fodor breezed through left-hand pizzicatos, trills and double
stops, and basked in the applause.
   ``Their interest was very flattering,'' he later said of his
audiences. ``And ... I like to please people.''
   He was not pleasing the critics, who wanted him to demonstrate a
more sophisticated musical sensibility. They also seemed put off by
the publicist's image of the violin-playing cowboy, and most wrote
him off as another prodigy who had failed to develop into a mature
artist.
   By 1984, even Fodor was dissatisfied with his career and his
image. He tried to play less Paganini and Tchaikovsky and more
Beethoven and Brahms, and he cut his schedule in half.
   ``I needed to think about what I am, what I do best, and which
areas I need to work the hardest in,'' he said at the time. ``I
needed more time to learn new music.''
   Harold Wippler, a former member of the Denver Symphony Orchestra
who taught Fodor for more than 10 years, said this week that early
publicity that made Fodor a sort of pop star may have backfired.
But he said Fodor ``was very up when I talked to him about two
months ago. He sounded very up.''
   Drugs seemed an unlikely problem for Fodor, and a family member
in New York who spoke on condition of anonymity said Fodor had
become involved in drugs relatively recently.
   ``The only explanation I can think of is that he does everything
in a thorough way,'' she said. ``He's a genius in his work and he
devotes all his energy to his work. He's very intense in whatever
he does.''

<HEAD>Ruling Says North Not Eligible for Pension</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Comptroller says former Marine
officer Oliver North isn't eligible for his $23,000 a year pension.
   ``There is serious doubt that a retired regular officer
convicted'' of destroying government documents ``continues to be
entitled to retired pay,'' lawyers in the General Accounting
Office, headed by Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, said Monday.
   ``It has long been the government's practice'' not to provide
retirement pay to someone convicted of destroying government
documents, GAO general counsel James Hinchman said in a letter.
   ``The denial of payment gives Col. North the right to sue for
it,'' Hinchman noted.
   North's lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, had no immediate comment on
the ruling, a secretary said late Monday afternoon.
   North was sentenced July 5 to 1,200 hours of community service
and fined $150,000 for his conviction on charges of aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress, accepting an illegal gratuity
and altering or destroying classified documents.
   The Navy said then that it was suspending the pension North
earned during 20 years in the Marine Corps, but that it would
recommend the pension be reinstated.
   ``We're aware of the (GAO) opinion,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Craig
Quigley. ``We keep going back to our Navy Department recommendation
that it should be continued.''
   Federal law says a custodian who destroys government documents
forfeits his public office.
   The Navy's judge advocate general, Everette Stumbaugh, concluded
that North, as a retiree, doesn't hold office and that North's
pension should be continued.
   However, Navy general counsel Lawrence Lamade said that North,
as a retired Marine Corps officer, holds a U.S. office, at least
for some purposes.
   Quigley said the comptroller general's decision doesn't affect
other benefits that come with North's position, such as commissary
and exchange privileges, medical benefits and the right to carry a
card identifying himself as a retired military officer.

   The dollar recovered slightly after opening sharply
lower against the Japanese yen in Tokyo Tuesday, while stock prices
dipped.
   The U.S. currency began the day at 135.95 yen, its lowest
opening level since the 135.40 yen registered on May 12, and 2.45
yen below its closing figure Monday. It then edged up in quiet
trading, ending the day at 136.65 yen for a loss of 1.75 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 34,898.46, down 55.41 points from its record-high closing
on Monday.
   Traders said the dollar's plunge followed its similar downward
direction in overseas markets because of a drop in U.S. interest
rates.
   ``The major contributing factor to the dollar's sharp decline is
lowering U.S. interest rates,'' said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   He said activity was light in the Tokyo market as some companies
began their summer vacations this week.
   Several major U.S. banks, including Chemical Bank and
Continental Bank, lowered their prime rate to 10.5 percent from
11.0 percent Monday.
   The prime rate is watched closely as bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans.

<HEAD>Chinatown `Goddess of Democracy' Statue Destroyed During Night</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 1,500-pound copy of the Goddess of
Democracy was toppled from its Chinatown perch, but an artist said
the statue erected to protest the bloody Beijing crackdown will be
quickly rebuilt.
   ``That original one was knocked down for a reason by the tanks,
and I presume this one was knocked down for the same reason,''
Santa Monica artist Tom Van Sant said Monday after the 23-foot-tall
statue was found crushed and broken in pieces.
   ``I believe art is very powerful, and I'm glad to see that these
people apparently think, so too, or they wouldn't have risked
committing a crime,'' he said.
   Van Sant said the statue may be rebuilt in two or three weeks.
   ``We'll build it stronger this time; we'll fix 'em. We can
create as fast as they can destroy,'' he said.
   Someone cut ropes holding up the plastic foam, wood and plaster
figure Sunday night and it crashed to the ground at the entrance of
the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, said President
Stephen K. Yee.
   ``I think that somebody against liberty, against freedom''
destroyed the figure, Yee said. ``That statue is destroyed ... but
they cannot destroy the spirit in the heart of the people.''
   Police officers began an investigation.
   Yee said a witness heard a noise between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. and
first thought there had been a car crash.
   Joe Cortez, a parking attendant at nearby Little Joe's
Restaurant, said he ``saw a couple of Oriental guys in their teens
running away.''
   The 23-foot-tall statue was modeled after the 30-foot-tall
Goddess of Democracy raised by Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on May 30.

   An African elephant that was being treated for
eating too much dirt lost her patience and kicked a zookeeper,
breaking his right leg.
   But Henry Kacprzyk was philosophical about his injury.
   ``What really happened (is) she got fed up with the treatments.
She's smart,'' said Kacprzyk, 35.
   Pittsburgh Zoo officials said the 4,100 pound elephant Tribby
was suffering from ``sand impaction,'' which causes diarrhea.
   Kacprzyk and another zookeeper, Diane Hagey, were trying to
chain two of the elephant's legs Friday before giving her extra
water, oral medicine and a high-fiber diet when she used a hind leg
to kick Kacprzyk several times.
   ``Elephants are very powerful animals, very intelligent
animals,'' said zoo Director Charles Wikenhauser. ``This was a
reaction.''
   He said the elephant was feeling better this week.
   Kacprzyk was hospitalized and also suffered cuts and bruises.

   A former top housing official apparently lied
in telling Congress two years ago that she deferred all funding
decisions to her boss, former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, say
congressional investigators.
   ``Well, somebody's not telling the truth,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., who brought up testimony given in 1987 by Deborah
Gore Dean, former executive assistant to Pierce at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   Schumer suggested Monday that Ms. Dean, who is refusing to
testify in Congress' investigation of the HUD scandal, lied under
oath in 1987.
   Ms. Dean's lawyer, Joseph diGenova, issued a statement saying,
``Any suggestion that Miss Dean committed perjury is legally and
factually wrong.''
   Pierce has told a House subcommittee investigating allegations
of corruption and influence-peddling at HUD that he took no part in
funding decisions at the agency. He headed HUD during the eight
years of the Reagan administration.
   ``I did not have hands-on,'' Pierce testified in May before the
House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment.
He said the decisions were made by subordinates and he would
rubber-stamp them.
   But Ms. Dean said Pierce was calling the shots, in testimony
under oath two years ago at a Senate hearing considering her
nomination to be an assistant housing secretary.
   ``All funding decisions are made by the secretary,'' she
testified. ``We do recommend to him areas of concern. Many times we
are overruled.'' Ms. Dean did not win Senate confirmation.
   Schumer said the testimony of Ms. Dean and Pierce represented a
``direct, and I would say immutable, contradiction.''
   Schumer and Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House
panel, referred to Ms. Dean's 1987 testimony in which she also said
she had ``never given or approved or pushed or coerced anyone to
help any developer.''
   ``I'm no expert in perjury, but this seems to be a
black-and-white case,'' Schumer said.
   Ms. Dean, in her appearance before the House panel two months
ago, declined to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   In August 1987, Ms. Dean told a Senate panel that she did not
approve projects on her own.
   ``Have you ever approved a grant in the secretary's name, using
his autopen, or whatever, without formally seeking his approval?''
then-Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., had asked Ms. Dean.
   ``No, sir,'' she replied.
   But the House panel has heard from witnesses and reviewed
documents that say otherwise.
   Documents indicate that numerous letters approving funding for
projects had Pierce's signature, applied by a signature machine at
Ms. Dean's direction. On routing slips, she would sometimes
indicate whether the machine should sign his full name, or just
``Sam.''
   Schumer also brought out a 1986 report by the Office of
Government Ethics that condemned the way federal ethics laws were
enforced at HUD.
   ``HUD's ethics program is one of the most ill-managed this team
has ever seen in a major department,'' the report said.
   Schumer introduced the report as John Knapp, former HUD general
counsel who oversaw the ethics program, testified a second time
before the subcommittee.
   Knapp returned to explain why he now denies giving a legal
opinion that he earlier testified that he gave while at HUD. That
verbal opinion on the applicability of a federal law has been cited
by HUD officials as the legal basis that permitted some funding
decisions.
   Even after hearing him for a second time, members of the panel
were still puzzled. ``How did your never-given oral legal opinion
gain such wide currency at HUD?'' Lantos asked.
   Also testifying Monday before the panel was Maurice Barksdale, a
former HUD assistant secretary for housing.
   Barksdale told the subcommittee that beginning a year after he
left HUD, he worked as a consultant on as many as nine projects
over a three-year period. He estimated he was paid a total of
$300,000.
   By comparison, former Interior Secretary James Watt was paid
more than that for his work as a consultant on just one HUD project.

   Susan Ford Vance, daughter of former President
Ford, apparently doesn't believe in long engagements.
   She became engaged last month to Tulsa, Okla., lawyer Vaden
Bales and planned to wed before the end of the year. But the couple
tied the knot July 25 while vacationing in Duck, N.C., The
Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   ``We decided there was no point in waiting,'' she said.
   Susan Ford married Chuck Vance, a former Secret Service agent
who was assigned to protect her father after he left the White
House, in 1979. The couple, who have two daughters, were divorced
in December.
   The only relatives attending last week's ceremony were the
bride's two daughters and two of Bales' three sons.
   The couple will live in Tulsa.

   President Bush's quick trip to the governors
conference brought a reunion for the governors with their former
chairman, John Sununu.
   The former governor of New Hampshire, who a year ago was
presiding over the National Governors' Association, successfully
guided Bush's candidacy through the minefields of the New Hampshire
primary last year and after the election became White House chief
of staff.
   He took a seat at the governors' table next to Bush on Monday _
and came in for some pointed ribbing from his former colleagues.
   ``He is the same easy-going, soft-spoken, self-effacing man we
knew as governor of New Hampshire,'' said Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, a Democrat. He he drew laughter from governors of both
parties, many of whose recollections of Sununu were more of a
prickly and short-tempered leader.
   Sununu merely grinned and raised his arms in a shrug.

   Bush, who acknowledged that Sununu was ``not quiet and
retiring'' also had words for Virginia's Baliles, who was stepping
down after a year as chairman of the association.
   ``I studied Latin for four years,'' Bush said. ``Soon you will
be chairman emeritus. `E' in Latin means out; `meritus,' damn well
deserves to be.''
   Baliles will soon be a governor emeritus too. He leaves office
after the end of this year after a single four year term. He
mentioned several times during the governors' four-day conference
that it was Virginia's constitution, and not his choice, that ws
prompting his retirement.

   The president appeared a bit startled when he saw Ohio's
governor, Democrat Richard Celeste. And he wasn't the only one.
   Celeste returned from a fishing trip on Lake Erie three weeks
ago sporting a full salt-and-pepper beard.
   Calling on Celeste for a question after his speech, Bush said,
``I didn't recognize you.''
   Afterward, Bush walked around the row of tables arranged in a
square where the governors sat and shook hands with each. He
stopped briefly at Celeste and remarked again.
   ``He said, `I don't care what anyone else says, I like it,'''
Celeste reported.
   The Ohio Democrat, who under state law can not seek a third term
next year, said he intends to keep the beard for a while.

   Walking around the assembled governors, Bush also came face to

   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who is leaving office after two

praise by his colleagues during the conference. Kean, a moderate
Republican, was praised no less by Democrats than Republicans.
   But New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who enthusiastically joined in
the chorus, interrupted his own praise for Kean to add a bit of
explanation.
   ``It probably is a little easier to talk kindly about
Republicans when they're on their way out,'' Cuomo said.

   Pro-Iranian extremists said they would
follow the purported hanging of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins with
the ``execution'' today of another U.S. hostage unless Israel frees
a Shiite Moslem cleric it abducted.
   The new threat, made after kidnappers released a videotape they
claimed showed Higgins dangling from a gallows on Monday, said
Joseph James Cicippio would be killed if the Moslem cleric was not
freed by 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT).
   But Israel refused to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, saying it
would swap him and other Shiite Moslem prisoners for three Israeli
soldiers and other foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   An Israeli army spokesman said Monday that Obeid had confessed
to directing the Feb. 17, 1988, kidnapping of Higgins.
   The cleric is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
organization believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers
holding Higgins and the 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon.
Eight of the 16 are Americans.
   Higgins' reported hanging was clouded by doubt because of
previous reports he may have been killed months ago. Nevertheless,
the claim and the grisly videotape that accompanied it met with
revulsion worldwide.
   President Bush, who in response cut short a two-day Western trip
and met with top advisers in Washington, condemned the reported
killing of the U.S. Marine and called on ``all parties'' holding
hostages in the Middle East to release them.
   In a statement Monday night, he said he wanted to go beyond
comments he made after Israel seized Obeid on Friday in a raid into
south Lebanon, when he said kidnappings were harmful to the Middle
East peace process.
   He said he was issuing an ``urgent call to all, all parties who
hold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as a
humanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in
that region.''
   Higgins' pro-Iranian captors, who call themselves the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, claimed they hanged him
because Israel refused to release Obeid.
   The group released a 30-second videotape of poor quality showing
a man hanging from a gallows. There was no indication when it was
made and no body was reported found.
   Rope bound the bare feet and hands of the man purported to be
Higgins, who commanded a group of U.N. truce observers in south
Lebanon when he was seized.
   The group claiming to hold Cicippio, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, issued its threat to kill him in a note, handwritten
in Arabic and delivered to the newspaper An-Nahar with a photograph
of Cicippio smiling and waring a brown-and-pink wool sweater over a
blue pullover.
   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller at the
American University of Beirut when he was kidnapped on the campus
on Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``The organization announces its quick resolve to execute the
death sentence against the American-Israeli spy Joseph Cicippio if
the struggling sheik is not released by 6 p.m. Tuesday,'' the
statement said. ``Then the deadline will be set for the execution,
which will be broadcast on all screens in the world.''
   Revolutionary Justice did not mention Edward Austin Tracy, 58,
of Burlington, Vt., another American hostage it claims to hold.
Tracy disappeared in October 1986.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
Oppressed on Earth telephoned The Associated Press and said the
group would kill a British hostage, Anglican Church envoy Terry
Waite, at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) today unless Obeid was released.
   It could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the
organization, which had not made previous calls to the AP office in
Cyprus.
   Today, another anonymous caller claiming to speak for Oppressed
on Earth said in a call to a Beirut radio station that Waite would
be killed by midnight unless Israel frees Obeid.
   There was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat,
made to the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation.
   Lebanese police said they could not confirm the claimed Higgins
killing.
   A typewritten statement in Arabic said Higgins, 44, was hanged
at 3 p.m. It and the tape were delivered to a Western news agency
in Beirut an hour later.
   A Lebanese police spokesman said: ``It seems highly unlikely
that the captors were able to hang the man, take the film and
distribute it inside an hour.''
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Obeid had confessed personal
involvementin ``planning and guiding and aiding'' the abduction of
Higgins and had revealed the names of his captors.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, deputy foreign minister, said Israel would
not release Obeid despite threats of more killings. ``They must
understand that we will not give in to the dictates of their
blackmail,'' he declared.
   After Higgins' death claim was made, Senate Republican leader
Bob Dole of Kansas criticized the abduction of Obeid: ``Perhaps a
little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis one of these
days would be refreshing.''
   White House officials avoided direct criticism of Israel, but
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is fair to say that
many people do share the senator's concerns.'' He would not
elaborate.
   State Department officials, speaking privately, said they found
reports that the man in the videotape was Higgins to be credible,
but could not say whether it was made Monday or earlier.
   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before the
reported hanging that the threat to Higgins ``has nothing to do
with us,'' but added that Israe should be pressed to release Obeid.
   ``We condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat,'' he said.
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attached
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was
abducted. Previous statements from his captors claimed he used the
U.N. post as a cover for spying on Moslem guerrillas.
   In a statement on Dec. 12, 1988, they said Higgins had been
sentenced to death after making ``full confessions about his
espionage activities.''
   Sources in the U.N. force have said they believe Higgins was
dead when that statement was issued. They said they had information
he died of maltreatment after an escape attempt.
   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the release
of foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel to
negotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,
though no group has claimed responsibility.
   American Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Australia Reports Second Live-Donor Liver Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese woman donated part of her
liver to her dying son in what doctors today said was only the
world's second such live-donor operation.
   ``It's unquestionably a medical breakthrough because no previous
liver donor has been alive in Australia,'' said Princess Alexandra
Hospital spokesman Chris Davidson.
   The woman, Atsuko Tsuruyama, 29, had part of her liver removed
and transplanted to her 17-month-old son, Iichirou, who had been
given only months to live after being born without bile ducts.
   ``The significant thing is that the mother is a live donor and
alive after the operation,'' said Davidson. ``Kidney transplants
are fairly routine these days, but a person only has one liver.''
   Doctors originally said the procedure, carried out on Friday,
was the first of its kind in the world. But Davidson said word
reached the hospital early today that a hospital in Brazil
performed an similar operation last week.
   He had no further information on the hospital involved but said
doctors in Brazil used the same technique that was developed by
Princess Alexandra surgeons.
   Live-donor liver transplants were made possible by recent
breakthroughs in which physicians have been able to split livers,
the body's only regenerative organ.
   Mrs. Tsuruyama was recovering today and reported ``progressing
well'' after being released from intensive care. Her son also was
reported progressing well in intensive care and was expected to be
remain on the critical list for another 10 days, Davidson said.
   He said the next few days were crucial to Iichirou's survival
because this was when rejection of the organ or infection was most
likely to occur.
   Mrs. Tsuruyama is from Yatsushiro in Kumamoto Prefecture in
southern Japan.
   ``I still have some abdominal pain, but am able to mobilize and
am feeling better as the days go on,'' she told a news conference
today. ``When the possibility was first given to me the only thing
I could think of was the chance to help my child. The doctors told
me that this surgery was very difficult and I was very worried
before the operation.''
   The head of Queensland Liver Transplant Service, Dr. Russell
Strong, said one of the difficulties faced by the team of surgeons
that carried out the operation was dividing the liver without
harming the donor.
   Without the transplant, Iichirou's chances for survival were
nil, Strong said.
   One reason the Tsuruyama family was chosen was that time had
been running out for the boy and his chances of obtaining a
suitable donor liver in time were limited, as Australian nationals
had priority on the transplant program.
   In a statement issued at the conference, Strong, said: ``Despite
the advances we have made in cutting down adult livers for use in
children, there is still a major shortfall in the demand for livers
for children.''
   Davison said the family had been in Australia waiting for the
operation since January and that the procedure cost them $82,500,
which they raised in Japan from donations.

<HEAD>Thousands Jam Museum to View Uprising Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people jammed into a military museum
today to view a new exhibit devoted to the pro-democracy uprising,
while citizens generally ignored celebrating the anniversary of the
army.
   Nearly 6,000 people visited the Military Museum of the Chinese
People's Revolution in just three hours, compared with 3,000 to
4,000 visitors on an average day, museum employees said.
   Crowds gathered four or five deep in front of the displays of
the seven-week student movement, pointing at black-and-white photos
of marches that drew up to 1 million people.
   ``Look, that's Chai Ling,'' one young man said to a girl as he
pointed to a photo of one of the student leaders.
   The pro-democracy movement was crushed June 3-4 by the army,
which killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in clearing central
Beijing of protesters. The government has since portrayed the army
as having heroically ended an uprising organized by thugs.
   Those who managed to get close to the museum exhibits bent over
glass cases, carefully reading the petitions, handbills and posters
calling for greater freedoms.
   The exhibit, which occupies one wing of the museum's second
floor, included loudspeakers, a printing press, a computer, several
portable phones and weapons that allegedly were confiscated from
the students.
   It also showed rows of battered army helmets, mangled rifles
with broken butts and blood-soaked army uniforms.
   More than half of the exhibit was devoted to displays showing
the bravery and the patience of the army and the leadership of the
party since the crackdown. But few people lingered long in front of
those displays.
   The museum was one of the few places where crowds gathered on
Army Day, which marks the Aug. 1, 1927 founding of what later
became the People's Liberation Army.
   It has never been considered one of China's major holidays. But
this year, the hype was building for weeks as the government tried
to shore up the army's image and prestige in the wake of the
crackdown.
   The media has given prominent play to leaders' exhortations that
Army Day be especially festive this year, but in the streets of the
capital today there was little outward celebration.
   City officials had suggested that central Tiananmen Square would
be filled with soldiers taking part in grand Army Day celebrations,
but there was little activity in vast plaza that was the focus of
the pro-democracy protests.
   Several hundred soldiers attended an early morning awards
ceremony, but the event was brief and lackluster.
   Soldiers stood facing a single red banner as a tape-recording of
the national anthem played. A leader gave a speech as bicyclists
hurried past the square to work. Twenty minutes later, the square
was empty again.
   The biggest celebration of Army Day was in the nation's
newspapers, almost all of which carried front-page editorials
praising the army's patriotism and its heroic exploits in history
and during the recent turmoil, which the government calls a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
   ``Officers and soldiers have stood up to all tests and used
their blood and lives to protect ... the party ... and the people's
power and safety,'' said a People's Daily editorial.
   The People's Daily and other newspapers stressed the need for
good relations between the army and the masses.
   ``The recent counter-revolutionary rebellion taught us that .. .
the army cannot be separated from the people ... that only with the
support of the people can the army surmount obstacles and complete
its mission,'' the People's Daily said.

   The Soviet Union today denounced the reported
hanging of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in Lebanon as ``inhuman'',
but also faulted Israel for kidnapping Shiite Moslem cleric Sheikh
Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev read out a brief
statement at a hastily called news briefing saying, ``We resolutely
denounce this inhuman action.''
   A pro-Iranian group, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth,
said it hanged the U.S. Marine on Monday because Israel refused to
release Obeid, who was abducted from his south Lebanon home on
Friday.
   ``The fact that the aggravation of the situation in Lebanon,
caused specifically by the abduction of Shiite leader Sheikh Obeid
by Israeli commandos, has led to an escalation of acts of violence
and terror and evokes profound concern,'' the statement said.
   ``The Soviet Union regards such actions as a gross violation of
human rights and dangerous for the whole international
atmosphere,'' it said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, currently in Tehran
on an official visit, will take up the matter of Higgins' reported
death with Iranian officials, Perfiliev said, without elaboration.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today
on predictions of lower U.S. interest rates, traders said, while
prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined moderately.
   The U.S. currency opened at 135.95 yen, 2.45 yen below its close
of 138.40 yen on Monday. It was the dollar's lowest opening since
May 12, when it started trading at 135.40 yen. It closed at 136.65
yen after ranging between 135.80 and 136.96 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 2.80 yen in two days.
   ``Many participants began the day selling the dollar because of
the impact from overseas markets, where it also was sold
overnight,'' said Nobuhiko Hibara of the Bank of Tokyo. ``But then
the dollar began edging up, and the general trend of the rest of
the day was recovery.''
   Traders said the dollar's losses were linked to reports of
falling interest rates in the United States, while its rebound was
due in part to profit-taking.
   ``The major contributing factor to the dollar's sharp decline
was lowering U.S. interest rates,'' said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said activity was light on the Tokyo market as some companies
began their summer vacations this week.
   Traders said the dollar appeared to have weathered an attempt to
test its lower limits, but many said they expect another attempt
this week.
   ``Whether or not there is another attempt at the low end is very
important to the trend from now on,'' said Michiko Kawai, chief
corporate trader at Security Pacific National Bank in Tokyo.
   ``There was a good chance that if the dollar had gone below
135.80 yen, we would have gone on down to 135 yen, but it didn't
work that way, at least on the first try,'' said another dealer,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference
Tuesday that the dollar's recent decline accurately reflected the
``economic fundamentals'' between the United States and Japan, and
said the fall ``isn't too fast.''
   Murayama also attributed the dollar's decline in part to the
outlook for lower U.S. interest rates.
   On Monday, several major U.S. banks, including Chemical Bank and
Continental Bank, lowered their prime rates to 10.5 percent from
11.0 percent. The prime rate, the interest rate that banks charge
their best customers, has a wide effect on other interest rates.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said political uncertainty
resulting from the governing Liberal Democratic Party's struggle to
find a successor for resigning Prime Minister Sousuke Uno
contributed to a decline.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 34,898.46, down
55.41 points, or 0.16 percent, from its finish Monday, when it
climbed 248.24 points to a record high.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 700
million shares, up from 500 million shares on Monday.

   Ranchers are set to cash in on what one official
called a ``modern day cattle drive'': the resumption of beef sales
to Europe following settlement of a dispute over hormones in
American cows.
   The first shipment of domestic and hormone-free beef to Europe
since a January embargo halted all U.S. beef exports to the
continent was to have left a Houston port today on its way to
England had Hurricane Chantal not intervened.
   ``From the onset, we at the Texas Department of Agriculture felt
that more was at stake than steak, and a whole lot more was at
stake than growth hormones,'' said Texas Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower at a news conference Monday. ``This shipment is
pretty much the test case.''
   In May, the Bush administration and the 12-nation European
Community reached an interim agreement that allowed resumption of
sales of about 15 percent of the $100 million in U.S. beef exports
to Europe. However, a dispute over the other 85 percent remains to
be resolved.
   European countries said the import ban of hormone-treated beef
was made due to health concerns over the growth stimulant.
   American officials have maintained that the ban represented an
illegal trade barrier masquerading as a health measure. In
retaliation, the United States slapped tariffs on European goods
valued at about $100 million.
   Under the agreement, U.S. beef producers may export beef not
treated with growth hormones to Europe.
   The refrigerated container of 40,000 pounds of Texas
hormone-free beef was boarded onto the Nedlloyd Hudson Monday.
   Hightower said the shipment could signal an economic boon for
beef producers.
   ``This is the start of a modern day cattle drive that can put
millions of extra dollars into the pockets of enterprising Texas
ranchers, feedlot operators and meet packers,'' Hightower said.
   The shipment of beef, worth about $100,000, was processed by Cox
Packing Co. in Devine, near San Antonio, and being sent to TSW
Meats Ltd. of Liverpool. The company has an option with Cox Packing
to make an additional purchase of hormone-free beef valued at about
$1.5 million.
   Hightower said Texas ranchers normally don't give hormones to
their cattle. Feedlot operators, however, give the hormones to
increase the weight of the livestock, he said.

<HEAD>Indians, State Reach Tentative Accord To Ease Reservation Tension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An agreement to remove state police
roadblocks at the St. Regis Indian Reservation should help ease
tensions in a 10-day-old standoff there, Mohawk leaders and state
officials said.
   Five Mohawk leaders met in Albany Monday with state police,
members of Gov. Mario Cuomo's staff and a representative of the
federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to help resolve tensions on the
reservation along the St. Lawrence River in northern New York.
   More than 200 state troopers have been manning roadblocks to
keep outsiders out of the reservation's casinos, which police and
FBi agents raided July 20.
   ``We will be scaling down the checkpoints and allowing the
motoring public onto the reservation,'' said state trooper Richard
Garcia. ``We're hopeful this will ease the tension.''
   ``We have reached a tentative agreement which assures everyone's
safety,'' said Mohawk Chief Harold Tarbell. ``It was an effort to
reduce the tensions on the reservation.''
   State police were to erect informational barricades for an
indefinite time, Garcia said. Troopers at those barricades will
explain the situation on the reservation to motorists, giving them
the option to enter the Indian land or turn back, he said.
   The casinos will remain closed, Tarbell said. Mohawk leaders
have scheduled a vote for mid-August on whether reservation
residents want to legalize gambling.
   The gambling issue has divided the Mohawk community. The raid
prompted protests by the reservation's warrior faction, which
claims police have no jurisdiction on Mohawk land.
   About a dozen people were injured last week when a group of
Mohawks tried to prevent state police from arresting warrior leader
Art Montour on a federal charge of obstructing justice.
   Montour was accused of using a gun to keep police from searching
a casino during the raid.
   In Syracuse, U.S. Magistrate Gustave DiBianco on Monday set bail
for Montour at $50,000. Montour was released after posting $5,000.
He was to appear again in court Aug. 16.

<HEAD>Lawyer Sentenced to Death For Killing Elderly People in Will Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer was sentenced to death today for
masterminding the murders of eight elderly people as part of a
sophisticated scheme to forge their wills and acquire their wealth.
   Christos Papadopoulos, who called his white-collar crime ring
``Murder Inc.'' and whose mother-in-law was among its victims,
laughed when his sentence was announced. He had been convicted of
murder on Monday.
   Despite the decision, Papadopoulos is not likely to be executed.
Greece is a member of the European Economic Community and the trade
group prohibits capital punishment.
   Although the death sentence remains on the books, it has in
practice been abolished and condemned prisoners remain in jail for
life. The last execution took place in 1972.
   Twenty other gang members were sentenced today by a three-member
judicial panel and a four-member jury. Gang member Nikos Peppas was
sentenced to life imprisonment and 19 others were given prison
terms ranging from two to 10 years. All were convicted.
   Authorities say Murder Inc.'s members included notary publics,
lawyers, a doctor and a police officer.
   Among the victims, all elderly, were a shipowner, a blind
lottery ticket salesman and Papadopoulos' mother-in-law.
   Authorities said that between 1979 and 1986, the gang members
forged wills worth at least $18.7 million.
   The 55-day trial began on May 17 with scores of witnesses
testifying how the gang won the confidence of lonely old people
before killing them.
   In several instances, the victims were forced to sign blank
pieces of paper before being suffocated or bludgeoned to death.
   In his closing argument Monday, Prosecutor Vassilis Markis
described Papadopoulos as ``a very clever individual, with great
capabilities. If his intelligence and his organizational skills had
been directed elsewhere things would have been very different.''
   Papadopoulos, testifying during the trial, cast himself as a
latter-day Robin Hood.
   ``I wanted to hand out social justice,'' Papadopoulos said,
claiming that he took from the rich and gave to the poor.
   `If there were 100 Murder Inc.'s the (social) situation today
would be very different,'' he said.
   When asked by the court to elaborate on his role in the murders,
Papadopoulos replied: ``Let's not go into that.''
   The wills drawn up by the gang aroused no suspicion until the
1986 death of 84-year-old shipowner Haralambos Typaldos. Relatives
contested the will, which listed 135 beneficiaries, of whom only
nine were known to the family.

<TEXT>
   Eight performers who fled a Chinese opera
company may seek political asylum in the United States, and some in
the Chinese community predicted the episode would put a chill in
U.S.-Chinese cultural exchanges.
   The eight, including a Shanghai opera star, apparently were
weighing other options besides asylum. The Bush Administration has
offered one-year blanket visa extensions to all Chinese citizens
who were in the country on or before June 5.
   ``I think at this moment they fear making a wrong move _ whether
they should seek political asylum or use other reasons to remain
here,'' said Jeff Shia, president of the Kiangsu Chekiang
Association, a non-profit group that helps new Chinese immigrants
establish themselves in the city.
   The performers left the 28-member Shanghai Opera while the
company was in San Francisco en route to Shanghai last week after a
series of performances in the United States.
   Wang Shaohua, an official with China's consulate in San
Francisco, said those who fled ``were instigated by people with
motives to bring damage to China.''
   Immigration officials in San Francisco said they had not been
contacted by the performers and did not know whether the group
planned to defect.
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that it would be the
biggest single defection of Chinese citizens since the 1950s.
   The opera company performed at the Palace of Fine Arts, in San
Francisco, on June 30 and July 1-2, said Kevin O'Brien, a spokesman
for the theater.
   The company then went New York for four performances. After the
group returned to San Francisco last week, eight performers
disappeared over two days. The opera company flew back to Shanghai
without them Thursday.
   The first group of four disappeared last Tuesday during a
farewell party in Chinatown given by the Chinese community.
   They apparently said they were going shopping.
   ``Nobody suspected anything until midnight when the rest of the
group searched their rooms and found the suitcases were empty,''
said Shia, who was at the party and said he is friends with some of
the opera singers.
   Opera members called the Chinese consulate after discovering the
performers were missing, and were told to go to the consulate to
discuss the matter immediately, Shia said.
   Three of the four opera members who went to the consulate went
into hiding shortly thereafter and were joined by another member
later Wednesday morning, according to Shia.
   Included in the group who remained here was Hua Wen-Yi, a famous
opera singer in Shanghai, said Leonard Lee, editor of the Chinese
Times, a Chinese language daily newspaper in San Francisco.
   ``Everybody in Shanghai knows her,'' Lee said.
   Hua is called ``Little Mei Langfang,'' after a performer known
as the 20th century's top interpreter of female roles in Beijing
opera, Shia said.
   Two other singers in the group, Chen Tong-Shen and Zhan
Ping-Ping, also are well known, Lee said.
   Zhan is a famous television and film star as well as an opera
performer, Shia said.
   The others were identified as Qui Huan, Chen Chi-Ping, Ma
Xin-Bao, Peter Chong and Lou Sei-Long.
   Lee said the apparent defections could have a chilling effect on
Chinese cultural relations with the United States.
   ``Predictably, cultural exchanges will be down to the minimum,''
he said.
   The opera visit was sponsored by the Peace Travel Company.
Company officials had no comment.
   The tour by the opera company was arranged before the June 4
crackdown by the Chinese government on the pro-democracy movement
in Beijing.
   In June, two staff members of the Chinese consulate defected,
asking for ``adjustment of residency status'' rather than political
asylum. The outcome of their applications was not immediately known.

   American travelers are being warned about
visiting Kenya following the slaying last week of a Connecticut
woman ambushed during a wildlife tour.
   In a travel advisory issued Monday, the State Department said
there have been ``a few instances of attacks on tourists'' in
Kenya, particularly ``along the coast south of Mombasa and in
remote areas of the country, including some national parks. Most of
these attacks, some of which resulted in deaths of tourists, have
been attributed to heavily armed wildlife poachers.
   ``When visiting game parks, Americans are encouraged to travel
in groups with a guide from a reputable safari firm or a game
ranger,'' the advisory said.
   Marie Magdefrau Ferraro, 50, of Bethany, Conn., was shot to
death Thursday when two bandits armed with assault rifles emerged
from nearby bushes and began firing at a van carrying a Connecticut
Audubon Society wildlife tour group.

   Taiwan's chief government spokesman used the
opening of an information center to highlight differences between
his government and China's.
   With China's crackdown on the democracy movement, ``the truth is
finally coming out of the cruel nature of communism,'' said Shaw
Yu-ming, director-general of Government Information, at the opening
of Taiwan's new downtown Washington information center.
   In contrast, Nationalist China on Taiwan is experiencing ``a
political transformation reaching down to its grass roots,'' he
said.
   Shaw, on a U.S. speaking tour, said Taiwan has been moving
toward multiparty democracy since its lifting of martial law and
wants the rest of the world to know ``that we are ever more
concerned about the fate and destiny of people in the Chinese
mainland.''
   The Taiwan information center provides background and research

   ``Fire Company'' Toy Recalled

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``Fire Company'' toy is being recalled
because small parts could pose a choking hazard to children, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission says.
   ``Fire Company'' includes a small red plastic fire engine, red
hook and ladder truck, two plastic firemen and a plastic street
railroad sign mounted on a display card and sold for $1 to $2,
officials said Monday.
   About 24,000 of the toys were sold from September 1987 to
September 1988, the commission said. They were imported by Larami
Corp. of Philadelphia.
   The display card contains the name ``Fire Company'' on top and,
at the bottom, ``Larami. Item No. 1134-0.'' The toys are labeled
``Made in Hong Kong.''
   The wheels and other small parts could become detached from the
fire trucks and pose a choking hazard, said the safety commission.
   The agency said the toys should be returned to the retailer
where purchased for a refund.
   More information can be obtained from the safety commission at

   The Food and Drug Administration has been
asked by an advisory committee to reverse plans to allow
nonprescription sales of a cough-cold drug because of its possible
association with sudden infant death syndrome.
   The agency had planned to allow over-the-counter sales of the
drug, promethazine hydrochloride, in multi-ingredient cold products
for short-term use.
   But the FDA asked its Pulmonary Drugs Advisory Committee to
review the issue in light of a petition from the Public Citizen
Health Research Group and the University of Maryland Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome Institute.
   The groups said the drug, which has been sold in prescription
products since 1951, may contribute to some cases of the syndrome
known as SIDS. Though it is not recommended for use in young
children, doctors do prescribe it for them, for colic, the groups
said.
   The advisory committee voted 7-1 to recommend that the drug
remain a prescription ingredient, said Susan Cruzan, an FDA
spokeswoman.
   The drug is an active ingredient in products sold under the
trade name Phenergan, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia. Wyeth-Ayerst and other makers of prescription
products using the drug agreed to withhold nonprescription
marketing pending review by the advisory committee.

<HEAD>Cocaine Use Growing, Overall Drug Use Down, Survey Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine and crack addiction is growing in
America, but the number of casual drug users has been cut sharply,
a new drug abuse survey shows.
   The 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse released Monday
found a 37 percent drop from a 1985 survey in the number of people
who said they had used marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs in
the previous month.
   The survey also showed the number of people who said they had
used an illegal drug during the previous year fell by 25 percent
over the three years.
   ``We are making some real progress in this war,'' said William
Bennett, director of federal drug control policy. ``People who have
been saying all is lost, we can't win, let's legalize (drugs) have
never been more wrong.
   ``Drugs are cheap and they are available almost everywhere, yet
millions of Americans who once used them regularly appear now to
have given them up altogether. This is primarily a triumph of
changed attitudes,'' he said.
   However, the survey also found that the number of heavy cocaine
users, including those using the highly addictive form of the drug
known as crack, rose sharply between 1985 and 1988 _ by 33 percent
for those using it once a week or more and by 19 percent for daily
and almost-daily users.
   Though casual cocaine use dropped sharply overall _ by 50
percent for previous-month use _ the survey found that among blacks
and Hispanics the numbers did not change significantly.
   According to the survey, 72 million Americans _ 37 percent of
the population _ had tried at least one illicit drug in their
lifetimes.
   ``Illicit drug use by Americans remains much too high,'' said
Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services. But, he added, ``attitudes are changing.''
   Casual users are ``the ones who serve as a base for cocaine and
crack addicts,'' he said. ``So if we can reduce the number of
casual users, in time we will also influence the number of
addicts.''
   Sullivan and Bennett both said more resources will be needed to
continue current drug awareness efforts as well as bolster drug
treatment programs, though they declined to say how much money
should be directed to these areas.
   The survey covers the population age 12 and older living in
households in the 48 contiguous states. The results are based on
personal interviews and written questions answered by 8,814 people
_ half of whom were white, while the other half was evenly split
between blacks and Hispanics.
   The survey does not include homeless people, people living in
military installations, dormitories and institutions such as
hospitals and prisons and does not cover heroin use.
   The survey, conducted last fall, is the ninth in a series that
began in 1971. It is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, an HHS agency.
   Although survey participants are promised confidentiality,
Sullivan acknowledged ``some likely underreporting.'' But he said
the data is reliable in showing trends in drug use.
   ``I wouldn't bet the rent on the absolute numbers, but I would
on the trends,'' Sullivan said.
   According to the survey, the number of people who used
marijuana, cocaine or any other illicit drug within the month
previous to being surveyed dropped from 23 million in 1985 to 14.5
million in 1988.
   Those who used an illicit drug within the previous year fell
from 37 million to 28 million.
   The number of people who reported using the drug within the
previous month dropped by 50 percent, from 5.8 million in 1985 to
2.9 million last year, and the number who had used the drug in the
previous year fell 33 percent from 12 million to 8 million.
   But the survey indicated the number of people who used cocaine
once a week or more grew from 647,000 in 1985 to 862,000 last year.
The nmber of daily or almost-daily users rose from 246,000 in 1985
to 292,000 last year.
   The survey found that marijuana remains the most commonly used
illicit drug among Americans. Nearly 66 million Americans _ 33
percent _ have used it at least once. Casual marijuana use has been
decreasing since 1979.

<HEAD>Convictions Could Spur More Wall Street Racketeering Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The racketeering convictions of five former
officials of a small securities firm and a former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. trader could herald more racketeering cases against
Wall Street executives, law experts say.
   Monday's verdict came in the first case in which the federal
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act was used against
Wall Street professionals.
   The case overlapped the government's 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment of former Drexel financier Michael Milken.
Much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at Milken's
trial, scheduled to begin in March 1990.
   ``Until now the government has been using RICO effectively
against organized crime types,'' said Michael Goldsmith, a Brigham
Young University law professor and vice chairman of the American
Bar Association's racketeering law committee. ``This case reflects
a new effort to use it against white-collar folks. That is
appropriate.''
   Under the racketeering law, a person or business committing two
or more felonies can be charged with engaging in a pattern of
criminal activity.
   ``I think the government will use RICO more in these types of
cases,'' said Robert N. Kaplan, president of the National
Association of Securities and Commodities Law Attorneys.
   The law allows the government to seize many assets even if they
were not gained through the criminal activity. The jury in the case
is scheduled to return today to consider forfeiture.
   After 2{ days of deliberations, jurors found the six defendants
guilty of a total of 63 counts, including conspiracy, racketeering
and racketeering conspiracy and mail and wire fraud. The
racketeering counts carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine, in addition to possible forfeiture of assets.
   Convicted were former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, former
Princeton-Newport Partners LP partners Charles M. Zarzecki, James
Sutton Regan, Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul A. Berkman, and the
firm's controller, Steven B. Smotrich.
   Newberg and Zarzecki were acquitted of one count of wire fraud.
   The case involved a series of pre-arranged stock transactions
between 1984 and 1986. The government alleged they were designed to
generate phony tax losses.
   ``It's an outrage,'' said Zarzecki's lawyer, Paul Grand. ``They
didn't bother to look at the evidence, or the lack of it.''
   Regan's attorney, Theodore Wells, said all the defendants
planned to appeal.
   Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office,
said she could not comment on the verdict until after forfeiture
was decided.
   Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in
Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., went out of business
after the indictment was brought last August. Neither
Princeton-Newport nor Drexel was charged in the case.

<TEXT>
   Price controls and meat rationing ended
today and Poles braced for soaring food prices, the bitter cost of
the government's bold, swift push toward a free-market economy.
   Also today, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called for opposition
lawmakers in parliament's lower house, or Sejm, to vote against the
ruling Communist Party's nominee for prime minister, Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak.
   The brief statement was issued just minutes before the lawmaking
body was to meet to consider the nomination.
   Walesa's statement said he would have supported Kiszczak _ the
country's top law officer _ for president, but: ``I am against Gen.
Kiszczak's candidacy for prime minister.''
   The statement did not elaborate, but Walesa has urged President
Wojciech Jaruzelski to acede to the popular will and let Solidarity
form a government. The free trade union movement won overwhelming
electoral approval in June.
   If elected, Kiszczak will have to deal with growing social
tensions prompted by rising costs that are anticipated because of
the government's decision to lift price controls.
   Shoppers stood in lines for hours Monday to try to take
advantage of the last day of artificially low food prices, but many
came up empty-handed.
   The Solidarity-led opposition movement opposed the abrupt
lifting of price controls, arguing that it could plunge the country
into turmoil. Consumer goods are scarce and annual inflation has
topped 100 percent.
   The new pricing policy took effect a day after the Communist
Party named Kiszczak its candidate to lead the next government.
   Newly appointed party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the outgoing
prime minister, recommended that Kiszczak succeed him.
   As party chief, Rakowski succeeded Jaruzelski, who parliament
elected by a one-vote margin to the powerful new post of president
last month.
   Kiszczak, interior minister since 1981, is known as a Jaruzelski
loyalist. He represented authorities in April talks with Walesa
that resulted in the free trade union movement's reinstatement
after a seven-year ban and Poland's freest elections in seven
decades.
   Kiszczak told The Associated Press Monday that if approved, he
is not sure how long it would him take to form a government.
   ``It is not an easy task,'' he said. ``You have to satisfy many
sides. It may be a week or two.''
   Deputy Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Solidarity lawmakers in
parliament, said the opposition would vote against Kiszczak or
abstain.
   Solidarity lawmakers came under sharp criticism from some
followers for allowing Jaruzelski to become president.
   Geremek said the ruling Communist coalition has the votes to
elect Kiszczak since it has a 299-161 advantage over Solidarity in
the Sejm under rules that gave the opposition limited participation
in the government.
   Solidarity won all but one of the seats it was allowed to
contest in June election and holds all but one seat in the
100-member Senate.
   The union movement has called on Jaruzelski to let it form a new
government. But the general has refused, saying Poland's Communist
allies would disapprove.
   Nervous consumers lined up for hours Monday to buy meat, sugar
and other basic goods before price controls were lifted. Many said
they did not known they would be able to afford the new prices.
   ``It's such a mess that one is really afraid to think what will
happen next,'' said a Wroclaw shopper interviewed by state
television.
   The controversial ``marketization'' program, pushed by Rakowski
and endorsed by the party, is designed to fight shortages by
introducing free-market mechanisms.
   Poland's mainly private farmers, who have cut back on profitless
meat and grain sales to the state, are free to sell to whomever
they want at whatever prices they can negotiate, as an incentive to
increase production.
   Government food subsidies are to remain stable, however, and
state-owned stores and food processors are supposed to pass their
added purchasing costs to consumers.
   Solidarity and the independent farmers union Rural Solidarity
backed the reform, but oppose its rapid implementation.
   ``There are no conditions ... for a free market to work,'' said
Gabriel Janowski of Rural Solidarity. He said that for most farmers
there is only one potential buyer for their produce, and these
``monopolies (are) destroying the countryside.''
   Late Monday, the Sejm passed by a 335-29 vote legislation
designed to blunt inflation. The law provides income compensation
for up to 80 percent of the increase in the cost of living.
   The program that takes effect today includes abolishing meat
ration coupons, which since 1981 permitted each family member the
right to buy 5{ pounds of meat monthly from state-owned shops at
controlled prices.
   Consumers always could buy additional meat at higher prices from
private stores, but it was too expensive for many. In effect, all
meat will now be at or near the free-market price.
   For example, 2.2 pounds of rationed pork roast might cost $1.20
if a consumer was lucky enough to find it in a state store, but
$5.90 to $9.50 at a farmers' bazaar. The average monthly salary is
about $127.
   Some food items still will be subject to price controls: bread,
low-fat milk, cottage cheese and milk products for infants, the
government said.

<HEAD>Mothers of Missing Youths Fly to Florida to See Mysterious Photograph</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two mothers of missing youths flew to
Florida to look at a photograph of two bound and gagged young
people shown on a national television program that they say may be
their children.
   Michael Henley Jr., 10, disappeared on a turkey hunt with his
father in April 1988 in the mountains south of their hometown of
Grants, about 60 miles west of Albuquerque. Tara Calico, then 19,
disappeared five months later while bicycling on a country road
near Belen, 30 miles south of here.
   The FBI, meanwhile, said it will join the investigation of the
youths' disappearances.
   The mothers were to meet with law enforcement officials today in
Port St. Joe, Fla. They had seen the photograph on the ``tabloid''
news show, ``A Current Affair.''
   Pat Doel, mother of Ms. Calico, and Marty Henley flew to Florida
to see firsthand the photograph they believe shows their children
bound and gagged in a van. A woman who found the photo June 15 in a
Port St. Joe parking lot said a white van had been parked over the
spot where she found the Polaroid snapshot.
   ``I can't give up on her,'' Mrs. Doel said Monday. ``I thought
it was her when I first saw her. But then when I saw the puffiness
around her eyes I didn't think it looked like her. But then I
looked at a photo of her when she first woke up and it looked like
her.''
   ``We've always thought we'd get Tara back some way somehow. This
is the first step,'' she said.
   She and Mrs. Henley boarded a plane together Monday afternoon.
   Mrs. Henley said in an interview Monday on ``A Current Affair''
that at first she didn't want to think the boy in the photo looked
like her son, Michael, ``but it looks like him. From the photo
you've shown us, we're as certain as we can be.''
   The nationally syndicated television show had first shown the
photo Friday, triggering the response from the Henleys and the
Doels.
   FBI spokesman Doug Beldon said Monday that the agency would
provide background information on the Henley disappearance and make
available its laboratory and identification division in Washington,
D.C.
   He said if it is determined that the photograph is of Henley or
Calico, a federal kidnapping investigation would follow. He said
such federal probes are predicated on abductions that cross state
lines.

<HEAD>Repairs Started on Exxon Valdez</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marine chemist collected air samples from the
cargo tanks of the Exxon Valdez to make sure it's safe for shipyard
workers to prepare the tanker for a nine-month repair job.
   The samples were collected Monday to ensure no dangerous gases
are present in the ship's holds when dry-dock welding begins, said
Al Lutter, senior vice president at National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co.
   Analysis of the samples is expected to be done by Wednesday, he
said.
   The sampling marked the start of a repair process that Exxon
Shipping Co. officials hope will allow the supertanker to return to
service. Repairs are estimated to cost $25 million.
   Once the ship's cargo tanks are certified as gas-free, workers
will begin welding to the hull approximately 24 brackets that will
help prop up the vessel when it goes into dry dock.
   About 30 percent of the ship's bottom either is gone or has been
weakened so badly in the aftermath of the March 24 grounding that
it can't be supported in dry dock without the brackets, Exxon and
National Steel officials said.
   Divers then will survey the ship's hull to determine the extent
of the damage on the 987-foot-long tanker, Lutter said.
   A piece of granite reef the size of a small van also must be
removed before the Valdez can be moved into the dry dock where the
ship was built in 1986.
   The tanker likely will be moved into the dock during a four-day
period of high tides that starts Aug. 14, said Lutter.
   The Valdez, which caused the nation's worst oil spill by dumping
about 11 million gallons of crude into Alaskan waters, is moored at
a National Steel pier following its discharge-free transit Sunday
through San Diego Bay.
   Its entrance was delayed three weeks by oil slicks that appeared
near the vessel off the Southern California coast. To enable the
Valdez to enter the harbor, divers also had to remove massive steel
slabs that dangled from the hull and extended as much as 70 feet
below the surface.

<HEAD>Officials Take Measures to Avert Railroad Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Railroad and union officials averted a threatened
strike by rail workers with promises of improved wages and living
conditions, the head of the country's trade unions said today.
   The possibility of a strike on the Moscow-Leningrad line was
raised Sunday by the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda, which
cited worker discontent over wages and work conditions.
   Trade union chief Stepan Shalayev, interviewed at today session
of the Supreme Soviet legislature, said, ``there were demands,
threats by some work collectives, but the Railway Ministry and
union took measures to review the demands in time and took
decisions to prevent strikes.''
   He said there were no rail workers on strike and ``today, the
situation is not threatening any stoppage of the railroad.''
   Railway Minister Nikolai S. Konarev was shown on the national
television news program Vremya Monday night talking by intercom
from his Moscow office to leaders of railway services of the Soviet
Union's 32 railroads.
   He was shown admonishing the 15,830 managers for failing to
adequately take care of workers and their families.
   ``Violations of the normal regime has almost become the rule,''
he said. ``You aren't allowed to do that, but you do it. Left and
right you give orders which in the end lead to dissatisfaction of
locomotive brigades and their families,'' he said.
   The news commentator said Konarev spoke with workers'
representatives nationwide on Friday to hear their demands. Pravda
said complaints included not being given adequate time to eat and
wage discrepencies among workers.
   ``The ministry agreed to improve the living conditions of the
railway men and the tension was removed to some extent,'' the
commentator said.
   Konarev, whose nomination to retain the post of Railway Minister
was rejected by the Supreme Soviet July 5, said on Vremya, ``the
country lives, works and is fed from wheels. This I say with just
one meaning, you must be respectful of trains.''
   Konarev will keep his job until a new candidate is nominated by
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Although President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sided with coal miners
who went on a 10-day strike two weeks ago, he warned against a
strike by rail workers.
   In a speech July 19, Gorbachev noted there had been calls for a
rail strike Aug. 1 and said such a strike would damage efforts to
reform the Soviet economy and improve conditions for everyone.
   There are 31 official trade unions in the Soviet Union
representing 138.9 million workers, according to official
statistics. The unions long have done little but follow official
policy, and workers have begun voicing their demands outside the
official union structure.

   The dollar was stable at lower levels today, but
dealers anticipated further drops reflecting declining U.S.
interest rates.
   Gold was slightly weaker in quiet trading.
   Several major U.S. banks cut their prime lending rates a half a
point Monday to 10.5 percent.
   ``We are constantly getting confirmation that the U.S. economy
is no longer in a boom phase, and that interest rates are
falling,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   ``Once the yield advantage is gone, there is no more reason to
hold dollars.''
   The dollar dropped 2.45 yen on the Tokyo exchange, closing today
at 135.95 yen. Later in London, the dollar firmed to 136.70 yen.
   In London, the pound sterling cost $1.6580, compared to $1.6665
late Monday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8665 West German marks, up from 1.8655
   _1.6097 Swiss francs, up from 1.6065

   Gold opened in London at $368.60, up from $368.25 a troy ounce
late Monday. At mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $369.95 an ounce.
   There was no trading today in Zurich, because of a national
holiday. Gold sold at $368.25 an ounce there late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose the equivalent of $1.62 an ounce
to close today at $371.26.
   Silver was trading in London at $5.24 a troy ounce, up sharply
from Monday's $5.13.

<HEAD>Alleged Cuban Agent Says He Masterminded Mariel Boatlift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader in the 1980 ``freedom
flotilla'' says he was actually a spy who had given Fidel Castro
the idea for the boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans, some of
them criminals, to the United States.
   Napoleon Vilaboa, 52, sailed his yacht to Mariel to pick up
Cubans and later spoke frequently on radio stations in Miami's
Little Havana in 1980, urging exiles to participate in the boatlift.
   After the boatlifts ferried Cubans to Key West, he disappeared
from the headlines and from Miami.
   Nine years later, Vilaboa has returned to Miami to say those who
suspected him after his disappearance were right _ he was a Cuban
government agent _ and that he had masterminded the boatlift, he
told The Miami Herald in a story published Monday.
   Vilaboa, who is living in Miami Beach, said that he eventually
became a lieutenant colonel in Cuban intelligence and worked to
export revolution through the Cuban Institute of Friendship with
Peoples.
   One former police official said he was not surprised by
Vilaboa's admission.
   ``We were looking for him everywhere,'' said Sergio Pinon,
formerly with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. ``We knew
all along he was a Cuban agent. He was very dedicated to the
revolution. If he's coming out now, I think it's because he was
told to.''
   Pinon also said Vilaboa was suspected of stealing money from
exiles looking for help to free their families in Cuba. Vilaboa
denied stealing any money.
   Vilaboa said he met with Castro at the Havana Riviera Hotel in
April 1980, after 10,000 Cubans had stormed the Peruvian embassy
trying to get out the country.
   ``Fidel was violent, desperate,'' Vilaboa recounted. ``He said
`What do we think we should do with these embassy people?'''
   Vilaboa said he suggested something like the 1965 Camarioca
exodus, in which 5,000 people came to Florida through that Cuban
port.
   Days later, his contact told him Castro had agreed, and decided
the refugees should leave from Mariel.
   Castro used the boatlift to rid himself of thousands of
criminals and mentally ill people, as well as thousands of people
who for one reason or another were unhappy with conditions in Cuba.
   After the boatlift, Vilaboa moved to Costa Rica, where he said
he was a $3,000-a-month ``consultant to the Cuban government,
arranging exports and running a restaurant.''
   Vilaboa said he has come forward with his story because quiet
efforts to work with anti-Castro forces to change the government
had failed.
   He said his new mission would be to denounce other pro-Castro
infiltrators in the exile community.

   A man surrendered to police after holding
officers at bay for almost 18 hours while shooting at them from his
home.
   Police arrested Joseph Smith, 50, who was armed with two rifles
and a handgun, on Monday afternoon, said Sgt. Christopher Buck.
Smith was to be hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation, police
said.
   Police from the neighboring city of Highland Park had gone to
Smith's house Sunday evening to arrest him for assault with intent
to murder, officials said.
   ``He apparently was ejected from a theater, went outside and
fired shots at the theater,'' Detroit police Sgt. George Anthony
said.
   Smith opened fire on the Highland Park police, and later shot
into a Detroit police car that went to the scene. He also shot at a
police helicopter that hovered over his northeast Detroit home,
officials said.
   No injuries were reported at the theater or at the Smith's home,
Anthony said.
   Police sealed off the area and evacuated several dozen area
residents during the siege.

   Foreign Secretary John Major of Britain called
again today for release of all hostages in the Mideast.
   The archbishop of Canterbury also appealed for restraint after
the reported killing of a U.S. Marine hostage in Lebanon.
Archbishop Robert Runcie's personal envoy, Terry Waite, is one of
the Westerners held captive in that country.
   There were also threats to kill Waite today, but Runcie had no
comment. The Anglican envoy disappeared in January 1987 while
trying to free other captives.
   ``We are in touch with a number of countries in the region and
with the U.S. administration,'' Major said in a statement released
by the Foreign Office. ``I urge any country with influence to use
it to secure the safe return of all hostages.''
   Concern for the hostages was heightened Monday after the
purported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. His
captors said he was killed in retaliation for Israel's seizure of
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Moslem cleric linked to terrorism.
   Waite's brother, David, appealed again today for all sides to
release their hostages.
   John Waite, a cousin of the hostage, said in a television
interview that, ``We believe the Israelis should give up the sheik.
He is a hostage and he should be released along with all other
hostages.''

<HEAD>Govt Employees Hold Day of Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of government employees
launched a nationwide protest today to demand higher pay. President
Corazon Aquino said the country cannot afford to pay better wages.
   About 12,000 striking workers rallied in front of the Senate
building to press their demand, police said, joining public school
teachers who walked off the job eight days ago over salary demands.
   Officials said the extent of the walkout was unclear. About 25
percent of the 1,350 employees at Ninoy Aquino International
Airport joined the walkout but operations there were unaffected,
according to airport manager Eduardo Carrascoso.
   Strike leaders claimed 75 percent of the airport staff joined
the walkout. Union leaders at the government-run Philippine General
Hospital said all sections there were affected by the strike except
the intensive care unit.
   Organizers said the walkout affected at least 28 government
agencies, including the University of the Philippines, the weather
service, the social security system, the Central Bank, the National
Food Authority, and the Department of Labor.
   Eric Torres, chairman of the militant Alliance of Concerned
Teachers, claimed 104,000 teachers nationwide joined the protest,
affecting 800 schools, colleges and universities.
   Government workers are asking for an increase in the minimum
monthly pay from $66.70 to $133. Public school teachers are seeking
an increase from $95 a month to $214.
   The government defines poverty as a family income of $185 per
month. Philippine salaries are among the lowest in non-communist
Southeast Asian countries.
   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged today that state salaries were well
below those of the private sector but said the government would not
bow to the strikers' demands.
   Budget Secretary Guillermo Carague said the government had
budgeted $285 million for salaries. But Patricia Santo Tomas,
chairman of the Civil Service Commission, said meeting teachers'
demands alone would cost the government $1.8 billion.
   Strike leaders have called for cuts in the budget for defense
and foreign debt service to make more money available for salaries.

   Nations expressed horror, revulsion and
skepticism today after a pro-Iranian group in Lebanon claimed it
hanged Lt. Col. William R. Higgins because Israel refused to free a
captured Shiite Moslem cleric.
   The Soviet Union denounced the reported hanging and also faulted
Israel for kidnapping Shiite Moslem cleric Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid.
   In Tunis, an adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat denounced the
reported execution of Higgins but said Israel bore the
responsibility.
   ``We condemn the abduction of innocents and the taking of
hostages and those who are the authors and we condemn even more the
State of Israel which practices state terrorism,'' Bassam Abu
Sharif said.
   Higgins' captors, who call themselves the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, claimed they hanged Higgins on Monday because
Israel refused to release Obeid.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev read a brief
statement saying, ``We resolutely denounce this inhuman action.
   ``The fact that the aggravation of the situation in Lebanon,
caused specifically by the abduction of Shiite leader Sheikh Obeid
by Israeli commandos, has led to an escalation of acts of violence
and terror and evokes profound concern,'' the statement said.
   Condemnation of the purported hanging was widespread.
   ``It's an absolutely barbaric act, consistent with the worst
dimensions of terrorism,'' said Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of
Canada said of the Higgins death claim.
   Japan condemned the reported hanging as ``extremely shameful and
inhuman.''
   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that
``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and abduction.''
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed ``outrage
and revulsion ... that an innocent man, serving the United Nations
in the cause of peace, should be murdered in this fashion.''
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attached
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was
abducted near Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon,
said ``If it's true it's one of the saddest days for all
peacekeepers in the world.''
   British Foreign Secretary John Major said in London that, if the
reports were true, ``this is cold-blooded murder, brazen savagery
of the worst sort and quite unforgivable.''
   Syria, which supported Iran in its war with Iraq, said:
``Killing Higgins, who was not guilty of anything, is a crime that
violates all humanitarian principles and norms.''
   Iran did not comment immediately on the death report.
   Earlier, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the threat to
Higgins ``has nothing to do with us,'' but added that Israel should
be pressed to release Obeid. ``We condemn any kind of kidnapping or
death threat,'' he said.
   Many officials questioned the veracity of the claim Higgins was
killed Monday, which was accompanied by a poor quality videotape
showing a man hanging from a scaffold.
   There have been reports that his captors killed the American
last year.
   Nasouh Majali, Jordan's information minister, said of the
reported kiling: ``This is horrible.'' Before the report that
Higgins had been killed, Majali called the abduction of Obeid ``an
act of terror.''
   The Israelis ``are condemning terror and they are using the same
means,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson of Sweden said killing Higgins
was ``a heinous crime'' that should be condemned along with Obeid's
abduction.

   Thousands of soldiers and firefighters from Alaska to Florida
mobilized today to help battle fires that had charred nearly
140,000 acres in four Western states with no sign of letting up.
   World War II-era bombers swooped to treetop level to drop fire
retardant over Idaho's fires, and helicopters dumped huge buckets
of water.
   Nearly all of the West's forest firefighting crews were on front
lines in Idaho, Oregon, California and Washington, prompting the
call for help from elsewhere, said strategists at the Boise
Interagency Fire Center directing the fire fights.
   Crews from 19 states had arrived in the region by early today,
including 525 firefighters from Alaska. They joined 9,800
firefighters already on the lines.
   About 1,000 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were summoned to
Oregon for on-the-job training before being thrown on to the front
lines. National Guardsmen also were called out for duty in Idaho
and Oregon.
   ``We're in for a long haul,'' said Dave Olson of the Payette
National Forest in Idaho, where more than 200 fires continued to
burn. ``It's getting serious, and it's getting tough to deal with
these fires.''
   These fires were still no match to last year's, the most
expensive ever in firefighting costs, but forecasters said a dry
August with lightning strikes could rapidly escalate the damage.
Fires have charred more than 1.3 million acres this year in the
contiguous United States, compared with 2.1 million acres by this
time last year.
   Lightning last week set many of the blazes.
   Lightning ignited a firestorm that charred 10,000 acres in
central Idaho, including much of the small resort town of Lowman,
about 70 miles northeast of Boise. Residents who returned Monday to
what was left of their homes found that 25 structures were
destroyed.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus left the National Governors' Association
conference in Chicago one day early to deal with the fires that he
said were ``totally out of control.''
   An estimated 136,000 acres of forest, brush and rangeland were
burning or charred in the four states, including 55,000 acres in
Idaho, the fire center said.
   About 120 miles north of Lowman in the Payette National Forest,
crews worked to save a second town from burning. The mining town of
Warren, population 25, was nearly surrounded by a 4,200-acre
cluster of three fires.
   ``There are engines in place. There are pumps, hoses, foam units
in place,'' said Payette spokesman Olson.
   Nearby, another tiny Idaho community was cut off today as fires
closed the road to Yellow Pine, which has about two dozen permanent
residents.
   In northeastern Oregon, at least five major fires and several
smaller ones burned across 60,000 acres, forcing the evacuation of
some rural homes and threatening the watershed for the city of La
Grande, authorities said.
   Last Wednesday's thunderstorms produced about 7,800 lightning
strikes in the region.
   About 2,900 firefighters were battling blazes in the
Wallowa-Whitman and the Malheur national forests near the towns of
Baker, Unity, Enterprise and John Day, said Forest Service
spokesman Mike Ferris.
   The biggest blaze, a 18,240-acre fire five miles south of Baker,
kept residents of about 15 homes from their houses.
   In California's Sierra Nevada foothills, firefighters today
declared they had contained a fire that blackened 11,700 acres of
brush and grassland and destroyed seven homes. Crews finished
cutting a line of bare earth around the blaze early today and
expected full control Wednesday, said Forest Service spokeswoman
Margie Clack.
   The fire, which last week had forced nearly 2,500 residents to
flee, destroyed about 15 sheds, barns and outbuildings in addition
to the homes. Most evacuees returned home Sunday and Monday.
   Many of the firefighters have left the site, about 30 miles east
of Fresno, to battle a fire 25 miles southeast at Balch Camp. That
blaze has burned more than 2,000 acres of rugged terrain and was
only 15 percent contained.
   Both fires were believed to have been caused by arson.
   In Washington state, near the Canadian border, firefighters
hoped to contain an 850-acre fire by tonight, said Greg Thayer of
the Forest Service. Trails were completed around 85 percent of the
fire.
   Washington state sent 30 firefighters and three helicopters to
fires in Oregon and Idaho.
   The fire center in Boise reported early today that firefighters
also had arrived from 19 other states: Michigan, Wisconsin, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Alaska.

   A military helicopter crashed in a
thunderstorm and killed all 17 people aboard, including a colonel
and nine members of his family, the army said today.
   Victims of Monday's crash included three brigadiers, or one-star
generals, in addition to Col. Abdel-Latif Bushara Ahmed and his
family, the army said.
   Senior officers often use military transportation for family
members because of the unreliability of civilian transport in this
East African country.
   A statement from military headquarters said the aircraft crashed
during a 260-mile flight to Khartoum from Kassala in eastern Sudan
near the Ethiopian border. It gave no details about where it
crashed.
   The statement said the helicopter, piloted by a brigadier, flew
into the thunderstorm and crashed. Storms with strong winds lashed
Khartoum on Monday night.

<HEAD>Mob Calls for Death of Psychiatric Patient Charged With Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatric patient charged in the
fatal knifing of a 9-year-old girl encountered a mob screaming for
his death as he left court, headed for a hospital for the
criminally insane.
   Mental Health Commissioner Michael Hogan later Monday insisted
proper procedures had been followed at Connecticut Valley Hospital
before David Peterson wandered away.
   But he said the attack on Jessica Short, ``the most devastating
event in the hospital's 100-year history,'' shows a need for
tighter security.
   Peterson, 37, was ordered held on $750,000 bail Monday on murder
and weapons charges in the slaying of Jessica on Friday as she
attended a street fair. He was ordered to undergo psychiatric
evaluation.
   Peterson was whisked into the courthouse under heavy guard as
two police sharpshooters perched on a rooftop.
   After the arraignment, a mob of 35 to 40 people ran alongside
the squad car taking him to a Hartford jail, shouting obscenities
and ``Kill him, kill him.''
   ``I think they should kill him,'' said Stephanie Kamp, 18, who
said she saw the stabbing. ``There going to put him right back in
CVH and in a couple of years he'll be right back out.''
   Peterson was to be transferred to Whiting Forensic Institute in
Middletown, a state hospital for the criminally insane.
   Peterson had been ordered confined at sprawling, unfenced
Connecticut Valley Hospital for up to 15 years last year after
being found innocent by reason of insanity on assault and burglary
charges.
   Hogan said Peterson left his assigned building without
permission.
   ``The hospital is not a prison,'' he said, and the privileges
given to each patient are reviewed daily. ``This system has worked
well for thousands of patients over many years and is used in many
hospitals, but there is no question that it did not work in this
case to prevent a horrible occurrence.''
   ``The killing has had a traumatic effect on our patients and
staff,'' Hogan said. ``Many patients fear that they will be seen as
guilty by association.''
   As for the need to tighten security, he said, ``The specific
changes must be carefully considered.''
   According to family members, Peterson's first run-in with the
law came after he stabbed a fellow high school student in 1971.
After that he was in and out of mental hospitals, said his
sister-in-law, Ellen Peterson.

   American military personnel stationed overseas
will be counted in the 1990 census, the Commerce Department
announced today.
   The Census Bureau will work with the Pentagon to count the 1.2
million to 1.6 million military and civilian Defense Department
workers overseas, the bureau said.
   The question of counting overseas military personnel has led to
sharp debate in Congress, and the announcement came at the start of
a hearing on legislation to require them to be counted.
   In the past, service members overseas generally have not been
included in census counts, which are used to apportion seats in the
House of Representatives.
   That is because census officials considered it impossible to
determine accurately in which state an individual should be
counted. Many military people move often.
   The Census Bureau said it will investigate ways to make that
judgment in the 1990 census. Possibilities include listing a
service person's last state of residence for more than six months,
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.

   President Bush, pondering ways to retaliate
for the reported hanging of Lt. Col. William Higgins by Lebanese
kidnappers, faces the frustration his predecessors experienced in
deciding how to international terrorists, experts say.
   One administration source said today that a military response
was ``in the realm of the possible,'' but that Bush had not decided
on a course of action among the options before him.
   ``No one is tilted in that direction,'' the source, who declined
to be identified, said of some sort of armed intervention. ``It's
on the menu. No one's ordered it ... We're not leaning necessarily
toward anything. People are discussing the options. We are not at
the specific choosing stage.''
   A second official, who also demanded anonymity, said the problem
with a military strike is that some of the U.S. or foreign hostages
are likely being held ``at the sites you might strike'' to
retaliate against their terrorist captors.
   And he said of a possible rescue attempt, ``most people have
thought that's kind of ruled out'' in part because the hostages are
believed held at different sites by different groups.
   ``It's very clear the options are not attractive for the United
States,'' this official, adding that the diplomatic approach seems
the most viable.
   Private analysts note there are no easy answers to America's
latest terrorist challenge.
   ``Rhetoric is cheap, but decisive action is difficult. I don't
know if there is very much we can do in the short term,'' said
Geoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan administration official who works
for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   President Reagan pledged at the time of his inaugural more than
eight years ago to take ``swift and effective retribution'' against
terrorists but often backed away from bold action, worried that the
cure might be worse than the disease.
   He was concerned that the United States might strike at the
wrong target, kill innocent civilians and jeopardize the lives of
the remaining Americans held hostage in Lebanon. With the reported
death of Higgins, eight American hostages remain.
   According to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Bush told congressional
leaders Monday night that it's a ``98 percent probability'' that
Higgins was slain as his Shiite Moslem captors claimed.
   ``The options for retaliation are virtually non-existent,'' said
Noel Koch, a former Pentagon official and terrorism expert.
   L. Paul Bremer, who headed the State Department's
counter-terrorism office under Reagan, said Bush's problem has been
the absence of adequate intelligence from Beirut's shadowy
underworld, where the American hostages are believed held.
   He said the administration should not rule out the abduction of
terrorist ringleaders as punishment for Higgins' reported execution.
   Very little is known about the group that claimed to have killed
Higgins, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   James Blackwell, deputy director for political military studies
at Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ``We are
really caught between a rock and a hard place.''
   ``The military option is there but it is a limited one,'' he
said, because the U.S. must avoid hurting innocent people and
doesn't want to harm the other hostages.
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
said after the meeting with congressional leaders that Bush was
considering several options but he declined to identify them.
   ``I don't think anything has been ruled out at this point,''
Boren said.
   Complicating the quest for an appropriate response were doubts
about whether Higgins was killed Monday or months ago. Israeli
officials strongly suspect that Higgins's death may date as far
back as July or December 1988.
   Higgins' kidnappers maintained the purported execution was in
retaliation for the kidnapping by Israeli commandos of Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite leader who was seized at his home 72
hours before the announced hanging of Higgins.
   Shortly before Higgins' execution was reported, Israeli
officials said their government was offering to exchange its Shiite
Moslem captives from Lebanon for Israeli prisoners of war and all
foreign hostages held by Shiite groups.
   But after the meeting with Bush, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, indicated that the president does not consider
negotiating with terrorists to be an appropriate option.
   Mitchell said Bush ``strongly reaffirmed his belief in the
appropriate policy of not negotiating with terrorists in any
circumstances.''

   Voters today nominated candidates for the late
Claude Pepper's seat in a race that could send a Cuban-American to
Congress for the first time.
   Polls showed Cuban-Americans leading the crowded field among
Republicans and Democrats alike in the district, where Hispanics
have come to represent about half the voters some 30 years after an
influx of Cuban emigres began.
   Turnout had been projected at just 18 percent, meaning seven
Democrats were vying for 18,000 votes, while the four Republicans
battled for 14,000 votes, but the number of voters going to the
polls in a drizzle was even lighter than expected.
   ``You can count it on your fingertips,'' said veteran Miami
Beach political strategist Gerald Schwartz. ``You can almost
literally talk to everybody who's going to vote.''
   Each party will hold a runoff Aug. 15 if no candidate wins a
majority. The Democrat and Republican winners will meet in an Aug.
29 special election.
   Pepper, a Democrat, first won the seat in 1962 and held it until
his death on May 30 at 88.
   David Leahy, elections supervisor for Dade County, said his 18
percent turnout projection was a guess because there hasn't been a
special congressional election in recent history, and never in
August, a vacation month.
   Nearly half the voters will have only the House race on their
ballot, with a smaller portion of the district having a special
state Senate election and an even smaller section also having a
state House primary _ for the GOP only.
   Hispanic turnout is traditionally high, Leahy said, and there is
the added attraction of the chance to elect the first
Cuban-American to Congress. The district includes central Miami,
including the heavily Cuban Little Havana area.
   On the Democratic side, the lone Hispanic is Cuban-born former
city commissioner Rosario Kennedy, the leader in virtually all
polls. However, winning a majority ``against six other candidates
is nearly impossible,'' said Phil Hamersmith, a Kennedy strategist.
   Pepper's niece, Jo Ann Pepper, has been running second to Ms.
Kennedy in most polls and said her campaign lacked money for a late
TV blitz. Attorney Gerald Richman, third in most polls, put as much
as $180,000 into television.
   Ironically, neither Ms. Kennedy nor Ms. Pepper could vote today.
Although lenient congressional rules allowed them to qualify for
the race, they didn't meet local residency requirements.
   Far back in the polls were black professor Marvin Dunn, black
real estate agent Sonny Wright, businessman Bernard Anscher and
striking Eastern Airlines pilot John Paul Rosser.
   On the Republican side, state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
concentrated on get-out-the-vote efforts Monday in hopes of winning
a majority against opponents led by fellow Cuban-American Carlos
Perez, a wealthy activist for conservative causes who was endorsed
by former National Security Council aide Oliver North.
   Also on the GOP ballot are insurance broker David Fleischer and
former North Miami Mayor John Stembridge.
   The elections office said there are 100,198 registered Democrats
in the district, with 16,028 Hispanics, 32,183 blacks and 51,987
non-Latin whites.
   There are 71,620 registered Republicans, with 46,738 Hispanics,
23,656 non-Latin whites, and 1,226 blacks.
   The figures for Hispanics include only those who were born in
Hispanic nations. Unofficial estimates that count second-generation
Hispanics suggest Hispanics make up about half the district's
registered voters.

   Gwendolyn S. King took office today as
commissioner of the Social Security Administration with a promise
to provide better service for the millions of Americans who receive
monthly benefits.
   Mrs. King, a former congressional, state and White House aide,
was sworn in by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan, who said the nation's retirement and disability benefits
system rests in ``capable, caring hands.''
   The new commissioner, who took the oath of office at Social
Security headquarters near Baltimore, said, ``I pledge to you that
SSA will serve only one special interest _ the public interest.''
   ``My goal is a fairer, more efficient and humane Social Security
system.''
   The SSA administers both the Social Security old age, survivors
and disability benefits program and the Supplemental Security
Income program for needy people who are aged, blind or disabled.
   More than 38 million Americans collect monthly Social Security
checks totaling about $230 billion each year and 4.1 million
recieve monthly Supplemental Security Income benefits totaling more
than $14 billion a year.
   During the Reagan years, the agency pared its workforce by about
20 percent to 65,000 employees as part of a program to streamline
and modernize operations. Critics, however, complain that the
remaining employees are overworked, morale is low and the quality
of service has declined.
   Mrs. King promised agency employees she would provide
``leadership which respects and trusts its employees; leadership
that will lead, but will also listen.''
   ``You are entitled to leadership that stands up for you,
especially when you think you may be left standing alone,'' she
said.
   Mrs. King succeeds Dorcas Hardy, who announced in June that she
would resign effective Monday.

   The parents of two missing New Mexico
youths said today that a mysterious photograph of a bound boy and
girl appeared to show their loved ones.
   The snapshot, which a woman claimed to have found June 15 in a
parking lot near where a van had been parked, was shown Friday on
the syndicated TV program ``A Current Affair.''
   The parents of Michael Henley Jr. and Tara Calico flew to this
Florida Panhandle community Monday and visited police to view the
Polaroid snapshot.
   They emerged to tell reporters they are convinced the photo
shows their missing children, although they want experts to view it
as well.
   Michael Henley Jr., 10, disappeared on a turkey hunt with his
father in April 1988 in the mountains near their hometown of
Grants, N.M. Ms. Calico, then 19, disappeared five months later
while bicycling on a country road near her hometown of Belen, N.M.
   ``We hope it's a step closer to finding him,'' said Michael
Henley, father of the missing boy. Henley was accompanied by his
wife, Marty Henley.
   Pat Doel, mother of Ms. Calico, agreed the young woman shown
bound with her hands behind her back appeared to be her daughter.
She added that the two pictured appeared to be well-fed and in good
shape.
   On Monday, FBI spokesman Doug Beldon in Albuquerque, N.M., said
the agency would provide background information on the Henley
disappearance and make available its laboratory and identification
division in Washington.
   Before leaving for Port St. Joe, Mrs. Doel said the more she
looked at TV copies of the photo, the more convinced she was that
the young woman was her daughter.
   ``I can't give up on her,'' Mrs. Doel said. ``I thought it was
her when I first saw her. But then when I saw the puffiness around
her eyes I didn't think it looked like her. But then I looked at a
photo of her when she first woke up and it looked like her.''
   ``We've always thought we'd get Tara back some way somehow. This
is the first step,'' she said.
   Mrs. Henley said in an interview Monday on ``A Current Affair''
that at first she didn't want to think the boy in the photo looked
like her son, but she added, ``From the photo you've shown us,
we're as certain as we can be.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today suggested
Israel was conducting negotiations with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
groups in Lebanon to obtain the release of Israeli prisoners and
Western hostages.
   In Beirut, the Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella group for
kidnappers of Westerners in Lebanon, rejected an Israeli swap offer
for a kidnapped Shiite cleric and two companions and said Israel
and the United States were responsible for any retaliation against
Western hostages by Islamic groups.
   ``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid and his two colleagues be released,'' Hezbollah, or Party of
God, said in a statement.
   Shamir, asked whether Israel was engaged in contacts with Shiite
groups in Lebanon, Shamir told reporters ``there are permanent
contacts with various factors about the release of the hostages.''
   Israel radio said the contacts were related to Israel's offer
Monday to trade all the Shiite prisoners it is holding for three
Israeli soldiers and the foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   Also today, sources said there were sharp divisions in the
government over its decision to abduct Obeid. The action also has
drawn fire from officials in Washington.
   The Israeli offer was made as Shiite extremists in Lebanon said
they hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins because Israel
refused to release a Shiite Moslem cleric its commandos kidnapped
Friday from his south Lebanon home.
   The captors of another American later said they would kill him
unless Israel frees Obeid, who Israeli sources say was involved in
Higgins' abduction.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, suggested that the contacts with
Shiite groups were indirect, through the International Red Cross
and the U.S. government. He would not say if there had been any
direct talks.
   Israel is believed to be holding 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems in
Israel as well as about 300 in south Lebanon, security sources in
Lebanon said on condition of anonymity.
   Shamir defended Israel's decision to kidnap Obeid and two of his
aides.
   ``The only purpose of our operation was to free our captured
soldiers. If, at the same time, we manage to set free other
hostages, we will be happy. There is a common interest and a
communal goal with the United States,'' Shamir told reporters
outside an aluminum factory he visited in Jerusalem.
   Groups claiming to hold two other hostages, American Joseph
Cicippio and Anglican envoy Terry Waite of Britain, have threatened
to execute them unless Israel frees Obeid.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who met with U.S. Ambassador
William Brown, told the parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee today he believed the groups may be making threats
against hostages who were already dead, defense sources said.
   The U.S. reaction has included strong criticism of Israel's
failure to coordinate its operation or consider the possibility
that American hostages could be harmed.
   After the claim of Higgins' death was made, Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas criticized the abduction of Obeid:
``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis
one of these days would be refreshing.''
   White House officials avoided direct criticism of Israel, but
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is fair to say that
many people do share the senator's concerns.'' He would not
elaborate.
   Shamir played down the criticism.
   ``I understand the worry expressed by some in the United States
such as Dole,'' said Shamir. ``I can understand it, but I think the
majority of public opinion understands that our purpose was to free
hostages, to free people who are in the hands of terrorists.''
   Despite mounting pressure, however, Israeli officials said the
government was unlikely to free Obeid unless the pro-Iranian Shiite
groups agree to Israel's offer of a prisoner exchange.
   ``We have made a proposal,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister
Bejamin Netanyanu said on Israel TV's midnight news. ``They can
answer it, but they must understand that we will not give in to the
dictates of their blackmail.''
   An official close to Shamir added that unless there was a swap:
``I don't believe that we will release Obeid.''
   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed there
were internal divisions over the abduction of Obeid and the
subsequent handling of the evolving crisis.
   ``Maybe we underestimated the extent of the media coverage of
this crisis,'' said one Israeli official.
   Others criticized government planners for failing to appreciate
the sensitivity to Moslems of kidnapping a Shiite clergyman.
   One member of the Cabinet, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the
left-leaning Labor Party, disclosed that he had voted against the
abduction at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in which the operation was
approved by a 11-1 vote.
   A Shahal aide who demanded anonymity said the minister believed
the reaction of Hezbollah was too unpredictable to make such an
operation worthwhile.
   The official confirmed a report in the daily Al Hamishmar that
there was also division in the army.
   Israeli media said the Cabinet failed to consider the
possibility that Hezbollah would retaliate against Western hostages
instead of Israeli POWs.
   ``It is now clear that in the Cabinet meeting in which the
kidnapping was approved, a script was not presented to the
ministers which took into account the execution of the foreign
hostages in Lebanon,'' Israel radio said.

   Health educators have begun distributing
condoms to county jail inmates, despite questions about the
legality of the program.
   Although the program initiated Monday is part of the county's
4-year-old AIDS prevention project, prosecutors remain uncertain
whether participants could face charges of encouraging sex between
prisoners, a felony in California.
   Advocates argue the plan is targeted at preventing acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, not encouraging sex.
   Inmates must request condoms one at a time from health
educators, who will authorize distribution if deemed medically
appropriate, according to San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessey. He
has instructed jail deputies not to charge inmates with possession
of contraband for having a condom.
   ``We're not naive; we know it goes on here as well as every
other jail despite our efforts to prevent it,'' he said. ``But at
least now it will be safe sex.''
   According to an opinion by the district attorney's office,
public health workers who hand out the condoms could be found
criminally liable, but prosecutors will investigate only if a
complaint is made.

   Gwendolyn S. King took office Tuesday as
Social Security commissioner, promising to provide ``more efficient
and humane'' service for beneficiaries and to safeguard trust fund
reserves.
   Mrs. King, 48, took the oath of office at Social Security
Administration headquarters near Baltimore with a pledge that the
agency will ``serve only ... the public interest.''
   ``My goal is a fairer, more efficient and humane Social Security
system,'' she said.
   Mrs. King, a former congressional, state and federal aide, said
she would defend Social Security reserves against those who would
tap them for other purposes.
   She said: ``It is imperative that the trust fund reserves be
safeguarded to ensure a sound Social Security program for both
current and future generations of beneficiaries.''
   She also promised agency employees she would provide
``leadership that stands up for you, especially when you think you
may be left standing alone.''
   During the Reagan administration, the agency pared its work
force by about 20 percent to 65,000 employees as part of a plan to
streamline and modernize operations. Critics, however, complain
that the remaining employees are overworked, morale is low and the
quality of service has declined.
   ``SSA deserves leadership which respects and trusts its
employees; leadership that will lead, but will also listen,'' Mrs.
King said.
   She was sworn in by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan, who said the nation's retirement and disability benefits
system rests in ``capable, caring hands.'' His department has
jurisdiction over the Social Security Administration.
   The agency administers both the Social Security old age,
survivors and disability benefits program and the Supplemental
Security Income program for needy people who are aged, blind or
disabled.
   More than 38 million Americans collect monthly Social Security
checks totaling about $230 billion each year and another 4.1
million receive monthly SSI benefits totaling more than $14 billion
a year.
   Mrs. King succeeds Dorcas Hardy, who announced in June that she
would resign effective Monday. Most recently, Mrs. King worked as
executive vice president of the Washington government relations
firm of Gogol &amp; Associates.

<HEAD>With Lebanon-Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for federal
prosecutors said today the captors of two West Germans kidnapped in
Lebanon have demanded the release of convicted hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi and his brother, Abbas.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Karlsruhe, said the kidnappers have also demanded
telephone contact with the two Hamadi brothers and that they be
placed in the same prison.
   Foerster told The Associated Press that the demands were relayed
to the West German Embassy in Beirut, but he did not indicate when
or how.
   Rainer Mueller, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Bonn,
refused to comment on Foerster's remarks.
   Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Struebig were kidnapped near Sidon,
Lebanon, on May 16. Both are employees of the West German relief
organization Asme-Humanitas.
   No one has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the 28-year-old
Kemptner and Struebig, 48. Asme-Humanitas officials said today they
had not been informed of any demands.
   Foerster said ``the kidnappers, who have not previously linked
the hostage-taking with demands, now through the West German
Embassy in Beirut have set as their conditions ... the release of
... Abbas Ali Hamadi and Mohammed Ali Hamadi.''
   There have been previous reports that the kidnappings were
linked to the Hamadi case.
   A day after the two relief workers disappeared, Mohammed Hamadi
was sentenced to life in prison on murder and air piracy charges by
a court in Frankfurt for the 1985 TWA hijacking in which a U.S.
Navy diver was killed.
   His brother, Abbas Hamadi, is serving a 13-year prison term for
an April 1988 conviction on charges he helped kidnap two West
German businessmen in a 1987 attempt to force the release of his
brother.
   The two businessmen were subsequently released.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley cautioned today
against permitting the Middle East hostage crisis to strain U.S.
relations with Israel, saying ``no greater goal could be sought by
some of the terrorists.''
   Foley's comment came as Israel's kidnapping of a radical Moslem
cleric drew direct fire from Congress and indirect criticism from
President Bush after the apparent execution of American hostage Lt.
Col. William Higgins in retaliation.
   The White House told congressional leaders at a briefing late
Monday that the United States was kept in the dark about Israel's
plans to kidnap Abdul Karim Obeid on Friday from his home south of
Beirut.
   ``There was no consultation between Israel and the United
States,'' said one lawmaker who attended the White House briefing,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``That was mentioned two or
three times.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas pressed ahead today
with his criticism of the Israeli government for its ``unilateral''
decision to kidnap Obeid.
   ``Today I am not happy that one of our closest and most
important allies, Israel, has also struck out alone, free-lancing,
apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to win the release
of some of its citizens held hostage,'' Dole said in a speech on
the Senate floor.
   But he added that he did not blame Israel for directly causing
Higgins' apparent death, saying instead that ``his blood is on the
hands of the assassins.''
   ``It was an action taken with an inappropriate bravado and
public show which tended to exacerbate the situation,'' Rep. Romano
Mazzoli, D-Ky., said of the Israeli seizure of Obeid.
   ``In the future ... I hope the Israelis act with the same
restraint and concern for all likely consequences, including the
effect upon the lives of all hostages, which is being exhibited
today by President Bush,'' Mazzoli added.
   In his daily news conference, Foley said Higgins had been killed
by terrorists and added, ``The United States and Israel have both
been victimized by terrorist acts.''
   ``No greater goal could be sought by some of the terrorists than
to drive a wedge between the United States and Israel,'' he said.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, speaking on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' program, said risks are inherent in battling
terrorism, and ``the United States knows that well.''
   ``I understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in the
United States... But I think that it is important that we reserve
our anger against those who are responsible for this situation,
against the terrorists of the Hezbollah movement.''
   The Senate voted 99-0 late Monday to condemn the apparent
Higgins killing in a resolution that also took a swipe at Israel.
   The resolution called on Bush to urgently consult Israel and
other governments ``concerning their policies and actions which
might have relevance to the interests of the United States or
increase the vulnerability of U.S. citizens to attacks by
terrorists.''
   Dole said the resolution was a signal to terrorists and their
sponsors in nations like Iran, but also was meant ``to send a
message to our friends.''
   The message: ``This is a very serious matter and we believe that
in any future efforts there should be some notification, some
coordination, and maybe more responsibility assumed by our
friends,'' he said.
   Earlier, Dole sounded bitter as he noted on the Senate floor
that Israel had to know before it undertook the kidnapping of Obeid
that the action would place American hostages in further jeopardy.
   Participants in the White House meeting said Dole made the same
points directly to Bush, and also noted that he had been criticized
by some lawmakers for his comments.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on ``CBS This
Morning'' that the Israeli action ``was not helpful, and it's not a
focused response.'' Higgins was a onetime military aide to
Weinberger.
   ``I think that was a most unfortunate statement at that
particular time,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said on the CBS
program of Dole's remarks. ``And I think that our alliance with
Israel is very important at this point.''
   ``To suggest that ... the execution of Colonel Higgins should
fall in the lap of the Israelis is a complete overstatement and
frankly plays into the hands of the terrorist organizations who
would like to create deeper divisions ...between our own nation and
that of Israel,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on the same
program.
   Bush, in a statement Monday night, said, ``On Friday, I said
that the taking of any hostage was not helpful to the Middle East
peace process. The brutal and tragic events of today have
underscored the validity of that statement.''
   Israel supporters in Congress quickly defended the kidnapping.
``Their operation is a logical act in the context of the chaos in
which it was carried out,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
   Dole's criticism was ``a contemptible slander, and it shows more
than anything the gullibility of its utterer,'' he said. ``It is
precisely what the murderers want people to think. But ... there is
only one party responsible for the murder of Colonel Higgins, and
that is his Shiite Moslem captors.''
   Others in Congress issued calls for U.S. revenge and one, Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., circulated a letter calling on colleagues to
support an effort to extradite Obeid to stand trial for terrorism
in the United States.
   But others cautioned against moves that would worsen the
situation.
   ``Like all Americans, I want to see strong and forceful action
against the people who may have killed Col. Higgins,'' said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``But our actions must not
be motivated by mere revenge. They must be designed to identify and
bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act.''
   House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
urged that the matter be brought before the United Nations Security
Council. Higgins was working as a member of the U.N. peacekeeping
force in Lebanon when he was abducted more than a year ago.

   A foundation has purchased the childhood
home of author Flannery O'Connor and hopes to convert it into a
museum dedicated to her memory.
   Miss O'Connor is considered one of the 20th century's leading
fiction writers. Her works include two novels, ``Wise Blood'' and
``The Violent Bear It Away,'' as well as collections of short
stories and essays.
   The Flannery O'Connor Home Foundation Inc. gave the previous
owner of the three-story house, Mary Runyon, a check for $132,000
on Monday.
   Miss O'Connor, who died Aug. 3, 1964, lived in the house from
1925 until 1938. Mrs. Runyon bought it from the author's mother,
Regina Cline O'Connor.
   Foundation treasurer Hugh Brown, a professor at Armstrong State
College, said the group hopes to have the museum open by spring
1990.

<HEAD>Christians and Syrians Battle in Beirut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners battled
across Beirut with howitzers and rockets, and police said one
person was killed and four were wounded.
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun today declared a
``popular liberation revolt'' against Syrian troops in Lebanon
after an Arab League mediation committee said Syria had blocked its
efforts to end the 14-year-old civil war.
   ``The era of the popular liberation revolt will not be far ...
It will be a sweeping river of resistance in every city, village,
street and house,'' Aoun said.
   The Maronite Catholic general's 20,000 predominantly Christian
forces have been locked in fierce shelling duels with Syria's
40,000 troops in Lebanon since March 8.
   The casualties in the overnight fighting raised the overall toll
to 511 killed and 2,162 wounded in the 20-week confrontation across
the ravaged capital and surrounding mountains.
   Syrian troops have been deployed in predominantly Moslem areas
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab League.
   Aoun contends the Syrians have betrayed their mandate by siding
with the Moslems in the civil war and should leave.
   The current round of violence broke out after Aoun blockaded
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of Beirut
for denying the ailing state treasury about $100 million annually
in lost customs dues.
   In another development, Israeli-backed militiamen today killed
three heavily armed Palestinian guerrillas as they tried to
infiltrate across the Lebanese border, a security source in
Jerusalem said.
   The militiamen of the South Lebanon Army killed the gunmen near
the village of Houle, about a mile northwest of the Israeli border
in Israel's self-declared security zone, the security source said.
He said no militiamen were injured in the shootout.
   The source said the gunmen carried identification cards from the
Syrian-backed Palestine Liberation Front (PLF). He said the gunmen
were heavily armed and were likely on a mission to attack a
settlement in northern Israel.

<TEXT>
   The United States should put greater effort
into helping cool or avoid conflicts among developing nations, says
a congressional report that rates problems in Third World countries
as a greater threat to U.S. security than the Soviet military.
   ``The danger points can become turning points toward improving
life for all on this planet _ especially the poor and hungry _ if
we act now,'' Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, said Tuesday at a news
conference where he joined two other lawmakers in releasing the
report.
   It lists five major problems in developing nations _ economic
stagnation, environmental damage, the threat to democracy from the
military's political power, weapons proliferation and drug
trafficking.
   In one major recommendation, the report by Congress' Arms
Control and Foreign Policy Caucus calls for all nations to cut
their military budgets by 50 percent, providing money for urgent
civilian needs.
   The report also suggests that the United States press for
negotiated settlements to civil wars and urges a U.S. ban on
military aid to countries with dictatorships or to those ruled by
military forces that act independently of elected governments.
   The United States cannot concentrate alone on the ``outdated
East-West, Cold War mentality,'' according to the study.
   ``Today's security threats are problems like global warming and
international debt,'' said Rep. Matthew F. McHugh, D-N.Y., another
congressman involved with the report.
   ``They aren't American or Soviet problems alone, and they can't
be solved bilaterally _ they are transnational problems that
require transnational solutions.''
   Leland noted that wars have an economic as well as personal
cost, saying that last year ``the 23 wars in the developing world
not only killed hundreds of thousands of people and created
millions of refugees, they also reduced U.S. exports by billion of
dollars.''
   The report also recommended the appointment of a Cabinet-level
U.S. development representative _ similar to the U.S. trade
representative _ to concentrate on the problems of developing
nations. And it called for a summit between developed and
developing countries.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., a member of the caucus, said the
``five global epidemics may not explode as fast as nuclear weapons,
but their net effect could be just the same: Destruction of our
society as we know it.''
   The report said the five major Third World problems it focused
on ``are emerging as a potentially greater long-term threat to U.S.
security than Soviet military power.''
   McHugh, Hatfield and Leland commissioned the report, ``The
Developing World: Danger Point for U.S. Security.''
   A review of recent polls, according to the report, showed that
Americans are more concerned with developing nations and problems
such as drugs and trade than fears about East-West conflicts.

<HEAD>Housing Slump Helps Push Construction Spending Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A persistent housing slump helped push
construction spending in June to the lowest level in eight months,
the government said Tuesday, but economists are expecting at least
a modest rebound as interest rates decline.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction activity fell 0.8 percent in June to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.7 billion, the lowest level
since October. The decline followed a 0.6 percent gain in May and a
0.8 percent drop in April.
   Construction of new housing units dropped 1.2 percent to an
annual rate of $136.6 billion, the lowest level in three years. It
was the fifth consecutive monthly decline.
   A year-long campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to fight
inflation with higher interest rates ended this spring. Starting in
early June, the central bank reversed course and has eased
short-term rates three times, once in June and twice last month.
   Long-term rates, over which the Fed has less influence, are also
down. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.81 percent last
week, the lowest in two years, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Economists expect rates to continue falling gradually and, as a
result, construction activity to pick up. But, softness in economic
growth overall will prevent a strong surge, they said.
   ``I don't see a big rebound. ... At least in the housing sector,
I think we have several more slow months to come while people wait
to see whether we're going to have a recession or not,'' said
economist James Christian of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
   ``If you can't sell them, you shouldn't build them,'' he said.
   Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9
percent above the same period in 1988, an increase that doesn't
even make up for inflation in construction costs.
   The weakness in June included a 4.8 percent drop in public
construction, which accounts for about one-fifth of construction
activity, to an annual rate of $80.6 billion. The decline included
a 3.6 percent drop in spending for highways and streets, the
biggest government category.
   Spending on single-family homes fell 1.3 percent to an annual
rate of $113.6 billion, while multifamily construction was down 0.9
percent to $23 billion.
   Non-residential construction rose 2.8 percent to a rate of
$100.3 billion. That reflected strength in industrial projects, up
4.3 percent; hotels and motels, up 6.8 percent; office building, up
1.8 percent, and other commercial projects such as shopping
centers, up 2.5 percent.
   Economist John Savacool of the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said activity is cooling in office and retail
building, but still strong in factory construction, which is
supported by manufacturers' success in selling more goods overseas.
   ``The one thing that is restraining additional investment in the
industrial sector is that everyone is looking over their shoulder
to see if there's a recession coming,'' he said. ``The people in
charge of investment are trying to be very cautious because they
realize we're going to get a rude surprise sooner or later.''
   He predicted a small increase in construction activity in the
second half of this year, ``but not enough to get excited about.''

   The long-awaited Soviet publication of parts of

   Exiled author Alexander Solzhenitsyn had demanded that the book,
his documentary on the Soviet political prison camp system, be
published before any of his other works appear in the Soviet Union.
   Novy Mir will follow its precedent-setting move with parts of
Solzhenitsyn's novels ``The First Circle'' and ``Cancer Ward,'' the

   Two journals in Leningrad will publish ``March, 1917'' and
``August, 1914'' this year and next, Tass said. A book publisher is
planning a collection of Solzhenitsyn works as well.
   Meanwhile, a group of legislators plans to propose repealing the
1974 order that stripped Solzhenitsyn of his citizenship and
banished him from his homeland, Tass said. The author lives in
Vermont.

   The Department of Energy should slow its plans
for a proposed high-level nuclear waste dump in Nevada and make
studying the risk of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions a high
priority, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff said today.
   The NRC staff made public its comments on the department's site
characterization plan designed to determine whether the proposed
Yucca Mountain repository, located about 100 miles northwest of Las
Vegas, could safely store tons of radioactive nuclear waste for
10,000 years.
   ``NRC has a broad programmatic concern that the pressure to meet
unrealistic schedule milestones may leave DOE insufficient time to
plan and to execute proper technical information-gathering
activities,'' said Robert Bernero, chief of waste disposal for the
commission.
   In a letter to Sam Rousso, acting director of civilian
radioactive waste management for the energy department, Bernero
also expressed concern about geologic faults and volcanic cones in
the area.
   ``High priority should be given to conducting those
investigations which can lead to a determination of whether the
site is subject to an unacceptably high probability of disruption
as a result of volcanism, faulting, or seismicity,'' Bernero said.
   At a briefing at NRC headquarters in nearby Rockville, Md.,
Bernero said the volcanic cones in the area of Yucca Mountain have
been a cause of concern for NRC experts.
   ``You can't miss them,'' he said. ``If you stand on the
mountain, that's what you see.''
   Bernero also said in his letter that the department ``needs to
demonstrate the adequacy'' of its design for an experimental shaft
to be drilled on the proposed site, which he said would probably be
used for ventilation and other purposes.
   The department also needed to improve its program to assure
quality of performance by contractors, he said.
   The Nevada state government is strongly opposed to the waste
dump for safety and public health reasons. Gov. Bob Miller recently
signed a bill prohibiting storage of high-level radioactive waste
in Nevada.

<HEAD>Peace Conference Agrees to Send Team to Cambodia</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with ministerial meeting today ending

   An international peace conference on Cambodia today
agreed to dispatch an investigation team to that civil war-torn
country and set up a force to monitor a lasting peace there.
   ``This constitutes a great first step forward on the path which
should provide a return to peace for this country,'' said Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas of France.
   With Indonesia, France is co-chair of the monthlong conference
that began earlier this week. Parties at the meeting are seeking
formation of an interim government before Vietnam, which installed
Cambodia's communist regime, is scheduled to finish pulling its
troops out of the country by Sept. 27.
   A three-party resistance coalition headed by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk is fighting the government.
   Dumas said delegations from 19 nations and the United Nations
were stalled ``until the final moments'' of the ministerial
session, which ended at noon today. The foreign ministers are to
return to Paris to close the conference Aug. 28-30.
   The French foreign minister said the mission, under the aegis of
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, was to be
dispatched ``very quickly'' to Cambodia and other involved
countries, but he did not set a date.
   It is to gather technical information needed to set up an
international control mechanism to monitor a Vietnamese troop
pullout, an end to foreign interference, and a cease-fire among
warring parties.
   The three-party guerrilla alliance, which includes the communist
Khmer Rouge, have been fighting the government since shortly after
Vietnam invaded in 1978. The Khmer Rouge, who ruled Vietnam until
they were driven out by the Vietnamese, are the most powerful of
the guerrilla forces.
   The Cambodian government and the United States want to prevent
the Khmer Rouge from taking power in Cambodia after a Vietnamese
withdrawal. The Khmer Rouge are blamed for killing more than 1
million Cambodians in a nationwide purge during their 1975-1978
rule.
   Delegates to the Paris conference also agreed to set up four
working commissions on the monitoring unit, international
guarantees, refugees and reconstruction, and Cambodia's political
problems.
   ``I think I can say without exaggeration that this beginning
augurs well for the conference,'' said Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas, speaking at a joint news conference with Dumas.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan had raised objections to the
investigation mission and other aspects of today's agreements.
   However, China, the guerrilla group's main backer, intervened
privately Monday night with the leaders of the resistance
coalition, said a conference source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Also at the conference, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach said only 26,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia. He
challenged anyone to prove charges by Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge
that Hanoi was leaving behind tens of thousands of Vietnamese
soldiers disguised as Cambodians.
   Other estimates say there are 60,000 Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Cut in MX Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: TOP 15 grafs new with Senate vote on MX amendment, stealth bomber;
picks up 12th graf pvs, One Senate.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

   The Senate today endorsed President Bush's
plan for making MX nuclear missiles mobile, rejecting a proposal to
slash $502 million from the administration's $1.1 billion request
for the weapons program.
   On a 62-38 vote, the Senate turned aside an amendment that would
have trimmed the funds earmarked for placing the existing 50 MX
missiles on railroad cars _ a budget-cutting step the House took
last week.
   ``If we have that kind of unraveling over here, we go to
conference with a totally illogical, unsound program ... and I
believe that will be detrimental to both our national security and
our arms control,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, said as the Senate resumed consideration of its
version of the $295 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill.
   The Senate also approved, 93-7, a non-binding resolution
expressing the sense of the chamber that ``it is not presently
prudent or possible to commit to the procurement of an operational
force'' of B-2 stealth bombers.
   Lawmakers have criticized the plan to build 132 of the
radar-evading planes at a cost of $70 billion, or $530 million per
plane.
   The House last week voted to strictly limit the program in
fiscal 1990, pressing the Pentagon to come up with a cheaper
program. But the Senate kept the administration's program
relatively intact, making a modest cut of $300 million.
   Voting against the B-2 resolution today were Sens. Dan Coats,
R-Ind.; Bob Dole, R-Kan.; Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.;
James McClure, R-Idaho; Don Nickels, R-Okla., and Steve Symms,
R-Idaho.
   In floor debate on the MX amendment, Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.,
argued against the cut, saying it would ``blow apart the carefully
crafted compromise'' reached by the White House and congressional
leaders on money for the MX and mobile Midgetman missiles.
   Following the verbal pact, Bush proposed spending $1.1 billion
to move multiple-warhead MX missiles from fixed silos to rail cars
and $100 million on the single-warhead Midgetman missile in the
year beginning Oct. 1.
   Last week, however, the House approved a $502 billion cut in the
MX program and elimination of all of the money earmarked for the
Midgetman.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., sponsor of the MX amendment, urged his
colleagues to do the same.
   ``We should not be writing a blank check on two mobile
systems,'' said Levin. He said spending on both missiles is
inconsistent with the United States' position to ban mobile
missiles in strategic arms reduction talks.
   The rejected amendment called for using the $502 million for the
F-14D Tomcat jet fighter, the Navy's carrier aircraft that Bush has
slated for elimination; the Army's Apache helicopter and cleanup of
nuclear waste sites.
   The Senate also planned to vote on burden-sharing measures
introduced by Nunn, who argued that the United States should limit
the number of U.S. troops in Europe and negotiate with Japan on
paying for its own defense.
   ``There can be no free lunches and no free rides,'' Nunn said
Monday in introducing the amendments.
   One Senate burden-sharing amendment would impose a ceiling on
the ratio of U.S. forces stationed in Europe compared to other NATO
forces in Europe. Nunn said U.S. forces comprise about 10 percent
of the total NATO troop strength in Europe and under his amendment,
any increase in the ratio could not exceed 1 percentage point.
   Nunn argued that the measure would strengthen the NATO position
in conventional arms reduction talks with the Warsaw Pact nations
and dissuade U.S. allies from unilateral reductions before an
agreement is reached.
   ``This would put an arrow in President Bush's quiver,'' Nunn
said, adding that the measure sends a message to U.S. allies: ``If
you cut unilaterally, we're not going to be left holding the bag.''
   The second amendment calls on Japan to increase its security and
foreign aid program and requires Bush to negotiate an agreement
``providing for complete offset by Japan of the costs of deploying
U.S. forces in defense of Japan.''
   Japan spends a little more than 1 percent of its gross national
product on defense, while the United States spends about 6 percent.
Japan contributes about $2 billion _ 40 percent of the total U.S.
cost _ for American troops stationed there, Nunn said.
   The third measure was a non-binding resolution urging the United
States and South Korea to discuss the possibility of some
reductions of U.S. forces from the Asian country. The provision
also asks Bush to prepare a five-year plan on U.S. military
presence in South Korea.
   On Monday, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment
expanding the liability of the B-2 manufacturer for
contractor-caused defects on the stealth bomber.
   Levin, sponsor of the measure, had complained that repairs of
costly defects would be paid by the Pentagon, not Northrop Corp.,
and increase the price of the plane, which at $530 million a copy
is the most expensive in history.
   The House, meanwhile, voted 382-29 to approve a bill providing
$8.7 billion for military construction projects and for maintenance
and construction of housing for service personnel.
   The bill passed without controversy after a group of lawmakers
backed away from their plan to exempt some military bases scheduled
to be closed under the government's overall base consolidation plan.
   Although $262.7 million below the level approved for the current
fiscal year, the bill contains $500 million toward implementing the
recommendations of the base closing commission in the year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The closings, which promise long-term savings, are expected to
cost more than $4 billion over the next few years.

<HEAD>Dubcek Urges Change of Course, or Communism Will Fail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the leader of
the failed 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms, has told
Czechoslovakia's leaders they should change course or risk losing
power, according to a letter made public Tuesday.
   ``Society is trembling in the clutches of hopelessness,'' Dubcek
wrote to the Communist Party's Politburo and policy-setting Central
Committee.
   ``Do not leave the removal of deformations of the past to either
justified pressure or chance,'' he added, urging Prague's
entrenched Communist leaders to talk to opposition groups and to
reinstate 500,000 party members expelled after the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion that crushed his reforms.
   The June 23 letter, released through Czechoslovak activists to
Western radio stations and the London-based emigre publishers
Palach Press, was the first from Dubcek to Czechoslovakia's leaders
to be made public abroad.
   In the nine-page letter, Dubcek defended his ``Action Program,''
a blueprint for reform adopted when he was Communist Party leader
in April 1968.
   Noting the similarity between his program and recent Soviet
reforms, Dubcek also warned Prague's leaders against attacking
change in Poland and Hungary.
   ``They did not show concern when the universities in Poland were
being closed, lecturers expelled and workers shot,'' Dubcek wrote,
alluding to the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981.
   In a telephone conversation with The Associated Press from his
home in Bratislava, Dubcek confirmed writing the letter but
declined all comment on its contents.
   Activists in Prague said the letter apparently was made public
because Dubcek did not get a reply from the communist leaders.
   Dubcek, 67, was replaced as party leader in April 1969 by
current President Gustav Husak and expelled from the Communist
Party in June 1970.
   He has spoken out increasingly on Czechoslovak affairs since a
permanent police guard was lifted when Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited
Czechoslovakia in 1987. But the Soviet Union and fellow communist
reformers Hungary and Poland have yet to state officially that the
invasion crushing Dubcek's policies was a mistake.
   Human rights activists and reform communists are campaigning
increasingly actively for a revision of the 1968 invasion, which
they believe would encourage reformers in the party to adopt
genuine changes.
   The Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion is expected to be a
focus of renewed anti-government protests in Czechoslovakia.
   Politburo member and Prague party boss Miroslav Stepan warned in
a speech Tuesday to police, security forces and communists that
authorities would not tolerate disruptions in August.
   He declined to specify what measures would be taken. Prague is
rife with rumors of a tough police crackdown to quell any street
demonstrations following protests in August and October 1988, and
in January and May of this year.
   Echoing articles in the state-run media, Stepan condemned a
current petition being circulated that demands democratic reforms.
More than 11,500 people have signed the petition, according to
human rights activists in Prague.
   Stepan branded it ``an anti-perestroika and therefore
counterrevolutionary program, aimed against socialist society,
against the party and against hard-won benefits.''
   ``These are appeals encouraging disorders and destabilization,''
he added. ``All we can do is respond strongly, using political and
administrative means and, if necessary, power.''

<DATELINE>HIGH ISLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chantal, the Atlantic season's first
hurricane, lashed the Gulf Coast today with heavy rain and wind up
to 80 mph, forcing thousands to flee inland and frustrating the
search for 10 men from a capsized oil rig.
   Ten people were plucked by Coast Guard helicopter from two
sinking shrimp boats in the Gulf of Mexico, and a pump was flown
through the storm to a fishing boat taking on water 50 miles off
Galveston, the Coast Guard said.
   On Monday, one man was lost from an oil rig off Grand Isle, La.,
as the storm moved in.
   Chantal ripped off roofs, toppled power lines and sent barrels
rolling down streets after moving ashore about 8:15 a.m. near High
Island, midway between Galveston and Port Arthur, with winds that
just barely qualified as a hurricane.
   The hurricane weakened inland and was downgraded to a tropical
storm at 10:45 a.m., when the top wind speed dropped to 75 mph. At
11 a.m., Chantal was centered 25 miles northeast of Houston, moving
northwest at about 12 mph.
   ``We had heavy rain with real hard wind. It's doing a lot of
wind damage,'' said Robert Isaacks, an emergency medical technician
on High Island.
   Tornadoes were likely in Louisiana and Texas, and at least one
possible twister was spotted, forecasters said.
   The Coast Guard rescued seven people from a sinking shrimp boat
near the Sabine Pass station, said station chief Kenneth Compton.
``It was amazing. Flying in 60-knot winds they hoisted five people
on one (helicopter),'' Compton said. ``Another helo searched the
area and they found the other two.''
   Three people were rescued from another shrimp boat in the Gulf,
the Coast Guard said.
   Ten oil workers were missing off Morgan City, La., after their
rig capsized while heading inland Monday to escape the storm.
Swells up to 25 feet forced the Coast Guard to call off the search
Monday afternoon. Four other workers from the rig were rescued.
   Coastal Louisiana and Texas received 5 inches or more of rain
Monday and could receive 10 to 15 inches in the next two days, the
National Weather Service said. Tides along the upper Texas coast
were at 10 feet above normal in places.
   At Galveston, 1,000 people were evacuated from an area of the
city unprotected by a seawall. But many coastal residents waited
out the storm.
   ``We get worse thunderstorms than this,'' said Betty Barrow, a
28-year resident who remained on High Island. ``People are always
casual about these things here. The old-timers don't worry about
these things; they just stay.''
   Chantal knocked out power on High Island shortly after 7 a.m.,
but the few businesses in town remained open, including a grocery
where Ms. Barrow was on duty. She said the storm has been good for
business as residents stock up on canned goods, bottled water and
batteries.
   Some residents who waited overnight expecting a later landfall
were chased by wind and rising water from their homes on Bolivar
Peninsula, which separates Galveston Bay from the Gulf. High Island
is a town just north of the peninsula.
   Dorothy Wells and her husband, Bubby, left about 5 a.m. and
traveled inland to Winnie, where they had breakfast and waited for
a room at a motel.
   ``We boarded up. My husband says we're not taking it down until
September,'' Mrs. Wells said of their home, about 400 feet off the
beach.
   As Chantal churned across the Gulf, Tropical Storm Dean swirled
to life over the Atlantic late Monday. Dean had top sustained winds
of 50 mph and was centered about 775 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles, moving west at about 17 mph.
   Port Arthur Mayor Malcolm Grant asked the 800 residents of
Sabine Pass to evacuate the coastal community just west of the
Louisiana line, citing the likelihood of high water closing the
only highway between the town and Port Arthur.
   Evacuation centers were set up in schools in Port Arthur and in
Beaumont.
   In Orange, just north of Port Arthur, government offices were
closed and emergency centers set up. Crews handed out sandbags in
low-lying areas.
   More than 600 offshore oil workers were brought inland.
   Forecasters said the risk of flooding was high because the
ground remained saturated from Tropical Storm Allison, which
brought heavy rain in late June.
   ``If they tell us to get out, we get out,'' said Lutie Dyson,
62, who with her husband and about 65 others took shelter in a
school in Lake Charles, La.
   They were among about 8,500 Cameron Parish residents who
evacuated low-lying areas by Monday night. And 2,500 residents left
Grand Isle, 70 miles south of New Orleans, for fear the only road
to the island community might flood.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.

   The U.N.'s top peacekeeping official has
left for Beirut to try to recover the body of U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins, the U.N. military observer killed by his captors.
   Marrack Goulding, the undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping, will ``ascertain to the extent possible the facts
surrounding the fate of Lt. Col. Higgins,'' said U.N. spokeswoman
Nadia Younes.
   Pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists said they killed Higgins on
Monday because Israel did not release a Shiite cleric it abducted
last week in southern Lebanon.
   A group known as the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth
released a videotape that showed what it said was Higgins' body
dangling from a gallows.
   ``I was very sad when I saw the tape; it looks so much like him
that now I have little doubt that unfortunately he has been
killed,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I think that the American government, as well, thinks that he
has been killed,'' he said.
   On Monday, Perez de Cuellar said President Bush asked him to
help with the return of Higgins' body. No body has been found yet.
   Goulding, who is expected to arrive in Lebanon on Wednesday,
will begin his investigation at the headquarters of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon.
   Higgins was heading the 75-member U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization in Lebanon when he was abducted near Tyre on Feb. 17,
1988. His abductors claimed he was a spy for the CIA.

   Young black men were killed at a higher rate in
St. Louis than any major city in the country in recent years,
according to a study.
   ``One of every 13 black males in St. Louis who is 15 years old
will be murdered by the time he is 45, if these rates continue,''
the Missouri Department of Health said in the report released
Monday.
   In 1986, 169 blacks were killed, and black victims outnumbered
whites by nearly 7-to-1. The city of 1 million people is roughly
half black and half white.
   More than 83 percent of the black males killed were 15 to 40,
the study said. Two-thirds of the victims were shot, one-third were
drunk, and one-third were under the influence of drugs.
   The total number of slayings in St. Louis declined slightly from
1986 to last year. So far this year, 93 killings have occurred, and
78 of the victims were black, police said.
   The study, which included examinations of death certificates,
covered 1985-87.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Removes Cruise Missiles from Greenham Common</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENHAM COMMON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Air Force on Tuesday
began removing U.S. cruise missiles from Greenham Common, the first
NATO base to receive the intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
1983.
   A U.S. Air Force transport plane flew out the first of the 96
missiles at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, which are to
be destroyed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, the Air
Force said.
   Britain's domestic news agency Press Association said 16
missiles were flown out. The Air Force declined to give specifics.
   All the missiles are due to be removed by 1991 under the terms
of a superpower arms control treaty signed in 1987 to eliminate the
2,700 Soviet and U.S. land-based intermediate-range nuclear
missiles from Europe.
   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said the 16 missiles'
nuclear warheads were flown to the United States on July 19 and
could be recycled for use.
   The site became a focal point of demonstrations after the
deployment, and a permanent ``peace camp'' was set up by the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament supporters at one of its seven
entrances.
   Hundreds of thousands of anti-nuclear demonstrators protested
the deployment of the missiles in five European countries, starting
with an airlift to Greenham Common on Nov. 14, 1983.
   The other U.S. cruise missile base in Britain at Molesworth, 70
miles north of London, was deactivated in January after its 16
missiles were removed.

   A prairie rattlesnake appropriately named
Methusaleh has died.
   Methusaleh, named by students at Tabor College where it had
lived in a cage since it was captured in 1960, was found dead
Saturday. It was 31 or 32, believed to be a record for prarie
rattlesnakes in captivity, said Max Terman, a biology professor at
the college.
   The previous record-setter was a 19-year-old prairie rattler at
the San Diego Zoo, Terman said Tuesday.
   ``There really is no official record. The only thing you have
access to is records from zoos, laboratories and things like
that,'' Terman said. ``We refer to these records as noteworthy
longevity records.''
   Prairie rattlesnakes live in the wild 10 to 15 years, he said.
   Methusaleh is being preserved in a freezer until a taxidermist
can ``put him into a lifelike pose,'' Terman said. The snake will
then be kept on display at the college.
   Methusaleh was a biblical character who lived 969 years.

   The Energy Department today announced a
five-year plan to begin cleaning up the nation's atomic weapons
facilities, saying the first phase would cost $19.5 billion by 1995.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said the plan will be ``the
cornerstone'' of the government's long-term strategy for imposing
environmental safeguards and proper waste management at the
facilities. But he said the overall cleanup likely will take 30 or
more years.
   The department proposed spending about $2.4 billion in fiscal
1990, which begins in October, with costs exceeding $4 billion a
year by the mid-1990s.
   The plan also was designed to restore confidence in the
operation of weapons productions plants that have been marred by a
history of environmental and safety neglect.
   It includes a pledge by the Energy Department to develop a
system to comply with environmental and health laws. The department
also said it would implement a program whereby health records of
workers at weapons facilities would be released for scientific
analysis.
   ``The implementation of this plan will go a long way toward
gaining public acceptance of our ability to manage and operate (the
weapons) facilities safely,'' Watkins said in remarks to the
National Press Club.
   The five-year DOE plan includes money to correct shortcomings
and to bring the weapons facilities into compliance with federal
environmental laws. It also includes funds assuring that atomic
facilities that have been closed have adequate environmental
safeguards and do not pose a health hazard.
   Another large portion of the costs over the next five years deal
with developing improved waste management operations at operating
facilities.
   Watkins said that the department hopes to establish a timetable
that would conclude the cleanup at all department nuclear sites
within the next 30 years. The department previously has estimated
the cleanup costs for the 17 plants in a dozen states could exceed
$90 billion.
   ``Only through this difficult process will DOE, as an
institution, finally begin to assume its proper role as a protector
of the environment,'' Watkins said.
   A series of disclosures this year has revealed widespread
neglect of safety and environmental safeguards at the weapons
production plants, eroding public confidence in the program and
prompting some members of Congress to seek to take some oversight
authority away from the Energy Department.
   An internal department audit earlier this year also included a
blistering review of management failures at many of the plants and
said some department employees may face criminal charges for
violating environmental laws.
   The department's inspector general concluded that the $60
million ``environmental survey program,'' intended to provide
safeguards, was so flawed that it was useless.
   Reactors at the Savannah River plant in South Carolina were shut
down more than a year ago because of safety concerns.
   More recently, production operation at a uranium processing
plant in Fernald, Ohio, was halted after its manager said the plant
could not be brought into compliance with health and safety
regulations if its production program continued.
   Agents of the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency raided
the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado and the
Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio this summer.
   The federal government recently agreed to pay residents near the
Fernald plant $73 million to settle a suit over claims they have
been harmed by toxic releases.
   Meanwhile, the department announced Monday that it had reached
agreement with Westinghouse Electric Corp. in setting a schedule
for restarting production reactors at Savannah River, the country's
largest nuclear weapons plant.
   Department officials declined comment on a report in The New
York Times that Westinghouse, which operates the plant, had
estimated the cost of repairing and restarting the three reactors
at as much as $1.66 billion, or more than four times what had been
previously estimated.
   According to the Times, the higher cost estimates were provided
June 26 in a confidential report from Westinghouse to the
department. One department source said Watkins rejected the
proposal because of its high cost estimate and proposed restart
schedule.

   Rubber duckies are no fun, a Department
of Environmental Management official said Tuesday.
   The DEM outlawed plastic ducks in Rhode Island waterways after a
race in Warwick sent 7,000 toy ducks floating down the Pawtuxet
River.
   The Warwick Rotary Club, which sponsored the contest to call
attention to pollution in the river, charged spectators $3 to enter
a 3-inch pink or yellow plastic duck in a one-mile race.
   ``This is not a good idea for a lot of environmental reasons,''
Stephanie Powell, of the DEM's division of groundwater and
freshwater wetlands, said Tuesday.
   ``If you have thousands of pieces of plastic being dumped into a
river there's no way they're going to be picked up. A lot of these
plastics would end up on the riverbanks, in the marshes.''
   Powell also said the plastic ducks do not break down and could
endanger marine life.
   But Jack Frazier, Rotary Club president, said volunteers picked
up the ducks and all but four or five were accounted for.
   The DEM has not received any complaints, Powell said.
   The race raised $11,500 for the Rotary Club's environmental
fund, which goes to local environmental groups, Rotary officials
said.
   The real lucky duck was Tom Defelice of Warwick, who won a
vacation for four at Disney World in Florida after his duck crossed
the finish line first in 51:15.

   An auditor's report released Tuesday says the
government could save $21 million a year if it would just
acknowledge what any schoolchild knows _ that people turn a year
older on their birthdays.
   The birthday debate centers on the Social Security Act, which
follows Old English common law in judging that people reach a new
age on the day before their birthdays.
   Health and Human Services Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow
said that because the start and end of some benefits is determined
by ``age attainment,'' the old-fashioned definition skews who gets
what when.
   For example, people normally are eligible for full retirement
and Medicare benefits in the month that they turn 65, but benefits
start a month earlier for people born on the first of the month.
   An the other hand, benefits for children of disabled or deceased
workers normally run through the month in which they turn 18, but
end a month earlier for youth born on the first.
   Kusserow, in a report to the Social Security Administration and
Health Care Financing Administration, stated the obvious: ``The
popular understanding is that an individual attains a given age on
his or her birthday.''
   He recommended amending the law to ``define age attainment ...
as occurring on one's birthday,'' and said it would save $21.4
million a year in Medicare and Social Security payments.

   A federal grand jury was impaneled today to
investigate whether criminal activity occurred at the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant.
   U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver, who ordered the
investigation at the request of Acting Assistant Attorney General
John C. Keene, said that the 23-member panel would serve for 18
months and that the term could be extended another 18 months.
   Colorado has two grand juries that meet regularly to handle
federal cases, but Finesilver said the range of accusations against
the plant merited a special panel.
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver was raided June 6 by 75
FBI agents and investigators from the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons, is operated by Rockwell International under a contract
with the Department of Energy.
   The affidavit that led to the search warrant for the plant
contained more than 100 pages of allegations, including dumping of
hazardous wastes into streams that flow into water supplies for
four Denver suburbs and altering documents to cover up illegal
activities.
   Gov. Roy Romer and DOE officials have reached an agreement
allowing the Colorado Department of Health to monitor the plant
more closely.

   A popular fishing and swimming spot was

   ``The first time I tossed a minnow, he hit it so hard there was
nothing left but gills and head,'' said Tom Grob, who snagged the
fish Sunday. ``I threw another minnow in the same spot and he hit
it and put up a terrific fight.''
   Stewart Lake is stocked with trout by the state Department of

   It was temporarily closed to swimmers in case other piranha are
present, said Ken LePine, assistant director of the Dane County
Parks Department. LePine said the DNR is trying to determine the
source of the piranha, a carnivorous South American fish that
normally eats other fish.
   Grob said he gave the fish to a tropical pet store.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Bush's Nominees Sikes, Marshall, Barrett for
FCC</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee on Tuesday approved
President Bush's three nominees for the Federal Communications
Commission, clearing the way for expected speedy confirmation by
the full Senate.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted
15-2 to approve the nominations of:
   _Alfred C. Sikes, assistant secretary of Commerce for
communications and information. Bush has selected Sikes to become
chairman of the five-member commission.
   _Sherrie P. Marshall, a Washington attorney and former
legislative aide to outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.
   _Andrew C. Barrett, a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
   Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he
expected the full Senate to vote on the nominations before the
August congressional recess, which is scheduled to begin Friday.
They were expected to be confirmed easily.
   The only committee opposition to the nominees came from
Democrats Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Jay Rockefeller of West
Virginia.
   Gore said he was sending a ``symbolic signal'' to the White
House that he didn't believe the new FCC would be an improvement on
eight years of ``market-is-supreme'' deregulation during the Reagan
administration.
   ``I don't think what the FCC has been doing is in the public
interest,'' said Gore, who at a confirmation hearing Monday had
challenged the nominees on what they planned to do about indecent
programming.
   Gore, whose wife, Tipper, has led a grass-roots campaign against
violent and suggestive lyrics in rock music, on Tuesday reiterated
his displeasure with Barrett's assertion that, much like illegal
drugs are commonplace in society, a market also exists for indecent
radio and TV shows.
   Barrett said the FCC's role was to decide ``what the law will
allow us to tolerate.''
   ``There has been an attitude at the FCC that whatever the market
is, we are going to accept it,'' Gore said Tuesday. ``I hope they
will, if confirmed, not continue what they've been doing over at
the FCC.''
   The only outside opposition to the nominations has been from
anti-indecency groups who think the FCC hasn't been tough enough on
broadcast smut and that Bush didn't seek out nominees who were more
likely to take a hard line against indecency.
   Hollings, Gore and others hit hard on TV indecency, noting that
until Congress stepped in to ban all indecent TV programs in 1988,
the FCC had established a ``safe harbor'' for such shows from
midnight to 6 a.m. when children were presumed not to be watching.
   Sikes, a former Missouri broadcaster and self-described
moderate, said he would vigorously attack obscene material on the
airwaves, but that the Supreme Court has proscribed much of
Congress' power in the area of free speech and indecency.
   The FCC last year tried to implement the 24-hour ban on indecent
programming, but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged it
on constitutional grounds. A federal appeals court in January
stayed imposition of the law.
   Hollings and other committee members expressed hope that
relations between the FCC and Congress would improve after lengthy
battles with a commission headed by Patrick and his predecessor,
Mark S. Fowler.
   Major issues the new commission will face include the government
role in fostering international competitiveness in areas such as
high-definition television; further deregulation of the telephone
industry; re-regulating cable television; and assignment of the
airwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephones and
direct broadcast satellites.

   Retired Gen. George A. Vaughn, a decorated World
War I flying ace who shot down 13 enemy planes and one balloon, has
died. He was 92.
   Vaughn, of Staten Island, died Monday at New York
Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center in Manhattan.
   He received the British Distinguished Flying Cross, the U.S.
Distinguished Flying Cross, the Silver Star and two citations in
recognition of his combat record.
   Vaughn left Princeton University to join the Aviation Section of
the Army Signal Corps. He was sent to England where he trained with
the Royal Air Force.
   In 1918, with only 90 hours of in-flight training, he
encountered a German fighter pilot on his first day of action and
shot it down.
   Vaughn was shot down twice during the war but escaped uninjured.
   On graduating from Princeton in 1920, Vaughn joined Western
Electric Co. as a research engineer. He became a sales engineer and
aviation representative for Westinghouse in 1922. In 1928, he
organized Eastern Aeronautical Corp. and became its president.
   He is survived by his wife, Marion; two sons and a daughter; 11
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
   A memorial service is scheduled Friday on Staten Island.

   A man and his younger sister and brother
accidentally drowned in a pond of rainwater that accumulated in an
arroyo, authorities said.
   Larryington Miller, 26; Thelma Ann Miller, 23; and Toby Miller,
15, drowned Monday about 1{ miles northeast of Pinedale in rural
western New Mexico, said Alex Ashley, a deputy state medical
investigator.
   The brothers apparently found the pond that formed at the bottom
of a drop in the arroyo where water had carved a depression in the
sandstone and mud, Ashley said Tuesday.
   Ms. Miller found Toby floating in the water, so she sent her
newphews home to get help, Ashley said. Relatives arrived to find
her body floating, Ashley said.
   Navajo police and other officials were told by the family that
Larryington's clothes were on the side of the pond but they could
not find him, Ashley said. Fire and rescue personnel found
Larryington's body underwater, Ashley said.
   ``I think maybe the younger one jumped in and started drowning,
so the older brother jumped in to help,'' Ashley said. ``Then the
girl jumped in to try to help the other two.''
   Runoff from summer rain probably is creating ponds that can be
dangerous throughout rural New Mexico, he said.

   Iran has been trying to distance itself
from the threats by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon to murder Western
hostages.
   At the same time, however, it has vowed retaliation for the
abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric by Israeli commandos.
   Iran's leaders did not react immediately to the killing of Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped in 1988 while serving as
part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon. A
pro-Iranian Islamic group said it hanged Higgins on Monday because
Israel had failed to release Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who was
abducted Friday.
   Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before Higgins'
killing was announced that ``the threat against Higgins has nothing
to do with us. However, we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death
threat.''
   On Sunday, however, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi said
in Tehran that Islamic groups around the world would retaliate for
Israel's abduction of Obeid and two companions.
   ``The Islamic clergy ... and militant groups throughout the
world will take action against the interests of Israel and the
United States ... they will not allow them to live comfortably,''
Mohtashemi said.
   Denouncing the media coverage of Higgins' killing, the Abrar
daily newspaper said: ``The trumpets of human rights were not blown
at all when the Zionist thieves trespassed Lebanese territory and
shamelessly kidnapped a human being.''
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted
the newspaper as saying Higgins' death ``was no more depressing
than the daily killings by Israeli soldiers of Palestinians in the
occupied territories.''
   ``With the death of an American colonel, the banner of human
rights is once again being raised ... just because a blue-eyed
American has died.''
   Israel said Obeid had been involved in planning attacks on
Israel and offered to trade him for three Israeli soldiers held in
southern Lebanon, as well as the Western hostages.
   All the groups holding hostages in Lebanon are believed linked
to the Iranian-supported Hezbollah, or Party of God, but Hezbollah
denies it has anything to do with hostage-taking.
   Iranian media, which condone the actions of the Lebanese Shiite
groups, carried reports of Higgins' killing from Western news
agencies.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's president-elect, is believed to want
to erase Iran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.
   The 1979 fundamentalist revolution of Ayatollah Ruholla
Khomeini, who died June 3, helped spawn various Shiite terrorist
groups in Lebanon. Revolutionary Guards, sent into Lebanon during
the 1982 Israeli invasion, helped organize Hezbollah.
   Rafsanjani himself was criticized by the West this year when he
called for the death of five Americans or Europeans for every
Palestinian killed in the occupied territories by Israeli soldiers.
   Before Higgins' abduction, Rafsanjani was quoted by an Iranian
newspaper as saying that ``oppressed groups'' had no choice but to
take hostages.

   Six gunmen dragged a government radio
newscaster out of his house and killed him, military officials said
today, and the government postponed the re-opening of 10,000
schools because of continuing violence.
   A government communique blamed the slaying Monday night on
``subversives,'' the term it uses for Sinhalese radicals.
   The slaying came eight days after the assassination of the
chairman of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corp., who also was the
chief government censor. The government also blamed that killing on
Sinhalese extremists and placed radio and television stations under
military control to halt further violence.
   The Sinhalese extremists, angered by peace overtures made to the
Tamil minority and by the continuing presence of Indian
peacekeeping troops, have been revolting for two years against the
Sinhalese-dominated government and its supporters.
   Premakeerthi De Alwis, the latest victim, was a Sinhalese
newscaster on state radio and host of a children's television
program. De Alwis, 42, was shot to death in front of his home in
Homagama, 13 miles southeast of Colombo, the military officials
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Their report described the assailants as ``six unknown armed
persons.'' They did not speculate on a motive.
   Officials said Sinhalese extremists killed eight other civilians
and a soldier in a series of attacks in central and southern Sri
Lanka today and Monday night. In addition, security forces found
the bodies of five people and blamed Sinhalese extremists for the
deaths.
   More than 150 people described as ``suspected subversives'' were
detained by security forces for questioning, the government
communique said.
   The government also announced that today's scheduled re-opening
of schools had been postponed indefinitely ``because of the
security situation.''
   The 10,000 government-run schools, which have an enrollment of 4
million, were closed July 6 during worsening violence and a
transportation strike.
   The government has accused the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese ultranationalist group, of about 4,000 killings since
July 29, 1987, when then-President Junius R. Jayewardene and Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India signed a peace accord designed to
give Tamils in northeastern Sri Lanka some autonomy.
   Indian peacekeeping troops arrived to supervise the accord's
implementation and a surrender of arms by Tamil rebels. But the
largest Tamil guerrilla group reneged and turned its guns on the
Indians.
   Jayewardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, took office in
January after pledging to bring about the withdrawal of Indian
troops.
   Indian and Sri Lankan delegations have been meeting in New Delhi
since Saturday to work out a timetable for the withdrawal of the
estimated 45,000 Indian soldiers.
   About 600 Indian soldiers left Saturday night, but so far no
further withdrawals have been announced.
   In New Delhi, a Foreign Ministry official said talks between the
two countries' delegations were continuing. The official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, gave no further details.
   The Sri lankan delegation was to return to Colombo later today.
   About 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection since it
began in 1983.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
say they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the
Sinhalese.
   Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent of the population, control
the government and the military.

   A night of torrential rain in the Tokyo area
touched off floods and landslides that killed five people,
including three rescuers, and left six others missing, police said
today.
   Seventeen people were also injured, said an official of the
National Police Agency, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said
the rains flooded 6,202 houses, caused 99 landslides, and blocked
24 roads.
   In Kawasaki, just southwest of Tokyo, 14 firefighters were
buried by a landslide while trying to rescue a family of three
trapped in their two-story house by an earlier landslide.
   The police official said three firefighters were found dead, and
the other 11 were injured.
   Other rescuers were later forced to suspend their search for the
family because of the danger of another landslide, the official
said.
   In Chiba, 20 miles southeast of Tokyo, a landslide swept a
station wagon with a family of five into a reservoir, the official
said. He said three children were rescued, but the parents were
killed.
   Local meteorologists today said nearly 10 inches of rain fell on
Tokyo and neighboring areas in the previous 24 hours.

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is an often-repeated tale in
Addis Ababa: Two white children were kidnapped or abandoned 20
years ago, when the boy was about 5 years old and the girl but an
infant, and raised in a tribal family.
   The years have provided different variations on the story, and
though many here know some version, there are no records to
substantiate it.
   Now, however, a brother and sister have stepped forward,
claiming to be those lost children. They say they want to find
their parents.
   On June 23, a cable arrived at the State Department in
Washington from the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia's capitol. It began:
   ``On June 14, two Oromigna-speaking Caucasians visited (consular
officer) Conoff claiming to be the long-rumored kidnapped Americans
of 20 years ago.''
   ``After I sent the cable, I called Washington to assure them I
wasn't making this up on a slow day in Addis,'' said Carol L. Rose,
who retired this week as the U.S. consul in Ethiopia. ``I was
afraid the desk officer wouldn't believe it. It's all just too
fantastic.''
   Mrs. Rose's 2{-page cable told the story of Haile Mariam Gadessa
and Tegest Gadessa as they recounted it through an embassy
interpreter and later repeated it to The Associated Press.
   Haile Mariam, now 24 or 25, and Miss Tegest, about 20, speak
haltingly and nervously about their story in the presence of what
to them are strange, white foreigners.
   What little they know was told them by the native couple who
raised them. Haile Mariam has only the vaguest memory of those
days, Miss Tegest none at all.
   They tell of being left by their parents in the care of a
housekeeper, a man of the Oromo tribe who took them to live with
his relatives in a house of mud with a thatched roof.
   Haile Mariam said he was was raised as a herdsboy, keeping the
family's cattle, sheep and goats, while Miss Tegest was given to
another family as a maid.
   His eyes downcast and haunted, Haile Mariam tells of frequent
beatings by a foster father who never wanted them, of being taunted
and abused by villagers who saw him and his sister as freaks.
   His gnarled hands speak of a lifetime of hard work. He has never
spent a day in a classroom. His sister has completed eight years of
school.
   They said they are not sure why they were left with the
housekeeper, but Haile Mariam thinks their father became ill and
was flown out of Ethiopia for treatment, accompanied by their
mother.
   They said the housekeeper took them to live with his sister and
brother-in-law in Chabor-Gurage, a region about 50 miles west of
Addis Ababa. Whether or not that was meant to be temporary, it
became permanent after the housekeeper was bitten by a rabid dog
and died.
   ``After he died, they (the foster parents) were afraid they
would get in trouble (if they went to Ethiopian authorities), Haile
Mariam said.
   ``I've been hearing this legend almost from the day I arrived 22
months ago,'' said Mrs. Rose. ``All of the embassy's Ethiopian
employes know it.''
   So, too, do many other Ethiopians. Some speak of the children
being taken ``by a gang of Oromos.'' Others say the mother died of
a stroke shortly after they were abducted and ``the father has come
back many times looking for them.''
   ``The mystery is that we have no record of the parents asking
the embassy for help in finding the children, and neither does
anyone else,'' said Mrs. Rose.
   The consulate checked its own records back more than 20 years
and asked the State Department, the Defense Department, the
Canadian and all European embassies to do the same. All came up
blank.
   ``All we have is the legend,'' said Mrs. Rose. ``No records,
just the story.''
   But she has a theory.
   ``Back in the '60s, I was one of those backpacking around the
world on 50 cents a day,'' she said. ``If you got in trouble, the
last place you went was to the U.S. Embassy.''
   Mrs. Rose referred to a time when many Americans did not trust
their own government _ the days of assassinations, the Vietnam War
and turmoil in the streets.
   If the parents were civilians who chose not to seek help from
the U.S. Embassy, why didn't they go to local authorities for
assistance?
   The children disappeared in the last years of the long reign of
Emperor Haile Selassie, when the U.S. community in Ethiopia
numbered more than 20,000, many of them in the military.
   In 1974, Ethiopia was convulsed by a bloody revolution that
brought a Marxist government to power, and many records were lost
or destroyed.
   Mrs. Rose hired Abebe Worke, one of Ethiopia's most
distinguished lawyers and a former member of the country's High
Court, to investigate.
   She also notified the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry, which turned
the matter over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Neither Worke
nor the ministry has turned up any trace of the parents.
   A search of newspaper records by The Associated Press found no
mention of the disappearance.
   The absence of records suggests that the father was a military
man who had the children with an Ethiopian woman, then abandoned
her and them.
   ``Under those circumstances, in this society, the woman most
certainly would have tried to place the children with relatives,''
said Worke. ``The stigma of raising them alone would have been too
great.''
   While Mrs. Rose admits that scenario is possible, she doesn't
believe it. Her cable to the State Department said consular
officials were convinced the two ``are telling the truth as they
know it. ... Their skin is scarred from sunburn and the scarring
has caused some distortion of their facial features. They both have
light brown eyes and curly light brown-dark blond hair.''
   Their skin is not brown or black, but bronze. Adds Gustavo
Delgado, an embassy political officer: ``I think they are as white
as the porcelain on your kitchen sink.''
   With no record of their birth or nationality, there is little
that Mrs. Rose and the U.S. government can do for Haile Mariam and
Tegest.
   As the search continues for their parents, they live together in
a mud hut in the village of Sebeta, about 25 miles from Addis Ababa.
   There, Miss Tegest cares for her 3-year-old son, Astoy, born out
of wedlock, while Haile Mariam supports them with odd jobs, earning
about 15 Ethiopian birr a month, the equivalent of $8.
   And they recall the distant past.
   ``I have a memory, it is almost like a dream, very indistinct,''
Haile Mariam says. ``It is of my mother. She is very tall and
white. And we lived in a house made of bricks.''

<HEAD>Station Owner Convicted in Ordinance Fight Over Jesus Sign</HEAD>

   A service station owner is facing six
months probation for violating an ordinance with a portable sign
advertising 10 percent discounts to ``those whom Jesus loves.''
   Escambia County Judge James Roark told Jerry Harrison, 46, he
would lift the probation, imposed after a jury verdict Monday, if
he complies with the sign ordinance within 30 days. Roark also
ordered him to pay $430 in court costs.
   Harrison, who says he is a born-again Christian and reformed
drug and alcohol abuser, said he was doing ``God's will'' by
offering the discounts on labor, advertised on a 4-by-8-foot
portable sign.
   Officials said they objdcted to the medium rather than the
message.
   Harrison was charged with violating an ordinance against
portable signs, passed to reduce visual clutter and safety hazards.
   ``I thought the judge was very fair,'' said Harrison, who
claimed he gives the discount to all customers because Jesus loves
everyone. He said he wants to find a way to keep the sign, but will
remove it if he cannot meet requirements.
   Exxon officials were unable to force him to remove the sign in
1987 after members of the Jewish community complained about it, but
he changed the message. Initially, the sign stated the discount was
available only to Christians.

<HEAD>NRC Experts Tell Energy Agency It Should Delay Sinking Experimental
Shafts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technical experts of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission told the Energy Department on Tuesday it should delay
sinking two experimental shafts at a proposed high-level nuclear
waste dump in Nevada until further study of problems including
possible earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
   In comments on the department's site characterization plan for
the proposed Yucca Mountain repository, the NRC staff said the
department had erred by treating the shafts as though they were
merely test drilling and would not be part of the dump if it is
established.
   Robert Bernero, chief of waste disposal for the NRC, said the
shafts would be ``the first major holes to be dug into the Yucca
Mountain formation.''
   If the dump is established, he said, they would probably be used
either for ventilation or as an alternative form of access. The
main access route, through which radioactive waste would be brought
into the dump, would be a ramp.
   Congress has ordered the department to study whether the Yucca
Mountain location, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev.,
could safely store tons of radioactive nuclear waste for 10,000
years.
   Bernero said consideration of a possible license for the dump is
not expected until about 1995.
   The location is opposed on health and public safety grounds by
the state of Nevada, whose legislature has passed a law prohibiting
a high-level nuclear waste dump within its boundaries.
   In a briefing at the NRC's Rockville, Md., headquarters and in a
letter to Sam Rousso, acting director of civilian radioactive waste
management for the Energy Department, Bernero said study of seismic
and volcanic risks needed to be given high priority.
   ``If you stand on Yucca Mountain and look to the west across
Crater Flats, you can see a number of volcano cones 10 or 12 miles
away,'' he told reporters. ``They raise questions, obviously ...
that another volcano might go off, and it does go off, that it
might go off in or through the repository.''
   Bernero also said there is ``a body of data that suggests the
presence of a fault that would go right through where the shafts
are.''
   ``In our analysis, it is doubtful,'' he said. ``It's not
certainly there, or it's not certainly not there. It should be part
of the design process to determine whether there is faulting and,
if so, its significance.''
   Bernero said the latest plan submitted by the department, on
Dec. 28, contained ``substantial improvements'' over the original
one of Jan. 8, 1988.
   ``However, we do have a range of technical concerns.''
   ``We have asked DOE to give much greater care to the design
control process and the analysis for these experimental shafts,''
he said.
   He said NRC and department officials met July 6 and 7 and agreed
to work together this summer and fall ``so the issues can be
resolved before the shafts are sunk.''
   He said agreements were also reached to improve quality
assurance plans for auditing the performance of contractors.
   In his letter to Rousso, Bernero said, ``NRC has a broad
programmatic concern that the pressure to meet unrealistic schedule
milestones may leave DOE insufficient time to plan and to execute
proper technical information-gathering activities.''
   ``High priority should be given to conducting those
investigations which can lead to a determination of whether the
site is subject to an unacceptably high probability of disruption
as a result of volcanism, faulting, or seismicity,'' Bernero said.

   When Maurice Douglass isn't playing
football in the Chicago Bears' defensive backfield, he is,
according to the team's press guide, an ecdysiast.
   Most people would say he's a stripper.
   Whatever his off-season activity is called, the 25-year-old
athlete says performing in a G-string is not really that different
from playing in football pads and helmet.
   ``They're both forms of entertainment, but football is a group
thing,'' he said in an interview at the Bears' summer training
camp. ``When you dance, it's just you by yourself _ you have to do
the best you can against this audience to make these people want to
give you their money.''
   He said he started dancing in college for the extra cash and
keeps doing it because it's fun.
   ``You get a chance to be around a lot of girls,'' he said.
   His girlfriend likes his dancing, within limits.
   ``She hates for me to kiss the ladies when I'm out there dancing
_ but that's just part of getting the money _ you've got to tease
'em a little bit,'' Douglass said.

   Actors Lane Davies, who plays Mason Capwell
on NBC's daytime ``Santa Barbara,'' and Todd McKee, who plays his
little brother Ted, say they have left the show and plan a trip
around the world.
   ``It's not that I'm looking for another kind of challenge as far
as acting is concerned,'' Davies, 38, said while visiting his
family in Georgia last week. ``I'm just ready for a rest more than
a challenge. I've kind of `challenged' myself into an early grave.''
   The actors' characters have been absent from the program
recently, supposedly having left on a trip to Rome to save the
family business. After a brief stopover in Dalton, they left on the
first stage of their trip Saturday.
   ``I've been on the show for five years and I'm just restless,''
said McKee, 25. ``I've saved up some money and I thought this trip
would be a great idea. I sold a couple of homes that I had bought,
because it's nice to have some money in the bank.''

   She became engaged last month to lawyer Vaden Bales of Tulsa,
Okla., and they planned to wed before the end of the year.
   But they were wed July 25 while vacationing in Duck, N.C., The

   ``We decided there was no point in waiting,'' she said.
   In 1979, she married Chuck Vance, a former Secret Service agent

   Relatives of hostage Joseph James
Cicippio today waited two hours after the deadline for his
execution had passed before learning his pro-Iranian captors had
given him a 48-hour reprieve.
   ``It's good news for all of us,'' said Thomas Cicippio as he
stood on the front lawn of his house, flanked by two of his
brother's sons, Joseph Jr. and David. He then went inside to talk
to other family members.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization said Monday it would kill
Cicippio if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Moslem cleric seized by
Israeli commandos, was not released by 11 a.m. EDT. The group
announced the reprieve at 1:15 p.m. EDT.
   In between, family members anxiously awaited word of Cicippio's
fate.
   ``Now it becomes a waiting game,'' Thomas Cicippio said seven
minutes after the 11 a.m. deadline.
   Earlier today, Thomas Cicippio asked that Israel free Obeid and
that the United States and its allies refrain from military action,
while his sister-in-law, in Beirut, publicly asked the captors of
her 58-year-old husband to spare his life.
   Thomas Cicippio, standing on the front lawn of his house where
signs count the number of days his brother and other Americans have
been held hostage in Lebanon, asked of Israel: ``Please release
Sheik Obeid as quickly as possible. We must try to do everything we
possibly can to start peace movement once again.''
   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' Joseph Cicippio's wife,
Ilham, who works at the American Embassy in east Beirut, tearfully
pleaded today in Beirut.
   She read a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know the difficulty
of the situation in which we are, but all I ask you is to keep your
hopes high.''
   Obeid is a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers
holding Higgins and the 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon.
Eight of the 16 are Americans.
   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``The organization announces its quick resolve to execute the
death sentence against the American-Israeli spy Joseph Cicippio if
the struggling sheik is not released,'' his captors said in a
statement, adding the execution would be ``broadcast on all screens
in the world.''
   The statement, handwritten in Arabic, was delivered to the
independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar with a photograph of Cicippio.
   Thomas Cicippio said that before the latest developments, he was
becoming more hopeful.
   ``We've been watching the elections in Iran and I put a lot of
hope in (Iran's Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi) Rafsanjani helping
the U.S. gain release of the hostages.''
   Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist among Iran's religious
hierarchy, was elected president of Iran by a landslide majority
Saturday.

   A year-old state law allowing crime
victims to speak at sentencing hearings is bringing humanity into
the legal system, backers say.
   The law, patterned after similar measures in Michigan and
California, gives victims ``a maximum opportunity to participate,''
said Fran Sepler, executive director of the state Crime Victim and
Witness Advisory Council. The council pushed for what's known as
the right-to-allocution law.
   ``Allocution is sort of the Cadillac of victims' rights,'' said
Sepler, adding that other states are considering such laws.
   ``Everything I hear from people in the the criminal justice
process is that the law is working well and it's being handled in a
way that's not disruptive of the criminal justice system,'' said
state Sen. Richard Cohen, an author of the measure.
   ``It's allowed victims who are often given short shrift in the
process to have more of an opportunity to be a part of what's
taking place,'' said Cohen. ``They will have the satisfication of
the sentencing judge knowing exactly how they feel and what has
happened to them.''
   Since a guilty plea may leave a victim no opportunity to testify
at trial, ``this is the only absolute guarantee that the victim of
a crime has access to a judge in a case,'' he said.
   Sepler said she made a telephone check of 10 counties about six
months after the law took effect. Use of the right ranged from an
estimate of 40 percent to 60 percent in St. Louis County in
northeastern Minnesota to only seven or eight times in Hennepin
County, which has nearly 1 million residents and almost one-fourth
of the state's population.
   In California, where voters approved allocution in 1982, two
surveys released last year of judges and district attorneys
indicated that fewer than 5 percent of felony crime victims made
statements at sentencing hearings. The reasons cited were that
victims felt they could have little impact, they had already had
satisfactory involvement or they were afraid.
   In Michigan, ``very few take advantage of actually speaking,''
said Circuit Court Judge Michael Harrison.
   However, in at least half the crimes where there is an
identifiable victim, Harrison said they submit a statement that
state sentencing guidelines require judges to consider. Michigan's
crime victims' rights law has been in effect since July 1985.
   Sepler said Mothers Against Drunk Driving is advising members to
speak at sentencings.
   ``The feedback I get from judges is that they find these
statements very difficult to listen to, extremely painful; that it
injects an element of ... humanity into the courtroom that is
otherwise not there,'' she said.
   ``While there may not be substantial changes in sentencing ...
the victim impact statements are important considerations for them
as they determine things like mitigating and aggravating factors,''
said Sepler.
   The most publicized use of the new law came in May when more
than 300 people attended a hearing in suburban Inver Grove Heights
in the case of four teen-agers who vandalized a high school.
Resulting water damage and asbestos removal costs amounted to
millions of dollars.
   About 30 people testified during the orderly hearing in a
college auditorium. District Judge William Thuet, one of two judges
who gave students, faculty, staff and taxpayers standing as
victims, said the four teen-agers probably got more lenient
sentences _ none more than a year in jail _ because members of the
public ``were all asking that we be compassionate with these guys.''
   One measure of the success of the new law, said Sepler, is that
the dire consequences predicted by opponents haven't happened.
   Opponents felt that ``only those individuals who are articulate,
educated and well-off would use it and that it would be a step
backwards in jurisprudence,'' she said.
   ``And we would have irresponsible sentencing practices and
judges unable to dismiss irrelevant testimony and appeals based on
these statements,'' she added. ``That has not in any way, shape or
form come to be.''

<HEAD>Military Personnel Overseas Will Be Counted in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American military personnel stationed overseas
will be counted in the 1990 census, but the House on Tuesday
blocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens.
   The decision to include military personnel in the count was
announced by the Commerce Department at the start of a hearing on a
bill to require the action.
   According to Tuesday's announcement, the Census Bureau will work
with the Pentagon to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military
and civilian Defense Department workers overseas.
   At the same time the sometimes emotional debate over leaving out
undocumented aliens was under way both in committee and on the
House floor, where Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., failed in an effort to
attach the ban to an appropriations measure.
   His amendment was offered to a $5.8 billion appropriation bill
for running the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments next year,
including $800 million for carrying out the 1990 census. The bill
was approved by a vote of 258 to 165, and sent to the Senate.
   The dispute cuts close to home for the 435 House members, since
the Census count will be used to redistribute House seats among the
states. States which have grown in population will get more seats,
others will lose them.
   Many Northern states, already facing losses because of
population shifts to the South and West, fear additional gains by
the Sun Belt states and large urban centers because of the
settlement of illegal aliens in those areas.
   Hence, Ridge's amendment, rejected after extensive parliamentary
maneuvering.
   Opponents pointed out that the Constitution specifically
requires House seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons''
residing in a state.
   ``Every Census since the Constitution was created has counted
all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''
observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the
Census, responded Ridge.
   The count, scheduled for April 1, 1990, will cost $4 billion,
said Ridge, asserting that the Census Bureau has the money to
identify and separate out illegal aliens, but doesn't want to.
   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., contended that at the time the
Constitution was written there were no illegal aliens, all new
arrivals were welcome.
   Rep. Marvyn Dymally, D-Calif., countered that there have always
been undocumenmted aliens in this country. The difference is that
in the early days they came from Europe.
   The debate, Dymally said, is really over the fact that
population shifts will lead House seats to Southern and Western
states and that undocumented aliens are being blamed.
   ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down
to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a
seat,'' said Dymally.
   Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., however, said he cannot understand
why illegal aliens should be allowed to dilute the representation
of U.S. citizens.
   Counting illegal aliens ``is not fair. It may be Constitutional,
but it's just not right,'' said Valentine.
   ``The question is how are we going to identify those that are
here illegally that are not entitled to representation in this
body,'' said Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan. ``That will be tough to do
... the least we should so is to make that extraordinary effort.''
   ``You're now asking the Bureau of the Census to be judge and
jury in determining who should be counted,'' responded Rep. Robert
Garcia, D-N.Y.
   The questions of counting undocumented aliens and overseas
military personnal have been tied together in many debates, with
the question raised of the fairness of including illegal aliens but
not American servicemen and servicewomen in the figures used for
apportionment.
   In the past, service members overseas generally have not been
included in census counts used to apportion seats in the House of
Representatives.
   That is because census officials considered it impossible to
determine accurately in which state an individual should be
counted. Many military people move often.
   The Census Bureau said it will investigate ways to make that
judgment in the 1990 census. Possibilities include listing a
service person's last state of residence for more than six months,
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.
   Census officials have generally opposed any attempt to delete
illegal aliens, contending that they have no method of determining
who is in the country legally. Asking people about their status
would likely result in people lying or refusing to participate in
the count, officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of
residents in many areas.

   The Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary
Committee, on a pair of 7-7 tie votes, today killed William Lucas'
nomination to be the nation's top civil rights enforcer.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blamed the rejection on ``raw
politics,'' but administration officials said they would not seek
to overturn the committee's decision on the floor of the Senate.
   The committee first deadlocked 7-7 on a motion to approve the
nomination, leaving Lucas one vote short of the majority he needed.
On an identical vote, the panel then rejected a Republican move to
send the nomination to the floor without recommendation.
   All six committee Republicans and Democrat Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona voted in favor of Lucas, a black Democrat-turned-Republican
who served as Wayne County sheriff in Michigan. All the no votes
were cast by Democrats.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
committee's action ``is very disappointing to the president. ... We
felt he (Lucas) deserved better treatment and he deserved that
position.''
   ``In terms of where we go from here, we're now exploring our
options,'' Fitzwater added.
   The committee's action was a stinging defeat for President Bush,
who said last week he supported Lucas ``100 percent'' and was
convinced ``that much _ not all _ that much of the criticism of him
is pure American politics.''
   But Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a conservative southerner who
cast a critical vote against Lucas, said, ``He's lacking in
experience and qualifications, his managerial accomplishments are
debatable.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said on the Senate floor that
he had urged Bush to make a so-called recess appointment under
which Lucas could serve in the post for a number of months without
being confirmed.
   Bush could make such an appointment as soon as Congress
recesses, scheduled for the end of the week. ``If they will not
give him the simple chance to make his case, then the president of
the United States should do so with a recess appointment,'' Dole
said.
   Asked about Dole's suggestion, Fitzwater said, ``No decisions
have been made...about either Mr. Lucas' future or how we might
approach the job at the Justice Department.''
   Lucas was opposed by many civil rights groups who said he was
not a strong enough advocate for affirmative action and other
traditional civil rights concerns.
   He told the committee it was too early to evaluate recent
Supreme Court decisions narrowing the scope of civil rights laws on
job bias, minority set-asides and other issues. He also declined
invitations from senators to express concern about the direction
the country is taking in civil rights matters.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel conceded defeat for
the nomination and said the agency had no other candidates ``as of
today.''
   Lucas had no immediate comment. Runkel said he would continue to
work at the Justice Department as a $284.50-per-day consultant
until he completes an analysis of the department's role in
enforcing civil rights. The contract is up March 20, 1990.
   ``As a result of raw politics, a man who has demonstrated his
ability over a 40-year time span as a social worker, police
officer, an FBI agent, a sheriff and a county government leader to
make a difference for the benefit of many Americans has been denied
the opportunity to continue to serve,'' Thornburgh said.
   Republicans compared the committee's rejection of Lucas to the
Senate's refusal to confirm Robert Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., accused critics of refusing to ``give
this black man a chance.''
   ``He's a minority, of course. Years ago minorities didn't have a
chance, I know,'' said Thurmond, who was one of the Senate's most
implacable opponents of civil rights in the era of racial
segregation.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
Thurmond's accusation amounted to ``a cynical setup'' because most
of the critics were supporters of civil rights and were concerned
mainly about Lucas' qualifications.
   ``It seems to me that Bill Lucas has failed miserably to prove
that he has some knowledge to compensate for his lack of
experience,'' Biden said.
   After the committee rejected confirmation, Thurmond moved to
send the nomination to the floor without any recommendation. But
that was blocked on an identical 7-7 vote.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was the last Republican to fall into
line behind Lucas, telling a news conference last week that ``it's
more important to have someone who understands Supreme Court
decisions from personal experience, knows it, so to speak, in his
gut, as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the commas
and semicolons.''
   Civil rights groups have campaigned against Lucas, saying he
lacks experience. Committee Republicans contend that the
61-year-old black nominee would apply the lessons he learned in his
rise from dishwasher to FBI agent to Wayne County, Mich., sheriff
and county executive.
   Lucas also came under fire for failing to declare $8,884 worth
of goods to U.S. Customs following an Asian trip, not making
court-ordered jail improvements when he was Wayne County sheriff
and for inaccuracies on an application for admission to the New
York bar. Critics also accused him of a conflict of interest
involving a county building project and cited court findings that
he was lax in investigating police brutality charges.
   On the customs matter, Lucas said he was not aware the goods
were in his family's luggage. He said he did his best on jail
improvements and ultimately was responsible for a new jail. He said
he saw no conflict of interest on the county building project and
investigated the police brutality charges as soon as he found out
about them.
   The panel had scheduled a vote for last Thursday, but delayed
action after Heflin said he wanted more time to look into new
allegations. The nature of those allegations was unknown.
   Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had
said they would oppose Lucas.
   ``For assistant attorney general for civil rights, I just think
that we need a strong voice who will speak out for civil rights and
I don't hear that coming from Bill Lucas,'' Simon said.
   His supporters, including the Rev. Joseph Lowery of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said there was no practical way
for him to oppose Bush administration policy, which holds that it
will take time to assess the impact of the Supreme Court decisions.
   Simon and other lawmakers, however, said Lucas appeared to lack
sufficient zeal for civil rights.

<HEAD>Japanese Military Used Blank Anti-Aircraft Shells, Soldier Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Japanese soldier said Tuesday that
anti-aircraft gunners fired blank shells at U.S. bombers in the
final months of World War II so civilians wouldn't realize
ammunition was running out.
   Kiyoshi Tsujibayashi said about one out of every four shells
fired by his regiment, which manned anti-aircraft guns protecting
southern Osaka, was a blank.
   Tsujibayashi, who was a lance corporal, said soldiers were
secretly ordered to fire the blanks, which contained only a small
amount of gunpowder, beginning in June 1945 to maintain civilian
morale and avoid criticism that the military was not doing enough
to defend the people. The war ended in August.
   Even when ammunition was available for the regiment's 48 guns,
the shells were unable to reach the height at which the American
B-29 bombers were flying, Tsujibayashi said in a telephone
interview.
   Tsujibayashi, the owner of a supermarket near Osaka, said his
regiment was told in March 1945 to avoid useless firing to conserve
dwindling ammunition.
   As the U.S. bombings intensified, ``we were told to use the
blanks to avoid criticism from the public that we weren't doing our
job,'' he said.
   Tsujibayashi, 63, said he decided to share his story to let
others know about the actual situation during the war.
   Defense officials were not available for comment on the report.

   Captors threatening to kill American
hostage Joseph James Cicippio if Israel does not release a
kidnapped Shiite Moslem cleric said today they have extended the
deadline for his execution by 48 hours.
   Cicippio's wife pleaded with his captors to spare his life
today, a day after kidnappers said they hanged a U.S. Marine
because of the cleric's abduction.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization announced the reprieve in
a 13-line handwritten statement in Arabic delivered to the
independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar at 8:15 p.m. (1:15 EDT).
   It was more than two hours after the original deadline set by
the extremists in a statement Monday for a verdict on Cicippio. The
statement was accompanied by an authenticating snapshot of another
U.S. hostage, author Edward Austin Tracy, also held by the group.
   Also today, a deadline set by kidnappers for a British hostage,
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, passed with no immediate word
from his captors.
   The reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and
the threat today against Cicippio presented President Bush with his
first major hostage crisis.
   The United Nations said its top peacekeeping official, Marrack
Goulding, left for the Lebanese capital to try to recover Higgins's
body. He is expected to arrive Wednesday.
   Cicippio's wife, Ilham, tearfully pleaded with his captors today.
   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' she said at a news
conference at the press center in east Beirut's Jedeideh area.
   She read out a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know the
difficulty of the situation in which we are but all I ask you is to
keep your hopes high.''
   On Monday, the pro-Iranian Shiite group that abducted Higgins,
the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, released a videotape of
a man they said was Higgins dangling from a gallows.
   Higgins commanded a group of U.N. truce observers in south
Lebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization had issued a statement
Monday saying it would announce the hour of Cicippio's
``execution'' if Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid was not freed by 6 p.m.
today (11 a.m. EDT). The reprieve announced later today apparently
extends the deadline to 6 p.m. Thursday.
   Israel has refused to release Obeid and two companions captured
with him. Jerusalem has said it would swap him and other Shiite
Moslem prisoners for three Israeli soldiers and other foreigners
held hostage in Lebanon.
   Today, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah rejected the offer and said
Israel and the United States were responsible for any retaliation
against Western hostages taken by Islamic groups.
   ``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid and his two colleagues be released,'' said a statement by
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The cleric is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, the organization
believed to be an umbrella group for the kidnappers of Higgins and
the 16 other Westerners missing in Lebanon. Eight of the 16 are
Americans.
   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller at the
American University of Beirut when he was kidnapped on the campus
on Sept. 12, 1986. Mrs. Cicippio, 34, works at the American Embassy
in east Beirut and lives on the campus.
   The photograph released today of Tracy, 58, showed the
silver-haired Burlington, Vermont man from the waist up, sporting a
bushy white beard and wearing a navy blue tracksuit. It was the
first picture of him released by the captors since March 8. Tracy
disappeared in October 1986.
   This morning, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
Oppressed on Earth said in a call to a Beirut radio station that
Waite would be killed by midnight (5 p.m. EDT) unless Israel frees
Obeid.
   There was no way to determine the authenticity of the threat,
made to the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
the group told The Associated Press on Monday that the group would
kill Waite at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) today, but the deadline passed
with no immediate word from the captors.
   It could not be immediately verified if that caller was from the
organization, which had not made previous calls to the AP office in
Cyprus.
   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the release
of foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel to
negotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,
though no group has claimed responsibility.
   Higgins' reported hanging was clouded by doubt because of
previous reports he may have been killed months ago, and Lebanese
police said they could not confirm the claimed Higgins killing on
Monday. Nevertheless, the claim and the videotape that accompanied
it met with revulsion worldwide.
   Bush condemned the reported killing of the U.S. Marine and
called on ``all parties'' holding hostages in the Middle East to
release them. He cut short a two-day Western trip and met with top
advisers in Washington, and an administration source said officials
were considering how to respond.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
military action has not been ruled out.
   Bush briefed congressional leaders Monday night, and one of the
lawmakers said the White House made clear the United States had
been kept in the dark about Israel's plan to kidnap Obeid.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today suggested
Israel was conducting negotiations with Shiite groups to obtain the
release of Israeli prisoners and Western hostages.
   Asked whether Israeli was engaged in contacts with Shiite groups
in Lebanon, Shamir told reporters ``there are permanent contacts
with various factors about the release of the hostages.''
   Israeli sources said the decision to abduct Obeid had triggered
deep divisions in the government. Shamir defended the abduction,
saying it was made to help free Israeli and Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said before the
reported hanging that his country condemns ``any kind of kidnapping
or death threat.''
   Israeli fighter jets swooped over strongholds of the Shiite
fundamentalists in Lebanon at daybreak today, drawing gunfire from
Hezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of Baalbek, police said.
   A police spokesman said no hits were scored and the planes did
not attempt to bomb east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, where more than
4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards attached to Hezbollah are based.
   In West Germany today, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said
the captors of two West Germans have demanded the release of
convicted hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi and his brother, Abbas.
   The spokesman in Karlsruhe, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said the
demands were relayed to the West German Embassy in Beirut, but he
did not indicate when or how. A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn
refused comment on Foerster's report.
   No one has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Thomas Kemptner
and Heinrich Struebig, who were abducted May 16.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for the AP, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   President Bush today weighed U.S. options for
responding to the reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins by his Lebanese kidnappers, and military action is ``in the
realm of the possible,'' an administration source said.
   Officials emphasized, however, that Bush had not decided on a
course of action, and one source said that both a potential hostage
rescue operation and a military strike were ``not attractive
options.''
   Administration officials said diplomatic contacts were under way
in the meantime.
   White House officials said they were still trying to gather the
facts. ``We still cannot offer any confirmation of his death or the
circumstances surrounding it,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush met for 90 minutes with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and other top administration officials to review the
intelligence from Lebanon. ``This session was primarily
informational,'' Fitzwater said.
   He emphasized the White House was going about other business as
well, and Bush still planned to host a barbecue for members of
Congress this evening.
   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere,'' the spokesman
said.
   Fitzwater said the United States was in contact with all
countries in the region, but there was no direct communication with
Iran, which backs Moslem militants believed to have seized Higgins
in February 1988.
   At the State Department, however, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States has sent messages to Iran through
``established channels.''
   The message, also sent to other countries, is that ``there can
be no excuse for the killings of our hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
``This is outrageous behavior. It is uncivilized. It excludes who
take this action or support it from the community of civilized
nations.''
   Other officials said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
was asked by Baker during a meeting in Paris on Monday to convey
U.S. concerns to Iranian authorities when her visits Tehran this
week.
   Fitzwater reiterated Bush's call on all parties to release
hostages. Asked if the United States regarded Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid, a Shiite Muslim cleric seized in Lebanon by Israel, as a
hostage or a prisoner, the spokesman said: ``I don't want to
dictate any political terms for political purposes. ... It's pretty
clear he was kidnapped.''
   Asked about reports that terrorists have delayed by 48 hours
their threat to kill another American hostage, Joseph James
Cicippio, Fitzwater said, ``We feel there should be no deadlines,
there should be no hostages.''
   Bush on Monday issued ``an urgent call to all, all parties, who
hold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as a
humanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in
that region.''
   One U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
said there was still no final confirmation that Higgins was the
person seen hanging in the videotape released by the Shiite Moslem
kidnappers.
   The official said ``nothing has been ruled out'' in retaliation
for the reported execution of the 44-year-old Higgins, who was
assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force.
   As for the possibility of military action, the source said,
``It's in the realm of the possible.''
   ``No one is tilted in that direction. It's on the menu. No one's
ordered it ... We're not leaning necessarily toward anything,''
said the official. ``People are discussing the options. We are not
at the specific choosing stage.''
   Presidential assistant Stephen M. Studdert said Bush was
concerned ``that every military option, for example, has with it
the possibility that those sites may be a place where American or,
in the case of Terry Waite, British hostages, are held.''
   He said Chief of Staff John Sununu discussed ``the constraints
of military options'' at some length in a staff meeting.
   A source described the president as ``outraged, incensed, but
cognizant of the limitations on his options and the need to be
responsible. He doesn't believe you should fight terror with
terror.''
   The reported execution of Higgins touched off the first foreign
policy crisis of the Bush administration. It also led the president
to criticize Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric from
Lebanon on Friday. Higgins' kidnappers cited the Israeli action in
announcing the American's execution by hanging.
   ``On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was not
helpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement,''
Bush said Monday night.
   Israel today welcomed Bush's call for release of the hostages
and said its offer to swap the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, for
Western hostages and Israeli captives still stands.
   An Israeli Embassy spokesman, David Peleg, said today that
Israel carried out the abduction ``only after we reached the
conclusion that all other means had failed to gain the release of
our hostages, not the Americans.''
   Administration officials said Ambassador William Brown met with
a top Israeli official early today to discuss the situation.
   Meanwhile, former hostage David Jacobsen told CBS News and the
Los Angeles Times that the abduction of Obeid may have destroyed
chances for the release of Associated Press correspondent Terry
Anderson, the longest-held of the eight current American hostages.
   ``All the reports were that Terry Anderson was to be released
last Saturday night, and because of the kidnapping of the sheik
that obviously was postpned,'' Jacobsen told CBS today.
   Observers in Washington and the Middle East, and Anderson's
sister Peggy Say, they had not heard any such report.
   Bush cut short a two-day Western trip on Monday and returned to
Washington after learning that Higgins' captors had released a
videotape they said showed his execution. The president met with
his top advisers before briefing congressional leaders Monday night.
   While Bush publicly said he had no independent confirmation of
Higgins' death, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said the
president told the lawmakers that ``it's about a 98 percent
probability'' that Higgins had indeed been killed.
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
said Bush was considering ``several options'' to respond to
Higgins' death. But like other lawmakers at Monday night's meeting,
he declined to identify them.
   Earlier, Dole, R-Kan., had criticized Israel for its role in
touching off the crisis. Declaring that Israel launched the
commando raid to abduct Obeid without forewarning the United
States, Dole said, ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on behalf
of the Israelis would be refreshing.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, without
elaborating, ``It's fair to say that many people do share the
senator's concerns.''
   Israeli officials rejected criticism of their commando raid,
saying Obeid had helped plan and carry out several terrorist
operations including Higgins' kidnapping in February 1988. Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said blaming Israel for Higgins' death
would be ``turning the world on its head.''
   One administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said U.S. officials had more meetings planned on the crisis, and it
was premature to say Bush had ruled out military retaliation or
rescue missions.
   The White House made clear to congressional leaders that the
United States had been kept in the dark about Israel's plan to
kidnap Obeid on Friday, according to one lawmaker who attended the
briefing.
   Israel says Obeid is a leader of a pro-Iranian group that is
holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. An Israeli Army spokesman said
Obeid admitted he was involved in Higgins' kidnapping.

   Austrian conductor Herbert von

concerts and operas as his ``musical legacy,'' the Swiss executor
of his will said Tuesday.
   Lawyer Werner Kupper said the first three recordings were

   He declined comment on the financial dispositions of the will,
which was opened Monday at Samaden, near St. Moritz, where Karajan
had a residence.
   The fortune of the conductor, who is survived by his wife,
Eoeliette, and two daughters, has been estimated in published
reports at about $242 million. There was no word from Swiss and
Austrian authorities on the inheritance tax claims.

   The nation's governors concluded a harmonious
four-day meeting today with a mildly worded resolution urging the
government to reduce the deficit and protect domestic spending
without raising taxes _ if possible.
   During their annual meeting, the governors also skirted abortion
and other policy differences and were summoned to a meeting on
education next month with President Bush.
   Democratic and Republican governors met separately over
breakfast to discuss their parties' prospects in the Virginia and
New Jersey governors races this year and the outlook for the 36
governorships up in 1990.
   Both groups met in private, with Democratic National Chairman
Ron Brown addressing his party's governors. The Democrats elected
Ohio's Richard Celeste to be chairman of the Democratic Governors'
Association, beginning in January.
   Iowa Republican Terry Branstad was installed as new chairman of
the bipartisan National Governors' Association, and Democrat Booth
Gardner of Washington was selected to serve as vice chairman to
follow Branstad as chairman in a year.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather spoke to the final full session of the
National Governors' Association conference, saying, ``You who
already have the toughest job in American politics have got to take
the lead in convincing the president and Congress that the present
approach to education policy is a mess and needs immediate
overhaul, and the present approach to the federal budget deficit is
an Alice in Wonderland fantasy.''
   Before heading home today, the governors approved a series of
policy statements, including a cautiously worded one urging the
government to reduce the deficit without raising taxes ``if
possible,'' while protecting key domestic spending.
   The governors also approved a resolution urging Congress and the
Bush administration to impose a two-year moratorium on expanded
Medicaid coverage that the states would be required to pay for.
   Other policy matters under consideration included allowing
students and parents to select public schools of their choice
``consistent with desegregation goals,'' and tougher steps against
drug smuggling, including requiring cooperation in anti-drug
efforts for countries to receive U.S. foreign aid.
   Some of the governors headed home early, skipping the last
session. One was Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who said he needed to
deal with forest fires that have become ``totally out of control.''
   Bush, whose appearance at the conference was overshadowed Monday
by the reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins by
pro-Iranian captors in Lebanon, invited the governors to meet with
him in late September for a summit meeting on education. The
meeting, at a site to be named later, was a campaign promise of
Bush and was discussed by governors last spring.
   Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, who was being
replaced as chairman of the governors' association by Republican
Terry Branstad of Iowa, said, ``We're impressed with the
accessibility and indications of a cooperative attitude'' from Bush.
   Democrat Bill Clinton of Arkansas said the summit will keep
education and child-related issues on the public agenda.
   But Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, said Bush's remarks
were too little considering Bush's campaign claim to be ``the
education president.'' He called the speech ``uninspired and
uninspiring.''
   ``It lacked any real vision or any real voltage in terms of
getting us moving now,'' said Celeste, in one of the few public
criticisms of the administration voiced at the conference.
   Celeste said the education meeting would discuss a dampening
effect on state and local education initiatives created by the
budget climate and Bush's flat opposition to new taxes.
   ``The president's posture last year in the election really
chilled efforts at education reform and education finance in many
parts of this country,'' Celeste said. ``The president is in a
unique position to sound the trumpet _ and I didn't hear any brass
this morning.''
   Governors of both parties met in private over breakfast before
Bush's remarks, and several governors said bipartisan concern was
voiced over federal Medicaid requirements that force states to
spend more on health care without compensation from the federal
government.
   In a question-and-answer session with Bush, Celeste asked the
president to consider a two-year moratorium on additional Medicaid
requirements, which he later described as the fastest growing
spending item in his state budget.
   Bush did not commit himself to such a moratorium but said, ``I'd
like to consider it, and certainly we're trying to hold the line on
spiraling costs.''
   Bush and his Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner suggested
they were sympathetic with the governors' request that surplus
federal transportation trust funds be released, but made no
promises of money. The trust funds for highways and airport
facilities contain up to $19 billion, according to governors, who
contend much of that is being withheld from the states so it can
count against the deficit in the federal budget.
   ``It is important that we begin to spend the balances of the
trust fund as soon as possible on mass transit, highways and
aviation infrastructure,'' Skinner said.
   Scientist Carl Sagan urged the governors to support steps to
counter the environmental threats of ozone depletion and global
warming, including a ban on chlorofluorocarbons and increased use
of alternative fuels. Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals found in
such products as coolants, cleaning solvents and plastic food
containers.
   ``It is a problem that's extremely serious and will not be
solved by business as usual,'' said Sagan.

   The United States asked the Soviet
Union today to use its influence with Iran for release of American
and other Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The request was part of a U.S.-Soviet meeting on Afghanistan in
which John Kelly, assistant U.S. secretary of state, met with
Nikolai Kozyrev a Soviet ambassador. No agreement on the issue was
reached.
   ``We asked the Soviet Union to use its good offices to influence
the Iranian government to bring about their safe and immediate
release,'' Kelly told reporters after the two-day meeting.
   Kidnappers on Monday said they killed a U.S. Marine, Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins. Eight other Americans, four Britons, one
Irishman, one Italian and two West Germans are believed to be held
captive in Lebanon by pro-Iranian kidnapers.
   It was the first superpower meeting on Afghanistan since the
Soviet Union finished withdrawing troops from the country in
mid-February.
   Kelly said there were still ``significant differences'' between
the parties on the Afghan issue and regretted that there had been
``no agreement at all.'' Kelly said there were still ``significant
differences'' between the parties on the Afghan issue and regretted
that there had been ``no agreement at all.'' The Soviets have
complained of U.S. aid to rebels trying to overthrow the
Moscow-backed Afghan government.
   Kozyrev said there would be further talks.

cleric, and the Tuesday deadline for killing an American hostage
was extended for two days.
   The captors of Joseph Cicippio acknowledged a plea for mercy
from his Lebanese wife in announcing the 48-hour postponement.
   On Monday, after the group holding Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
said he had been hanged, Cicippio's kidnappers said he would be
killed unless Israel freed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by 6 p.m.
Tuesday (11 a.m. EDT). The reprieve was announced two hours after
the deadline.
   Also threatened with death is Anglican church envoy Terry Waite,
50, a Briton who disappared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel
in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the release of American
hostages. There was no immediate word on his fate.
   Obeid is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group believed to be an umbrella for
hostage takers. Hezbollah also is said to have two of three Israeli
soldiers held prisoner in south Lebanon.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel suggested Tuesday that
Israel was conducting negotiations with pro-Iranian Shiite groups
to win freedom for the soldiers and Western hostages in a trade for
Obeid and other Shiites.
   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Ilham, called a news conference
Tuesday and appealed to those holding her husband: ``In these
fateful minutes, I appeal to all of you to spare no effort to give
him a chance, so he will be able to prove to you that he is
innocent of all guilt.''
   Her 58-year-old husband was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. He was
acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut.
   In Washington, President Bush weighed a response to the killing
of Higgins, a 44-year-old U.S. Marine officer on U.N. duty in
Lebanon. An administrative source said military action was ``in the
realm of the possible,'' but officials said it was not an
``attractive'' option.
   Israeli warplanes swooped over Hezbollah strongholds in south
Lebanon at daybreak Tuesday but did not attack. Ground-to-air
barrages from Hezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of Baalbek
scored no hits, police said.
   On Monday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization issued a
statement in Arabic, accompanied by a photograph of Cicippio,
saying a time would be set for his ``execution'' unless Obeid was
released by 6 p.m. Tuesday.
   It said at 8:15 p.m. (1:15 p.m. EDT) Tuesday, in a 13-line
handwritten statement in Arabic delivered to the Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar, that the deadline had been postponed. The statement was
accompanied by an authenticating photo of Edward Austin Tracy,
another American hostage held by the group.
   The photograph showed Tracy, 58, from the waist up, in the first
picture of him released since March 8. He had white hair and a
bushy white beard, and wore a navy blue track suit.
   ``Due to the friendly appeals and sincere behests as well as
some special factors and the moving plea by Cicippio's wife, the
Revolutionary Justice Organization declares the unextendable
postponement of the execution deadline by 48 hours only,'' the
statement said.
   ``Those concerned should realize that any other attempts to
wrest a new postponement will be futile.''
   Revolutionary Justice's original threat to Cicippio arrived at
An-Nahar a few hours after a group calling itself the Organization
of the Oppressed on Earth said it had killed Higgins. It released a
poor-quality videotape showing a man who appeared to be the Marine
officer dangling from a scaffold.
   When the tape was made could not be determined. There have been
reports Higgins was killed months ago.
   Hezbollah declared Tuesday, as it has before, that it has no
connection with hostage-taking, and said of the Israeli offer:
``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid
and his two colleagues be released.
   ``The United States and Israel jointly bear the responsibility
for the kidnapping crime and the continuation of their detention.
They also bear the responsibility for every reaction from the sons
of Islam and the oppressed in Lebanon and the world.''
   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid and two associates Friday from
the sheik's home in the southern Lebanon village of Jibchit.
   The mainstream Shiite militia Amal, Hezbollah's rival, has said
it holds Israeli airman Ron Arad, captured after his plane crashed
in south Lebanon while on a bombing mission on Oct. 16, 1986.
Hezbollah is believed to hold two other Israeli soldiers captured
while on patrol in February 1986.
   Israel has said it would trade Obeid and the other 50-60
Lebanese Shiites it holds for the three soldiers and Western
hostages held in Lebanon, who totaled 17 with Higgins and include
eight other Americans.
   Higgins commanded a 75-man U.N. truce observer team when he was
abducted Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon.
   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping,
left for Lebanon on Tuesday to try to recover the colonel's body.
   Two anonymous telephone callers to news media in Cyprus and
Beirut made the threats to Waite. The first deadline of 3 p.m. (8
a.m. EDT) Tuesday passed and the second caller said it had been
extended until midnight (5 p.m. EDT).
   Shamir's spokesman in Jerusalem hinted at indirect negotiations
through through the Red Cross or some other intermediary. In
Geneva, the Red Cross denied involvement.
   On Monday night, Bush issued ``an urgent call to all, all
parties, who hold hostages in the Middle East to release them
forthwith, as a humanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle
of violence in that region.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry said: ``We resolutely
denounce this inhuman action. The fact that the aggravation of the
situation in Lebanon, caused specifically by the abduction of
Shiite leader Sheik Obeid by Israeli commandos, has led to an
escalation of acts of violence and terror and evokes profound
concern.''
   The Hezbollah statement said the trade outlined by Israel's
defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was ``a stupid move ... that
deserves only ridicule and disdain.''
   Hezbollah said it had ``nothing to do'' with Western hostages.
   ``We see no comparison between Zionist invaders captured on our
land during a confrontation against the Zionist occupation that
mirrors the ugliest form of terrorim and the Zionist abduction of a
cleric while he was asleep at his home in his town inside Lebanese
territory,'' Hezbollah said in the statement, which was telephoned
to The Associated Press office in Beirut.
   Israeli said Obeid was involved in planning attacks on Israel
and had confessed to directing seizure of Higgins.
   Aside from the Americans, the hostages in Lebanon are four
Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, the federal prosecutor's office said
Tuesday those holding the two West German relief workers had
demanded the release of convicted hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi and
his brother, Abbas. Spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster said the
demands were relayed to the West German Embassy in Beirut, but did
not say when or how.
   A Frenkfurt court sentenced Mohammed Hamadi to life in prison
for murder and air piracy in the 1985 TWA hijacking in which a U.S.
Navy diver was killed and 33 Americans were held hostage 17 days.
   Abbas Hamadi is serving 13 years for helping kidnap two West
Germans in 1987 to try to get his brother freed. The hostages later
were released.

<HEAD>Conference Votes on Peacekeeping Mission To Cambodia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   An international conference agreed Tuesday to send
a fact-finding mission to Cambodia in what the French foreign
minister called ``a great first step'' toward peace in the
Southeast Asian nation.
   With the promised pullout of Vietnamese troops less than two
months away, the mission will gather information that would allow
an international control mechanism to monitor the withdrawal and a
cease-fire among combatants.
   As members of 20 delegations were leaving the turn-of-century
conference hall, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told
reporters unanimous agreement had been reached on a work program
and structure for the month-long meeting.
   ``This constitutes a great first step forward on the path which
should provide a return to peace in this country,'' said Dumas, who
is leading the conference with his Indonesian counterpart, Ali
Alatas.
   Agreements authorizing the fact-finding mission and setting out
tasks for four working groups for the next month were set out in a
four-page document approved unanimously Tuesday after hard
bargaining.
   The conference, described as one of the most complex peace
initiatives of recent times, is trying to halt hostilities between
a three-party guerrilla Cambodian coalition led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.
   It also is trying to prevent the return to power of the Khmer
Rouge, who are members of Sihanouk's coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge turned Cambodia into a vast slave labor camp in
which hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of
disease and hunger.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan reportedly made a number of
objections on conference organization and procedure but then went
along with the majority after Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
met with Monday with him, Sihanouk and the third member of their
loose alliance, Son Sann.
   In turn, Vietnam and the Cambodian government of Prime Minister
Hun Sen agreed to the fact-finding mission under the auspices of
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The two have
opposed U.N. involvement because the world body recognizes
Sihanouk's coalition rather than Hun Sen's government.
   The delegates also agreed to set up four working commissions to
deal with the international control mechanism, international
guarantees, refugees and reconstruction and Cambodia's internal
problems. These commissions are to begin their work this week
following three days of minister-level speeches and closed-door
debate.
   ``The agreement on procedure reflects a convergence of political
will...to finally put an end to war, conflict and immense suffering
of the Cambodian people,'' Alatas said.
   Despite the notes of optimism as the first phase of the
conference ended, crucial issues remained unresolved including the
future role if any of the Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnam and Hun Sen are opposed to any Khmer Rouge role in a
future government, saying the guerrillas would only try to grab
power and launch another murderous revolution.
   ``No one wants to establish high expectations. It's going to be
a lot of work in the next four weeks,'' Canadian Foreign Minister
Joe Clark told reporters.
   Other conference participants doubted a comprehensive settlement
could be reached by the time the foreign ministers return to Paris
to conclude the conference Aug. 28-30.
   Dumas said the fact-finding mission would be dispatched ``very
quickly'' to all areas of Cambodia and concerned countries. In the
past the Khmer Rouge have barred outsiders to their military camps
along the Thai-Cambodian border, including doctors and aid workers
from international aid agencies.
   The Khmer Rouge initially opposed this mission as well as the
committee to deal with Cambodia's internal strife.

<HEAD>Studdert Resigns Amid Speculation He Wants to Run for Governor of
Utah</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Studdert, who has coordinated public
events for President Bush during his campaign and presidency,
submitted his resignation Tuesday amid speculation he wants to run
for governor in his home state of Utah.
   His job as assistant to the president for special activities and
initiatives has been offered to Sig Rogich, a political and
advertising consultant from Nevada. But Rogich is deciding whether
to take the job, Studdert said.
   Studdert, 40, said he will return to Utah and has no present
plans to run for governor. But, he said, ``I don't close the door
on any option for the future.''
   However, he said in an interview, Republican Gov. Norman H.
Bangerter is a ``close personal friend'' and if Bangerter chooses
to run again in 1992, ``I'd support him in a minute.''
   Studdert's first assignment when he came to the White House to
head President Reagan's advance office was to coordinate the return
of the 52 American hostages who had been held captive in Iran for
444 days.
   That day, Jan. 20, 1981, brought what he called the most
poignant moments of his life, he said.
   He had obtained a Navy band at the last minute to meet the
hostages at Andrews Air Force Base. ``I'll never forget the
trombone player marching by playing `Tie a Yellow Ribbon' with
tears running down his cheeks,'' Studdert said.
   Despite White House rumors that there was some agitation for
Studdert's departure after a few presidential appearances did not
go smoothly, he said both Bush and Chief of Staff John Sununu
``strongly counseled me to stay,'' and asked him to reconsider his
decision to resign.
   But he said he and his wife decided they wanted to return to
Utah for a more quiet life with their six children in the tiny town
of Highland.
   When he agreed to join the Bush presidential campaign last year
Studdert said he had not really wanted to leave his private
consulting business, nor did he particularly want to come back to
work at the White House.
   ``I just can't say no to the guy,'' he said of Bush. In his
resignation letter, the former advance man told Bush that during
his years in Washington ``nothing has been more satisfying than to
serve you and Mrs. Bush.''
   He later told reporters: ``I have the best job in the entire
federal government. I have a fun job. I love what I do and Bush
makes it so. It's been very, very hard for me to make this
decision.''
   He said he has traveled ``almost 5 million miles'' in his
efforts to set up where the president will appear and how those
appearances will look.

<HEAD>Drug Strategy Draft Focuses on Law Enforcement, Inner City Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national drug strategy presented to Cabinet
officers focuses on law enforcement and stresses a need to rid
inner cities of illegal drugs, according to administration
officials who have seen the document.
   ``The predominant theme is the inner city,'' one administration
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday.
   ``A paramount target of law-enforcement activity, especially at
the local level, must be the disruption of those street markets for
drugs in which retail demand and supply finally meet in a
combustible mix,'' the report said, according to a source.
   The strategy report _ required by the 1988 antidrug law that
created the Office of National Drug Control Strategy _ strongly
reflects public comments made by director William J. Bennett since
he took office five months ago. The final report is due Sept. 5.
   ``It reads like one of his speeches,'' said one source.
   Bennett has said repeatedly that the war against drugs must be
fought on all fronts _ enforcement, prevention and treatment _ and
that the nation must do more and do better on each of those fronts.
The report reflects that attitude.
   ``No single strategy, pursued alone or to the detriment of other
possible and valuable initiatives, can work to contain or reduce
drug use,'' the strategy says.
   What that means in terms of money was not immediately clear, as
the draft strategy circulated Monday included no budget figures
that might reflect the exact priorities. It also did not include a
classified strategy on international and interdiction policies that
is under review by the National Security Council.
   In an interview in June, Bennett said he expected to call for
more money for drug treatment and probably more for prevention.
Asked whether that meant less, proportionally, for law enforcement,
he said, ``No, not necessarily.''
   Last week, Bennett said the escalating cost of the drug war may
eventually lead to the need for a tax hike.
   The strategy focuses on the highly-addictive, smokeable form of
cocaine called crack, and denounces any move to decriminalize any
kind of illegal drug, despite some officials' claims that such
action might cut down on drug-related violence.
   ``Legalizing drugs would be an unqualified national disaster,''
the report says. ``In fact, any significant relaxation of drug
enforcement _ for whatever reason, however well-intentioned _ would
promise more use, more crime, and more trouble for treatment and
education efforts.''
   Instead, the report says, ``We should be tough on drugs, much
tougher than we are now.''
   The New York Times reported on the strategy in Tuesday's
editions.
   The strategy reflects Bennett's past statements that education
and treatment programs must be tied to strong law enforcement to be
effective. On numerous occasions, Bennett has told of treatment
specialists who say arrests of drug users are what spur them into
treatment and keep them there.
   The strategy includes proposed antidrug legislation for states
that closely resembles outlines Bennett provided two weeks ago to
the American Legislative Exchange Council, a gathering of state
legislators at Monterey, Calif., according to one source.
   At the meeting, Bennett urged the legislators to take a range of
actions, from hiring more police, judges and prosecutors and
building more prisons to ensure certain and prompt punishment of
drug offenders, to imposing civil fines of up to $10,000 for those
convicted of possessing small amounts of drugs.
   Bennett has warned that states and educational institutions that
fail to impose some antidrug laws could risk losing federal money.
   In the most recent stategy draft, that threat takes the form of
a possible loss of highway funds for states that fail to revoke
driver's licenses from those convicted of drug offenses.
   The draft also threatens to drop federal education funds from
elementary, secondary and post-secondary schools that fail to have
Education Department-checked and approved drug-prevention programs
and policies. Threats in an earlier draft to revoke criminal
justice funds were eliminated from the later draft.

<HEAD>Army to Reopen Schools for 70,000 More Children</HEAD>

   Junior high schools in the occupied West Bank
will be reopened Wednesday, allowing about 70,000 more Palestinian
children to return to classes, the Israeli army announced Tuesday.
   The junior high schools would be reopened for the first time
since January, said West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amiram Mitzna.
   Primary schools and classes for high school seniors reopened
July 22, and 200,000 students returned to classes.
   The West Bank's nearly 1,200 primary and secondary schools were
closed throughout most of the 19-month Palestinian uprising against
Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   The Israeli government said the schools were hotbeds of violence
and rejected repeated appeals from the United States and
international human rights organizations against the closures.
   Palestinian leaders have called on students not to jeopardize
the resumption of classes by initiating anti-Israeli disturbances.
   Mitzna, speaking to Israeli legislators touring the West Bank
town of Ramallah, said the army was considering reopening classes
for high school sophomores and juniors in the near future, Israel
radio said.
   Mitzna added that Israel recently released 97 high school
students who were arrested for anti-Israeli protests to allow them
to resume their education.
   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, two Palestinians were shot and
wounded overnight in clashes between Israeli soldiers and about 200
protesters in the Tulkarem refugee camp. The army also fired tear
gas to disperse the crowd, which gathered to protest the death of a
Palestinian camp resident earlier in the week, Arab reports said.
   The army said three Palestinians were wounded in the Tulkaram
clashes.
   In other developments, Israel radio reported that leaflets
signed by Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat's Fatah wing warned activists from the hard-line Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine that ``they bear
responsibility'' for their threats against Palestinian lawyer Jamil
Tarifi.
   Tarifi, a PLO supporter, disclosed last week he had met with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for discussions on
implementing Shamir's peace plan. Tarifi is the only Palestinian to
admit to such a meeting.
   Graffiti signed by the front later appeared on walls threatening
Tarifi with punishment for the meeting.
   Faisal Husseini, a prominent east Jerusalem Palestinian leader
and a PLO supporter, harshly criticized the threats and told the
Israeli news agency Itim that ``these warnings do not serve the
Palestinian cause.''
   The front, headed by George Habash, has opposed Arafat's offer
to compromise in negotiations with Israel.

   During the tough teen-age years, kids often reach
out for help, but police say some of those who call telephone talk
lines become victims of criminals capitalizing on their
vulnerability.
   Since the expensive ``chat lines'' began about two years ago,
parents have battled their children over spiraling phone bills. But
now three Massachusetts men face charges of raping a 14-year-old
Hopedale girl they enticed to run away from home and people are
wondering if a more serious threat may be afoot.
   ``We have a lot of troubled teens and it's discouraging,'' said
Nancy Arguello, a manager at a local talk line company. ``If a guy
is smart enough to get a girl to believe he's nice, there's not
much we can do. Some of them can be very clever and unfortunately
girls fall into the trap.''
   ``It's a big problem and getting bigger,'' said Patrolman
Richard Mank, who has managed the Hopedale case and spoken with
other police departments about similar incidents.
   The trio has allegedly made contact with at least eight
teen-agers in recent months, Mank said, offering them reassurance
and a safe place to go should the teens want to run away from home.
   ``Sick people are using these kids. They make friends with them
and listen for the ones who want to run away,'' he said. ``I would
caution the parents to listen to their kids so they don't go to
strangers.''
   Of 40 million party line calls logged by New England Telephone
over a 2{-year period, at least 10 percent were made by those who
dial services like XBT Telecom's ``Talkabout'' teen line, a group
conversation designed for people under age 16, said John Johnson, a
spokesman for the telephone company.
   ``Talkabout is an entertainment service. It is not and never has
been designed or advertised as a threatening or abusive type of
thing,'' said XBT spokesman Allan Fitzmaurice.
   Moderators are required to keep conversations from getting too
personal and disconnect abusive callers, said Bernice McIntyre,
chairman of the Public Utilities Commission.
   But no federal guidelines have been set down and the degree to
which moderators enforce talk line standards can vary.
   Arguello, who trains and manages moderators for XBT, said
regardless of how well prepared mediators are, party lines can get
out of control.
   ``Everyone picks up the phone at night and goes crazy for some
reason,'' Arguello said. ``All the creeps come out of the woodwork.
You disconnect them and they keep coming back, even angrier than
before.''
   Moderators often listen in on 20 to 30 lines at a time, she
said, making it impossible to keep tabs on all the conversations.
   ``It's been our policy to discourage callers from meeting and
exchanging phone numbers and we cut people off all the time,''
Fitzmaurice said.
   Apparently in the case of the 14-year-old in Hopedale, three
men, all over the age of 16, allegedly wooed her without
discouragement.
   Two men were arrested and arraigned late last month on various
charges, including rape, kidnapping, contributing to delinquency
and abusing a child under 16 years old. An arrest warrant has been
issued for a third man wanted on similar charges.

   Here is a brief look at wildfires burning Tuesday in the West:
   Idaho: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have burned 76,000
acres, much of that on national forest land in the western and
central parts of the state. Flames were near three small mountain
towns Tuesday, and 5,000 firefighters were on the fire lines.
   Montana: A fire burning in grassland and scattered timber in the
Custer National Forest became the state's biggest fire of the
summer Tuesday when it surpassed 1,200 acres. About 140
firefighters were dispatched to fight the blaze in the southeast
corner of the state, and several smaller blazes burned elsewhere.
   Oregon: Fires east of the Cascade Mountains have burned 80,000
acres, and were being fought Tuesday by 5,000 people. The worst of
the blazes were around Baker, where ranchers were forced from their
remote homes over the weekend, but allowed to return Monday and
Tuesday.
   Washington: About 110 firefighters cut a containment line most
of the way around an 850-acre forest fire in the Pasayten
Wilderness near the Canadian border Tuesday. About 1,200 Army
troops at Fort Lewis began a crash course in firefighting and fire
safty techniques so they could join the battle against wildfires in
Oregon.

<HEAD>Churches Endorse Defiance Campaign, Fear a Police Crackdown</HEAD>

   Church leaders Tuesday
endorsed a campaign of mass defiance scheduled to start this week,
but they said they feared the government would respond with a harsh
crackdown.
   The South African Council of Churches, which includes almost all
leading Protestant denominations, said it backed a plan for ailing
blacks to seek treatment at ``whites only'' hospitals beginning
Wednesday.
   The civil disobedience campaign is expected to include other
tactics and to intensify in the days leading up to the segregated
parliamentary elections Sept. 6. South Africa's tricameral
Parliament has houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race,
but excludes the 28 million black majority.
   ``Elections in South Africa have become synonymous with the
perpetuation of apartheid and discrimination,'' said Frank Chikane,
general secretary of the council of churches.
   ``The only means that remain open to the voteless majority is to
embark on a program of peaceful, non-violent defiance that will
change these laws,'' Chikane said.
   His statement was endorsed by nine prominent church officials,
including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``We call on all participants ... to act with discipline and
restraint that such a campaign deserves in order to retain the
moral high ground,'' Chikane said.
   ``We are seriously concerned at the repressive action which (Law
and Order Minister Adriaan) Vlok has threatened to use,'' he said.
   Vlok has said the campaign is part of an attempt to disrupt the
elections with violence. Such actions, he said, must be stopped
``at all costs.''
   There have been several bombings in the past week, and police
said the three people who were killed had been planting the
explosives. On Monday night, gunmen opened fire and tossed a hand
grenade at a Johannesburg police station, but no one was injured.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the violence. Police blame
most such attacks on the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla group.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, a loose coalition of
anti-apartheid groups that organized the defiance campaign, said
anti-black leaflets that had been circulating in recent days
``could be the work of the government so as to instill a climate of
violence around a non-violent action.''
   One organizer, Cas Coovadia, said no more than 50 blacks were
expected to present themselves Wednesday at any one of the eight
white hospitals targeted by the movement. Government officials have
said blacks who arrive at ``whites only'' hospitals and are not in
need of emergency treatment will be referred to ``black'' hospitals.
   People entering hospitals without permission could face jail
terms of up to two years, according to a government directive
issued last week.
   The Mass Democratic Movement has no official structure or
acknowledged leader, but is made up of some of the same people who
headed the United Democratic Front until it was banned last year.

   Some people fled and spent the night
in cars or in a shelter, and some stayed home and awoke to find
water in their homes when Hurricane Chantal swept ashore Tuesday
morning.
   ``I stepped out of my bed into standing water,'' said Helen
Church, who was taken from her beachfront home to a shelter set up
at the High Island High School. ``It was the first time that had
ever happened to me. I called in and asked if anybody was being
evacuated and they offered to come and get me.''
   Chantal, packing wind up to 80 mph, came ashore over High Island
about 8 a.m. Tuesday before weakening and being downgraded to a
tropical storm late in the morning.
   Doug Considine, with the Galveston County Sheriff's Department
Beach Patrol, said roads in the area were passable although debris
was scattered across several sections where water topped the
highway.
   John Richardson and Peggy Howard spent the night in his car
after fleeing from their Gilcrest home.
   ``I don't know if there's anything left there to get back to but
I'm sure ready to find out,'' Richardson said.
   Bucky Faggard, 48, knew from the hurricane's strength that it
would not be too threatening.
   ``You go through so many of them that you learn not to start
worrying too much with the winds like this. When they get up to
175, 200 (mph), that's when I start worrying about it,'' Faggard
said.
   Faggard said he stayed when Hurricane Carla blew through in 1961
and caused a great deal of damage.
   ``With Carla in '61, we were completed surrounded by water and
were isolated for about five days, but I don't expect anything like
that from this. We've been through a bunch of these and you don't
ever really know what's going to happen so we always prepare,'' he
said.
   George E. Kahla relaxed in an old easy chair inside his
self-proclaimed trading post, emblazoned with a sign ``We buy and
sell good junk.''
   ``I'm going to sit here and play it cool and not get too excited
about all this,'' he said.
   ``That's the beauty of this business. If it blows over, you just
pick it back up later. You can't tell much difference.''

<HEAD>Bush Faces Dilemma in Dealing with Developments in Beirut</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With one American hostage reported dead and
another under threat, President Bush is grappling with the same
dilemma that haunted his predecessors: how to punish international
terrorists without jeopardizing the lives of innocent people.
   Administrations back to President Nixon's for the most part have
shied away from military retaliation when faced with terrorist
activity, even when the provocation was great. Now Bush is the one
facing decisions after Monday's reported execution of Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   A 1986 report on terrorism written by a task force headed by
then Vice President Bush summed up the difficulty: ``Our principles
of justice will not permit random retaliation against groups or
countries.''
   The report also acknowledged that counter-terrorism operations
are high risk missions that ``can have a severe negative impact on
U.S. prestige if they fail.''
   Put another way, Bush is loath to order the dropping of
500-pound bombs if, in addition to doing away with enemy targets,
the action also claims the lives of innocent civilians and
jeopardizes the remaining American hostages as well. Americans
traveling in the Middle East could become even more inviting
targets to terrorists intent on vengeance.
   Compounding Bush's problem is that solid intelligence from
Beirut's shadowy underworld is hard to come by. The American
hostages are believed to be never in the same place at the same
time so a rescue mission is regarded as extremely difficult if not
futile.
   The administration has begun pursuing a diplomatic option for
dealing with the terrorism issue but officials acknowledged Tuesday
that this is a painstakingly slow process with little prospect of
quick results.
   After conferring in Paris in recent days with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was
in Tehran Tuesday relaying American concerns about the unfolding
drama in Beirut, according to the officials.
   Beyond that, U.S. diplomats were in contact with a number of
governments thought to be in a position to influence the Iranians,
who have close links to the Lebanese Shiite group which claimed
responsibility for Higgins' reported death.
   Bush's decision to cut short his out of town schedule on Monday
and return to Washington raised the expectation that more dramatic
measures were in the offing to register his horror over Monday's
developments.
   On the other hand, the almost unanimous opinion of private
experts is that Bush's hands are tied.
   ``Rhetoric is cheap, but decisive action is difficult. I don't
know if there is very much we can do in the short term,'' said
Geoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan administration official who works
for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   There are other inhibitions to a strong show of U.S. force. In
the post-Khomeini era in Tehran, a bloody retaliatory raid could
squander whatever prospects there are for an improvement in
relations with Iran.
   The sense of anxiety here has been heightened with the threat
that another American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, will be killed
Thursday if Israel does not release a kidnapped Shiite cleric.
   No president was more disposed toward dealing decisively with
terrorists than Ronald Reagan, who took office pledging ``swift and
effective retribution'' against them.
   But Reagan stopped short of carrying out that promise even in
the face of his darkest moment as president: the truck bombing
deaths of 241 American Marines in Beirut in October 1983.
   Public demands for retaliatory action quickly dissipated when
American attention was diverted by the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada
barely two days later.
   In addition, Reagan felt that the options presented to him for
retaliating for the deaths of the Marines were too costly.
   Reagan did respond with a determined show of force 2{ years
later after he concluded that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was
behind the bombing of a cafe in West Germany frequented by American
soldiers.
   American F-111 bombers based in Britain struck at targets in
Tripoli and Benghazi, and administration officials said Gadhafi was
far less adventuresome afterward.
   While the link between Gadhafi and the cafe bombing appeared to
be clear, at least to the administration, the connection between
Iran and the Shiite Moslem group which announced the execution of
Higgins on Monday was more ambiguous.

<HEAD>Industries `Hold Nose' But Support Bush Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major industries acknowledged
Tuesday their lobbyists lined up congressional sponsors for
President Bush's clean air bill, even though business rejects key
language to control acid rain and car pollution.
   Reflecting an ambivalent attitude toward one of the president's
major legislative initiatives, the multi-industry Clean Air Working
Group objected strongly to Bush's planned alternative fuels program
for motor vehicles, and a ``cap'' on utilities' sulfur dioxide
emissions, the major cause of acid rain.
   Despite these reservations, the coalition of major petroleum,
oil, auto, chemical, utility and other companies said Bush's
legislation remains the best hope for breaking a decade-long
stalemate on improving the nation's air pollution law.
   ``It is tough to get co-sponsors on a bill we don't support,''
coalition administrator William Fay, told a news conference. ``We
did hold our nose.''
   By supporting the Bush legislation, industry is trying to steer
lawmakers away from rival bills supported by environmental groups,
who argue the Bush proposal is loaded with concessions for
industry. The competing legislation would give industry far fewer
choices than the Bush plan in deciding how to curb air pollution,
which Fay said is not as bad as some people think.
   ``The air in every city but Los Angeles is healthy 99 percent of
the time,'' he declared.
   Besides giving industry's most comprehensive assessment of the
Bush legislation so far, Fay accused rival environmental groups of
using a ``rhetorical slight of hand ... to argue the bill is soft.
There's no gift here, for consumers, workers or businesses.''
   Describing intensive industry lobbying to line up sponsors for
the Bush legislation, one House staffer said she was visited by a
General Motors lobbyist even though her boss has announced support
for the rival legislation.
   According to the staffer, the lobbyist argued that automakers
``were being unjustly accused'' of causing the nation's air
pollution problems even though vehicle pollution has been largely
controlled by new technology.
   The Bush legislation was introduced in the House with 90
Republican and 57 Democratic sponsors, and was to be introduced in
the Senate this week.
   The provisions that upset the industry group the most have been
cited again and again by administration officials as cornerstones
of the legislation.
   The alternative fuels plan would require that in areas with
severe ozone pollution _ at least nine cities _ vehicles with
clean-burning fuel must be sold according to the following
schedule: 500,000 in the 1995 model year; 750,000 in the 1996 model
year; and one million in each of the model years from 1997 through
2004. Those figures represent only a percentage of the total number
of vehicles expected to be sold in those cities each year.
   The Bush plan also would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10
million tons by the end of the year 2000, based on 1980 levels. But
the measure also would ``cap'' emissions at the reduced level, thus
restricting growth of utilities unless they could further reduce
their emissions from existing plants.
   Speaking of the alternative fuels plan, Fay said, ``We're
suggesting the mandate should not be there'' because automakers are
not certain the technology is perfected for such a program.
   The leading alternative fuel is methanol, currently made from
natural gas but which also can be manufactured from coal. The
industry group said methanol would be the most likely alternative
fuel if the Bush program went into effect.
   Michael Mason, a lobbyist with the American Petroleum Institute,
told the news conference that his oil industry trade group believes
the proposal to be ``a big mistake'' because ``there should be a
level playing field in which all fuels should be able to compete.''
   Mason said most methanol would have to come from Saudi Arabia,
Iran or the Soviet Union, and suggested that oil companies may be
able to produce a cleaner-burning gasoline as an alternative.
   The cap on sulfur dioxide emissions, Fay said, ``is
unnecessarily restrictive, limits economic growth, and makes it
difficult to build new factories and power plants.''

<HEAD>Woman Said to Drink Own Urine While Stranded on Life Raft</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Contents of 5th graf, ``Dr. Goran ...'' may be offensive to

<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who survived for two weeks in
the North Atlantic was so busy eating a fish that had jumped into
her life raft that she almost failed to see the vessel that rescued
her, a doctor said Tuesday.
   Janet Culver, a legal secretary from Passaic, N.J., was rescued
Sunday by a U.S. research vessel. Her ordeal began July 16 when she
was stranded on the open life raft with her boyfriend, Nicholas
Abbott, after their yacht sank two days into a trip from Bermuda to
Greenpoint, N.Y.
   Abbott, 50, jumped from the raft 10 days later, and he is
believed to have drowned, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
   Ms. Culver, 48, was in stable condition Tuesday at Hamilton's
King Edward VII Memorial Hospital.
   Dr. Goran Akerberg said in an interview that Ms. Culver survived
by drinking her own urine for four or five days before being
rescued. He said he had been worried about the amount of salt she
had taken in through the urine.
   The doctor said Ms. Culver was calm and alert when she was
transferred to the Bermuda-bound Royal Viking Star cruise ship, a
Swedish vessel, on Sunday about 350 miles northwest of this British
colony.
   Akerberg, the Royal Viking's doctor who treated Ms. Culver, was
quoting by Bermuda's Royal Gazette newspaper as saying she is ``a
very strong-willed person who wanted to survive.''
   ``She told me she was very energetic right up until the last few
days, but then she was sleeping more and more,'' he said in the
newspaper interview.
   Ms. Culver earlier told officials she and Abbott were trapped on
the 3-foot-by-10-foot raft with only a flashlight, a flotation
device, an FM radio, some cold cuts, crackers, peanuts, and a half
gallon of water.
   Akerberg also said the couple later managed to collect a
half-gallon of water during a downpour.
   The doctor said that after a while, ``she noticed her
boyfriend's personality begin to change: he didn't want to go on.
He jumped over the side of the raft. She just thought he was
cooling off, but he swam away and disappeared.''
   Abbott, a delivery man for a Bogota, N.J., courier service,
lived on a boat during the summer in New York.
   The doctor was quoted as saying Ms. Culver had been dieting for
several weeks before the trip. ``That could have helped save her
life,'' he said. ``She was already eating less.''
   He said she was severely dehydrated, undernourished, and
suffering from exposure when she was rescued.
   The Coast Guard said they had abandoned ship after a leak
developed in packing material around the propeller shaft. They put
the engine in neutral to recharge batteries, but it slipped back
into gear and blew out the packing material, letting in water.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Dr. Ronald Lightbourne, the
medical director at the hospital, said Ms. Culver was progressing
well and had eaten ham and eggs for breakfast. He said she was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Monday evening ``more to
protect her from the attention of the media than as a result of her
medical condition.''
   She will undergo minor surgery Wednesday to remove patches of
sunburned skin and will be hospitalized a few more days, he said.

   The United States on Tuesday pledged
$50 million in additional food aid to Poland to help ease shortages
caused by the government's moves toward a free-market economy.
   ``We're trying to help carry them through this period,'' Curtis
Kamman, deputy assistant U.S. secretary of state for European
affairs, said at the end of a 24-nation meeting on economic aid to
Poland and Hungary.
   Austria and Switzerland also promised food aid. The European
Economic Community, a 12-nation trading bloc, earlier agreed to
remove $120 million worth of meat, grains and other products from
warehouses to ship to Poland.
   Western nations want to speed up the push in Eastern Europe for
more open political and market-oriented economic systems.
   Poland on Tuesday ended price controls and meat rationing as
part of the government's drive toward a free-market economy. There
was concern the abrupt lifting of price controls might send the
country into turmoil.
   President Bush and other world leaders last month asked the
European Economic Community to set up an aid meeting to try to
encourage democratic change and economic reforms in Poland and
Hungary. The leaders, attending their annual economic summit in
Paris, also urged emergency food shipments to Poland.
   Shortly after Bush's trip to Poland last month, the United
States promised $9 million in food from surplus stocks.
   Kamman called Tuesday's conference ``very successful.''
Participants agreed to meet again in the early fall for more
discussions and decide then whether to schedule a high-level
conference on the aid program.
   Kamman told reporters it was the ``intention of the United
States'' to provide an additional $50 million in surplus food to
Poland beginning Oct. 1. Most will be free; some might be sold on
easy loan terms.
   ``It gives them the confidence to do their price reform, and it
may help them in the long-run to keep social discontent at a
manageable level,'' Kamman said.
   EEC spokesmen said the conference's agenda focused on food aid
to Poland and economic and trade cooperation between the West and
the Poland and Hungary..
   They said Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski sent a letter
last month asking for 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered milk,
butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the next few months.
   He also said Poland needed at least 3.7 million tons of food
next year and again in 1991, roughly $1 billion worth in each year,
according to the EEC. Moreover, he asked for 250,000 tons of feed
for animals and $220 million to $250 million in pesticides and
similar products in 1990 and again in 1991.
   The spokesmen said there was interest in devising a plan to link
the free food to changes in the structure of the Polish economy,
particularly in the poorly working system for getting food from
farms to consumers' tables. Poland has accepted the idea in
principle, they said.
   One possibility, under discussion by the Common Market, would be
to allow the Poles to sell the food on the free market and use the
money to improve the distribution chain.
   The spokesmen said the quick shipments of food were necessary to
help Poland as it goes through the painful process of restructuring
its economy. Some at the conference urged that the food be
channeled into the economy so that it doesn't worsen the
already-high inflation rate or discourage domestic food production.
   Hungary has been in the forefront of economic reforms in the
East bloc since the 1960s. Still, it has a foreign debt of about
$18 billion, the highest per capita in Eastern Europe. Poland's
foreign debt stands at $39 billion.
   Nations at meeting include the Common Market members of Britain,
Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Also present were the
United States, Canada, Australia, Turkey, New Zealand, Japan,
Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, Norway and Iceland.

<HEAD>Soldiers Celebrate Birthday of Red Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers frolicked in an amusement park Tuesday
to celebrate the 62nd birthday of China's army, and thousands of
civilians flocked to an exhibit about the pro-democracy student
movement that was crushed by troops.
   Despite weeks of buildup in the media, however, there was little
other public observation of Army Day, which marks its founding on
Aug. 1, 1927.
   Also Tuesday, China's official Xinhua News Agency criticized as
traitors fugitive Chinese dissidents who have formed groups in the
United States to work for democratic reform at home.
   It also criticized foreign news reports on the dissidents'
activities, especially those of the U.S. government-run Voice of
America.
   The nationally televised evening news reported only two brief
ceremonies at Tiananmen Square, which student protesters occupied
for seven weeks until the military crackdown June 3-4 that left
hundreds, perhaps thousands of people dead.
   The square has been closed to the general public since then, and
city officials had suggested it would be filled with soldiers
Tuesday.
   Instead, one of the few places that drew a crowd was the
Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, which on Monday
formally opened an exhibit on the popular student movement.
   Nearly 6,000 people visited the museum in just three hours
Tuesday, compared to 3,000 to 4,000 visitors on an average day,
museum employees said. Many were there to see the exhibit which,
like all official accounts of what the government calls a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion,'' criticizes the students and
glorifies the army.
   Crowds gathered four or five deep in front of the displays about
the student movement, and those who managed to squeeze toward the
front bent over glass cases, poring over the students' petitions,
handbills and big-character posters calling for democracy, human
rights and more freedoms.
   The exhibit also showed rows of battered army helmets, mangled
rifles with broken butts, and blood-soaked army uniforms _ evidence
of the soldiers' patience and restraint, the signs said.
   But few people lingered long in front of the displays that
lauded the army and praised the party.
   For weeks, the leadership and the media have been exhorting the
masses to make this year's Army Day particularly memorable in a
show of love and respect for the army, but most of the holiday
activities were restricted to the troops.
   The Beijing evening TV news showed soldiers gleefully driving
bumper cars and sliding down water rides at an amusement park.
   At dawn in Tiananmen Square, a group of Young Pioneers, the
Communist Party's organization for youngsters, attended the daily
flag-raising. The nationally televised evening news said the
children were told ``to learn from their martial law
soldier-uncles.''
   A few hours later, several hundred soldiers attended an award
ceremony to honor those who acted bravely during the turmoil, but
the square was empty again after 20 minutes.
   The soldiers stood facing a single red banner while a band
played the national anthem. Some soldiers were shown receiving
medals.
   The biggest commemoration came in the nation's newspapers,
almost all of which carried front-page editorials praising the army.
   ``Officers and soldiers have stood up to all tests and used
their blood and lives to protect ... the party ... and the people's
power and safety,'' the People's Daily said.
   Xinhua called the Voice of America ``the most active and open
supporter of the fugitives in their attempt to overthrow the
Chinese government.''
   ``Not long ago VOA broadcast twice its long interview with Wu'er
Kaixi, continuing to spread the lie of the `bloodletting at
Tiananmen Square.'''
   Wu'er was one of the leaders of the seven-week student
pro-democracy movement that shook China in the spring. He vowed
after fleeing China to continue fighting to avenge the hundreds and
possibly thousands of people who died when the army attacked the
protesters June 3-4.
   He and other fugitive dissidents helped lead a gathering in
Chicago last week of Chinese studying in the United States, at
which participants voted to form an All-America Chinese Student
Union to press for reform in China.
   Xinhua accused the students of accepting financial help from the
rival Nationalist government on Taiwan.

<HEAD>Study Says Cuts in Housing Program Leave Waiting List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuts during recent years in a federal program
that provides housing for the elderly and handicapped left a long
waiting list of applicants for available units, according to an
American Association of Retired Persons study released Tuesday.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development scaled back the
so-called Section 202 construction during the Reagan administration
and scrapped elevators for two-story buildings housing frail
residents, the study said.
   Although AARP cited the program as ``a model of successful
cooperation between the federal government and private, non-profit
sponsors,'' it said it found newer units inadequately adapted for
residents whose mobility decreases with age.
   ``Over half of the projects occupied during the most recent
phase of the program were forced by HUD to change their
construction plans to eliminate congregate spaces or elevators, to
use lower quality construction materials or to build smaller
units,'' said John Rother, AARP's director of legislation, research
and public policy.
   ``This raises questions about the ability of these projects to
remain sound and able to adapt to the residents' needs, 80 percent
of whom are elderly women,'' he added.
   AARP said that HUD since 1959 has provided direct low-interest
loans to non-profit sponsors to encourage construction of
subsidized rental housing for older adults and the disabled. It
added that nearly 200,000 units have been built since the program
began but new construction has decreased from 20,000 units in the
1970s to 10,000 units last year.
   It said waiting lists averaged eight people for every vacancy in
buildings constructed with Section 202 funds.
   The organization advocates a larger Section 202 construction
program to keep the elderly and handicapped out of more expensive
institutional care.
   AARP, a non-partisan organization representing people age 50 and
older, said surveys were mailed to all the Section 202 housing
project managers and sponsors in 1988, of whom about 60 percent
responded.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., chairman of the subcommittee on
housing and consumer interests of the House Select Committee on
Aging, released the study conducted by the University of Illinois,
and called it a useful tool to motivate Congress on housing
legislation.
   ``Needless to say, the current crises at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development have taught us that better monitoring
of program administration and effectiveness is severely needed,''
he said.
   Florio said that if the federal government does not authorize
additional construction, ``low-income older adults will not live
long enough to move from the waiting lists into 202 units.''

   Robin Higgins called on her husband's captors
Tuesday to ``give us proof'' of whether he is dead or alive.
   Mrs. Higgins, who remained out of the public eye for most of the
day at the Pentagon, said through a spokeswoman that she had viewed
the videotape of the purported execution of her husband, Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   However, she said, ``It is impossible to make a definite
determination on whether my husband is dead or alive.''
   Pentagon spokeswoman Army Maj. Kathy Wood relayed the comments
from Mrs. Higgins.
   ``I want my husband returned home,'' Mrs. Higgins was quoted as
saying.
   She also called on his captors to ``give us proof of his
condition,'' Ms. Wood said.
   Mrs. Higgins is a major in the Marine Corps and works as a
Defense Department public information officer.
   She was officially on leave Tuesday but came to the Pentagon to
be kept informed about her husband's fate, her colleague said.
   Mrs. Higgins appeared grim-faced as reporters and photographers
observed her leave the Pentagon for Capitol Hill to meet Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. The senator had requested the
meeting, Ms. Wood said.
   Mrs. Higgins, attired in her Marine uniform and accompanied by
her lawyer Gregory Craig, was silent and did not acknowledge the
journalists as she entered her vehicle.
   Higgins was serving in a United Nations peacekeeping unit when
he was kidnapped in south Lebanon in February 1988. A U.N.
spokeswoman said Tuesday that Marrack Goulding, the
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping, was going to
Beirut to gather information and to try to retrieve the officer's
body.
   A videotape released Monday by Higgins' Shiite Moslem kidnappers
showed a person hanging, bound and gagged. A statement released by
the shadowy group, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, said
Higgins was hanged after their deadline had passed for the release
of Abdul Karim Obeid, who was captured by Israeli commandos in
southern Lebanon.
   On Monday, Pentagon officials delivered a copy of the videotape
to Mrs. Higgins at home.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said analysts were trying ``to
find out whether the picture on the tape is in fact Lt. Col.
Higgins.''
   The spokesman also relayed a statement from Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, who said, ``The apparent murder of Lt. Col. Rich
Higgins is a brutal and despicable act. It deserves universal
condemnation by civilized people all over the world.''
   He added, however, there is ``no independent confirmation'' of
the reports of Higgins' execution.
   However, several Pentagon officials interviewed privately said
they were acting on the assumption that the tape did show Higgins.
   ``Quite a few of us believe he's gone,'' said one official, who
spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   The official said Mrs. Higgins has been ``holding up well. She's
a very strong person.''

   Japan on Tuesday donated $2.5 million to a
new U.N. fund to pay for the start-up costs of peacekeeping
missions, officials said.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said the money would be put into a
trust fund to help pay for short-term financing to implement new
peacekeeping missions.
   The world body assesses its members for the cost of
peacekeeping, but often must dip into its operating funds to pay
for start-up costs until member-states pay their assessments.

<HEAD>Americans Aren't Saving Enough, Federal Reserve Chairman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
calling the low U.S. savings rate one of the most critical problems
facing the country, said Tuesday that the Bush administration is
drawing up legislative proposals to encourage Americans to be more
thrifty.
   The low rate of savings in the United States compared to other
industrial countries has been a major source of concern for
policymakers trying to make American businesses more competitive
internationally.
   Personal savings, as a percentage of disposable income, fell to
a record low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and recovered only slightly to
4.2 percent in 1988.
   The Fed chairman said that between the Civil War and World War
I, the United States had the highest savings rate in the world, a
position now held by Japan. Policymakers are concerned because a
low pool of savings drives up the cost of borrowing for businesses,
making it more expensive for them to expand and modernize their
production facilities.
   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee,
called the low U.S. savings rate ``the crucial issue for the
long-term economic outlook of the country.''
   He said officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury
Department and the president's Council of Economic Advisers were
studying a variety of possible legislative proposals to boost
savings.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber said in an interview
that the administration had a task force reviewing the low savings
question. Glauber said one option being considered was revamping
Individual Retirement Accounts, which were scaled back in the 1986
tax law.
   Also being studied, Glauber said, were ways to eliminate the
inequity in the tax code that corporations face between borrowing
to finance expansion and selling more equity in their concerns. If
a corporation raises capital by borrowing, it can deduct its
interest payments. But if it sells stock in the company and
distributes dividends on its profits, both it and its shareholders
are taxed on those profits.
   Glauber said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady would be
addressing the country's inadequate savings rate during a series of
speeches this fall. The administration's push for a reduction in
the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changes
needed to lower the cost of capital to businesses, Glauber said.
   ``These are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly,''
Glauber said.
   One problem the administration faces in proposing any changes in
the tax law is that creating tax breaks to encourage savings, such
as restoring the full deductability of IRA contributions, would
cost the government billions of dollars at a time of high budget
deficits.
   Greenspan said America's low savings rates were a ``very
difficult problem, one that has exasperated economists for a number
of years.''
   On other subjects, Greenspan:
   _Confirmed that the central bank moved to lower interest rates
for a third time last week as part of its continuing effort to keep
the country out of a recession.
   _Predicted that the U.S. trade deficit would show little further
improvement this year because increases in the dollar would hurt
American exports. But Greenspan said he believed the trade deficit
would resume dropping significantly beginning next year.
   _Backed the administration's position that the huge bailout of
the savings and loan industry should be handled ``off-budget.''
This approach, because it would be harder to duplicate, would not
encourage other efforts to circumvent the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law requiring a balanced federal budget by 1993,
Greenspan said.
   _Rejected suggestions that the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets,
which call for reducing the shortfall to $64 billion in 1991 and
$28 billion in 1992, should be raised, saying any such tinkering
would roil financial markets.
   Greenspan's comments on the deficit targets came in response to
a question from Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   Sasser later told reporters that he opposed changing the
Gramm-Rudman targets but that the idea was being floated by other
lawmakers who wanted to avoid the pain of making sharp cuts in the
federal budget next year, right before the mid-term congressional
elections.
   He said the suggestion was being made in connection with
proposals to remove certain big government programs, such as Social
Security and highway construction, from the main federal budget.

   Sinkholes from an abandoned coal mine
are threatening to gobble up a school playground, officials said.
   ``It's something really serious,'' said Pittsburg County
Conservation District Manager Kevin Smith. ``Something needs to be
done quickly.''
   School starts in two weeks.
   ``It makes you feel like the world's caving in on you,'' said
Haileyville Superintendent Gary Newberry.
   Maintenance worker Bobby Morrow found the new hole, 30 feet from
the children's swings, on Thursday.
   ``I was replacing a board on the merry-go-round. I walked
through a gate and almost fell in it,'' Morrow said.
   The hole is about five feet across and is four or five feet
deep, Newberry said. ``If a small child fell in the hole, they
wouldn't be able to get out.''
   Officials covered the hole with plywood and put a fence around
it.
   Another sinkhole on the school grounds is filled several times a
year, but continues to collapse, Newberry said.
   Officials also plan to test the school grounds to find out
whether there are more cavities under the surface. The ground has
collapsed into abandoned mines at several nearby locations in
recent months.

   The parents of two young people who
disappeared last year in New Mexico said Tuesday that a mysterious
photograph found in a Florida parking lot appears to show their
children, bound and gagged.
   Michael Henley, now 10, vanished on a turkey hunt with his
father in April 1988 in the mountains south of their hometown of
Milan, N.M. Tara Calico, now 20, disappeared five months later
while bicycling on a country road near her hometown of Belen, N.M.
   Michael's parents and Ms. Calico's mother flew to this Florida
Panhandle city to meet with police Tuesday. The mystery photo was
found June 15 in a store lot where a white van had been parked, but
the parents did not learn about it until the picture was shown
Friday on the nationally syndicated television show ``A Current
Affair.''
   After spending two hours viewing the photo and talking with
investigators, Michael's mother, Marty Henley, said she is almost
certain the boy shown tied up in the Polaroid snapshot is her son.
   ``He looks scared, real scared, but he looks healthy and I'm
grateful for that,'' Mrs. Henley said, but added, ``I don't want to
get my hopes up too high.''
   Her husband, also named Michael, was more cautious, saying he
wanted FBI experts to compare photos, but agreed the resemblance
was striking.
   ``If it's not Michael, it's a little boy who looks very much
like Michael,'' Henley said.
   The mother of Ms. Calico, Pat Doel, said she was convinced the
young woman shown in the photo was her daughter.
   She said she was relieved her daughter appeared to be healthy,
and said she wanted that message to get through to the abductor.
   ``Strange as it may seem, I would thank him for keeping her
alive,'' Ms. Doel said. ``I would thank him for taking care of her,
seeing that she's fed, seeing that she's clean. I hope he values
her life as much as we do.''
   The parents said they were frustrated that the photo _ which
could have been taken as early as April, according to police
experts _ was not enough to locate the children.
   ``It's frustrating for us to think perhaps we've got this close
and can't go any further,'' Ms. Doel said.
   Port St. Joe Police Chief Carl Richter said the FBI has agreed
to use other photographs of the children and compare them with the
photo in its Washington laboratory to confirm the identifications.
He said that police also had received dozens of other tips, but the
Henley and Calico cases were considered the only serious ones.
   He said the parents and investigators, while pleased to find the
photo, were worried about the consequences of the discovery.
   ``It could be devastating,'' Richter said. ``Whoever has the
children, if he hears about it, they may retaliate _ it's a
possibility.''
   The FBI in Albuquerque has said it is already providing
technical help to local authorities, and that as soon as an
abduction is confirmed, the agency will officially enter the case.
   The parents said they did not know when they would return to New
Mexico.
   They were alerted to the picture by friends who saw ``A Current
Affair,'' and they appeared on the show Monday. At first they were
unsure about the identifications, but Ms. Doel said that after
taking time, growth and lack of makeup into consideration, she was
convinced the girl was her daughter.
   Ms. Calico is shown in the photo beside the book ``My Secret
Audrina'' by V.C. Andrews, which the mother identified as her
daughter's favorite.

<HEAD>Ronald Spiers Replaces Joseph Reed As Top U.S. Official at U.N.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat,
will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly
affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N.
officials said Tuesday.
   Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as
ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
   He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post
from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for
the United States.
   Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for
Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had
been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday.
   Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently
serving as undersecretary of state for management since 1983.
   Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United
Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs
for the State Department.
   From 1966-69, Spiers was counselor for political affairs in the
U.S. Embassy in London.
   In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the
department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
   When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers
became the first U.S. ambassador to that nation.
   He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister
of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed
ambassador to Turkey.
   In 1980 he returned to the State Department as director of
Intelligence and Research, and was appointed ambassador to Pakistan
in 1981.

   A swarm of bees stung a woman to death
after she apparently knocked over the hive.
   Mary Gaxiola, 66, was stung Monday more than 100 times,
including about 50 times on her head and face, said Coroner David
M. Hadden.
   Other workers in a cantaloupe field 200 miles north of Los
Angeles put towels on the victim. A Highway Patrol helicopter crew
administered anti-sting drugs before flying her to a hospital,
where she was pronounced dead.
   Hadden said people allergic to bee stings can die from the venom
in a single sting, while multiple stings can be fatal to others
through a buildup of venom.
   The coroner said bees in the area would be sent to the state for
examination but did not appear to be the aggressive Africanized or
killer bees that were found 100 miles away four years ago and
supposedly eradicated.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-member jury Tuesday began deliberating
whether Korean Air Lines was guilty of willful misconduct when one
of its jumbo jets flew off course and was shot down by a Soviet
fighter plane in 1983, killing all 269 people aboard.
   In final arguments after a two-week trial in U.S. District
Court, lawyers for families of the victims said Flight 007 was off
course almost from the minute it left the ground in Anchorage,
Alaska, and headed to its Pacific Ocean route for Seoul, South
Korea.
   Lawyers for the families presented as expert witnesses two
pilots who theorized that the crew aboard the KAL plane
misprogrammed at least one and possibly all three on-board
computerized navigation systems while the Boeing 747 was on the
ground in Anchorage.
   Milton Sincoff, one of the families' lawyers, said that even KAL
acknowledges the wreckage from Flight 007 plummeted into the Sea of
Japan, which would put it far off its Pacific Ocean course.
   KAL attorney George Tompkins countered that the main evidence in
the case is a line drawn by Soviet officials on a map showing an
off-course Flight 007 flying for several hours over Russian
airspace hundreds of miles to the west of its planned route.
   ``That Russian line ... was furnished by the people who shot
this plane down and killed these people,'' said Tompkins. ``This
disaster ... is going to remain a mystery until the Russians come
forward and say what evidence they have to support that black
line.''
   Tompkins said that to suggest the plane was off course for four
hours means that the crew radioed in false position reports at
three checkpoints in the Pacific Ocean.
   ``You must conclude they lied on every position report,'' said
Tompkins. ``To accept the plaintiffs' theory, you have to buy that
Russian line.''
   In the final hour of the flight after giving its last position
report, ``something happened,'' acknowledged Tompkins, who offered
no explanation. In order to end up in the Sea of Japan after being
on course just an hour previously, the plane would have had to
abruptly change direction and head into Soviet territory.
   Sincoff said it is ``frankly impossible'' for Flight 007 to have
been on course at its last radioed check point an hour before it
was shot down. He said the distance from the check point to the
crash site is 660 miles and that the plane was flying at 500 mph.
   But Tompkins said it is not believeable that the plane spent
several hours over Soviet territory.
   Lawyers for the families ``want you to believe that he (the
pilot of Flight 007) was flying through Russia chattering on the
radio ... so he wouldn't have to turn around and dump fuel'' and
land back in Anchorage, said Tompkins.
   Lawyers for the families are trying to prove that crew members
on the plane had to have known that they were off course, yet
decided to continue the flight rather than returning to Anchorage,
where they would have faced disciplinary action.
   If the jury is convinced the airline crew was guilty of willful
misconduct, that will entitle the families to seek damages in
excess of a $75,000-per-passenger limit established by
international treaty.

   Owners of the tanker that ran aground
and spilled 300,000 gallons of oil in Rhode Island Sound have
agreed to put up $4.7 million while liability negotiations
continue, the attorney general said Tuesday.
   Representatives of Ballard Shipping Co. signed a letter of
undertaking, which agrees to make available $3.2 million to pay for
damages to Rhode Island's natural resources and more than $1
million for cleanup costs not covered by the federal government,
Attorney General James O'Neil said at a news conference.
   ``In lieu of arresting the vessel we have this bond established
that we can levy upon. That doesn't mean that we can't go beyond
that if we find that there are greater damages,'' he said. ``It's a
showing of good faith by the owners.''
   Ballard Shipping is ``not even agreeing that the environment has
been damaged to the tune of $3.2 million,'' O'Neil explained.
``They are simply agreeing to put it on the table.''
   The heating oil was spilled at the entrance to Narragansett Bay
on June 23 when the Greek-flagged World Prodigy struck a reef.
   The ship's captain, Iakovos Georgudis, 43, of Athens, has been
charged under state law with failing to have a harbor pilot on
board and with polluting the coastal waters. He faces a total
$20,000 in fines and 13 months in jail if convicted. He also faces
federal misdemeanor charges.
   Ballard Shipping also said it will make available $500,000 for
settlements with individuals who were financially hurt by the spill.
   ``We're confident that $4.7 million will adequately cover the
total of the claims,'' said Nick Long, chief of the attorney
general's civil division.
   The Coast Guard has estimated the clean up costs at almost $2
million, but O'Neil said the state costs had not been fully tallied.
   Approximately $2.6 million from the federal Clean Water Act Fund
is also available to pay for part of the clean up, said Long.
   O'Neil said the attorney general's office has received
complaints from about 300 fishermen who claim they suffered
financial losses as a result of the spill.

   Forty parents burst into applause Tuesday
as a judge ordered a school bus driver held without bail on charges
of molesting a 13-year-old boy for almost three years.
   Robert Izzo, 39, of Hicksville, a former Boy Scout leader,
pleaded innocent in Nassau County Court on a 20-count indictment
charging him with sex abuse, sodomy and endangering the welfare of
a child.
   Izzo, who also is charged with abusing a 5-year-old girl, is
being investigated in as many as 20 other reported incidents of
molestations, police say.
   His attorney, Anthony Capetola, requested that Izzo be released
on $50,000 bail. He argued that Izzo had no prior police record,
had been regularly employed and is married. Izzo maintains he is
innocent.
   Maureen Riordan, assistant district attorney, argued for $1
million bail, citing a strong case and an ongoing investigation.
   When County Judge Marvin Goodman announced that Izzo was to be
held without bail pending a pre-probation report Friday, parents
shrieked and applauded.
   Izzo was arrested May 21 and charged with sexually abusing the
boy from 1986 to 1988, allegedly on buses parked in the garage of
Harran Bus Transportation, where Izzo was employed, and in Izzo's
car and home.
   He was released on $20,000 bail but was rearrested last month
when he was charged with abusing a 5-year-old girl who rode his
bus. A grand jury is soon to begin hearing evidence in the girl's
case.

<TEXT>
   The Christian commander of the army said
Tuesday the Lebanese people will rebel against the Syrian army,
which the Arab League has blamed for blocking efforts to end the
14-year-old civil war.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 predominantly Christian troops have
been locked in fierce artillery battles with Syria's 40,000 troops
in Lebanon for the past five months.
   ``The era of the popular liberation revolt will not be far....
It will be a sweeping river of resistance in every city, village,
street and house,'' Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, told his forces.
   Police said one person was killed and four were wounded in a
pre-dawn howitzer duel between Syrian and Christian gunners across
Beirut's dividing green line, bringing the overall casulty toll to
511 killed and 2,162 wounded since the confrontation erupted March
8.
   Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peace-keeping mandate. But Aoun and other Christian leaders claim
they have betrayed their role by fighting on the Moslem side in the
civil war and should pull out.
   Aoun's remarks Tuesday were published by the independent daily
newspaper An-Nahar and other publications to mark Lebanon's Army
Day.
   He said the (Syrian) ``occupation will be eliminated and the
nation is heading toward (practicing) sovereignty.''
   A three-member committee of Arab foreign ministers said it has
reached an impasse in its bid to end Lebanon's civil war, mainly
because ``Syria's concept of spreading (Lebanese state) sovereignty
is different from the committee's stand on this matter,'' a
statement said without elaborating.
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria
proposed ``a timetable for a government of national entente to
spread its authority with its own forces over the whole of
Lebanon,'' according to the statement issued in Rabat, Morocco.
   But Syria, which considers Lebanon within its sphere of
influence, refused to accept the timetable, the statement said.
   The Saudi, Moroccan and Algerian heads of state were asked at an
Arab League summit May 26 to work out a peace plan for Lebanon by
November.
   Algeria's state-run television said the committee would ask Arab
heads of state to decide on the next move.
   In Syria, the government-owned Damascus radio blamed Aoun.
   The radio, without disclosing details, said: ``Aoun and his
clique are responsible for the committee's failure.''
   The broadcast accused the Christian general of attempting to
partition the war-ravaged nation into mini-states along sectarian
lines and said ``the people of Lebanon shall not allow the
partition conspiracy to pass.''
   The current wave of violence started after Aoun blockaded
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut for
depriving the ailing state treasury of about $100 million in lost
customs dues annually.
   The Syrians and their Moslem militia allies retaliated by laying
siege to the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the
capital, shelling its coastline and blocking its land exits.
   The ferocious shelling duels have devastated Beirut and forced
more than 1.2 million of an original 1.5 million population to
abandon the city and seek refuge in safer areas.
   In southern Lebanon, meanhile, a police spokesman said Tuesday
that Israeli-allied militiamen killed three guerrillas in a clash
near the southern village of Sahqra, eight miles from the Israeli
border in Israel's self-declared security zone.
   Israel kept control of the six-to-10-mile-wide zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its invading army from south Lebanon in June
1985.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a Syrian-backed faction, said
the guerrillas were on their way to carry out an attack ``against
the Zionist enemy.''
   The police spokesman also said gunmen shot and wounded two
officials of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah
guerrilla group in the southern city of Sidon.
   He said three gunmen in a green car opened fire with automatic
rifles, wounding Fatah's comptroller in Lebanon, Mahmoud Asadi, and

<HEAD>Public Health Chief Blames Congress for AIDS Funding Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Public Health Service
acknowledged Tuesday that little federal money is available for
early treatment of people infected with the AIDS virus, but blamed
Congress for failing to allocate the money.
   Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health at the
Department of Health and Human Services, said Congress often fails
to provide additional money to pay for new programs it authorizes.
   ``I think that's interesting,'' he said.
   ``It would be helpful if you folks would provide leadership,''
shot back Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House oversight
subcommittee grilling Mason and other administration officials
about a broad range of AIDS programs.
   Although the exchanges never got more testy than that, there was
a consistent undercurrent of disagreement over who bears prime
responsibility for what Weiss and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
maintained was inadequate financing for AIDS treatment.
   The two House members represent the two cities with the largest
AIDS populations, New York and San Francisco.
   Mason noted that Congress authorized $15 million last fall to
help pay for AZT administered to patients who could not afford to
pay for it themselves during the current fiscal year. AZT, which
costs several thousand dollars a year per patient, is the only
approved drug treatment for AIDS.
   However, the AZT authorization did not carry with it a new
appropriation to replace the one that had been used up. That left
HHS officials with the choice of ignoring Congress' direction to
continue paying for the drug or dipping into other AIDS budget
accounts to come up with the $15 million.
   Mason, who headed the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
before being appointed to the No. 2 HHS job by President Bush, said
he faces a similar dilemma in the emerging fiscal 1990 budget
because the AZT program is authorized at $30 million but not
included in the appropriations bill scheduled for debate later this
week.
   ``The only place I can find that (money) is to take it out of
prevention or biomedical research,'' said Mason. ``Someone has to
make a priority decision.''
   From a broader perspective, Mason pointed out that he also bears
responsiblity for preparing the entire Public Health Service
budget, which includes the National Insitutes of Health, the Food
and Drug Administration and several lesser known agencies.
   ``What is enough (money for AIDS)?'' he asked rhetorically. ``We
can't drop infant mortality or cancer. We could drop any other of
these and do more on AIDS, but I don't think that is what the
nation wants us to do.''
   Pelosi, expressing concern that three specific early treatment
demonstration programs for which she won congressional
authorization have not been funded, acknowledged that ``there has
to be a bigger pie'' and that the congressional appropriations
committees do not like to be ``too specific'' in how they allocate
money.
   On the other hand, she said, health programs have little hope of
getting a larger slice of the federal budget pie ``unless the (HHS)
department is going to squeak a lot louder.''
   Mason assured the congresswoman that HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan ``is a very squeaky secretary.''
   Still, Mason suggested that most of the money appropriated to
the department is very specifically defined.
   ``We have been getting very clear guidance except when we get an
authorization without an appropriation,'' he said.
   The human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee
of the House Committee on Government Operations, which held
Tuesday's hearing, does not have jurisdiction for legislation
either authorizing or appropriating money for HHS programs.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee, opening
hearings on measures to ban desecration of the flag, was urged
Tuesday to shun partisan politics and ``punish'' flag burners by
ignoring them.
   ``Every politician in the Congress should recognize that to be
ignored is the ultimate punishment society can inflict,'' said
former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, a Maryland Republican.
   Robert H. Bork, returning to the committee that led the way in
blocking his confirmation to the Supreme Court, testified in favor
of amending the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration.
   Bork's schedule did not allow time for committee members to
question him. But he told reporters outside the hearing room, ``I
have no particular emotional response'' to returning to the
committee that questioned him for five days in 1987 before voting
against his nomination by then-President Ronald Reagan.
   The full Senate agreed, voting against him, 58-42.
   Bork agreed there was an irony in his appearance since the man
confirmed for the seat Bork had been up for _ Anthony M. Kennedy _
voted with the majority in the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that flag
burning is protected free speech. Bork has said if he were on the
court he would have voted to uphold a Texas law against flag
desecration.
   Asked whether he believed the judiciary committee is capable of
handling the issue properly, Bork said, ``You may record that I
grinned broadly.''
   Mathias, recalling a Longfellow poem, said the ``ship of state
sailing majestically through history'' should treat flag burners
with the same indifference as ``slugs and snails and slimy
creatures whose submarine activities do not cause the great ship to
deviate a degree from its course.''
   The committee is considering proposals to amend the Constitution
or enact legislation to reverse a Supreme Court ruling June 21 that
said burning or desecrating the flag as a form of political protest
is a constitutional right.
   Similar proposals are being weighed in the House. A
Democratic-sponsored bill could be voted on next month in the House
after Congress returns from a recess due to begin Friday.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,
said he plans to hold four hearings on anti-flag burning proposals.
   Biden is sponsoring legislation to make to it a crime to
desecrate the American flag, an alternative to a proposed
constitutional amendment backed by the Bush administration and many
Republicans.
   Opponents of both proposals said Tuesday that Congress and
President Bush are overreacting.
   ``We are caught up in a crass competition about who loves the
flag more,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``We want to use
the flag against our opponent in the next election and we want to
be sure it is not used against us.''
   But Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., sponsor of a proposed
constitutional amendment, said, ``An overwhelming majority of
Americans are looking to the Congress to ... restore the proper
civil respect for our American flag.''
   He noted that after the high court ruling, the Senate voted 97-3
to express disapproval with the justices' decision. That action
carried no legal weight.
   Metzenbaum and Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., were the three who opposed the resolution
condemning the court ruling.
   All three are Judiciary Committee members who urged their
colleagues Tuesday to withdraw plans to reverse the court's
decision.
   Humphrey produced a pair of bedroom slippers with an American
flag design. ``That seems to me to be desecration,'' he said.

   The House decided by voice vote Tuesday to
give the ethics committee an infusion of $500,000 to continue its
work this year.
   No further congressional action is needed. The committee spent
more than $1.5 million for the yearlong investigation of former
House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned his seat in June after the
committee charged him with 69 rules violations.
   The panel could face other major investigations if it decides to
proceed with complaints filed against GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill, and Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., asked the panel to investigate
whether a controversial book deal arranged by Gingrich violated
campaign finance law, a House rule on outside income and a rule
prohibiting retention of gifts from those with a direct interest in
legislation.
   The committee has hired the Chicago law firm that investigated
Wright to recommend whether the panel should begin a preliminary
investigation of Gingrich.
   Three House members have asked the committee to investigate
allegations by a Peace Corps volunteer that Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., sexually assaulted her while he was on an official trip to
Zaire.
   And the House Republican caucus has asked the panel to probe
Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, who was convicted of
contributing to the delinquency or unruliness of a minor. He is
appealing.

<TEXT>
   Poles expressed shock Tuesday at soaring
food prices and Parliament dismissed the government of Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski. Legislators argued over Rakowski's
successor .
   Solidarity lawmakers heaped criticism on the outgoing
administration's economic policies. The union movement was reported
to be considering a proposal that could lead to a Solidarity prime
minister.
   Meat price increases on Tuesday were the highest in recent
memory. Food prices skyrocketed under the ``marketization'' program
put together by Rakowski's government. Across Poland there were
empty shelves and bewildered shoppers.
   ``Where is the meat? Where is the meat?'' cried out an old man
in a store without a scrap of meat.
   ``I am going to America,'' a woman shopper said in despair.
   Authorities say the increases are needed to prompt farmers to
deliver to market and stabilize the level of state subsidies to the
food industry.
   A vote on Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak as prime
minister, set for Tuesday, was postponed amid signs his candidacy
was in trouble in Poland's new pluralistic Parliament.
   Rakowski went to a hospital Tuesday after reportedly feeling
faint but returned to Parliament in the evening for urgent talks
within his communist coalition.
   According to several deputies involved, the caucus leader for
the communist-allied Peasant Party, Aleksander Bentkowski, proposed
that the Peasants and Solidarity form a government with a
Solidarity prime minister. The communists would be left only with
ministries controlling police and the army.
   Opposition sources said Solidarity was considering the proposal.
   One Peasant Party faction was in rebellion against the
communists and its own leadership, walking out when Rakowski came
to address the caucus.
   ``We have a general as president. Now they want a general as
premier. And we know they want a communist to be deputy premier,''
said one rebel, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A member of the Solidarity delegation flew to Gdansk to review
the situation with union founder Lech Walesa. Walesa had urged
Solidarity followers to vote against Kiszczak, the candidate
advanced Monday by the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party.
   Rakowski, elected party first secretary four days ago, was
formally dismissed as prime minister by Parliament on Tuesday.
   Referring to Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula's claim that
the ``ship of the Polish economy is on the right course,''
Solidarity Deputy Ryszard Bugaj said, ``It seems to me that the
situation is the exact opposite. This ship is sinking.''
   Walesa did not explain his reasons for urging deputies to vote
against Kiszczak who, as interior minister, was in charge of the
police forces.
   The image of the top policeman as head of government has upset
many Poles, and Solidarity met dissent from followers when it
accepted Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's election as president July 19.
   ``I am against Gen. Kiszczak's candidacy for prime minister,''
Walesa said, without elaborating.
   Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek said Monday he
expected Kiszczak to be elected even without support from
Solidarity lawmakers, who are outnumbered 299-161 by the communist
coalition in the Sejm. But the matter appeared uncertain Tuesday.
   The Peasant Party's 76 votes are needed to give the 173-strong
communist delegation a working majority.
   The parliament session began with criticism of the 9-month-old
Rakowski government that lasted nearly five hours, dwelling on high
inflation and the lack of goods in stores.
   Sekula defended the government, saying it lifted over 3,000
regulations and brought ``a different quality to our nation. ... We
acted in Poland's interest and in the interest of ... our society.''
   Food prices now will vary from store to store and region to
region, depending on supply and demand, officials said. According
to the state-controlled newspaper Zycie Warszawy, the new prices
included:
   _ Sugar, 60 cents for 2.2 pounds, up from 42 cents, a 43 percent
increase.
   _ Butter, 48 cents for about half a pound, up from 27 cents, a
73 percent increase.
   _ Flour, 12 cents for 2.2 pounds, up from 7 cents, a 56 percent
increase.
   Meat increases in state stores were steeper. Ham went from $1.92
for 2.2 pounds to about $7.22, a 275 percent increase, and pork
went from $1.08 for 2.2 pounds to about $4.21, a 288 percent
increase. The meat prices were still somewhat below those charged
at private farmer's markets.
   The average monthly income in Poland is $127.
   On Monday, parliament passed a key piece of legislation designed
to blunt the population's anger about inflation, now in triple
digits. The law, agreed to in principle in April by government and
Solidarity negotiators, calls for the incomes of workers, farmers
and pensioners to be compensated automatically for 80 percent of
the rise in the cost of living.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday his
government was making contacts in an effort to free hostages in
Lebanon, and sources said direct approaches were made to Lebanese
Shiite Moslems for a prisoner swap.
   Israeli officials said it remained willing to exchange a Moslem
cleric kidnapped by Israel, and other Lebanese Shiite prisoners,
for Israeli soldiers and Western hostages. The radical Shiite group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued a statement spurning the deal.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, called the offer humanitarian
and fair, and added: ``We believe it is not Hezbollah's last word.''
   Israel television said the army would let the International
Committee of the Red Cross visit the kidnapped Lebanese clergymen
and his two abducted assistants if Shiite groups allowed a Red
Cross visit to three Israeli soldiers believed to be held captive
in south Lebanon.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed the report but would not
give details.
   Israel insisted it would not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid
despite threats by Shiite kidnappers to kill Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   When asked by the national news agency Itim whether Obeid might
be turned over to U.S. authorities, Shamir replied he could not say
what might be done.
   The Israelis say Obeid planned guerrilla attacks on Israel and
directed the kidnapping in February 1988 of Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, a U.S. Marine officer on U.N. duty in south Lebanon.
   On Monday, Higgins' captors said they had hanged him and
released a poor-quality videotape showing a man on a gallows. The
kidnappers said he was hanged in retaliation for Obeid's abduction,
but there have been reports Higgins was killed several months ago.
   Shamir said Tuesday night that Higgins was ``apparently dead,''
and added: ``We express our deep sorrow to his family and the
American people.''
   During a factory tour earlier, Shamir said there was ``a common
interest and a common goal'' between Israel and the United States
on freeing hostages, but noted the reason for capturing Obeid was
to free the three Israeli soldiers held in south Lebanon.
   ``The only purpose of our operation was to free our captured
soldiers,'' he said. ``If, at the same time, we manage to set free
other hostages, we will be happy.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told reporters in Jerusalem that
Israel viewed the new death threats as ``disinformation.''
   ``We do not have much faith in the truthfulness of the
announcements that come from these organizations,'' he said. ``It
would probably not be very wise to take any action based on that
information.''
   Itim, the Israeli news agency, reported Tuesday that Shamir was
making contacts to free Western captives, and he said on his
factory tour: ``There are permanent contacts with various factors
about the release of the hostages.''
   Pazner said the contacts were indirect, through the United
States and international organizations.
   Some Israeli sources, speaking privately, said talks were being
held directly with Lebanese Shiites about the proposed
prisoner-hostage trade.
   Security sources said Israel is believed to hold 50-60 Lebanese
Shiite Moslems in Israel and, through its surrogate South Lebanon
Army militia, about 300 in southern Lebanon.
   Israel made the offer to free Shiite prisoners in exchange for
its soldiers and foreign hostages on Monday, before the
announcement that Higgins had been killed.
   Shamir defended the abduction of Obeid as ``a strong, energetic
effort'' to help free the captured soldiers.
   ``If need be we will take stronger steps,'' he told a ceremony
in Jerusalem marking the 49th anniversary of the death of Israeli
pioneer Zeev Jabotinsky.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges $50 Million Food Aid to Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced Tuesday the United
States will provide up to $50 million in food aid for Poland to
help avert shortages in the country as it struggles to reform its
government and economy.
   Bush, who visited Poland last month, said the food ``will assist
in alleviating the impact of market price reforms and support
continued efforts toward economic and political liberalization.''
   He said the new aid ``will include, but go far beyond, the 8,000
metric tons of surplus commodities'' already targeted for the East
Bloc country for fiscal 1990 under the American Aid to Poland Act.
   ``We intend to provide to Poland supplies of sorghum, corn and
butter, subject to the availability of those commodities,'' he said.
   ``We anticipate that all this aid will be on a grant basis. The
commodities would be sold in Poland,'' with proceeds used to fund
agricultural development efforts there, he said.
   An urgent call for international help to avert food shortages in
Poland went out both from last month's Western economic summit in
Paris and from Monday's meeting in Brussels of 24 concerned nations
chaired by the European Community Commission.
   Bush, who promised in Poland to seek $100 million from Congress
for a new Polish-American Enterprise Fund, said this new food aid
``should be of real benefit to the Polish people,'' both through
the commodities themselves and through the projects funded by sale
of those foodstuffs.
   Bush promised in Warsaw ``the United States will stand with
Poland'' and support its economic and political reforms. He said
change cannot come without sacrifices upon the part of the Polish
people, but promised that ``the United States stands ready to help
as you help yourselves.''

   ``People here like to see advertising that is in keeping with

<HEAD>Senate Committee Defeats Lucas Civil Rights Nomination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday rejected William Lucas as the nation's top
civil rights enforcer on a 7-7 tie vote and the Justice Department
said the nomination was doomed.
   `He's lacking in experience and qualifications, his managerial
accomplishments are debatable,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
who cast a critical vote against confirmation.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blamed the rejection on ``raw
politics,'' and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., urged the
president to name Lucas to the post on an interim basis that would
not require Senate appproval.
   The committee first refused to give a favorable recommendation
to Lucas for the post of assistant attorney general for civil
rights. On a second 7-7 tie vote, it rejected sending the nominee
to the full Senate without any recommendation.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., joined six Republicans in
supporting Lucas while seven Democrats voted against him.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The
committee's action on Mr. Lucas is very disappointing to the
president. ... We felt he deserved better treatment and he deserved
that position.''
   ``In terms of where we go from here, we're now exploring our
options,'' Fitzwater added.
   Asked about Dole's idea of a recess appointment, he said, ``I
don't know whether he had any discussions with the White House or
not. No decisions have been made, however, about either Mr. Lucas'
future or how we might approach the job at the Justice Department.''
   Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., called giving Lucas a
recess appointment a ``bad idea.''
   Congressional and White House sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said such an action would touch off a confrontation
between Bush and the Senate.
   A White House source said the president would not likely want to
``up the ante'' with Congress so early in the administration.
   Civil rights groups and their Senate allies campaigned for
Lucas' defeat, saying the 61-year-old former sheriff of Wayne
County, Michigan, lacked the experience and knowledge to be
effective in the civil rights position.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, who opposed
Lucas' nomination, praised the committee vote and added, ``Mr.
Lucas is qualified for many positions in the administration and we
would certainly urge that his services not be lost.''
   Before the committee acted, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
panel's ranking Republican, urged approval, saying, ``It seems to
me that we ought to give this black man a chance.''
   ``He's a minority, of course. Years ago, minorities didn't have
a chance, I know,'' said Thurmond, one of the best known critics of
civil rights legislation in the era of racial segregation.
   ``If it had been a white man who had been nominated who had the
same background, no experience in the field, no experience as a
lawyer, no expertise in this specialized field, he wouldn't have
gotten anywhere,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who cast the
deciding vote against the nomination.
   ``I think the fact that Mr. Lucas was black caused much more
consideration to be given to him,'' he said.
   Biden said efforts by Lucas supporters to portray opposition to
him as racially motivated amounted to ``a cynical set up.'' He
noted that opponents included Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
other lawmakers who have been strong champions of the civil rights
cause.
   The committee's action represented Thornburgh's second recent
rebuff from the panel. In June, he reluctantly withdrew the
nomination of Robert B. Fiske Jr. as deputy attorney general after
conservatives complained.
   Thornburgh said in a statement that rejection of Lucas, a former
Democrat who was the Republican candidate for governor of Michigan
in 1986, came as a ``result of raw politics.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said, ``It was obvious
that the opponents felt they didn't have the votes to defeat him on
the floor, so they killed him in committee.''
   Runkel said Lucas would remain at the department as a
$284.50-a-day consultant and said there were no other candidates
``as of today.''
   Thurmond said he knew of no realistic way for the Lucas
nomination to come to the Senate floor. In theory, the Senate could
vote to take the matter out of the committee's hands, but that
route is strewn with potential for filibusters and other roadblocks.
   On the Senate floor, however, Dole urged Bush to make a
so-called recess appointment under which Lucas could serve in the
post for a number of months without being confirmed. Bush could
make such a move as soon as Congress recesses, scheduled for the
end of the week.
   Dole criticized the Judiciary Committee, saying that ``political
partisanship has taken over and twisted the nomination process.''
   The primary argument against Lucas was that he lacked
experience. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, cited a remark by
the nominee that he was ``new to the law.''
   ``Would we accept a key economics adviser who is new to
economics? Would we accept a science adviser who is new to
science?'' Metzenbaum asked.
   Supporters said Lucas would apply the hard lessons he learned in
his climb from dishwasher to policeman to FBI agent to Wayne County
official.
   In addition to Lucas' lack of experience, critics cited problems
that included the failure to declare $8,800 worth of goods at
Customs en route home from an Asian trip, neglecting to make
court-ordered improvements at the jail when he was Wayne County
sheriff, and making untrue statements in seeking admission to the
New York bar.
   Lucas said he had not known the goods were in his family's
luggage and that he made the jail improvements as soon as he could.
The Justice Department said misstatements Lucas made on the bar
application resulted from misinterpretation of the questions.
   The name of Robert Bork, rejected by the Senate for a Supreme
Court seat, surfaced repeatedly in the panel's sometimes bitter
debate. Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said Lucas deserved to be
sent to the Senate floor to receive the same ``rehabilitation''
accorded Bork.
   Biden retorted that Bork had been defeated on the floor. ``If
that's rehabilitation, I don't know what rehabilitation is,'' he
said.
   Simpson, however, declared that ``civil rights groups have just
gone goofy'' over the Lucas nomination and should themselves be
investigated.

   Customers gaped in disbelief Tuesday at
freshly lettered signs announcing the highest meat price increases
in recent memory. The cost of other key food items also skyrocketed.
   ``Where is the meat?'' cried out an old man in a store without
meat.
   ``There is no meat, just the price list,'' a woman complained.
   There were empty shelves and bewildered shoppers at meat stores
and markets throughout Poland as official price increases took
effect.
   Authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to
deliver their meat and produce to market and stabilize the level of
state subsidies to the food industry.
   Price increases occur regularly in Poland, but the scale of the
latest boost drove many customers to despair. Lifting of the ration
system after seven years caused no joy since meat was so scarce.
   ``I am going to America! Of course, I am going to America!,''
shouted one woman after taking a look at the newest list of meat
prices in the Supersam supermarket.
   The price of pork roast, an expensive and popular cut, rose from
980 zlotys ($1.18) to 3,850 zlotys ($4.64) a kilogram (2.2 pounds).
Regular sausage rose from 52 cents to $1.80 a kilogram.
   The average monthly income in Poland is $127.
   Private farmers standing outside a state market in central
Warsaw demanded even higher prices. One farmer wanted $7.23 a
kilogram for ham and $4.82 a kilo for beef that was covered with
flies.
   Inside the Hala Mirowska market supplies of state-supplied meat
were all sold up by 2 p.m.
   Customers at other shops were less fortunate. A large meat store
near parliament closed Tuesday for a monthlong vacation. The
usually well-stocked Supersam was down to scrawny chickens and
cheap cuts of pork by midafternoon.
   A sign in the empty meat shop on Krakowskie Przedmiescie street
said the store had frozen duck and goose available and a sales
clerk said she hoped chickens would be delivered later in the day.
   ``How much will the chickens cost?'' asked one customer. ``I
don't know, dear, I don't know,'' replied the sales clerk.
   Until now, meat prices in state stores have been the same
throughout country. As of Tuesday, however, prices will be
determined by the supplier and may vary from store to store.
   Among other items that cost more Tuesday were sugar, which went
up from 42 cents to 60 cents a kilogram, but was unavailable in
many shops. Butter was up from 27 cents for a quarter kilogram to
48 cents. Flour increased from 7 cents a kilogram to 12 cents.
   In one food store some items available were unfit for
consumption. Stacks of moldy bread were piled in a corner. Bottles
of milk with flies inside were on the shelves.
   ``Why bother to stand in line for stuff like this,'' said a
woman as she picked through the available items.
   Even the normally well-supplied restaurant in the parliament
where deputies met to debate the formation of a new government felt
the pinch of the new prices.
   Bean soup and tripe were the main items as the restaurant was
out of one of the lawmakers' favorite breakfast dishes _ hot dogs
wrapped in bacon. ``We don't have any and we don't know how much
we'll have to charge when we get them,'' a waitress told a
Solidarity deputy.
   The food price increases are part of a government
``marketization'' program aimed to prompt farmers to produce more
by introducing free-market concepts.
   Some Solidarity lawmakers claimed marketization was only a way
of disguising price increases. Over the weekend the government said
reduction of subsidies would diminish ``eventually.''
   Parliament on Monday passed by a 335-29 vote legislation
designed to cushion consumers from the impact of price increases
and inflation now rising at an estimated 160 percent rate annually.
   The law on indexing _ agreed to in principle in April by
government and Solidarity negotiators _ calls for incomes of
workers, farmers and pensioners, to be automatically conmpensated
by 80 percent of the rise in the cost of living.
   Lawmakers hope indexing will reduce the chance of strikes and
overall wage increases from outpacing price rises.

   ``All options are open'' to President Bush if
he intends to retaliate for the apparent murder of Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday, but he refused to
define them or say whether any action had been taken to ready U.S.
forces in the Mideast.
   Spokesman Pete Williams said the aircraft carrier Coral Sea,
which is on duty in the Mediterranean, left the Egyptian port of
Alexandria ``a little early'' Tuesday, but he declined to give its
destination or say why it had put out to sea earlier than planned.
   ``We don't discuss future deployments. ... We don't discuss
alert status,'' Williams said when asked about the ship's movement.
   Queried about the list of miliary options that Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney delivered Monday evening to the White House, Williams
replied, ``All options are open,'' and refused to discuss them
further.
   Navy sources said the Coral Sea, on duty with the 6th Fleet in
the Mediterranean, left ``a few hours'' ahead of its scheduled
departure.
   The carrier is accompanied by its battle group, which included
the nuclear cruiser Virginia and the Aegis cruiser San Jacinto,
said the sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
   Also on hand is a 2,400-member Marine contingent known as the
Amphibious Readiness Group, which is aboard three ships designed to
aid any landing assault they are ordered to carry out, the sources
said.
   Overall, there are some 24 U.S. ships in the Mediterranean at
this time, with approximately 20 others in the Persian Gulf and
Indian Ocean region, the sources added.
   The battleship Iowa, which is not allowed to use its 16-inch
guns pending the outcome of a Navy inquiry into the April explosion
in one of its three turrets, is on a port call in Marseilles,
France, the sources said. The ship is equipped with a variety of
weapons, including cruise missiles, that could be used if
necessary, sources said.
   A Pentagon official familiar with the options presented to the
president confirmed that they included such possibilities as the
bombing or shelling of certain areas, a surgical strike against
specific terrorist camps, or even a simple ``show-of-the-flag'' of
the U.S. forces on duty in the region.
   ``A lot of these options have been around for some time,'' said
the official, who noted that crises in the Middle East have
bedeviled more than one recent president.
   The Joint Chiefs' staff draws up such options for consideration
by the president and National Security Council, and includes the
pros and cons of each step.
   ``This isn't a situation where they had to come up with a lot of
original thinking. Some of these options have been on the shelf for
some time. In many cases, they dusted 'em off and evaluated them in
light of the current situation,'' said the official.
   He cautioned, however, that there is little indication that any
high-level planning for a full-blown military strike is underway.
For example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not met, he noted.
   And the pattern of the Pentagon in recent history has been to
use military force as only the last resort, the source said.
   ``These guys have been on the cautious side,'' he said.
   Each option must be assessed for the kind of target it presents,
the type of weaponry eeded, the type of forces that may be deployed
against U.S. forces and the kind of ``collateral damage,'' or
number of civilians that might be killed in any action, the source
said.
   But, as in many past cases dealing with the U.S. hostages, such
considerations are not viewed from a strictly limited military
point of view, the Pentagon officials noted.
   As one Army source said, ``With the power of the 6th Fleet, we
could blow Beirut off the map. But what good would that do?''

   Poland's communist president and Roman
Catholic prelate dedicated a monument Tuesday to the fighters in
Warsaw's doomed 1944 uprising against the Nazis in which more than
200,000 Poles perished.
   Sirens wailed throughout the city at 5 p.m. _ the hour when the
uprising began 45 years ago.
   In the evening, after the official ceremony attended by
President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the
opposition movement held its own observance attended by Solidarity
lawmakers. They went by bus from parliament to a different, newly
dedicated monument in Powazki Cemetery. That monument is dedicated
to the leaders of the underground resistance during World Wasr II.
   The Waraw uprising and its brutal aftermath remain controversial
in Poland because most of the underground leaders were loyal to the
wartime government-in-exile in London, which was not recognized by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   Many Poles believe Stalin deliberately withheld help for the
Warsaw fighters, allowing the Nazis to wipe them out while the Red
Army stalled its advance on the eastern side of the Vistula River
that runs through Warsaw.
   Stalin also refused British requests to let relief planes land
behind Red Army lines to supply the 63-day uprising.
   When the Red Army arrived in Warsaw in January 1945, after the
Nazis had systematically destroyed the city no significant force
remained to resist the communist takeover of the country.
   In the years immediately after World War II, the anniversary of
the uprising was not observed and soldiers of the resistance Home
Army who remained in Poland often were imprisoned and deported to
Siberia or executed.
   Jaruzelski referred indirectly to those events in his speech at
the new monument near the city's Old Town section.
   ``This epoch included injustice, human harm and concealment,''
he said. ``This book has already been closed.''
   ``The atmosphere is different today,'' said Jan Kostrzewski, who
served as a doctor in the uprising and who headed the committee
that erected the monument. ``After more than 40 years, efforts are
made to repair the wrongs. .... But it is not easy to remove from
our hearts the bitter sediment.''
   Glemp later consecrated the monument with holy water as
Jaruzelski, in full military uniform looked on, the first time in
memory that a Polish leader took part in such a religious ceremony.
   The communist government normalized relations with the Polish
church this year and established diplomatic relations with the
Vatican.

   Anguished relatives of hostage Joseph
Cicippio reacted to his two-day reprieve Tuesday with caution and
hope that his captors would free him after three years.
   ``I am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endure
this for another two days,'' said David Cicippio, 27. ``We are
being held hostage, just like my father,'' he said, waiting out the
crisis at his uncle Thomas' home.
   David Cicippio, an electronics technician from North Wales, Pa.,
voiced frustration with the latest ordeal, which was provoked by
the Israeli abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid, last week.
   Cicippio's Shiite captors on Monday set an 11 a.m. EDT deadline
Tuesday for Obeid's release, but more than two hours later, at 1:15
p.m. EDT, the extremists announced a 48-hour extension.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization announced Cicippio's
reprieve in a 13-line handwritten statement in Arabic delivered to
the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.
   The threat came shortly after another group said Monday it had
hanged hostage Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in retaliation for
Obeid's abduction.
   Cicippio's brother Thomas, who earlier Tuesday told reporters he
was ``depressed and nervous'' as the deadline approached, called
the extension ``good news for all of us.''
   ``When I got up this morning, I really didn't think there was
much of a chance we would get a reprieve,'' Cicippio said. ``For
the next two days, we want to see what kind of movements take
place.''
   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
hostage, agreed that the extension could improve the situation.
   ``I think the longer they talk, the longer they delay, the
greater the chances that we may turn this around and get them all
home,'' said Ms. Say in Nashville, Tenn.
   Anderson, 41, was the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press when he was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Former hostage David Jacobsen said the Israeli action that
apparently led to the reported hanging of Higgins may have spoiled
plans for Anderson's release.
   Jacobsen, speaking from his Colorado home, said sources in
London told him that Anderson was to be freed last Saturday by the
new Iranian government as a gesture of good will.
   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller at the American
University of Beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept.
12, 1986.
   Among those gathered at Thomas Cicippio's home were Joseph
Cicippio's sons David and Joseph Jr., 34, whose mother and Cicippio
are divorced, and his brother Anthony.
   ``It's time we took some kind of action. Who knows what kind of
threats are going to be made in the next 48 hours? I have President
Bush in my prayers and I pray that he makes the right choice,''
David Cicippio said.
   He was asked if he meant military action and the possibility
that it would endanger his father's life.
   ``If my father's life was taken, it would be for a worthy
cause,'' he said. ``I feel whatever it takes to get them home
should be done. It would be a message: No more hostages should be
taken.'''
   Thomas Cicippio on Tuesday, however, repeated his opposition to
the use of military action to rescue his brother.
   ``This has to be solved by diplomacy,'' Cicippio said.
   While the Cicippio family waited in Norristown, Joseph
Cicippio's current wife, Elham, tearfully pleaded with his captors
at a news conference in Beirut.
   ``Please don't execute him, please,'' said Mrs. Cicippio, who
works at the American Embassy in east Beirut.
   She read a message to her husband: ``Joe, I know the difficulty
of the situation in which we are but all I ask you is to keep your
hopes high.''

   Five gunmen dragged a leader of
Guatemala's ruling Christian Democratic Party out of his home
Tuesday and shot him dead, witnesses and officials said.
   Police said no group claimed responsibility for kiling Danilo
Barillas Rodriguez and the motive was not clear. President Vinicio
Cerezo, who went to the scene called his friend ``a victim of
democracy.''
   ``I am deeply concerned. This is deplorable,'' Cerezo told
reporters.
   Cerezo took office in January 1986 for a five-year term as the
first elected civilian president after 16 years of rightist
military rule.
   Leftist guerrillas have fought the government for four decades
and right-wing death squads also have operated in Guatemala.
   Barillas had been chairman of a Guatemala city council
commission in charge of urban planning and development since 1987.
He previously served as Guatemala's ambassador to Spain, general
secretary of the Christian Democratic Party and member of the
Chamber of Deputies.
   Cerezo blamed ``extremist groups'' for the slaying and promised
the killers would be found.
   Witnesses said five armed men barged into Barillas' home and
dragged him out. They said the five opened fire after he managed to
slip away and started running, wounding him.
   Barillas then tried to dive under a parked car, and one of the
gunmen shot him dead. The gunmen then fled on foot, one of the
witnesses said.
   A police examiner at the scene said Barillas' body had at least
30 bullet wounds.
   As Guatemala's ambassador to Madrid, Barillas participated in
talks between leaders of the Revolutionary Nationalist Unity, a
coalition of the four guerrilla groups, and a government delegation.
   The talks were to establish grounds for peace negotiations but
did not progress, principally because the military insisted on
complete surrender by the rebels.
   Barillas' death comes amid mounting labor unrest and terrorist
attacks. One person was killed and several were injured in half a
dozen bomb explosions in the capital over the past two weeks.
   About 50,000 public school teachers and government employees
have been on strike for almost two months, demanding higher pay.
They have snarled traffic in Guatemala City with almost daily
street marches and demonstrations.

<HEAD>OSHA Recommends Company Be Prosecuted in Fatal Tunnel Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency recommended Tuesday that two
companies involved in a sewer tunnel explosion that killed three
workers be prosecuted on criminal charges.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent the
recommendation to the U.S. attorney's office, which will review the
Nov. 10 accident to see if charges are warranted.
   The workers were killed when methane gas collected and exploded
in a Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District tunnel that was under
construction.
   The victims had entered the tunnel to check levels of the
naturally occurring gas. Earlier in the day the methane had reached
a dangerous level and forced an evacuation.
   OSHA had already filed numerous civil charges against the S.A.
Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., the tunnel contractor, and CH2M Hill of
Corvallis, Ore., an engineering firm that supervised the work. The
agency also recommended $1.15 million in fines.
   OSHA now wants the civil cases postponed so the case can be
reviewed for possible criminal violations, U.S. Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole said in a statement Tuesday.
   ``We are determined to do whatever is necessary to prevent the
tragic recurrence of such accidents in our nation's ever growing
number of tunnel projects,'' Dole said.
   Both firms have contested the civil citations.
   Healy president George Malina said he did nt know how any
criminal wrongdoing could be found in the accident, which developed
out of unanticipated conditions, not out of any willful acts.
   Wyatt McCauley, spokesman for CH2M Hill, did not immediately
return a phone call to his office in Denver.
   Under the civil proceedings, the companies face fines for
alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Criminal prosecution would carry fines plus possible imprisonment
of up to six months.
   Healy was cited in May for 68 alleged willful violations of
health and safety regulations, and CH2M Hill was cited for 47
willful violations.

<HEAD>Kemp Says Agency Will Tighten Management of Mortgage Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said Tuesday his
department will tighten management of the federal program insuring
the mortgages of millions of homeowners in an effort to reduce
losses and fraud.
   In a letter to members of a Senate subcommittee on housing, Kemp
said that HUD has ``mismanaged'' lending activities under the
Federal Housing Administration, which insures $247 billion worth of
mortgages on single-family homes.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development said that FHA
lost $149.5 million in the six months ending last March 31, and its
losses for the previous fiscal year totaled $369 million.
   HUD officials have said the losses were a temporary phenomenon
that resulted more from a predictable rise in mortgage defaults
that followed a spurt in the housing market.
   But a report last spring by the department's inspector general
also said some of the losses are due to fraud.
   ``Despite the actions taken by the department, the Congress and
our office, schemes to defraud the insurance program continue,''
the inspector general's report said. ``We are unable to estimate
exactly how much of the billions of dollars lost on foreclosed
homes is due to these schemes.''
   The report also said: ``The department cannot continue to
sustain a high level of fraud-related losses without an adverse
effect on the overall mission of the insurance fund.''
   But in his letter, Kemp said FHA's 9 million borrowers were in
no peril.
   Kemp said FHA has surrendered most of the decision-making to
outside parties, mostly the lenders.
   ``HUD has mismanaged this process such that lenders view this
delegated authority as a right instead of a privilege, and HUD has
failed in its efforts to firmly monitor and control lender
activities,'' Kemp's letter said.
   Kemp said FHA would improve its accounting procedures so the
agency would have a better idea of the financial health of the
mortgage insurance fund. In addition, he said the agency would hire
a large accounting firm to point out ways it can improve its
mortgage underwriting practices.

<TEXT>
   The army seized 100 rockets and
arrested about 50 people in raids aimed at ending devastating
rocket attacks on Kabul by Moslem guerrillas, the government said
Tuesday.
   No rockets fell on the city Tuesday, but 14 fired Monday killed
24 people and wounded 58.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the military
was given urgent instructions Monday to take whatever action
necessary to stop the attacks, which have occurred almost daily
since late June.
   U.N. sources say 281 people have been killed and 745 wounded
since June 25 in rocket attacks and a car bombing. Virtually all
the victims were civilians.
   A major search operation started late Monday and continued into
Tuesday in the city and environs, Amani said, and government forces
confiscated many documents and weapons and made about 50 arrests.
   No group claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks. The
Soviet-sponsored government blames the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who
began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
   Amani also reported new fighting between rival fundamentalist
guerrilla groups, Hezb-e-Islami and the Jamiat-e-Islami, in Herat
province near the Iranian border.
   He said 12 members of Jamiat-e-Islami were killed and six
wounded, and six supporters of Hezb-e-Islami were wounded. He gave
no date for the fighting.
   Guerrillas sources have said Hezb-e-Islami supporters attacked a
Jamiat group July 9 in northern Afghanistan, killing 30 people,
including several field commanders.
   Fighting among guerrilla groups has been mentioned as one reason
they have failed to oust the government since the Red Army withdrew
in February after nine years of involvement in the civil war.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, on Tuesday, the United States and Soviet
Union held their first meeting on Afghanistan since the Soviet
withdawal.
   After his meeting with Soviet Ambassador Nikolai Kozyrev, John
Kelly, assistant U.S. secretary of state, said there was a ``frank
exchange of views'' and ``significant differences'' remained.
   The Soviets complain of U.S. aid to the insurgents and
Washington says the Kremlin has increased arms shipments to the
Kabul government.
   Western diplomats in neighboring Pakistan reported an attempt in
Kabul to overthrow President Najib and said a house-to-house search
for suspected conspirators had increased tensions within the ruling
Communist Party.
   One said the hint of a coup attempt emerged about two weeks ago.
   ``There is no indication of how close to being launched the
reported plot was when it was discovered,'' the diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Multiple sources have
reported a sudden upsurge in tension within'' the ruling party.
   A leftist Pakistan newspaper, The Frontier Post, said Defense
Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai was under house arrest for alleged
involvement in the attempt against Najib, who uses only one name.
   It quoted the pro-guerrilla Afghan Media Resource Center. The
diplomats said the claim could not be substantiated.

   The Pentagon reported Tuesday that the remains
of three U.S. servicemen returned by Vietnamese officials have been
identified and thanked the Vietnamese government for its
cooperation.
   The three were identified as Air Force Col. Bobby Kirby, of
Atlanta, Ga.; Army Chief Warrant Officer Michael B. Varnado of
Ferriday, La., and Army Maj. Robert G. Cozart, Jr., of Hammond,
La., the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The remains are to be sent from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii
on Wednesday to Travis Air Force Base, California, the statement
said.
   The remains of Col. Kirby were among 38 sets repatriated by
Vietnam on Dec. 15, 1988, of which some 26 have been identified.
The remains of the other two were among 21 repatriated by Vietnam
on April 27, 1989 and are the first from that group to be
identified, the Pentagon said.
   The other remains are still undergoing analysis.
   ``The U.S. government recognizes and appreciates the increased
efforts of the Vietnamese governmetn which resulted in accounting
for these Americans. We hope that the unilateral turnover of
information and remains will continue to accelerate and that future
joint operations will bring the expanded results both governments
seek,'' the statement said.

   People exposed to asbestos or other toxic
substances can't collect damages just because they may have an
increased risk of cancer, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The court ruled that people could collect damages only if they
develop cancer or can prove through expert testimony that they have
a better than 50 percent chance of getting the disease.
   ``This is a decision that will have major national repercussions
for asbestos and other toxic substance cases,'' said attorney Gita
F. Rothschild, who represented the three companies involved in the
lawsuit.
   ``There are 80,000 cases like this pending in state and federal
courts,'' said Ms. Rothschild. ``In every single case involving
toxic substances, the plaintiffs allege the possibility of
contracting cancer.''
   Ms. Rothschild said the decision allows companies ``to pay
damages for people who actually get sick.''
   The court relied heavily on a lower court ruling that allows
workers and others who are exposed to toxic materials to collect
damages after they have contracted cancer, regardless of how long
after exposure that occurs.
   It also upheld a ruling that ``In New Jersey, damages may not be
awarded for any future injury which is merely possible but not
probable.''
   In a 5-1 decision, the Supreme Court said Roger Mauro and his
wife, Lois, cannot collect damages for his fear that he may
contract cancer after being exposed to asbestos fibers while
working as a plumber-steamfitter for more than a decade at Ancora
State Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton.
   Mauro, who said the exposure occurred when he ripped out old
insulation, found in 1981 that he had thickening of his chest walls
and calcification of his diaphragm. His doctor wrote that Mauro's
``exposure to asbestos has been significant and there is some
evidence that this exposure may have increased (the) risk of
developing lung cancer.''
   Mauro sued product manufacturers Owens-Corning Fiberglass of
Toledo, Ohio; Pittsburgh-Corning Corp. of Pittsburgh; Keen Corp. of
New York; and Eagle-Picher Industries of Cincinnati, claiming the
companies failed to warn him of the risk.
   The court said that although there is a high probability that
Mauro has an increased risk of cancer, ``there is no evidence ...
of the likelihood that the plaintiff will contract cancer.''
   Mauro's attorney, Gene Locks, did not return telephone calls on
Tuesday. The opinion did not list Mauro's hometown.

   About 300 people attacked a truck convoy under
armed escort bound from Armenia to the ethnically troubled area of
Nagorno-Karabakh and 23 people were injured, Tass said Tuesday.
   The official news agency said the attack occurred Monday in the
Azerbaijani town of Lachin. It said 13 truck drivers, three
soldiers and seven attackers were hurt, with three of the drivers
hospitalized.
   Soldiers and militiamen halted an attempt to close the
Shusha-Agdam road in Stepanakert, the territorial capital, Tass
said.
   Most of Nagorno-Karabakh's people are ethnic Armenians, but the
region has been part of the neighboring Caucasus republic of
Azerbaijan since 1923. Moscow has rebuffed efforts to have it made
part of Soviet Armenia.
   Protests and ethnic violence began more than a year ago.

<HEAD>Report Sees Decline in Arms Spending by Poor Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military spending underwent a sharp decline in
developing countries in the 1985-87 period, reflecting depressed
economic conditions, according to a government report released
Tuesday.
   The report by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said world
military spending reached the $1 trillion mark in 1987 for the
first time but added that the higher level is less a reflection of
increased military spending than of the statistical distortions
created by the declining value of the dollar.
   The report also said:
   _The Soviet Union outspent all other countries in the world in
1987, with military outlays of more than $303 billion. That year
was the last for which comprehensive figures were available. The
study did not take into account recent promises by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to reduce military spending.
   _When the Soviet total is combined with U.S. military spending
of $296 billion, the superpower total exceeded the next largest
spender by more than 8{ to 1 in 1987.
   _France, West Germany and Great Britain assumed the third,
fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in military spending in
1987. Despite constitutional restrictions limiting military
expenditures, Japan moved from 10th to sixth place worldwide.
   _Military spending in the Third World underwent a steady decline
starting in 1985, when there was a 2 percent drop. This was
followed by a 5.8 percent decline in 1986 and 9.1 percent in 1987.
The report attributed the decrease to the depressed economic
conditions in much of the developing world.
   _The spending decline was the sharpest was the Middle East,
where the average outlays were down 12 percent for the 1984-87
period and 15 percent in 1987.
   The ACDA report, published annually, said there were 29.1
million persons in uniform worldwide in 1987, a slight decline from
1986. Fifteen of the 20 largest armed forces were from developing
countries, including China, India, Vietnam, Iraq, Turkey, North
Korea, Iran, South Korea and Pakistan.
   In the area of arms transfers, the report said the Middle East
was by far the largest weapons purchaser, outstripping Europe by
almost 2 to 1 and Latin America by 5 to 1.
   The Soviet Union was the major arms supplier to the Middle East,
accounting 34 percent of the total. Iraq was by far the largest
recipient of Soviet weaponry in the area, acquiring $13.9 billion
in 1987.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Offers to Mediate Deadlocked Iran-Iraq Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze announced Tuesday that Moscow was willing to mediate
deadlocked peace talks between Iran and Iraq, Tehran radio reported.
   Shevardnadze, who left Tehran Tuesday after a two-day visit,
also was quoted as telling Iran's President-elect Hashemi
Rafsanjani that Iraq should withdraw from any Iranian territory it
still holds.
   ``We deeply regret that a group of Iranian and Iraqi people are
held captives, but their release would be impossible before Iraq's
withdrawal from Iranian soil,'' the broadcast, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Shevardnadze as saying. He referred to more than
100,000 prisoners of war held by both sides.
   In a meeting with Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati,
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was willing to exploit good
relations with both Persian Gulf war foes in an effort to further
the talks, according to the broadcast.
   Iran-Iraq peace talks started five days after a U.N.-mediated
cease-fire halted the 8-year war last Aug. 20, but they deadlocked
immediately.
   Further negotiations faltered over Tehran's demand that Iraq
withdraw its troops from 380 square miles of Iranian territory and
Baghdad's insistence that the Shatt Al-Arab waterway should belong
to Iraq. Iran argues that sovereignty over the waterway should be
shared.
   Referring to recently improved bilateral ties, Shevardnadze
said:``Our two countries have opened a new chapter in relations.''
   The radio said Velayati welcomed Shevardnadze's offer to
intercede in the peace talks.
   The Soviets, Iraq's main arms suppliers in the gulf war, are
thought to have leverage with Baghdad.
   Shevardnadze also met Tuesday with Iranian Premier Hussein
Musavi, the radio said.
   During a June trip to Moscow, Rafsanjani signed agreements worth
$6 billion, including an arms agreement.
   Details of the arms deal were not released, but Iran is known to
seeking new weaponry to rebuild its armed forces after the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The Soviets also will help Iran rebuild several key industrial
complexes damaged in the war, construct new power stations and
assist in off-shore oil exploration.
   The deals are to be partly financed through annual exports of
Iranian natural gas to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Discounts HDTV Predictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-definition television is unlikely to be
the salvation of the U.S. electronics industry predicted by its
boosters, according to a report Tuesday that instead pictured HDTV
as a small fish in a big high-technology pond.
   The Congressional Budget Office report said HDTV proponents have
made ``very optimistic'' forecasts about big a market the next
generation of video will gain. The CBO also said that even under
the rosiest forecasts, HDTV sales will be small compared to other
electronic equipment markets.
   The CBO report said it was questionable how quickly consumers
would accept HDTV, which promises images with quality approaching
those of 35mm motion pictures, particularly if there are cheaper
types of advanced TV receivers available.
   It discounted claims that HDTV will drive the technology of the
U.S. electronics industry. The CBO said the total world market for
electronic equipment grew by $54 billion in 1988 to reach $461
billion, and the world market for HDTV receivers and VCRs is
forecast to be less than $30 billion by the year 2010.
   HDTV also will spur only marginal production of sophisticated
memory chips, which are widely used in other applications even now,
the report said.
   For HDTV to add much to chip technology ``would be a case of the
tail wagging the dog,'' the report said.
   Nevertheless, the report said government support of HDTV
research might be justified by reason of increased employment,
national prestige or scientific advancement.
   Written by Philip C. Webre, the report was introduced at a
hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that is
considering a possible government role in fostering the growth of a
U.S. high-definition TV industry. Proponents say a quick government
decision is vital in overcoming the Japanese and European lead in
the HDTV arena.
   Committee Chairman Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the United
States needs to pre-empt foreign competition on the product
invented in this country.
   In other HDTV developments Tuesday:
   _The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gave
voice vote approval to a $305 million authorization bill for the
Commerce Department's new Technology Administration in fiscal 1990.
The bill essentially doubles spending for the department's National
Institute of Standards and Technology and includes $7.5 million for
NIST's internal lab work on advanced TV and $30 million in seed
money to spur industrial-led HDTV consortia.
   The bill was amended to allow foreign companies to participate
in the HDTV research consortia.
   _A House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee approved an
amendment to the NIST authorization bill to provide $100 million
annually for three years for creating public-private consortia for
HDTV development.
   Peter McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries
Association, applauded the CBO report and said it would help shift
the discussion from just HDTV to ``the need to find solutions for
major economy-wide problems of primary importance to national
competitiveness.''
   He said the real impact of HDTV will be on industries in which
the United States already is a leader, such as fiber optic
communications, movie and entertainment creation, transmission and
delivery systems.
   Tom Long, representing the American Electronics Association,
said the CBO report was ``narrowly'' focused on HDTV's potential
use in home TV receivers. Long said HDTV would be a far more
important technology driver in engineering workstations and
personal computers and for development of better manufacturing
techniques.
   The AEA has proposed a package of federal support for HDTV that
would include $1 billion in loans and loan guarantees for
manufacturing facilities and $300 million over three years to
expand the $30 million already allocated to the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency for HDTV research.
   The Bush administration wants to spur HDTV through lower capital
gains taxes, a permanent tax credit on research and possible
antitrust exemption for joint industry ventures.

<HEAD>Florida Judge Denies Conspiracy to Get $150,000 Payoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami
swore before his Senate impeachment committee Tuesday that he had
nothing to do with a conspiracy to obtain a $150,000 payoff in a
Florida racketeering case.
   ``No, Sir,'' Hastings answered when asked by attorney Terence
Anderson of Miami if he had ever participated in such a scheme.
   Hastings, 52, the first black federal judge in Florida history,
is accused of plotting to obtain the bribe, of lying about it to
the 1983 jury that acquitted him and of an unrelated count of
improperly disclosing information obtained from a federal wiretap.
   Impeached by the House last year, he is now before a 12-member
panel gathering evidence before the whole Senate votes on whether
to remove him from the bench and deprive him of his $89,500 annual
salary.
   Besides hearing from Hastings, the committee on Tuesday also
voted 12-0 to move disbarred Washington attorney William Borders a
step closer to being held in contempt and perhaps jailed for
refusing to testify.
   Borders, who spent 33 months in prison after being convicted in
the case, refused twice last week to discuss his part in the
alleged conspiracy, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and other constitutional rights.
   The matter now goes to the full Senate and, if approved, from
there to a court that would be asked to force Borders to testify or
be held in civil contempt and jailed.
   Under questioning from Anderson, Hastings offered an explanation
for one of the key points being used against him. On Sept. 16,
1981, he appeared for dinner at 8 p.m. in the dining room of the
Fontainebleau hotel in Miami.
   A few days earlier, Borders had promised to produce Hastings in
the dining room at that time on that date. The idea was to prove he
could influence the judge and thus encourage a payoff from a man he
believed to be a defendant trying to buy his way out of a
three-year racketeering sentence.
   Actually, he made the remark to an FBI undercover agent wearing
a hidden tape recorder.
   Hastings testified he went to the Fontainebleu that night with a
date because Borders had suggested that he would meet him there. At
the time, Borders was in Las Vegas for a prizefight between Sugar
Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns. Hastings said the failure of Borders
to materialize was not that unusual and that it did not surprise
him.
   Throughout the case, Hastings has maintained that Borders, a
longtime friend and law school classmate, was a ``rainmaker'' who
boasted of influence he did not actually have as a means of
drumming up clients.
   Hastings also offered an explanation for behavior that
prosecutors say suggests an effort to elude the FBI on Oct. 9,
1981, the day that Borders was arrested as he drove out of a
suburban Virginia motel with a garment bag stuffed with cash and
undercover agent H. Paul Rico by his side.
   At the time, Hastings was in the L'Enfant Plaza hotel in
Washington, preparing for a testimonial dinner in honor of Borders,
then a leader in the National Bar Association and, according to a
House report and several witnesses, a figure who wielded influence
at the White House in the late 1970s.
   Told of the Borders arrest, Hastings swiftly left for Florida
and went miles out of his way to Baltimore-Washington International
Airport to catch a plane when Washington's Ntional Airport was only
minutes away.
   ``I went there to get a flight that I thought would get me to
Fort Lauderdale,'' Hastings testified. `` ... I really expected to
see the FBI at the National Airport, the Baltimore airport or Fort
Lauderdale.''
   Agents found him later that night in Miami at a friend's home.

   Mourners packed a church Tuesday to
bid farewell to a 9-year-old girl allegedly stabbed to death by an
escaped mental patient in an act of ``undiluted evil.''
   About 300 people filled the Yalesville United Methodist Church
for Jessica Short's funeral. Among the mourners was the ambulance
crew who tried to save Jessica after she was attacked in front of
her mother and dozens of other witnesses at a crowded street fair.
   ``There is grief and there are tears, but there is also horror
and burning anger at the circumstances of her death,'' the Rev.
Richard Simmons told the mourners. ``What can we do, we all ask?''
   Perhaps God's grace, Simmons said, will ``bring some good things
out of a crime that seems to us like undiluted evil.''
   David Peterson, 37, a mental patient at Connecticut Valley
Hospital in Middletown, was charged with murder. Police, hospital
officials, and state mental health officials have begun
investigations into the circumstances of Peterson's release.
   Police said he picked Jessica at random out of hundreds of
people at a street fair in Middletown on Friday.
   ``I don't think there are any good answers why,'' said Virginia
Towle of Wallingford, a family friend. ``My only answer would be
that this man was terribly sick.''
   Jessica's uncle, Andrew Reynolds, read a short remembrance
written by Jessica's grandmother that described her as a family
peacemaker who was sensitive beyond her years.
   Jessica also was looking forward to her role as an angel in a
summer ballet, the grandmother wrote.
   Outside the church, police officers formed an honor guard, and a
police escort led the procession to In Memoriam Cemetery.

<TEXT>
   Southeast Texas was hit with a deluge of rain _ 8{ inches at one
spot _ from the remnants of Hurricane Chantal and thunderstorms
swept through the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic
Coast on Tuesday.
   Chantal hit southeast Texas on Tuesday morning and weakened to a
tropical storm. At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the storm was 25 miles
north of Houston and moving northwest at 12 mph.
   Maximum sustained winds decreased to 55 mph, with higher gusts
in squalls mainly over the Gulf of Mexico to the south of the
center. The storm was expected to weaken as it moved further inland.
   In addition to strong winds, torrential rains were reported
across southeast Texas. More than 7 inches of rain fell at
Friendswood and Houston Tuesday morning, with 4 inches dumped in
one hour. Clear Lake City was drenched by 8{ inches of rain, while
Galveston received 6\ inches.
   Widespread street flooding was reported throughout Brazoria,
Fort Bend, Galveston and southern Harris Counties in southeast
Texas. Access roads and underpasses on Interstate 45, near
Dickinson, were flooded and several roads were closed. Highway 6
was flooded near Arcola and Sugarland and widespread street
flooding was reported at Rosenburg.
   Flash flood watches were in effect for southeast Texas and the
upper Texas coast, as well as southwest central and southeast
sections of Louisiana. Ten to 15 inches of rain were possible
across parts of eastern Texas, with 3 to 5 inches possible over
parts of central and southern Louisiana.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered Tuesday afternoon from
the southern Plains across the lower Mississippi Valley to the
southern half of the Atlantic Coast. Showers and thunderstorms were
also scattered over western Montana, with showers along the Oregon
Coast.
   A flash-flood watch was posted for the northwest mountains of
Wyoming because of possible heavy rains and flooding of creeks and
streams.
   In southwest Virginia, thunderstorms brought heavy rain through
Christiansburg and Shawsville.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly 7\ inches at Houston, and 4} inches at Ellington
Air Force Base and Galveston, Texas.
   In the northern Plains, however, sunny and hot weather
prevailed. Readings were in the 90s over extreme eastern Montana,
North Dakota and much of South Dakota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Astoria, Ore., to 106 degrees at Needles, Calif.
Tuesday's low in the Lower 48 states was 33 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms
through central and eastern Texas and southeast Oklahoma; scattered
showers and thunderstorms through west Texas, the rest of Oklahoma,
and from the lower Mississippi Valley across Alabama to the south
Atlantic coastal states; scattered showers and thunderstorms from
the northern Pacific Coast to Montana, from central Nebraska across
eastern South Dakota and northwest Iowa to Minnesota, and from
northern New York to western New England; and thunderstorms
scattered from North Dakota to Wyoming.
   Temperatures were forecast in the 70s through northern New
England, the Pacific Northwest and along the California Coast;
between 100 and 110 over the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and
90s throughout the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Dole Hints at Parliamentary Maneuver on S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas on
Tuesday threatened a parliamentary maneuver that could help force
passage of President Bush's savings and loan bailout before
Congress goes on vacation by attaching it to essential legislation.
   A Democratic-controlled House-Senate conference committee last
week voted to send landmark S&amp;L legislation to the full House and
Senate for final action this week.
   But, Bush and congressional Democrats are feuding over the
Democrat-backed financing plan in the package. Bush proposes an
accounting maneuver to exclude $50 billion in S&amp;L spending from the
official budget deficit, while the Democratic plan would send the
deficit soaring over the next three years but not count the S&amp;L
portion against official deficit limits.
   The two sides are deadlocked, with each claiming to have enough
votes to block the plan in the Senate. Under that chamber's rules,
60 of 100 senators must vote to approve either financing plan.
   In a letter to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., Dole said he may move to
attach the S&amp;L legislation, with the Republican financing plan, to
another piece of legislation that must be passed for the government
to continue operating.
   Dole said he may attempt to package the S&amp;L bill with another
bill raising the nation's debt limit above $2.8 trillion. The
administration says unless the debt limit is increased, the
government is in danger of running out of borrowing authority in
mid-August, while Congress is scheduled to leave town on Friday of
this week.
   If the government can't legally borrow money, theoretically it
would be forced to shut down.
   A bill passed by the House and sent to the Senate on Tuesday
would raise the debt limit by $70 billion, enough to keep the
government operating through October.
   Dole said he was responding to a threat by the House to pass the
S&amp;L bill, with the Democratic financing plan, and then recess for a
month. That would leave the Senate with no choice but to accept the
Democratic plan or put off passage of S&amp;L legislation until after
Labor Day.
   ``I strongly object to such a take-it-or-leave-it approach since
this action may delay final passage of the S&amp;L legislation until
September,'' Dole wrote. ``In my view, neither house of Congress
should adjourn until the S&amp;L legislation is completed.''
   On Wednesday, the House Rules Committee is expected to schedule
a House vote on Thursday. The Senate vote would follow on Friday,
the day Congress expects to recess.
   In other S&amp;L news, federal regulators said late Tuesday they
took control of a thrift institution in Lubbock, Texas, bringing
the number under government control to 254 in 33 states.
   The institution, Caprock Savings and Loan Association, had
assets of $457 million and deposits of $414 million in 12,733
accounts. The takeover, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
will not affect depositors.
   The FDIC has been taking over the sickest of the nation's failed
S&amp;Ls since February. The goal is to minimize losses and supervise
operations until Congress approves the funding needed to close or
merge the institutions.

   The United States pressed diplomatic efforts
Tuesday for the release of all American hostages in Lebanon and
hoped that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze could
make headway in that direction on a mission to Iran.
   The immediate concern, U.S. and other diplomatic sources said,
was Joseph J. Cicippio, a 58-year-old university comptroller, whose
execution was threatened after the reported slaying of Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins. The deadline set by Cicippio's captors was
extended 48 hours.
   Intrigued by the reprieve, U.S. officials left open the
possibility it was prompted by Iranian intervention.
   Having no diplomatic ties to Iran, whose surrogates in Lebanon
are believed to be holding eight Americans other than Higgins, the
United States appealed to Saudi Arabia and other Arab governments
as well as the Soviet Union for help.
   During the day President Bush telephoned the Pope and Turkish
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush's strategy was ``to stay alert to opportunities, be constantly
assessing the situation and talk to a lot of people, involve a lot
of people'' to help the hostages.
   In Israel, meanwhile, Ambassador William Brown held a fast-paced
series of meetings with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   ``One of the aims is to find out what Israel plans to do,'' said
a U.S. official. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he denied the
United States was exerting pressure on Israel, whose abduction last
week of Shiite Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two others prompted
Higgins' captors to threaten to hang him unless the three were set
free.
   Brown was under instruction from Washington to find out from the
Israeli government what further steps it planned to take in the
dangerous hostage situation.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
United States had not asked Israel to release Obeid.
   She cited U.S. policy against dealing with or making concessions
to terrorists.
   ``No, we have not because you know our long-standing policy on
hostages and Israel understands the U.S. policy on the matter of
hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Referring to Israel's offer to trade the cleric and the two
others to Hezbolloah for all foreign hostages, including three
Israelis, Ms. Tutwiler again cited U.S. policy, which prohibits
deals with hostage-takers.
   ``Israel, as a sovereign nation, has a different policy,'' she
said.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and others had urged
President Bush on Monday to seek ``some understanding with the
Israelis about future conduct that would endanger the lives of
Americans.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, appeared to
agree that Israel was operating at cross-purposes with the United
States. He said it was ``fair to say that many people do share the
senator's concerns.''
   But a senior U.S. official aboard the U.S. Air Force jet that
carried Secretary of State James A. Baker III home Monday night
from a conference in Paris on Cambodia said Bush and Baker were
``not criticizing Israel for what it did.''
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said ``that's not the
interpretation'' to be given statements by Bush and Baker
criticizing kidnappings in general.
   And Dole, in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor, said, ``A
line has been drawn in the sand. It's not between the United States
and its allies... between the United States and Israel. ... It is a
much clearer and more permanent line _ between those who practice
and profit from terrorism and those who are its victims.''
   Arens, interviewed by CBS News Tuesday night, said, ``I don't
see why anybody in the civilized world that is engaged in the fight
against terrorism would now suggest that this murderer should now
be released or that his apprehension was a mistake.''
   Areans said, ``I think in retrospect we will see that we struck
a very effective blow against terrorism.'' Also, he maintained ``I
don't think there is a wedge between Israel and the United States.''
   In Stockholm, Sweden, the United States asked the Soviet Union
Tuesday to use its influence with Iran to gain the release of
Western hostages. John Kelly, assistant U.S. secretary of state,
was meeting there with Nikolai Kozyrev, a Soviet official, on the
subject of Afghanistan.
   ``We asked the Soviet Union to use its good offices to influence
the Iranian government to bring about their safe and immediate
release,'' Kelly told reporters.
   Shevardnadze was asked before Baker left Paris to use his
influence with the Iranians in behalf of the hostages, all of whom
are believed held by pro-Iranian factions. Other U.S. diplomats
made similar appeals to Soviet officials.
   The Soviets are improving relations with Iran after the death of
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The United States has been
concerned about Soviet willingness to provide military assistance
to Iran and stressed freedom for all foreign hostages should take
priority.
   A diplomatic source said Israeli officials in their talks with
Ambassador Brown were sharing information about the militant Party
of God of which Obeid is a senior leader.
   Israel has offered to release the cleric and the two others if
all foreign hostages are freed. ``The offer still stands,'' said
the source, declining to be identified.
   Asked if the Bush administration was pressuring Israel to
release Obeid or to take some other action, he said ``there is no
such thing.''
   If Higgins was executed _ and U.S. officials viewed the
videotape of his reported hanging __ there is no certainty within
the administration when he was slain. That he might have been
executed weeks or even months ago is one reason U.S. officials are
reluctant to conclude the Israeli abduction of Obeid sealed his
fate.
   Meanwhile, the Israeli embassy issued a seven-point statement
defending its counter-terrorism policy and registering ``shock and
horror'' about the Higgins situation.
   ``In our ongoing struggle against terrorism, we have found the
Hezbollah to be a most bloody, deceitful and extremist terror
organization,'' the statement said. ``So far, they have killed
about 300 Americans, more than 70 Frenchmen and dozens of Israelis.
If it were not for the vigilance of the Israeli Defense Force,
which has repeatedly thwarted their terrorist incursions, many more
innocent lives would have been lost.''

<BYLINE>Dukakis' Hometown to Sue Him in Local Aid Dispute ^By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Add one more lump to the list of hard
knocks Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has endured this year: His own
hometown planned Tuesday to sue his administration over how local
aid is doled out to cities and towns.
   Brookline, an affluent town just outside of Boston, has
faithfully backed Dukakis since his political career began as a
state representative in 1962. But at 9 a.m. Wednesday, attorneys
for the town planned to file a lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court
essentially accusing Dukakis of being unfair to his home town and
scores of others.
   Selectman Chairman Jeffrey Allen, a long-time supporter of
Dukakis, called the move ``painful (and) emotional'' but necessary.
The administration responded icily by saying that the concerns of
all communities would be considered, regardless of who lived there.
   ``It's a very difficult decision for those of us in Brookline to
take,'' Allen said Tuesday.
   ``To get to the point of where we're actually suing the state or
the governor over his actions is a very painful, emotional step for
me to come to but I think he was wrong and I don't think his
actions in changing the local aid formula are legally defensible.''
   The issue of state financial aid to cities and towns for
schools, police and fire protection has been a particularly hot
topic this year. The state's budget troubles _ which many blame on
Dukakis _ have led to sharp reductions in local aid.
   Brookline argues that Dukakis has violated state law by using
one formula to distribute local aid and another to cut it. In
Brookline's case the use of two formulas means that instead of
facing a local aid reduction of $1.1 million, the actual reduction
will be $1.9 million.
   ``We've benefited in good years and if we have to suffer in lean
years we'll do that. What we won't do is suffer disproportionately
with other communities,'' Allen said.
   Dukakis was at a national governor's conference in Chicago
Tuesday and unavailable for comment.
   John Hanson, a fiscal aide to the governor, defended the use of
a different local aid formula designed to favor poorer communities
in cutting grants to cities and towns.
   But he added that the governor has not made a final decision on
whether the controversial formula will even be used. Dukakis has
until Thursday morning to make that decision _ that's when local
aid figures are slated to go out to communities.
   ``The concerns that cities and towns are expressing certainly
weigh into consideration,'' Hanson said. ``I don't think the
concerns of one particular town, whether it's the governor's home
town or not, is particularly relevant at this point.''
   Dukakis last month reduced local aid by $210 million. The use of
a second formula came to light when it was revealed that $100
million of those cuts would be made on a per capita basis instead
of a complicated ``needs basis'' formula by which aid is
distributed.
   Hanson defended the per capita formula, which he said would hurt
the poorest communities least because it avoids cutting local aid
under the same formula as it was given out. That method distributed
most of the money to the neediest communities.
   To cut local aid under the original formula, Hanson said,
``undoes what we've been trying to do for the last six years.''
   When the Legislature overrode the $100 million cut, Dukakis
announced he would withhold the money anyway, using his power to
impound funds. But his fiscal aides said this week he is not bound
to the controversial per capita formula.
   Brookline Town Administrator Richard T. Leary said the town
planned to sue before Dukakis made his decision on the formula
because that's the only way an allegedly unfair distribution of
funds can be prevented. Were the town to wait, he said, the checks,
figuratively, would already be in the mail.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Ogdon, a concert pianist and composer who was
making a comeback after suffering a mental breakdown, died Tuesday
at age 52, his agents said.
   Manygate Management said Ogdon died peacefully after going into
a coma following his admission to London's Charing Cross Hospital
Monday for bronchopneumonia.
   Ogdon developed a vast repertoire of classic and modern music
and composed chamber music, a symphony and a piano concerto.
   A golden future seemed assured when, at 25, Ogdon shared top
place with Soviet pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy in the piano section
of the 1962 Moscow Tchaikovsky International Competition for young
musicians.
   After Ogdon played the Liszt No. 1 Piano Concerto and the
Tchaikovsky No. 1 Piano Concerto the audience rose and demanded he
be awarded first prize.
   Ogdon and Ashkenazy became friends. In 1966, Ashkenazy performed
a new work by Ogdon at the Cheltenham Festival in England. Ogdon
toured the Soviet Union several times and traveled throughout
Europe, the United States, Canada and the Far East.
   Ogdon, whose father had suffered a nervous breakdown, began to
suffer from schizophrenia and manic depression in the late 1960s.
   His hair turned white, he became obese and he had to spend time
in a mental hospital. This year the British Broadcasting Corp.
presented a television program called ``Virtuoso,'' describing his
crippling bouts of mental illness.
   Ogdon began his comeback in 1981. In the past 12 months he
recorded the complete piano works of Sergei Rachmaninoff, several
albums of popular piano pieces and Kaikhosru Sorabji's ``Opus
Clavcicembalisticum.''
   Ogdon's wife had been a fellow student at the Royal Manchester
College of Music. They had a son and daughter.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday his
foreign policy is inextricably linked with his domestic economic
and political reforms.
   His speech was labeled as the first of planned regular reports
to the Supreme Soviet, or legislature.
   Gorbachev reported on such successes as arms control and his
tumultous welcome in West Germany. The Western public, he said,
views Soviet reform with enthusiasm. He implied that without
continuing reform, foreign relations could chill.
   ``Of course, you will agree that there is an unbreakable
connection between the new foreign policy and the internal
perestroika (reconstruction) of the country,'' Gorbachev said.
``All our activities in the international arena are built on this.''
   Gorbachev also praised the United States, saying it has not
increased its military budget for three years. U.S.-made Pershing
missiles in West Germany have been destroyed, he said, and a
moratorium has been imposed on the production of weapons-grade
plutonium and tritium.
   ``It would be wrong to ignore the fact that the West is meeting
us halfway on disarmament problems,'' Gorbachev said.

<HEAD>Union Calls Off Dock Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders on Tuesday called off a 3-week-old
national dock strike that had faltered because more longshoremen
were back on the job than were out on strike.
   About 1,000 returned to work Monday after employers threatened
to fire anyone who stayed out. On Tuesday, employers said 3,727 men
were working, 2,682 remained on strike and 43 of the 60 affected
ports were operating normally.
   The Transport and General Workers' Union called the strike after
the government abolished a guaranteed lifetime employment
arrangement at the 60 ports.
   Members of the union's executive committee voted 18-12 to end
the strike, four days after longshore leaders voted overwhelmingly
to continue and intensify it.
   Ron Todd, secretary-general of the union, said ending the strike
was ``a question of recognizing the realities that are going on
around us.''
   The union said it would continue pressing for reinstatement of
longshoremen who were fired for striking and would bargain for
local agreements to replace the national guaranteed-employment plan.
   Nicholas Finney, director of the National Association of Port
Employers, said: ``This is a profoundly sensible decision which
will save the TGWU's members any further heartache. The industry
can now get on with the task of building a prosperous and
successful industry in partnership, not conflict.''
   Michael Meacher of the opposition Labor Party called the outcome
``proof positive that it is becoming impossible, even with
overwhelming right on your side, to hold a legal strike in
Britain.''
   Curbing the power of unions has been a priority of Margaret
Thatcher, the Conservative Party prime minister.

<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee on Tuesday approved a
bill omitting federal funds for a refurbishing of Vice President
Quayle's official residence, but panel members said the money could
still be put back.
   Four days ago, the House provided $200,000 to remodel the third
floor of the 1894 Victorian mansion. Since shortly after last
fall's election, the Quayles have said the third floor would have
to be renovated to accomodate the family's three children, but they
have repeatedly said the work would be financed privately.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Appropriations
treasury and postal subcommittee, said his panel omitted the money
from a spending bill because he had not received justification for
the work from the administration.
   ``We will surely take care of their needs,'' DeConcini said.
``Just give us a little plan, even on the back of a napkin or
something.''
   The ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Sen. Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, said he had been told by an aide to Quayle that the
failure to request the funds was an oversight.
   ``That's such a different group of occupants than we've had in
the past,'' Domenici said of the Quayle family.
   The lawmakers indicated they expected the money to be approved
either by the full Appropriations Committee or by the Senate,
perhaps later this week.
   The funds would be part of the $18.4 billion measure for the
Treasury Department, postal programs and related purposes for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that the subcommittee approved Tuesday.
   Like the House version, the Senate bill contained a one-year
delay in implementation of Section 89, a portion of the tax code
designed to encourage companies to provide health plans to low-paid
employees. Businesses have complained that complying with the
measure is time-consuming and expensive.
   The three-story mansion at the Naval Observatory grounds on the
``Embassy Row'' section of Massachusetts Avenue in Washington has
been used as official residence for vice presidents since 1975.
When George Bush was vice president, the third floor was used for
storage, Barbara Bush's office, and a maid's bedroom.
   Friends of the Quayles have raised about $200,000 in donations
for the work, according to Denise Balzano, chief of staff to the
vice president's wife, Marilyn.
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Quayle invited members of the House
Appropriations treasury and postal subcommittee to examine the
mansion. Balzano said the invitation was made to keep Congress
informed of the planned work.
   A subcommittee aide visited the mansion and agreed that the work
was needed. The treasury and postal bill approved Friday by the
House included $200,000 for the job.
   ``We didn't plan to put it into this budget,'' Rep. Edward
Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said in an
interview on Monday. ``She called our attention to it.''
   None of the work has been done. Balzano said plans call for the
construction of four bedrooms, a family room, an office for Mrs.
Quayle, three bathrooms and a room for a washer and dryer.
   The first floor of the mansion is used for entertaining, while
the second floor has a master bedroom and a guest room.
   The Quayles' children are Tucker, 15, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne,
10. Currently they sleep elsewhere in the house.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. reaffirmed on Tuesday
he plans to run for re-election in 1990, urged potential
contributors not to give money to his rivals, and discounted any
impact Jesse Jackson might have on the race.
   Barry said he was encouraged by recently released campaign
finance reports which he claimed indicated his opponents have not
been raising as much money as they might.
   ``I'm putting everybody on notice: Those who want to give money
to other candidates, don't give it, because they have to save their
money for me,'' said Barry. ``I would have thought with all the
Barry-bashing, they would have more money. That demonstrates they
are waiting for me.''
   Barry scoffed at suggestions contributors may be waiting to give
to Jackson, who is moving here and has refused to rule out a bid
for mayor.
   As for the impact Jackson might have, Barry said: ``Jesse
Jackson's position on the mayor's race is not relevant to my
plans.''
   Jackson had said previously that he would never oppose Barry,
but refused to reaffirm that statement after Barry said he would
run again.
   John Ray, a member of the District of Columbia Council, reported
raising $218,592 from January to July in his bid for the Democratic
nomination, according to records filed with the city's office of
campaign finance. Former Pepco executive Sharon Pratt Dixon has
raised $100,261, while council Chairman David Clarke registered
$48,875.
   Barry said he would file a campaign finance report in January
but offered no other clues on when he will formally create the
fund-raising arm of his campaign, a first step toward officially
entering the race.
   The mayor also said he felt confident that he could raise the
$1.5 million he estimated it will take to win re-election. He said
he already has commitments in excess of $400,000.

   Divers returned to a capsized oil rig Tuesday
to search for 10 missing crewmen despite 10-foot seas and 43 mph
winds left behind by Hurricane Chantal.
   ``It is not an ideal situation. The seas are still rough.
Visibility is only fair and when those scattered thunderstorms move
through it's very limited,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Pat
Philbin.
   The self-propelled rig Avco 5 was headed to shore with 14 people
aboard early Monday when it capsized about 20 miles off the
Louisiana coast, near Morgan City, Lifa said.
   The rig, leased from Avis Bourg Co. of Folsom, had left a
Chevron worksite because of the threat of Chantal.
   Three survivors were taken aboard the fishing vessel Spar
Royale, and a fourth was taken by helicopter to Grand Isle.
   Officials had hoped to find survivors who might have found air
pockets in the rig's sealed compartments, but 12-foot seas, 70 mph
wind and heavy rain prevented divers from searching.
   Chantal hit land on the east Texas coast Tuesday morning. It
weakened as it headed inland and was downgraded to a tropical storm
before noon.
   The Coast Guard, which had said it would not resume its search
for the missing men, reconsidered Tuesday and dispatched a plane to
conduct a surface search and a ship to accompany the dive boat, the
Sea Level 21, Philbin said.
   A second drilling rig began listing Monday but all five workers
aboard were removed without injury. That rig, owned by Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Marine Inc. of Houston, was located about 15 miles east of
Grand Isle.

   Facing criticism that Israel's abduction of a
Shiite Moslem clergyman endangered foreign hostages, Israeli
officials mounted a counterattack Tuesday and said the action was a
necessary part of the war on terrorism.
   Despite a public show of unity, sources said sharp internal
divisions emerged in Israel's government about the operation in
which Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid was kidnapped from his home in
southern Lebanon on Friday.
   Pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists said Monday they killed one
of the U.S. hostages, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, because
Israel did not release Obeid.
   ``We will see if decisions were taken without thinking about the
results and not taking into account possible developments,'' Israel
TV quoted one legislator as saying.
   The broadcast said opposition to the abduction is increasing but
most legislators were ``observing silence.''
   The television report said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin will
address Parliament Wednesday in response to three motions of
no-confidence submitted by far-left parties over the raid. The
debate will be broadcast live on army radio.
   The decision-making inner Cabinet is set to discuss the raid on
Wednesday.
   To prevent further strains in U.S.-Israel relations, the Foreign
Ministry set up a six-member team to monitor reaction to the
hostage crisis. Several Israeli leaders also appeared on U.S. TV
programs to explain Israel's actions.
   ``I understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in the
United States,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   ``But I think that it is important that we reserve our anger
against those who are responsible for this situation, against the
terrorists of the Hezbollah movement.''
   Arens later said on ``CBS Evening News'' that Obeid ``was a man
who was in charge of terrorist activities for the Hezbollah ... in
southern Lebanon. He is directly responsible for the kidnapping of
Col. Higgins. If Col. Higgins was executed ... he (Obeid) was
directly responsible for the death .... And I don't see why anybody
in the civilized world ... would now suggest that this murderer
should now be released or that his apprehension was a mistake.
   ``I think in retrospect we will see that we struck a very
effective blow against terrorism.''
   Israel's abduction of Obeid prompted indirect criticism from
President Bush, who said all hostage-taking hindered peace efforts
in the Middle East.
   In toughly worded statements after the reported killing, some
members of the U.S. Congress criticized Israel for not coordinating
its actions with the United States in advance and for failing to
anticipate that the abduction would threaten the lives of Americans
held hostage in Lebanon.
   The statements raised concern about Israel's relations with the
United States, which provides $3 billion a year in annual military
and economic aid.
   ``We call upon the American people not to allow this outrage to
drive a wedge between the United States and Israel. Let us stand
together in the fight against terrorism,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Alon Liel.
   Harry Wall, Israel director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, said: ``Israel is in a war, fighting against an enemy
that doesn't play by the norms and rules that the West shares. Put
otherwise, you can't wear kid gloves in a brass-knuckle
neighborhood.''
   Israeli officials disputed that the Obeid kidnap triggered
Higgins' death, saying there were strong indications he was killed
six months to one year earlier in retaliation for the U.S. downing
of an Iranian jetliner.
   They portrayed Obeid as a guerrilla leader in the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, even though some experts characterized
him as more of a propagandist.
   The army said that based on interrogations, Obeid was involved
in car bomb attacks, infiltration attempts and the kidnapping of
Higgins.
   ``He's quite a big fish. He knows and has been telling us a
great deal about Hezbollah terrorist operations,'' Deputy Foreign
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Israeli media said there was behind-the-scene criticism that the
Cabinet failed to consider the possibility that Hezbollah would
retaliate against Western hostages instead of Israel's three
prisoners of war.
   ``It is now clear that in the Cabinet meeting in which the
kidnapping was approved, a script was not presented to the
ministers which took into account the execution of the foreign
hostages in Lebanon,'' Israel radio said.
   Both Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev and Mordechai Gur, a Cabinet
minister without portfolio, disputed the claim, saying all possible
ramifications were taken into account.
   One member of the Cabinet, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the
left-leaning Labor Party, disclosed that he had voted against the
abduction at a Cabinet meeting July 26. The operation was approved
by 11-1.
   Another official said Israel did not anticipate the intensity of
world reaction. ``Perhaps we underestimated the extent of the media
coverage of this crisis,'' he said.

<HEAD>Train Derails; Diesel Tankers Fall Into Lake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diesel fuel spill stretched two miles
over a lake Tuesday after a freight train partially derailed,
sending two 25,000-gallon, fuel-carrying cars crashing down an
embankment, authorities said.
   Burlington Northern Railroad crews were clearing wreckage from
the site four miles north of Whitefish in northwest Montana, where
29 cars of the 100-car train derailed Monday. Several cars,
including the fuel-carrying tankers, went down the 100-foot
embankment into Whitefish Lake. No injuries were reported.
   Burlington spokesman Gus Melonas said the company was using
containment booms to stop the fuel slick from spreading further. It
will take about four days to pump the fuel off, he said.
   Melonas did not know how much fuel had leaked into the lake, a
popular recreation site, but said the tankers were full when the
train derailed.
   Workers were using wooden pegs and other material to slow the
leakage.
   ``They were actually using limbs and whatever they could put
their hands on to plug the holes,'' said Roger Jacobsen, a
Burlington operations manager.
   The spilled fuel covered an area two miles long and nearly a
half-mile wide, said Whitefish City Attorney Tom Muri.
   Gov. Stan Stephens planned to tour the area Wednesday morning.
He declared a state of emergency on Monday.
   The derailment occurred just as the train emerged near the west
shore of the lake. Burlington officials said an empty box car in
the middle of the train derailed before the train entered the area.
It became wedged sideways in a narrow rock cut, like a cork in a
bottle, and cars behind it jackknifed and then popped loose once
they emerged from the cut above the embankment.
   Twenty-one of the cars were empty, Melonas said. Of the eight
remaining cars, five contained diesel fuel and three were carrying
lumber.
   Melonas said officials hoped to reopen the track Wednesday.

   Brush fires raged across northern
Sardinia Tuesday, killing at least three people and forcing the
evacuation of more than a thousand residents of this Italian
island, authorities said.
   Hundreds of firefighters and a dozen helicopters and aircraft
battled the flames that threatened more than 2,500 acres of land in
Sassari province.
   Two charred bodies were found near the village of Bassacutena
and a 12-year-old boy was burned to death in Porto San Paolo, a
seaside resort just south of Olbia.
   Five people were hospitalized in Olbia for burns, including a
42-year-old French woman identified as Anne Richard. She and
another woman were airlifted to Rome for treatment at a burn center.
   Several villages were evacuated, including all 1,200 residents
of the town of Loiri.
   Brush and forest fires are common in the summer in Sardinia,
which has had a severe drought this year. The origin of Tuesday's
fires was not immediately clear, but officials said arson was
suspected.
   Meanwhile, civil defense officials in Rome said six forest fires
were reported in other regions of Italy on Tuesday. No casualties
were reported in those fires.

   A federal jury deliberated for only
three hours Tuesday before finding four people guilty of plotting
to kill six federal witnesses.
   The U.S. District Court jury also found three of the defendants
guilty of plotting an escape from the Cabell County Jail.
   John P. McCoy, 43, of Slaters Branch, Ky., and Robert Nance, 42,
and Vondia Clary, 35, both of Huntington, were found guilty of one
count of conspiracy to kill a federal witness, four counts of
attempting to kill witnesses, one count of conspiracy to escape
from federal custody, among other charges.
   McCoy's son, Kennis ``Kip'' McCoy, 22, of Pike County, Ky., was
found guilty of all the charges except the escape charge and one of
the attempted murder charges.
   ``We're just glad we're finished with all the prosecutions of
John P. McCoy,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Bryant.
   ``What the evidence in these various prosecutions has
demonstrated, and what's remarkable, is the way John P. McCoy
managed to use other people and recruit them into his criminal
schemes, and how many other people have become involved and
subsequently prosecuted and convicted, including his young son.''
   At the time of the plots in March, April and May, John McCoy
faced federal bank robbery, counterfeiting and murder charges.
Nance and Clary had been charged with distributing cocaine.
   Attorneys for three of the defendants declined to comment after
the verdict.
   Joseph Martorella, attorney for Kip McCoy, said he would file a
complaint alleging prosecutorial misconduct. Martorella said
prosecutors brought a witness in at the last minute without
informing him.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II revoked bond for Clary and
Kip McCoy after their convictions. Nance and John McCoy already
were being held without bond.
   In closing arguments earlier Tuesday, defense attorneys ripped
prosecutors' use of a career criminal as star witness. Bryant,
however, called the defendants ``cutthroats'' who would do anything
to escape prosecution.
   ``These are desperate people, each and every one of them,''
Bryant said. ``They were in a desperate situation and they took
desperate actions.''
   In their closing arguments, all four defense attorneys ridiculed
the prosecution's chief witness, Willie Cremeans of Huntington.
   Cremeans, allegedly the triggerman in the would-be killings,
cooperated with authorities and secretly tape recorded several
telephone and personal conversations with the defendants. In
return, prosecutors promised to help Cremeans on a robbery charge.
   ``Willie Cremeans is going to make up any story that will keep
him out of jail,'' said Wright.
   ``Willie Cremeans was a puppet,'' said Flora. ``Willie Cremeans
is the one constant factor here. Willie Cremeans don't want to go
back to prison.''
   Bryant said that if Cremeans had not cooperated with
authorities, several people would be dead.
   ``Thank heavens for Willie Cremeans,'' Bryant said. ``As much as
they've dumped on him in this case, he did the right thing for the
first time in his life.''
   The McCoys contended that they had asked Cremeans to help
investigate the charges against John McCoy. Nance said he plotted
with Cremeans to rob several people, not to kill them. Clary said
she sold an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle to Cremeans but
didn't know what he planned to do with it.
   Bryant called the defenses crazy.
   ``If ever in modern times there is a set of more clear facts,
colder facts presented to a jury in this state, I hope I don't hear
it,'' said Bryant's co-prosecutor, Paul Billups.
   Sentencing for Nance, Clary and Kip McCoy was scheduled for Oct.
10 in Huntington. John McCoy will be sentenced Aug. 14, the same
day he is scheduled to be sentenced on earlier convictions of bank
robbery and killing a federal witness.

   The Soviet legislature on Tuesday raised the

   Officials previously said many elderly Soviets received pensions
as low as $64 a month.
   The official Tass news agency said 30 million people will be

   The higher payments will begin Oct. 1. The first months of the
increase will be financed by a $2 billion donation from the

   Tass said social insurance taxes subsequently will raise an
unspecified amount to cover the increases.

   What remains of the jet engine that is
believed have exploded and led to the crash of a DC-10 in Sioux
City was shipped Tuesday to the plant where the engine was
manufactured, investigators said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators at the
Evendale, Ohio, General Electric plant plan to take the engine
apart and try to determine the sequence of events that led up to
the July 19 crash of United Airlines Flight 232, in which 111
people died.
   NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said the disassembly process would
begin sometime in the next couple weeks.
   The tail-mounted No. 2 engine apparently exploded and flying
pieces severed all three of the airliner's hydraulic systems, which
allow pilots to control the aircraft's altitude and direction.
Without them, the pilot has little control over the airplane.
   Investigators want to determine if something within the engine
malfunctioned or if something entered it from outside, Pollock said.
   The flight crew said the jet lost all of its hydraulic fluid
shortly after the No. 2 engine failed. They struggled to guide the
plane to the Sioux City airport, but one wing dipped and touched
the ground just short of the runway and the jet cartwheeled,
breaking up and bursting into flames.
   The investigation at the cras site at Sioux Gateway Airport was
nearly complete, Pollock said.
   ``The field phase of the investigation will wind down by the end
of the week and disband,'' he said.
   He said one NTSB investigator would remain in Sioux City to
oversee the search for missing engine parts, particularly a fan
assembly from the No. 2 engine that is thought to have fallen in
corn and soybean fields.
   Some pieces of the jet had been recovered near Alta, about 60
miles east of Sioux City.
   Investigators also have reconstructed part of the jet's tail
section and were examining it to determine how pieces of the engine
penetrated the tail and hydraulic lines, Pollock said.
   Pollock said 12 NTSB teams were involved in the investigation.

   A fugitive leader of China's democracy
movement urged Congress on Tuesday to allow Chinese students to
remain in the United States as long as they feel endangered by
returning home.
   Wu'er Kaixi also told admiring members of the Congressional
Human Rights Caucus that ``if China persists in its brutal policy
it is a government which is neither stable nor has a future.''
   He said he supports economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation
against China that do not sacrifice U.S. interests ``nor the
sentiments of the Chinese people.''
   The 21-year-old Beijing Normal University student went
underground and fled China in the wake of the June 3-4 crackdown in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square that left hundreds, perhaps thousands,
dead. He has been named by China as one of the fugitives most
wanted as a leader of the pro-democracy movement.
   Guarded by two Capitol Police officers and speaking Mandarin
through an interpreter, he was treated as something of a hero by
members of the caucus.
   ``God bless you ... You've inspired the entire world,'' Rep.
Charles Bennett, D-Fla., told him.
   Wu'er is on a four-day visit to Washington that is to include
meetings with congressmen, unidentified White House officials and
appearances at seminars and a demonstration outside the Chinese
Embassy.
   He is accompanied by Liu Yan, a leader of hunger strikers in
Tiananmen Square and Shen Tong, a participant with Wuer Kaixi in a
dialogue with Chinese Premier Li Peng before the army's violent
crackdown.
   Wu'er said China has already arrested 120,000 pro-democracy
students in its attempt to stamp out the movement.
   ``One of the greatest worries'' of the more than 40,000 Chinese
studying in the United States is that on return they will be
``subjected to all sorts of harm'' in reprisal for support of the
democracy movement, he said.
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., co-chairman of the caucus, told him
Congress would do ``everything possible'' to enable Chinese
students to remain in the United States so long as they feel
endangered in their homeland.
   Legislation to allow the students to remain after their visas
expire passed the House on Monday, but has yet to pass the Senate.

   A local television personality was found stabbed
to death at the home of a 35-year-old woman, who died of stab
wounds as she was being driven to a hospital, police said Tuesday.
   Larry Sturholm, 46, was a feature reporter for KIRO Television.
He was featured in ``Larry at Large'' reports, which were
light-hearted accounts of life as seen by Sturholm.
   Sturholm had resigned effective Monday and told friends he
intended to pursue interests in writing and video production, said
Kathryn Rich, assistant news director for KIRO.
   A third man injured in the Monday evening incident was admitted
to Harborview Medical Center and was in satisfactory condition.
Police and hospital officials declined to identify the man, who is
48.
   The injured man was being treated for stab wounds to the neck
and was under police guard, said King County police spokesman Cecil
Ray.
   The dead woman was identified as Debra Sweiger of Issaquah, said
King County Medical Investigator Vaughn Van Zant.
   A taped police message about the incident said it was believed
to be the result of a domestic disturbance. Police were
investigating the relationships among the three people.
   Ray said Sweiger had called a female business associate for help
during the stabbing. The associate sent her husband to Sweiger's
house and, when he arrived, Sweiger was outside and a male figure
was moving inside, Ray said.
   Seeing Sweiger's wounds, the man put her in his car and began
driving toward a hospital, Ray said. The man stopped at a house
along the way to call for help and Sweiger died at the residence,
Ray said.
   Officers went to her home and found the dead body of Sturholm
and the injured man in separate rooms.
   KIRO Senior Vice President Al Mladenich thought Sturholm may
have had a business relationship with Steiger, but said the station
was also attempting to piece together what happened.
   ``We're all shocked and saddened,'' Rich said. ``We feel a
tremendous loss. Everyone who worked with him just thought he was
wonderful.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special grand jury was impaneled Tuesday to hear
numerous allegations of safety violations at the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant, including the illegal dumping of hazardous
wastes.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Sherman G. Finesilver told the 23
grand jurors their only task during the 18-month term would be ``to
determine what criminal acts, if any, were committed at Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant.''
   The plant, which manufactures plutonium detonators for nuclear
weapons, is located 16 miles northwest of Denver.
   About 75 FBI agents and special officers from the Environmental
Protection Agency raided the plant on June 6 after a search warrant
was issued on an affidavit containing more than 100 pages of
allegations.
   The affidavit accused Rocky Flats officials and employees of
illegally dumping hazardous wastes into two streams that flow into
water supplies serving four Denver suburbs, illegally operating an
incinerator in a building closed by Department of Energy
inspectors, and altering documents to cover up those alleged
activities.
   Government agents have recovered boxes of documents and numerous
samples of soil and other material at the plant, operated for the
Department of Energy by Rockwell International.
   Since the raid, Gov. Roy Romer and DOE officials reached an
agreement allowing the Colorado Health Department to monitor the
plant more closely than before.
   Finesilver told jurors they had the option to return indictments
or a written report. Twelve jurors must reach agreement on an
indictment before one can be issued, he said.
   Although prosecutors will present the case, ``You are not a
rubber stamp for activities of the U.S. attorney,'' Finesilver
said. ``You must exercise your own, individual judgment.''
   Finesilver also told them they could expect to work about one
week each month until the investigation is concluded.
   Working with U.S. Attorney Mike Norton on the case are Assistant
U.S. Attorney Ken Fimberg of Denver and Peter Murtha, a special
prosecutor in the environmental crime section of the Justice
Department in Washington.

<HEAD>ABA Panel Recommends Privacy for AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Bar Association panel recommended
Tuesday that public health officials rigorously protect the privacy
of AIDS patients, saying confidentiality ``is critical to the
success'' of efforts to stop the spread of the deadly disease.
   The organizations's AIDS coordinating committee said it's
18-month study found discrimination persists against people who
have AIDS or have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus
that is believed to cause the disease.
   The panel said the lack of laws ensuring confidentiality is
``keeping people who believe that they may have been exposed to the
virus from seeking testing and counseling services.''
   ``Confidentiality protections encourage individuals to come
forward for voluntary testing, counseling and research,'' the
committee said.
   The committee recommended federal, state and local laws barring
discrimination against those who suffer from AIDS, both to help
treat the victims and to help advance research for a cure.
   ``Since the AIDS epidemic began, people with AIDS and HIV
infection have experienced discrimination in ... employment,
housing, public accomodations and government services,'' the report
said.
   It added, ``discrimination impairs the country's ability to
limit the spread of the HIV virus by interfering with educational
testing, counseling and health care efforts.''
   Those who oppose confidentiality for AIDS patients argue people
may contract the contagious disease through unwitting contact with
AIDS victims. The debate has been the sharpest in public schools,
where residents of some communities have protested the presence in
the classroom of children who have contracted AIDS or been exposed
to HIV.
   The ABA report said that because AIDS is not spread through
casual contact, students who have been exposed ``should not be
separated'' from classmates, ``except in the rare instance when a
particular child presents a substantial risk of transmitting the
virus in a school setting.''
   The committee also recommended that its members provide more
free legal aid to people infected with HIV.
   The conclusions, which were released in a statement by the ABA,
are to be presented to the organization's annual meeting next week
in Honolulu, where members will decide whether to make the
recommendations formally on behalf of the entire association.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The incurable condition is believed caused by HIV and
is spread through contact with blood or with semen from infected
persons.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department unveiled on Tuesday a
five-year program costing $19.5 billion to correct environmental
and health problems at the nation's atomic weapons plants _ the
first part of a cleanup that officials predict will take 30 years
and cost many billions more.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins provided a blueprint for the
initial phase of the cleanup and restoration plan, acknowledging
``the cost will be high'' and even an optimistic timetable ``passes
much of the burden to the next generation.''
   After a top-level review of the shortcomings in environmental
and health protection measures at the government nuclear
facilities, the department said it proposes to spend $2.4 billion
next fiscal year in correcting the shortcomings.
   After that the annual bill is expected to steadily increase,
peaking at more than $4 billion in both fiscal 1994 and 1995. Over
the span of the cleanup effort which will stretch well into the
next century the cost have been estimated anywhere from $90 billion
to $150 billion.
   The money, which must still be approved by Congress, would be
used to cleanup pollution where federal and state safety laws are
violated, repair faulty equipment and develop new procedures and
technology for future waste disposal, the department said.
   The plan commits the department to develop a cleanup priority
list, containing known contamination and assessing the extend of
yet unknown hazards. The deparment also said it would release
health records of workers at weapons facilities for scientific
evaluation to determine the extent of risk.
   A series of disclosures this year has revealed widespread
neglect of safety and environmental safeguards at the weapons
production plants. A number of facilities, including major weapons
plants in Colorado and Ohio, have been the subject of
investigations by both the Environmental Protection Agency and the
FBI. Some key facilities have had operations shut down because of
safety and environmental problems.
   Watkins also promised more openness on the part of the
department and plant managers with state and federal authorities,
and ``an open dialogue on environmental, health and safety
concerns'' to ease public concern about the operation of the
facilities.
   Watkins, in remarks to the National Press Club, reiterated that
the department's efforts over the years to protect public health
and the environment at the federal nuclear facilities has been
shoddy and in some cases virtually nonexistent.
   ``If we graded for quality control, we wouldn't pass,'' said
Watkins. But he said the answer is not simply ``to fire everybody
and put everybody in jail'' but to correct the operation of the
facilities and establish safe procedures for the future.
   Most of the $19.5 billion will be used at 17 nuclear weapons
plants or related facilities in a dozen states, but some funds also
will be allocated for cleanup efforts at more than 70 other
government nuclear facilities, most of which have long been shut
down, officials said.
   The plan includes more than $4 billion in spending on the
Hanford complex of nuclear facilities in eastern Washington state,
including $2.7 billion to deal with the highly toxic wastes that
have accumulated there since World War II.
   The Hanford cleanup is the most costly during the five-year
period. The department also wants to spend $3.4 billion at the
Savannah River Site in South Carolina, most of that going for
development of an improved waste storage and removal program.
   Other facilities that are earmarked for large portions of the
$19.5 billion are the Oak Ridge Reservation complex in Tennessee,
more than $2.7 billion, and the Idaho National Energy Laboratory,
nearly $2.2 billion.
   Watkins, in a letter to members of Congress, called the
five-year plan ``a major initiative in order to restore public
credibility in the department's ability to operate safely its
unique defense, research and test facilities.''
   Energy Department officials estimated that about $1 billion over
the next five years will be devoted to repairing equipment and
correcting conditions at the facilities to bring them into
compliance with federal and state environment and health laws;
another $9 billion is earmarked for cleaning contaminated sites of
radioactive or otherwise hazardous wastes; and another $9 billion
to develop future waste management operations.
   Watkins acknowledged that the cleanup effort will be difficult
and likely will run into problems not yet foreseen.
   During his remarks, Watkins disclosed that the controversial
Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado came within
hours last Friday of having to shut down for violating federal
environmental laws.
   The problem arose when a number of drums containing radioactive
wastes were found stored in violation of EPA regulations. ``They
were simply situated there (at the plant) and not ... in anybody's
management plan,'' Watkins told reporters.
   He said only hours before the EPA had directed that the plant
would have to shut down because of the violation, an agreement was
reached on how to deal with the drums.
   ``I believe we're now at the point that Rocky Flats can stay on
line,'' said Watkins. ``We now have a plan to deal with these
contaminants.''

<TEXT>
   Japanese gangsters raked in more than $9.3 billion
last year in a mix of legal and illegal businesses, the National
Police Agency said in a report released Tuesday.
   It estimated that Japan's gangsters made about $3.2 billion just
from sales of illegal drugs.
   Gambling, black-marketeering, protection rackets and extortion
were also listed as major operations.
   Income from construction, real estate, financing and other legal
activities also contributed to the haul, the report said.
   The 1988 estimate was nearly $2.2 billion higher than in 1978,
the most recent year available for comparison, said an NPA
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The agency reports annually on gang activity, but estimates gang
income only every 10 years.
   The report said the 86,552 known gangsters as of the end of last
year belonged to 3,197 gangs across the nation. The figures were
roughly equal to those of 1987.
   Police say they can reliably estimate gang membership because of
the Japanese underworld's high profile. It is not uncommon for a
gang to operate from a well-marked office, or to make a list of its
members available to police or the media.
   The report said that while the number of gangsters seems to have
leveled off over the past few years, syndicates are showing a
continued trend of consolidation, increasing their strength by
forming alliances over a wide area.
   Nearly 40 percent of all Japanese gangsters, commonly known as
yakuza, belong to the nation's three largest syndicates _ the
Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawa-kai and Sumiyoshi Rengo-kai _ which have
branches covering most of the country.
   Though their operations are primarily domestic, Japanese gangs
smuggle in drugs and guns from abroad, and are ``believed to be
setting up bases and operating overseas,'' the report said. It did
not specify where, but police have acknowledged yakuza activities
in the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong, and also Guam
and Hawaii.
   Yakuza find their expansion abroad hindered by the lack of large
Japanese-speaking communities, police say.
   The report said an increasing number of foreign gangs are
operating in Japan, often with the consent of the domestic
underworld. It singled out Taiwanese gangsters, known to be an
important source of stimulant drugs, mostly methamphetamines.

<HEAD>Argentina Lifts Restrictions On British Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina lifted restrictions on
British imports Tuesday in what the foreign minister called a
gesture toward better relations between the two countries.
   The government also removed barriers to financing Argentine
exports to Britain.
   Trade with Britain will be treated in the same way as trade with
any other country, Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo said.
   ``This is a gesture in the direction that President Carlos Menem
has signaled,'' Cavallo said.
   Diplomatic relations were severed in April 1982, when Argentina
invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, a British colony since
1833. British forces recaptured the islands off Argentina's
southern coast in a 74-day war.
   Argentines call the islands the Malvinas and claim they
inherited them in 1810 after declaringindependence from Spain.
   Argentina never formally declared an end to hostilities. It has
refused to allow British planes or ships to use Argentine ports, or
to allow British companies to bid on Argentine public projects.
   Britain says it wants to normalize trade relations with
Argentina, negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links
and reduce tension.
   Tuesday's trade development will be conveyed to Britain by the
Brazilian Embassy in London, Argentina's diplomatic representative
there.
   Menem said after taking office on July 8 that he wants to
normalize relations with Britain. Last month, Menem said Argentina
would formally declare an end to hostilities if Britain ended its
150-mile, militarily enforced ``protection zone'' around the
islands.
   ``If Mrs. Thatcher (British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)
doesn't insist on the issue of sovereignty, we won't, either,''
Menem said shortly after taking office.

   The estranged wife of a state lawmaker went to
police Tuesday and confessed to beating him to death with a hammer,
then killed herself in the police station's bathroom, authorities
said.
   The body of Rep. Roland Kotani, 35, was discovered in his rented
Honolulu duplex on Friday.
   The Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office said Kotani had been
struck over the head with a blunt object.
   Grace Sadako Imura-Kotani went to police Monday night to be
interviewed about her husband's death, but was not arrested, said
Maj. Robert Au of the police Criminal Investigation Division.
   ``During the interview she confessed to the murder of
Representative Kotani,'' Au said. ``She asked to use the restroom
and was directed to the women's room ... moments later, she was
dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.''
   Au said the slaying stemmed from a domestic dispute. The Kotanis
were married in 1979 and have a 3-year-old daughter, Mariko. They
separated in February.
   Kotani, a Democrat, was an assistant majority floor leader in
the state House of Representatives.
   He was appointed to the House in 1987 by Gov. John Waihee to
fill a vacancy created when Eloise Tungpalan was appointed to the
state Senate. He was elected in his own right last year, running
unopposed.
   Kotani went to the House after serving as an assistant to the
governor and lieutenant governor.

<HEAD>Planetary Probe Begins to Feel Tug of Neptune's Gravity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mission controllers ordered Voyager 2 to
increase velocity and change direction slightly Tuesday as the
spacecraft began to come under the influence of the gravity tug of
Neptune some 21 million miles away.
   Data that Voyager sent more than 2.7 billion miles back to Earth
confirmed the start of a command sequence to begin a 7{-minute
firing of its thrusters, said a statement from Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The firing had actually begun four hours and two minutes
earlier, the time it took the radio signal to reach Earth from the
distant craft.
   Confirmation of the maneuver's success was not expected until
review of spacecraft telemetry later in the day.
   The maneuver was to boost Voyager's speed by 2.1 mph and nudge
the one-ton spacecraft slightly sideways. JPL said Voyager was
traveling at 42,187 mph.
   Two more corrections are planned to put Voyager on a course to
pass just 3,000 miles above Neptune's northern polar region on Aug.
24.
   Flight engineers also reported that data shows Neptune's
gravitational attraction has slightly but detectably accelerated
Voyager.
   The point at which the planet's gravity began to have an effect
is hard to pinpoint, said Lanny Miller, manager of the Voyager
flight engineering office.
   Voyager ``is always under the influence of the planet's gravity,
but you don't see it in the data until you're real close,'' Miller
said.
   The spacecraft's cameras have thus far been observing the entire
Neptunian system, but on Saturday will begin observing specific
points such as a large dark spot and smaller spots in the
atmosphere.
   The search for moons and ring arcs will also continue. Neptune
was known to have only two moons until Voyager 2 found a third moon
last month.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Florida in 1977, and flew past
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.

<DATELINE>HIGH ISLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Chantal roared ashore
Tuesday on the upper Texas Gulf Coast with 80 mph wind and driving
rain, killing one person and leaving scattered power outages and
flooding but apparently little serious damage.
   The storm was blamed for the death of a man who fell from a
Chevron oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. No
injuries were reported in Texas.
   Thirteen people, including 10 on Tuesday, were plucked from
capsized fishing vessels in the stormy Gulf of Mexico by Coast
Guard helicopter crews. The Coast Guard also sent a patrol boat and
a jet into the storm Tuesday to take water pumps to two shrimp
boats in trouble.
   Up to 15 inches of rain was forecast for parts of eastern Texas,
where many areas remained saturated from Tropical Storm Allison six
weeks ago. Meteorologists said that with rivers and creeks still
high from the earlier heavy rain, residents in low flood-prone
areas should begin taking precautions.
   The hurricane's sustained wind speed never exceeded 80 mph and
decreased to 75 mph as it moved inland.
   About three hours after the storm made landfall at 8 a.m. CDT
Tuesday at High Island, it had weakened further and was downgraded
to a tropical storm. By Tuesday night the storm had been downgraded
to a tropical depression and all warnings had been discontinued.
   But it continued to be a major rainmaker and tornado threat,
although there were no immediate reports of tornadoes.
   At 8 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was located near latitude
30.8 north and longitude 96.4 west, or just north of College
Station, Texas. Maximum sustained winds had decreased to 30 mph.
Also Tuesday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in
Florida were tracking Tropical Storm Dean, which carried top winds
of 50 mph as it churned across the open Atlantic but was not yet
considered a threat to land.
   In Louisiana, flash flood and tornado threats lingered, but more
than 11,000 coastal residents headed back to their homes, unscathed
by their brush with Chantal. Several beachfront homes in Grand Isle
were destroyed, but officials said the small town had missed the
worst.
   About 20 miles off the coast, divers returned to another
capsized Chevron oil rig to search for 10 missing crewmen despite
10-foot seas and 43 mph winds left behind by the hurricane.
   The rig, leased from Avis Bourg Co. of Folsom, had left the
worksite because of the threat of Chantal and capsized on the way.
   The Agriculture Department of Mexico said Tuesday that heavy
rains brought on by Chantal helped put out fires in the Yucatan
Peninsula that have ravaged up to 370,000 acres of jungle during
the past two months.
   Tides at Galveston, Texas, were reported near normal within two
hours of Chantal's landfall.
   The Johnson Space Center was closed when the nearby Clear Lake
area recorded more than 10 inches of rain Tuesday.
   A Galveston shelter housed some 1,000 people for the night, but
it was closed by midday as the worst of the storm passed. Shelters
in Port Arthur and Beaumont were vacant by mid-morning after only
about an inch of rain fell.
   About 30 people spent the night at the high school in High
Island, a lightly populated fishing and resort community midway
between Port Arthur and Galveston.
   ``My house started to move and it's not a mobile home,'' said
Jim Chaney, of nearby Crystal Beach. ``That's about the time we
decided we should be moving along.''
   ``We were real lucky,'' added Donny Jones, who lives near High
Island. His home suffered minor damage when a 60-year-old pecan
tree blew over.
   In Houston, 40 mph wind caused downtown skyscrapers to sway and
creak, but no damage was reported.
   Roofs were blown off a few houses and some utility poles were
blown down along the coast.
   At High Island, barrels rolled along roads and the metal roof of
a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall was shredded. Residents lost power
although the few businesses in town remained open.
   ``We get worse thunderstorms than this,'' said Betty Barrow, a
28-year resident of High Island. ``People are always casual about
these things here. The old-timers don't worry about these things;
they just stay.''
   Lyndon Young of Gilcrest found his house on stilts in good shape
with only minor roof damage, although it was surrounded by water.
   ``By hurricane standards, so far this is pretty minor. If I get
through this without losing my appliances and lawn mower and those
kinds of things, I'll be lucky.''
   Side roads on the Bolivar Peninsula, east of Galveston, remained
under water and people gathered at high spots to wait for the water
to recede.
   ``It's one of the hazards of living down here,'' said Harry
LeJune, who has a mobile home hear the beach. ``But I love it down
here because it's peaceful, quiet, small communities and everybody
knows everybody. If you live on the beach every once in a while you
sort of expect to get flooded out.''

<TEXT>
   Kim Dae-jung, head of South Korea's
leading opposition party, was detained on a court warrant Wednesday
for questioning in connection with a party lawmaker's illegal trip
to communist North Korea.
   Kim and senior party National Assemblyman Moon Tong-hwan were
taken from the headquarters of the Party for Peace and Democracy by
four agents of the the Agency for National Security Planning early
Wednesday.
   The warrant was issued last Thursday after Kim and Moon failed
to comply voluntarily to three summons issued by the agency to
answer questions about a trip north by Suh Kyung-won, 52, a party
lawmaker in jail on charges of espionage.
   Kim and Moon maintained they had nothing to add to the
investigation and charged the government with harasssment and
trying to destroy their party. Suh was expelled from the party
after his trip became public.
   Kim's aides said four agents came to party headquarters and
presented detention orders to Kim and Moon before taking them away.
The aides said the two, notified late Tuesday of the action, did
not resist.
   More than 100 lawmakers and party supporters gathered around Kim
shouting slogans as he and Moon were hustled into two cars.
   ``Disband the NSP!'' they shouted, fists jabbing the air. Kim
smiled and waved as he left in his private car, followed by agents
in other cars.
   Kim and Moon were taken to a downtown police station for
questioning, which party officials said was expected to last until
late Wednesday. The agency has occasionally borrowed interrogation
rooms in the Chungbu Police Station.
   Party spokesman Lee Sang-soo said ``the national security
agency's scheme to suppress and destroy the party has reached the
extreme'' with Kim's detention.
   The agency said it wanted to question Kim and Moon about Suh's
trip to visit North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in August 1988. It
said it wanted to know details of how Suh joined their party and
how he happened to run for the National Assembly on the party's
ticket.
   Suh turned himself into authorities June 25 and was formally
arrested three days later on charges of violating national security
laws for an unauthorized visit to a hostile, communist nation.
Party leaders said they encouraged Suh to turn himself in after the
party belatedly heard about the trip.
   Dozens of people have been questioned and half a dozen people
charged in connection with the Suh case.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying ``these are not easy
days,'' weighed steps for dealing with the hostage crisis in
Lebanon and consulted the Pope on Tuesday as the United States
appealed to Iran, the Soviet Union and other nations to help save
the lives of American captives.
   As White House officials cautioned any military strike might
harm the captives themselves, one administration source said
military action remained ``in the realm of the possible.'' But
another official said that both a hostage rescue operation and a
military strike were ``not attractive options.''
   Bush met for 1{ hours in the Cabinet Room with senior national
security and foreign policy advisers, one day after the reported
hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon and under the
threat that another American, Joseph James Cicippio, would be
executed.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting
was ``primarily informational and assessing the information that we
have (and) knowledge that we would like to have.'' It was Bush's
second meeting in less than 24 hours with top advisers.
   Cicippio's captors extended the deadline for his execution by 48
hours, to Thursday. It was not known if the message to Iran had any
influence on that decision. A deadline set by kidnappers of British
hostage Terry Waite passed with no immediate word from them.
   Although the White House said there was ``no direct
confirmation'' of Higgins' death, Bush made a telephone call to
Pope John Paul II to ask his intercession to seek the return of
Higgins' body as a humanitarian gesture, Fitzwater said.
   The press secretary said the president and the pope, in a
12-minute call, also discussed the situation in Lebanon, the
escalation of the fighting amid intense shelling and the difficulty
of the Arab League's peace efforts.
   Officials said the United States also sent a strongly worded
message to Iran on behalf of the hostages. ``We expect those who
have influence over the hostage takers to exert that influence,''
said one official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   Asked if Iran had intervened to win the 48-hour reprieve for
Cicippio, the official said, ``You could speculate it was perhaps
through Iran's intervention but it could have been through Syria's
intervention or somebody else's intervention or it could have been
none of the above.''
   Fitzwater said, ``We sent all the countries of the region the
same kind of message privately that we sent them publicly.'' He
said there was no special appeal to Iran beyond that. Since the
United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, the
Swiss government serves as a conduit.
   Bush also called Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey. Fitzwater
said Bush's strategy was ``to stay alert to opportunities, be
constantly assessing the situation and talk to a lot of people,
involve a lot of people'' to help the hostages.
   Trying to dispel any notion of a White House gripped by crisis,
Bush went ahead with plans to entertain members of Congress at a
Texas-style barbecue on the White House South Lawn with country
music by the Oak Ridge Boys.
   Alluding to the hostage crisis as he thanked the band and his
guests, Bush said, ``These are not easy days either in the Congress
or in the White House.
   ``There are overwhelming events that concern everybody here,''
Bush said. ``But even though there are complicated times, I think
an evening like this of just plain relaxation with friends is very
significant and very important.'' The audience applauded.
   On Capitol Hill, there was renewed debate about the decision of
the Israeli government to kidnap the Moslem cleric Abdul Karim
Obeid. His seizure last Friday triggered the latest hostage crisis.
   Diplomatic sources said the United States cautioned Israel
against taking any precipitous action that might endanger the
hostages.
   Amid apprehension over the hostages' plight, the United States
pressed a diplomatic campaign for the release of all American
captives in Lebanon, appealing for help from Saudi Arabia and other
Arab governments as well as the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was visiting
Tehran, and other Soviet officials acceded to U.S. requests that
Moscow use its growing influence in Iran on behalf of the hostages.
   Higgins' wife, Robin, said in Washington through a spokeswoman
it was impossible to determine from a videotape released by the
kidnappers whether it was her husband who was shown hanging, bound
and gagged.
   She called on his captors ``to give us proof of his condition. I
want my husband returned home.''
   Fitzwater said the administration was relying largely on press
reports about the hostages, and he called the news ``troublesome
and very discouraging to us as we follow this situation.''
   He said Bush ``has expressed his personal outrage and openly has
talked about the frustration in dealing with this kind of
situation.''
   Other than Higgins, there are eight American hostages held in
Lebanon, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press.
   Stephen Studdert, a senior presidential assistant, said Bush was
concerned ``that every military option ... has with it the
possibility that those sites may be a place where American or, in
the case of Terry Waite, British hostages are held.''
   Studdert said White House chief of staff John Sununu discussed
``the constraints of military options'' at some length during a
morning staff meeting.
   Hinting against any imminent action, Fitzwater said he wanted to
emphasize ``the importance that everyone acknowledges in taking the
time to fully ascertain the facts, to give a thorough assessment of
the situation, to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies
and anyone else who has information on these kinds of issues and to
generally give the matter a very thorough kind of assessment.''
   The crisis ``has not preoccupied the government on a fultime
basis,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere but we do want
to portray one of concern and one in which the government shares
the concern of the American people for its citizens held hostage,''
Fitzwater said.
   Former hostage David Jacobsen said Tuesday that his sources in
London told him American hostage Anderson was to have been released
last Saturday, but that the Israeli action put an end to the talk.
   ``There was enough of a feeling that with the new leader in Iran
that perhaps he might want to reach some kind of accommodation with
the West,'' Jacobsen said.
   Observers in the Middle East and Washington, and Anderson's
sister Peggy Say, said they had heard no report about a pending
release.
   In Congress on Tuesday, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas said, ``Today, I am not happy that one of our closest and
most important allies, Israel, has also struck out alone,
free-lancing, apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to win
the release of some of its citizens held hostage.''
   Dole added that he did not blame Israel for Higgins' apparent
death, saying instead that ``his blood is on the hands of the
assassins.''
   Some White House officials privately expressed irritation at
Israel, but Fitzwater publicly tried to take some of the sting out
of the criticism.
   ``Israel is a strong ally of the United States,'' Fitzwater
said. ``We have an enduring and vibrant relationship and interest
in continuing their security and that certainly has not changed and
will not change.''
   While Israel has offered to swap Obeid for Israeli and American
hostages in Lebanon, Fitzwater said, ``Our policy has been very
clear that we do not negotiate for the release of hostages.''
   Israeli officials insisted that no pressure was being applied by
the United States for Israel to free Obeid.

   Cooler weather allowed firefighters to advance Tuesday on forest
blazes threatening three tiny Idaho towns, and soldiers in
Washington state began hasty training to join the battle against
wildfires in four Western states.
   Fire crews have ``just been holding their own so the lower
temperatures are really going to help things out,'' Boise National
Forest spokeswoman Lynette Davis said.
   But the weather was a mixed blessing. Fire bosses who monitored
up to 2,000 lightning strikes an hour in the fire areas early
Tuesday worried that continued strikes predicted overnight could
ignite a new round of blazes like those that have been burning
since the middle of last week.
   Since July 26, more that 175,000 acres of forest, brush and
grassland have burned in Idaho, California, Washington and Oregon,
according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, the federal
wildfire command post.
   A blaze south of Kelowna, British Columbia, about 50 miles north
of the Washington border, had blackened more than 1,400 acres as it
burned out of control Tuesday. It was among more than 100 new fires
that broke out in British Columbia in a 24-hour period.
   Red-flag warnings for ``dry lightning'' _ strikes unaccompanied
by quenching rain _ were issued for Tuesday in northeast Oregon,
Idaho and western Montana, said fire center spokeswoman Debbie
Shivers.
   The Boise center was directing 20,000 firefighters Tuesday, and
1,200 troops at Ft. Lewis, Wash., began a crash course on using
hand and power tools to cut containment lines around wilderness
blazes. They were to begin heading for the fire lines as early as
Wednesday, said Capt. Martin Eckert, spokesman at Ft. Lewis.
   In Idaho, where 76,000 acres have been blackened, smoke from
fires miles away hung over Boise but no warnings were issued to
stay indoors.
   Hundreds of reinforcements, including National Guard troops and
crews from out of state, were ferried to help crews on the most
critical fire lines in the Payette and Boise national forests.
   Attacks were concentrated south of the small mining town of
Warren, 120 miles north of Boise, which was threatened by a
1,000-acre Whangdoodle Fire, and around Idaho City, a small town 25
miles northeast of Boise.
   Fire bosses began to evacuate Warren on Tuesday, displacing 16
of the town's 36 residents. The evacuees went to McCall, 30 miles
southwest, and the rest were told to be ready to move at a moment's
notice, officials said.
   Yellow Pine, a hamlet of perhaps two dozen permanent residents
near Warren, was cut off by fires burning across both roads into
town, but the settlement wasn't in immediate danger, authorities
said.
   Losses in Lowman, a town of 15 residents largely leveled over
the weekend, were estimated by the state Disaster Services Bureau
Tuesday at $10.3 million.
   Helicopters crisscrossed the Hell's Canyon area near the
Idaho-Oregon border looking for hikers who might be endangered by
the fires. Rangers ferried in by chopper brought maps to direct
about 40 hikers to the safest routes out of the backcountry.
   In Eastern Oregon, where 80,000 acres have burned, the cooler
weather helped slow one big blaze.
   Crews made progress cutting lines around a 10,300-acre fire near
the town of John Day, but firefighters working on blazes around
Baker and Enterprise made little headway.
   ``They'll work like mad today with fairly good condiions to make
as much progress as possible,'' said Suzanne Zachry, spokeswoman
for the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest near Baker. ``They've still
got a lot of work to do.''
   A fast-moving fire southwest of Unity doubled in size overnight,
and authorities evacuated two campgrounds on the south fork of
Burnt River.
   In Washington state, an 850-acre fire burning in the Cascade
range near the Canadian border was 84 percent contained Tuesday,
said Greg Thayer of the U.S. Forest Service.
   In Montana, erratic winds and temperatures in the 100s pushed a
fire in the Custer National Forest to more than 1,200 acres
Tuesday, said Jerry Chapman of the Bureau of Land Management. It
was the largest of several fires burning uncontrolled in the state.
   In California's Sierra Nevada foothills, firefighters on Tuesday
contained a blaze that burned 11,700 acres of brush and grassland
and destroyed seven homes. Arson was blamed for that and a
2,000-acre fire 25 miles away at Balch Camp, but there were no
arrests. Another fire roared through the steep canyons of the
Cleveland National Forest, about 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles,
and blackened 7,000 acres, officals said.

<HEAD>Ambassador-Designate to South Africa Says No New Sanctions Needed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's choice to be ambassador to
South Africa told a Senate committee Tuesday no new sanctions
against South Africa are needed.
   The nominee, career diplomat William Lacy Swing, appeared before
the Foreign relations Committee at the same time as House members
concerned about South Africa met to map strategy for possible
additional sanctions aimed at pressing the South African government
to dismantle its race policies.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill, in the committee chair, said the
committee hoped to act on the nomination by Friday.
   After the meeting of the House group, a congressional source who
spoke on condition that he not be identified said the group was
considering two lines of action: Further U.S. sanctions, or
cooperation with sanctions under the aegis of the United Nations as
proposed by Simon.
   Swing, formerly ambassador to Liberia, told the committee, ``Our
position is that we do not need further sanctions.''
   Asked about United Nations sanctions, he said, ``Were we to be
involved in mandatory U.N. sanctions, clearly we risk the
possibility that we would be hostage to a veto by someone who
didn't share (our) particular assessment of the situation on the
ground in South Africa.''
   At a House Banking international development subcommittee
meeting earlier, a Bush administration spokesman urged that South
Africa get more time to repay at least $8 billion of dollars of
foreign debt that falls due next June. Other witnesses urged that
no delay be allowed unless South African policies are changed.
   ``Some $2.6 billion in unpaid principal remained outstanding to
U.S. financial institutions at the end of March 1989,'' said R.
Richard Newcomb, director of the U.S. Treasurty's Office of Foreign
Aassets Control.
   ``Were this amount to be simply defaulted on by the South
African borrowers because U.S. lending institutions were prevented
by Congress from participating in further reschedulings, the
benefit to the South African economy is evident.''

   Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in
June fell to 2.2 percent, the lowest level in seven years, the
government announced Tuesday.
   The Statistics Bureau of the prime minister's office said the
number of jobholders grew by 1.33 million from a year earlier, the
largest gain in more than 15 years. It brought the total number of
employed to 62.39 million.
   It said there were 1.34 million Japanese without work in the
month, a decrease of 100,000 from a year earlier.
   In May, the unemployment rate was 2.4 percent.
   Japan's economy has continued to expand robustly and rising
domestic demand has spurred many manufacturers to boost production.
   Figures released by the Labor Ministry on Tuesday indicated
there were 134 job offers for every 100 people looking for work.
   Japan's jobless rate would be higher if it were calculated by
U.S. or European methods.
   In Japan, members of the armed forces and people working more
than one hour in the last week of the month _ when data are
tabulated _ are counted as employed. In the United States, military
personnel traditionally are not considered part of the labor force
and those working less than 15 hours a week are considered
unemployed.
   Japan has used its current method to calculate unemployment
since 1953.

<HEAD>DEADLINES AND DENIALS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The group holding American hostage Joseph Cicippio said it had
extended by 48 hours the deadline for his ``execution.'' The
Revolutionary Justice Organization issued a statement saying the
deadline of 6 p.m. Tuesday (11 a.m. EDT) was extended due to
``friendly appeals and sincere behests as well as some special
factors and the moving plea by Cicippio's wife.''
   The group had said Monday that Cicippio would be killed unless
Israel freed captured Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. The statement issued
Tuesday said there would be no further postponement of the deadline.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which on Monday said
it had hanged U.S. Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in retaliation for
Obeid's abduction, denied Tuesday that it had made telephone calls
threatening to kill Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared in January 1987.

   Cicippio's wife, Ilham, made her plea during a news conference
in Beirut. She urged her husband's kidnappers to give him a chance
``to prove to you that he is innocent of all guilt.'' Her husband,
who converted to Islam in 1985, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, while
working for the American University in Beirut.
   In Cicippio's home town of Norristown, Pa., his relatives
reacted with caution to his two-day reprieve, and said they hoped
his captors would free him.
   In Washington, Higgins' wife, Robin, viewed the videotape of the
purported execution of her husband, and said it was impossible to
make a definite determination of whether he was dead or alive. She
called on the captors to ``give us proof.''

<HEAD>U.S. REACTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Bush met for a second day with senior advisers. One
administration source said military action was possible, but
another official said a hostage rescue or a military strike were
``not attractive options.''
   Officials said the United States sent a strongly worded message
to Iran on behalf of the hostages. The administration also appealed
to Saudi Arabia and other Arab governments as well as the Soviet
Union for help in winning the release of all American captives in
Lebanon. Bush telephoned the Pope and the prime minister of Turkey,
and a spokesman said Bush planned to ``talk to a lot of people,
involve a lot of people'' to help the hostages.

<HEAD>ISRAEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Israel insisted it would not free Obeid despite the reported
killing of Higgins and the threats against other hostages. But
officials said Israel remained willing to exchange Obeid and other
Lebanese Shiite prisoners for Israeli soldiers and Western
hostages. The radical Shiite group Hezbollah, of which Obeid is a
spiritual leader, rejected the deal.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed ``deep sorrow'' over
Higgins' reported death. A Foreign Ministry spokesman called on
``the American people not to allow this outrage to drive a wedge
between the United States and Israel.'' In Washington, debate
continued on Capitol Hill about the wisdom of the Israeli decision
to kidnap Obeid.

   Jose Candido de Carvalho, author
of one of Brazil's top-selling novels and a member of the Brazilian
Academy of Letters, died of heart failure Tuesday. He was 74.
   Candido de Carvalho, who recently suffered from respiratory
problems, died at a hospital in neighboring Niteroi.
   The author was best known for his novel ``The Colonel and the
Werewolf,'' which was first published in 1964.
   It was reprinted in four editions and translated into many
languages. It also was made into a feature-length movie in Brazil.
   Born in the city of Campos on Aug. 15, 1914, Candido de Carvalho
studied law and later became a journalist and writer.
   In 1939 he finished his first novel, ``Look to the Sky,
Frederico.''
   After publishing ``The Colonel and the Werewolf,'' Candido de
Carvalho was voted into the Brazilian Pen Club. In 1974 he was
elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters.
   Burial services are scheduled for Wednesday in Rio.

   A slight earthquake rattled the Portland
area Tuesday afternoon, but there were no reports of property
damage or injury.
   The temblor measured 3.9 on the Richter scale and was centered
10 miles below the Lacamas Lake area, just northeast of Camas,
Wash., said Chris Jonientz-Trisler, seismic analyst at the
University of Washington Seismology Lab.
   The quake, reported at 4:25 p.m., was on the borderline between
minor and moderate, Jonientz-Trisler said. She also said there was
one small aftershock, but she had no details on its size.
   Officers with the Portland Police Bureau and Clark County
Sheriff's Department said people called to report the earthquake
but there were no reports of damage.
   ``It was like a sudden jolt like somebody backed into the
building,'' said Bill Wade, who lives near Portland State
University.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage and
one of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. An earthquake
measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Topple Power Pylons, Attack on Refinery Thwarted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels blew up eight more power
pylons, making a total of 30 destroyed since last week and further
reducing service in Lima and other coastal and highland cities,
electric company officials said Tuesday.
   Last Wednesday rebels toppled 22 towers carrying electricity
from Peru's main hydroelectric facility high in the Andes mountains
to coastal cities, cutting power usage by 40 percent. The latest
attacks occurred Monday night.
   Jose Acevedo, spokesman for the state-owned ElectroPeru company,
said 200 workers aided by air force helicopters and personnel were
working to re-establish service.
   Police reported Tuesday that six guerrillas were captured and 29
escaped during a planned attack Sunday on La Pampilla oil refinery
10 miles north of Lima. They said the rebels apparently planned to
blow up oil tanks but security police spotted the guerrillas on a
nearby hill and police and marines were sent in by helicopter.
   After a brief gunfire exchange police seized six guerrillas and
identified them as members of the Maoist Shining Path movement,
officials reported.
   The Shining Path has been waging an insurgency since 1980. The
government says more than 15,000 people have perished in the
fighting.
   The pylon attacks are part of the rebels' strategy of isolating
Lima from the rest of Peru. Guerrills also have blown up railroad
tracks and attacked highways and bridges between the capital and
the agriculture and mining areas in the Andes mountains to the east.
   Power rationing has caused shortages of perishable food,
gasoline and potable water in Lima.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia recalled its ambassador
to the United States because he was unable to stop Congress from
accusing Yugoslavia of human rights abuses, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
   Zivorad Kovacevic, Yugoslavia's envoy in Washington since 1987,
returned to Belgrade on Monday. He served only half the usual
four-year term as ambassador to Washington, said the newspaper
Vjesnik published in Zagreb.
   ``It is no secret that Kovacevic was not viewed favorably by the
political leadership of Serbia,'' the newspaper wrote. Serbia is
the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Kovacevic, a Serb, has come under fire from Serbian politicians
and the republic's press since the U.S. Congress last month passed
two resolutions claiming there were human rights violations in the
strife-torn southern province of Kosovo.
   Hundreds of protesters were given jail sentences following riots
there in February and March by ethnic Albanians protesting
constitutional changes that gave Serbia greater control over the
province's internal affairs.
   At least 238 prominent ethnic Albanian politicians, businessmen
and intellectuals were detained after a state of emergency was
declared in the province.
   Serbian authorities said the measures were necessary to prevent
ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of Kosovo's population,
from aharassing the minority Serbs.
   Although no official reason has been given for Kovacevic's
recall, Vjesnik said it followed Serbian accusations that he had
not done enough ``to make the true situation in Kosovo known in
Washington.''

<HEAD>Twenty People Accounted for Most Renovation Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty people, mostly former officials or
prominent Republicans, were able to snag about a fifth of the
federal funds intended to renovate existing housing for the poor,
according to a report prepared for a Senate committee looking into
the scandals at the Housing and Urban Development Department.
   The 20 were paid more than $5.7 million in consultant fees by
developers who hired them to chase HUD grants, said the study
prepared by the agency's inspector general, Paul Adams.
   Adams' work, prepared at the request of Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., was to be presented at a
committee hearing on Wednesday. A copy was obtained in advance by
The Associated Press.
   While Adams has reported before on the use of consultants in
obtaining funds from HUD, and many names involved have been made
public previously, the current study is the first attempt to
determine the extent and expense of the practice.
   Of projects using consultants, 45 were put in states _ notably,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Nevada and Wyoming _ which would not have
qualified for the funds if HUD's eligibility formulas had been
used, the report said.
   Since October 1983, 51 projects with 7,268 apartments used
consultants, the report found. That accounts for about 20 percent
of all HUD's work in this area during that time.
   Joseph Strauss, a former assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., made nearly $1.7 million _ the most of all the
consultants found by Adams' inquiry.
   Others earning high fees included former Interior Secretary
James Watt, who got $300,000; former HUD Secretary and now U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills, who received $138,445; and Paul
Manafort, a lobbyist and Republican political strategist, who got
$442,000.
   Because of the publicity about HUD, Adams said, five developers
reported not paying consultants' bills in full.
   One of those consultants was Fred Bush, ambassador-designate to
Luxembourg, who has had $45,000 in payments withheld since April.
Bush, who is no relation to the president but was the chief
fund-raiser for his 1988 campaign for the White House, was paid
$215,000 to help land HUD funds for developers who hired him.
   A related study by the General Accounting Office, prepared by
John M. Ols Jr., said developers were willing to pay high fees to
the consultants because the structure and oversight of the HUD
programs made them virtually no-lose propositions.
   ``In this manner developers were able to realize substantial
gains on their limited investments while undertaking very little
risk,'' Ols wrote.

<HEAD>Government Drops Contempt Charges Against Bonanno Because of Senility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has dropped a criminal contempt
charge against Joseph Bonanno because the 85-year-old reputed
ex-mob boss was found to be senile, according to court papers filed
Tuesday.
   The charge stemmed from Bonanno's refusal to testify about the
ruling commission of organized crime in a federal case against
eight men accused of participating in commission rackets. All were
convicted at U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 1986.
   Bonanno served 14 months for civil contempt rather than testify.
Federal prosecutors brought the criminal contempt charge after the
trial ended.
   Bonanno described the commission's formation in his 1983
memoirs, ``A Man of Honor,'' and prosecutors at the commission
trial sought his testimony to help them establish the commission's
existence. He claimed he was too sick to testify.
   Bonanno, a resident of Tuscon, Ariz., was released Oct. 31,
1986, from federal prison in Springfield, Mo., when the government
rested its case in the commission trial and withdrew its subpoena
for his testimony.
   The criminal indictment, brought in November 1986, charged that
he ``willfully disobeyed the court's order to testify'' at a
deposition in Tuscon.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum signed an order
dismissing the criminal charge after prosecutors said in court
papers that two psychiatrists concluded Bonanno suffers from
``senile dementia.''
   Bonanno's book said the commission was established in New York
in 1937 to keep peace among the five Cosa Nostra families operating
in the city. He said he retired in the 1960s.

   Ten Soviet volunteers and their American
counterparts plan to spend August in Washington building homes for
the poor as a return favor for help in earthquake-devastated Soviet
Armenia.
   A group of 20 U.S. and Soviet volunteers spent July in Soviet
Armenia rebuilding homes destroyed by the earthquake, which killed
tens of thousands of people. The Washington stint is the second
part of the exchange program organized by Ploughshares, a
Seattle-based organization of former Peace Corps workers.
   ``I hope they come away with the impression that we are real
human beings, with a better understanding of the fact that America
is not what they see on the satellite or through the news media,''
said Fred Bauman, project manager of the local chapter of Habitat
for Humanity, the Yakima Valley Partners, which is overseeing the
building.
   Plans call for the volunteers to work on two houses in Yakima,
one in Granger and one in Toppenish, Bauman said. Their work will
be supervised by professionals loaned by construction companies in
Yakima and Seattle.
   Bauman said a recipient must purchase the building materials and
provide 500 hours of ``sweat equity'' in exchange for the free
labor.
   A typical new house under the Habitat program costs $18,000 to
$24,000, and can be paid off over 20 years with no interest
payments, he said.
   The Soviets will live at the Campbell Farm, a Presbyterian
retreat center in Wapato, he said. Their participation was arranged
by the Moscow-based Soviet Peace Fund, and the delegation will be
made up of people from 10 different Russian republics, Bauman said.
   Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit Christian organization that
helps build affordable housing for poor families.

<TEXT>
   Michael Harrington, a political theorist and
social reform activist who advised the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
and helped inspire the war on poverty, has died at home after a
long bout with cancer. He was 61.
   Harrington, a professor of political science at Queens College
of the City University of New York and honorary president of the
Socialist International, died Monday night at his home in suburban
Larchmont, the university said in a statement Tuesday.
   Harrington's book, ``The Other America,'' attracted national
attention in the early 1960s. In all he wrote 16 books on the
problems of massive poverty in the midst of affluence and on the
cultural stress associated with technological advance.
   In a 1987 interview with The Associated Press, Harrington
recalled how key individuals, including King and President Kennedy,
made his book a rallying cry for issues they already considered
important.
   ``The luck was that the book came out at a time when there was a
president of the United States who read books, John Kennedy, and he
read it,'' Harrington said. ``It led him to decide to make poverty
an issue in the 1964 campaign. He was killed before he could do it
but that set in motion the process that led Lyndon Johnson to
declare war on poverty.''
   Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation, said of ``The Other
America'':
   ``It was one of the very few times that a book led to a federal
program ... Ever since then there's been a new consciousness that
we should do something about poor people.''
   Harrington's latest book, ``Socialism, Past and Future,'' was
published last month by Arcade Press.
   ``Michael Harrington's intellectual energy, dynamism, and social
commitment enriched an entire generation,'' City University
Chancellor Joseph S. Murphy said in the statement. ``He was the
conscience of America, a champion of the downtrodden and
afflicted.''
   Harrington, who became involved in social reform as a youth, was
on King's advisory committee from 1965-68. He also was active in
the anti-war movement and the movements against apartheid in South
Africa and against American intervention in Central America.
   He was a founder of the Democratic Socialists of America,
serving as national chair and co-chair from 1982 until his death.
   He was secretary of the Socialist International committee, which
drew up a new declaration of principles in 1985. Last month,
Harrington was named honorary president of the Socialist
International at its centennial conference in Stockholm, Sweden.
   He was chair of the Socialist Party from 1968-72 and of the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee from 1973-82. He was also
a member of the Senior Seminar of the U.S. Department of State.
   Harrington taught at the universities of Paris, Illinois,
Michigan and California at Los Angeles as well as at Harvard
University and the National War College.
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, said in a statement: ``More than
any other writer in recent memory, Michael Harrington helped
translate the dry and statistical analysis of poverty into
passionate, human terms, and in so doing he lent moral and
intellectual strength to the notion that government can and should
make the elimination of poverty a primary goal for society.''
   Harrington received his bachelor's degree from Holy Cross
College and attended Yale University Law School. He received a
master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1949.
   Harrington is survived by his wife, Stephanie Gervis Harrington,
and two sons.

   An outraged President Bush is weighing U.S.
options for responding to the ``brutal and tragic'' murder of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins while ruling out negotiations with
Lebanese terrorists threatening to kill more hostages.
   The reported execution of Higgins by Shiite Moslem kidnappers
Monday touched off the first foreign policy crisis of the Bush
administration. It also led the president to pointedly criticize
Israel, whose abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric from Lebanon on
Friday was cited by Higgins' kidnappers in announcing the
American's execution by hanging.
   ``On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostage was not
helpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic
events of today have underscored the validity of that statement,''
Bush said Monday night.
   With Shiite groups in Lebanon threatening to kill more hostages
unless the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, is released, Bush
called on ``all parties who hold hostages in the Middle East to
release them forthwith.''

   Gains made by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in weekend talks with his Soviet and Chinese counterparts
are being overshadowed by the reported execution of an American
hostage in Lebanon.
   Baker returned from Paris on Monday night, indicating he was
pleased that U.S. relations with the Soviet Union had edged up a
few notches and that high-level contacts with China had been
re-established.
   But he was at a loss about how to cope with a resurgence of
terrorism that apparently led to the death of Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, and threatens other American hostages in
Lebanon.
   Apart from denouncing Higgins' kidnappers as ``outrageous and
uncivilized,'' Baker gave no hint that the Bush administration had
yet found an effective strategy for coping with its first major
foreign policy challenge.

140,000 acres in four western states and showed no sign of letting
up.
   World War II-era bombers swooped to treetop level to drop fire
retardant over Idaho's raging fires, and helicopters dumped huge
buckets of water.
   Nearly all of the West's forest firefighting crews were on front

   The nation's governors entered their final day of
a harmonious meeting in which they skirted abortion and other
policy differences and agreed to meet again next month with
President Bush.
   Before heading home today, the governors were to vote on a
series of policy statements, including a cautiously worded one
urging the federal government to reduce the deficit without raising
taxes ``if possible,'' while protecting key domestic spending.
   Other policy matters under consideration included allowing
students and parents to select public schools of their choice
``consistent with desegregation goals,'' and tougher steps against
drug smuggling, including requiring cooperation in anti-drug
efforts for countries to receive U.S. foreign aid.
   Some of the governors headed home early, skipping the last
session. One was Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who said he needed to
deal with forest fires that have become ``totally out of control.''

   After decades of hostility, the Vatican is
seizing on what it calls a new spirit of cooperation by Moscow to
strengthen the Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet bloc.
   Over the past six months, the Vatican has succeeded in naming
new bishops in Lithuania and Czechoslovakia, forging diplomatic
ties with Poland after a 40-year lapse and nailing down a visit by
Pope John Paul II to Hungary.
   And last week, the Vatican named its first bishop in the Soviet
republic of Byelorussia since the aftermath of the Russian
Revolution.
   ``All the steps taken together are very important,'' said a
senior Vatican diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It
is an encouraging picture.''

   U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch, suspected of
spying for the Soviets, sipped grapefruit juice and calmly watched
for 45 minutes as a foreign correspondent showed him videotapes and
clippings of how his story is being told in his native Austria.
   ``I tried and tried, but he said he wouldn't answer questions on
the substance of his case,'' said Robert Weisner, the Washington
correspondent for state-run Austrian television. He said Bloch
looked ``rather surprisingly relaxed'' Monday, as he sipped juice
and watched videotapes of the Bloch story prepared for Austrian
television.
   Bloch also read Austrian newspaper accounts of the case, which
Weisner showed him during Bloch's 45-minute visit to the offices of
Austrian television Monday afternoon in the Georgetown section of
the capital.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department, in its first public statement
on the case, expressed concern that its investigation may have been
hurt by premature disclosure and acknowledged objecting to the
State Department's confirmation of the investigation on July 21.

   Television critics meeting here to preview
the new fall programs had already suffered the indignities of one
stand-up comedian who didn't exhibit much reverence for the
process, Jackie Mason.
   Then it was Richard Lewis' turn.
   Lewis and the new co-executive producer of the ABC sitcom
``Anything But Love,'' Peter Noah, were discussing changes in the
show, which premiered midseason last season and got a pick-up for
the fall.
   One critic asked how many scripts were in hand. Half a dozen,
Noah replied.
   ``So actually,'' countered the critic, ``what you've been
telling us up to this point is that you're going to go in a very
vague sort of a different direction _ but you have a definite
direction in those scripts that do exist?''
   ``Well,'' Noah stammered, ``I don't remember saying it was going
to be vague.''
   ``Like Watergate up here all of a sudden,'' Lewis chimed in. As
Noah continued to try to answer the question, Lewis put his hand
over the microphone and whispered in his ear.
   ``Well, I'm not trying to hide anything,'' Noah said. ``I'd just
rather not, if it's OK ...''
   ``Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz,'' whispered Lewis.
   ``On advice of my counsel,'' said Noah, ``I've been told that _
No, I'd rather not.''
   Noah did reveal, however, many of the changes in the show, which
did well in the ratings last season in a cushy spot behind the hit
``Roseanne'' but won little praise from these same television
critics.
   Lewis, whose angst-ridden stand-up routine was toned down for
his role as magazine writer Marty Gold in ``Anything But Love,''
appeared to be doing basically his own material in the show, which
was, not surprisingly, very funny. But there were problems getting
much comedy mileage out of the other main character, played by
Jamie Lee Curtis.
   In the upcoming season, Curtis' character, Hannah Miller, gets a
change of scene that will hopefully lend itself to more laughs. She
gets a promotion _ from researcher to writer, moves out of her
father's house and in with a female roommate, and she and Marty get
a new boss.
   The tough-talking throwback editor of last season will be
replaced with a new, female editor.
   ``We decided to model that character on a kind of a character
that's very prevalent in the New York publishing world,'' Noah
said. ``One of these kind of high-powered, young executive women.''
   New York performance artist Ann Magnuson has been cast in the
role.
   ``We also thought there was something interesting in having a
boss who was the same age as Jamie and even younger than Richard,''
Noah said.
   Noah said the producers are also bringing in another new
character, played by British actor Joe Maher _ a television critic.
   ``We think there's a fair amount of humor possibly in that kind
of character,'' Noah said.
   The television critics thought it was pretty funny. With any
luck, Noah will be just as cheerful when reviews of the revamped
show come out.

   Elsewhere in television:
   ``DUET'' GOES SOMEWHAT SOLO _ There are big changes ahead for
the Fox Broadcasting Co. comedy, ``Duet,'' originally intended as a
love story between two single people (Mary Page Keller and Matthew
Laurance). The show's supporting characters, a married couple
played by Alison LaPlaca and Chris Lemmon, became more interesting,
especially LaPlaca's materialistic, social-climbing Linda Phillips.
   This fall, the series evolves into ``Open House'' and centers on
Linda as she embarks on a career as a real estate agent. Philip
Charles MacKenzie (``Brothers'') joins the cast as Linda's
archrival in the office. Keller stays as Linda's friend, Laura
Kelly. But Laurance and Jodi Thelen, who played Keller's sister,
are gone.
   LaPlaca said she never expected to be a regular on ``Duet,''
much less star in a new version of the series.
   ``I came on actually as a two-part guest spot when I first came
on the show, and at that time it was to play Richard's (Lemmon's)
wife who probably wasn't any more well-defined than those two guest
spots,'' she told television critics. ``And I think it was the
ninth episode, when we got the script after the taping one night,
and all of a sudden I opened the script and it said, `Linda's
pregnant.' And I went, `What?'''
   LaPlaca said despite her character's scheming nature, audiences
seem to like her. Well, maybe not all of them.
   ``All the guys tell me I'm just like their ex-wife,'' she said.
...
   RYAN MAKES `SMALL SACRIFICES' _ Ryan O'Neal has been added to
the cast of ``Small Sacrifices,'' an ABC television movie that
stars O'Neal's wife Farrah Fawcett, who plays a woman accused of
shooting her three children. O'Neal plays her former lover. It will
be O'Neal and Fawcett's first screen appearance together.

<TEXT>
   To most outsiders Bangkok's largest
slum, Klong Toey, is a repulsive maze of densely packed shacks
tottering over a marsh awash in garbage and other reeking waste.
   ``I've seen a lot of things in my slum,'' 12-year-old Suree
Lokavit wrote recently. ``Some people steal and others brawl. They
inject heroin, sniff glue thinner and smoke marijuana. Many parents
don't have money to send their children to school and many children
simply don't have parents.''
   Researchers bear out her observations.
   Nearly 70 percent of the slum children do not live with their
natural parents, and along with a drug epidemic the slum's 60,000
inhabitants face devastating fires, chemical pollution, eviction
and a new scourge _ AIDS.
   And yet Suree and many of her schoolmates graphically highlight
the good people, the big-heartedness amidst the violence and
poverty of Klong Toey.
   In interviews and school essays, the youngsters told of a warm
sense of belonging to a community not unlike the rural villages
from which their parents migrated in search of a better life.
   ``People of high status live in condominiums. Most poor people
live in slums. I live in a slum,'' wrote fifth grader Rungroj
Sriruang, whose father is a bus driver. ``I walk to school through
stinking garbage and polluted air but I'm used to it now. It's been
that way since I was a small boy.''
   ``Some people look down on slums as low class,'' his essay
concluded. ``But when there is free time we will come together to
share real happiness and fun. Even with the filth and the bad
people, our slum seems like heaven then.''
   After Sirinath Phumsongwon's home burned to the ground three
years ago, she and her family moved next to the pig slaughterhouse
in the slum. This neighborhood is said to have Klong Toey's
toughest kids, the vilest stench and the highest rates of pulmonary
disease. Flies swarm around pools of congealed blood and discarded
entrails from the slaughterhouse.
   Earlier, residents had to wade through the refuse to get to
their homes when the nearby Chao Phraya river rose to inundate the
marshland.
   But the neighborhood decided to take action, Sirinath explained.
Wooden planks, nails and tools were obtained and families worked
together to build a walkway above the fetid water, one that now
connects their patchwork of stilt-raised shanties.
   ``I would like to name this bridge the `Bridge of Generous,
Neighborly Spirit','' she says.
   Meeting Suphawan Ngencharoen is a surprise after reading her
essay, which starkly observes unhappiness in her family and around
her: AIDS spreading from the shared needles of addicts; the
emaciated frames, purplish lips and lost stares of heroin users.
   The bright, willowy 12-year-old girl is dressed in clean, neatly
pressed clothes. Her manners and choice of words are impeccably
polite. Her eyes sparkle.
   When asked about the most distressing moment of her life she
describes running out of her house at night as chemical fumes
swirled into the slum from a nearby explosion and vomitting in an
open field.
   ``The happiest moments of my life are when my daddy and mama
don't fight and we live together happily as a family,'' she said.
   With family turmoil common, Suphawan and her companions seem to
find a womb-like comfort in their school, Samaggi Songkroh, which
many of its more than 300 pupils describe as their second home.
This primary school for slum children is largely subsidized by the
Thai government, aided by the Roman Catholic Church and run by
Sister Somsri, a nun who personally administers a whacking to
errant students after calling in their parents.
   The children arrive at 6 a.m. and often don't return home until
dark. After classes they play musical instruments and engage in
sports.
   ``We can never get rid of them,'' says Rev. Joseph H. Maier
jokingly. ``Some even sleep in the classrooms. And we get all sorts
of tearful sessions: `Why can't my mommy be like my teacher and not
beat and curse me.'''
   ``Father Joe,'' as everyone calls the 49-year-old priest, is
another source of hope and help in Klong Toey, especially for the
young who are the focus of many of his projects.
   After 15 years in the slum the street-smart and compassionate
American knows hundreds by name, life history and prison record. He
comforts prostitutes, puts down thugs with a few well-chosen words
and cajoles parents into sending their children to school. Now he's
working on a father who sends his armless, 7-year-old son into the
streets where he can make more than 100 baht ($4) a day begging.
   Another beacon of the better life is Prateep Ungsongtham, known
as the ``Slum Angel of Bangkok.'' An unassuming, 37-year-old woman
who had the chance to move out of the slums, she stayed to start
schools and fight the eviction of squatters who she charges are
victims of mysterious slum fires, crooked deals and gangster
harassment.
   She and Father Joe maintain that there is less alienation and a
more village-like atmosphere in Klong Toey's ramshackle squalor
than in the massive concrete tenements to which government
officials would like the slum dwellers relocated.
   ``At four or five in the morning darkness, the adults of Klong
Toey leave for work,'' writes Kanitha Thithama. Many labor on
construction sites, their 75 baht ($3) daily wage enabling
entrerpreneurs to profitably fill Bangkok's skyline with office
towers, condominiums and shopping centers.
   There is not much free time. Fathers return late and mothers
frequently supplement incomes by crafting artificial flowers and
shopping baskets or collecting used plastic bags for recycling.
   Kanitha looks forward to the block parties at New Year's and to
Mother's Day and Father's Day when community leaders strictly
admonish everyone not to throw out trash ``so our community is
clean on at least those days of the year.''
   ``The slum is our world,'' Kanitha writes. ``I love it more than
anything.''

<HEAD>Laid-Off Agronomists Successfully Farm Iraq's Desert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KARBALA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Abbass Hamadi and three co-workers
lost their jobs as government agronomists, they went off and did
something that could help Iraq for years to come. They farmed the
desert.
   ``This land is virgin, not barren,'' Hamadi said on his desert
farm where he grows high quality vegetables and fruit. ``It only
needs patience and it will yield.''
   The project got going two years ago, when the state-run poultry
unit where he worked was sold off under a government privatization
program and he and his three friends were laid off.
   He decided to fulfil a long-held dream of acquiring his own farm
and putting his agricultural skills to work. He and the others
leased land in the desert west of this Shiite Moslem holy city
about 65 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq's capital.
   They settled for parcels of desert west of the Euphrates River
because they could not afford to lease productive farmland in more
fertile areas.
   ``I never wavered when they offered me a plot in the desert,''
Hamadi said.
   Using fertilizers liberally to make the sandy, gypsum-filled
soil more productive, the desert farmers have been especially
successful in growing tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelons and potatoes.
   Desert farming had long been considered impractical because of
Iraq's searing summer temperatures, poor soil, the high cost of
transporting produce and the lack of surface water for irrigation.
   Hamadi said his biggest problem in trying to develop the 123
acres he leased from the government was finding water.
   He and his colleagues dug wells, going down as much as 100 feet
to reach an underground reservoir.
   It is one of many deep below the arid surface, fed by
underground channels that carry rainwater from the Najd plateau in
northern Saudi Arabia to the west.
   Now more than 140 farmers are planting about 17,300 acres of
land outside Karbala and a thriving settlement has grown up at the
edge of the desert.
   Hassoun Saleh, who heads the province's agricultural corps, said
the government is trying to encourage farmers to exploit the desert
by providing equipment for digging wells, sprinklers for
irrigation, fertilizers and seeds.
   ``When the farmers need help, we give them scientific
instructions on how to cultivate desert land,'' Saleh said. ``We
prepared all the facilities for making this project a success.''
   United Nations figures indicate that Iraq has more than 13.34
million acres of cultivable land out of a total area of 112.43
million acres.
   With extensive irrigation that could rise to 59.3 million acres,
government experts say.
   But only about 7.4 million acres are now being farmed.
   The irrigation systems used in the central plains north of
Baghdad are thousands of years old.
   Despite heavy government outlays on irrigation projects, the
amount of cropland varies considerably from year to year according
to the rainfall.
   Iraq, which is $60 billion to $70 billion in debt after an
8-year war with Iran, relies heavily on food imports that cost
close to $3 billion a year.
   The United States sells Iraq food valued at more than $1 billion
a year, mostly wheat, rice, corn, vegetable oil, livestock and
dairy produce.
   Australia and the 12-nation European Economic Community also
export farm produce to Iraq, and Cuba provides sugar.
   A decade ago, Iraq had ambitious plans to become self-sufficient
in food production during the 1990s. But officials now say that
productivity on farms has declined because of a labor shortage and
a need for more mechanization.
   About one-third of Iraq's work force are farmers, and
agriculture contributes 20 percent of the country's total output of
goods and services.
   Mendi Sagher, another agronomist who joined the desert project
in 1987, said he believes its success will encourage people to
start desert farming in other regions.
   ``I'm certain many others will follow our example. ... But it
does depend on the kind of facilities provided for the desert
farmers,'' he said.
   Sagher, who built his family a home on his desert farm, said his
tomato harvest this year matched top production levels in the
country's fertile zones.
   He added it should be even higher next year as the soil quality
on his plot improves.

<HEAD>Scientists Report Finding Link in Israel to Speech in Primitive Man</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaelogical finds by a team of American,
French and Israeli professors indicate primitive man may have been
able to do more than grunt, as commonly believed.
   The team has discovered a two-inch bone called a hyoid from a
60,000-year-old skeleton which they believe is a key to the
beginnings of speech in ancient humans.
   ``For the first time it is possible to say from an anatomical
point of view that primitive man could speak,'' said Professor
Baruch Arensberg of Tel Aviv Univerisity, a member of the team
studying the remains found in northern Israel.
   The findings of Arensberg and his team, however, have set off a
debate among scientists and linguists over the origins of speech.
Some dispute the team's conclusions.
   The skeleton of a 30-year-old Neanderthal man discovered at the
Kebara cave near Haifa in northern Israel in 1983 has yielded the
first hyoid bone ever found in primitive man, said Arensberg.
   The U-shaped bone is an integral part of the vocal tract that
lies at the base of the skull in the neck and is linked to the
muscles of the tongue.
   Arensburg, a professor of anatomy who worked on the
archaelogical dig and analyzed the human remains, said the hyoid
bone proves primitive man had the same ability as modern man for
speech, though it does not prove he actually had language.
   Arensberg and a group of nine other professors directed by Ofer
Bar-Yosef of Harvard University and Bernard Vandermeersch of the
University of Bordeaux in France have studied the findings at
Kebara for the past six years.
   Using the hyoid and a jaw fragment from the same skeleton, they
estimated the location of Neanderthal man's vocal tract.
   They first published their conclusions concerning speech and the
hyoid in April in the British scientific journal Nature.
   On July 8, a scientific debate over the hyoid's significance
appeared in the American journal Science News.
   Linguist Phillip Lieberman of Brown Univeristy in Providence,
R.I., was quoted as saying: ``At this point, the Kebara hyoid
doesn't tell us anything about the evolution of speech and
language.''
   Lieberman argued that there is no basis for comparison because
no other hyoids have been found from the ancestors of modern man.
   Arensburg maintained, however, that the hyoid and jaw fragment
demonstrate that the location of the vocal tract in primitive man
and modern man is identical, giving primitive man the ability to
speak.
   Before the discovery, he said, scientists believed the vocal
tract was located higher in the neck as in other primates, which
would have made speech as now known impossible.
   ``My colleagues many years ago claimed that on the day the hyoid
is found, we will understand speech much better,'' Arensberg said.
   But those colleagues were surprised by the Kebara findings
because they contradicted their theory that primitive man could not
speak, he added.
   Anatomist Jeffrey Laitman of New York's Mount Sinai School of
Medicine also disputed the Kebara team's findings. He told Science
News: ``You can't reproduce the position of the entire vocal tract
with just a hyoid bone and a jaw fragment.''
   Anthropoligist Dean Falk of State University of New York at
Albany supports the Kebara findings in the Science News article.
   Through her own reconstruction of Neanderthal man's vocal tract
based on other skeletons, she concluded in 1975 that ancient man
could produce the full range of speech sounds.
   The Kebara man is extraordinary in its completeness, Arensberg
said. The team discovered almost an entire skeleton missing only
the skull and parts of the legs. He was about five-feet-four and
stood erect.
   The Kebara findings also indicate that Neanderthal man lived in
collectives or families, used tools extensively and buried the dead
similarly to modern man, Arensberg said.

<DATELINE>DUXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Couples foxtrot on the hangar floor to
the strains of big-band 1940s hits and a woman in a World War II
uniform chats with a man in a helmet festooned with camouflage
foliage.
   On the tarmac, the moon casts a ghostly glow over a wartime
bomber, and all that is missing is a shout of ``scramble!''
   But there is no stampede to battle stations this hot summer
night. This is 1989, and the time-capsule scene unfolding at this
central England airfield is an exercise in nostalgia for a war that
began 50 years ago.
   Duxford is a war museum, and the dance is to raise money for
restoring a wartime Blenheim bomber. The guests have come in 1940s
clothes, paying 15 pounds ($24) each to eat ``rations'' and dance
to golden oldies played by the RAF Squadronaires.
   A few wear German army uniforms with swastika armbands,
explaining that the costume rental shop was out of British and
American uniforms. No one seems to mind.
   Surprisingly, many of the guests are in their 20s, born long
after the war but enthusiasts all the same, who hanker for what Sir
Winston Churchill called ``their finest hour,'' when the British
stood alone against Adolf Hitler.
   ``I think Britain was a nicer place then. People were more
united,'' said Adam Dzieciolowski, a 24-year-old from Cambridge
wearing a wartime flying jacket.
   John Rae, former headmaster of exclusive Westminster School in
London, said: ``It's a feeling that in peacetime it never is the
same, that we're all moaning at each other, railwaymen on strike,
political strife ... It's harder for young people to get a sense of
purpose in peacetime.''
   With the approach of the 50th anniversary of the Sept. 1, 1939,
outbreak of the war, some schools went to remarkable lengths to
make children aware of the war. Ton Pentre junior school in Wales
recently recreated the war years by having students carry gas masks
for a week, spend a night in a mock air raid shelter, and eat only
the foodstuffs that were rationed in the war.
   ``I think it's good for children to realize that they couldn't
just go into a sweetshop and spend money on sweets, because there
weren't any,'' said head teacher Mair Williams.
   The Imperial War Museum in London has just opened ``The Blitz
Experience,'' a dank air raid shelter in which visitors hear sirens
and shell explosions shake the floor. There are screams, children
whimper, and simulated smoke wafts down a meticulously recreated
bombed-out street.
   It isn't fun, nor meant to be.
   ``I think there is a certain nostalgia for the war, a certain
mythology about certain aspects, the Blitz being one,'' said museum
director Alan Borg. ``It wasn't fun, and one of the aims of our
`Experience' is to show that it must have been a terrifying thing
to live through.''
   Britain was never occupied, and therefore was spared the guilt
that haunts the European countries whose citizens had to choose
between resistance and collaboration.
   ``Our whole psychological experience and memory from 1940
onwards is so totally different from any European country,'' said
historian Correlli Barnett. The nostalgia Britons feel ``would be
unthinkable in any other European country. If you are Frenchman,
how do you romanticize the German occupation ...?''
   For many Britons, 1939-45 has taken on a burnished glow in which
death and deprivation are subordinated to the notion that Britain
was somehow a better place then.
   A clothes store chain, promoting a line of 1940s-style garments,
polled 250 people and found 148 thought that life was better during
the war, that people cared about each other, were less acquisitive,
ate healthier food.
   The war was also a social revolution. With Buckingham Palace as
vulnerable to German bombs as an East End tenement block, class
divisions were bound to narrow. Victorian morality collapsed in the
climate of ``love today, die tomorrow.'' Ordinary Britons came back
from the battlefields feeling they had earned a new deal. They
threw out their wartime hero, Winston Churchill, elected a
socialist government and received a welfare state.
   Historians like Barnett argue it was this costly welfare state,
set up when Britain was exhausted, deep in debt and about to lose
its empire, that accounts for the malaise which has left the nation
lagging behind other European countries.
   ``We had the psychology of the victor, they of the totally
defeated,'' he said. ``They therefore prepared to make fresh
starts, try to work together, find common institutions. The Brits
in 1945 were still dreaming of being a world power looking to the
empire.''

<TEXT>
   In a country where a steak and a
bottle of wine were on practically every table every day, thousands
now eat at soup kitchens or go hungry. In a nation blessed with
natural resources, unemployment and poverty are soaring.
   Middle-class Argentines, among the most affluent in Latin
America at one time, are so strapped now that they are selling off
heirlooms that had been in their families since the days when beef
and grain made Argentina one of the world's wealthiest nations.
   ``This country had no limit,'' said analyst Enrique Zuleta,
looking back on those prosperous times. ``This was the only country
where poor people were fat.''
   Where did Argentina go wrong?
   The most widely accepted explanation is the collapse of the
state-dominated economic system laid down by Juan D. Peron in late
1940s, when Argentina's treasury was filled with gold.
   Now it is in the hands of his successors in the Peronist
movement to rescue the nation.
   ``The problem is very clear to us,'' says Sen. Carlos Tenev of
the governing Peronist Party, which now is trying to sell companies
it nationalized in the early days of Peron. ``The state is very
weak, geriatric. The productive apparatus is totally wasted.''
   Warning lights already were blinking when middle class
Argentines flew to beaches in Brazil for summer vacations last
January and February. The fiscal deficit was soaring, the austral
currency was tremendously overvalued, foreign currency reserves
were running low.
   But such things have happened often in recent years and the
significance was dismissed. What was in store for Argentines turned
out to be even worse than the Depression of the 1930s.
   When the Central Bank on Feb. 6 stopped selling U.S. dollars,
Argentines frantically bid up the price at exchange houses. In six
months, the austral lost 97 percent of its value. Inflation doubled
and then doubled again. In July it was running at a monthly rate of
at least 200 percent.
   Real wages contracted by one-half. Unemployment unofficially
stands at a record 14 percent. An estimated one in four Argentina's
31 million people lives in poverty; 820,000 people in Buenos Aires
Province alone eat at least one meal a day at some 1,500 soup
kitchens that have opened, according to Gov. Antonio Cafiero.
   In late May, lootings of food stores nationwide prompted the
government, then headed by President Raul Alfonsin, to declare a
state of siege and suspend civil liberties for one month. While
there have been no major clashes with police since, sackings and
arrests have continued.
   Few Argentines had seen anything like this before.
   ``I don't think anyone thought things would collapse so
quickly,'' said Angel Pena, an economist with the Mediterranean
Foundation research group. And the bottom, he said, may not have
been reached.
   Economic collapse was waiting to happen.
   Annual inflation has been triple-digit in 14 of the past 15
years. The national budget usually is severely in deficit. The
gross national product has remained in stagnation at about $80
billion. The informal economy has blossomed. Private Argentine
money stashed in safer havens abroad may total $30 billion.
   ``The country was starved of resources,'' said Marcos Victorica,
director of the Institute of Contemporary Studies. ``It paid its
expenses by printing money until inflation got out of hand.''
   Payments haven't been made in 15 months on the foreign debt of
$64 billion, the third-highest among developing countries.
Maintenance on thermal electricity plants lagged so badly that a
drought touched off an energy shortage that has lasted since
December, the start of the Southern Hemisphere's summer.
   ``The government stopped capital expenditure, stopped research,
stopped maintenance,'' said Diana Mondino, a professor at the
Argentine Center for Macroeconomic Studies, a business school.
``The government just stared at what was going on, wondering what
to do.''
   President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, cannot defer
hard choices by borrowing abroad or waiting things out, as did
Alfonsin, his predecessor. In his first week as president, Menem
increased state-controlled transport, telephone, electricity and
gas rates by 200 to 600 percent.
   A gallon of gas jumped immediately to the austral equivalent of
$1.65 from 23 cents, while average monthly incomes remained in the
$40 to $200 range.
   Noticeably fewer cars were on Buenos Aires' broad boulevards and
cobblestone sidestreets.
   ``It looks like Saturday,'' a taxi driver said on a recent
weekday morning.
   Most people can't afford taxis, either: fares have soared
sixfold.
   Similar increases in the prices of food, cigarettes, movie
tickets and clothes have produced waves of shock, anxiety,
frustration and resignation among Argentines, particularly the
middle class.

   ``People come in and talk about their problems, their illusions,
their fears, their conflicts,'' said Roger Montenegro, president of
the Argentine Psychiatric Association. ``In the last couple of
months, the economy theme comes up almost obsessively.''
   His colleagues, Montenegro noted, charged the equivalent of $25
to $40 an hour three months ago. Now, they're lucky to get $5.
   ``Everyone is pauperized,'' he said.
   Said Flavio Chiari, a 21-year-old employee at a foreign exchange
house: ``A year ago, you could invite a bunch of friends over for a
cookout. No problem. Now, to do that everyone has to bring
something.''
   That's because food prices have risen so rapidly. A kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of beefsteak cost 500 australes (76 cents) at the
beginning of July and rose to 1,000 australes ($1.53) by the end of
the month.
   In the same period, a quart of milk doubled to 120 australes (18
cents) and a loaf of bread increased by 100 percent to 280
australes (43 cents).
   The price increases come in sudden jumps. The cheapest pack of
cigarettes doubled in one day to 420 australes (64 cents).
   And increases have been coming that way for months. A movie
ticket that cost 25 australes in February now costs 700. A pair of
leather mocassins that cost 770 australes in February now cost
19,000.
   Hardship and gloom obscure the fact that Argentina as recently
as the 1920s had a per capita income on a par with Switzerland's.
Buenos Aires put in a subway system, just after New York City did.
   Argentina still is potentially rich. The flat, fertile pampas
continue to produce huge surpluses of grain and beef. Argentina is
nearly self-sufficient in oil and has vast natural gas reserves.
Fisheries in the South Atlantic are virtually untapped.
   Argentina's climate is temperate and most of its citizens share
a common European ancestry, the same language, race and Roman
Catholic religion.
   Zuleta, the analyst who also is a pollster, sees Argentina's
problem as political, not economic, however. Schisms _ often
violent, sometimes bloody _ between and within labor unions,
businesses, political parties and the armed forces, which have
overthrown six governments since 1930, are the real problem, he
maintains.
   ``The political failure is the key to understanding
everything,'' he said. ``It's not just a rich country that is badly
administered. It's badly administered because of political
ideology.''
   The ideology may be shifting. The crisis has undermined
cherished beliefs that the state should provide services, education
and jobs.
   ``All of us together will cure Argentina or Argentina will
die,'' Menem said in his inaugural address. ``This is the cruel
choice.''
   In his first two weeks, Menem forged alliances with rival
political parties, reached out to business and farm groups whose
members probably did not vote for him and took steps to resolve a
military impasse that sparked three barracks revolts against
Alfonsin.
   On the theme of the state-directed economy that is a legacy of
his party's founder, Juan Peron, president in 1946-55 and 1973-74,
Menem says, ``We want a state that allows the nation to live, that
is its servant and not its jailer.''
   So far, Menem's solution is much like Alfonsin's: raise utility
rates but also salaries, reduce government expenditures and
increase tax revenues.
   The new elements are Menem's plan to sell state companies whose
operating losses contribute to the fiscal deficit and the
suspension or elimination of subsidies to private businesses that
cost the government billions of dollars a year.
   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to do both. Quick
approval is likely, though the first privatizations may not be seen
for a year or more.
   Jose Luis Manzano, president of the Peronist bloc in the lower
house of Congress, said Menem is racing against the clock.
Argentines who can barely pay heating, electricity and telephone
bills won't wait long for things to get better.
   How long?
   ``Three months,'' Manzano replied.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Leslie Craske is worried.
A crack in the north aisle of his 14th century church has traveled
up to the apex and down the other side. Outside, two large graves
show signs of collapsing.
   The Church of England minister suspects the church and grounds
may be sinking into a network of munition and rail tunnels the
Nazis dug under the church during World War II.
   The problem is not unusual in Guernsey, one of Britain's Channel
Islands off the coast of France. Using foreign slave labor, the
Germans dug 41 tunnels on the 25-square-mile island.
   The tunnels are the war's most troublesome legacy in the Channel
Islands, the only British soil occupied by the Germans.
   In May, the government evacuated two elderly couples from
state-owned rental houses because a tunnel underneath was crumbling
slightly.
   ``We're not taking any chances,'' said Brian Castle, the
islands' housing administrator.
   A couple of years ago, a bowling green collapsed overnight in
Delancey Park. Before that, a garden fell in Fort George. Every now
and then a field will subside, and the lawn in front of the St.
Saviour's rectory undulates because of air raid shelters below.
   ``The Germans just tunneled like rabbits,'' said Gerald
Przenislawski, who operates La Valette Underground Military Museum.
``There will always be a problem as long as they (the tunnels) are
there.''
   The Channel Islands were occupied from June 30, 1940, to May 9,
1945, and were among the last places in Europe to be liberated.
   ``There's quite a bit that the occupation left,'' Castle said.
   Constant reminders are the unsightly German fortifications and
the cemetery for German soldiers. And there are the descendants of
Germans who came back after the war and married Guernsey women.
   Guernsey's young brought back a variety of accents from England,
where they were evacuated during the occupation. For many, there is
still pain from having spent such a large chunk of life apart.
   ``I got one Red Cross message from my parents'' during the
entire five years, recalls Roydon Falla, a politician.
   But not all memories are bitter.
   Owen Le Vallee, president of the Liberation Day Committee, said
his mother found a starving German in the outhouse during the year
after D-Day, the 1944 Allied invasion of Europe.
   ``Mother felt a great deal of compassion for him and gave him
some food, the little that she had,'' Le Vallee said.
   At St. Saviour's parish, Craske frets. ``We have an impression
that the crack is lengthening,'' the minister said.
   Pointing to the large graves, which date back to 1860, he said:
``They buried whole generations in these. You've got as many as 24
bodies piled one on top of the other.''
   The parish's 2,300 taxpayers are responsible for the church.
   ``In Guernsey law, everything that is under your ground is
yours, which is not a comforting thought as far as this is
concerned,'' Craske said of the tunnels.
   ``We don't know whether it will be five years or five centuries.
Ultimately, they will collapse,'' he said. ``They are bound to.''

   Five former officials of Princeton-Newport
Partners LP and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader were
convicted in the first case using tough federal racketeering laws
against Wall Street professionals.
   The convictions Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on
charges of racketeering, conspiracy and fraud charges marked a
stunning victory for the government in its three-year crackdown on
white-collar securities crime.
   A federal jury deliberated 2{ days before returning guilty
verdicts on all but one count in the 64-count indictment. Jurors
acquitted two defendants, former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg
and former Princeton-Newport partner Charles M. Zarzecki, of one
count of wire fraud.

   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home fell in June to its lowest level in
three years, reflecting rising mortgage rates and higher home
prices, a real estate trade group said.
   The National Association of Realtors said Monday that for the
first time since March 1986, its housing affordability index showed
that a typical American family did not have enough money to buy a
median-priced home.
   The index dropped to 99.3 percent in June, down from 100.7
percent in May. That means that a family earning the national
median of $32,760 a year had 99.3 percent of the funds needed to
qualify for conventional financing covering 80 percent of the
purchase price of a home costing a median price of $93,200.
   The decline in affordability in June was blamed on an increase
in mortgage rates and a $600 increase in the median resale price of
a home. Mortgage rates at closing climbed to 10.59 percent in June,
up from a nationwide average of 10.46 percent in May. The
association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   Officials noted that, since June, mortgage rates have begun
declining in response to credit-easing moves on the part of the
Federal Reserve and home prices have begun moderating as well.
   ``Lower mortgage rates and price moderation in many areas will
help people who can make a down payment. But, in high-cost areas,
the entry-level buyer is still going to be priced out,'' said Ira
Gribin, president of the Realtors group.

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.54

   American Express Co. will sell the last of its
common stock in Fireman's Fund Corp. back to the company for $342
million in securities, the companies said.
   American Express said Monday the transaction represented its
exit from the property and casualty insurance business, which it

insurance, a business it entered through Fireman's Fund.

preferred stock in 1968 and began selling it piece by piece in
1985. The sale of the final 15 percent brings total proceeds of the
sale to $1.8 billion, the company said.
   Fireman's Fund is paying for the stock purchase by issuing a
special class of voting preferred stock to American Express. There
are no restrictions on American Express' ability to trade the
preferred shares, which are redeemable after seven years.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Still at High Level</HEAD>

   Consumer confidence increased in July despite
indications of sluggish economic activity, a research group
reported.
   The Conference Board said Monday its consumer confidence index
rose 3.5 points during the month to 120.7.
   ``The continued high level of consumer confidence despite signs
that the economy may be slowing can be attributed to the strength
of the particular economic circumstances which affect daily life of
the average citizen,'' said Fabian Linden, executive director of
the board's consumer research center.
   ``Unemployment has been hovering around 5 percent and we are
generating about 200,000 new jobs a month,'' he said. ``Declining
interest rates and the inflation rate, which is fluctuating between
modest and barely visible, also contribute to the consumer's sense
of security.''
   Based on a monthly survey of about 5,000 households, the board
said consumers expressed considerable satisfaction with present
business conditions and slightly fewer people believe the current
climate is bad.
   The survey found 31.8 percent of those responding thought
business conditions were good, up from 28.3 percent in the survey a
month earlier. There was a drop of 2 percent in the number of
people who termed conditions as bad.
   People continued to be positive about the employment situation
and a third of all the survey respondents said jobs were plentiful.
In the July survey, 18.6 percent of those participating said that
more job opportunities will become available in the months ahead,
up from 17.9 percent in the June poll.
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit research organization
supported by companies, trade and professional groups, government
agencies, labor unions, schools, libraries and individuals.
   Its monthly survey of households is conducted by National Family
Opinion of Toledo, Ohio.

<HEAD>$450 Million Paper Machine Planned for Western Maine Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUMFORD, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. has unveiled a plan to
install one of the world's largest paper machines at its mill in
this Androscoggin River town, a $450 million project that will
continue the mill's two-decade trend toward a smaller work force.
   The new machine, with an annual capacity of 318,000 tons, will
be the centerpiece of a $770 million modernization program designed
to turn one of the nation's oldest pulp and paper mills into one of
the largest and most productive manufacturers of coated papers for
catalogs and magazines, the Boise, Idaho-based company said Monday.
   Coated paper from the mill in western Maine is used in such
publications as Time, National Geographic, People and Vanity Fair
as well as such catalogs as L.L. Bean, Horchow and Macy's, Baxter
said.
   The company said it expects to begin installing the machine and
building related facilities in 1991, with a start-up of production
planned for late 1993.
   The new machine will lead to an unspecified reduction in the
1,600-member work force at the Rumford mill, according to Eric S.
Baxter, spokesman at the offices of Boise Cascade's coated paper
division in Portland.
   ``We'll be shutting down four very old machines to make way for
the new machine,'' said Baxter. He said there will be no layoffs
and all job losses will be carried out through attrition.
   The president of Local 900 of the United Paperworkers
International Union, which represents some 1,250 production workers
at Boise Cascade, declined comment on the merits of the project but
expressed surprise that it was announced at this time.
   ``They (management) told us about a month ago that it was being
put on hold for at least nine months to a year before it was going
to be announced. Now, they go ahead and announce it,'' Don Barker
said.
   Barker, whose union was involved in a violent strike at Boise
Cascade three years ago, noted that the mill had more than 3,000
workers before automation began to shrink the number of jobs.
   Built around the turn of the century at a bend in the
Androscoggin River, the mill has produced both coated and uncoated
papers. When the new machine is installed, production will rise to
753,000 tons a year and be made up entirely of coated papers, the
company said.
   The project hinges on obtaining state and federal environmental
permits to install and operate the machine.
   Other elements of Boise Cascade's modernization include:
   _ A $180 million power generation project to be completed next
year that will eliminate the need for 600,000 barrels of oil a year
and reduce particulate emissions by 50 percent.
   _ A $75 million pulp mill expansion project that will increase
pulp production capacity by 212 tons a day, or 25 percent.
   _ A $52 million complete rebuilding of one paper machine and a
$12 million enhancement of another machine.

<HEAD>House Votes to Clamp Down on Misleading Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved a bill to clamp down on
private businesses and others who attempt to mislead consumers by
designing their mailings to look like U.S. government documents.
   The bill, passed by voice vote Monday and sent to the Senate,
would require such mass-mail solicitations to have on the envelope
or wrapper: ``THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT.''
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., said the bill was needed to
``protect the consumer, especially because many of these deceptive
mailings appear to be targeted at the elderly and other vulnerable
groups.''
   He cited the case of one group which has been attracting elderly
people to pay it a fee for helping them sign up for Social
Security, something that's done for free by government employees.

<HEAD>Consumer And Business Borrowing Costs Should Drop Further</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer and business borrowing expenses should
head down even further now that major commercial banks have lowered
their prime lending rate a half percentage point to 10.5 percent.
   The reduction, announced Monday, had been called long overdue by
many economists since most other interest rates had dropped as
economic growth continues to slow down.
   It followed an identical rate reduction three weeks ago by Chase
Manhattan Bank. But aside from a few smaller banks, only Bank of
America, which lowered its prime Friday, had taken Chase's cue.
   ``Banks view cutting the prime rate the way most of us view a
trip to the dentist ... but they know that sooner or later they
have to,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko
Securities Co. International.
   Economists speculated the big banks didn't immediately follow
Chase's July 10 rate cut partly because they wanted to determine
whether the Federal Reserve would keep pursuing lower interest
rates as it had recently to prevent the economy from falling into a
recession.
   ``The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too early
and everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed
below 9 percent,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist with
Dean Wittter Reynolds Inc. ``But they could have easily done that
by the end of last week.''
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8 15-16 percent late Monday, unchanged from
Friday. The Fed controls the key rate by adding or subtracting
banking reserves.
   Other interest rates in the credit markets have been falling
steadily. The yield on the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond was
7.91 percent late Monday, down from a 7.98 percent close on Friday
that marked the first finish below 8 percent since spring 1987.
Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages also have fallen, dropping below
10 percent over the past few weeks.
   Meanwhile, rates on savings accounts have slipped, with the
average yield on a six-month certificate of deposit down to 8.47
percent last week from 8.52 percent the previous week, according to
the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor.
   The prime reflects a bank's cost of money, such as the interest
it pays on savings accounts or CDs, and therefore generally trails
more subtle changes in other rates.
   As a result of Monday's concerted rate-lowering action,
borrowing costs for some consumers and businesses are expected to
decline more broadly because the prime is used as a basis for
calculating many fixed and adjustable-rate loans, such as credit
card rates and home equity loans.
   Bond and stock prices rose following Monday's action, which
began with an announcement by First Bank of Chicago shortly before
the stock market opened. Other big banks quickly followed suit,
including Citibank, the nation's largest.
   F. Ward McCarthy, a principal at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., said banks had been reluctant to cut their prime
before Monday because business had been sluggish.
   ``When the economy is slowing down, loan demand slows down.
Banks try to bolster revenue ... by keeping their lending rates
up,'' McCarthy said.
   The government reported last week that the economy expanded at a
rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, the slowest rate in
three years.
   McCarthy and other economists said interest rates should
continue to fall through the end of the year, with some predicting
rates would fall far enough to push the prime below 10 percent.
   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. It was
raised twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a half
percentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changing
perceptions about economic growth and inflation.

<HEAD>House Approves Delay in Installing Airline Safety Gear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has heeded pleas by the aviation
industry and agreed to let the government push back the deadline
for installation of an anti-collision device on airliners by at
least two years.
   On a unanimous voice vote Monday, lawmakers passed legislation
allowing the Federal Aviation Administration to extend the current
Dec. 30, 1991, deadline for installation of the so-called traffic
alert and collision avoidance system, or TCAS-II, to Dec. 30, 1993.
   The FAA would be empowered to allow even a longer delay if
problems continued. The bill also requires a one-year study of the
equipment beginning by Dec. 30, 1990.
   The Senate has yet to approve the legislation.
   A law enacted in 1987 set the current dates for installation of
the devices in airliners with at least 30 seats. The requirement
would cover 4,000 U.S. aircraft, and would cost an estimated
$310,000 for each unit, including installation.
   Industry groups have complained that the devices, which are not
mass-produced, will take a long time to manufacture, install, test
and maintain properly. A slower installation schedule was also
recommended by the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional
research agency, and supported by the FAA.
   ``There are problems in both the manufacture and the
installation,'' said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the
House aviation subcommittee. ``It cannot move ahead as fast as we
would like.''
   The delay could also save the airline industry money in
installation costs. The carriers want the government to allow them
to delay the installation of wind-shear detection equipment as
well, so that both systems could be placed into aircraft
simultaneously.
   TCAS-II can warn pilots of nearby aircraft and suggest a
vertical change of course to avoid a collision. A less
sophisticated version of the device, TCAS-I, is used by smaller,
private aircraft.

<HEAD>Troubled Wang Reports $375 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. is so troubled that
it would be put up for sale were it not for the objection of the
founding family, which controls the stock voting rights and is
struggling to turn the computer maker around, analysts say.
   The Lowell-based company reported a $375 million quarterly loss
Monday and announced it had suspended dividend payments. It also
said its financial condition put it in violation of a bank lending
agreement.
   In addition to the objection of the Wang family to a sale, the
company is burdened with lines of business that are not attractive
to potential buyers, analysts said. The family controls 80 percent
of the stock voting rights.
   Most of the quarterly loss stemmed from a $237 million pre-tax
charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing
factories, cutting jobs and lowering the book value of outdated
assets.
   But the company also lost money on its ongoing operations.
   ``A third of (the loss) is current operations and clearly they
have to reduce their expense structure further,'' said John W.
Adams, chairman of Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. ``I'm sure
they're aware of it. The computer business has just gotten to be
more and more competitive.''
   The latest bad news pushed Wang's stock down 37{ cents to close
at $6.12{ a share on the American Stock Exchange.
   Wang stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since
early 1984, when it traded above $35 a share.
   The most pressing crisis for Wang is that the loss in its fourth
fiscal quarter reduced its net worth below the level required by
its commercial banks under a $300 million revolving credit
agreement.
   Wang said it had received waivers from the banks through Aug. 10
and was continuing to negotiate new terms that would give it some
breathing room. The company said it hired Lodestar Group and
Salomon Brothers Inc. as financial advisers.
   Founded in 1951, Wang ranks 145th on Fortune magazine's list of
the 500 largest American industrial companies, but in recent years
the computer maker has shown a pronounced limp.
   After building a reputation in office word processors in the
1970s, Wang watched as sales slowly eroded due to powerful personal
computers that have taken their place. Its minicomputer business
likewise faltered as the popularity of workstations has risen.
   Wang is trying to make a comeback by focusing on four types of
customers: financial services, government, manufacturing and
professional services. Its most promising asset is Freestyle, a
technology that allows interaction with a personal computer through
an electronic pencil instead of a keyboard or ``mouse.''
   Wang also is promoting its imaging equipment, which allows
companies to electronically scan documents, photographs and other
material and enter it into a computer for storage and collation.
The materials may later be recalled on a computer screen in their
original form.
   Wang cut its work force by more than 10 percent to 28,300 in the
year ended June 30, while executives have taken pay cuts of 5
percent to 20 percent.
   More jobs will be shed in the coming months with the previously
announced decisions to close a 240-employee factory in Stirling,
Scotland, and reduce employment at its Juncos, Puerto Rico, plant
to 125 people from 500.
   On top of Wang's financial problems are the health problems of
An Wang, the company's 69-year-old founder and chairman, who
underwent surgery July 14 for cancer of the esophagus. He left the
hospital Thursday and doctors said he is progressing, according to
Wang spokesman Joseph Roy.
   ``He has a Freestyle at home and he's been in contact with us
quite frequently,'' Roy said.
   Wang's son, Frederick, is president of the company.
   For the quarter ended June 30, the net loss of $374.7 million
came on revenue of $783.7 million, compared with earnings of $13.4
million, or 8 cents a share, on $822.8 million in revenue for the
same period a year ago.
   The company reported a net loss of $424.3 million for all of it
its 1989 fiscal year as compared with net income of $92.7 million,
or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $3.07 billion in its fiscal 1988.
   The company said directors voted not to declare a quarterly
dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 1990, but will consider an
annual dividend policy as soon as operating performance allows.

<HEAD>Record $4 Million Fine For Alleged Cocoa Futures Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New York-based commodity futures trading
concern, Philipps Brothers Inc., and three affiliates have agreed
to pay a record $4 million in penalties to settle federal
allegations of fraud in cocoa futures contracts.
   Philipp Brothers is a wholly owned subsidiary of Salomon Inc.,
which controls the venerable Wall Street investment firm Salomon
Brothers. But federal officials stressed that present management at
Salomon was not involved in any alleged wrongdoing.
   Company and federal officials also said the allegations released
Monday had nothing to do with an ongoing investigation into trading
practices at commodities exchanges in Chicago.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates U.S.
futures markets, has been criticized in recent months for allegedly
lax enforcement of regulations at the nation's futures exchanges.
Critics point to the two-year undercover Justice Department
investigation of alleged trading fraud in the Chicago exchanges,
which reportedly could lead to scores of indictments against
traders and others.
   In announcing the settlement Monday, Dennis Klejna, director of
the CFTC's Enforcement Division, said it represented ``by far the
largest civil penalty ever imposed by this commission.''
   The CFTC charged in a 19-count administrative complaint that
Philipp Brothers and others engaged in several deceptive practices
from July 1981 to September 1984.
   But the essence of the case, said Klejna, was the practice known
as ``bucketing.''
   In bucketing, a broker misrepresents trades by buying or selling
futures contracts away from the floor of a futures exchange while
indicating to the customer that the trades were made on the
exchange. All futures transactions are required by law to go
through an exchange.
   The alleged practice resulted in $1.65 million in fees for the
firm that it should not have earned, the CFTC said.
   Philipp Brothers, in a statement issued in New York, said the
firm's current management brought the alleged violations to the
attention of the CFTC after an internal investigation.
   ``The trading practices that led to the settlement were
terminated in the summer of 1984 and the employees involved were
discharged at that time. No present employees of the company were
involved,'' said a company spokesman, Robert F. Baker, who said the
alleged activities occurred before Philipp Brothers became a
subsidiary of Salomon.
   The CFTC charged that Philipp Brothers told customers their
trades were being handled on the Coffee, Cocoa and Sugar Exchange
in New York when the trades actually were handled off of the
exchange floor.
   ``Customers never really held a futures position on the
exchange,'' said Klejna. ``They thought they did, when in fact they
had orders that were booked at the firm.''
   While the traders in question weren't providing the service they
claimed to be providing, ``the customer nevertheless was required
to pay the same commissions, fees and margin (collateral deposited
to buy futures) charged for properly executed transactions and
positions,'' according to the complaint.
   About 100,000 cocoa futures were bought or sold in this manner,
carrying commission fees of about $16 each or a total of $1.65
million, said Klejna.
   The commission also alleged that Philipp Brothers and others
entered into improper pre-arranged trades and fictitious sales, and
failed to accurately prepare order tickets.
   In addition to Philipp Brothers, three affiliates _ Phibro Corp.
and Philipp Brothers Commodities Corp., both of New York, and Cocoa
Merchants Ltd. of London _ settled the allegations without
admitting or denying guilt, said Klejna.
   Five former employees of Philipp Brothers were charged in the
complaint and have not yet settled with the CFTC: Anthony H.D.
Weldon, of London; Daniel F. Tulig, of Sparta, N.J.; Peter Gilliam,
of Surrey, England; Esther Lander Greenfield, of Monsey, N.Y.; and
Mark Glowatz, of East Meadow, N.Y.
   The alleged violations occurred during primarily on behalf of
commercial customers, said Klejna.

<HEAD>USDA Says Export Program Meeting Goals Of Increased Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farm export subsidy program is meeting its
goals of increasing sales of agricultural products abroad and
pressuring U.S. competitors to negotiate in international trade
talks, government officials told Congress.
   The Agriculture Department and the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, delivered the favorable
assessments of the Export Enhancement Program to a House
Agriculture subcommittee Monday. The USDA, which just completed a
study of EEP, said fears the Bush administration might halt the
program were unfounded.
   ``We believe that EEP is an important trade policy tool,'' said
Richard T. Crowder, USDA undersecretary for international affairs
and commodity programs.
   GAO credited the subsidy program for increasing farm exports to
a number of countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Egypt,
Jordan and Iraq, and said abandoning EEP would ``weaken the U.S.
negotiating position'' with the European Community.
   Under EEP, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities at lower
prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   There have been $8.4 billion in farm sales through the program
since it was established by the 1985 farm law, and the subsidies
were valued at nearly $2.6 billion. About half of the $770 million
allocated for the program this year has been awarded, with most of
the subsidies going for wheat sales.
   In its study, USDA estimated that EEP subsidies caused wheat
exports to grow 10 percent to 30 percent more than what they would
have been without the program. The department concluded the program
operated at little or no cost to the government by moving more
grain into export markets, which in turn helps lower the cost of
federal price supports to farmers.
   White House budget officials directed USDA to review the program
last year to answer questions about its cost and whether it was
meeting its goals. Farm-state lawmakers expressed concern earlier
this year that EEP subsidy offers appeared to have been put on hold
during the review, although administration officials have said
there were no delays.
   At the hearing, members of the wheat, soybeans and feed grains
subcommittee criticized USDA's management of the subsidy program
and questioned why the agency had not used the program for soybean
oil sales to the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., the subcommittee chairman, complained
that USDA had not finished a review of a Swiss-based company's
possible ties to a fugitive commodities trader. The company, Richco
Grain Ltd., received at least $65 million in subsidies through EEP.
   ``You have yet to tell us how the largest tax evader in the
history of the United States of America, one of them, was able to
participate in the Export Enhancement Program,'' said Glickman.
   Glickman contends the company is tied through a series of
subsidiary arrangements to Marc Rich, who fled to Switerland in
1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering,
mail and wire fraud.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has failed to
impose sufficient management controls over a new computer system
aimed at allowing spot-checks of certain meat and poultry
processing plants, the General Accounting Office said.
   In a report prepared for a House Government Operations
subcommittee, the congressional investigative arm found fault with
many aspects of the department's ``Performance Based Inspection
System.'' In general, it concluded the department's computer system
aimed at singling out plants for inspection on the basis of their
health risk had not lived up to its billing.
   The report, released Monday, concluded the Agriculture
Department's computerized inspection-scheduling system ``cannot be
relied upon to give the type of quality information needed as a
basis for making decisions'' on which plants should be scrutinized.
   ``The GAO report confirms the evidence from our April hearing
that PBIS does not adequately protect consumers from unsafe
processed meat and poultry,'' Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of
the human resources subcommittee, said in a statement.
   ``I am alarmed that since April, USDA has installed this flawed
system nationally and intends to spend more than $13 million on
PBIS by 1996,'' he said. ``Hopefully, USDA will heed GAO's advice
to stop wasting any more money on PBIS until the agency has
regained control over the program.''
   Mitchell Zeller, counsel to the subcommittee, said in an
interview that Congress enacted legislation in 1986 allowing the
Agriculture Department to go to a system of spot-checking certain
suspect meat and poultry inspection plants. In doing so, the agency
abandoned routine inspections of individual plants and began
reducing the number of inspectors from 2,300 to 1,100. The agency
said that would save the government $27 million a year.
   ``The theory was fine,'' Zeller said. ``But they've taken
control of inspections away from the inspectors and put too much
reliance on a computer system that doesn't work.''
   In his report to the House panel, James W. Harman, director of
food and agriculture issues at the GAO, said investigators ``found
various problems'' with the computerized inspection-scheduling
system and said they stemmed in large part from the agency's
``failure to apply management controls.''
   Agricultre Department officials had no immediate comment on the
GAO report. But in his report, Harman said he had discussed the
problem with agency officials.
   ``While generally agreeing with our assessment of PBIS,'' the
agency said the computerized system was its ``highest priority''
and said they would ``make a concerted effort to correct any
problems,'' he said.

automotive service centers under the familiar red, white and blue
STP logo over the next three to five years. The company also
expects to see revenues from the new venture grow to $150 million a
year during that period.
   ``STP has connotative qualities of high performance, high
technology, durability and dependability ... all of which were
considered highly favorable in launching this brand into another
business,'' said Ronald A. Artzer, president of STP Consumer
Services Inc., a subsidiary of First Brands.
   The STP centers will offer oil changes, car washes, cooling
system maintenance and tune-ups. They will compete directly against
other established automotive service companies, such as Jiffy Lube
International Inc., Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and Sears, Roebuck
and Co.
   ``The competition is getting a lot stiffer,'' said analyst
Franklin L. Morton, a vice president with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
in Baltimore.
   ``The market is growing and so is the number of people entering
the market,'' Morton said, noting other newcomers include the Ford
Motor Co. and Avis Inc.
   Morton said a shakeout is inevitable due to the vast growth of
car service companies. He said a key to success will be careful
marketing.
   In another sign of the industry's growing competition, Pennzoil
Co. agreed last week to buy 80 percent of Jiffy Lube and take over
management of the chain, which has more than 1,000 franchised
outlets. The oil company is expected to strengthen the chain's
market position.
   The first STP center opened last month in Atlanta. Three more
are planned for Atlanta, and another is planned for Charolotte,
N.C., as First Brands tests its new concept. The cities were chosen
because they are in auto-racing country, where STP is well known
for its long affiliation with NASCAR racing and driver Richard
Petty.
   The business marks the second new subsidiary for First Brands,
which has been looking for ways to expand since it was created in
1986 through a leveraged buyout of Union Carbide Corp.'s home and
automotive divisions.
   The buyout, engineered by executivies of the former Carbide
divisions, created a $1.2 billion corporation with such well-known
products as Prestone antifreeze, Simoniz car wax and Glad plastic
bags, in addtion to STP. But the deal also left First Brand
executives with the challenge of finding new markets for their
well-established products.
   ``The company wanted some growth horizons. I won't say the
businesses we're in are mature, but they've been around awhile,''
Artzer said.
   A marketing study was done, and the results showed potential
growth for STP in automotive repair and maintenance. Artzer said
the study showed a particularly strong growth area in the quick
lube business, where consumers can get an oil change in a matter of
minutes.
   He noted that car manufacturers are suggesting more frequent oil
changes for small-engine cars. The study also showed that there are
not enough service centers to keep up with the demand for routine
maintenance. And people are keeping their cars longer due to the
costs of replacing them, he said.
   ``The dynamics are great,'' said Artzer, who was hired in
September because of his expertise in franchise marketing.
   STP will test two types of service centers. The Atlanta shops
will be ``STP Service Plus'' centers that will offer quick lubes,
car washes, cooling system maintenace and tune-ups. In Charlotte,
it will test ``STP Super Plus,'' which will offer all the same
services plus sell gasoline.
   To reduce the hassle of getting a car repaired, STP will keep
computer records of all work done for its customers. Customers will
be able to obtain maintenace records when they want to sell their
cars and also will receive notices reminding them when regular
maintenance is needed.
   Aside from serving the customer, the computer records will help
STP determine ``operational standards,'' Artzer said. In the 1990s,
this information will be used to sell STP franchises.
   First Brands has set no limit on the money that can be spent to
develop the business into a national chain, Artzer said.
   ``This is a business we want to have a major impact on First
Brands,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   National Westminster PLC, Britain's biggest bank,
on Tuesday reported a 58 percent drop in earnings for the first
half of 1989 due to a sharp increase in its loan-loss provision.
   The bank said after-tax profit for the six months ended June 30
totaled $314 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $740
million, or 50 cents a share, in 1988.
   The latest period included an $8 million charge for the closure
of the bank's primary dealership in New York.
   Natwest also made provisions of $656 million to cover possible
losses on loans to Third World countries, compared with $10 million
in its loan-loss provision a year ago.
   Excluding that pre-tax profit would have risen 13 percent to a
record $1.56 billion, the bank said.

   In an announcement Monday, Montedison said it wanted to acquire

<TEXT>
   Investor Warren Buffett's intention to expand his
stake in Coca-Cola Co. has pushed the soft drink company's stock
sharply higher.
   Buffett, who has made a reputation and rishes as a savvy,
long-term investor, filed a statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission Monday seeking clearance to purchase up to 15
percent of Coca-Cola's common stock.
   Earlier this year, Coca-Cola disclosed that Buffett had acquired
a 6.8 percent stake. He was elected to the company's board of
directors in July.
   Coca-Cola stock spurted $4.50 to $68 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange even though a spokesman for Buffett said that
the filing was not a purchase announcement.
   An analyst said Buffett's plans could inspire other investors to
back Coke.
   ``This may make other investors more interested in Coca-Cola
because Warren Buffett has an extraordinary track record,'' said
analyst Emanuel Goldman, of Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco.
``His even talking about 15 percent in Coca-Cola is a tremendous
endorsement of the company.''
   Randy Donaldson, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said the company was
``delighted when Mr. Buffett made his significant investment in the
Coca-Cola Co. and the relationship that has developed since that
investment has reinforced that initial positive view.''
   Buffett _ who has said he is a Cherry Coke drinker _ is chief
executive officer of the diversified Omaha, Neb.-based conglomerate
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. He and his wife control 45 percent of
Berkshire Hathaway stock.
   Berkshire Hathaway chief financial officer J. Verne McKenzie
said that Monday's filing was not an announcement of immediate
stock purchases.
   ``This does not say there are plans now to buy,'' McKenzie said,
noting that purchase plans would be made based on stock price and
market conditions. ``This gives us a flexibility to buy to match
our flexibility to sell.''
   McKenzie said the filing also addresses Buffett's clearance to
sell his Coca-Cola stock, but ``there are no plans to sell now.''
   When Coca-Cola disclosed in March that Buffett had acquired more
than 6 percent of the company, Buffett called the purchases
``simply a passive investment'' and said he is happy with the way
the company is being managed.
   McKenzie said there had been no change in Buffett's view of the
investment. Buffett was not available for comment Monday.

<HEAD>Kodak Blames Restructuring for Second Quarter, Half-Year Earnings
Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Tuesday its profit
fell 85 percent in the second quarter, mainly because of one-time
charges to cover the cost of a corporate restructuring.
   Even without the special charges, though, net earnings would
have dropped 26 percent from last year's record. The company
attributed the weakness to higher costs, including interest
expenses, and the impact of the dollar's rise.
   ``While volume gains so far this year have been gratifying,
especially in the United States, our earnings have not kept pace,''
Chairman Colby Chandler said in a press release. ``Strong steps are
being taken to address the earnings shortfall.''
   Net earnings from the second quarter were $60 million, or 18
cents a share, down from a record $390 million, or $1.20 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to a record $4.5 billion from $4.13
billion a year earlier.
   For the first half, earnings fell 60 percent to $260 million, or
80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to a record $8.4 billion from $7.46 billion a year
earlier.
   Earnings from operations were $276 million for the quarter,
compared with a restated $769 million for the second quarter of
1988. For the half-year, operating earnings dipped to $745 million
from last year's restated $1.24 billion.
   The company announced July 24 that it was taking a $225 million
charge against earnings for the second quarter of 1989 because of
consolidation of its photofinishing and consumer photography units
and associated write-offs of equipment, salaries and goodwill,
along with special separation payments to outgoing employees.
   ``For the balance of the year, we look for continued gains in
sales with earnings improved over the half year to approximately
the same level as the record earnings reported for the 1988 second
half,'' Chandler said.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Debt Negotiators To Meet With Mexicans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela's debt negotiating team is
scheduled to consult with Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe on
Friday before beginning informal talks with commercial bankers.
   Venezuela's chief debt negotiator, Miguel Rodriguez, told
reporters Monday that his country would seek at least a 50 percent
reduction of its debt, beyond Mexico's gains in negotiations with
its bank creditors.
   Mexico reached an agreement with banks two weeks ago to reduce
its debt one of three ways _ through a 35 percent reduction of
capital, a ceiling on interest rates of 6.25 percent, or fresh
loans to cover old debts.
   Mexico's debt totals $104 billion, of which $54 billion is owed
to banks.
   Venezuela owes $33 billion, out of which $20.3 billion is owed
to banks.
   Venezuela's first formal offer of a 50 percent reduction of
interest and capital was rejected by the negotiating commission of
its commercial creditors a few days before the Mexican accord was
announced.
   Following one day of work sessions with their Mexican
counterparts, the Venezuelan debt negotiating team will fly on to
New York, Washington and Toronto to meet informally with bank
representatives, said Rodriguez.
   We will inform ourselves well of the Mexican negotiations with
the banks, he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said Tuesday its
fourth-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago.
   Bear Stearns, parent of the investment firm, Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co., reported net income of $47.6 million, or 50 cents a share, up
from $20.8 million, or 19 cents a share, in the comparable 1988
period.
   Revenue totaled $629.7 million, a 30 percent increase over
$485.8 million a year ago.
   For the fiscal year ended June 30, the New York holding company
posted a 71 percent rise in net earnings to $172.4 million, or
$1.78 a share, from $100.7 million, or 96 cents a share, in the
previous year. Revenue jumped 25 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.9
billion in the last fiscal year.
   Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive, said the
company's earnings per share neared the previous record set in the
year ended April 30, 1987, six months before the stock market
collapse.
   ``We believe this is a strong endorsement of the many decisions
we made in October 1987 and we look forward to the new year with
continued optimism,'' Greenberg said.
   Although the company's earnings plunged dramatically after the
stock market crash of October 1987, it vowed not to cut back
businesses or lay off employees. The company said at the time it
would continue to tighten expenses and hire new employees.

   Stock prices were mixed today after the release
of economic reports that reawakened fears of a possible recession
among some investors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 2.28
points at 2,658.38 as of 11 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues and declining ones were almost evenly matched
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 640 higher, 641 lower and 509
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 78.30 million shares.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said today its
index of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowest
reading since an identical one in January 1983.
   Also pointing toward slow growth was a Commerce Department
report on a decline in construction spending.
   Before the reports' release the Dow Jones industrial average had
been up 13 points. Stock investors are jittery at these levels.
Monday's rally carried the Dow Jones average to within 60 points of
its record high, 2,722.42 on Aug. 25, 1987.
   ``The purchasing managers indeed took the starch out of it. ...
You have people looking at one word in the back of their mind, and
that is recession,'' said Thomas R. Walsh, senior vice president
and head of equity trading at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc.
   On the other hand, Walter Murphy, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst,
said he felt the economic reports were not a factor in the market's
retrenchment.
   ``The market is down because of its own internal technicals
rather than any fundamental external news,'' he said.
   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declining
interest rates. Bond prices rallied on Monday and the price gains
continued early in today's trading.
   But the economic slowdown that helps the inflation-sensitive
bond market is not so good for the stock market because slow growth
could hurt corporate profits.
   Today the Commerce Department added to evidence that the economy
was sluggish by announcing that construction spending in June fell
0.8 percent, following a rise of 0.6 percent in May. The May
increase had originally been estimated at 1.3 percent.
   Among the early volume leaders on the NYSE, Texaco was up \ at

0.11 to 192.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.01 to 3767.55.
   On Monday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 25.42

   Massachusetts got $50,000 for a
Mercedes-Benz it seized and auctioned in its corporate tax fight
with the West German luxury auto maker, but that will do little to
resolve the $7 million in taxes it claims the company owes.
   The red, four-door Mercedes SEL 560 was valued at $74,000 but
fetched only the minimum bid of $50,000 at an auction Monday. The
car's owner was Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. until the state
took possession of the car on July 6 from the home of a company
employee.
   ``The people who bought it got a very good deal on it,'' said
Betsy Houghteling, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Revenue.
   Massachusetts officials allege that Mercedes owes the state $7.1
million in delinquent corporate taxes. The company disputes that
claim but has failed to appear in Massachusetts courts on the issue.
   The state is preparing to take the case to courts in New Jersey,
where Mercedes North American corporate headquarters are located.
   Houghteling said the state's usual strategy in corporate tax
cases is to seize the assets of a company. But beyond an occasional
employee car, Mercedes has few assets in Massachusetts; dealerships
are independent operations.
   Mercedes spokesman A.B. Shuman said Tuesday that Mercedes has no
formal operations in Massachusetts.
   ``In those states where we do have operations, we pay our full
taxes. The business in Massachusetts is interstate commerce and
that is exempted from this kind of taxation,'' Shuman said.
   The Massachusetts Revenue Department argues, however, that
although Mercedes has no corporate headquarters or major facilities
in Massachusetts, it has employees there and makes money by selling
cars to Massachusetts dealers.
   The tax case against Mercedes began in 1985 as an investigation
of delinquent taxes against several foreign car manufacturers. The
others in the case have paid their debts and are abiding by the
state's position on taxation. Because those cases are settled, the
revenue department does not release the names of the companies.
   ``We've collected $10 million from those other companies and
Mercedes is the only holdout,'' Houghteling said. ``It would be
fair to say that Mercedes' position is unique in the industry.''
   Massachusetts is closely watching cases in other states in which
revenue departments try to collect taxes merely on the basis of a
company's advertising in that state.
   ``You don't need to have your company headquarters in a state to
be found to be doing business there,'' Houghteling said.
   Shuman declined to comment on the seizure of the four-door
Mercedes in Massachusetts but criticized the revenue department for
its pejorative language in discussing the tax case.
   ``We're made to look like scofflaws,'' he said.
   Houghteling said most of the $50,000 will go into the state
general fund. But the amount may be largely symbolic because the
state may have to pay thousands to fight its legal battle against
Mercedes for the rest of the back taxes.

   Soybean futures prices rose slightly in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn and wheat
futures were narrowly mixed following a broad selloff in the
previous session.
   The soybean market advanced in line with modest gains in soybean
oil and soybean meal.
   On Monday, soybean prices for near-term delivery plunged below
$7.25 a bushel, a 16{-month low, following a wetter-than-expected
weekend in key Midwestern growing areas.
   A six- to 10-day National Weather Service forecast issued late
Monday predicted a return to mild, rainy conditions in the Midwest
next week, which was seen as bearish for the corn and soybean
markets.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress report showed
continued improvement in crop conditions during the week ending
Sunday.
   The USDA rated 79 percent of the U.S. corn crop in fair to good
condition and 15 percent in excellent condition, up from 12 percent
in the previous week. The USDA said 84 percent of the soybean crop
was in fair to good shape and 9 percent was in excellent condition
compared with 7 percent in the previous week's survey.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.85{ a bushel; corn was
1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.21{ a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 4{ cents higher with September at $1.34 a
bushel; soybeans were } cent to 2{ cents higher with August at
$6.27 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August
at 72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .05
cent higher with August at 83.55 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
to .47 cent lower with August at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .42 cent to .97 cent lower with August at 24.65 cents
a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Monday while pork futures were
mostly lower.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday offered $1,000
factory-sponsored cash incentives on 21 Ford, Lincoln and Mercury
models and $300 to $750 on 13 others.
   As the Big Three carmakers near model changeover, they are
throwing cash at customers to help clear showrooms of light-selling
models as well as popular but more expensive cars, like the Probe
LX-GT, which carries a $500 cash-back offer or a discounted annual
percentage rate.
   Ford's discounted interest rates range from 2.9 percent on a
two-year loan to 10.9 percent for five years. The incentives run
indefinitely, Ford said.
   No. 1 General Motors Corp. announced new incentive programs for
four divisions in early July, including the tripling of cash
incentives on two Buick models. Most of the GM division incentives
run indefinitely.
   Chrysler Corp. has ongoing $1,000 cash rebate offers on all
Jeep-Eagle models.
   Ford Division Vice President and General Manager Thomas J.
Wagner said the higher cash rebates are more popular with customers
than discounted interest rates.
   The Lincoln-Mercury Division is offering at least $1,000 cash
back on all its models, including the ongoing $4,000 rebate on the
sporty XR4Ti, which is being phased out.
   Bulging inventories have barely been dented by the incentive
programs to date, and the companies have taken advantage of the
traditional shutdown for retooling to extend the involuntary
vacation for plant workers.
   The eight major domestic automakers sold 19 percent fewer cars
during the first six months of this year compared with the same
period in 1988, which was the second-best sales year in history.
More than 15.8 million cars and light trucks were sold.

<HEAD>Creditors Win Victory in Hunt Bankruptcy Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson said
creditors in the bankruptcy case of William Herbert and Nancy Hunt
can submit suggestions on how the Hunts should repay their debts.
   The judge's decision Monday shifts leverage in the case from the
debtors to the creditors. Creditors previously had to base
negotiations on a plan developed by Herbert Hunt.
   Abramson said he will allow the suggestions because he did not
see a resolution coming from Herbert Hunt's proposed settlement.
   ``I find that the mere filing of competing plans will not impede
debtors' negotiations,'' said the judge, who ultimately will decide
how creditors are paid.
   The Internal Revenue Service and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
of New York, two of the largest creditors in the Herbert Hunt
bankruptcy, said they will file a repayment plan by Friday.
   ``This is exactly what we have been asking for,'' said Grover
Hartt III, an attorney for the IRS.
   The IRS claims Herbert Hunt owes about $300 million in back
taxes while brother Nelson Bunker Hunt owes $700 million. The IRS
has agreed to settle both cases for about $350 million.
   Bunker and Herbert owned one-third of the world's supply of
silver bullion from a silver-shopping spree that began in 1973,
government attorneys claim.
   As the price tumbled to $10 an ounce from $50 an ounce, the
brothers found themselves with debts totaling as much as $2 billion
and creditors threatening the family's beloved Placid Oil Co.
   Barbara Houser, attorney for the Peruvian silver mining company
Minpeco S.A., which seeks $251 million, said she also has a plan
prepared.
   Abramson gave Bunker Hunt and his wife Caroline, until Aug. 31
to work out a repayment plan with their creditors.
   The judge said the Hunt cases are ``two of the most difficult
Chapter 11 cases a lawyer could envision.''
   Stephen A. McCartin, attorney for Herbert and Nancy Hunt said
that allowing creditors to submit repayment proposals will ``make
it more difficult to reach a consensual plan.''
   The IRS plan to be filed this week in the Herbert Hunt case will
recommend that the agency receive 70 percent of a liquidating
trust, or about $60 million. Under the plan, the IRS also would get
$90 million in a non-dischargeable claim that would be paid after
Herbert emerges from bankruptcy.
   The IRS is negotiating a similar settlement proposal with Bunker
and his wife, Caroline.
   The Hunt brothers, including Lamar Hunt, are in U.S. Tax Court
contesting the millions of dollars in taxes the IRS says it is owed
from the 1982 dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their
debts after the silver price collapse.
   The Hunts' non-jury, tax trial reconvenes in Washington, D.C.,
on Aug. 21.

   The Senate Commerce Committee today voted 15-2
to approve President Bush's three nominees for the Federal
Communications Commission and sent the appointments to the floor
for expected speedy confirmation.
   Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he
expected the full Senate to vote on the nominations of Alfred C.
Sikes, Sherrie P. Marshall and Andrew C. Barrett before the
scheduled beginning of the congressional recess on Friday.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,
cast the dissenting votes.
   The vote came one day after a hearing that was dominated by the
issues of sex and violence on the airwaves.
   Gore said he voted against the nomination as a symbolic protest
of eight years of free-market deregulation of the communications
industry under the Reagan administration. He said he believed the
new nominees would continue the Reagan-era philosophy.
   Hollings, Gore and others hit hard on TV indecency, noting that
until Congress stepped in to ban all indecent TV programs in 1988,
the FCC had established a ``safe harbor'' for such shows from
midnight to 6 a.m. when children were presumed not to be watching.
   ``Garbage is garbage regardless of the time of day,'' Hollings
said.
   Barrett sparked a confrontation with Gore when he said that he
abhorred indecent programming, but that the FCC must recognize
``there is a market for indecency'' and that the agency's role is
to decide ``what the law will allow us to tolerate.''
   Americans, Gore responded, are ``sick and tired of what's going
on.''
   Sikes said he would vigorously attack obscene material on the
airwaves, but that the Supreme Court has proscribed much of
Congress' power in the area of free speech and indecency.
   The FCC last year tried to implement the 24-hour ban on indecent
programming, but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged it
on constitutional grounds. A federal appeals court in January
stayed imposition of the law.
   Hollings and other committee members expressed hope that
relations between the FCC and Congress would improve after eight
years of battles with a commission headed by outgoing Chairman
Dennis R. Patrick and his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler.
   Because of his displeasure with Patrick's policies, Hollings had
refused for more than a year to hold hearings on other nominees to
fill two vacancies on the five-member FCC. Patrick will step down
when Sikes is confirmed.
   Sikes, a self-described moderate, is the assistant secretary of
Commerce for communications and information, a former broadcaster
and a longtime political ally of Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., a
member of the committee.
   Barrett is a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission, and
Marshall is a lawyer and former legislative aide to Patrick.
   The nominees face a host of important issues, such as the
government role in fostering international competitiveness in areas
such as high-definition television; further deregulation of the
telephone industry; re-regulating cable television; and assignment
of the airwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephones
and direct broadcast satellites.

   Stock prices were higher today after a brief
downturn, and the market appeared unsettled after its recent sharp
runup.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 8.91 points
at 2,669.57 as of noon EDT.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones about 5 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 741 higher, 602 lower and 510
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.42 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street, up from 73.15 million shares at the same time
Monday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said today its
index of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowest
reading since an identical one in January 1983.
   Also pointing toward slow growth was a Commerce Department
report on a decline in construction spending.
   Before the reports' release the Dow Jones industrial average had
been up 13 points. It fell and was briefly down about 8 points,
then recovered.
   Stock investors are nervous that the market may have risen too
quickly and is due for a downturn. Monday's rally carried the Dow
Jones average to within 60 points of its record high, 2,722.42 on
Aug. 25, 1987.
   ``The purchasing managers indeed took the starch out of it. ...
You have people looking at one word in the back of their mind, and
that is recession,'' said Thomas R. Walsh, senior vice president
and head of equity trading at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc.
   On the other hand, Walter Murphy, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst,
said he felt the economic reports were not a factor in the market's
brief retrenchment.
   ``The market is down because of its own internal technicals
rather than any fundamental external news,'' he said.
   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declining
interest rates. Bond prices rallied on Monday and the price gains
continued early in today's trading.
   But the economic slowdown that helps the inflation-sensitive
bond market is not so good for the stock market because slow growth
could hurt corporate profits.
   Today the Commerce Department added to evidence that the economy
was sluggish by announcing that construction spending in June fell
0.8 percent, following a rise of 0.6 percent in May. The May
increase had originally been estimated at 1.3 percent.
   Among the early volume leaders on the NYSE, Texaco was up ] at
53{, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 40|, Upjohn
was down 1[ at 34~, and Citicorp was down { at 33].

   Bridgestone Corp., which last year merged
with Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., said today it was consolidating
its tire business under a new name and corporate headquarters.
   The merged company will be known as Bridgestone-Firestone Inc.,
the company said.
   Although Firestone's corporate headquarters is in Chicago and
Bridgestone's U.S. unit is in Nashville, the new company will be
based in Akron, where Firestone was founded in 1900.
   John J. Nevin, Firestone chairman and chief executive officer,
will serve as chairman of Bridgestone-Firestone until he is
scheduled to retire next year, the company said.
   Tokyo-based Bridgestone completed its $2.6 billion acquisition
of Firestone last April, and Firestone became Bridgestone's wholly
owned subsidiary.

   Share prices ended lower Tuesday, but above
session lows, as the market recouped a portion of its losses in
response to Wall Street's venture into positive territory.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index declined 4.7
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,292.3, well above the session
low of 2,284.5. At its highest, the index touched 2,297.5.
   Trading activity was driven by the activities of investors, with
most institutions steering clear of the market until its near-term
direction becomes clearer. Buying sentiment also took an early
knock from a large sell program, traders said.
   At the close, the Financial Times 30-share index was down 2.3

<HEAD>American Express Paying Twice as Much As Said Earlier in Safra Apology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. confirmed Tuesday it has
agreed to pay $8 million, or twice as much as it originally
announced, to settle accusations that people acting on its behalf
spread false information about banker Edmund J. Safra.
   ``There is a second $4 million,'' the company said in a
statement released after the New York Times reported in Tuesday's
editions about the higher total.
   The second $4 million _ intended to reimburse expenses Safra
incurred _ was not disclosed last week because ``we didn't view it
as part of the apology'' to Safra, said American Express spokesman
Larry Armour.
   In a letter dated July 24, American Express Chairman James D.
Robinson III apologized to Safra for ``an unauthorized and shameful
effort'' by people acting on American Express' behalf to encourage
false media reports that Safra's banks had been involved with money
laundering.
   In the letter, he said American Express would donate $4 million
to charities of Safra's choice.
   The Times reported that American Express actually had agreed to
pay $8 million, including the $4 million in donations mentioned in
an exchange of letters that the two sides released Friday in
disclosing their settlement.
   ``We regarded the $4 million mentioned in Friday's exchange of
letters as a clear and simple apology for conduct we regretted,''
American Express said in its statement Tuesday on the matter.
   Safra, an international banker who lives in Geneva, Switzerland,
made a career out of providing banking services to the very rich. A
former American Express executive, he controls Safra Republic
Holdings SA and holds a large stake in Republic National Bank of
New York.
   American Express said Tuesday that it had ``made no attempt to
hide'' the second $4 million, but added, ``we didn't discuss it
either because we didn't regard it as part of the apology.''
   American Express said ``the Safra people had wanted us to
reimburse them for expenses which they said were in the $4 million
range.''
   ``We felt that was an inappropriate request but rather than drag
out what had already become a long and difficult negotiation and in
an effort to resolve matters, we were willing to make the
additional $4 million contribution to charity as a further gesture
of goodwill,'' the statement read.
   Asked if there were any other undisclosed payments or other
features of the settlement with Safra that American Express had not
disclosed on its own, Armour said there were none ``to the best of
my knowledge.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. corporate purchasing managers said Tuesday
their gauge of industrial health fell to the weakest point since
the economic expansion began more than 6{ years ago, a report that
fanned recession fears.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of
the economy's direction, plunged to 46 percent in July from 48.8
percent in June, the third straight monthly decline.
   That makes the level of last month was the lowest since January
1983, the early days of what has become the country's longest
peacetime expansion. The January 1983 reading also was 46 percent.
   The news from the purchasing agents comes at a time when
economic vital signs are under intense scrutiny in the business
world because of questions about whether the economy has enough
strength to continue growing.
   Most analysts think the economy needs the stimulation of lower
interest rates to avert a general recession. Some sectors of the
economy already seem to be sinking into deep declines, analysts say.
   ``I think the index is pointing very ominously toward serious
problems for the economy right now,'' said David Resler, chief
economist at Nomura Securities International. ``It looks to me like
the odds of recession are going up every day.''
   Allen Sinai, economist at the Boston Co., said the report on
business by the National Association of Purchasing Management
underscored the weakened state of the economy's industrial base.
   ``The industrial side of the economy is weak, flirting with
recession,'' said Sinai. ``Parts of the economy and some regions of
the country do appear to be in or near a recession.''
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the
central bank's chief mission now is to prevent the economy from
sliding into a harmful recession. With that aim in mind, the Fed
has loosened its hold on credit.
   Many commercial banks on Monday reduced their prime lending
rates to 10{ percent from 11 percent. The cut in the benchmark rate
is expected to reduce borrowing expenses for businesses and
consumers and encourage spending.
   Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing group's business
survey committee, said members representing manufacturers in
certain industries such as automobiles and consumer durable goods
are pessimistic about the next several months because they know
lower interest rates don't immediately change behavior.
   There typically is a lag of several months before lower credit
costs start to encourage increases in spending.
   Bretz said a reading in the purchasing agents' index below 50
percent indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is
in decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates growth.
   But he said the index would have to fall below 44 percent in
order to suggest an overall decline in economic activity _ meaning
that the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the value of
all goods and services produced, was contracting rather than
expanding.
   The monthly report contained what private economists called some
fairly upbeat news on inflation and trade.
   The price index declined to 46.9 percent in July from 48.5
percent in June and reached the lowest level since April 1986, when
it was 42.8 percent.
   Exports were the strongest element of the economy as slightly
more members of the association reported that they were exporting
in July.
   Here are some details from the report:
   _Manufacturing production fell in July, snapping a string of 35
straight months of expansion. The index of manufacturing output
fell to 48.3 percent from 52.4 percent in June and was the lowest
since a reading of 48.2 percent in July 1985.
   _New orders declined in July for the second consecutive month.
The new orders index fell to 44.8 percent from 47.2 percent in
June. Last month's reading was the lowest since 41.5 percent in
November 1982, when the last economic recession was bottoming out.
   _Employment dropped for the sixth straight month, reflecting
manufacturer reluctance to hire in the face of a slowing economy.
The employment index fell to 44.4 percent in July from 47.4 percent
in June.
   _Inventories fell for a seventh straight month in July, down to
45.5 percent from 49.7 percent.
   _The pace of vendor deliveries quickened in July, with the index
at 46.9 percent vs. 47.5 percent, indicating fewer commodities were
in short supply.
   The association's monthly report is based on replies to
questions asked of purchasing executives in more than 250
industrial companies. The purchasing managers' index is a composite
of five separate indicators, including new orders, production,
vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

<HEAD>U S West Partnership Wins Bid For Record Cable TV Franchise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hong Kong government on Tuesday
awarded the world's largest single cable television franchise to a
consortium including Englewood-based U S West International and
four other companies, U S West Inc. reported.
   Work on the project _ estimated to cost at least $500 million _
will begin immediately and service to customers is expected to be
available in 1991, U S West said in a statement.
   The consortium, Hong Kong Cable Communications, includes U S
West International, which holds a 25 percent share; Wharf Holdings,
a major Hong Kong property development group which holds a 28
percent interest; Sun Hung Kai Properties, a Hong Kong construction
firm with a 27 percent share; Shaw Brothers, an Asian film and
television production and distribution company, and Coditel, a
leading Belgian cable TV company. Shaw Brothers and Coditel share a
10 percent interest in the consortium.
   In addition to winning the rights to provide cable TV to 1.5
million potential customers, the consortium was also awarded a
license to provide data telecommunications services to business and
residential customers throughout the territory, according to the U
S West news statement. The consortium plans to install a digital
network to handle both TV and telecommunications services.
   Jack MacAllister, chairman of U S West inc., said the Hong Kong
franchise represents a major international opportunity for the
company.
   ``We're highly pleased to have been selected by the Hong Kong
government and we feel confident that the combined strengths of our
partners will insure success in providing both cable telvision and
telecommunications services to the people of Hong Kong,'' he said.
   MacAllister said the franchise, combined with major cable TV and
telecommunications operations in Europe, indicates the company is
becoming ``a major player'' in the international cable
communications industry.
   U S West International is the international business development
subsidiary of U S West Inc. The company's major subsidiary, U S
West Communications, provides communications services to 10 million
customers in 14 states.
   Other U S West subsidiaries provide cellular communications and
paging services, directory publishing and marketing services,
business telecommunications products and services, data services
and commercial real estate and financial services.
   Reynie Ortiz, resident of U S West International, said the
franchise is important because Hong Kong is growing as an
international trade center and a gateway to Asian business. He said
he is looking forward to the opportunity to ``provide U S West
technology and experience'' to the Hong Kong cable project.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Close Mostly Higher; Near-Month Soybeans Fall Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices closed mostly higher in a
technical rebound Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade but
soybeans for August delivery plunged to a new 16{-month low,
reflecting a rise in supplies from South America.
   In addition to the increased movement of newly harvested
soybeans from Argentina and Brazil, soybean speculators saw an
important technical support swept away Monday when August soybeans
crashed below $6.25 a bushel.
   Monday's 24{-cent plunge in the August contract prompted selling
in an attempt among some traders to depress the market further, to
the next support level of $6 a bushel, said William Biedermann,
director of research with Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage based
in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   The moderate gains in most of the other grain and soybean
contracts were perceived as a technical correction in a bear market.
   With farmers believed to still be holding fairly large amounts
of corn and soybeans and the harvest season approaching, market
fundamentals look ``pretty bleak,'' Biedermann said.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 6{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.87\ a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to 4{ cents higher with September at $2.22\ a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with September at $1.33 a
bushel; soybeans were 10{ cents lower to 8 cents higher with August
at $6.14 a bushel, the lowest settlement of a nearby soybean
contract since March 16, 1988.

<HEAD>International Paper to Pay $990,000 in Fines Under Air-Pollution
Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. has agreed to pay
fines totaling $990,000 and has installed $4.5 million worth of
air-pllution equipment at a local mill under a proposed consent
decree with the state and federal governments, officials announced
Tuesday.
   The fine is the largest environmental fine ever levied in Maine,
and the stiffest ever imposed in New England for violations of the
federal Clean Air Act, state and federal officials said.
   ``It used to be that dirty air had to be suffered by all Maine
people so that some corporations might prosper. This settlement is
an indication that those days are over,'' Maine Attorney General
James E. Tierney said at a news conference at which the agreement
was announced.
   State Environmental Protection Commissioner Dean C. Marriott
portrayed the settlement as only the latest result of his
department's stepped-up efforts to crack down on polluters.
   ``There's more to come,'' he told reporters.
   The company, which denied all the allegations, issued a brief
statement noting that the agreement is still subject to approval by
a federal judge and that the alleged violations occurred during the
late 1970s and early 1980s.
   ``None of the situations which are alleged to have been
violations are recent or ever posed a danger to the health and
well-being of our employees or surrounding community members,''
said Richard White, a spokesman for International Paper's Jay mill.
   International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y., is the largest
U.S. paper producer.
   At issue in the case, which dates back to 1983, is a waste fuel
incinerator that is the largest source of particulate emissions at
the mill.
   The company had planned to restrict the amount of oil burned in
the incinerator, thereby exempting it from tough ``new source''
pollution standards established under the Clean Air Act. But the
state and federal governments alleged the company repeatedly used a
greater amount of oil and that emissions from the incinerator
should be subject to those more stringent standards, which cover
such materials as particulates, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
   In addition, the state had charged additional violations of
state law, including the company's failure to properly monitor
ambient air quality around the mill.
   Under the consent decree, IP must pay a $540,000 fine to the
state and $450,000 to the federal government. Further, the company
has modified the incinerator to permanently restrict the amount of
oil it burns and installed $4.5 million worth of pollution control
equipment.
   IP also agreed to cut emissions of particulates by half and to
conduct tests next year to determine whether further reductions are
possible.
   Tierney stressed that the settlement is unrelated to a state
lawsuit filed a year ago that alleges widespread violations at the
mill of many state environmental laws. That suit is still pending,
he said.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Telephone Operations Group plans to break
ground Wednesday for its new headquarters, a plum the nation's
largest non-Bell telephone company had threatened to withdraw from
Texas in the wake of unfavorable regulatory decisions.
   GTE Corp. announced last year it planned to locate the
headquarters for its largest operating unit in the Dallas suburb of
Irving.
   The Stamford, Conn.-based company said in March it was
reconsidering the decision after the Texas Public Utilities
Commission refused to grant GTE Southwest Inc. a rate increase,
instead ordering the utility to cut rates and issue refunds to
Texas customers.
   At the time, state officials accused the company of using the
headquarters move to pressure regulators into changing their minds.
The commission has twice refused to reopen the case.
   Although GTE announced in April it would go ahead with the
headquarters move, GTE Southwest continues to appeal parts of the
PUC decision, even though it has begun cutting phone bills.

<HEAD>Carbide Implements Anti-Takeover Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after a court settlement in
the Bhopal gas disaster fueled speculation about possible takeover
attempts, Union Carbide Corp. said Tuesday it has implemented
``poison pill'' measures to ward off unwanted suitors.
   Carbide spokesman David N. Kernis called the anti-takeover
measures routine and said officials at the Danbury, Conn.-based
company don't know of any possible takeover attempts and ``none has
been offered.''
   ``Nearly 1,000 companies have these things. We're sure from time
to time these things have come up (for review at Carbide). But,
obviously, this is our first one,'' Kernis said.
   The ``poison pill'' measures, announced last week, would allow
Carbide shareholders to acquire additional stock at a deep
discount, thereby making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive
for a potential acquirer.
   Analysts have said the corporation became a prime takeover
candidate in February, when the Supreme Court of India ordered the
multinational chemical giant to pay $470 million to settle claims
arising from the 1984 Bhopal disaster. But they were cautious in
evaluating Carbide's poison-pill plan.
   While immersed in the legal battle over Bhopal in 1985, Carbide
successfully fought off a $4.3 billion hostile takeover attempt by
GAF Corp. by repurchasing some of its common stock. Directors said
later they never considered a poison-pill defense.
   Harvey Stober, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
Monday that Carbide is attractive because it has tremendous cash
flow, businesses that can be separated and sold off, and it has
``easily understood'' businesses. In addition, he said the
company's stock is currently undervalued, closing up \ of a point
Monday at $27.12{.
   Carbide last week reported second quarter earnings of $186
million, or $1.33 a share, on sales of $2.28 billion. The earnings
were down slighty from 1988 second quarter earnings of $187
million, or $1.39 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion.
   Stober said corporate takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn has been
mentioned as one possible Carbide suitor. But Stober said he
believed the company when it said no takeover offers have been made.
   ``It's something that many companies have done. It's usually
done to get fair treatment under a hostile attempt and usually to
preclude the use of greenmail,'' he said. Greenmail is an
antitakeover maneuver in which the target company buys the raider's
stock at a price above that available to other stockholders.
   Leslie Ravitz, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said that
Carbide's action was typical of the chemical industry. He said it
would be misleading to interpret Carbide's plan as an indication
that it will soon become involved in an acquisition, noting that
the company has had no suitors in the many months that it has been
the subject of takeover talks.
   Ravitz agreed that Carbide is an attractive takeover target. But
so is ``virtually every company out there in the chemical
industry,'' he said, adding that the stock of most chemical
companies are currently undervalued.
   Ravitz said Carbide's poison-pill measures are good only as long
as the board of directors wants to keep them in place. He said if a
large enough cash offer is made, the directors would have to revoke
measures.
   ``It doesn't preclude a takeover. It just gives you a hurdle to
jump,'' he said.
   Under the Carbide plan, shareholders of record as of Aug. 31
will receive one right to purchase a share of common stock at a
discount for each outstanding share of stock they own. The rights
will expire on Aug. 31, 1999, unless redeemed by the company at a
cost of 1 cent per right.
   The rights are exercisable only within 10 days after a potential
buyer acquires 20 percent or more of Carbide common stock, or only
within 10 days of an announcement of a tender offer to acquire at
least 20 percent of Carbide stock.

   Stock prices finished lower in active trading
today, buffeted by conflicting sentiments about the economy.
   Wall Street started the day higher, adding to the strong gains
of recent sessions, but later retreated in edgy, volatile activity.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said today its
index of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowest
reading since an identical one in January 1983.
   Also pointing toward slow growth was a Commerce Department
report on a decline in construction spending.
   The department said construction spending in June fell 0.8
percent, following a rise of 0.6 percent in May. The May increase
had originally been estimated at 1.3 percent.
   The reports' release pushed the Dow Jones industrial average
lower, and the blue-chip indicator swung widely up and down through
the rest of the trading session.
   Stock investors are nervous that the market may have risen too
quickly and is due for a downturn. Monday's rally carried the Dow
average to within 60 points of its record high, 2,722.42 on Aug.
25, 1987.
   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declining
interest rates. But the economic slowdown that helps the
inflation-sensitive bond market is not so good for the stock market
because slow growth could hurt corporate profits.
   ``It's that balancing act,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Of course we know the economy
has been softening, but bad news has been good news up to now.''

   Worried about hail in Hawaii? Afraid of getting
fogged in at Heathrow? Fear not, yet another Dial-the-Weather
service has opened.
   American Express announced Monday that it has opened
1-900-WEATHER, a 24-hour number which provides temperatures and
conditions for more than 600 locations around the world.
   The new service joins USA Today's 1-900-370-USAT, which provides
more than 500 far-flung forecasts.
   Jeffrey Bander, vice president for development of new products
at American Express, said the credit card company conducted two
different research projects before launching its weather phone.
   They discovered ``how important weather is to travelers,'' said
Bander. ``This is one more way we could provide service.''
   The idea behind the weather lines is not new; before its
court-ordered break-up, AT&amp;T provided local weather information via
telephone.
   There's one major difference: the new lines cost more.
   Unlike the old 10-cent call for local weather, these lines run
about 80 cents for the first minute and 50 cents for each
subsequent minute.
   ``It's not going to make you a whole bunch of money, but that's
not why we're doing it,'' said Phil Fuhrer, vice president of
Gannett New Media.
   1-900-WEATHER offers callers the current weather and a three-day
forecast, plus skiing and highway conditions in the winter and
coastal reports during the summer.
   USA Today, which prints comprehensive national weather forecasts
each day, launched its service on May 8 and now receives about 500
to 600 calls daily, said Fuhrer.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall as Hurricane Worries Abate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices dropped Tuesday, giving
back part of the previous session's gains as a hurricane in the
Gulf of Mexico swept ashore, enabling offshore oil producers to get
back to work.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 28 cents to $18.03 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising
38 cents in the previous session. Contracts for delivery in later
months posted similar losses.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
September contract of unleaded gasoline also tumbled, falling 1.27
cents to 51.43 cents a gallon after spurting 1.15 cents a gallon on
Monday. Later contract months posted smaller declines.
   The September contract for delivery of No.2 heating oil settled
0.11 cent lower at 49.20 cents a gallon after rising 0.49 cent on
Monday.
   ``It was the mirror image of yesterday in crude oil and
gasoline,'' said Bob Baker, who follows oil futures prices for the
investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   On Monday, prices had risen on fears that the storm would
severly disrupt production off the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
   But Baker said those fears proved largely unfounded on Tuesday
and the market concluded ``the hurricane was not going to be much
of a factor in reducing supplies.''
   Hurricane Chantal roared ashore at about 8 a.m. Tuesday on the
upper Texas Gulf Coast and within two hours, tides at Galveston
were reported near normal, enabling several oil drilling companies
to send employees back to work on oil drilling platforms and rigs
in the Gulf.

   The dollar tumbled in choppy U.S. trading
Tuesday, weighed down by additional evidence of sluggish economic
activity and expectations of further interest rate declines.
   Gold prices traded near recent levels. On the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold for August delivery closed at $370.80 a troy
ounce, up 30 cents from Monday's settlement. The Republic National
Bank quoted bullion at $370.50 an ounce as of 4 p.m. in New York,
10 cents higher than Monday's late bid.
   After some initial strength in early New York dealings, the
dollar started to slide after release of a monthly business report
from the National Association of Purchasing Management showing
weakness in manufacturing.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 46 percent in July
from 48.8 percent in June, falling to the lowest level since
January 1983.
   The news from the nation's purchasing agents, coupled with
report of a drop in construction spending, reinforced expectations
of further reductions in interest rates.
   Decreases in U.S. interest rates would cut returns on
dollar-denominated investments and lessen demand for dollars.
   Thomas Palladino, an assistant vice president at Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank's New York office, said currency dealers have been
operating under the assumption that the Federal Reserve Board has
been nudging interest rates lower.
   A rumor swept through the market Tuesday that the central bank
was about to slash its discount rate, a move that would underscore
the Fed's desire for looser credit conditions to revive the
flagging economy.
   Although there wasn't any substance to the rumor, it intensified
the selling, which drove the dollar down toward thresholds
considered technically significant, Palladino said.
   The rumor may have been triggered by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. He confirmed
that the central bank lowered interest rates another notch last
week as part of its continuing effort to keep the country out of
recession.
   Earlier, on currency markets abroad, the dollar headed higher in
subdued trading.
   Dealers in Europe reportedly were preoccupied with adjusting
their dollar holdings ahead of Friday's release of U.S.
unemployment figures for July, a potentially market-moving report.
   Sterling stumbled after rebounding recently from a slump. The
pound fell to $1.6550 from $1.6665 late Monday. In New York,
sterling fetched $1.6648 vs. $1.6655 on Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.75 yen to close at 136.65 yen.
Later, in London, the dollar traded at 136.80 yen. In New York the
dollar closed at 135.80 yen, down from 137 yen on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8505 West German marks, down from 1.8650; 1.5895
Swiss francs, down from 1.6080; 1.1747 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1811; 6.266 French francs, down from 6.3135; and 1,330.05 Italian
lire, down from 1,341.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels included: 1.8660 West German marks, up from 1.8655; 1.6075
Swiss francs, up from 1.6065; 6.3135 French francs, down from
6.3155; 2.1060 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1030; 1,342.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,340.03; and 1.1743 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1809.
   Gold prices barely budged.
   Gold finished in London at a bid of $368.25 a troy ounce late
Tuesday, unchanged from late Monday.
   The precious metals market in Zurich was closed for a national
holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.62 an ounce to close at
$371.26.
   Silver was trading in London at $5.23 an ounce, up sharply from
Monday's $5.13. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.252 a troy ounce, down from Monday's settlement
of $5.269.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Retreat As Chantal Threat Eases</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices eased Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as the hurricane threat to Gulf Coast oil and natural-gas
operations lessened and traders turned their attention to weekly
supply statistics.
   The market expected the American Petroleum Institute report to
show increases of 1 million to 2 million barrels across the board.
The report, released after the close, showed crude oil stocks up
882,000 barrels, gasoline stocks up 4.6 million barrels and
distillate stocks up about 2.1 million barrels.
   The report also showed a rise in refinery runs, contrary to
expectations.
   On other markets, coffee futures surged; near-month soybean
futures continued to slide but most grain contracts advanced; pork
bellies led the livestock and meat markets lower; and precious
metals were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 29 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in September at $18.03 a
barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .04 cent higher with
September at 49.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .80 cent
to 1.27 cents lower with September at 51.43 cents a gallon.
   The market gave back most of Monday's gains, which were
triggered by fears of damage to Gulf Coast oil refineries and
offshore platforms by Hurricane Chantal.
   ``Today they were selling on the fact that it was not nearly as
bad a hurricane as they were expecting,'' said Ray Mazzeo, energy
futures specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The hurricane lashed the Gulf Coast with heavy rain and wind up
to 80 mph but was downgraded to a tropical storm about 2{ hours
after moving ashore near High Island, Texas, midway between
Galveston and Port Arthur.
   Some offshore oil and gas operations were shut down Monday
afternoon, but they were back in operation late Tuesday.
   Analysts said the only danger to refineries appeared to be the
possibility that the heavy rains could cause some flooding of pumps
located near the ground.
   Coffee futures prices surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange in a reversal of the recent trend.
   Some analysts called the rally a technical correction while
others cited Folger Coffee Co.'s announcement of a
20-cents-per-pound cut in wholesale prices of ground roast coffee.
   Folger said the price cut reflected the sharp drop in green
coffee prices following the International Coffee Organization's
July 3 suspension of export quotas.
   Coffee settled 2.02 cents to 3.38 cents higher with September at
82.37 cents a pound.
   Most grain futures advanced in a technical rebound on the
Chicago Board of Trade but soybeans for August delivery plunged to
a new 16{-month low of $6.13{ a bushel, reflecting a rise in
supplies from South America and growing confidence that U.S.
supplies would last until harvest time.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with September at
$3.87{ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 4{ cents higher with
September at $2.22{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher
with September at $1.33 a bushel; soybeans were 11 cents lower to 8
cents higher with August at $6.13{ a bushel, the lowest settlement
of a nearby soybean contract since March 16, 1988.
   Pork belly futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The near-month contract fell below 25 cents a
pound, reflecting the continuing weak demand for bacon and the
near-record supply of bellies in cold storage.
   Weak cash markets also weighed on the pork and cattle markets.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .50 cent lower with August at
72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .32 cent lower
with August at 83.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to .65
cent lower with August at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent to 1.35 cents lower with August at 24.82 cents a
pound.
   Gold futures were little changed on New York's Commodity
Exchange while silver finished slightly lower after posting strong
gains in the previous session.
   Gold settled 80 cents lower to 30 cents higher with August at
$370.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1.7 cents to 2 cents lower with
September at $5.293 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Armco, USW Settle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Steelworkers on Tuesday announced a
tentative four-year agreement with Armco Inc. that will restore up
to $1 an hour in past reductions to 4,700 union members and further
boost wages up to $1.50 per hour.
   The union's chief negotiator said he expected the offer to be
ratified in a referendum this month by mail. Union negotiators,
voting Monday shortly before the midnight expiration of their old
contract, unanimously recommended membership ratification.
   Armco is the last of five major steelmakers to settle with the
USW during the current round of negotiating. The settlement follows
a pattern set by Bethlehem Steel Corp.
   Armco is offering each worker an immediate $500 signing bonus
and a share of profits.
   Union members at the Baltimore and Kansas City, Mo., plants
would get back wage sacrifices that averaged $1 per hour to be
followed by wage increases averaging 35 cents per hour Aug. 1,
1991, and 40 cents a year later.
   Workers at Armco's Ashland, Ky., plant would no longer
contribute 65 cents per hour to help finance a continuous caster
and would receive $1,000 on Aug. 1, 1990, as an early repayment of
their investments in the $22.5 million caster. More would be repaid
later.
   The Ashland plant employees would also get consecutive annual
raises of 75 cents, 50 cents and 25 cents beginning Jan. 1, 1991.
   The offer also includes cost of living raises effective Aug. 1,
1992, and the restoration of vacations, holidays, premium pay and
shift differentials Jan. 1, 1990.
   Ballots are to be counted Aug. 28 in Pittsburgh.
   Independent unions represent Armco workers in Butler;
Zanesville, Ohio; and Middletown, Ohio. Contracts at Butler and
Zanesville expire at the end of August. Middletown's contract runs
through March 1990, said Armco spokesman Ted Taylor in Parsippany,
N.J.

   Buffeted by conflicting sentiments about the
economy, stock prices finished lower Tuesday in active, choppy
trading.
   Wall Street started the day higher, adding to the strong gains
of recent sessions, but later retreated.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.09 points in the
first half-hour of trading, closed 19.54 points lower at 2,641.12.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
808 issues down, 729 up and 477 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 225.28 million
shares, up sharply from 166.65 million in Monday's session.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowest reading
since an identical one in January 1983. Also pointing toward slow
growth was a Commerce Department report on a decline in
construction spending.
   The reports rallied the bond market but pushed the Dow average
lower, and the blue-chip indicator swung widely up and down through
the rest of the trading session.
   Stock investors are nervous that the market may have risen too
quickly and is due for a downturn. A Monday rally carried the Dow
to within 60 points of its record high, 2,722.42 on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declining
interest rates. But the economic slowdown that helps the
inflation-sensitive bond market is not so good for the stock market
because slow growth could hurt corporate profits.
   ``It's that balancing act,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Of course we know the economy
has been softening, but bad news has been good news up to now.''
   Analysts said the market shrugged off a statement by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the Fed moved to lower
interest rates for a third time last week as part of its effort to
avert a recession.
   Greenspan ``was confirming what the bond market already knew,''
said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Among the volume leaders on the NYSE, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was down } at 39~, Upjohn dropped 1] to 34| and Citicorp
lost { at 33]. Eastman Kodak, which reported lower earnings, fell
1\ to 47.
   Texaco was up | at 53}.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 265.19 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $17.162 billion, or 0.51
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.03 to 191.38.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.48 to 392.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index declined 2.33 to 343.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was
down 0.55 at 453.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index slipped 0.75 to 375.81.

<HEAD>Telephone Company to Block `Adult' Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts users of so-called ``dial-a-porn''
telephone services must request special access to them from the
phone company under a state ruling announced Tuesday.
   ``Our intent is to ensure that customers have the greatest
degree of control possible over the types of information that they
and their children can access,'' said Department of Public
Utilities Chairman Bernice K. McIntyre.
   The department directed New England Telephone to separate state
lines with ``adult'' services on to a 940 exchange. New England
Telephone will automatically block the service to all Massachusetts
customers.
   People who want to call in-state pornographic message services
will have to write the telephone company and request access to the
adult line, the directive states.
   The automatic blocking applies only to adult message services in
Massachusetts. ``We can't regulate interstate calls,'' McIntyre
said.
   But New England Telephone will offer customers the option to
block interstate information services, including out-of-state
pornographic lines, on a 900 exchange. Customers will also have the
option to block multi-party chat lines on 550 and other
pre-recorded information lines on 976.
   New England Telephone will determine which services qualify for
the adult line, McIntyre said.
   The telephone company defines anything that contains sexually
suggestive descriptions or innuendo as adult matter, said Clare
Silvestri, a telephone company spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Bridgestone Consolidates Tire Headquarters In Akron</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Bridgestone Corp., which acquired
Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. for $2.6 billion last year, said
Tuesday the combined business will be headquartered in Akron, where
Firestone was founded 89 years ago.
   Firestone's corporate headquarters is in Chicago and Bridgestone
(USA) Inc. is based in Nashville, Tenn. Firestone, formed in Akron
in 1900, moved its headquarters from Akron to Chicago two years ago.
   Three-hundred Firestone employees now in Chicago will be invited
to relocate to Akron, as will about 200 who work at Bridgestone
(USA) offices in Nashville, said Bridgestone spokesman Dennis Allen.
   Akira Yeiri, Bridgestone president, said in a statement that the
consolidation will enable a unified presentation to tire customers.
   ``The past year since the merger of Bridgestone and Firestone
has been spent reviewing our worldwide organization and
operations,'' Yeiri said. ``We are confident that this
consolidation will allow our operations to respond more efficiently
to the challenges and opportunities in the 1990s and beyond.''
   Although Bridgestone corporate offices will move from Tennessee,
the consolidation does not affect its tire manufacturing plant in
LaVergne, Tenn., which employs about 1,800 workers, and plans for a
$50 million radial truck tire plant in Warren County, Tenn., Allen
said.
   Bridgestone (Canada), in Mississauga, Ont., will also report to
the new headquarters.
   John J. Nevin, Firestone chairman and chief executive officer,
has been named chairman of the board of directors of
Bridgestone-Firestone. Allen said Nevin has plans to retire Jan. 1,
1990, and intends to remain in Chicago.
   The Tokyo-based Bridgestone completed its acquisition of
Firestone in April of last year by paying $80 per share for all
Firestone stock. Firestone became Bridgestone's wholly owned
subsidiary.

   Indictments will be announced Wednesday,
resulting from the FBI's undercover probe of suspected corrupt
practices and traders at the nation's two largest futures
exchanges, law enforcement sources said Tuesday.
   The Justice Department said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
FBI Director William Sessions and Anton Valukas, U.S. attorney for
the northern district of Illinois, would hold an afternoon news
conference in Chicago Wednesday.
   The Justice Department did not give the reason for the news
conference.
   Two law enforcement sources in Washington and Chicago, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press the news
conference was being held to announce indictments stemming from the
two-year investigation.
   One of the sources said Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, also would attend.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that several commodities
traders who have agreed to plead guilty to crimes have been
bargaining for reduced civil penalties.
   A lawyer was not identified told the newspaper said he and other
attorneys have been negotiating with the CFTC to try to minimize
penalties against their clients.
   The commission, which regulates the exchanges, has the power to
pull trading licenses, levy fines and ban future participation in
the markets.
   Eight to 15 traders have agreed to cooperate in the federal
probe of an estimated 50 to 100 traders engaging in allegedly
corrupt practices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
   When charges against cooperating traders are announced, the
commission is expected to disclose administrative penalties, the
newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, the Merc has brought its own charges against four
traders in connection with yen-pit trades with an undercover FBI
agent who was part of the federal probe, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
   The Merc charges represent the third of four possible levels of
repercussions traders could face if found to have defrauded
customers or been guilty of wrongdoing, according to one lawyer who
spoke with The Associated Press.
   The four are federal criminal prosecution, federal
administrative penalties, disciplinary action by the exchanges and
consequences from the National Futures Association, which registers
certain categories of traders and has its own rules and penalties
for violating them, the lawyer said.
   ``Lawyers are calling it quadruple jeopardy,'' he said.
   Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma declined to comment Tuesday on the
Wall Street Journal report, which said the Merc charges concern
prearranged trading in yen-futures contracts expiring in December
and March.
   ``It is our policy not to comment on an investigation ...
(until) disciplinary action is taken,'' Yemma said.
   The charges could result in fines and expulsion of traders, the
Journal said. Administrative action by the CFTC is likely to be
similar, according to the Sun-Times.
   Even traders who cooperate will lose their licenses but may be
spared enormous fines, the Sun-Times said. Also, traders might
avoid long-term bans from participating in the markets by
cooperating.
   For traders who aren't cooperating with federal prosecutors,
however, the trading commission plans to withhold charges until
after trials end, the newspaper said.
   Anyone convicted is expected to face maximum administrative
penalties, while anyone found innocent of criminal wrongdoing may
still be liable for civil action based on court testimony.
   Prosecutors met with about 20 traders' lawyers late last week to
open the way to possible plea-bargain arrangements for clients
facing indictment under the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations act.
   In the two-year futures probe, FBI agents infiltrated the
trading floors to gather evidence of suspected illegal practices.

<HEAD>Northwest Expresses Confidence in Letter to Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has told its 5,000 pilots
that management is optimistic a labor agreement can be reached
despite the breakdown in 29-month-long negotiations.
   S.L. Henning, Northwest's vice president for flight operations,
said in the letter mailed late last week that many key issues
already have been resolved, including a guarantee of no layoffs for
all pilots now employed by the airline and the right to reopen the
contract if the company changes control.
   ``I am well aware of the frustration that you feel over the
unusually long period of time this process has taken,'' Henning
wrote.
   ``I share your frustration. We must, however, keep in mind that
this process has been complicated by the difficulty of combining
two very different pilot contracts (Republic and Northwest), the
ongoing unresolved seniority integration and the takeover activity
during the past several months.''
   An investment group led by Los Angeles businessman Alfred
Checchi recently completed its $3.6 billion tender offer for
Northwest's parent, NWA Inc., and appeared to have won control of
NWA.
   Insurance coverage for retired pilots, wages and a ``B'' wage
scale for new pilots are among the major remaining issues in the
negotiations.
   Northwest has offered a 5-year reduced pay scale for new pilots
at 70 percent of the existing scale. The Air Line Pilots
Association wants a 3-year scale at an 80 percent rate.
   The contract talks broke off last week and ALPA has asked the
National Mediation Board to declare an impasse so that a 30-day
cooling-off period would begin. At the end of 30 days the pilots
could legally strike.
   Henning noted that Northwest and ALPA have agreed to a 9.4
percent wage increase in the first year of the contract. The wage
increase for the remaining three years of the contract remains
unsettled. The company has offered increases of 3 percent, 2
percent and 3 percent, respectively, through 1992. The pilots want
4.5 percent, 5 percent, 4.5 percent and 2 percent through 1993.
   Also in dispute is a lump-sum payment to replace retroactive pay
for the 29 months during which the old contract has been expired.
Northwest has offered $5 million to be distributed among pilots
according to their own formula. The pilots are seeking $30 million.
   ``The company remains optimistic that progress can yet be made
that will ultimately lead to an agreement in these remaining
areas,'' said Henning.
   ALPA spokesman Andy Murphy said Tuesday that the letter was
``largely factual,'' but he said it overlooks unattractive portions
of the company's latest offer.
   ``They certainly have painted a brighter picture than we see
it,'' Murphy said. ``For all the highlights there are a lot of
lowlights and we have problems with some of those things.''

<HEAD>MCorp Says Its Five Remaining Banks Earned $1.5 Million In Second
Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: MCorp, no period, is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCorp, the bank holding company stripped of most
of its banks by federal regulators, said Tuesday it earned $1.5
million in the second quarter, its first full quarter of operation
after the reorganization.
   The company, which has filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection, was left with five banks after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. seized 20 MBanks in Texas on March 28. The rescue
is expected to be the second most expensive thrift bailout in the
nation's history.
   Those five banks earned $1.5 million, or 3 cents per share, in
the three month ended June 30, the company said.
   In the first three months this year, the same five banks had a
loss of $34 million, MCorp said, releasing the numbers for the
first time Tuesday.
   The losses during that period reflected a ``very harsh''
examination by federal regulators, who forced the company to write
down assets more severely that bank officials thought necessary,
MCorp spokesman Joe Stroop said.
   ``We took a big hit in the first quarter that in our view should
not occur again,'' he said.
   Deposits at the five banks fell from $2.75 billion at year's end
to $2.62 billion on March 31 and $2.5 billion on June 30.
   Assets dropped from $3.5 billion at the end of 1988 to $3.1
billion on March 31 and $3.06 billion on June 30. Non-performing
assets were $167 million in the second quarter, up from $147
million in the first quarter and $130 million at the beginning of
the year.
   MCorp's five banks are in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, El Paso,
New Braunfels and Waco. The company includes a statewide trust and
investment subsidiary.
   After operating the 20 MBanks as Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank
since the takeover, the FDIC sold the bank to Banc One Corp. of
Ohio. The resulting Bank One Texas has assets of about $13 billion,
although that could drop to about $10 billion after bad assets are
pruned.
   The FDIC has estimated the bailout could end up costing as much
as $2.3 billion, ranking second only to last year's rescue of First
RepublicBank Corp., with an estimated cost of $3 billion.

<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons said
Tuesday he had increased his stake in defense contractor Lockheed
Corp. to 9.46 percent.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a group
of Simmons-controlled concerns headed by Valhi Corp. stated they
now hold more than 6 million shares, or 9.46 percent, of Lockheed's
common stock.
   That's an increase from an 8.03 percent stake reported July 17
by Simmons, one of Lockheed's largest individual shareholders.
   The latest SEC filing did not state why Simmons had increased
his holdings, indicating the reason had not changed since a June 12
filing.
   In that filing, when he acquired 6.25 percent of Lockheed,
Simmons said he was buying the defense contractor's shares ``for
purposes of investment and in order to acquire a significant equity
interest in the company.''
   Equity is the ownership interest shareholders possess in a
corporation.
   In the June filing, Simmons denied having immediate plans to
take over the company by stock ownership or other means _ although
he didn't discount such a move in the future.
   Earlier this year, Simmons, a Dallas billionaire with holdings
in the chemical, timber and sugar industries, revealed he had a 5.3
percent stake in Lockheed, the Calabasas, Calif.-based maker of the
stealth jet fighter.
   That disclosure prompted Lockheed to create an employee stock
ownership plan (ESOP) that in effect blocked any takeover attempt
under Delaware law. Lockheed is incorporated in Delaware.
   The day after Lockheed created the ESOP, Simmons, whose worth is
estimated by Fortune magazine at $1.5 billion, reduced his holdings
from 5.3 percent to 4.2 percent.
   According to the latest SEC filing, Valhi Inc. controls 3.4
million, or 5.49 percent, of Lockheed. Valhi also controls NL
Industries Inc., which holds 1.29 million Lockheed shares, or 2.04
percent, and NL Chemicals, which holds 1.22 million, or 1.93
percent.
   NL Industries and NL Chemicals have purchased more than 909,000
Lockheed shares since July 17 for between $47.50 and $49, according
to the SEC filing.

<HEAD>MAI Makes New Offer for Prime's Minicomputer Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif., offered
Tuesday to buy Prime Computer Inc.'s minicomputer business for $525
million in cash, replacing its previous offer of a mixture of cash
and securities.
   The new, all-cash offer expires Aug. 9, the date of Prime's
annual meeting, which has been delayed twice because of a takeover
battle with MAI.
   MAI previously offered $450 million in cash, plus debentures
with a 15{ percent interest rate and a face value of $150 million,
for the minicomputer division.
   MAI's offer conflicts with an agreement by Prime's board of
directors to sell the entire company to J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New
York venture capital firm, for about $1.2 billion.
   Prime, based in suburban Natick, makes minicomputers and
computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. It has 11,200
employees and had revenues of $1.6 billion last year. The
minicomputer business accounted for about one-third of those
revenues.
   Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan said the company's board would
meet to review the new offer.
   Analysts have said the Whitney merger could be endangered by
Prime's continuing flow of red ink, including a $19 million loss in
the quarter that ended June 30. Two banks asked Whitney to obtain
additional financing for the deal in the wake of that loss.
   MAI, controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, launched
a hostile bid last November to buy all of Prime for about $970
million. But it gave up that offer in the wake of Prime's agreement
to merge with J.H. Whitney in a deal negotiated by Prime management.
   Prime shares closed down 50 cents Tuesday at $15.75 in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEAD>Wheeler Named to Head Financial News Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial News Network Inc. said Tuesday that
Michael Wheeler, who formerly was in charge of its business and
financial news programming, has been named president of the cable
network company.
   As president, Wheeler will also have responsibility for the
company's sports information service called FNN:Score and its stock
market quotes and information service called FNN: Data Broadcasting.
   He succeeds David Meister, who has been in charge of FNN since
December 1986 and assumed the title of FNN president in early 1988.
   Financial News Network has been expanding its business and
financial news service over the past few months, dropping a home
shopping service that once ran in the overnight hours on the
channel and trimming the time allotted for sports programming.
   Those changes were made as established cable networks such as
Cable News Network beefed up their business news coverage and a new
cable network, called the Consumer News and Business Channel, was
launched with backing from the National Broadcasting Co., which
operates the NBC Television Network.
   FNN officials said their network lost 2 million cable
subscribers when CNBC made its debut in mid-April but that they
have since recaptured about 750,000 of them and added nearly 2
million more as part of the network's normal growth.
   FNN currently is on cable systems with about 33 million
subscribers, while CNBC is on systems with about 13 million
subscribers.
   Wheeler, 38, has been with FNN for more than two years. He
previously worked for CBS Inc., Meredith Corp., Warner Amex
Satellite Entertainment Co. and the Showtime Networks.
   Meister, 49, has been given new responsibilities for strategic
planning at Infotechnology Inc., which owns a controlling stake in
FNN. He retains his title as executive vice president at
Infotechnology, and remains on its board.
   ``This move is clearly a reflection of the progress of FNN,''
Meister said in a telephone interview.
   In a separate announcement, Infotechnology said it had divided
its operations into four new operating groups: technical products
and services; information and news products; marketing services;
and media networks.
   ``These changes in Infotech's operations are a key part of our
business plan, as we look forward to completing our translation
from a business development company into an operating company,''
said John F. Berentson, Infotechnology's chief operating officer.
   FNN's Wheeler will head the media networks group, which includes
Infotechnology's interests in FNN, an FNN business radio network
and The Learning Channel, another cable TV network.
   Joseph K. Taussig was named to head the information and news
products group, which includes Infotechnology's interest in United
Press International.
   Infotechnology acquired WNW Group in March. WNW Group's
principal assets were a proxy to vote substantially all of the
stock owned by New UPI Inc., the parent of United Press
International, and an irrevocable option to acquire shares that
would result in the ownership of 99 percent of New UPI.
   James R. Pompa will head the technical products and services
group and Alan Vera will head the marketing services group.

<TEXT>
   The trustee for a Florida federal bankruptcy
court says millionaire businessman Marvin Warner is trying to
strike a deal with creditors to prevent the seizure and sale of
Warner's assets.
   But trustee Daniel L. Bakst, a West Palm Beach, Fla., lawyer,
said he will not let the 11th-hour settlement efforts interfere
with his assignment to track down Warner's assets for distribution
to creditors.
   ``Mr. Warner wants to stop me,'' Bakst said in an interview with
The Cincinnati Post published Tuesday. ``Just because Warner is
flopping around trying to make deals doesn't mean I can't do my
job. We are going forward.''
   Warner, 70, who owned the failed Home State Savings Bank of
Cincinnati, had filed in October 1987 a petition for protection
from his creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
Warner, who now lives in Ocala, Fla., and filed the petition in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Fla., sought protection from
creditors seeking more than $4 billion from him.
   Home State's March 1985 collapse precipitated a crisis among
Ohio thrifts. Warner's creditors include the state of Ohio, which
obtained a March 1987 court order that Warner pay back to the state
$22 million needed to guarantee Home State deposits.
   Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was convicted
on Ohio felony charges in Home State's collapse, but was acquitted
of federal charges in a separate trial. He is appealing the Ohio
convictions.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor on Friday authorized
appointment of Bakst as trustee. On Monday, Proctor signed an order
that converted Warner's Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7
proceeding. Bakst is to conduct a meeting of lawyers for Warner and
the creditors Aug. 24 in Jacksonville.
   Warner, reached by phone at his Ocala home Tuesday, declined
comment. However, he told a newspaper in his Florida home town that
he is not trying to impede any court proceeding.
   ``During all of this litigation I have never impeded any of the
proper procedures in any way,'' Warner told the Ocala Star-Banner.
He declined to comment further.
   One of Warner's lawyers, Andrew Hall of Miami, Fla., confirmed
Tuesday that Warner is trying to settle the case. Hall said he did
not know the amount of money Warner is offering.
   ``There is a very substantial offer being made,'' Hall said. ``I
understand they're working on it. If they work this out, it's all
over.''
   Hall said any settlement would have to be approved by the judge
and then would be subject to acceptance by his creditors.
   Lawrence Kane Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio's special prosecutor in
the Home State case, declined comment on any settlement
possibilities. Proctor ruled in August 1988 that Warner's
bankruptcy reorganization would not allow him to avoid paying
restitution to Ohio. Kane said that judgment would not be affected
by any Warner settlement.
   ``There is no one who can compromise that judgment,'' Kane said.
``That debt is still outstanding, and we intend to collect it.''

   Home Shopping Network's $1.5 billion
lawsuit accusing GTE Corp. of failing to provide adequate equipment
to handle a large volume of calls went to a jury Tuesday.
   In closing arguments, a GTE attorney blamed HSN's telephone
problems on the video retailer's failure to inform GTE officials in
advance of plans to enter 11 new markets in 1986.
   The case went to the six-member jury after a six-week trial
before Pinellas Circuit Judge Howard Rives. After about two hours,
the panel was excused, with deliberations to continue Wednesday
morning.
   Home Shopping attorneys said in final arguments Monday that GTE
told ``little white lies'' to the network to cover up the
communications company's failure to provide for the volume of calls
in 1986 and 1987.
   But GTE attorney Roy Reardon said Tuesday that HSN said in a
Dec. 2, 1986, letter that the telephone company had been
``responsive to all our previous needs'' and was lookimg forward
``to continuing this highly successful relationship.''
   Ten months later, HSN filed suit claiming it lost millions of
calls and some $500 million in potential sales because the GTE
telephone network equipment was ineffective.
   Named as defendants were the Stamford, Conn.-based parent
company, its Florida subsidiary and GTE Communications. GTE has
filed a slander and libel counterclaim that blamed HSN's decline in
the electronics market and stock market on mismanagement.
   Reardon said HSN's purchase of 11 UHF stations in new markets,
combined with its entrance in the cable television market, caused
the number of subscribers to soar from 9 million to 46.5 million in
one year.
   He said GTE knew about the cable arrangements. A $1 million
stock option offered to cable companies enhanced their interest in
HSN, he said, and 70 cable outlets were obtained.
   But even when HSN made its initial public stock offering on May
13, 1986, the company failed to mention plans to purchase the UHF
stations as a second operational network, Reardon argued.
   He said an HSN official warned in September 1986 that the
network didn't have enough people to answer the growing number of
calls, but board chairman Roy Speer ``didn't want to hear they
needed more operators.''
   Competition from similar retailers also has led to HSN's decline
in sales, Reardon said.
   Responding to HSN charges GTE didn't mention the overload
problem to protect its business, Reardon said HSN was aware of
alternative services before it contracted with GTE in 1985.
   When club members rose to 126,000 in November 1985, he said, HSN
signed contracts to purchase three OMNI automatic call distribution
systems from GTE.
   The first was installed in the middle of Februrary 1986, and HSN
launched its UHF network with the second OMNI on March 1, about 10
weeks before going public.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stock Prices Lower in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar dropped in early trading against
the Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices were marginally
lower.
   The dollar opened at 135.58 yen, down 1.07 yen from Tuesday's
close of 136.65 yen. The dollar closed at 135.93 yen in New York
overnight, down from Monday's finish of 136.94 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's drop followed the release
Tuesday of the monthly report of the National Association of
Purchasing Management, which showed weakness in U.S. manufacturing.
   The report showed that the Purchasing Managers' Index fell from
48.8 percent in June to 46 percent last month, the lowest level
since January 1983.
   ``The latest report indicated that the American economy is
surely entering a slowdown,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the market was moving in
anticipation of a further U.S. interest rate decline.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 55.41 points Tuesday, shed another 20.72 points,
or 0.05 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to
34,877.74 points.
