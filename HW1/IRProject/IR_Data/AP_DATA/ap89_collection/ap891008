<TEXT>
   The tower of Pisa has been leaning for 800
years, so the keeper of the marble wonder can't understand what all
the latest fuss is about.
   It's true that experts have been making dire predictions for
years. But there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of
public works, Giovanni Prandini, sounded an alarm recently that
scared all of Italy.
   Newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a ``red
alert'' for the tower, raising fears that one of the symbols of
Italy could, at worst, topple, or at best, be closed for repairs.
   But Giuseppe Toniolo, chairman of the committee responsible for
preservation of the monument, says there's nothing to get excited
about.
   ``There is absolutely nothing new in the situation,'' he said in
an interview. ``To say that the tower is in danger, so what? It's
always been in danger.''
   ``What does the tower need?'' Toniolo added. ``It needs to be
left in peace.''
   The 180-foot circular tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173,
started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted
underneath. It was completed by Tomasso d'Andrea with the
construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370.
   The tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but
Toniolo and other tower experts say it would not topple for more
than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate.
   According to the last measurement in June, the tower leaned an
additional 0.008 inches in the last 12-month period. The average
yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0.047 inches.
   ``The thing should fall over,'' Toniolo said, seated behind a
desk in his office, the tower visible through Gothic windows. ``How
long will this lean last? No one can say. But at a certain time, it
will reach the point where it falls. That will take more than 100
years. It could be 200, 250 years.''
   For decades, Italy has tried to come up with ways to save the
tower. A number of national and international commissions have
proposed plans for stabilizing the monument, but none has ever been
implemented.
   ``The problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make
the hands of great technicians tremble,'' said Gero Geri, a
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower
since 1969. ``Who wants to risk doing something that could upset
the equilibrium?''
   The latest plan, approved by the government in 1987, is to
implant a wheel-shaped support below the base around the tower. It
would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation.
   The Public Works Ministry appointed a commission a few months
ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can
go ahead.
   But Toniolo believes the tower can't be fixed until officials
figure out what has kept the 14,000-ton structure standing all
these years.
   ``All the technicians say it can't be understood,'' said the
white-haired, 80-year-old retired radiologist who has headed the
monument preservation committee for 12 years. ``This means there
are special conditions of the terrain which haven't yet been
explained. If you can't understand this, how can you do a project
to save it?''
   Prandini, a Christian Democrat who has been public works
minister for barely two months, apparently wants to find a solution.
   After expressing his concern over the state of the tower,
Prandini ordered a panel of technical experts to report back
quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan. He also told
them to devise a round-the-clock monitoring system for the tower.
   Mayor Giacomino Granchi, a Socialist, accused Prandini of
exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself.
   Prandini replied, ``I don't see why one wants to make a
controversy out of a well known problem only because there's the
will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete
realization.''
   The sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in March of
the 900-year-old tower of Pavia in northern Italy, killing three
people. Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because of
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water
table.
   ``The example of Pavia doesn't count because no one ever
monitored it,'' Toniolo said. ``No other tower in Italy is
monitored like Pisa's. If Pavia had all the instruments that we
have, they would have known a few months before'' that it was in
danger.
   Toniolo said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from
people around the world, mostly Americans, for saving the tower.
   The latest: erecting a huge statue of Saint Ranieri, Pisa's
patron saint, with arms raised to hold up the tower.
   Some even suggest trying to straighten the tower, a notion that
makes Toniolo shudder.
   ``Never, for heaven's sake,'' he said. ``It was born tilted. Our
ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago. It must remain
that way.''

   As Moscow's first snowfall ushered in an early
winter last week, Soviet officials worried openly that the nation
could face dangerous shortages of food, fuel and heat in the colder
weeks and months to come.
   Attention focused on a breakdown of the transportation network
as supplies of every kind bottlenecked at railheads and ports
throughout much of the country.
   But the looming threat also exposes President Mikhail
Gorbachev's inability so far to implement any real ``perestroika,''
or restructuring, of the Soviet economy.
   After four years of reform measures, Gorbachev has succeeded in
discrediting the old system built around a centrally planned
economy. But he hasn't instituted the market-driven replacement
that he and other reformers advocate.
   The result is most evident right now, in the dislocation of the
supply and transport system.
   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin said last week that power
stations and public utilities have 4.5 million fewer tons of coal
on hand than at this time last year.
   He said miners will have to make an enormous effort if the
people are to avoid rationing of heat, light and electricity this
winter.
   A three-week national coal miners' strike in July disrupted
production, and since then shipments have been held up by the
logjams that also affect food and consumer products.
   Voronin blamed the transport breakdown for frustrating the
Kremlin's effort to relieve chronic shortages by spending tens of
millions of precious dollars to import goods the Soviets themselves
have failed to produce.
   More than 2 million tons of imported cargo are sitting in Soviet
ports waiting to be unloaded, he said, and 130 loaded freight
trains are standing idle inside Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia
ready to leave for the Soviet Union.
   Newspapers report carloads of food rotting on trains while
consumers complain bitterly that store shelves are empty.
   The situation is even more critical in Armenia, which for two
months was all but cut off from the rest of the country by an
Azerbaijani blockade inspired by ancient ethnic hatreds.
   Voronin charged that outright sabotage is playing havoc with
government efforts to rebuild towns and cities destroyed by the
December 1988 earthquake before winter comes again.
   In an article Wednesday in the daily Sotsialisticheskaya
Industriya, the first deputy premier was quoted as saying that
water has been poured into rail cars carrying cement to the quake
zone, and building materials have been damaged.
   Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered, he said, and
even emergency vehicles have been sidelined in the hard-hit
republic.
   The Tass news agency reported Friday night that some rail
traffic bound for Armenia had been under escort by soldiers. But it
said disruption on main rail lines caused by the Azerbaijani
blockade had idled some 400 trains totaling 60,000 wagons.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported that across the
country there are 13,500 freight cars waiting to be unloaded.
   In a brief front-page article headlined ``Is It Sabotage?'' the
national newspaper said Friday that railway officials were
complaining there were no trucks to deliver goods arriving by train.
   ``Pravda correspondents saw with their own eyes unloaded freight
trains that had brought to Moscow imported furniture, cosmetics,
coffee, tea, soap, shampoo, washing powder and Soviet-produced TV
sets, refrigerators, batteries and cigarettes _ all in all, 585
cars ready to be unloaded and 700 more waiting at stations from
Moscow to Smolensk'' about 200 miles away, the newspaper said.
``More goods are stored in depots or right outside without anything
to protect them from the weather,'' it said.
   Gorbachev, trying to prevent the situation from deteriorating
further, called for a 15-month ban on strikes, saying strong
medicine is needed to prevent ``anarchy and irresponsible
management.''
   The recently elected Supreme Soviet legislature, declaring its
independence from Kremlin edicts, refused to give Gorbachev the
sweeping ban he wanted. But it did temporarily order workers in
critical industries such as coal mining to remain on the job until
legislation can be adopted defining their right to strike.

<DATELINE>MALAKAL, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matchstick-thin, naked children with
swollen bellies stand under a harsh sun, chewing dried, uncooked
fish. Their emaciated elders sit with blank stares, gazing toward
the horizon.
   Half the 50,000 people living in this wretched Nile riverport
are seeking shelter in Malakal from the horrors of a seemingly
interminable civil war, refugees in their own country.
   Sanitary services are non-existent, and malaria and typhoid run
rampant. Those who are sick have but one dilapidated hospital to
turn to, with only a handful of doctors and almost no medical
supplies.
   Malakal, capital of the southern Upper Nile region, is a
microcosm of Sudan's southland, an area the size of Texas laid
waste by 6{ years of warfare and famine.
   A massive international relief operation prevented a repeat of
the mass starvation experienced in the summer of 1988. But the
rebellion's accumulated effects continue to wreak havoc on the
region's desperate civilians.
   Government troops control Malakal, 425 miles south of the
capital, Khartoum, as they do most southern population centers.
Nevertheless, rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army stake
out areas on its perimeter as freely as they move about in more
than 90 percent of the southern countryside.
   Militarily, the war has basically been at a standstill for
months. Both sides agreed in April to quiet their guns to let
relief goods go through.
   A military junta took power in Khartoum June 30, promising to
end the war, and has extended the truce each month. The rebels have
gone along.
   But political maneuvering over how and when to talk peace
continues, leaving the people of Malakal and the rest of the south
struggling, but surviving.
   ``People may think we're all dead,'' said Joseph Maker, a
government employee, ``but we're still living, despite the war.''
   A chieftain of the Shuluk tribe told a visiting reporter: ``Life
is going on here. We are life. We are giving birth, and we are
eating. Although very little.''
   The United Nations says 250,000 southerners died a year ago of
starvation or disease in a famine caused by the war. Other Western
relief workers estimate the death toll at twice that.
   To prevent a recurrence, the U.N. agencies organized Operation
Lifeline Sudan to position 105,000 tons of relief goods in key
transit points for distribution to displaced people after
monsoon-like summer rains isolated them this year. Organizers say
80 percent of the goods was positioned in time.
   James O'Neil, regional monitor of the U.N. World Food Program,
said government and rebels are negotiating the dispatch of a third
convoy of Nile River barges with additional relief for the Upper
Nile.
   The program has had to overcome logistical and political
problems, he said. There were too few workers for unloading the
barges en route and inadequate storage facilities. Local officials
complained about unfair distribution. As displaced people flooded
the towns, the numbers of people who had to be cared for kept
changing.
   Malakal still faces life-threatening problems, especially in
health care.
   ``Malaria and typhoid are everywhere, and we have no chloroquine
(malaria medicine) or syringes,'' said Lt. Col. Galwak Deng,
military governor for the Upper Nile.
   ``We have only one general practitioner, when we need at least
24. We have some 500 (doses) of medication, which would be consumed
in one day if we were to use them, but we have more than 600
patients coming in every day.''
   Doctors and nurses said the town's lone hospital has 14 badly
equipped wards with about 500 beds. Hospital records show at least
two deaths a day from malaria or typhoid.
   Hospital staff are helped by three doctors of the French
organization Medicins Sans Frontieres and some military doctors.
   ``These deaths are only the ones in the hospital,'' said one of
the French physicians, who identified himself as Dr. Pathot. ``We
have no car at all, nor an ambulance, so if somebody is going to
die, he may do it before coming to us.
   ``We can't say how many die every day.''
   As the civilian populace struggles to survive, the army has been
trying to reopen the town's 10 schools, closed for almost three
years.
   Two primary schools have been reopened. A reporter touring them
found the classes had no desks, stools or blackboards.
   Children sat on the ground, their teachers instructing them to
read and write by using the earth as a blackboard and a stick as
chalk.

   A pickup truck collided head-on with a
school bus carrying students from a county fair Saturday,
critically injuring the truck driver. Twenty students and a teacher
were sent to a hospital for observation.
   The students and teacher were treated and released from a local
hospital. The 29-year-old truck driver was flown by helicopter to
an emergency room.
   The students had participated in the livestock competition at
the Fort Bend County Fair near Rosenberg, 10 miles southwest of
Houston.
   The southbound truck drove into the northbound lane, striking
the bus, as the two vehicles rounded a curve, Rosenberg Police Sgt.
Beverly Johnson said.

<HEAD>Disabled Guerrillas Leave For Cuba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 47 disabled
guerrillas left late Saturday for Cuba under protection of the
Mexican government and the Red Cross, government and airport
officials said.
   The 47, mostly amputees, belong to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front. They occupied the capital's Metropolitan
Cathedral for six weeks then on Tuesday moved into the Mexican
Embassy in their efforts to leave the country.
   In Mexico, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement the group,
accompanied by two nurses, was headed for Cuba.
   The statement said the group ``left tonight on a special Red
Cross flight for Cuba, where they have asked to be taken to receive
special medical attention.''
   Officials at Salvador's international airport said the 47 left
on a plane chartered by the Mexican government.
   Officials from the Mexican Embassy, Red Cross or Salvadoran
government would not speak to reporters Saturday. The guerrillas
also were told not to speak to the press.
   But one guerrilla, identified only as Israel, told reporters,
``We're going to leave for Cuba.''
   Israel, who lost a leg in combat, said the group hoped to
receive medical care in Cuba.
   It could not be determined whether the disabled men, most of
them young, received political asylum in Cuba.
   Monsignor Arturo Rivero Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador,
called the evacuation, ``one of the points of humanization in the
conflict.''
   Late last month, Rivera Damas appealed for the guerrillas to
vacate his church, saying: ``The cathedral is not a hotel.''
   Salvador's government said 2,000 soldiers, 500 guerrillas and
700 civilians have been disabled in combat during the more than
nine years of civil war. Leftist rebels have fought the succession
of U.S.-backed governments for nearly 10 years.
   Since 1984, 346 guerrillas have been evacuated to other
countries, including France, Sweden and West Germany. The last
evacuation occurred in May.

   Michelle Pfeiffer, who had three movies out last
year and has another opening Friday, is looking ahead to her next
project _ starring in the adaptation of John le Carre's best seller
``The Russia House.''
   Ms. Pfeiffer will play Katya, a Russian editor who smuggles a
manuscript to England.
   ``I liked her bravery,'' Ms. Pfeiffer said in an interview in
Friday's editions of The New York Times, adding, ``The idea of
shooting a film in the Soviet Union was also an exciting prospect

   Ms. Pfeiffer was in ``Married to the Mob,'' ``Dangerous

   After that, ``I just kind of went home and I had a life, went to
the grocery and the dry cleaner and the movies,'' she said.
   Opening next week is ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' in which she
co-stars with Jeff and Beau Bridges.
   ``I had read the script about five years prior and I fell in
love with it, because it's about people, and there are no car
chases and not a whole lot of pratfalls,'' she said.

   A plan to improve and expand Louisiana's
highways won solid approval from voters, but proposals to enhance
blacks' voting power in electing judges were rejected in Saturday's
statewide referendum.
   None of the 13 state amendments to the state constitution on the
ballot drew much organized opposition.
   The only extensive campaigns were for passage of the highway
plan; a proposal to make it easier for police to confiscate the
property of suspected drug dealers and a measure to set aside at
least $5 million a year in state mineral revenue to restore eroding
wetlands.
   The drug confiscation and wetlands issues both passed easily.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, who included the highway funding plan as part
of a tax revision package that voters rejected April 29, said it
would boost efforts to attract new industry to Louisiana and create
thousands of construction jobs.
   With about 94 percent of the votes counted, the amendment had
the support of 430,791 voters, or 71 percent, and was opposed by
174,528, or 29 percent.
   The proposal would put the state's 16-cent motor fuel tax into a
trust fund to be used solely for highways and public works
projects. It included a 4-cent gasoline tax increase to finance
$1.4 billion in transportation improvements, including four lanes
for major highways and expansion of ports and airports.
   The two judicial amendments _ defeated by 3-to-1 margins _ would
have added a Supreme Court justice and a majority black district in
the New Orleans area, and created up to 35 black-majority
sub-districts for district and appellate courts.
   The civil rights challenges that prompted the amendments came
about because there are no blacks on the state Supreme Court, only
one black among the state's 52 appellate court judges, and five
black district court judges out of 192.
   Several tax-related amendments also were on the ballot,
including measures to raise the automobile license plate fee; to
allow cities and towns to raise property taxes; and to extend from
five years to 10 years the current property tax assessment freeze
for owners who expand or improve buildings in certain districts.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II appealed Sunday for
an end to ideological divisions worldwide and said the bitter
struggle that divides north and south Korea symbolized suffering.
   ``East is divided from west, north from south,'' John Paul said
at an open air mass attended by 700,000. He appealed for the world
to give up mistrust, hostility and conflict ``to live in peace and
brotherhood.''
   ``The Korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet
able to become one in peace and justice,'' the pope said, speaking
alternately in Korean and English.
   The vast crowd, many of whom had lined up before dawn, waved
white Korean flags and some wept as the pope entered an immense
plaza for the mass.
   Hundreds of singers burst into hymn as the pope walked along a
red carpet toward a four-story stage and altar, tiered with
thousands of red, white, yellow and pink flowers and flanked by
colorful banners.
   Plain-clothed South Korean security agents carrying submachine
guns ringed the stage, and 11,000 police were deployed on the
outskirts of the plaza. Those who attended the mass had to pass
through metal detectors.
   About 2,000 priests, aided by 2,000 women in traditional Korean
gowns, served communion, while 1,200 white doves were released as a
sign of peace.
   At an earlier meeting with President Roh Tae-woo, the pope asked
the South Korean leader to make every effort to achieve full
democracy and eradicate the nation's legacy of authoritarian rule,
a Vatican spokesman said.
   John Paul told Roh that South Koreans want full democratic
rights and freedoms, the spokesman said.
   John Paul II began his Asian pilgrimage in Seoul Saturday. About
1,000 dissidents and radical students staged an anti-government
rally at Sogang University to urge the pope to speak out on human
rights abuses in South Korea.
   An equal number of riot police surrounded the campus, but made
no move to halt Saturday's protest. The students dispersed
peacefully after demanding the release of jailed dissidents,
including South Korean clergymen charged with visiting North Korea
for unification talks.
   John Paul arrived in Seoul after for the first time flying
across the Soviet Union and sending greetings to Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev in a sign of remarkably improved Vatican-Soviet
relations. He expressed hope he would soon visit Moscow.
   He immediately took up the issue of Korean reunification, which
has divided the influential Catholic community in South Korea.
   Addressing himself to the ``dear people of Korea,'' John Paul
said: ``In the face of the tragic division which continues to
separate your own people, do you not have the urgent mission to
prove to a world torn by mistrust, strife and hatred that mankind
does have the resources to end division and war, and to forge an
enduring peace?''
   The Korean Peninsula, divided in 1945, is the site of one of the
world's most bitter ideological confrontations. The capitalist
South and the totalitarian North, which fought to a bloody
stalemate in the Korean War, clash frequently and maintain huge
armies along their 150-mile border.
   They still are technically at war since no peace treaty was
signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   A heated debate broke out in the Catholic community after a
dissident priest visited North Korea in July to escort home a
radical college student. The two claimed the trip was to promote
reunification, but the Seoul government called it an illegal
contact with an enemy state.
   The priest and student were arrested when they crossed back
across the border. Three other priests were jailed for organizing
the priest's trip without government approval.
   After South Korea, the pope travels on to Indonesia and East
Timor, and then to the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius. He
is to return to Rome Oct. 16.
   The trip is the Polish-born pope's 44th foreign pilgrimage.

   Passengers used emergency chutes to exit an
American Airlines jetliner Saturday after smoke was seen coming
from the plane's landing gear, an airline official said.
   There were no injuries to the 46 passengers and five crew
members on board Flight 1333, said American Airlines spokesman Tom
Stack.
   The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 was taxiing down the runway at
O'Hare International Airport after landing from Grand Rapids,
Mich., when the pilot of a plane behind it reported seeing smoke
coming from the left main landing gear, Stack said.
   The pilot of Flight 1333 ordered passengers to evacuate the
plane by the chute slides as a precautionary measure, Stack said.
   An initial inspection of the plane determined there was no fire,
Stack said, adding the cause of the smoke was under investigation.

   A Burmese student group Sunday said the

   ``We regard this (hijacking) as a reaction to the current
situation in Burma where freedom of speech is totally impossible,''

   On Saturday, Thailand said it would not repatriate the students,
who hijacked a Burmese domestic flight with 83 others aboard then
threatened to blow up the plane if their demands for reform were
not met.
   The Front is the major representative of students who fled
central Burma to fight for democracy from camps along the country's
borders after the military brutally crushed a student-led uprising
there last year.
   It claims that nearly 5,000 students and other dissidents are
living in 24 frontier camps under the protection of various ethnic
minority groups also battling the military-led government.
   ``Their demands are identical to those of the people of Burma,
and these are the demands we have been relaying the world with our
tears and blood since the brutal military takeover in Burma,'' said
the release, seen in Bangkok.
   An official media report from Burma Sunday said the hijacking
was settled successfully because of good relations between Thailand
and Burma.
   A Radio Rangoon broadcast gave details of the hijacking Friday
by the students, who diverted a Fokker 28 domestic airliner to
Thailand and held 83 people hostage for about 10 hours before
surrendering to Thai officials.
   The students are being held in military custody, but Thai
officials have said they would not be repatriated.
   ``We will not hurt them. They will not be sent back to Burma,''
Deputy Prime Minister Tienchai Sirisunpan said in a news
conference. ``The Burmese government also does not want them back.
So far they have not asked for asylum in any country.''
   Although Thailand has friendly relations with Burma, it does not
have an extradition treaty with the military government in Rangoon.
   ``As I understand it, they want to let the world know what has
happened in Burma, especially the life without freedom of Burmese
citizens,'' Tienchai said.
   The hijackers demands included the release of political
prisoners, lifting of martial law, freedom of the press and the
formation of an interim government with persons nominated by the
United Nations, the radio broadcast said.
   The hijackers also wanted the release of opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, the ``governing of the people leniently'' and
``ordering soldiers back to the barracks.''
   A military junta seized power in Burma in September 1988
following a nationwide uprising to demand an end to a quarter
century of authoritarian rule.
   The military has promised general elections next year, but in
July placed under house arrest its leading opponent, Suu Kyi, and
has arrested several thousand other dissidents, according to
Western sources.
   The two students initially threatened to blow up the aircraft
with what Thai officials say was a homemade explosive.
   Thailand is one of the few nations which has tried to establish
friendly ties with the military regime and has shown particular
interest in exploiting Burma's rich natural resources, including
teak and fish. Thailand's powerful military has been at the
forefront of efforts to develop closer ties.

   East German leader Erich Honecker told Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on Saturday he would stick to his
hard-line course as police battled thousands demonstrating for
reform on East Germany's 40th anniversary.
   Scores were arrested and dozens injured by police who punched,
kicked, beat and dragged away protesters in East Berlin and at
least three other cities, witnesses and television reports said.
One Western journalist reportedly was detained.
   An estimated 10,000 people joined the protests.
   Some 5,000 demonstrators, many shouting ``Gorby, Gorby,''
crowded into the Alexanderplatz square in East Berlin late
Saturday. The Soviet leader, whose reform policies have made him a
hero to many East Germans, ended his two-day visit Saturday evening
and headed back to Moscow.
   Plainclothes police and uniformed riot officers used force to
disperse the East Berlin demonstrators.
   Police bashed one man's head against a wall. Other protesters
were kicked by security police, dragged along the ground to side
streets and taken away to jails.
   Some East Berlin residents watched the violence from apartment
windows. They waved sparklers to show support for the demonstrators.
   Catherine Field, a reporter for the British newspaper Observer,
earlier said authorities detained three Western journalists. But a
spokesman for NBC later said only Peter Millar of the Sunday Times
of London was held. The report could not be confirmed with East
German authorities.
   
   In the most widespread protests to hit East Germany in years,
clashes also were reported in Leipzig, Dresden and Potsdam.
   Also Saturday, West Germany's foreign minister said there were
signs East Germany would ease emigration restrictions. A West
German newspaper said the plans were intended to clear out those
who have criticized conditions in their Communist homeland.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans has deeply
embarrassed the aging leadership in East Berlin during weekend
anniversary celebrations.
   However, the official East German news agency ADN said that in
three hours of talks, Honecker told Gorbachev East Germany will
adhere to ``the basic values'' of socialism.
   ``The hopes of bourgeois politicians and ideologues who are
aiming for reforms heading to bourgeois democracy and on to
capitalism are built on sand,'' Honecker was quoted as saying.
   ``The Socialist Unity Party will consistently follow the proven
course for the good of the people, in the unity of economic and
social policies, continuity and renewal,'' he said.
   While making clear his aims for communist East Germany, Honecker
also expressed support for the Soviet Union's reforms.
   ADN said the meeting took place in an atmosphere of
``traditional friendship.''
   A day earlier, Gorbachev urged Warsaw Pact ally East Germany to
work with ``all forces in society.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said Gorbachev repeated to Honecker a Russian saying that ``he who
is late is punished.''
   Asked whether that referred to the East German government's
repeated rejection of reforms, Gerasimov said: ``No, we were
talking about our experiences. But journalists do interpret
things.''
   Gerasimov said the issue of the refugee exodus did not come up
in the session he attended, the second of two.
   About 4,000 protesters battled police Saturday in Leipzig,
according to witnesses and West Germany's ZDF television network.
The witnesses said there were numerous injuries and arrests but it
was not clear how many.
   Police, carrying truncheons and wearing riot helmets and
shields, waded into the crowd of protesters and beat them at
random, witnesses said.
   Groups of 10 to 15 policemen were seen chasing demonstrators,
who offered no resistance but shouted ``No violence,'' ``Shame on
you'' and ``Gorbachev, Gorbachev!'' the witnesses said.
   About 2,000 demonstrators battled police and soldiers overnight
in Dresden and an unspecified number were injured, witnesses said.
It was the fourth night of violence in Dresden.
   Hundreds of police officers attacked the demonstrators, who
responded by hurling bottles and other objects, witnesses said.
They said the street battles lasted for several hours.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Saturday in a TV interview there were signals East Berlin was about
to ease emigration restrictions for its citizens.
   The West German Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that East
Berlin was planning ``a massive expulsion of annoying citizens.'
   It is thought that more than a million people have asked to
leave East Germany, although the government has not provided any
statistics.
   Western tourists were barred from Communist East Berlin for a
third day. New barriers were put up overnight at the Checkpoint
Charlie crossing.
   A disturbance broke out at the checkpoint Saturday when a man
with a crowbar hacked and hammered at the new metal barriers from
the Western side.
   A crowd of about 200 people on the western side taunted East
German guards watching the disturbance, and pelted them with pieces
of metal, cans and clumps of dirt. The guards did not react.
   Tanks, rocket transporters and goose-stepping East German
soldiers paraded down East Berlin's Karl Marx Boulevard early
Saturday in a celebration of East Germany's founding on Oct. 7,
1949. Gorbachev and Honecker observed the military display.
   The military nature of the parade drew a protest from Western
allies Britain, France and the United States, who called it a
``provocation as well as a violation of the city's demilitarized
status.''
   ADN said the parade showed the country's determination ``to
always protect what the workers have produced in four decades.''
   But the government had difficulty portraying the nation as a
socialist success.
   More than 47,000 people have fled East Germany since
mid-September, across Hungary's western border or through West
German embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland. Many have complained
of repression and a low standard of living.
   Bavarian border police said Saturday that 662 East German
refugees arrived in the West German state over the past 24 hours,
all through Hungary. Budapest opened the border Sept. 11.

   A Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed and
exploded Sunday during a final acrobatic maneuver on Indian Air
Force Day, killing the pilot who had attempted an extra roll,
officials said.
   No one on the ground was killed, but some of the 2,000
spectators suffered sprained ankles or bruises running to or from
the site, they said.
   The silver delta-winged aircraft of French design was completing
a climb known as a ``Vertical Charlie'' when it plunged to the
ground about 300 yards from a reviewing stand at Palam Airport in
west New Delhi.
   Military and civilian dignitaries, journalists and other guests
had watched the parade of 650 enlisted men and an aerial display.
   The pilot, identified as Wing Commander Ramesh Bakshi, the
39-year-old commander of the Mirage squadron, was killed instantly,
Air Force Chief Marshal S.K. Mehra said.
   He told reporters the accident apparently was caused by ``an
error in judgment.''
   Mehra said the sky was hazy and may have disoriented Bakshi. The
plane was about 18 feet from the ground when the pilot tried the
maneuver, he said.
   The Mirage was completing the final flyby during the parade
marking the 57th anniversary of the Indian air force and honoring
its 115,000 officers.
   Air Marshal N.C. Suri, vice chief of the air staff, said Bakshi
was only supposed to perform three rolls in the finale. Instead,
the officer said, he attempted four.
   The plane made a steep climb, then descended making three loops
and rolls, he said. After failing to complete a fourth roll, the
pilot was unable to pull out of the descent and the plane hurtled
to the ground, he said.
   Some spectators gasped and several air force wives ran toward
the burning wreckage.
   The aircraft slammed into the ground, exploded and bounced three
times through fuel tanks, igniting a huge fireball. Several
vehicles parked in the area were badily damaged by the burning
chunks.
   The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 miles an hour at an
altitude of 65,600 feet.
   The Indian air force bought 49 Mirage 2000 planes between 1982
and 1986.

   Tamil guerrillas abducted 18
journalists from their newspaper office and said they would be put
to work on a new Tamil publication, a reporter who fled during the
raid said Sunday.
   The armed militants burst into the Jaffna offices of Eelanadu,
Sri Lanka's oldest Tamil language newspaper, on Thursday, the
journalist said in Colombo.
   He said he was one of five reporters who bolted to freedom
before the abductors drove away with the reporters. The journalist
asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety.
   ``I want to go back to Jaffna and my newspaper,'' he said.
   The Colombo office of Eelanadu, which means Sri Lanka in Tamil,
confirmed the attack but gave no details.
   The journalist said the gunmen belonged to the Eelam Peoples
Revolutionary Liberation Front, which is supported by India and
opposes the largest Tamil militia, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
   According to the journalist, the abductors said they were going
to publish a new newspaper called Viduthalai, which means
liberation in the Tamil language. He has provided reliable
information in the past.
   The Tigers are fighting Indian peacekeeping troops sent to Sri
Lanka to disarm them in 1987. The Liberation Front and other Tamil
militants accepted the Indian-brokered peace plan.
   The Front and the Tigers once jointly sought independence for
the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka, where the government and military
are dominated by the Sinhalese majority.
   The ethnic violence in Tamil-dominated northeastern Sri Lanka
has claimed more than 11,000 lives in the past six years.
   The Liberation Front closed Eelanadu and two other Tamil
newspapers in Jaffna, 180 miles northeast of Colombo, on Sept. 20
after the publications carried paid advertisements commemorating
the second anniversary of the death of a Tiger rebel leader.
   In February, the Tigers blew up Eelanadu's offices after the
newspaper carried stories that the Tigers considered pro-Indian.
Eelanadu, which was founded 30 years ago and has a circulation of
10,000, resumed publication in May with a skeleton staff.

   Five Pakistani lawyers have been
charged with robbing a bank, stealing 14 automobiles and killing
one of their accomplices, a newspaper report Sunday.
   They were arrested over the weekend in Multan, a city in
southern Punjab, according to the English-language daily newspaper
Dawn.
   Deputy Police Superintendent Hafeez Rajput said the arresting
officers recovered four cars, firearms and $33,000 in cash.
   Among other things, the five were accused of robbing a Pakistan
National Bank branch of $67,000 on July 2.
   Rajput said the suspects told police they set aside half the
money for a trip abroad and half for spending in Pakistan.
   But when a sixth member of the ring began spending lavishly in a
manner that could draw suspicion, they murdered him and hid his
body, according to the report. It said the investigation was
continuing.

   Police said they arrested 28
people Sunday in connection with the recent leaks of security files
identifying alleged Irish Republican Army suspects.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary would not comment on British news
reports that the detainees were members of the Ulster Defense
Regiment, the locally recruited and mostly part-time force of the
British army.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said 300 uniformed and plainclothes officers were involved
in raids on 30 houses during which security documents and
ammunition were also seized.
   Charges had not been filed.
   The raids follow an investigation by Deputy Chief Constable John
Stevens of the Cambridgeshire, England, police force into
allegations that a group of police and Ulster Defense Regiment
members leaked secret files on IRA suspects to the media.
   Protestant gunmen have claimed they used such documents to pick
targets, including a Roman Catholic man slain in August.
   Stevens said in a statement that ``a number of men'' were
arrested and houses searched in the greater Belfast area as part of
the inquiry.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland. The 20-year struggle has claimed more than
2,700 lives.

   Artur Yusupov took a timeout Sunday, postponing
until Tuesday the fifth game of his World Chess Championship
Candidates' semifinal with fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov.
   Organizers said the fifth round of the other semifinal between
Jan Timman of the Netherlands and British Grandmaster Jon Speelman
would be played as scheduled Sunday night.
   Each semifinalist is allowed to take one timeout during the
eight-game contests. Yusupov, who trails 1.5-2.5, is the first of
the four candidates' to do so.
   A win scores one point and a draw one-half point.
   Timman led Speelman 2-1 with an unfinished game from the fourth
round Saturday. Play in the adjourned game was scheduled to resume
on Monday.
   The winners of the semifinals will face off in the final in
March. The winner of that series will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov in a 24-game match in October 1990.
   Yusupov will use the extra time to prepare for the fifth game,
in which he will open with the advantage of the white pieces.
   But the free days will also permit Karpov, playing below par in
London despite his lead, time to try to recover his form.

   Rickshaw drivers struck for eight hours

   Most motorists stayed off the streets fearing unrest, but none

   Government offices remained open, staffed by employees who were

   The bicycle-powered rickshaws are the most common form of
transportation in Dhaka, a city of 6 million people.
   The drivers were protesting efforts to outlaw unlicensed
rickshaws. Only about a third of the capital's 100,000 rickshaws
are licensed.
   The strikers also protested a rule barring them from certain
streets, including one running past Dhaka's two luxury hotels. The
ban forces them to pedal a mile or more out of their way to reach
their passengers' destinations.
   About 200,000 men and their families depend on rickshaws for

   Palestinian leaders urged the United States on
Sunday to pressure Israel to begin peace talks and said Israel's
rejection of a proposed meeting with Palestinians in Egypt will
lead to more violence in the uprising.
   A leading Labor Party politician, Moshe Shahal, said U.S. help
in choosing Palestinian delegates to talk with Israel could
``rescue the political situation'' following Friday's rejection of
the Egypt-sponsored dialogue.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, businesses were closed
by a general strike, the first of a three-day shutdown ordered by
the uprising's PLO-backed underground leaders to step up the revolt
against Israeli rule of the lands.
   The Israeli army closed off the territories Sunday afternoon,
blocking Palestinians from entering Israel on Yom Kippur, the
Jewish day of atonement, which began at sundown.
   Radwan Abu Ayyash, one of the Palestinian leaders reportedly
suggested by Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak to meet with Israeli
representatives, said only U.S. pressure would lead to the dialogue
suggested by the Egyptian president.
   ``The United States must take a more active and serious role to
convince the Israelis to hold the meeting proposed by Mubarak,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   Abu Ayyash _ head of the West Bank's Arab Journalists
Association and a supporter of Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine
Liberation Organization faction, Fatah _ urged the U.S. government
to step up its dialogue with the PLO ``to counter the Israeli
decision.''
   Mubarak's offer was rejected because Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc objected to the Egyptian leader's
call to include Palestinians deported from the occupied territories
in peace talks. Shamir said including the exiles would amount to
allowing the PLO into the peace process.
   The center-left Labor Party, Likud's partner in the coalition
government, urged Israel to accept Mubarak's offer. But the
policy-making inner Cabinet vote produced a 6-6 tie along political
lines, which amounted to a rejection of the Egyptian offer.
   Assad Saftawi, a Gaza Strip school principal and another
reported choice of Mubarak for the talks, said he was shocked that
Mubarak's offer was rejected.
   ``The decision will bring waves of violence and extremism,''
Saftawi said. ``The blame is on Israel.''
   Saftawi and Abu Ayyash predicted more violence in the
Palestinian uprising if there were no progress toward peace. The
revolt, which begins its 23rd month Monday, already has led to the
deaths of 585 Palestinians and 40 Israelis.
   ``Palestinian moderation has its limits. If there is no
achievement, then our people will go back to extremism,'' Saftawi
told the AP.
   Members of Likud maintained, meanwhile, that the inner Cabinet
vote did not halt progress toward peace.
   ``The peace process ... does not depend on one vote in the
Cabinet,'' said Ehud Olmert, the minister in charge of Arab affairs.
   He told Israel radio that the government could still agree to
meet a Palestinian delegation if the members were acceptable to
Israel.
   His Likud colleague, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, blamed last
week's rejection on the ``stubbornness'' of Labor in forcing a vote
on Mubarak's proposal. He said the vote should have been put off
until after Israel received an expected U.S. proposal to assist in
forming a Palestinian delegation to the peace talks.
   But Shahal, energy minister in the coalition Cabinet, said Arens
never requested a delay and came to Friday's meeting with only a
vague notion of what the United States might propose.
   ``If there is an American proposal, which we haven't heard
explicitly from the foreign minister ... this could rescue the
political situation,'' he said.
   Shamir, speaking on the radio in a Yom Kippur address, called
Israelis ``seekers of peace'' but said Israel has survived only
through armed might.
   ``The army ... has proved to our enemies and the whole world
that it is impossible to defeat us,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Dean Files Confirm Her Power, Politics At HUD</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When then-House Banking Committee Chairman
Fernand J. St Germain asked for help from the Department of Housing
and Urban Development in June 1985, an agency official asked
Deborah Gore Dean whether he should get it.
   ``Absolutely!!!'' was her short, but emphatic, answer.
   And when Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan wrote HUD about a problem
in his state not long before an important vote, Dean swung into
action.
   ``This looks like trouble,'' she wrote an aide. ``We need Levin
too much. ... Please call him, tell him that we'll do whatever we
can.''
   But when Jesse Jackson wanted her boss, HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce, to accompany him to a housing project devastated by a
hurricane, Dean frowned at the request.
   ``Respectfully decline,'' she wrote.
   Those episodes, detailed in more than 20,000 pages of Dean's
files, are but three of hundreds of glimpses of the politics of HUD
during the Reagan administration, and of the power Dean held as
Pierce's close aide.
   Dean, who had no experience in housing and only a brief stint in
government before coming to work at HUD, is a central figure in the
congressional investigation of favoritism and mismanagement at HUD.
Like Pierce, she has refused to testify by citing her right against
self-incrimination.
   Her files show she was also a central figure in agency affairs,
keeping Pierce apprised of important developments, endorsing
projects she liked and cracking down on work that didn't satisfy
her.
   ``You all must bear down _ no more garbage for (Pierce's)
signature,'' she said in a July 1985 note to three HUD officials
who worked on a letter for Pierce. ``He deserves better work from
his assistants. Review my notes and do four Hail Mary's.''
   When a request from someone who could help HUD _ like St
Germain, whose committee controlled the agency's budget _ reached
Dean's desk, she made sure it was handled quickly, often sending
critical notes to aides who had not responded to the requests
sooner.
   She was just as keenly aware of the other side of the political
fence, rejecting Pierce appearances with Jackson and another
prominent black, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, both of
whom had major differences with the Reagan administration.
   Her files, released last week under the Freedom of Information
Act, show she was swamped with requests for help from developers,
consultants, local housing officials, city councilors and mayors,
and members of Congress.
   For some, she arranged meetings or telephone conversations with
Pierce. For others, she made sure their proposals were routed to
the proper agency official, sometimes adding her endorsement.
   ``Please give these people all the help you can,'' she wrote to
a deputy when sending him a proposal for a HUD grant, which was
later approved.
   On occasion, she even delved into the realm of social director _
securing White House tour passes for then-Columbus, Ohio, City
Councilor David E. Cain in 1983 and an invitation to a dinner in
honor of former President Nixon for one of Pierce's former law
partners in 1985.
   ``My family and I enjoyed the tour very much,'' Cain said in a
thank-you note to Dean.
   Although she wrote flowery letters to some of the most powerful
people in Washington, Ms. Dean took a jab at many of them in a note
to an aide who had sent her a copy of a Washington's magazine's
1985 list of the capital's ``Social 400,'' which did not bear her
name.
   ``With the exception of Ron &amp; Nancy (Reagan) and Bob &amp; Liddy
(Dole), I wouldn't be seen with any of them!'' she wrote.
   Among others on the list: George and Barbara Bush, Cabinet
secretaries James Baker, George Shultz and Edwin Meese, several
Supreme Court justices and dozens of senators and representatives,
not to mention the richest of the rich.
   Her notes also show signs of the sense of humor friends and
colleagues often recall.
   ``Ba Humbug! I'm not giving back anything!'' she scribbled on a
memo detailing policy against accepting gifts from government
vendors.
   She also was fiercely protective of Pierce, keeping a close eye
on HUD-related news accounts and once warning a public affairs aide
not to include in an internal newsletter some derogatory questions
employees had submitted for Pierce.
   Among them: ``Why do you stay in a job that you wanted to leave
after the election when the president is attempting to eliminate
your key programs?'' and ``Would you like to live out the rest of
your life in a deregulated nursing home?''
   When she sent a copy of the questions to Pierce, she scribbled
one of her frequent one-word notes:
   ``Incredible!''

   An anti-hazing campaign aimed at countering the image of Greek
rows as gin-soaked ``Animal Houses'' appears to be gaining this
fall on campuses from the University of Southern California to
Dartmouth.
   Worried by their image, as well as the possibility of lawsuits,
fraternities around the country are moving to eliminate hazing.
Some want to eliminate pledging, the practice of having a period
between the recruitment of a member and his formal initiation when
hazing is most likely.
   In August, two of the nation's largest fraternities, Tau Kappa
Epsilon and Zeta Beta Tau, decided that the most effective way to
end hazing was to ban pledging altogether in their chapters.
   Kappa Delta Rho also approved a long-range plan that includes a
move to no pledging by 1995. Phi Sigma Kappa amended its
constitution to allow for experimentation with non-pledge programs.
Alpha Epsilon Pi introduced new membership education programs.
   The National Interfraternity Council, which represents
fraternities at 900 college campuses, weighed in with an
anti-hazing campaign of its own in September, stressing that the
image of fraternities everywhere was suffering from hazing
incidents that harmed pledges physically or psychologically.
   ``It's not a concern for decreasing membership,'' said Jonathan
J. Brant, executive director of the Indianapolis-based council.
``We're just really fed up with the perception that silly and
dangerous things occur on the college campus, and fraternities are
sometimes associated with those things.''
   ``What has empowered us in making our case to fraternities is
that we are painfully aware that the stakes have been raised in
legal liability,'' Brant said.
   Fraternity brothers on many campuses still resist the idea of
ditching the time-honored practice of putting new members through
physical or mental ordeals before their formal initiation, despite
excesses that have led to 40 deaths and hundreds of injuries in the
last decade nationwide.
   ``I really don't think you can form any sort of loyalty to a
house without pledging,'' said Steve Colafella, a sophomore
initiated last month into Alpha Sigma Phi at Penn State University.
   ``The oneness that you show with the brotherhood, the thing you
have in common, is the trials and tribulations that got you there.''
   Some 400,000 undergraduate men and 250,000 undergraduate women
belong to Greek organizations in the United States and Canada.
After a slump in membership from 1965 through the 1970s, Greek
organizations have grown steadily over the last decade.
   Hazing has continued at some campuses this fall, including one
notorious case at the University of Mississippi, where Beta Theta
Pi pledges were abandoned bound and naked last month on the campus
of Rust College, a predominantly black school, with ``KKK'' and a
racist epithet painted on their chests.
   But many fraternities are looking for better ways to initiate
members.
   At USC, for example, Theta Xi is dropping pledging this fall and
will instead require candidates to complete educational programs to
acquaint them with active members and the mores of the house.
   Phi Sigma Kappa will scrap pledging and replace it with four
weeks of informal rushing, said chapter president Darrin Aoyama.
The house is recruiting prospective members by making friends and
inviting them to the chapter. Those who decide to rush have to pass
a test on the fraternity's traditions, history and rules.
   ``I think it's a lot more positive,'' Aoyama said. ``How can you
expect the person to be your friend after you treat him like dirt?''
   But Tau Kappa Epsilon member Terry Koh, whose fraternity will
abolish pledging in two years, said: ``The most disgusting thing in
the world is to get rid of pledging. It no longer becomes a
fraternity, it becomes a club. If you ask anybody, their pledge
semester was the funnest.''
   At the University of Alabama, where 28 percent of the 16,000
undergraduates belong to one of 46 Greek organizations, ZBT
President Brian Katz said his group is following the anti-pledging
program this fall as laid out in a 400-page manual issued by the
national fraternity.
   But some brothers don't understand why they can't do the same
things that were done to them as pledges, he said. The chapter has
about 100 members.
   ``It's like if you've been swinging a golf club one way all your
life and all of a sudden this guy comes up to you and he says
you're doing it wrong and you have to change,'' Katz said. ``You're
going to have trouble changing your swing.''
   At Tulane University in New Orleans, where 32 percent of male
and 40 percent of female undergraduates belong to Greek
organizations, ZBT President Jon Randman said the no-pledge rule is
``just about the only way a fraternity can go these days.'' The
tighter rules, he added, spare him from ``looking over my shoulder
and worrying as much as I might have been in the past when people
had been able to run pretty much free.''
   Randman said the pledge semester has been replaced with a
four-week educational period during which older members work to
make the freshmen part of the group and a cohesive class unto
themselves.
   ``Since my freshman year it has changed a lot,'' said Jeff
Switek, a senior and president of Bones Gate Fraternity, one of the
largest at Dartmouth, where 58 percent of undergraduates join
fraternities or sororities. Now, school officials insist that such
organizations give details of their rush plans.
   ``A lot of people thought what they had to go through was
humiliating and didn't want others to have to go through the same
thing,'' Switek said.

<HEAD>Israelis Pray and Fast On Day of Atonement</HEAD>

   As night fell Sunday, Jews throughout Israel
marked the start of their holiest day, Yom Kippur, with fasting and
prayers of penitence.
   Traffic on the nation's highways and streets came to a halt,
commercial flights were suspended and the border with Egypt and
bridges to Jordan were closed.
   State-run Israel radio and television and the army radio ceased
broadcasts, leaving the country without communications for the
solemn holiday, which ends at sundown Monday.
   Although most Israelis are secular, Yom Kippur is widely
observed and many flock to the nation's almost 8,000 synagogues for
prayer services. It is traditional for Jews to refrain from taking
food and water during the 24-hour holiday.
   Jews beg God for forgiveness and pray for life and peace during
Yom Kippur, also known as the ``Day of Atonement.'' It is
traditional for men to wear a white robe, called a kitle,
symbolizing purity, during holiday services and to refrain from
wearing leather shoes as a symbol of humility.
   Israeli families often take advantage of the quiet by walking
down major roadways to synagogues. In past years, cars that
ventured out on Israeli streets were sometimes stoned by religous
zealots. Appeals were broadcast on the radio to allow ambulances to
pass freely.
   Tens of thousands of Jews traditionally gather at the Western
Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The wall is the last remnant of the
temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. Many Jews spend the
entire 24-hour fast day praying at the site.
   Early Sunday, some orthodox Jews went to markets to carry out
the ancient rite of kapparot. Waving live chickens over their head,
they prayed that their sins would be transferred to the sacrificial
chicken. Afterward, the chickens were slaughtered and given to the
poor.
   Yom Kippur ends the 10 ``Days of Awe'' that begin on Rosh
Hashana, the Jewish New Year. Jews believe that during the period
God decides each person's destiny over the next year.
   The Days of Awe are traditionally filled with prayer, and many
Jews greet each other by saying ``May you be inscribed in the Book
of Life.''
   This Yom Kippur marked the 16th anniversary of the 1973 Middle
East war, which began when Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a
suprise attack on Israel.
   Fierce battles were fought on the Golan Heights and in the Sinai
desert and Arab armies briefly threatened to invade Israel itself.
   Every year at this time, bereaved families lay wreaths and
flowers at the gravesites of the almost 3,000 Israeli troops who
fell in the war.
   Israeli newspapers on Sunday printed reminiscences and
commentaries about the war, and many families placed notices in
newspapers memorializing relatives who died as soldiers.
   One of the first communal settlements in the country, Kibbutz
Mizra, put an ad in several papers listing seven members ages 19 to
48 who were killed in the war.
   ``Nearly everyone had a close friend or relative that was
killed,'' said kibbutz secretary Edna Greenbald. ``Until today, we
have still not recovered.''
   In a special broadcast to the nation, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir paid tribute to those who fell.
   To prevent a repeat of the suprise attack and halt any guerrilla
infiltrations, the military placed forces on high alert Sunday,
Israel radio said.
   Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began a
three-day strike to coincide with Yom Kippur and step up the
uprising against Israeli rule of the territories. Monday marks the
beginning of the 23rd month of the rebellion.
   The army announced Saturday that travel between the occupied
lands and Israel would be barred during the holiday.

   Pop singer Julian Lennon made $450,000 on the
sale of the mountaintop home, a former Army building that he bought
just 10 months ago, according to a published report.
   In December, the son of the late John Lennon paid $1,050,000 for
the former World War II bunker, built in the Santa Monica Mountains
by the U.S. Army and later converted to a residence.
   The young Lennon sold the one-acre property for $1.5 million,
the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified real estate sources as saying
the 4,000-square-foot residence was in bad shape, with some floors
ripped out and a rude British expression meaning ``go away''
painted on the roof to discourage photographers and fans from
flying over.

   Followers threw flowers as the Dalai
Lama, newly named Nobel laureate, paid a visit to the Buddhist
Vajrapani Institute in the Santa Cruz mountains.
   About 1,000 people lined a dirt road leading up to the temple at
the tiny retreat Saturday to greet Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai
Lama, exiled leader of Tibet and winner last week of the Nobel
Peace Prize for his non-violent efforts to free his country from
Chinese domination.
   Dressed in maroon and saffron robes and riding in a gray Jaguar,
he blew a kiss to the crowd as many threw roses.
   ``If you were a Catholic and the pope came to visit your parish,
it's about the same thing,'' said John Schwartz, one of the members
of the Vajrapani community.
   After blessing the temple, the Dalai Lama delivered a message of
peace, wisdom and compassion to an audience of 2,000 in Santa Cruz.
   ``Compassion and love is the key thing. On the family level, the
national level, the international level. It is is the key to
success and happiness,'' he said from a flower-surrounded armchair
at the Civic Auditorium.

   Once upon a time, children wrote to
Santa Claus to make their dreams come true. Now, they write to
Donald Trump.
   Third-graders at Kathleen E. Goodwin Elementary School sent
letters to the billionaire developer Friday _ by Federal Express,
no less _ asking him to buy an antique carousel to save it from
being broken up and auctioned off.
   ``Dear Mr. Trumps,'' reads one of the letters, written by
Melissa Plancon. ``Please buy the carousel. We need it bad. ... All
the kids like it. You are the riches one in the country.''
   If the carousel is sold, Valerie Hacker wrote, ``it will be
bracking children's hearts because children like amusement parks a
lot.''
   Jude Harmon was hard-nosed, trying to appeal to Trump's
legendary business savvy _ and ego.
   ``It is worth more if you buy it,'' Jude wrote. ``Children adore
it. If they destroy it they will break all 5,000 kids hearts plus
my whole school.''
   Since 1927, the wooden merry-go-round has been the main
attraction at Lake Quassapaug Amusement Park in nearby Middlebury.
   The family owned park has been hit by rising insurance premiums
that the owners say make the carousel, built in 1899, an economic
burden they no longer can afford.
   The carousel is to be auctioned off Oct. 21. Recent appraisals
put its value at more than $1 million.
   A spokeswoman for Trump said Friday that the children's plea
would be reviewed by Trump's office. Trump's executive assistant,
Norma Foerderer, said Trump receives about a thousand requests a
day for charitable contributions.

honored actress Julie Andrews with their Tribute Award for her
contribution to film.
   Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Princess Anne, presented the
award Saturday night to the 54-year-old English-born performer and
called her a ``tremendous ambassador for Britain.''
   Among the celebrities gathered at the Odeon theater in London
were actor James Coburn, who appeared with Miss Andrews in ``The
Americanization of Emily,'' and James Fox, who starred with her in
``Thoroughly Modern Millie.''
   Others who paid tribute by videotape included Dick Van Dyke,
James Garner and Dudley Moore, who starred with Miss Andrews in the
film ``10.''
   Miss Andrews began her career as a singer on the British stage
at the age of 12. At 22 she starred in the musical ``My Fair Lady''

   A fighter jet crashed and exploded in a
giant fireball at ceremonies honoring the Indian air force Sunday
after the pilot apparently misjudged the plane's altitude and tried
an extra acrobatic maneuver, officials said.
   About 2,000 military and civilian dignitaries, journalists and
other guests watched in horror as the French-designed Mirage 2000
plunged to earth about 300 yards from a reviewing stand, killing
the pilot.
   No one on the ground was killed. Some spectators suffered
sprained ankles or bruises while running either toward or away from
the burning wreckage.
   The silver delta-winged aircraft was completing a maneuver known
as a ``vertical Charlie,'' the finale of a 20-minute aerial display
of 22 of the air force's supersonic fighters, transport and
training aircraft.
   An inquiry was ordered to determine what caused the crash, the
first major accident at an Indian military airshow.
   The pilot was identified as Ramesh Bakshi, the 39-year-old
commander of the Mirage squadron.
   Air Force Chief Marshal S.K. Mehra told reporters the accident
apparently was due to ``an error in judgment.'' Mehra said the sky
was very hazy and Bakshi may have miscalculated the jet's altitude.
   When the pilot started to pull up, Mehra said, the plane was
about 18 feet from the ground. If the jet had been 12 feet higher,
Bakshi probably could have made it, he said.
   ``He was one of our most experienced pilots,'' Mehra said.
   The Mirage was completing the final flyby of Indian Air Force
Day, marking the 57th anniversary of the Indian air force and
honoring its 115,000 enlisted men. The ceremony was held at the
military section of Palam Airport in west New Delhi, and all
civilian flights were halted during the show.
   The aircraft slammed into the ground, exploded and bounced three
times through fuel tanks on the ground, igniting a giant fireball.
Two buses caught fire and several trucks and other vehicles in the
area were badly damaged by burning chunks of debris.
   The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 mph at an altitude
of 65,600 feet. The first Mirages came off the assembly line in
1966.
   The Indian air force acquired 49 Mirage 2000 fighters between
1982 and 1986. The jets are considered an essential part of India's
fleet, which includes other French-designed aircraft and some of
the Soviet Union's most sophisticated planes, helicopters and
fighters.
   Military experts from NATO and Warsaw Pact countries have rated
the skills of Indian air force pilots among the world's best. But
they gave them low marks for aircraft maintenance.
   At least 30 accidents, most involving the Soviet-made MiG-27
fighters, have occurred in the past four years.

<HEAD>Concern Over Aging Airliners Bringing New FAA Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is preparing orders that will
force airlines to regularly strip the interiors of their aging
jetliners for corrosion inspections.
   Rules are also being considered to require all new airliner
models to undergo pressurized tests on a sample aircraft that would
batter the fuselage with the equivalent of two lifetimes of
takeoffs and landings.
   These and other steps to ensure the safety of airliners that are
increasingly used long past their designed lifespans were presented
at a three-day industry and government conference last week.
   More than 300 aviation experts at the second annual
International Conference on Aging Aircraft viewed slides of
deteriorating jetliners, discussed an array of sophisticated
detection equipment and exchanged horror stories, including the
supposed discovery of a dead frog in a corrosion-prone jetliner
section now referred to as ``the guppy pond.''
   With the U.S. fleet of passenger jets exceeding 12 years old and
expected to grow older as the demand pushes airlines to refurbish
rather than retire their oldest models, Federal Aviation
Administration officials disclosed plans for new ``airworthiness
directives'' to deal with corrosion in Boeing 747, 737, 727 and 707
jetliners.
   The orders are expected next month, to be followed in February
1990 by similar directives affecting McDonnell Douglas-built jets
and later for other aircraft, said LeRoy Keith, head of the FAA's
Air Certification Directorate in Seattle.
   ``There are no plans for mandatory retirement ages, but the cost
will be going up in maintaining aging aircraft,'' Keith said.
   The corrosion orders are based on the work of an
industry-government task force that already has triggered sweeping
changes in the way older airliners are kept safe.
   Both industry and government officials stress that none of the
steps indicate that airliners now in service are unsafe but are an
effort to ensure against failures before dangers arise.
   Since the task force was set up at the first aging airliner
conference sponsored by the FAA and the industry-backed Flight
Safety Foundation 16 months ago, the government has ordered
mandatory replacements of parts on jetliners as they reach a set
number of takeoffs and landings. Previously, the FAA ordered
repetitive inspections, with replacements required only when
problems were found.
   Those orders focused primarily on problems related to metal
fatigue as an airliner is pressurized for flight and depressurized
upon landing.
   The new directives, which are expected to be adopted in other
countries where U.S.-built airliners fly, will require carriers to
set up their own anti-corrosion programs, with inspections on
various sections of each airliner at intervals ranging from three
to eight years.
   Corrosion is more closely related than fatigue to chronological
age, the quality of care the airliner is given, the environment in
which it is flown, and conditions within the aircraft.
   Frequent coffee spills in the galley or regular hauling of fish
or animal products in the cargo hold, for example, can accelerate
corrosion.
   No airliner model is immune to deterioration, said government
scientist Pin Tong.
   ``Multiple-site damage is not isolated to one manufacturer or
one model but may appear anywhere in the aging fleet,'' he said.
   Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have conducted extensive tests
on selected models to determine how many takeoffs and landings an
airliner can undergo without damage.
   A DC-9 fuselage went through the equivalent of more than 200,000
flights with ``no evidence of multiple-site fatigue damage,'' said
Dan Hagemaier, a Douglas Aircraft engineer.
   FAA officials said rules requiring such testing for all new
aircraft models are being drawn up and could affect future design.
   The Air Line Pilots Association has been calling for such tests
to set design service life for airliners.
   ALPA proposes that any extension of the service life be
certified only after a tear-down inspection of a representative
aircraft.
   J. A. Marceau, a Boeing corrosion expert, said more than 75
percent of corrosion problems been solved in new passenger planes
rolling off the assembly line.
   ``We have the majority of problems licked with new design
philosophies,'' he said.
   The new corrosion orders will classify damage at three levels,
including the earliest signs, localized damage and extensive
deterioration.
   ``An airline will have to open its planes up, inspect, repair
anything that's found, report the findings to the government, apply
corrosive-prevention compounds and then close it up,'' said Owen
Schrader, FAA aging aircraft program manager at the certification
office in Seattle.
   ``The goal is to require inspections frequently enough that
eventually we won't find anything but level-one corrosion,'' he
said.
   The orders could prove costly to some carriers, but Schrader
said most major airlines already have anti-corrosion programs and
the required inspections could be done along with other mandatory
work.
   The goal is to find an inexpensive means of quickly checking
whole airliners for both cracks and corrosion without tearing them
apart.
   FAA and National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists
indicated significant research still is needed, with a number of
methods being tested and used in current inspections.
   But Schrader said the only acceptable detection device for the
mandatory corrosion inspections is likely to be the human eye.

   The dramatic rush of refugees from East to
West Germany is causing officials to take a new look at a prospect
once considered remote _ the reunification of that divided country.
   While experts say the formation of one Germany is still not in
the cards for the near future, it is a possibility that can no
longer be dismissed as very remote.
   Any concrete moves toward reunification are likely to worry
people in countries that have twice in this century faced Germans
on the battlefield.
   Raymond G.H. Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European
and Canadian affairs, reaffirmed U.S. support for eventual
unification in testimony before a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee last week, but added that it must be approached with
caution because of ``a history in which the unification of Germany
led to instability and war.''
   ``The reunification of Germany raises the prospect of major
changes on the continent, and therefore is something we have to
look at very carefully,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle
East.
   ``We have kind of paid lip service to it without really thinking
about the implications of it,'' Hamilton said in an interview. ``I
think a lot of countries have done that.''
   The United States and West European governments have long been
on record in favor of reuniting Germany, which was split into two
countries after the Allied victory in World War II and the onset of
the Cold War between East and West.
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said in an interview, ``A lot of people in Britain,
France, most West European countries, have strong emotional
reservations'' about reunification. ``They haven't had to deal with
those reservations until very recently.''
   Like others interviewed, this official said, ``My own
expectation is that reunification is still a good many years
away.'' But he added, ``If we had been talking a couple of months
ago, I would have said it was very, very remote. The fact that
things are moving in Eastern Europe has obviously changed the
picture.''
   Hamilton said, ``I don't think reunification of Germany is going
to come about in 1990, but it is clearly going to be put on the
agenda now and discussed much more.''
   So far this year, more than 120,000 East Germans have reached
West Germany, where they are granted automatic citizenship. The
exodus has been helped by the decision of the reformist regime in
Hungary to open its borders.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has spoken
recently of the possibility of a German confederation, a step short
of complete unity.
   Ingrid Stahmer, deputy mayor of West Berlin, asked about
reunification on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' Thursday, said,
``We don't see reunification in that we would form one state again,
but I think that we must come closer....I think that we will come
together on the way to (a United) Europe.''
   But East German historian Siegfried Prokop, asked on the same
program whether unification was in prospect, replied, ``Absolutely
not. It's a dream of the ... reactionary forces in West Germany.''
   Faced with reform movements in Hungary and Poland, the Soviets
are anxious to keep East Germany in their orbit. The country has a
standard of living that is the envy of many of its East Bloc
neighbors, although it remains far below West Germany's.
   Experts said one of the major obstacles to unification is the
absence in East Germany of a strong opposition such as the
Solidarity union which has formed the new government in Poland or
the movements that are bringing about broad political reforms in
Hungary.
   ``I think we are far from a place where this East German regime
or its likely successors are going to move in that direction,''
said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Berlin-born guest scholar in foreign
policy studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and
former State Department counselor.
   ``East Germany, in this situation, I don't think has very many
good choices,'' said Hamilton.
   ``There seems to be no way out,'' said Kim Holmes, director of
foreign policy and defense studies for the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
   Still, said Holmes, ``We see the possibility for the first time
of revisiting the German question in a real kind of way. I would
have said a year ago, `Not in my lifetime.' I am beginning to
think, given how swift the events were in Poland and what has
happened with the refugees, that it could happen a lot sooner than
a lot of people think.''
   Sonnenfeldt said the recent developments ``certainly have put
that subject on people's agenda again.''
   ``If one means re-establishing the previous German Reich, even
in a somewhat smaller territory, I think that is probably not in
the cards for any time soon,'' the former State Department official
said.
   ``I think there is a lot of concern in Europe about the
reconstitution of something that resembles the previous United
Germany that existed from 1871 on and especially in the Hitlerian
period,'' he said. ``I think in the United States this is less of a
factor, but I am sure there are particular groups in this country
who would have strong feelings about it.''
   Said Holmes, ``It raises maybe concern, but concern only in the
sense that we are not sure where it might end up. And it could end
up in a number of different ways, some of which could not be in our
interest.''

<HEAD>Ad Offers Help to Hurricane Victims in Wrong Charleston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper advertisement offering
interest-free home improvement loans for Hurricane Hugo victims
targeted residents of the wrong Charleston.
   The Sears ad ran last week in the Charleston Daily Mail and The
Charleston Gazette. The storm caused some flooding and power
outages in southern West Virginia, but the real damage was in
Charleston, S.C.
   ``Due to the recent damage caused by Hurricane Hugo, we will now
offer 0 percent financing,'' the ad began. It went on to tell
customers they didn't need to wait for insurance checks to begin
repairing their homes and that the loans didn't need to be repaid
for three months.
   The ad listed a telephone number for Sears Credit Central in
Charlotte, N.C.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious in this case it's the wrong
Charleston,'' said Emerson Thomas, an advertising salesman for the
West Virginia-based Charleston newspapers.
   He said the paper was partly to blame for not spotting the error
on the page, ``but then again, they send a camera-ready
(ready-to-print) ad, an insertion order, and we just schedule it,''
he said.
   Susan Bird of the Sears store in Charleston's Town Center Mall
said the ad was probably placed by someone in the Charlotte
district, while the West Virginia stores are part of the Pittsburgh
district.
   ``We don't know at this point how it got in the paper here,''
she said Saturday.
   Sears officials said they did not know whether local stores
would honor the ad. Charleston store manager Peter Martin said he
could not comment without speaking to someone in the main office in
Chicago.

<BYLINE>Christopher Columbus Did What? ^By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Columbus Day poll suggests one-fourth of
American college seniors either never heard or do not remember the
childhood ditty: ``In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.''
   In addition to finding that one in four do not know Christopher
Columbus made his famous landing in the Western Hemisphere prior to
the year 1500, the Gallup Poll suggests considerable ignorance of
other basic facts about history and literature.
   Nearly 60 percent did not know the Korean War started when Harry
S. Truman was president, 58 percent did not know that William
Shakespeare wrote ``The Tempest'' and nearly a quarter believed a
famous saying from Karl Marx is part of the U.S. Constitution.
   ``If the students' answers were to be graded, more than half of
those tested would have failed,'' concluded the survey, which was
conducted for the National Endowment for the Humanities.
   Armed with the survey results, NEH Chairman Lynne Cheney called
Sunday for colleges and universities to revise their curricula so
undergraduates study ``essential areas of knowledge.''
   In a booklet titled ``50 Hours,'' she outlined a suggested core
curriculum for college students.
   Responding to her admonition, several college presidents
essentially told the NEH chief _ in more or less polite terms _
either to mind her own business or that she was behind the times.
   Here are some of the Gallup Poll highlights:
   _24 percent of the college seniors surveyed thought Columbus
landed in the Western Hemisphere some time after 1500.
   _42 percent could not place the Civil War in the correct half
century.
   _58 percent did not know that Shakespeare was the author of
``The Tempest,'' but 95 percent knew that Mark Twain wrote ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.''
   _58 percent did not know Truman was president when the Korean
War began. Fourteen percent thought it started when John F. Kennedy
was president.
   _55 percent could not identify the ``Magna Carta.''
   _23 percent believed that Marx' phrase, ``From each according to
his ability, to each according to his need,'' is part of the U.S.
Constitution.
   According to the survey, 39 percent of the college seniors
failed the 49-question history section. On the portion of the
survey devoted to literature, which consisted of 38 questions, 68
percent of the students failed.
   Cheney said many colleges and universities allow students to
earn bachelor's degrees without taking courses in history,
literature, science or mathematics and urged trustees and
administrators to support faculty members who are working to
strengthen general education requirements.
   Cheney's core curriculum suggests study in five basic areas of
knowledge.
   The first area, 18 semester hours on cultures and civilizations,
would start with a one-sememster survey course on the origins of
civilization in general to be followed by two semesters of Western
Civilization and one of American Civilization and then two,
one-semester courses to be chosen from among the following: African
Civilization, East Asian Civilization, Islamic Civilization, Latin
American Civilization and South Asian Civilization.
   The other four areas of basic study: foreign language, 12 hours;
concepts of mathematics, six hours; natural sciences, eight hours;
social sciences, six hours.
   The courses, Cheney said, should be taught in small classes and
in an integrated fashion, so that, for example, students reading
Descartes' philosophy in a Western Civilization course are reminded
of his contributions to mathematics. She also suggested that the
classes be taught by the college's most distinguished faculty.
   James Underwood, dean of faculty at Union College in
Schenectady, N.Y., criticized the NEH for recommending a
``superficial, rigid, and impractical'' college curriculum. He
added that Union College this fall began a general education
curriculum with an emphasis on history and literature.
   ``A reform that relies so heavily on the traditional western
civilization course runs the risk of a dangerous superficiality,''
said Underwood. ``The Western Civilization course tries to `do
everything' and demands for its success the mythical `Renaissance
man' as teacher. History should be taught by broadly educated
historians and literature by professors of literature.''
   Norm Adler at the University of Pennsylvania said, ``It is
encouraging to notice how much the report mirrors the curricula
revisions that have taken place'' at his school.
   Similar sentiments were echoed by Michigan State President John
DiBieggio, who said the school already has gotten an revised
curriculum approved by the community and board of trustees.
   Elton Bruins of Hope College in Holland, Mich., said, ``Hope
never gave way to current fads of dropping core curriculum. We've
always believed it is very important. For many years we were
probably considered old-fashioned by a lot of schools.''
   The Gallup survey included 33 questions taken from a 1986
NEH-funded survey of 17-year-olds and five questions from
examinations that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
administers to prospective American citizens.
   Grading the 87-question survey on the standard ``A'' to ``F''
scale, where scoring less than 60 percent correct constitutes a
falling grade, 55 percent of the students would have earned an
``F.'' An additional 20 percent would have received a ``D.'' Only
11 percent of the respondents would have earned an ``A'' or ``B.''
   The Gallup survey of 696 seniors was conducted between April 4
and April 27, using a self-administered test booklet. It had a 4
percent margin of error. The participating students attend 67
four-year American colleges and universities, both public and
private.

   Two armed men wearing masks resembling former
Presidents Reagan and Carter attempted to rob a bank but a
fast-acting employee locked them out. One man was shot in the arm.
   The men apparently staked out the Mid-City Bank and waited for
employees to arrive Saturday, Police Sgt. Richard Dragoun said.
   When one woman arrived about 7 a.m., the men grabbed her and
held her in a lobby between inner and outer doors, Dragoun said.
When they tried to push their way into the main lobby, the woman
escaped and locked the inner lobby door behind her, he said.
   One of the men fired a shot through the doors, striking bank
president James Fitl in the right arm. Relatives said he was in
good condition at Clarkson Hospital.
   No arrests had been made by Sunday, police said.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos criticized
the government's schooling of Native Americans on Sunday and called
for a study that he said ``could prove revolutionary for Indian
education.''
   Cavazos used the 21st National Indian Education Association
Conference in Anchorage, Alaska, to call for a ``federally directed
gathering campaign'' and a special task force ``involving the
participation of Native American citizens and educators'' to
analyze the problems that Native Americans face with education.
   A copy of his speech was released in Washington.
   Cavazos said the results of the survey he called for could have
the same impact as the a 1983 government general education report
that ``shocked the American public and led to the education reform
movement that has come to many areas of the country.''
   ``I see this developing into an `Indian Nations At Risk' study,
which will follow the path laid out by the landmark study of the
national education structure, `A Nation At Risk,''' said Cavazos.
   The education secretary said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan has
agreed ``that we must move in this direction and the two
departments, Education and Interior, must work together to address
the needs in Indian education.''
   Cavazos and Lujan are the Bush administration's only Hispanic
Cabinet members. The education secretary, a Texan like President
Bush, was first appointed by former President Reagan as the first
Hispanic to the Cabinet.
   Briefly recounting the history of Native Americans, Cavazos
said, ``Long before the appearance of the Anglo on the shores of
the North American continent, you nations had instituted systems of
education.
   ``The first treaty signed with the newly independent United
States in 1794 by the Oneida, Tuscarora and Stockbridge tribes
provided for Indian education,'' he said.
   ``The respect for knowledge held by Native Americans makes the
failures of effective education policies for the Indian nations
these past two centuries all the more tragic,'' said Cavazos,
noting an article that described ``the history of Indian education
(as one) of crossed purposes and unfulfilled hopes that is still
unfolding today.''
   An Education Department study of high school sophomores found
that from 1980 through 1986, American Indians and Alaskan Natives
dropped out at more than double the rate for the whole test group.
   Native American students are likely to be labeled handicapped or
learning disabled, the study said. Eleven percent of Indian
sophomores in public and private schools were enrolled in special
education programs and 36 percent were classified as having some
form of handicap.
   In comparison, 9 percent blacks and 7 percent of Hispanics were
in special programs.
   Cavazos said the 1980 census found only about 8 percent of
American Indians 25 years and older had completed four years of
college. He said a recent study revealed that nearly three out of
four American Indian college students do not earn degrees.
   The statistics are due partly to the government's failed
attempts to at first assimilate Native Americans and then to
urbanize them, he said.
   Now, Cavazos said, the federal government is trying to replace
assimilation with self-determination. He said these efforts are
being bolstered by the administration's education initiatives like
choice _ allowing parents to decide where to send their children to
school _ and school-based management, where principals, teachers,
parents and students set their own curricula, agendas and plans.
   He said the study he wants must provide a complete review of
government programs that affect Indian education. The focus will be
on the cost effectiveness of current efforts, as well as developing
cooperation between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Education
Department.

   Brothers Kaleo and Trevor Iwasaki grew up
in Hawaii but they think attending college in North Dakota, where
winter is serious business, is a good deal.
   After all, says Kaleo, ``you can only take so much sun and
surf.''
   Both young men from the island of Kauai are attending the small
University of Mary south of Bismarck, after being lured some 3,000
miles by football scholarships. Kaleo, 20, a junior, is majoring in
business, while Trevor, 19, a sophomore, is leaning toward a
profession in medicine.
   Both were recruited by other small colleges, but Kaleo took
Mary's offer and Trevor followed a year later. ``He said it was
fun,'' Trevor said.
   The Iwasaki brothers like North Dakota just fine.
   ``The island where we're from is laid back,'' Kaleo said. ``Up
here, it's the same way. In North Dakota, everyone's relaxed.''
   The North Dakota climate, with snow, drier air and extreme
temperatures, took some getting used to, the brothers admit.
   ``This weather is so dramatic,'' Trevor said.
   But he said the bitterly cold winters are ``no big deal''
because ``when the cold comes around, we're inside most of the
time.''
   ``It's hard for us to explain to people back home what 40 below
feels like,'' Kaleo added.

   Delbert Bode of Elgin picked and husked 524 pounds of corn in 30

Contest.
   ``It's hard work if you don't know what you're doing,'' said
Bode, who first entered the contest two years ago. ``You've got to
have pretty good coordination.''
   Cornhuskers walk down a row of corn, picking ears, husking them
clean and tossing them into horsedrawn wagons.
   Bode plans to enter the national contest in South Dakota in two

   The connection between barbecue and global
politics may seem tenuous at best, until it's described by a man
planning to take his traveling cooking contest to the Soviet Union.
   ``Like turning swords into plowshares, we say, `Turn missiles
into barbecue pits,''' said bar owner Silky Sullivan, who has
promoted barbecue contests in Ireland and Thailand and has his
sights now on Estonia, one of the Baltic states in the Soviet Union.
   The idea began to take root in September when a cooking team
from Estonia showed up at a barbecue shindig Sullivan has organized
in Lisdoonvarna, Ireland, for the past five years.
   The Estonians were invited to the Irish barbecue by an Irish
peace group that is also helping Sullivan organize the excursion to
the Soviet Union, planned for next September.
   Sullivan said he began organizing the contests in Ireland after
visiting and getting a taste of the locals' paltry attempt at
barbecue.
   ``They reached in a pot of potatoes and cabbage and pulled out
this old chunk of meat, threw it on Irish soda bread, put some red
stuff on it and said, `Now taste that,''' he said. ``When we
brought the contest to Ireland the first year, it was like aid to
Ethiopia. You wouldn't believe it. They were taking the bones home
for their soup. They loved it.''

<HEAD>Democratic Senators Vow to Protect Child-Care Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democratic leaders seeking to expedite
passage of a giant deficit-reduction bill expressed concern Sunday
that a proposed expansion of child-care benefits might be lost in
the process.
   ``Child-care legislation is of the highest priority in this
Congress _ a far higher priority than a capital-gains tax cut,''
which President Bush wants, Senate Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters. ``We don't want that to fall
between the cracks.''
   The child-care issue apparently was the main one raised in a
private meeting of Senate leaders of both parties.
   As recently as Saturday, the biggest questions facing similar
meetings were how Republicans could win the capital-gains tax cut
that President Bush wants and how Democrats could defeat capital
gains and substitute expanded Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Whatever the issues, the only agreement was that meetings would
resume Tuesday in an effort to see if hundreds of provisions
unrelated to deficit reduction can be stripped from a bill whose
main purpose is deficit reduction.
   Finishing the big deficit bill is the major business facing both
the House and Senate during the upcoming holiday-shortened week.
However, the House may get to Senate-passed flag legislation by the
end of the week.
   Unless Congress completes action by Oct. 16 on the deficit bill,
the Gramm-Rudman law will trigger automatic across-the-board cuts
in most spending programs.
   The House already has passed its deficit bill _ a package loaded
down with such extraneous issues as repealing catastrophic health
coverage for retirees; restoring the Fairness Doctrine that
requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue; extension of
several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests, and a broad
new initiative to help lower-income working parents.
   The House bill also includes a capital-gains tax cut. The cut
cannot be considered totally extraneous because it would increase
tax collections and reduce the deficit in the next three years but
lose money for at least two years after that.
   A similarly bloated bill is awaiting action in the Senate. It
contains a different child-care plan but no capital-gains tax cut.
Instead, Democrats added to the package an expansion of
tax-deductible IRAs for all workers.
   Leaders of both parties have decried the tendency to load up the
deficit-reduction bills with unrelated amendments. Now, to avoid
disruptions that the Oct. 16 automatic spending cuts might bring,
they are looking for a way to strip away the amendments and leave a
relatively ``clean'' deficit-reduction package.
   If the effort is successful, it likely will require that a new
bill be originated in the Senate to include the IRA expansion, the
child-care initiative, dozens of other tax provisions and _ if the
Republicans have their way _ a capital-gains cut.
   ``We don't have an agreement yet but everybody in there today
thought we should get one,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas told reporters.
   There was no explanation of why so much attention was given the
child-care issue in Sunday's meeting. Mitchell said only that in a
caucus Saturday, several Democrats insisted that the child-care
initiative not be lost in efforts to trim the deficit-reduction
bill.
   Child care is a popular issue with both parties this year,
although there are differences on the form in which aid should be
channeled to low-income working parents.
   The bill written by the Democratic-controlled Finance Committee
involves only three tax credits, with no increase in federal grants
to states. The tax-credit approach traditionally is the one favored
by Republicans.
   However, it is no secret that some liberal Democrats are
uncomfortable that most of the debate on deficit reduction has been
focused on the capital-gains cut, which would benefit chiefly those
making more than $100,000 a year, and on expanded IRAs, which are
aimed mostly at those between $50,000 and $75,000.
   Talking about child care allows Democrats to shift the focus to
families in the $25,000-a-year range.
   Involved in the discussions Sunday in addition to Mitchell and
Dole were Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and
senior Republican Bob Packwood of Oregon; Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn., and senior Republican Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, and Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who heads the
Appropriations Committee.

   The body of screen legend Bette Davis, who died
in France at the age of 81, will be flown to Los Angeles this week
for a private funeral, her attorney said Sunday.
   The two-time Oscar winner, who had battled breast cancer for
several years, died Friday night at the American Hospital in Paris.
   She had been en route to her West Hollywood, Calif., home from
the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been
honored for her 60-year acting career that included 10 Oscar
nominations.
   Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said final arrangements to return
Miss Davis' body to the United States could not be made until
government offices in France opened Monday.
   Miss Davis _ who appeared in more than 80 films, including
``Jezebel,'' ``All About Eve,'' and ``Of Human Bondage'' _ had
battled breast cancer since a 1983 mastectomy, Schiff said. Within
months of that surgery, she also suffered a stroke and broken hip.
   Schiff said he and Miss Davis' son, Michael Merrill, planned to
arrange a ``very private funeral and a memorial service in a week
or two.'' Both would be held on the West Coast.
   Miss Davis also is survived by two daughters, Barbara Hyman and
Margot Merrill.

<TEXT>
   Nearly six months after the brutal rape of a
Central Park jogger, the 29-year-old woman is recovering and
sending messages to a group of fellow runners who are helping make
the park safer for everyone who uses its green expanse.
   Police have beefed up park security and volunteers are
patrolling the park, offering partners for runners and bringing
groups of them together for safer exercise.
   ``This is how good comes from bad,'' said Debbie King, director
of the New York Road Runners Safety Program.
   The jogger, an investment banker, was attacked by a mob of
teen-agers as she ran alone in the northern part of the park, late
in the evening of April 19.
   When police found the woman hours later, she was in a coma and
had lost three-quarters of her blood. Paramedics did not expect her
to live.
   She remained in critical condition until May 1, when she
appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name was called and raised
her hand.
   She was walking a bit when she was moved June 7 to Gaylord
Hospital in Wallingford, Conn.
   By midsummer, she reportedly was classified as a 7 on a recovery
scale of 1 to 8. Patients must reach level 8 to live independently.
She was able to read novels, relearn basic math skills and call
colleagues at Solomon Brothers, where she had worked before the
attack.
   Gaylord spokeswoman Lori Ann Brass said last week that the
jogger was ``making good progress, doing well.'' She would not
elaborate.
   Fred Lebow, president of the New York Road Runners, said he had
never met the injured jogger but received communications from her
through a mutual friend.
   ``I get little messages from her that she jogs a little bit at
Gaylord and that she hopes someday to run the marathon,'' said
Lebow.
   ``She's inspirational to anyone _ not just runners,'' said
Lebow. ``She came through a horrendous experience and evidently
she's recovering.''
   Six youths have been indicted in the attack; hearings are
scheduled for Tuesday although no trial date has been set.
   The case focused the energy of the city's legions of joggers who
were unwilling to surrender the huge park, which stretches 2{ miles
long and a half-mile wide through the center of Manhattan.
   In June, the Road Runners launched its safety program, in which
200 men and women take turns walking or running along a course in
the park in shifts from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. The joggers carry
lightweight radios and wear bright orange vests.
   ``They are the eyes and ears of the Central Park community,''
Ms. King said. ``The police can't be everywhere; citizens have to
take responsibility.''
   The volunteers have used the radios to report bicycle accidents,
stone-throwing incidents, a car accident and a sexual assault; last
month, a man who allegedly fondled two female joggers was arrested
15 minutes after they flagged down a Road Runner volunteer for help.
   ``There is a very positive feeling among people in Central Park
toward the people in the orange vests. ... It really boosts the
community morale in Central Park,'' Ms. King said.

   The Bush administration was preparing covert
action to seize Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
during a coup attempt last week but the uprising collapsed before
the plan could be executed, top officials said Sunday.
   President Bush made the decision near the end of a failed coup
last Tuesday, and the order was conveyed to the commander of U.S.
forces in Panama, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the White House national
security adviser.
   ``The message that was sent was that if there were an
opportunity to do this, without risking bloodshed and significant
loss of American life, and to do so without open military
involvement, then he was free to go ahead, the commander on the
ground was free to go ahead,'' Baker said on the NBC-TV program,
``Meet the Press.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that at the outset of the
coup, he told Thurman to be prepared to use peaceful means to take
custody of Noriega, but the chance never came.
   ``After the Panamanians had contacted us and told us ... that
they had Noriega but that they would not give him to us, I made it
clear that our commander on the scene was authorized to get him if
he could, without using military force, and that he should develop
an option or a plan to use military force to get him,' Cheney said
on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''
   ``We never made the decision to use military force, that would
have involved going in against the rebels and taking Noriega from
them. I never thought that was a very good idea, but we told to him
to be prepared in case he got the order to do so. Shortly after
that, the coup fell apart,'' said Cheney.
   The order to ready non-uniformed U.S. forces for a covert action
to grab Noriega was first reported in Sunday editions of the
Washington Post.
   Although that report did not attribute the decision to the
president, Scowcroft said, ``President Bush personally was
responsible what ever guidance was sent down, yes, personally
ordered whatever guidance was sent to General Thurman.''
   Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft said top presidential advisers
believe they acted correctly during the failed coup, despite
criticism from Congress that U.S. forces should have helped the
rebels or to intervened to seize Noriega for trial in the United
States on drug charges.
   ``There is nothing like 20-20 hindsight. Given what we know now
about what was actually happening on the ground, then, I think I
would not change what we did,'' Scowcroft said on the ABC-TV
program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Nearly a week after the incident, it was still not 100 percent
certain that the rebels who seized Noriega's headquarters ever had
custody of the strongman, Scowcroft said, and they told the deputy
U.S. commander in Panama. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, that they would
not hand him over.
   ``The rebels never asked us, indeed when we had that one meeting
with General Cisneros, we asked them to give him, and they said,
`No,''' said Scowcroft.
   ``At that point, we became fairly certain, although we did not
know for sure and still have no positive proof Noriega was there.
We had pretty good assurance that Noriega was in fact there,'' and
the decision was made to use non-uniformed U.S. forces to grab him,
said Scowcroft.
   The indication later Tuesday that Noriega was at his
headquarters about 600 yards from the U.S. command center ``changed
the calculus of what we were prepared to do,'' said Scowcroft.
   Noriega has told reporters that he was never in custody and
``the last thing he has said was that, no, he was never there,''
said Scowcroft.
   Throughout the coup, said Scowcroft, the administration was in
``the fog of war. ... You are operating without a full deck of
intelligence information.''
   Changes will be made to avoid a repeat, he said, but did not
spell out what steps were planned.
   ``We're not happy,'' Scowcroft said. ``We certainly hope Noriega
will not remain in power. ... He is a dangerous symbol.
   ``Our procedures, and in some cases some organizational things,
ought to be improved as a result of it, and we will be doing
that,'' he said.
   Although the rebels said they did not want open U.S. help, they
did ask American forces to block two of three overland routes to
the Noriega's headquarters.
   ``The plotters came in and said, `we do not want American help.
We do not want our action tainted by being involved with the United
States. All we want you to do is just sort of keep the
reinforcements from these two roads,''' Scowcroft said.
   U.S. forces deployed to block the two roads designated by the
plotters, but Bush decided that further use of uniformed American
troops to aid the rebels was too dangerous, Scowcroft said.
   ``The two roads that we blocked, the causeway and the bridge
over the canal, are ... bottlenecks. They are easy to isolate. They
are areas within our exercise area. ... Clearly, they are they are
things that can be done within our general treaty authorities,''
said Scowcroft, referring to the 1977 pact turing over the Panama
Canal to the Panamanians.
   ``The third route is very different. ... It is down through the
heart of old Panama City, multiple routes, crowded city, to do
that, and outside the area where U.S. troops move and exercise,
that have been the overt exercise of military force, perhaps into a
fire fight, to block them in the heart of a heavily populated
area,'' Scowcroft said.

<HEAD>Son Of `Mack the Knife' Singer Sues Over `Mac Tonight' Commercial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of the late singer Bobby
Darin is suing McDonald's Corp. for more than $10 million, alleging
the restaurant chain copied his father's singing style in the ``Mac
Tonight'' commercials.
   The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court
here, alleges that the television ads infringe on rights to Darin's
1959 hit version of the song ``Mack the Knife.''
   The commercials feature a tuxedoed man with a smiling
quarter-moon head, seated at a piano and belting out the hamburger
jingle.
   The suit alleges the character's voice and gestures resemble
those of Darin, who died in 1973 at age 37 of heart problems.
   The suit was filed on behalf of Dodd Darin _ the singer's son
and only heir _ and the Bobby Darin Testamentary Trust.
   Darin's upbeat version of ``Mack the Knife,'' a song from the
1928 German musical ``The Threepenny Opera,'' sold 2 million copies
and won Darin two 1960 Grammy awards.
   The suit seeks an injunction halting the McDonald's commercials,
$100,000 in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages.
   Also named as a defendant is the advertising agency of Davis,
Ball and Colombatto in Los Angeles.
   There was no immediate comment from the agency or McDonald's
Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill. Calls to both were not answered during the
weekend and there was no response to a message left on an answering
machine at McDonald's.
   In a similar case, a federal appeals court ruled that singer
Bette Midler had the right to sue the Ford Motor Co. over its
alleged use of ``sound-alike'' ad campaign of one of her
recordings. The appeals court resintated the suit, which a lower
court had thrown out. The suit has yet to come to trial.

<HEAD>Contract Rejected, NY City Opera Cancels Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York City Opera canceled the remaining
six weeks of its never-opened fall season Sunday after striking
orchestra members overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer, the
company's lawyer said.
   Members of Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater New
York voted 56-4 against the four-year proposal, the union announced
Sunday. They have been on strike since Sept. 13 _ what would have
been the season's opening night.
   In addition to the orchestra members, 300 to 400 performers and
backstage personnel are idled by the strike, said Martin
Oppenheimer, the opera's attorney and lead negotiator.
   ``The human loss is obviously significant and very
regrettable,'' Oppenheimer said. Equally important, he added, is
``the cultural loss to this community.''
   The contract voted down Saturday would have guaranteed the
musicians 29 weeks of work per year, the same number of weeks as
the previous contract, and raised wages and benefits 6{ percent
each year, Oppenheimer said. The opera initially sought to cut the
minimum work year to 23 weeks.
   Union spokeswoman Judy West said members believed the deal
didn't go far enough in improving wages and benefits.
   Under the old contract, orchestra members made $755 per 19\-hour
week.
   No new talks were scheduled but both sides said they probably
would meet soon, in hopes of saving the opera's spring season.
   The opera company was established in 1943.

<BYLINE>Replica of Henry Hudson's Ship To Sail on Shakedown Cruise</BYLINE>

   Nearly four centuries after explorer Henry
Hudson sailed up the river that bears his name, a replica of his
ship, the Half Moon, will journey down the Hudson River on its
maiden journey.
   The new Half Moon, with a crew of 20, will set out downriver on
its shakedown cruise this coming Saturday, making an overnight stop
in New York City, Andrew Hendricks, who conceived the project,
announced Saturday.
   The crew will then sail it down the Atlantic Coast on a two-week
cruise to the ship's new home at Washington, N.C., on the western
side of Pamlico Sound, Hendricks said. Plans for future voyages are
undecided, he said.
   The Half Moon was built to honor the Netherlands' contributions
to America and Hudson's 1609 voyage up the river, when the English
explorer was working for the Dutch East India Co.
   The 85-foot, 120-ton replica is a little different from Hudson's
``Halve Maen.'' This Half Moon features such non-authentic features
as an emergency engine and contemporary navigational equipment.
   ``You play a fine line with the historical thing,'' said
Hendricks, citing constraints such as Coast Guard regulations,
``but it's as historically accurate as it can be.''
   The ship originally was set to embark on a tour of several
Northeastern ports on July 5. But the June death of the ship's
architect and chief builder, Nicholas Benton, who fell from the
mast of another ship, forced a change of plans.
   ``We had blueprints ... but it didn't say what some of the sizes
of the parts were, or the colors,'' Hendricks said.
   Hendricks also had to hire people to do work that Benton would
have done for free, boosting the cost from $1 million to about $1.2
million, he said.
   Hendricks said he hopes to pay for the Half Moon by charging
admission at a planned visitor center in Washington, N.C.

   President Bush told a cheering audience of
Republican women Sunday that he has appointed more women to senior
positions in his first nine months than any president before did in
a full year.
   Bush interrupted a three-day holiday weekend at Camp David to
fly here by helicopter for a self-congratulatory address before
2,200 of the party faithful at the biennial convention of the
National Federation of Republican Women.
   Bush boasted that the Republican party ``understands the
heartbeat of the American people'' and is ``the only party that
delivers on its promises.''
   He made no reference to Panama and last Tuesday's abortive coup
there. Critics have accused Bush of failing to act decisively to
aid rebel officers seeking to overthrow strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Bush, his right hand bandaged from minor surgery three days ago,
instead crowed about successes on several fronts, from arms control
with the Soviets to curbing pollution and rebuilding America's
schools.
   He praised the 140,000-member federation for mounting a
candidate recruiting program called Project '90.
   ``Part of governing is making sure that in the Executive Branch
the best are chosen to serve. So we've sought out the best _ and
our record of appointing talented and qualified women to important
offices proves it,'' the president told the women at a luncheon in
the Baltimore Convention Center.
   ``We've appointed 139 women to senior positions in this
administration. ...'' said Bush. ``That's more women appointed in
our first nine months than any previous administration managed in
any given year.''
   ``I frankly believe that's a great step toward good
government,'' said Bush, who said the 139 included:
   _88 women nominated or announced for senior positions requiring
Senate confirmation;
   _21 to presidential appointments not requiring confirmation;
   _30 to deputy assistant secretary posts in Cabinet departments,
also not requiring confirmation.
   White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer said last month
that 20 percent of the posts requiring Senate confirmation have
gone to women. The old record for appointing women to posts
requiring Senate confirmation was 72, set by President Jimmy Carter
in 1980.
   The GOP women were winding up their 25th biennial convention.
   Bush, who also addressed their last convention in 1987, said,
``We promised America peace and prosperity and we're keeping that
promise.''
   He cited his recent call at the United Nations for a ban on all
chemical weapons, as well as his proposal to drastically reduce
conventional forces in Europe and what he called ``steady
movement'' toward long-range nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets.
   The economy has just entered ``the 83rd month of uninterrupted
economic growth,'' and nearly half a million black Americans have
found jobs in the past two years, Bush said.
   Bush said his administration has also made headway on the
environment, in staging the recent education summit and in the
struggle against drugs.
   The crowd gave some of its biggest cheers to First Lady Barbara
Bush, whom the presidential affectionately introduced as ``the
silver fox.''
   The couple flew immediately back to Camp David from Fort McHenry
after the 15-minute speech.
   The Bushes were spending the Columbus Day holiday at the
presidential retreat before returning to the White House Monday
afternoon.
   On Thursday Bush will be out on the hustings in Mississippi and
New York City, trying to help Republicans retain the congressional
seat of the late Rep. Larkin Smith, R-Miss., and wrest the
mayoralty of New York from the Democrats.

Philadelphia, was injured, Ms. Goldman said.
   Skies were partly cloudy, but there was no thunderstorm activity
reported in the area at the time. There was no apparent physical
damage to the plane but it was taken out of service for an

   The passengers were delayed in Ornaldo for about 2{ hours while
another plane was brought in.

   President Bush is waging a full-blown damage
control operation over the botched Panamanian uprising, struggling
against a torrent of criticism, confusion and shifting explanations
by the White House about the events and the U.S. response.
   The failed coup against Panamanian strongman Ge. Manuel Antonio
Noriega was regarded within the White House as the first crisis
test for Bush, and officials at the highest level were distressed
by mistakes in intelligence gathering, coordination and other
problems.
   ``We're not happy. Our procedures, and in some cases some
organizational things, ought to be improved as a result of it, and
we will be doing that,'' White House national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft said Sunday on the ABC-TV program ``This Week With
David Brinkley.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that ``given everything that
was available to us then, and given what I know now, I still think
we made the right decision.''
   Paraphrasing the president, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said that ``with 20-20 hindsight, I can't think of anything I
would do differently than what I did.''
   Bush was adamant in defending his decision not to intervene
militarily to unseat Noriega. ``I'm not just being stubborn but as
I look at all the information I wouldn't have made a different
decision then,'' he said last week.
   Aside from being a learning experience, the episode was a
dramatic reminder of the limits on U.S. influence in other
countries. It was a painful experience for Bush, who had encouraged
the Panama Defense Forces to rise up against their leader but then
decided to stay on the sidelines, refusing to authorize action by
any of the 12,000 U.S. military forces in Panama.
   Bush did not hide his frustration that Noriega was still in
power. ``Disappointed that Noriega's still there? Yes I am,'' he
said.
   Republicans joined Democrats in flaying the administration. In
one of the toughest criticisms, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
called the administration's handling of the coup as ``an incredible
stain on us'' and called White House statements a ``weak-kneed
explanation for failure.''
   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla., criticized the administration Sunday for not
planning in advance what aid it would give Panamanian military
officers who might attempt a coup.
   ``Every time there has been a witness before our committee, we
have asked again and again and again, if we start to take action,
are we prepared to see it through?'' Boren said on ABC.
   ``Since George Bush became president, every single word of
authority that he had requested from the intelligence committee and
every single penny that he has requested from the intelligence
committee relating to Panama, he has gotten and gotten with my
support,'' Boren said.
   Scowcroft immediately challenged Boren's contention, but
declined to give specifics, saying the details were secret.
   ``Senator Boren over the last year, his contribution to such
things, leaves me kind of astonished that he would say that,'' said
Scowcroft. ``We did not get everything we had wanted.''
   Much of the congressional criticism of the president's handling
of the crisis stemmed from the shifting administration version of
events.
   Did rebel forces ever offer to turn over Noriega to the United
States?
   Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft on Sunday all repeated
administration assertions that the rebels refused to hand over
Noriega, and even questioned whether they ever had him in custody.
   But late last week administration officials acknowledged that a
cable was sent to Washington saying that the rebels wanted to give
him up. The word `want' should have read `won't,' officials
insisted.
   Did the United States take part in the coup attempt?
   The White House at first insisted there was no involvement, then
acknowledged that U.S. troops were deployed along key access
routes, at the rebels' request, to block forces loyal to Noriega
from reaching his headquarters.
   ``They would have been stopped,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said, when asked if U.S. forces would have
intercepted Noriega reinforcements.
   Fitzwater also recanted his original claim that the United
States had not been in touch with coup leaders before the uprising.
In fact, he said U.S. officials had advance discussions with coup
leader Maj. Moises Giroldi.
   U.S. officials originally said the United States had been
reluctant to take direct action in the coup because of doubts about
Giroldi, who was known as a Noriega confidant and had helped put
down an earlier coup.
   On Sunday, Cheney repeated that he at first feared the coup was
``setup.''
   Giroldi was killed in the coup, perhaps by Noriega himself. In
retrospect, Fitzwater said, ``We think it (the coup) was legitimate
now.''
   Confusion is endemic to such situations, he said.
   ``It's because that's the nature of coups,'' he insisted.
``There is conflicting information. This whole thing happened in a
six-hour period and (there are) people running all over ... It's
the ambiguity of the coup itself, as is true of all coups, that
caused the conflict of information.''

   In 1953, Soviet tanks and troops
brutally put down an East German workers' uprising. But in 1989,
pro-democracy demonstrators in East Berlin chant ``Gorby, Gorby,
help us!''
   Many of the nation's 16.6 million people view reform-minded
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who visited East Berlin over
the weekend to mark the nation's 40th anniversary, as a sign of
hope for democratic change.
   But the communist leadership in East Berlin will hear nothing of
it, despite the growing exodus of East Germans who have fled to the
West in the past month seeking more freedom and economic
opportunity.
   The official East German news agency ADN called the weekend
protesters troublemakers who had been chanting ``slogans against
the republic'' _ referring at least in part to the cries of
``Gorby!''
   East German leader Erich Honecker Saturday dismissed the
protesters' demands and said their hopes were ``built on sand.''
   Gorbachev told the 77-year-old Honecker of a Russian saying that
``he who is late is punished'' and urged the East German leader to
consider reform.
   By the end of the day Saturday, more than 15,000 people had
taken to the streets in East Berlin and five other cities in the
biggest protests in 36 years.
   In 1953, it was the Red Army that crushed demonstrations and
killed at least 267 protesters. More than 100 others were later
executed for their role in the uprising.
   Angered by economic hardship and increased productivity quotas,
workers in East Berlin walked off the job on June 16, 1953. The
following day, more than 12,000 protesters took to the streets in
the city, and demonstrators also marched in Leipzig, Dresden and
other major cities.
   Soviet military commanders stationed in East Germany declared a
state of emergency and sent in troops to quell the protests with
tanks and guns. East Germany at the time was still under direct
Soviet domination, even though the state was formed in 1949.
   Communist authorities called the uprising ``a coup attempt
supported by Western agents.''
   Until recently, mass protests had been a rarity in East Germany.
   This weekend, the protesters were emboldened by a Soviet leader
_ rather than wary of possible Kremlin intervention.
   And although an estimated 380,000 Soviet troops remain stationed
on East German soil, this time it was East German police who put
down the demonstrations.
   Witnesses and media reports said police chased, kicked and
punched demonstrators. They also said hundreds of protesters were
arrested and injured.
   While Gorbachev's visit was friendly and cordial, there were
other signs of change between the two countries.
   When Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev visited East Berlin for the
30th anniversary celebrations in 1979, his picture was on the front
page of the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland.
   Ten years later, there was no Gorbachev picture, and there was
no customary live television coverage of his arrival.

<HEAD>Moslem Leader Says Talks Deadlocked Over Syrian Withdrawal, Christian
Reform</HEAD>

   A leading Lebanese Moslem legislator
said Sunday that talks on ending his country's civil war were
deadlocked and that a ``more vicious war'' could break out unless
Christians surrender some political power.
   Zaher Khatib, a Sunni Moslem who represents the National Front,
an alliance of 18 Syrian and Iranian-backed Lebanese factions, told
reporters that Syria will not withdraw its troops from Lebanon
until the Christians agree to political reforms.
   ``We're at a dangerous crossroads,'' he said after 63 Lebanese
lawmakers failed to meet for the third straight day because of deep
divisions on the central issue of Syria's military presence in
Lebanon and reforms proposed by the Arab League.
   The 33 Christian and 30 Moslem legislators have been in the
Saudi Arabian resort of Taif since Sept. 30 to discuss proposals to
end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. The 22-member Arab League is
sponsoring the meeting.
   Khatib said the meeting was a ``historic and golden
opportunity'' that should not be lost.
   ``The alternative is a renewal of the war, and this time it will
be a more vicious war because the weapons are going to be more
vicious,'' he said.
   The Arab League has proposed that Syrian troops withdraw over
two years from Moslem sectors of Beirut to the Bekaa Valley in the
east. A new Lebanese government then would negotiate future Syrian
military deployments.
   Lebanese Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite Catholic,
has demanded a complete Syrian pullout within six months.
   The Syrians, who consider Lebanon vital to their security
against Israel, have made it clear they will not withdraw before
the Christians agree to share power equally with Moslems.
   They have also linked withdrawal of their 40,000 troops in
Lebanon to an Israeli withdrawal from a border strip in southern
Lebanon. The Israelis have refused to budge despite U.N. pressure.
   Youssef Hammoud, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem Parliament member,
said consultations in Taif were deadlocked for the past three days
by what he called a ``tug of war'' between Moslems and Christians.
   The Christians, dominated by the Maronites, have held most key
posts in Lebanon's government, Parliament, judiciary and army since
independence from France in 1943.
   They were considered the majority then. But Moslems now make up
an estimated 55 percent of the Mediterranean country's 4 million
population.
   The Syrians moved in under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate
in 1976, the year after the civil war broke out. Aoun claims they
abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the Moslems.
   The Syrians insist they have never been asked to leave. But the
Christians claim the Syrians ignored two formal requests by former
presidents Elias Sarkis and Amin Gemayel.
   Aoun, although outgunned and outnumbered, launched a ``war of
liberation'' against the Syrians in March. That touched off six
months of fierce artillery battles that killed more than 900 people
before an Arab League-brokered cease-fire took hold Sept. 22.
   Lebanon's political problems are further complicated by the two
rival governments that have ruled since September 1988; one is led
by Aoun and the other by acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has been in contact with Aoun and Hoss
in an effort to break the deadlock.
   Aoun has made no public comment. But Hoss was quoted by Kuwait's
Al-Seyassah daily Sunday as saying that his side considers the
cease-fire as a ``permanent peace'' rather than just a truce.
   Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid
of Algeria form the Arab League mediation committee that is trying
to end Lebanon's civil war, which has killed more than 150,000
people.
   A statement from the U.S. State Department circulated to
reporters in Taif Sunday backed the lawmakers' meeting and praised
their ``courageous efforts.''

   The Botswana Democratic Party, which
has governed this diamond-rich nation since independence in 1966,
retained a comfortable majority in Parliament, according to partial
returns Sunday.
   The party captured all 19 districts where final results were
available for the elections, and it appeared set to add to its
majority in Parliament. Prior to Saturday's balloting, the party
held 28 of the 34 seats.
   The left-leaning Botswana National Front was expected to retain
at least four of its five seats. The Botswana People's Party lost
its lone seat.
   This peaceful, southern African nation is one of only a few on
the continent to hold regular, multiparty elections. Saturday's
polls were the sixth since Botswana gained independence from
Britain 23 years ago.
   President Quett Masire and his Democratic Party retained their
comfortable majority on the strength of Botswana's surging
capitalist economy, which has grown at least 10 percent annually
throughout the 1980s.
   Diamonds from the Kalahari Desert, along with cattle ranching,
account for most of the wealth in this thinly populated desert
nation of 1.2 million.
   When Botswana gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations, with a per capita annual income of less than $100.
Today the average yearly income is more than $1,000, one of the
highest in Africa.
   At a time when many African nations are crippled by huge foreign
debts, Botswana's government has spent cautiously and has foreign
reserves in excess of $2 billion, enough to pay for more than two
years of imports.
   Masire, president since 1980, has avoided expensive public works
projects and concentrated on small-scale development.
   The opposition National Front argued that Botswana's wealth has
not reached the ordinary workers and called for an increase in
public spending and the creation of more social programs.

   A military jet apparently malfunctioned
shortly after takeoff from an aircraft carrier, and three crewmen
were killed when they ejected before it crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean, a Navy spokesman said Sunday.
   A fourth crewman was rescued by helicopter minutes later, said
Lt. Cmdr. Michael John, spokesman for the Norfolk-based Naval Air
Force, Atlantic Fleet.
   The crewmen ejected from the S-3 Viking jet Saturday afternoon,
shortly after it took off from the carrier USS John F. Kennedy,
which was on training exercises about 125 miles southeast of
Norfolk.
   The crash occurred within sight of the Kennedy, and the
surviving crewman was rescued and two bodies were recovered shortly
afterward, John said.
   Investigators were searching Sunday for the wreckage of the
antisubmarine warfare jet, which was based at Cecil Field Naval Air
Station in Jacksonville, Fla. John said it was not immediately
known why the crew ejected.
   Killed were the Viking pilot, Lt. Douglas G. Gray, 29, of
Jacksonville, and crew members Lt. John T. Hartman, 31, of nearby
Middleburg, and Lt. j.g. David S. Jennings, 28, of Akron, Ohio.
Hartman's body had not been recovered.
   The survivor was Petty Officer 2nd Class Tracy S. Mann, whose
age and hometown were not immediately available, John said. He was
treated aboard the aircraft carrier for bumps and bruises and was
expected to return to duty.
   Late Friday night, two crewmen escaped serious injury when their
F-14 Tomcat fighter jet hit a fire wall on the deck of the same
aircraft carrier. The crewmen ejected before the flaming aircraft
plunged into the sea and sank.
   The two were also rescued by helicopter and were in good
condition aboard the Kennedy, the Navy said.
   John said the fire wall deflects jet blasts when planes are
taking off.
   Both crashes are under investigation, he said.

   Azerbaijani railroad crews defied a national ban
on transport strikes Sunday and again stemmed the flow of
desperately needed supplies to rival Armenia.
   Reports conflicted, however, on how much food, fuel and building
supplies were reaching the Armenian republic.
   ``Our drivers are striking and demanding guarantees of their
safety'' in response to gunfire and stoning attacks on several
trains Saturday night in Armenia, said Azerbaijani activist Shahin
Gadzhiev.
   Gadzhiev identified himself as a spokesman for the Azerbaijani
People's Front. Other members of the People's Front denied that
train traffic had been halted.
   ``The trains are running, but the attacks on them are also
continuing,'' Adel Mamedov said in a telephone interview from the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported late Sunday that
37 trains had been dispatched from Azerbaijan to Armenia over the
past day and a half, but it said ``extremist forces are still
hindering the normal functioning of the route.''
   About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reported
idled on main lines in the southwestern region of the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on strikes in
such key sectors as transport and energy Tuesday after President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned that stoppages could ruin the economy
and lead to anarchy.
   It also ordered the ministries of defense and interior to
restore rail traffic between the two feuding Caucasus republics.
Troops moved in to protect the trains, and Soviet media said Friday
the two-month blockade that crippled Armenia was over.
   But the measures failed to quell the prolonged ethnic feuding
over Nagorno-Karabakh, the fertile region claimed by both Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
   The Christian Armenian enclave has been part of Moslem-dominated
Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Nineteen months of unrest over Nagorno-Karabakh has left 117
dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes and apartments
destroyed, Tass said.
   In the disputed region, five people were wounded in clashes
Saturday and an epidemic of viral hepatitis threatened the
population, Tass reported Sunday.
   ``Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with
dark malice and suppresses their reason,'' the official news agency
said, noting that reports from the region increasingly resemble
dispatches from war zones.
   Airlifts ``are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' in
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has a predominantly Armenian population of
about 160,000, Tass said.
   It said a highway bridge on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh's
capital, Stepanakert, was blown up early Saturday, cutting off
additional areas.
   Ungathered grape crops are rotting in the field, armed attacks
against villages continue and ambulances cannot respond to calls
because they have no gas, Tass said.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said Sunday that Armenia was
still hit by food and fuel shortages, although they were not as
severe as in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   He said the few shipments that made it through Azerbaijan to
Armenia were sabotaged. They either contained damaged materials or
cisterns filled with water instead of fuel.
   ``Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in a telephone
interview from the Armenian capital of Yerevan. ``That the blockade
was stopped at all is a myth.''
   Interior Ministry officials and reporters for state-run media in
Armenia and Azerbaijan were unavailable Sunday for comment on the
blockade.
   About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs through
Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted
reconstruction work on Armenian areas destroyed by the massive
earthquake last December that left 25,000 dead.
   Gadzhiev, whose People's Front is demanding Azerbaijani control
of Nagorno-Karabakh, accused Armenians of attempting to impose
their own blockades on Azerbaijan.
   He said Saturday's bridge explosion in Nagorno-Karabakh was
aimed at the Azerbaijani village nearby. The power supply to part
of Azerbaijan also has been interrupted by Nagorno-Karabakh's
unrest, Gadzhiev said from Baku.

   Barry Andrew Keasley, stage manager of the
Broadway play ``M. Butterfly,'' died of a heart attack a short time
after collapsing backstage during a performance. He was 42.
   Keasley died Saturday night at St. Clare's Hospital, said John
Springer, a public relations spokesman for the play.
   Keasley had undergone open heart surgery within the last years,
Springer said. He died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital
after he collapsed Saturday night, Springer said.
   Besides ``M. Butterfly,'' Keasley served as stage manager on
Broadway for such productions as ``Equus,'' ``Seesaw,'' ``Hair''
and ``42nd Street.''
   Keasley is survived by his wife, Janet Friedman, his mother and
two brothers.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Sunday, but Springer said
services will be held in Keasley's native Rhode Island, with a
memorial service in New York.

<HEAD>Armani Brings Back the Hippies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring 1990 will mark the rebirth of flower
power, at least in the fashion world.
   Giorgio Armani, who opened the Italian spring-summer
ready-to-wear shows Sunday with his Emporio line, called on the
young to recall the hippie dress code of their parents _ gypsy
skirts and shawls, vests, tattered jeans, oversized shirts and
jackets, clumpy sandals.
   For beach boys and girls, Armani drew inspiration from the South
Pacific with fishnet and burlap his-and-her sarongs and diaper
shorts.
   Italian beaches have long bade farewell to the bikini of the
1960s, giving way to whole suits for women and surf shorts for men.
   Armani takes the look a step further by delving into grandma's
trunk for those Great Gatsby striped tank suits.
   A gasp went up among Americans attending the early morning show
in the theater of Armani's downtown palazzo at the parade of
bare-breasted woman surrounded by bare-chested men, all wearing
Armani's jeans. Europeans, accustomed to topless bathing, didn't
bat an eyelash.
   The blazer king likes his jackets long and light, with a curved
front like a tulip petal, reminiscent of designs several seasons
ago by Italy's Romeo Gigli.
   There was a touch of Gigli too in the faded pastel shades of the
collection and the rounded uneven hemlines of skirts and dresses.
For summer Armani hikes his hemlines way above his demure winter
length.
   Lightweight pantsuits with ample jackets and baggy trousers and
a series of cool cotton jumpsuits are sure to attract summer city
dwellers.
   Another fashion favorite of the younger set, Franco Moschino,
also showed Sunday morning.
   What attracts the young in Moschino is his irony toward fashion
and the fashion world at large. During his shows he likes to hide
his own beautiful clothes under exaggerations of other designers'
embellishments.
   Thus he once based an entire show on headgear from stovepipes to
teddy bears, mocking Christian Lacroix. At every show he makes a
point of ladening his evening wear with heavy gold chains, a Chanel
trademark.
   Moschino also likes to poke fun at people who live by labels,
often sewing his own label on the outside of an outfit. Last season
he designed a jacket with the words ``very expensive jacket''
stitched on the back in gold letters.
   For spring-summer 1990, Moschino also flirt with the new hippie
trend in a series of multicolored gypsy skirts, jeans outfits and
Mexican-style long vests, but the bulk of his collection was based
on an evening look of basic black and gold.
   His most astonishing outfit was a three-piece suit _ jacket,
brassiere and short skirt _ in glimmery gold fabric, with lavish
gold jewelry and a gold chain belt.
   His most ironic style was a floor-length black chiffon gown with
the letters VIP in gold down the front, with the V incorporated in
the neckline.
   Over the next five days, forty of Italy's top ready-to-wear
designers, including Armani, Versace, Krizia, Biagiotti, Missoni,
Fendi and Ferre will present their styles for next year's warmer
weather.
   Along with beautiful clothes the fashion crowd will be treated
to a night at the famed La Scala Opera house for a performance by
Moscow's Bolshoi theater.

<TEXT>
   A hummingbird that mysteriously ended
up thousands of miles north of its normal range will be making the
trip south by airplane, but its fate is still uncertain.
   The 3-inch Costa's, believed to be a year old, spent the summer
and early fall feeding on fuchsias at a home on the edge of
Anchorage.
   Other types of hummingbirds make their way to Alaska, but the
Costa's breeds in the southwestern United States and usually heads
to Mexico this time of year. The bird normally travels only as far
north as Sacramento, Calif.
   ``He's so cute. He's like a member of the family,'' said Pat
Bergt, whose bushes became the bird's adopted home.
   No one is sure how the hummingbird, with plumage of green and
violet, got to Alaska.
   Denise Gillen, a San Diego Zoo hummingbird specialist, said the
bird most likely was ushered north by a weather system. Other
possibilities are ``some kind of strange thing going on in his
body,'' and there's even a remote chance the bird, which
periodically goes into a dormant state, was on a household plant
that got packed for a journey to Alaska, she said.
   Mrs. Bergt and her husband, Derril, grew concerned about the
advance of winter and its possible toll on the hummingbird after it
lingered week after week about 20 feet behind their home, so they
called in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Bruce Batten, information officer at the agency's office in
Anchorage, already had plans Tuesday to head through Seattle to
Washington, D.C., for a seminar and decided to take the bird along
in a shoebox-size container.
   He said he will release the Costa's in Seattle if a relay flight
and escort to a point farther south cannot be lined up.
   Gillen said she doesn't know how the bird will fare in Seattle
or whether it will fly south from there on its own.
   Mrs. Bergt said she also was worried.
   ``He could get hurt. He could not survive the shipping,'' Mrs.
Bergt said. ``But he has a better chance than he will have here.''

<TEXT>
   Temperatures dropped into the 20s early Sunday over the
north-central part of the nation, breaking records at several
cities, while rain was scattered from the Southwest into the
Southeast.
   In contrast to the morning chill far to the north, Miami tied
its record of 92 degrees during the afternoon.
   Temperatures hit the 20s over the northern half of the Plains,
the upper Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes.
   Record lows included 24 at Duluth, Minn.; 22 at International
Falls, Minn.; 22 at Marquette, Mich.; and 27 at Minneapolis-St.
Paul, Minn. Grand Rapids, Mich., tied its record of 28, which has
stood since 1896.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 at Gunnison, Colo.
   The cold air was forecast to extend over the Ohio Valley by
Monday morning, and frost warnings were posted over north-central
and eastern Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
   Afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended over the southern
Florida Peninsula, from northern Florida into southern Georgia,
over the central Gulf of Mexico coast, and from southwestern New
Mexico into southwestern Texas.
   But during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, there were no reports
of even a half-inch of rain.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over western Pennsylvania and
northeastern North Carolina.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 97 at Palm Springs and Thermal,
Calif.

   For three hours, AP-Dow Jones reporter Igor
Reichlin hid in the apartment of an East German family that risked
prison sentences by refusing to open the door to police searching
for demonstrators. Here is his account of the demonstrations in
East Berlin.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By IGOR REICHLIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two fellow correspondents and I were following a
column of several hundred pro-democracy marchers down a narrow
street in East Berlin early Sunday when riot police surrounded the
protesters.
   Just as we realized we had been cut off, the police charged us,
separating the column into small groups. One of the groups ran into
a doorway and then into a courtyard where more police jumped out to
grab them.
   One of the marchers was able to duck into an open doorway. NBC
Radio correspondent Gary Matsumoto and I followed him in. We ran
upstairs where we were hidden by a family that had seen us fleeing.
   The family concealed us for three hours at great personal risk.
Police knocked on their door many times, threatening to break it
down if they didn't open it. They refused.
   Our other colleague _ (London) Sunday Times correspondent Peter
Millar of England _ was arrested and taken to a police station in a
suburb.
   We later found out that he was questioned for six hours and
released. He told us that up to 1,000 people may have been arrested
Saturday night and early Sunday in East Berlin and that many were
beaten while being detained.
   A fourth Western journalist _ London Sunday Observer
correspondent Catherine Field _ got away somehow.
   The demonstration started with about 7,000 people Saturday
afternoon and continued with interruptions until around 1 a.m.
Sunday. By then the police had brought in water cannon and used
them on the few hundred people still left on the streets.
   The family that sheltered us consisted of a man in his 40s, a
woman in her 30s and their child about age 10. The couple asked
that their names not be published because of possible harassment by
security forces.
   As we talked we heard screams outside of protesting crowds when
the water cannon went into action, and police boots stomping on the
cobblestone streets as police scattered marchers.
   Our host, who clearly was risking his job by hiding us, was
deeply sad.
   ``It's a horrible shame that Germans are beating up on other
Germans out of fear of change,'' he said. ``We need to discuss our
problems, but what kind of discussion can you have when rubber
truncheons are the strongest argument our government can offer?''
   Both parents said they were white-collar workers and are
intensely interested in current affairs. Their large apartment was
filled with books on various topics.
   Tens of thousands of despairing East Germans have left their
homeland for the West in the past two months, and there is a
growing pro-democracy movement that is unwanted by the country's
hard-line leaders.
   The East Berlin couple was concerned about where their country
was headed, and that violence might soon erupt again.
   The family offered us food, but we were too nervous to eat. We
did accept their offer of some red wine and later, tea.
   The husband went over to a window, inspecting the backyard to
see if there were any police there. There were none. But police
were still milling around in front of the house.
   He said we would probably be able to get out safely if we left
through a backdoor and walked through the backyard to a side
street. We decided to try it and thanked our hosts for their help.
   I met up again with Millar on Sunday morning at the Grand Hotel,
who said he was ordered to leave East Berlin. He said he wasn't
beaten while detained but he was handled roughly until the police
found out he was foreign correspondent.
   Millar was first taken to the prison at Ruemmelsburg. Because
the prison was already full he was then taken to a large detention
facility at Marzahn.
   I escaped the beatings and arrests and have little to show as
battle scars except a wrist sprained in a successful tussle with a
state security agent for my tape recorder.

<TEXT>
   About 200 faithful followers and a few
curious tourists attended services at Jim and Tammy Bakker's
shopping center church-studio Sunday, but the convicted evangelist
and his wife were absent.
   ``Reverend and Mrs. Bakker are resting today from the rigorous
ordeal of the trial,'' said the Rev. Gene Kennett, a Pennsylvania
evangelist who has been filling in for the television evangelists.
   Bakker, convicted last week of bilking his PTL ministry
followers of $3.7 million, returned with his wife to his rented
Orlando home Saturday. Windows at the house were soaped over to
ensure no one could see inside.
   Bakker, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 24, faces up to 120 years
in prison and $5 million in fines on 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy. He was accused of raising $158 million by overselling
time-shares or lodging guarantees, called ``lifetime
partnerships,'' at PTL's Heritage USA retreat near Charlotte, N.C..
   Reporters were kept outside Sunday's service while worshipers
were welcomed with handshakes and handed addressed envelopes to
send donations to Jim and Tammy Ministries Inc.
   Some who emerged from the nearly two-hour service said it was
filled with pleas for money, but others said the call was more for
hope than handouts.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed. I will still give
money to Jim anytime he needs it,'' said Myrna Coppersmith, a
13-year PTL partner who followed Bakker when he moved his ministry
here earlier this year.
   ``I feel Jim has been betrayed,'' she said. ``When all the facts
come out, Jim will be a free man.''
   But another follower, a Lakeland woman who said she had been a
PTL member for 12 years but refused to give her name, disagreed.
   ``You have to be realistic and accept the jury's verdict,'' she
said. ``It's like a death in the family and I was hoping this would
be the funeral.''
   Ushers had to put extra seats in the back of the tiny
combination church and television studio to accomodate the tourists.
   ``It's just a big show,'' said Irma de la Cruz of San Juan,
Puerto Rico, who said she came out of curiousity. ``This confirms
what I've always felt _ there's not much religion in this
ministry.''
   Bakker's attorney has said the Orlando ministry will be
suspended indefinitely but Kennett said it will continue ``with the
help of the partners.''

   The second minor earthquake to hit
the southern California desert in three days shook the remote San
Jacinto mountain range Sunday, but no damage or injuries were
reported.
   The mid-morning quake measured 3.0 on the Richter scale of
ground motion and was centered in a remote mountain area 23 miles
south of Palm Springs, said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``We didn't feel it,'' said Diane Kazmar, a Palm Springs police
services assistant.
   On Friday, an earthquake measuring 2.7 shook mountains 10 miles
north of Palm Springs. No damage or injuries were reported.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
An earthquake measuring 3.5 can cause slight damage in the
immediate area.

<TEXT>
   There's evidence an automatic fire alarm
system may not have worked when a blaze broke out last week at a
nursing home, killing nine, authorities said.
   A preliminary investigation of the fire indicates the system _
which also is supposed to automatically close the building's fire
doors _ never sent an alarm out of Hillhaven Rehabilitation and
Convalescent Center, city Fire Marshal Carl Welch said. The fire
department instead heard about the blaze via telephone calls.
   ``There seems to be some confusion on whether the fire alarms
worked correctly,'' said Jeffrey McKain, vice president of the home.
   Nine of the home's 160 residents were killed and 98 injured
Thursday when a 78-year-old patient accidentally tossed a match on
his bed while smoking cigarettes in his second-floor room, in
violation of the home's rules. The man was among those who died.
   ``It looks like the main alarm had not been tripped,'' Welch
said. He said Sunday that investigators were trying to determine if
fire officials or anyone else reset the alarm after the blaze.
   The possible alarm malfunction also may have prevented fire
doors in the nursing home from closing, Welch said. Fire doors are
ordinarily kept open with electric magnets until tripped by fire
alarms, McKain said.
   Welch said Sunday that investigators were still determining
whether the fire doors did indeed fail to close. The fire was
confined largely to one room, but thick smoke surged through other
parts of the building, and most of the deaths were due to smoke
inhalation.
   The automatic alarm system is linked to MGI Security Services
Inc., which is supposed to relay calls to the city fire department.
   Welch said MGI officials had not indicated whether the alarm
reached the company. Investigators planned to look at the company's
records Monday, he said.
   A woman who answered the telephone Sunday at MGI and refused to
give her name said only one employee was authorized to answer
questions about the fire, and he would not be available for comment
until Monday.
   Two of the injured nursing home patients remained in critical
condition Sunday at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, nursing
supervisor Mary Dadell said. A third was in serious condition and
seven others were in satisfactory condition, she said.
   Firefighters were called to the nursing home by four telephone
calls from employees to the emergency 911 line, Welch said. But he
stressed that firefighters were able to respond quickly.
   ``The fire still was confined to one room,'' Welch said Sunday.
``In a facility like that, if we can do that, we did good.''
   The brick nursing home was not required to have fire sprinklers
because it was built 20 years ago, but McKain said fire sprinklers
will be added within six months. The nursing home had passed two
state inspections this year and held fire drills each month.
   McKain said Hillhaven held monthly fire drills as required by
regulations, and a staff training session on evacuation techniques
was held about two hours before the fire.
   Patients who were not injured in the fire were taken to other
nursing homes.

   Claudio Abbado, musical director of the Vienna
State Opera, was chosen Sunday to succeed the late Herbert von
Karajan as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra.
   Abbado, 56, was selected in a secret ballot by the Berlin
Philharmonic orchestra's 120 musicians and accepted the post in a
telephone conversation, Anke Martiny, West Berlin's chief cultural
official, told reporters.
   Abbado, who will be only the fifth chief conductor in the
107-year-old state-subsidized Berlin Philharmonic, was not
considered among the favorites for the post.
   Other musical luminaries, such as Lorin Maazel, James Levine,
Daniel Barenboim and Riccardo Muti, were initially thought to have
better chances in the musicians' first direct balloting for a new
leader.
   Karajan, who headed the Berlin Philharmonic for 35 years, died
July 16 at age 81. The brilliant and revered maestro stirred
millions of people with his music and was perhaps the world's most
honored and prolific conductor.
   Austrian-born Karajan resigned his ``conductor for life'' post
in April after contract differences with the orchestra.
   Abbado, a native of Milan, Italy, is considered among the
world's top conductors and has made guest appearances with the
Berlin Philharmonic since 1966.
   No date was immediately set for him to take up his new position,
since he is still bound by contract to the Vienna opera. Martiny
said negotiations ``will not be easy.'' But she added: ``A great
musical future is opening up for Berlin.''
   Abbado, a member of an artistically inclined family, began
studying piano, composition and conducting at Milan's conservatory
at age 16.
   He also took cello and organ courses, and his teachers included
Viennese conductor Hans Swarovsky.
   Abbado quickly rose to prominence in the 1960s, won prizes and
led several European and American orchestras. Then he returned
home, where he became chief conductor at Milan's La Scala opera in
1968 and later musical director.
   He has been the Chicago Philharmonic's chief guest conductor
since 1982, and he has long worked with the Vienna Philharmonic and
London Symphony Orchestra.
   He has been musical director at the Vienna State Opera since
1986.
   Abbado is known for his recordings of modern composers like
Gustav Mahler and Bela Bartok, as well as innovative productions of
operas like Giuseppe Verdi's ``Don Carlos.''
   In public statements, he rebelled against what he considered
bourgeois hesitation to accept modern classical music though he was
avowedly apolitical. He staged free concerts for Italian workers,
saying he wanted to reach out to new audiences.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega moved
Sunday to gain the backing of the Panamanian people following an
attempted coup, thanking them for ``support that reinforced'' his
leadership.
   A small group of officers and troopers of Panama's Defense
Forces tried to oust Noriega Tuesday but the revolt was crushed by
loyalists.
   Sunday's editions of the government-owned La Republica newspaper
were filled with articles praising Noreiga and pictures of the
general, commander of the Defense Forces. One headline read, ``A
general with nerves of steel.''
   A message from Noriega was broadcast on nationwide television
and radio at the end of an editorial on a military news program.
   In his message Noriega thanked Panamanians for ``the
demonstrations of moral and spiritual support that reinforced the
position of MAN (Manuel Antonio Noriega) and of his men in the
critical moment when the fate of Panama and its national liberation
movement were at stake.''
   ``Those who think that the cause will fail if one man falls are
mistaken,'' he said.
   Noriega has accused the United States of backing the failed coup.
   Washington has applied political and economic pressure in an
effort to oust Noriega since February 1988 when he was indicted in
Florida on drug- trafficking charges. Noriega says the indictments
are part of a U.S. plot to renege on the treaties to turn the
Panama Canal over to Panama at the end of the century.
   The news program's editorial declared, ``We have a general for
tough times commanding our troops.''
   It said more ``surprise attacks'' could be in store and added,
``We won't be caught with our guard down.''
   More than 60 soldiers and political figures, including three
members of Noriega's general staff, have been arrested in the
crackdown since the attempted coup.

   Hard-line opponents of reform said
Sunday that the national Communist Party, dissolved by delegates to
a party congress, still exists and its fate must be decided by its
entire membership.
   Congress delegates on Saturday voted to dissolve the party,
saying ``its history ... has ended.'' The Communist Party,
officialy called the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, is to be
replaced by the Hungarian Socialist Party, according to the congres
resolution. Reform leaders said the new party would be similar to
Western European socialist parties.
   It was the first time in the Soviet bloc that the leadership of
a Communist Party has decided to dissolve the organization. The
move represents an attempt to draw support for multiparty national
elections scheduled for June at the latest.
   But a ranking Communist conservative defied his party's
decision. Former Politburo member Janos Berecz said Sunday the old
party remains in existence until its entire rank-and-file decides
on its fate.
   Berecz, ousted from the party Politburo by reformers several
months ago, said, ``The membership still has to decide, and if the
majority or a large section of the membership decides that they are
members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, then I am with
them.''
   He spoke in an interview on state television and did not
elaborate.
   Another conservative, Robert Ribanszki, said he would organize a
plebiscite among the 720,000 members of the old party to allow them
to declare their party affiliation.
   ``The decision made yesterday was a great step backward in the
history of the Hungarian left-wing movement,'' said Ribanszki.
``It's not the Leninist principles that were wrong but the way they
were implemented.''
   The hard-line Janos Kadar Society, named for Hungary's former
leader, announced plans to found a new Communist Party. Politburo
member Janos Barabas suggested the courts may have to decide.
   Janos Barabas, a reform member of the Politburo, was asked if
the new Socialist Party could be considered the legal successor to
the Communist Party and he said the courts may have to decide.
   Some legal experts at the congress told reporters the new party
was the legal successor because it was a child of the congress _
the old party's most authoritative body.
   The new party has invited into its ranks all members of the old
party who agree with its principles. The new party's platform backs
parliamentary democracy with competing parties and components of
private ownership in the national economy.
   Vice Premier Peter Medgyessy urged the successors of the
dissolved Communist Party to stop interfering in government
business as Hungary prepares for its first free elections in 41
years.
   Medgyessy told reporters he would like to see a ``government of
experts'' run the country until the elections.
   He also indicated he believed to many conservatives may be
allowed into the new party, saying, ``I am not convinced that the
so-called cleansing (of ranks) that is necessary actually has
happened.''

<HEAD>Investigators Seize Company Records in Mine Explosion Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATCROFT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal investigators seized a
mine company's log books, memorandums and computer printouts in
their probe of a coal mine explosion that killed 10 miners last
month.
   Agents of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service and Kentucky State
Police acted Friday and Saturday on search warrants issued by a
judge for Pyro Mining Co.
   Harvey Fenster, a spokesman for Pyro Mining, said the company
already had turned over most _ but not all _ records sought by
investigators. He said the company would have turned over the
remainer if investigators had gone through proper channels.
   Michael Finnie, a special investigator for the Mine Safety and
Health Administration, said in a sworn statement submitted to a
court Friday that workers removed a cinder-block barrier inside the
western Kentucky mine about 15 minutes before the Sept. 13
explosion.
   That action disrupted air currents, creating dangerous levels of
explosive methane, Finnie said.
   Pyro Mining said Saturday in a statement that the company did
not violate federal mine-safety laws by making a ventilation change
in the mine the day of the explosion. The company did not elaborate.
   Last month Ron Siler, president of Costain Coal Inc., parent to
Pyro Mining, said a barrier was indeed taken down the morning of
the explosion, but after the fatal blast, not 15 minutes before.
And he contended that its removal could not have been a factor,
even if it came before the accident.
   The company also denied Finnie's allegation that employees
apparently tore pages out of mine record books before giving the
books to federal officials the day of the explosion.
   Investigators have said the explosion occurred after a spark _
possibly from a welder's torch or electrical equipment _ ignited a
dangerously high concentration of methane.

<HEAD>Menem Draws Praise And Criticism For Military Amnesty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem assessed
the political damage Sunday of his pardons for military officers
accused of human rights violations and found both support and angry
criticism.
   ``President Menem had the courage to untie one of the most
dramatic Gordian knots of Argentine life,'' Clarin, the country's
largest newspaper, commented in an editorial.
   ``This is not to say the presidential measure will be a balm
that miraculously cures all wounds,'' it said, but ``he worked
inspired by the common good.''
   Other expressions of support came from members of the
conservative Union of the Democratic Center, Argentina's third
biggest political party; a Roman Catholic bishop, military figures
and Menem's own Peronist Party.
   But human rights groups and leftist politicians and newspapers
denounced Menem for pardoning 39 officers accused of kidnapping,
torture and murder in the ``dirty war'' against suspected
subversives during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
   Thousands of Communist Party pamphlets were distributed saying,
``The killers and coup makers of today will be the repressors of
tomorrow.''
   At least 8,960 suspected leftists were arrested, never seen
again and presumed executed, according to a commission appointed by
former President Raul Alfonsin whose election in 1983 ended
military rule. Human rights groups put the total number of victims
who disappeared at 30,000 or more.
   Congressman Federico Storani of Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union,
second in size behind the Peronists, accused Menem of appeasing the
armed forces ``in case their intervention is necessary'' to quell
protests against his economic policies.
   Menem, a 59-year-old former provincial governor, was held under
arrest for nearly five years following the March 1976 military coup
that ousted President Isabel Peron. He was elected president last
May and took office on July 8 amid triple-digit inflation and
rising unemployment.
   Opponents of the pardons said Menem's action was too much in
favor of the military.
   ``It is legitimite to desire that society be reconciled with
itself. But this is not the way,'' Eduardo Luis Duhalde, director
of the leftist newspaper ``Nuevo Sur,'' wrote in a column.
   ``Carlos Saul Menem has committed a grave error ... that in the
end may devour him,'' Duhalde wrote. Reconciliation ``can never be
based on forgetfulness ... putting on the same level victims and
aggressors, killers and killed, martyrs and hangmen.''
   Also pardoned were 174 officers accused of participating in
three rebellions against Alfonsin and three officers _ including
ex-army commander and president Leopoldo Galtieri _ who were jailed
for mishandling the 1982 Falklands War with Britain.

<TEXT>
   While House leaders don't like to publicly use
the words ``pay raise,'' they are quietly shaping a scenario under
which Congress can vote to increase its pay with bipartisan accord
and the blessing of President Bush.
   Still smarting from the political fiasco last February under
which Congress was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percent
raise, House leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for the
next attempt to raise lawmakers' salaries.
   Foremost among them were that there will be a recorded vote and
that the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out of
speaking fees members of Congress receive from interest groups.
   The agreement, as outlined by a Democratic leadership source who
insisted on anonymity, also includes a demand for active White
House support and a commitment from party organizations to refrain
from using the pay vote as a political issue. Of course, there is
no way individual challengers to members of the House and Senate
can be forced to refrain from making a vote for a pay raise a
political issue.
   Rank-and-file lawmakers earn $89,500, and leaders get more. Any
pay plan would likely also include raises for federal judges and
top federal executives who also came out losers when the last pay
raise was rejected.
   Congressional leaders in both houses have publicly kept mum
about their plans for the politically explosive issue.
   ``We seldom whisper the words (pay raise), except in closets,
cloakrooms and bathrooms,'' said a House Republican leadership
source, speaking only on condition he not be named.
   But behind the scenes, there is movement.
   A bipartisan House task force has presented Republican and
Democratic leaders a proposal for raising congressional pay up to
35 percent over two years _ an increase that would apply to the
next Congress.
   The proposal, never formally announced, would be coupled with a
phaseout of honoraria _ the speaking fees often paid by groups
seeking to influence legislators. There also would be changes in
House ethics rules and laws, including a tightening of financial
disclosure, travel and outside income from professions and boards.
   Separate Republican and Democratic task forces have considered
the issue in the Senate, but have not made any proposals and appear
willing to let the House move first.
   Republican leaders will accept those conditions, but also would
like to tie a pay-ethics package to reform of campaign finance
laws, the GOP source said. Congressional task forces are also
trying to work out an agreement on that issue, but have not yet
done so.
   ``Last time, the Republicans backed out at the last moment,''
the Democratic source said. ``This is going to be coming out of a
bipartisan task force'' headed by Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif. and
Lynn Martin, R-Ill.
   House members were angry early this year when the Senate quickly
took a position against a pay raise, but privately expressed
support for a raise without a vote. ``Both sides need good
assurance they will deal with it in the same spirit,'' the
Democratic source said.
   In January and February, he said, ``The public felt something
was cooked up that wasn't being put on the record. This would be
straightforward.''
   The Democratic source predicted, ``Before the end of the session
we will have some sort of ethics package on the floor. But it's not
axiomatic that an ethics package would have to include pay and
honoraria.''
   The GOP source said chances for bipartisanship are much better,
now that Thomas Foley, D-Wash., has replaced Jim Wright, D-Texas,
as speaker. Republicans have given Foley credit for hearing
Republican views while Wright was considered more partisan.
   ``Bipartisanship in this current climate is realistic,'' the GOP
source said. ``Bipartisanship in the previous climate was not
realistic.''
   The House bore the brunt of the criticism last January when
Wright maneuvered for an immediate pay raise after members
privately egged him on.
   Leaders initially wanted to let the 51 percent raise recommended
by the presidential commission become law automatically, but at the
end of January, Wright abruptly switched tactics and decided to
allow a vote. Both chambers overwhelmingly voted last Feb. 7 to
reject the increase.
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer, whose congressional
watchdog group pushed last January for a pay raise coupled with a
phaseout of honoraria, said his organization would be active again
in favor of both.
   The group's major interest has been elimination of honoraria,
which Wertheimer called ``one of the most corrupting and corroding
forces in Congress today.''
   A Senate source, close to the Democratic task force in that
chamber, said ``We're not in this tricky procedural thing where you
can play games. It has to pass both houses and be sent to
president. Before, there were a lot of opportunities for mischief.''

   Gov. Carroll Campbell called Sunday for
churches nationwide to join an adopt-a-family program to help South
Carolina victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   ``We'll be back,'' Campbell said. ``With the spirit now in this
state, with the help of America and with the help of God, we'll
rebuild and we'll re-establish and we will endure.''
   Campbell urged churches in other parts of the country to contact
South Carolina affiliates for the names of families in need of
assistance. He asked the churches to provide ``spiritual, material
and moral support'' to adopted families for up to one year.
   Campbell promoted the program, unveiled in Columbia on Thursday,
during a speech to about 300 members of Citadel Square Baptist
Church, a 134-year-old church in downtown Charleston which suffered
some $250,000 in roof, window and other damage. His remarks were
taped for broadcast on the American Christian Television System.
   Hugo hit the Charleston coast Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds,
squashing scores of buildings and leaving thousands without
electricity and other necessities. The storm killed 29 people on
the U.S. mainland and 33 in the Caribbean.
   The storm killed 18 people in South Carolina and did an
estimated $5 billion in damage in 24 counties.
   About 3,000 of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas' 132,000
Charleston-area customers remained without power Sunday, said
company spokesman Bill Lide.
   ``This long-term recovery process is going to take long-term
support,'' the governor said. ``Many families have lost everything.
They are not going to bounce back from those circumstances. It's
going to take months and maybe years for some of them to get back
on their feet.''
   Campbell said the program was the idea of his wife, Iris.

<HEAD>Suburban Chiefs of Police Want Credit for Cocaine Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chiefs of five small police departments
have protested what they consider undeserved credit given to Los
Angeles police for the seizure of a record 19 tons of cocaine.
   At stake, the chiefs said in a letter to local newspapers and
television stations, is due recognition of their efforts and shares
of the $12.4 million in cash confiscated with the cocaine on Sept.
28.
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates told the City Council on
Wednesday that his department could expect up to $2 million of the
$12.4 million for its role in the seizure.
   But police chiefs in Arcadia, Bell, Huntington Park, Maywood and
South Gate said Los Angeles played a minor role in the raid on a
warehouse in Sylmar, providing backup security while their
investigators and federal agents searched the warehouse.
   Officers from five smaller departments and two federal Drug
Enforcement Administration agents did surveillance work that led up
to the raid, the chiefs said.
   ``We feel that those cities that were actually responsible
should get the credit, and along with that comes the money,'' Bell
Police Chief Manuel Ortega said Saturday. ``LAPD will get a share
but certainly not the $2 million that Chief Gates spoke of.''
   The chiefs also complained about the amount of attention local
media devoted to Gates' role in the affair.
   Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for Los Angeles police, said the
media repeatedly ignored Gates' frequent praise for the smaller
departments.
   Federal drug officials have not announced a formula for dividing
up the money seized in the Sylmar drug bust, but said the money was
deposited in an unidentified downtown Los Angeles bank.
   In most cases, a hearing is held before the assets are
distributed to law enforcement agencies. A federal magistrate
determines how much, if any, of the assets represent ill-gotten
gains and should remain confiscated.
   Booth said the city would abide by whatever formula is used by
the federal government.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II left for Indonesia
Monday after challenging South Korea's president to move his
country toward full democracy and praying for reunification of the
two Koreas.
   ``The Korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet
able to become one in peace and justice,'' the pontiff said Sunday,
speaking alternately in Korean and English at an outdoor Mass
attended by 700,000 people.
   John Paul told the vast throng of the faithful of his desire to
visit China, and he offered prayers for the people of Asia's
communist nations, including North Korea, just 30 miles from Seoul.
   At an earlier meeting with President Roh Tae-woo at the Blue
House presidential mansion, the pope challenged the South Korean
leader to make every effort to eradicate any traces of
authoritarian rule, a Vatican spokesman said.
   John Paul, who said there had been big steps toward democracy
since he first visited South Korea five years ago, told Roh that
South Koreans want full democratic rights and freedoms, according
to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   ``This present visit enables me to note the strong desire of all
your people to proceed along the way to ... a prosperous and
tranquil civil life and to generous and fruitful cooperation with
the other nations of the world,'' the pope told Roh.
   A statement by the presidential palace said the two leaders
discussed the international situation and relations with communist
North Korea, but it made no reference to domestic political issues.
   South Korea has made considerable progress toward democracy in
the past two years, and most Koreans agree they now have a large
degree of political freedom. But the government still imposes
restraints on left-wing and other radical groups, and hundreds of
anti-government dissidents have been jailed for political activity
in recent months.
   The vast crowd at the outdoor Mass waved white Korean flags and
wept as the pope arrived at the immense asphalt plaza in southern
Seoul to celebrate the end of the 44th International Eucharistic
Congress. Many worshipers arrived before dawn.
   John Paul offered prayers for the people of communist North
Korea and China, calling them ``our brothers and sisters.''
   China broke relations with the Vatican in 1957 and recognizes
only its own ``Patriotic Catholic Church,'' which names its own
bishops. The Vatican estimates there are 2 million Chinese loyal to
the pope.
   A choir of hundreds sang hymns in Korean as the pope walked
along a red carpet toward a four-story-high stage and altar, tiered
with thousands of red, white, yellow and pink flowers and flanked
by white, yellow and blue banners.
   Plainclothes South Korean security agents carrying attache cases
containing machine guns ringed the stage and 11,000 police were
deployed on the outskirts of the plaza. Those who attended the Mass
had to go through metal detectors.
   About 2,000 priests, aided by 2,000 women in traditional Korean
gowns, served Communion while 1,200 white doves were released as a
sign of peace. Prayers were offered in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish,
German, French, Korean, English and other languages.
   Cardinal Stephen Kim of Seoul said in his welcome that the
church issued an invitation to North Korea to send delegates, but
they did not come.
   ``This indicates that the division of the mind is more painful
than the division of land,'' he said.
   The Korean peninsula, divided in 1945, is the site of one of the
world's most bitter ideological confrontations. The capitalist
South and the communist North, which fought to a stalemate in the
Korean War, are still technically at war and maintain huge armies
along their 150-mile border.
   John Paul offered a prayer for reunification of the divided
peninsula, a theme he stressed at two services Saturday.
   The pope arrived in Seoul Saturday. After his visit to Indonesia
and East Timor, he will travel to the Indian Ocean island nation of
Mauritius. He is to return to Rome on Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Oakland Athletics Going to The World Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oakland Athletics won their second straight
American League pennant on Sunday, beating the Toronto Blue Jays
4-3 to win the divisional playoffs in five games.
   The Athletics, with the best record in baseball the last two
seasons, will open the World Series at home next Saturday against
the winner of the National League playoff, either the San Francisco
Giants or the Chicago Cubs.
   Before Sunday night's game, San Francisco had a 2-1 lead over
Chicago in the best-of-seven playoff.
   Dave Stewart outpitched Dave Stieb for the second time in the
American League series as Oakland became the first team to win
consecutive league titles since the New York Yankees and the Los
Angeles Dodgers each did it in 1977-78.
   Oakland's Rickey Henderson stole the series and was named Most
Valuable Player. Henderson got on base 14 times in 23 plate
appearances andof the creditworthiness of the Soviet Union by
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. or another credit-rating firm would be an
important boost for the Soviet Union should it try to tap the U.S.
bond market as part of its modernization drive.
   The Soviet Union returned to foreign bond markets for the first
time in 70 years when it sold a debt issue in Switzerland in
January 1988. Since then it has sold five more bond issues in
Western Europe, mostly to banks, for a total of about $850 million
worth of borrowing, according to S&amp;P.
   But it has yet to attempt a bond issue in the United States. One
reason is that it must first settle about $193 million worth of
bonds sold by Czarist Russia to the U.S. government to help finance
Russian participation in World War I. After the 1917 revolution,
the new Soviet government repudiated the bonds and has yet to make
good on them.
   Under U.S. law, the Soviets are barred from selling bonds here
until they settle this old debt.
   A 1986 settlement with Great Britain over a similar Czarist bond
offering bodes well for negotiations now under way with the State
Department on the U.S. bonds, S&amp;P said.
   The credit rating agency said many problems stand in the way of
assessing the investment risk of Soviet bonds.
   Among them are the unreliable and incomplete nature of Soviet
government statistics, lack of comparability between some Soviet
and Western economic data, and the lack of firm figures on total
Soviet borrowings in the West.
   ``Right now, analyzing the Soviet economy is a game of
estimations,'' said Philip Bates, an S&amp;P analyst. ``It's a new
frontier to some degree.''
   Bates declined to comment on whether Soviet officials have
agreed to cooperate with a credit analysis should S&amp;P decide to do
one. But, he said, ``It's a little difficult to obtain that
information without being able to talk to the government about it.''
   A credit rating is important because it helps investors
determine the chances that their money will be repaid when a bond
come due. It also gives them an idea of the rate of interest they
should require to tie up their money.
   Ironically, the attempts of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
to restructure his nation's economy, called perestroika, could harm
the country's once-sterling credit standing among Western bankers,
who have loaned it money since the early 1970s. With perestroika
has come instability and an economic downturn.
   ``The system that was in place gave bankers a lot of confidence
in the Soviet government's ability to repay their obligations,''
Bates said.
   However, he said, it appears that much of the Soviet
government's ability to adjust the nation's balance-of-payments
figures in order to repay foreign debt remain in place.
   A book published earlier this year is skeptical of the Soviet
Union's recent Western borrowing. ``The Coming Soviet Crash:
Gorbachev's Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial
Markets,'' contends that Soviet economic statistics are extremely
unreliable and that assumptions about the nation's ability to repay
its debt may be erroneous.
   The author, Hoover Institution researcher Judy Shelton, also
criticizes the popular belief that the West is accelerating
Gorbachev's reforms by loaning money. She contends that instead of
reducing military spending or making other tough economic choices,
the Soviets are looking abroad for the cash to pay for perestoika
while preserving their military might.
   S&amp;P's chief competitor, Moody's Investors Service Inc., has not
rated the Soviet Union either, but it recently released a credit
study of Hungary, another East bloc nation undergoing economic
liberalization. Hungary also has been selling bonds in the West.
   Moody's analyst Michael Van Bemmelen said obtaining the required
information about Hungary took longer than the time spent for
similar evaluations of Western nations. But he said his company is
confident about the results.
   Though there were problems in obtaining government data about
the domestic Hungarian economy, he said, ``most of the determinants
of the creditworthiness are really in its relationship to Western
countries.''
   That type of information is available from several sources, he
said, including international banks and exporters and importers.
   But Van Bemmelen said he could foresee additional problems in
rating the Soviet Union, such as valuing its huge gold holdings.
The Soviet government does not disclose that amount.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills Senior Police Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded Sunday in a
town near Belfast, killing a senior police officer and wounding his
wife, police reported.
   They also said Belfast police found a bomb hidden in a prison
where most of the inmates are suspected terrorists and the
explosive device was part of an escape plan.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the car bomb in
Lisburn, 8 miles west of Belfast. A police spokesman said the
explosion killed Superintendent Alwyn Harris and slightly injured
his wife.
   The spokesman was unable to say if the Harrises were in the car
at the time or if the car was parked or moving. Area residents said
the victims were on their way to church when the bomb went off.
   Harris, 51 and a 33-year veteran of the force, was the third
senior policeman killed in Northern Ireland this year. He had been
on sick leave with a heart ailment.
   Two other high-ranking officers, Chief Superintendent Harry
Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, were shot to death by
guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army in March as they crossed
the border after a meeting with police in the Irish Republic.
   Belfast police said they found a four-pound bomb made of the
plastic explosive Semtex hidden in a toilet at the high-security
Crumlin Road prison, which holds about 500 prisoners. Most are
awaiting trial on terrorism charges.
   A police investigator said, ``There is no doubt that this was a
serious escape attempt and we are extremely relieved to have foiled
it.''
   During four hours of violence in Belfast Saturday night 15
vehicles were hijacked and many were burned, police reported.
   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a British
province where Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics 3-2, with the
predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland. The 20-year-old
conflict has claimed more than 2,700 lives.

<HEAD>Mason Criticizes Giuliani Campaign Staff</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Jackie Mason says the staff of
Republican mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani is so ``incompetent''
that it's hard to know if ``they're running a campaign or they're
running for their life.''
   Mason resigned under pressure from the Giuliani campaign Sept.
27 after remarks that the rabbi-turned-comedian made about blacks
and Jews were published in the Village Voice.
   ``I never saw a more incompetent group of people in my life,''
Mason says of the Giuliani campaign staff in the Oct. 16 issue of
New York magazine.
   ``They look like they don't know if they're running a campaign
or they're running for their life or they should be running for a
bar on Second Avenue.''
   The Voice quoted Mason as saying Democratic mayoral candidate
David Dinkins ``looked like a black model without a job'' and that
Jews vote for blacks because they ``are sick with complexes.''
   In the New York magazine interview, Mason complained about what
he called a double standard that finds Giuliani guilty of racism
when the candidate links Dinkins with Jesse Jackson.
   ``Yet when Dinkins connects Giuliani to Ronald Reagan, he's
considered a political fighter,'' he said.
   But Mason said that ``twenty years ago, the white people were
racists and the blacks were the victims. Today, it's exactly the
opposite.''
   Mason, star of the ABC series ``Chicken Soup,'' also lashed out
at Mayor Edward I. Koch and Jewish leaders.
   Koch's criticism of Mason's remarks are ``like a Nazi calling a
Jew a bigot,'' he said.
   ``Jews are professional victims who practically beg their
persecutors to keep persecuting them,'' he said. Jewish leaders
``do this out of their own sick fears, their own persecution
complexes.''

   Riot police attacked demonstrators in East Berlin
on Sunday, driving thousands of protesters from a pro-reform rally
at a church and from a sit-in on a major avenue, witnesses reported.
   A number of people were injured and at least 30 people were
detained in the police actions Sunday in East Berlin, witnesses
said. No official reports were given.
   Paramilitary troops and police with attack dogs forced
demonstrators into sidestreets as the protesters shouted ``We want
freedom!'' and ``No violence!'' Residents held candles out their
windows in support of the demonstrators.
   It was the second day of violence between police and
anti-government demonstrators.
   Hundreds of people were arrested during demonstrations in the
capital and five other major cities Saturday, which marked the
communist country's 40th anniversary.
   About 5,000 people had been in or near Gethsemane Church during
a pro-democracy vigil and an estimated 2,000 people staged a sit-in
on the nearby Schoenhauser Allee after authorities blocked them
from joining the church vigil, witnesses said.
   Thousands of the activists left the church area after successful
negotiations between church officials and police to begin letting
the demonstrators through police lines, witnesses said. Many then
joined the protesters on the Schoenhauser Allee.
   However, police moved in to drive demonstrators into sidestreets
several times, beating many of them with truncheons and clubs and
using trucks with steel-mesh barriers in front, witnesses said.
   Many apartment dwellers lighted candles in their windows and on
balconies to show solidarity with the demonstrators.
   A middle-age man who watched the action from his apartment
window said: ``It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocks
and Molotov cocktails are going to fly.''
   East Germany accused the Western news media of encouraging
Saturday's protests. It refused to renew the visas of dozens of
Western journalists who were in East Berlin for the two-day visit
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that ended Saturday. The
reporters were told to leave the city when their visas expired at
midnight Sunday.
   Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheons
repeatedly charged demonstrators in East Berlin on Saturday and
early Sunday. Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged the
protesters away, and roughed up Western journalists covering the
demonstrations.
   At least one Western reporter, Sunday Times of London
correspondent Peter Millar, was detained for six hours.
   The East German protests were the largest since a workers'
uprising was put down by Soviet forces in 1953.
   Gorbachev's reform policies have made him popular among many
East Germans and protesters chanted his name and called for his
support.
   Despite the growing unrest and the exodus of thousands of East
Germans to the West, East German leader Erich Honecker said during
talks with Gorbachev Saturday that he would stick to his hard-line
course.
   Also Sunday, a group of pro-democracy activists announced they
had formed a Social Democratic Party. The party's charter was
signed by 43 people in Schwante, near Berlin.
   The group's charter calls for a ``rigorous democratization of
state and society'' and says the party wants to ``work with all
democratic initiatives, groups and people in our land.'' Leaders of
the group indicated they would not immediately apply for the party
to be legalized.
   A prominent reform group, Neues Forum or New Forum, was recently
banned by the communist government. New Forum says it has grown
from its original 30 members to more than 11,000.
   An estimated 15,000 people joined in pro-reform demonstations
over the weekend in East Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Potsdam, Jena
and Plauen, according to West German television and witness
accounts.
   The Hessischer Rundfunk radio station in Frankfurt, West
Germany, said 700 protesters had been arrested in East Berlin
alone, although witnesses said the number could be more than 1,000.
   Lutheran church leaders called for the release of the detainees
and appealed for calm.
   ARD, a West German television network, showed television footage
of helmeted East German police in riot gear charging demonstrators
in the historic city of Leipzig, hitting them with truncheons even
after the protest had been broken up.
   In East Berlin the official East German news agency called the
protesters ``troublemakers.''
   There were strong indications of support even from those who did
not take to the streets.
   Apartment dwellers rushed to their balconies to urge on
thousands of protesters with sparklers, cheers and applause. In a
crowded, smoke-filled bar, a young East Berliner shouted ``Happy
Birthday police state.''
   For three hours early Sunday, AP-Dow Jones reporter Igor
Reichlin hid in the apartment of an East German family after he was
chased by police when trying to cover the protests. The family
risked prison sentences by refusing to open the door to the police.
   For the fourth straight day Sunday, East Germany barred Western
tourists from entering East Berlin. Tourists were turned away after
being told ``it is not possible today'' with no further explanation.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans via Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and Poland deeply embarrassed East Berlin's
leadership during the weekend anniversary celebrations.
   More than 48,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany since
Sept. 11, when Hungary defied its Warsaw Pact ally and opened its
western border. From early Saturday until early Sunday, 941 East
Germans reached West Germany, all via Hungary, West German
officials said.

<HEAD>Timman Draws Fifth Semifinal Game with Speelman, Keeps Lead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jan Timman of the Netherlands played a 43-move
draw with Jon Speelman of England in the fifth game of their World
Chess Championship semifinal Sunday to maintain a one-point lead.
   Timman leads 2.5-1.5 with an unfinished game from the fourth
round scheduled to resume Monday. A win scores one point and a draw
a half.
   Speelman recovered from an inferior opening position to gain
what many experts regarded as good prospects to win. But Timman
maneuvered and it was Speelman who had to defend carefully to hold
a draw.
   In the other semifinal Artur Yusupov took a timeout to postpone
his fifth game with fellow Soviet and former world champion Anatoly
Karpov until Tuesday. Yusupov trails Karpov 1.5-2.5.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov in a 24-game match starting in October
1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the Candidates'
finals in March.
   Yusupov will use the two free days to prepare his fifth game
where he will open with the advantage of the white pieces.
   In their sixth game scheduled for Tuesday, Speelman will play
white against Timman.

   A vandal threw paint on windows and walls
of the Jewish State Theater over the weekend in an attack linked to
the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at Auschwitz, police
reported.
   The vandal painted the message, ``This is for the convent.''
   Worshippers saw the damage as they arrived Sunday night to mark
the beginning of Yom Kippur, the most solemn Jewish holiday, at
Warsaw's only synagogue that is next to the theater.
   Police said the blue paint had been splattered on the building
Saturday.
   The theater, created by the state shortly after World War II,
presents plays in Yiddish, preserving a cultural remnant of what
was once one of Europe's most vibrant Jewish communities.
   ``A lot of nasty and unexpected things have happened recently,''
said Rabbi Menachem Joskowitz, a survivor of the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz who emigrated this year from Israel to serve as Poland's
only rabbi. ``Synagogue windows have been broken in Lublin and
Czestochowa,'' he said.
   The rabbi said the violence was a result of controversy over the
convent of Carmelite nuns on the perimeter of the Nazi
concentration camp in southern Poland. Jewish leaders have demanded
that the convent be removed, saying Christian symbols are intrusive
at a place where 2.5 million Jews were murdered.
   Catholic Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow agreed in 1987
to relocate the convent, but a 1989 deadline was not met and the
Polish church said the agreement was not valid. After the Vatican
intervened in the dispute in August Polish bishops agreed again to
move the nuns to an international prayer center.
   On Saturday, the Polish episcopate issued a statement saying it
hoped the prayer center will ``contribute to development of
Christian-Jewish dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect and
understanding of the importance of the Auschwitz Nazi death camp
... for Poles, Jews and other nations.''
   The Jewish demands angered some Poles who said the nuns harmed
no one and should be allowed to pray for the tens of thousands of
non-Jewish victims killed at Auschwitz.

   A fire apparently ignited by an
incendiary bomb broke out on a bus in Bogota Sunday, authorities
reported. They said seven people were killed and at least seven
were injured.
   No individual or group claimed responsibility.
   Police said they had no way of knowing if the incident was
related to a wave of bombings by drug traffickers.
   The bus driver, Luis Fernando Pataquiva, told the radio chain
RCN that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb in the back of
the bus and it exploded moments after they got off.
   Police said seven people were killed and seven injured, but
local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured.
   ``Apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb,'' a
national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. She did
not elaborate.
   Police earlier said the noon fire appeared to have been caused
by a short circuit in the vehicle's electrical system..
   Radio station Caracol reported that a policeman at the scene
said the fire apparently started in a five-gallon plastic container
of gasoline in the back of the bus.
   No one has claimed responsibility for scores of bombings in
Colombian cities since the drug traffickers and government declared
war on each other in mid-August after the assassination of a
presidential candidate. The killing was blamed on drug traffickers.
   Before Sunday's bus explosion there had been 148 bombings that
killed at least 10 people and wounded 164.

   Communists at a historic congress have
proclaimed their party's death and the birth of a Socialist Party
aspiring to Western democratic ideals. But the difference between
the old and the new remains unclear.
   A document approved overwhelmingly by the congress Saturday
terminated the Communist Party _ called the Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party _ and proclaimed the Hungarian Socialist Party its
successor.
   It was the first time a Warsaw Pact Communist party formally
terminated its existence. The move was part of preparations for the
first free national elections in 41 years.
   On Sunday, the party daily Nepszabadsag appeared without its
customary title-page citation from the Communist Manifesto:
``Workers of the World Unite.''
   Instead of the usual masthead proclaiming Nepszabadsag the
central paper of the Hungarian Socialist Worker's Party, Sunday's
edition simply identifed it as a ``socialist paper.''
   Although the congress document sought to define ideological and
practical differences between the old and the new party, senior
officials differed over what that really meant.
   Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers, true to his role as a moderate,
said the document served ``the rebirth of our party as a new
left-wing Socialist Party.''
   But Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy was less optimistic that the
congress had managed to bury the repressive Leninist past and
create a party in the Western democratic tradition.
   Asked if the Hungarian Socialist Party was truly new, he told
reporters Sunday: ``I don't see the signs of that, although I
honestly would have welcomed it.''
   Since the congress opened Friday, radical reformers have
insisted that orthodox Communists would have no place in the new
party.
   But members of the old party are also members of the new party _
at least temporarily. ``I am not convinced that the so-called
cleansing (of ranks) that is necessary actually has happened,''
Medgyessy said.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, a key reformer, told the congress that
any new party would have no room for ``those with blood on their
hands'' from past Communist exceses.
   Membership is not automatically transferable. The position paper
said those wanting to join the new party would first have to state
their intentions in writing.
   But drastic language that would have barred Communist
conservatives was watered down out of fears the majority would
reject the document. The paper stated instead that the new party
wants to ``call in its ranks all those who agree with its platform,
agree with its ground rules.''
   Such ambiguity has resulted in the unsual development of former
Politburo member Janos Berecz _ among the most vehement opponents
of reform _ asking to join the new party Saturday, just hours after
he declared himself ready to be ``tied to the stake'' for his
Communist beliefs.
   Nyers, whose moderate views make him the most acceptable
candidate for the post of party president, told Berecz he was
welcome. It was a graphic demonstration of the new party's
difficulties in breaking with the past.
   Berecz later confounded conference participants by declaring he
wanted the issue of a new party put to the vote among all members
of the old party. He said in the meanwhile, he would remain a
member of the old party.
   In another indication that some orthodox Marxists feel the new
party is not substantially different from the old, Berecz supporter
Robert Hoch told the congress the Berecz faction was dissolving
``because we have accomplished our goal'' of saving the ideals of
the old party.
   But there are striking differences, on paper at least, between
the old and the new.
   The document condemned the old party's Stalinist excesses,
stating that its successor ``separates itself from the crimes,
(and) the principles and methods that were proven wrong'' during
the 41-year tenure of the Communists that included the failed 1956
uprising _ the Soviet bloc's bloodiest revolt.
   The Hungarian Socialist Party ``wants to contribute to the
development of a ... multiparty system parliamentary democracy,''
the document proclaimed.
   While expressing support of some state ownership, the document
also called for private enterprise with minimal controls.
   Despite formal loyalties to Marxism-Leninism and the
proletariat, the old party had gradually moved toward greater
liberalism under former leader Janos Kadar.
   Amid growing dissatisfaction with the pace and extent of reform,
Kadar lost his post in May 1988, opening the way to sweeping
changes.
   The preponderantly reform-minded leadership allowed political
opposition to flourish for the first time since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948. It went even further in February,
agreeing to hold the first free elections in 41 years and promising
to abide by the results.
   The elections are scheduled for next June at the latest. The new
party is expected to reveal its true nature well before then, as it
elects local officials in the next few months.

   Capt. Henrick Kurt Carlsen, a sea
captain who gained international attention in 1952 for staying
stubbornly aboard his crippled freighter for seven days as it
slowly sank, has died at age 75.
   Carlsen died Saturday at his home in Woodbridge.
   On Dec. 29, 1951, Carlsen was the 37-year-old captain of the
freighter Flying Enterprise when a storm ripped open the ship's
hull in the English Channel.
   After ordering the 40 crewmen and 10 passengers overboard, he
remained with the ship, owned by American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines
of New York, so the vessel could not be claimed for salvage by
another company.
   On Jan. 5, 1952, as another storm began to threaten the ship,
Carlsen and a companion jumped overboard and watched from the
tugboat's deck as the ship sank into the Channel near Falmouth.
   Born in Denmark, Carlsen came to United States in 1938. He
worked for the New York-based shipping line from 1944 until his
retirement in 1976.

   A father was arrested and charged Sunday
with using a chain saw to cut up a car allegedly driven by his son
during a hit-and-run accident that killed a 15-year-old girl.
   Vincent Senisi, 45, and Vincent Senisi Jr., 23, were being held
in connection with the death of 15-year-old Jeanine Tolentino of
Dix Hills, said Police Officer Salvatore Yovino, a spokesman for
Suffolk County Police.
   The elder Senisi was charged with criminal tampering with
physical evidence; his son was charged with leaving the scene of a
fatal accident.
   Yovino said the younger Senisi was driving his 1989 Chevrolet
Corvette on Route 110 when the car struck the girl as she was
crossing the street.
   The driver left the scene of the accident and drove to his
workplace, a landscaping business in West Babylon, Yovino said.
   He said Senisi then allegedly asked his father to cut up the car
with a chain saw in what police say was an attempt to dispose of
the evidence.
   The two, residents of the same address in Deer Park, were being
held by county police in Babylon and were to be arraigned Monday
morning.

   Frances Fletcher of Jacksonville was pronounced dead at 9:11
a.m. at a Jacksonville hospital.
   Witnesses said the woman was attacked by the three dogs when she
went into her front yard early Sunday.
   A bystander, Doug Hill, 19, used a baseball bat to beat the dogs
off the woman. He said the dogs were dragging her down the street.
   Animal control officers have cited the dogs' owners for allowing
them to run free and said other charges are possible. The dogs were

   Another outbreak of violence struck this
country at war with drug lords Sunday as fire blamed on a bomb
killed seven people on a bus and the body of an army secretary was
found riddled with bullets.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but the
attacks came in the midst of a 7-week-old war that drug traffickers
and government officials have been waging.
   Also Sunday, there were accusations and denials over allegations
that President Virgilio Barco's government explored possibilities
of a truce with the Medellin drug cartel.
   The driver of the bus in Bogota, Luis Fernando Pataquiva, told
the RCN radio network that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb
in the rear that exploded moments after they got off.
   Police said seven people were killed and seven injured, but
local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured.
   ``Apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb,'' a
national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. She did
not elaborate.
   Radio station Caracol reported that a policeman at the scene
said the fire apparently started in a five-gallon plastic container
of gasoline in the back of the bus.
   Police said they found the body of Mrs. Nury Veelasquez de
Vasquez, private secretary of the commander of the Fourth Army
Brigade, shot 18 times.
   Unidentified men dragged her from a taxi in Medellin on Friday
and took her with them in their car, police said.
   Police said they found her body next to a car near the town of
Marinilla about 8 miles northwest of Medellin.
   Authorities said they had no motive in the crime, but the Fourth
Army Brigade has been active in confiscating property of suspected
drug traffickers.
   Before Sunday's reports of violence, 148 bombings and other
attacks blamed on drug traffickers killed at least 10 people and
wounded 164 since Aug. 19, when the traffickers declared war on the
government.
   The government declared an anti-drug crackdown Aug. 18, the same
day leading presidential hopeful Sen. Luis Carlos Galan was
assassinated.
   Joaquin Vallejo, a former interior minister, said in reports
published Sunday that he acted as a go-between in truce
negotiations between the Medellin cocaine cartel and the government
before the anti-drug crackdown began.
   The new interior minister, Carlos Lemos Simmonds, denied that
the government had talks with drug traffickers.
   ``The government received a proposal and immediately answered
`no,''' he told reporters outside the presidential palace moments
after being sworn in, replacing Orlando Velasquez.
   Also sworn in Sunday was Roberto Salazar Manrique as minister of
justice and Enrique Danies as communications minister.
   The report of the negotiations was published Saturday in the
Bogota daily La Prensa, an opposition-owned newspaper. Vallejo
backed the La Prensa account in interviews published by two other
Bogota newspapers, El Tiempo and El Espectador.
   Valleho served briefly as interior minister in the 1970s when
the Conservative Party was in power. It is now in opposition to
Barco's governing Liberal Party.
   According to the La Prensa report, the Medellin cartel was ready
to abandon its cocaine-processing business, turn over its arms,
laboratories and airstrips and help the government fight other drug
traffickers. In return, the traffickers asked for amnesty and
guarantees not to be extradited to the United States.
   Vallejo said in the interviews that indirect negotiations that
began in September 1988 between the Medellin cartel and the
government ended after Galan was killed. Police said Galan, a
Liberal Party member slain while addressing a campaign rally, was
killed by drug dealers.
   La Prensa's initial story Saturday on the purported negotiations
between drug traffickers and Barco's government was seen as a
challenge to the credibility of the president's declared battle
against the cocaine barons.
   La Prensa claimed Barco had approved the contacts with the
traffickers.
   ``This is going to generate a huge national debate,'' Fabio
Valencia, an opposition Conservative Party senator, was quoted by
El Espectador as saying. ``It seems to me that the government
continues to handle matters with a double morality.''
   Barco has said repeatedly he will not negotiate with the drug
barons.
   He has issued decrees allowing the extradition of drug
traffickers to the United States and the seizures of their
property. Colombian authorities have already extradited one alleged
Medellin cartel kingpin and have siezed hundreds of properties
allegedly belonging to the cartel.
   Two of La Prensa's main owners are Misael Pastrana and Belesario
Bentancur, both former presidents and members of the Conservative
Party.

<HEAD>No Incidents During Voter Registration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second of four voter-registration
days for February's elections proceeded without incident Sunday,
Electoral Council officials said.
   Opposition representatives in one city said, however, that they
would file a complaint about irregularities.
   Officials earlier had said they hoped to register 500,000 voters
Sunday, but they had no figures available late in the day because
information was incomplete from the 4,934 registration precincts.
They said figures should be available by the middle of the week.
   In Leon, 55 miles west of Managua, a representative of the
opposition National Opposition Union said by telephone the group
will present complaints about alleged registration irregularities
committed by electoral officials. There were no immediate details.
   Before elections take place Feb. 25, officials hope to register
1.92 million Nicaraguans age 16 and older. Voter registration is
taking place during the four Sundays in October.
   The government said more than 370,000 people registered to vote
last Sunday on the first day of registration. It said registration
was hampered in some rural areas last Sunday because of rebel
activity, but no such incidents were reported this time.
   Soldiers were stationed at voter registration locations in rural
provinces where anti-government guerrillas have been active, the
government said.
   The Defense Ministry reported three rebels and one government
soldier were killed Saturday when insurgents attacked a military
patrol in El Nisperal, 130 miles southeast of Managua.
   Rebel attacks have been sporadic this year since a cease-fire
was signed between the government and rebels known as Contras. Five
Central American presidents agreed in August to resettle the
Contras, most of whom are based across the border in Honduras. In
return, the Nicaraguan government has promised free elections and
political reforms.
   The Contras have been fighting the ruling Sandinistas since
1981. They claim the Sandinistas' shift to the far left betrayed
the revolution that ousted conservative President Anastasio Somoza
in 1979, ending 42 years of family rule.

   President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida's
military government caught the nation and aspiring politicians by
surprise Sunday with its decision to dissolve prospective parties
and create two from scratch.
   Babangida, in a nationwide radio address Saturday night, said
none of the 13 parties that applied to be one of two legal parties
``had passed the test as imposed by our vision of a new political
order.''
   The candidate parties had ties to earlier parties that showed
signs of being ethnic groupings the military would not tolerate,
Babangida said.
   Babangida said limiting the country to two parties, funded only
by the government, was the only way to avoid the parties becoming
hostage to regional, ethnic or religious groups in this West
African country of 100 million.
   David Iornem, spokesman for the People's Solidarity Party, said
Babangida's move was an attack on the political class.
   Dr. Said Ngamdu of the Nigerian National Congress Party said,
``My heart bleeds when I think of the colossal amount of money,
time, physical and mental energy expended by the National Electoral
Commission and the political associations (parties).''
   Nigeria, an oil-producing nation that has seen its economy near
collapse from mismanagement, corruption and falling oil prices, has
been ruled by military men for 20 of its 29 years since
independence from Britain.
   The government's strict austerity program, adopted at the
insistence of international creditors, sharply reduced the standard
of living. Demonstrations against the measures erupted into riots
that left at least 43 people dead in May.

   The Bush administration was preparing covert
action to seize Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
during a coup attempt last week but the uprising collapsed before
the plan could be executed, top officials said Sunday.
   President Bush made the decision near the end of a failed coup
last Tuesday, and the order was conveyed to the commander of U.S.
forces in Panama, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the White House national
security adviser.
   ``The message that was sent was that if there were an
opportunity to do this, without risking bloodshed and significant
loss of American life, and to do so without open military
involvement, then he was free to go ahead, the commander on the
ground was free to go ahead,'' Baker said on the NBC-TV program,
``Meet the Press.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that at the outset of the
coup, he told Thurman to be prepared to use peaceful means to take
custody of Noriega, but the chance never came.

   Communists at a historic congress have
proclaimed their party's death and the birth of a Socialist Party
aspiring to Western democratic ideals. But the difference between
the old and the new remains unclear.
   A document approved overwhelmingly by the congress Saturday
terminated the Communist Party _ called the Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party _ and proclaimed the Hungarian Socialist Party its
successor.
   It was the first time a Warsaw Pact communist party formally
terminated its existence. The move was part of preparations for the
first free national elections in 41 years.
   On Sunday, the party daily Nepszabadsag appeared without its
customary title-page citation from the Communist Manifesto:

   While House leaders don't like to publicly use
the words ``pay raise,'' they are quietly shaping a scenario under
which Congress can vote to increase its pay with bipartisan accord
and the blessing of President Bush.
   Still smarting from the political fiasco last February under
which Congress was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percent
raise, House leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for the
next attempt to raise lawmakers' salaries.
   Foremost among them were that there will be a record vote and
that the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out of
speaking fees members of Congress receive from interest groups.
   The agreement, as outlined by a Democratic leadership source who
insisted on anonymity, also includes a demand for active White
House support and a commitment from party organizations to refrain
from using the pay vote as a political issue. Of course, there is
no way individual challengers to members of the House and Senate
can be forced to refrain from making a vote for a pay raise a
political issue.

childhood ditty: ``In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.''
   In addition to finding that one in four do not know Christopher
Columbus made his famous landing in the Western Hemisphere prior to

other basic facts about history and literature.
   Nearly 60 percent did not know the Korean War started when Harry

   Wildlife specialists squared off
Sunday for a bitter fight over how to keep Africa's fast-dwindling
elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys
and chess pieces.
   Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet until Oct. 20
at the biennial conference of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES. The
conference began Sunday with strategy sessions and formally opens
Monday.
   Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, the
salmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species,
attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory.
   By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, for
many an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoos
by the turn of the century.

   IBM is offering early retirement to 1,000 of its
employees; Borden's plan to reorganize its dairy operations will
cost 7,000 jobs, and the megabuyout of RJR Nabisco will result in
more than 1,600 layoffs.
   Business optimism appears to be dimming, and manufacturers are
becoming more aggressive in cutting costs and people. But a
relatively steady unemployment rate _ which has fluctuated between
5.1 percent and 5.3 percent since April _ means somebody is hiring.
   The question is, who?
   Steven Haugen, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
says job growth is concentrated in the service sector, that broad,
amorphous category covering everything from data processing to
theme parks to the neighborhood beauty parlor. Experts say this
sector is creating upwards of 1.5 million jobs a year.

   It is perhaps no small irony that a
highly sought Japanese auto plant was built on a road known as the
Bataan Memorial Highway, memorializing a bitter U.S. defeat to the
Japanese on a Philippine peninsula and the resulting ``death
march'' in which thousands died.
   Or is it?
   The Bataan highway signs are down because of road improvements,
but there are no plans to change the name of Ind. 38, the address
of Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., which is bringing as many as 3,200
jobs to the Lafayette area, Mayor James Riehle said.
   ``It's a reminder, at least in my style of thinking, of the
horrors of war,'' Riehle said.
   Don't forget it was the United States that helped rebuild
Japanese industry after the destruction wrought by World War II, he
said.
   ``You can say their success has been our success, too.''
   The success or failure of the joint venture won't be known for
years, but already Lafayette has succeeded in recruiting what will
be its largest employer after Purdue University, in spurring other
development and in laying the groundwork for future expansion of
the city.
   ``Projects that had been planned for some time in the future are
being looked at and perhaps expedited,'' said Riehle, who has been
mayor 17 years.
   Those projects include a 33 percent upgrade in the capacity of
the wastewater treatment plant and extension of a 24-inch water
main southeast of the city into an area that basically doubles the
infrastructure for business.
   ``It gave the county a whole new system of expansion,'' said
Susan Quick, a local property broker. ``Retailers are starting to
look at this area much more closely.''
   Ms. Quick is co-developer of Park East, a 247-acre retail,
office and warehousing development planned along Ind. 26 east of
Lafayette and a couple of miles north of the Japanese auto plant.
The project predates the plant, but Ms. Quick cannot ignore her new
neighbor.
   ``The car plant was just great for us.''
   Ms. Quick said she and others in the community believed at first
there was no need for a huge auto plant that might upset the
balance of an already thriving community with an unemployment rate
of 3 percent.
   Mark S. Davis, president of the Greater Lafayette Progress Inc.
and the leader of local development efforts, said the joint venture
offered the local economy diversification and high-paying jobs with
good benefits.
   ``These are the best manufacturing jobs we could go after,''
Davis said. ``It gets into fairness or equity. Not everybody wants
to be a software engineer.''
   The Lafayette area has lost many other jobs recently, including
about 600 at General Foods and 250 each at Pillsbury and North
American Phillips operations, Davis said.
   ``Economic development is not a game. It is a deadly serious
business, with human, family impacts. The deaths are not the issue;
births are the issue. If you're creating jobs, your community will
continue to prosper,'' Davis said.
   Nonetheless, the plant also has stirred some fear and prejudice.
   The Rev. Carl Malmgren, pastor of the First Baptist Church, said
the arrival of the plant fueled unfounded rumors that Japanese were
buying a local country club to indulge their passion for golf.
   They were uglier aspects, too. Some people who got jobs at the
new plant were isolated by former co-workers, Malmgren said.
   ``I think the big thing is fear that gets played on _ fear of
the unknown, fear of things we have no control over,'' Malgren
said. ``I don't really believe the arrival of the Japanese is the
issue. The issue is change that can no longer be handled.
   ``The Japanese became a lightning rod.''

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of Arab
Oil Exporting Countries said Sunday it will hold talks in December
with the European Economic Community.
   The OAPEC group will be led by Mana Saeed Oteiba, oil minister
of the United Arab Emirates, in talks intended to enable the two
sides to exchange views on energy-related matters.
   The meeting at the European Community's headquarters in Brussels
will be the second of its kind in a decade, said Abdul-Aziz
al-Wattari, OAPEC assistant secretary-general.
   The organization is composed of the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Algeria, Libya and
Tunisia.
   Among the OAPEC states are five members of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, which has been trying to persuade the EEC to
lift duties on petrochemical exports under a trade cooperation pact.
   The council also is in contact with the EEC to assess the impact
of the single European market coming into force in 1992 on their
relations, particularly on Gulf overseas investments.
   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the U.A.E., along with
Oman, which is not a member of OAPEC, account for roughly 20
percent of the non-Communist world's 52 million barrels per day of
oil output, and hold 45 percent of global oil reserves.
   Seven OAPEC states also are members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which also recently initiated
contacts with the EEC on cooperation in stabilizing world oil
prices.

   Arab petroleum-producing
countries were urged by experts Sunday to increase exploration in
order to boost reserves and prevent shortages in the next century.
   Current Arab oil reserves plus recoverable reserves and
anticipated discoveries can satisfy oil demand until 2020, said
Abdul-Aziz al-Wattari, assistant secretary-general of the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``But a gap between supply and demand will then occur unless new
reserves are discovered to help meet the accelerating demand for
energy from hydrocarbons,'' Wattari said in an inaugural speech of
a four-day seminar in Abu Dhabi.
   The four-day seminar on ``Deep Formations in the Arab Countries:
Hydrocarbon Potential and Exploration Techniques,'' is the first of
its kind in the Gulf and was organized by OAPEC and the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co.
   Wattari told over 70 participants that world energy consumption
has been increasing in recent years and was expected to continue
rising in the coming years.
   ``Increases in oil production and reserves should match that.
And some oil experts forecast that oil production will peak at 75
million barrels per day in the year 2010,'' he said.
   Daily world oil output currently is 62 million barrels, of which
the Arab world accounts for roughly 18 million barrels.
   He urged Arab states to make use of new advanced exploration
techniques developed in Western countries.
   ADNOC General Manager Sohail al-Mazroui, backing Wattari's call,
said expanded oil exploration was ``essential in order to guarantee
the continuation of petroleum supplies at their current level.
Experts believe there will be an increased global dependence on
Arab oil as reserves of other oil-producing nations will vanish in
the future.''

<HEAD>Trumka Says Strike Will Continue Until Contract Reached</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka
promised Sunday that the union's bitter strike against Pittston
Coal Group Inc. will continue until a contract is reached.
   ``How long are we willing to go? One day longer than Pittston,''
Trumka told a solidarity rally attended by 1,500 miners and
retirees and their families.
   The UMW has been striking Pittston in Virginia, Kentucky and
West Virginia since April in a contract dispute over health and
insurance benefits.
   Miners from West Virgina, Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio attended
the rally pledging to continue selective strikes against Pittston
and other companies the union says supplies the nation's second
largest coal exporter.
   Last week, a Virginia judge fined the union $6.9 million for
illegal strike activities, bringing the total fines assessed during
the strike to more than $30 million.
   But Trumka said the union has enough money to continue the
strike.
   ``We have ample resources to take care of our strikers
indefinitely,'' said Trumka. He added that striking miners now are
eligible to apply for $1,000 interest-free loans from the union.
   Last week the 80,000-member UMW rejoined the 14 million-member
AFL-CIO after a 40-year separation.
   Trumka said the affiliation merely formalized a working
cooperation the miners' union has had with the AFL-CIO.

<HEAD>Officials Urge Industrialized Nations To Help on Debt Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Kuwaiti officials on Sunday urged major
industrialized nations to play a key role in resolving the debt
problem of the Third World.
   Abdul-Rahman Al-Atiqi, adviser to the emir of Kuwait and a
former oil and finance minister, accused the industrialized nations
of ``fraudulence'' and warned that the ``political aspect'' of debt
was being overlooked.
   Atiqi addressed a symposium attended by about 400 prominent
economists and bankers from the United States, Britain and the Gulf
Cooperation Council, which consists of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
   Market solutions to the international debt crisis is one of the
topics being discussed at the symposium, which focuses on the
impact of globalization of markets on the GCC countries.
   ``What the creditor rich countries are proposing for resolving
the debt crisis is nothing more than fraudulence aimed at shackling
the states of the Third World and absorbing their resources,''
Atiqi said.
   ``The rich countries did not grant loans to poor developing
countries out of compassionate motives, but rather for winning them
as subservient states that rotate in their orbits, to become
markets for their goods and test fields for their weapons of
destruction,'' he added.
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, has launched
an initiative for alleviating the indebtedness problem of the Third
World, a plan Atiqi called more favorable.
   The emir proposed before the U.N. General Assembly last year the
writing off interest paid by poorest countries on their debts as
well as part of the principal. He also called for an international
conference on resolving the international debt crisis.

<HEAD>Generic Drug Maker Complies With FDA Call To Recall Medication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pharmaceutical maker on Sunday voluntarily
began the recall of a generic antibiotic used to treat urinary
tract infections a day after the federal Food and Drug
Administration requested the action.
   The FDA contends that Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc., based in
Copiague, cheated on product safety tests when it submitted the
drug, nitrofurantoin, for FDA approval.
   Robert Shulman, president of the company, said in a statement
that the recall of the 100 mg capsules was in response to questions
raised by the FDA.
   ``Bolar is concerned first with the ongoing well-being of the
people who use our drugs,'' Shulman said. ``The charges that have
been made against this product and our company warrant this
cautious move on our part while we investigate to determine where
the truth lies.''
   An FDA investigation found indications that Bolar substituted
the brand name drug Macrodantin for its generic version in tests
three years ago to win approval of the generic product, FDA
spokesman Jeff Nesbit said.
   ``We believe that this occurrence is not of Bolar's doing,''
Shulman said, adding that the product tested by the FDA was not the
same product it provided for laboratory testing.
   Because of the evidence of a substitution, the FDA contends it
is not possible to determine whether the Bolar product is
equivalent to the brand-name product, which is made by
Norwich-Eaton Pharmaceuticals.
   Bolar, which is the largest of the generic drug makers under FDA
scrutiny, won approval for its generic version of nitrofurantoin in
June 1988.
   Bolar's product is the only generic drug approved as
therapeutically equivalent to Macrodantin, although other dosage
forms of nitrofurantoin are available.
   The FDA also is investigating other generic drugs made by Bolar
as part of its probe of more than a dozen generic drug companies in
the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption within the industry
and FDA's generic drug division.
