   Senator negotiators agreed Tuesday to boost
the war on drugs to $9.4 billion, capping a week of talks with the
White House and lifting a Republican blockade that stalled action
on four money bills.
   ``It seems that everything is worked out so we have an
agreed-upon package,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the chief
Senate negotiator.
   As part of their deal, Republicans and Democrats agreed that
later this year, the Senate would consider elements of a
crime-fighting package unveiled by President Bush in June but
dormant since then.
   With the agreement in hand, the Senate passed two of four
appropriations bills that had been stalled by Republicans for more
than a week in a move to gain leverage in bargaining over the drug
package.
   Within an hour the Senate passed a $14.4 billion foreign aid
measure and a $157.4 billion bill for labor, health and education
programs.
   The White House indicated its approval of the agreement earlier
in the day before it was cemented. Presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the outlines of the plan appeared
``consistent with our objectives.''
   ``We do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can
get on with implementing the drug plan,'' Fitzwater said.
   The negotiations began early last week after Democrats proposed
to add $2.2 billion to the $7.9 billion proposed by President Bush
in his Sept. 5 address to the nation on the scourge of drugs.
   They said that education, treatment and prevention programs were
underfunded in the administration's battle plan for fighting the
drug war.
   The freshly minted package funds the Bush administration's
initial $7.9 billion war on drugs plus $400 million in other
crime-fighting money requested by the president in June as well as
$200 million for juvenile justice programs and the $900 million
boost that had been the center of week-long negotiations.
   The $900 million would provide $100 million for law enforcement
and the rest for prevention, education and treatment, the ``demand
side'' of the drug war that Democrats say was underfunded in the
president's original plan.
   ``Without building up the demand side, then we're really caught
fighting the drug war with one hand behind us,'' Byrd said.
   Actually, the $200 million for juvenile justice already was
contained in a bill to provide money for the State, Commerce and
Justice Departments. Moving them into the drug package, raised the
total added by the Senate to $1.1 billion, exactly half the amount
that Byrd initially had sought.
   The increase would be funded through reductions in other
spending programs that would be 0.43 percent if applied
across-the-board. Under the plan, however, appropriations
subcommittees would be able to pick and choose among programs,
allowing some to escape the full brunt of the cuts.
   Many elements of the president's crime-fighting package are
contained in the drug strategy, but some highly controversial
elements are missing and the administration has been pushing for
action on them.
   They include applying the death penalty to a wider range of
crimes than under current law.
   Another key provision would place limits on the number of
appeals that could be filed by certain prisoners, and a third would
ease restrictions on how police and prosecutors obtain certain
kinds of evidence.

   Handicapped protesters who occupied a federal
building for two days won a pledge of government support Tuesday,
but failed to win an order requiring wheelchair lifts on all new
public buses bought with federal funds.
   The Department of Transportation ``cannot issue a summary order
commanding immediate access including wheelchair access for all
transit,'' said Steven Diaz, chief counsel for the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration, who met with the protest leaders.
``We would if we could.''
   But Diaz said DOT officials and the protesters had agreed on
three points:
   _Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner will be urged to meet
promptly with disabled activists to ensure a ``principle of
accessibility'' until Congress passes the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
   _The protesters will be allowed to continue a ``symbolic
presence'' at the Richard B. Russell building in downtown Atlanta.
   _Officials will relay to Skinner the protesters' concern that
new rules for handicapped accessibility to air travel are not being
drafted quickly enough.
   ``This agreement by no means resolves the problem of access; it
just brings us a step closer,'' said Mark Johnson, 38, of
Alpharetta, one of the protest leaders who met with Diaz and other
DOT officials.
   He said he didn't know if the protesters would leave the
building, where they blocked elevators and entrance doors earlier
Tuesday. But by late Tuesday, it appeared the protesters had left;
none were visible inside the building.
   ``We may stay here through Thursday, or we may just leave a
sticker on the wall. There could be a constant vigil at the
building, or we could all leave,'' he said earlier.
   The protest by members of ADAPT, or American Disabled for
Accessible Public Transportation, began Monday when Skinner was in
Atlanta to address the convention of the American Public
Transportation Association. At least two dozen protesters chained
themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs Monday.
   Authorities attempted to eject several protesters from the
building Monday evening, but President Bush intervened and let them
spend the night inside rather than send them out into the rain.
   On Tuesday, the protesters made good on a threat to block
entrances to the building's main level at noon if their demands
were not met by then.
   About two hours later, while federal officials met with protest
leaders outside the building, about 160 chanting, singing activists
kept federal employees and visitors from using 12 of the 14
main-floor elevators by blocking them with wheelchairs.
   Security officers were able to keep two elevators open by using
plant stands to keep wheelchairs away from them.
   About 100 protesters spent Monday night in the building, eating
take-out food and sleeping under blankets provided by attendants.
Early Tuesday, a group of Atlanta bartenders brought them coffee
and doughnuts.
   ``It was an uncomfortable night,'' said Rick James, 39, of Salt
Lake City. But he added: ``The misery that we're going through is
worth it if we get what we want. All we are asking for is a lift on
every bus so that we can be more independent. We're not asking for
a million dollars.''
   But government officials have estimated that putting wheelchair
lifts on all new public buses would cost $90 million a year.
   ADAPT also has been trying to force the installation of lifts on
all new buses through the courts. In Philadelphia, a federal
appeals court panel backed their lawsuit, saying federal law
requires lifts on new buses.
   But in July, the full 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned that ruling, saying government officials did not have to
put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving
the handicapped would be better.
   Michael Churchill, an attorney for ADAPT, said the group was
waiting to see what Congress did on the bus issue before deciding
whether to appeal.

   President Bush joined a galaxy of Hollywood
celebrities Tuesday night in paying tribute to the American Film
Institute on the 24th anniversary of the federal arts legislation
that gave it birth.
   Eyeing the black-tie crowd that included actors Charlton Heston,
Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Travolta and Christopher Reeve and
actresses Marlo Thomas and Brooke Shields, master of ceremonies
Jack Valenti crowed: ``Welcome to Washington, D.C., the
entertainment capital of the world.''
   Valenti, the longtime head of the American Motion Picture
Association and onetime White House aide to Lyndon B. Johnson,
added, ``There are things that happen here that a Hollywood
scriptwriter would give his life to be able to put down.''
   It was Johnson who signed the legislation on Sept. 29, 1965,
creating the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities,
which two years later spawned the independent, non-profit American
Film Institute.
   The institute has been a leader in efforts to preserve motion
pictures and television, and trains young directors through a
program in Los Angeles.
   Bush joined in the entertainment at the gala at the National
Building Museum, following a string of celebrities who repeated
famous movie lines. Bush, looking across the ballroom to his wife
Barbara at a table 30 yards away, repeated Humphrey Bogart's toast
from ``Casablanca'':
   ``Here's looking at ya, kid!''
   Bush called film ``the mirror of America ... and also in a sense
the conscience of America.'' He cited such films as ``Coal Miner's
Daughter,'' ``Hoosiers,'' and several recent movies that portrayed
drugs in a bad lights, including ``Lean On Me,'' ``Clean and
Sober'' and ``Dancing As Fast As I Can.''
   ``I want to thank the film industry for helping stop this
terrible threat to our kids. ... I welcome your leadership,'' said
the president.

   A Washington teen-ager was arrested Tuesday on
charges of selling the crack cocaine that President Bush displayed
on television to illustrate the seriousness of the nation's drug
problems.
   Keith Jackson, 18, was indicted earlier in the day by a federal
grand jury on four counts of unlawfully distributing crack and one
count of using a telephone to help arrange an alleged sale.
   The alleged distribution started in April, on one occasion near
Eastern High School in Washington in July, according to the
indictment.
   Jackson was picked up at his home in southeast Washington by
city police and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, said DEA
spokesman Cornelius Dougherty.
   U.S. Magistrate Pattrick Attridge ordered Jackson held without
bond pending another hearing Wednesday.
   In a Sept. 5 televised speech, Bush held up a clear plastic bag
containing a handful of crack nuggets and said they had been seized
across the street from the White House a few days previously.
   The alleged dealer was lured to Lafayette Park _ not one of
Washington's drug markets _ four days before by undercover drug
agents after White House staffers asked for a sample from the
vicinity of the White House to show that dealing could happen
anywhere.
   Officials of the DEA said they had planned to make the purchase
a few blocks away before the White House request.
   The transaction with an undercover DEA agent was photographed,
but the dealer was not taken into custody then because agents hoped
he would sell a larger amount later and identify his supply
organization, officials said.
   A planned arrest last week fell through when the suspect did not
show up.

   Gunmen believed to be communist
rebels ambushed and killed two American civilians working at a U.S.
military base Tuesday, shortly before Vice President Dan Quayle
arrived to discuss the future of U.S. military installations in the
Philippines.
   On Wednesday, Quayle condemmed the killings as ``cowardly
murders'' and said the slayings will ``only serve to strengthen''
U.S. support for President Corazon Aquino.
   Meeting with Mrs. Aquino later, he proposed that talks begin in
December on extending U.S. military bases in the country.
   Police arrested at least 15 people on Wednesday for joining
rallies protesting Quayle's visit. U.S. officials banned
non-essential travel between U.S. bases by the 40,000 American
troops, civilian employees and military dependents in the
Philippines.
   There is growing opposition among Filipinos to the U.S. bases.
   Following his hour-long meeting with Mrs. Aquino, Quayle told
reporters he delivered a letter from President Bush suggesting the
talks on the future of the six bases, whose lease expires in
September 1991.
   The ambush victims were employees of Ford Aerospace Corp., which
contracts to maintain an electronic warfare training range at Camp
O'Donnell. The camp is a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north of
Manila and 12 miles from the U.S. Clark Air Base.
   Ford Aerospace spokesman Norman Black identified the victims as
William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald G. Buchner, 44. He said both
were retired from the U.S. Air Force. Their hometowns were not
available.
   The Americans slowed their car as they approached a dump truck
and a jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60 miles north of Manila,
police said. Six men jumped out of the jeep and riddled their car
with gunfire, according to police Lt. Pepito Pimentel.
   The assailants then opened the car door and pumped bullets into
the victims, Pimentel said. The attack occurred about 5 p.m.
   ``We deplore this senseless and cowardly act of terrorism,''
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington.
``Acts like this will not deter us in our resolve to support the
democratic government in the Philippines.''
   Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokesman for the Philippine
Constabulary in central Luzon island, said the assassins were
believed to be members of the New Peoples Army, which operates in
the area.
   In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James Rowe as he was
driving to the headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military Assistance
Group in Quezon City, near Manila. In October 1987, rebels killed
three Americans in simultaneous attacks outside Clark Air Base.
   Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a member of Mrs. Aquino's
presidential guard, about a mile from where the president met with
Quayle on Wednesday.
   The United States operates Clark, the Subic Bay naval base and
four smaller installations in the Philippines, but there are
increased calls for an end to the U.S. military presence.
   Mrs. Aquino has offered new talks on the U.S. bases but refuses
to say whether she will support an extension. Any new agreement
must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate,
where opposition to the bases is strong.
   In a statement released Wednesday, the New Peoples Army called
Quayle's visit ``part of the intensifying pressure by the United
States on the Aquino regime'' to extend the bases.
   ``This pressure covers all aspects, economic, political and
military,'' the rebels said. ``The United States is overextending
legal means and is using dirty and underhanded tactics to achieve
its ends.''
   As Quayle arrived from Japan Tuesday evening, hundreds of
leftists burned his effigy and an American flag while chanting
``Bases out!, Quayle go home!''
   In a speech Wednesday to a business group, Quayle deplored the
killings of the two Americans.
   ``It should go without saying that these cowardly murders
deserve the strong condemnation of all civilized men and women,''
Quayle said. ``The people of the Philippines, like the the people
of the United States, are sickened by the acts of vicious
terrorists who wish to drown freedom in the blood of innocent men
and women.''
   Two hours before Quayle's arrival, about 150 members of the
League of Filipino Students and the Youth for Nationalism and
Democracy reached the airport terminal and began a noisy
demonstration against the visit.
   After negotiations with police, the group agreed to pull back
about a half mile away. Police estimated the crowd grew to nearly
1,000 by the time Quayle arrived.
   Earlier, nine policemen were injured and nine students arrested
when security forces broke up a rally at Manila's Adamson
University, officials said.
   Also Tuesday, suspected rebels killed Capt. Carlos Daileg, a
staff officer of the Presidential Security Group, in an ambush in
the city's Pandacan district.
   Police and troops have been on alert in the capital following
bombings in Manila that have killed two people and injured 16 since
Sept. 16.

   With thousands of East Germans going West in the
past few months, those staying behind have found themselves without
the services of some important people _ from the village baker, to
the town plumber, to medical specialists.
   There are visible signs of the ``people drain'' in East Berlin.
   An official sign on a shuttered bar called ``Restoration 1900''
says the establishment has received ``permission to close'' because
the manager is ill.
   Local residents say that in truth, the manager fled to West
Germany two months ago.
   ``An operator of three other bars in this area also went West a
while back. He's since been replaced,'' said a middle-age East
German walking past the bar on the city's Husemannstrasse.
   A vegetable shop a few blocks away is shuttered as well, and
residents say its owner also has gone to the West.
   East German reform activist Jens Reich says his eye doctor has
fled to West Germany. ``I fear my dentist's gone as well,'' said
Reich, an East Berlin founder of the fledgling New Forum
pro-democracy group.
   About 100,000 East Germans have either fled or emigrated legally
to West Germany this year, the greatest flood of East German
refugees since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. More than 17,500 of
them have gone through Hungary since that country opened its
Western border to East Germans Sept. 10.
   The refugees say they left their homeland because they could no
longer bear the lack of democratic freedoms and because they want
better lives in the West.
   The exodus has produced a new rash of demands for political and
economic reform among many East Germans who remain behind. Within
two weeks of the exodus, Reich's group collected signatures of more
than 2,000 citizens supporting its pro-democracy demands.
   Church officials in East Germany have intensified their calls
for democratic change as well. They say leaving the country is no
way to change it.
   ``Someone who is in Bavaria cannot be of service to a patient at
the Catholic hospital in Erfurt (East Germany),'' East German Roman
Catholic Bishop Joachim Wanke has said.
   Sources within the ruling Communist Party, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the drain of medical personnel is so severe in
the district of Suhl that doctors there have been forbidden to
travel out of the country.
   Officials have not released any figures on how the exodus has
affected medical care or any other professions or businesses.
   The West German Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said Sept. 18 it
was told by church officials a number of hospitals have had to
replace employees ranging from student nurses to chief physicians.
   The refugees who have fled West in the past few months are
mostly young people who left behind good jobs, and in many cases
promising careers.
   According to a study released Sept. 12 by West Germany's
Ministry for Inner-German Relations, the refugees worked in
industry, medicine and other service-sector areas, crafts,
administration and education.
   East Germany has a population of 16.6 million. No one has said
the refugee exodus means economic disaster, but the Communist
leadership has acknowledged it is causing problems.
   Residents across the country have reported that some department
stores are operating with drastically reduced staffs, many gas
stations are shortening their work days, and other establishments
are closing down completely.
   The Frankfurter Rundschau said that at times, cynical humor
takes over when those left behind talk about employees who have
gone West.
   ``A hairdresser in Erfurt coolly tells a customer: `So, you want
to make an appointment with Bettina? Then you'd better call Passau
or make a complaint to (West German Chancellor) Helmut Kohl,'''
said Rundschau.

   The city leaped at a chance to put
its ``Frog Crossing'' signs back up, and the mayor even thinks he's
figured out a way to keep souvenir hunters from slipping away with
them.
   ``I am going to have a T-shirt made of the frog-crossing sign,''
Mayor Scott Schultz said after the signs were re-posted last week.
``Maybe if we get people to buy T-shirts, they won't steal the
sign.''
   The two signs have been missing since shortly after they were
erected in July 1987 on a stretch of road through the Schmeeckle
Reserve. Suspicious minds linked the signs' disappearance with the
return of students that year to the University of Wisconsin-Stevens
Point.
   The signs were posted along two ramps that were cut in the curb
to help frogs and other small animals cross the road.
   A city worker came up with the design, featuring four frogs in
various stages of leaping.
   Recently, one of the original signs was recovered and repaired,
and officials decided to give it another try.
   ``The general reaction is that folks are glad the sign is back
up,'' Schultz said. ``The real purpose was to highlight that there
is a nature preserve.''
   When the first signs disappeared so quickly, official decided it
would be pointless to keep putting them up in a battle with
souvenir-hunters.
   This time, T-shirts aren't the only deterrent to theft, Schultz
said: ``They welded the bolts this time.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A million refugees have flooded back into
Beirut after six months of fighting, many impoverished by their
ordeal and some fearful lest the savage shelling flares up again.
   Long lines of cars began streaming into the shattered capital
within minutes of the announcement Friday by Christian leader Gen.
Michel Aoun that he was accepting an Arab League cease-fire.
   Hundreds more Lebanese booked passage for the three-hour ferry
crossing from Larnaca, Cyprus to the Christian port of Jounieh,
while others flew into the newly reopened Beirut airport.
   The six months of fighting killed at least 929 people and
wounded 2,741.
   Issam Baydoun, a Sunni Moslem bank employee who fled during the
shelling battles that pitted Aoun's mainly Christian fighters
against Syria and its Moslem militia allies, was among the
returnees.
   ``I have spent most of my 30 years' savings during the 2{ months
of forced migration to the south,'' said the 55-year-old father of
two.
   Baydoun said he fled his Beirut home in a seven-story apartment
building in the heavily shelled district of Ras el-Nabeh in July,
when ``things could not be borne anymore.''
   ``My wife had started taking sedatives,'' he said. ``My daughter
screamed every time a shell crashed nearby or because of the sound
of a rocket passing overhead.''
   Just like many other west Beirutis, Baydoun headed south. He
rented a two-room house for $900 a month in Iqlim Kharroub in the
Chouf mountains.
   ``In all, I spent $3,000 in only 75 days of exile,'' he said.
``Believe me, now that we're back I can't afford to restore my
shell-pocked house.''
   Asked whether he would be able to rent another house in the
south if fighting broke out again, Baydoun said:
   ``I am a conscientious employee and have a good reputation at
the bank. The bank manager might be willing to lend me some money
on temporary basis. But to tell you the truth, God knows when I
will be able to pay him back.''
   He was glad to be back, albeit impoverished, saying ``there's no
place like home.''
   The Baydouns' neighborhood is in a section of west Beirut where
Syria and its allies installed their advance artillery batteries.
On the opposite side are Aoun's troops as well as Christian
militants from the Lebanese Forces.
   East Beirut residents also breathed relief when the Arab league
commitee announced the opening of all crossings linking both
sectors of the capital, the lifting of the 6-month-old blockade of
the Christian heartland and the opening of the airport.
   ``May God guide them to the right path,'' said Samira Gobril, a
Maronite Catholic housewife who expressed hope that the leaders of
Lebanon's factions would work together for a durable peace.
   `` May God keep utmost in their minds the plight of the poor
population.''
   Mrs. Gobril, 38, and mother of an 11-year-old boy and an
8-year-old girl, lives in the frequently battered Christian area of
Ashrafieh a few miles from the Green Line that divides east from
west Beirut.
   She had fled to the fashionable mountain resort of Faraya, 20
miles to the northeast.
   ``This time we could afford it,'' she added, but ``it'll take my
husband five years of hard work to recoup the amount of money we
have spent during the last four months.''
   Police said at least 1 million refugees who fled Beirut have
returned since Friday. Beirut took the brunt of the shelling,
forcing all but 150,000 of its remaining 1.5 million people to flee.
   Some of those that did not travel to safer areas of Lebanon took
the ferry to Cyprus, either to wait out the fighting or to apply
for American, Canadian, Australian and other visas as a gateway to
a new life away from their country, shattered by 14 years of civil
war.
   Estimates vary. Immigration officials in Cyprus say about 20,000
Lebanese are on the small east Mediterranean island whose
population numbers just 691,000.
   But relief agency officials working to ease the refugees' plight
said the actual number of Lebanese in Cyprus probably reached
30,000 at the height of the fighting and perhaps more.
   The Christian refugees' only exit to the outside world has been
through a hydrofoil ferry service from the port of Jounieh north of
Beirut to Larnaca on the south Cyprus coast.
   Moslems, too, have been fleeing to Cyprus, though they are still
a minority of the Lebanese refugees on the island.

   Gary Liubakka is a newcomer to politics,
but he figures he's bound to get a hefty vote in next year's
gubernatorial race.
   That's because he's running as founder of the National Apathetic
Party. With a 60 percent voter turnout expected in the 1990
election, Liubakka can claim the other 40 percent of the electorate
as constituents.
   ``They won't vote, and a `no' vote is a vote for me,'' the
36-year-old contractor said recently.
   The unofficial party _ it's known as NAP _ even has a mascot: a
battered eagle.
   The bird's neck is longer than most eagles' because it's been
stretched a few times. Its left wing is clipped from giving away so
many handouts. Its tail feathers are lost.
   On the rare occasions Liubakka removes his tongue from his
cheek, he'll betray serious worries about the state of the body
politic.
   ``Our intention is to slap everybody in the face with
ignorance,'' the unregistered candidate said, ``and hopefully this
blunt hint will get them out to vote more.''

   The northern third of the country will have
more snow than usual but it'll be a mild winter for most of the
country, says no less an authority than the Old Farmer's Almanac.
   Abe Weatherwise, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's
oldest continuously published periodical,'' predicts a white
Christmas in New England. The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac
hits the newsstands and supermarkets this week with its familiar
planting and tide tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100
ways how to avoid untimely death. (No. 49, avoid combing hair in
the dark; No. 77, never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
   He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will
be balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In addition to weather predictions, the almanac has
advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets of winning lotteries
and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie.
   It also advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost
the popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   Among other predictions: the return of the 4-inch-wide necktie
for men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.

   Most everyone has heard of killer bees and
killer whales _ but what about killer snails?
   One man is determined to prove that the combative cousins of
common garden snails are the answer to eliminating the slow-moving
but voracious plant munchers. Raymond Harrie, 34, sells a hostile
snail breed that he claims will prey on the garden pests.
   ``It's the tough new snail on the block,'' Harrie said the other
day from his demonstration booth at the Los Angeles County Fair.
   The shell-less critters ambush garden snails, following their
slime trails and attacking them when they lay their eggs, Harrie
said. The bloodthirsty snails, known to scientists as Rumina
decollata, usually leave their victims mortally wounded, rather
than killing them outright, he said.
   Harrie, who sells the attack snails for $20 per 100, claims
they're too slow-moving to move from the garden to the house, and
pose no danger to children and pets.

   A bomb exploded Monday night in the
Cartagena Hilton on the Caribbean and reports said two doctors were
killed and another was wounded, the chief of the police in that
coastal resort said.
   Another bomb exploded at a Cartagena bank Monday night, injuring
a passer-by, Col. Luis Herrera told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   A fireman at the hotel told a Colombian TV news crew the blast
ripped through the sixth floor of the Cartagena Hilton, whose
majority owner is the Colombian government's National Tourism
Council.
   The bomb exploded in room 642, the Colombian radio chain Caracol
said in a report from the scene. The two doctors who were killed
were attending a medical convention at the hotel, Caracol said.
Their identities were not immediately available.
   The one who was injured was also thought to be Colombian,
witnesses told Caracol.
   Herrera said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombs.
   However, Colombian government security forces have presumed that
scores of bombs that have exploded in major Colombian cities in the
last month have been the work of drug traffickers who declared war
on the Colombian government.
   Including the two bombs in Cartagena and one Monday night in the
capital of Bogota, there have been 110 bombings, killing eight
persons and injuring 132 persons.
   The Hilton was evacuating the approximately 1,500 guests to
other hotels in Cartagena, Caracol said, quoting its correspondent,
who filed a report by radio telephone with Bogota.
   Thousands of Americans, Canadians and other foreigners flock to
Cartagena each year.
   A group of Canadian tourists at the Cartagena airport last week
told the wife of an AP reporter they were cutting their vacations
short and going home because the Canadian Embassy warned them of
the war possibly spreading to Cartagena.
   Police told the AP the third bomb was at a billing office of the
government electric company in Bogota, but that no one was reported
injured.
   It was the first time bombs hit Cartagena since drug traffickers
declared war on the Colombian government last month.
   A leading presidential candidate was quoted earlier Monday as
saying Colombia may have to legalize drugs in order to fight the
powerful cartels waging war on the government.
   Also Monday, two politicians said the government should
negotiate with drug lords.
   Representatives of the nation's 4,600 judges were to meet with
the acting justice minister, Carlos Lemos Simmonds. The judges
threatened Sunday to go on strike unless Simmonds promised them
better protection from drug cartels, who persistently threaten
their lives.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed, mostly by drug traffickers.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said in Washington
that U.S. officials sent 100 bulletproof vests and other security
items to Colombia last week to help protect judges. He said it was
the responsibility of Colombian officials to distribute the items.
   Four bombs exploded Sunday night in Bogota, but there were no
injuries, national police said.
   Sen. Ernesto Samper, seeking the government Liberal Party's
nomination for the presidential election in March, said of the drug
war: ``If the repressive action fails, the road left is
legalization of drugs.''
   Samper made the comment in an interview published Monday by the
Bogota daily La Republica. He is the first serious presidential
candidate to suggest legalizing drugs.
   The government began its crackdown on the drug cartels when
leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan was assassinated
Aug. 18 at a Bogota political rally.
   President Virgilio Barco, who by law cannot run for re-election,
said he would extradite drug lords to the United States, prompting
the cartels to declare war on the government.
   There have been reports the traffickers are willing to pay
billions of dollars to get the government to end its crackdown, but
Barco has refused to negotiate.
   The mayor of the city of Medellin, Juan Gomez, said Monday that
``after this war is over and there are many dead ... we are going
to end up at the negotiating table talking with the drug
traffickers.''
   ``The dialogue would be Christian because it would avoid many
deaths,'' the mayor said in an interview with Caracol.
   Also coming out Monday in favor of negotiations was the
president of the House of Representatives, or lower chamber of
parliament, Norberto Morales.
   ``We have to open the way toward this initiative because we are
bleeding to death (and) our economy is in ruins,'' Morales told
Caracol.
   On Saturday, Morales said two of Colombia's major drug
trafficking suspects had called him with an offer to negotiate with
the government. He said he passed the information along to Barco.
   Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha offered to invest
millions of dollars from their cocaine profits in Colombian
industry if a truce is reached, Morales said.
   Government officials have said in the past that drug traffickers
apparently invest the bulk of their money outside Colombia.
   Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha are on the Justice Department's list
of most wanted drug-trafficking suspects. They are the strongest
members of the Medellin cocaine cartel, which is said to supply 80
percent of the cocaine reaching the United States.
   The traffickers have made earlier offers.
   Recently, a U.S. narcotics official with the embassy in Bogota
said in an interview that the traffickers want pardons so they can
emerge from years of hiding.
   In return, the official said, the traffickers apparently offered
to move their operations to other countries, possibly Bolivia or
Peru.
   Also, he said, the traffickers suggested they would finance much
of the government's 30-year-old war against leftist guerrillas.
   The biggest offer from the traffickers came in 1984, when the
Medellin cartel offered to pay off Colombia's foreign debt, then
about $10 billion, in exchange for amnesty. The government refused.

<HEAD>Former President of United Rubber Workers Union Dead at 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Bommarito, president of the United
Rubber Workers Union for 15 years, died of cancer Monday at Akron
General Medical Center. He was 74.
   Bommarito, a native of Detroit, moved to the Akron area in 1966
to become president of the Akron-based international union.
   Known as ``The Bomber,'' a nickname he earned after his tour of
duty in the South Pacific as a Marine during World War II,
Bommarito was a high-energy president of the URW who saw the union
through a stormy four-month strike in 1976 against the major rubber
companies.
   When Bommarito retired in 1981, the URW had 140,000 members,
diminished by a number of plant closings from a peak of 190,500 in
1974. Dues-paying members now number about 100,000.
   Bommarito enlisted in the Marine Corps in early 1942. When he
returned to his factory job in Detroit after his tour of duty, he
was elected to the executive board of URW Local 101.
   By 1957, Bommarito was president of the 6,000-member local,
which is now defunct. In 1960, Bommarito was elected an
international vice president. Six years later, he was elected to
the union's top post.
   Bommarito is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and several nieces
and nephews.

   Commuters struggled through rush hour with
no traffic lights in Charlotte and power companies rebuilt electric
systems Monday, four days after Hurricane Hugo's remnants struck.
   Also on Monday, President Bush declared four inland North
Carolina counties disaster areas eligible for federal assistance.
   ``The damage has been extensive, and the progress has been
slower than expected,'' said Joe Maher of Duke Power Co. in
Charlotte. He said it would be a week or two before full service is
restored.
   About 280,000 Duke customers in North and South Carolina were
still without electricity, including Bill Lee, the utility's board
chairman.
   ``I feel like I'm in good company,'' Lee said.
   Preliminary damage estimates for hard-hit Mecklenburg County
rose to $336 million, but officials said the damage is so extensive
it is still difficult to gauge.
   Marie Shook, assistant manager of Mecklenburg County, estimated
that 120,000 county residents, mostly in rural areas, remained
without water Monday. County agencies, meanwhile, had 250 reports
of price gouging.
   In Lincoln County, rural residents who were without water
because of the power outages took showers at a high school.
Drinking water was distributed from four locations around the
county.
   ``I'm out of power at home myself,'' said Bob Willis, the
county's emergency management coordinator. ``But I have a daughter
close by with power, so I can get a shower and she won't let me go
hungry.''
   Two power company workers in Lincoln County were injured Monday
when a power line came loose and hit them. One worker was in
critical condition and the other was in stable condition, hospital
officials said.
   The loss of electricity made traffic signals useless as
Charlotte workers began their work week. A National Guardsman and a
Charlotte police officer directing traffic at a busy intersection
were hospitalized after being struck by a car during the morning
rush hour.
   The police officer was treated for a broken leg, while the
guardsman, a member of a military police company from Greenville,
was listed in stable condition with cuts to his face and thigh.
   About 550 National Guardsmen are on duty in North Carolina. More
than 200 North Carolina Forestry Division workers, including 56
chain saw crews, were deployed in Charlotte, Morganton and
Lexington.
   In Brunswick County, the only coastal county to sustain major
damage from Hugo, heavy rain slowed cleanup efforts.
   ``The rain is hampering us for certain,'' said Cecil Logan,
county emergency management coordinator. ``It will delay our major
cleanup efforts for at least a day.''
   Beach homes were left hanging over the surf all along the
county's coastline, with the dune line virtually wiped out in many
areas.

<HEAD>Met Opera Opens with Dream Cast in `Aida'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Metropolitan Opera chose ``Aida'' as its
opening night opera and gave it a dream cast.
   Aprile Millo, heralded as the next great Verdi soprano, sang the
title role on Monday night. Not content just to pour out her voice
of grandeur, she used shading, held notes and pianissimo and acted
the slave to Amneris that Aida is. Seldom has a Met Opera Aida been
so often on her knees.
   Placido Domingo, the Radames when this production was new last
December, sang Radames again. His voice was beautiful in tone,
smooth in production, sometimes ringing, occasionally tense and
harder-edged than it formerly was. He doesn't scoop up to high
notes, as most tenors do, in ``Celeste Aida.'' The final love duet,
when both inserted tenderness into their generous-size voices, was
thrilling.
   Dolora Zajick, who made her Met debut last fall, sang a notable
Amneris. She's a mezzo soprano but has a delivery like a soprano
and a confident stage presence. Some Amnerises are almost
unnoticed. When the two were together, this Amneris commanded more
attention than Aida. As Aida was subservient, the king's daughter
Amneris was regal. Miss Zajick's voice also conveyed Amneris' love,
making her a sympathetic character.
   Paata Burchuladze, from Tbilisi, U.S.S.R., was making his Met
debut as the high priest. Burchuladze, a winner in the 1985 Luciano
Pavarotti voice competition in Philadelphia, has the deep notes and
dark sound Americans expect and adore from Russian basses. He has
sung ``Boris Godunov'' in Vienna, Paris and Philadelphia.
   Sherrill Milnes sang Aida's father with urgency _ he's concerned
with the Egypt-Ethiopia war, not with love. Milnes also sang with a
beautiful tone, which characterized all the principals.
   The triumphal entry scene included a couple of horses and, for
once in a Met production, no eccentricity. Three young dancers in
Act 2 were pleasing.
   James Levine conducted with understanding. The production, by
Sonja Frisell, twice uses the device of moving a set by elevator,
thereby revealing the next set either above or below it. This is
dramatic and effective. The first time it was done, going from
Amneris' rooms to a public square full of Egyptians, the audience
gasped with appreciation.
   Though some were well gowned, women in the opening night
audience provided less a fashion show than in some years.

   Investigators hope Columbia's next
scheduled space mission won't be delayed by damage caused by a
surge of fire protection water that sprayed the shuttle.
   ``I have not given up launching on the 18th,'' said Thomas E.
Utsman, deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center who heads the
investigation into Sunday's accident. Columbia is scheduled for
liftoff on Dec. 18.
   Utsman said Monday the problem started when a valve failed, and
then two workers in their haste to shut off the system mistakenly
turned on most of the sprinklers.
   ``I'm chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and
human error,'' he said. ``The guys who did it were only trying to
help. ... Good intentions sometimes go wrong.''
   As many as 200 of the shuttle's 500 woven fiberglass heat
shields may have to be replaced, he said. The blankets, about the
size of a beach towel, protect the top of the shuttle
   ``The thermal blankets are our major concern,'' Utsman said.
   He said initial inspection revealed no damage to any of the more
than 20,000 silica thermal tiles. These are much smaller and
tougher than the blankets and are bonded to side and bottom areas
of the shuttle subjected to the highest heat.
   While there appeared to be no damage to electrical or electronic
systems, ``we won't know for sure until we power up the vehicle,''
Utsman said.
   He said investigators should know within a few days if the
launch will be delayed.
   ``If we have to replace only a couple hundred blankets, there
shouldn't be a hit,'' Utsman said.
   Utsman said the accident occurred Sunday after three workers
performed routine maintenance on the water sprinkler system in the
building where the shuttle was being processed.
   When the workers finished the job, they tested the system by
pressurizing it, but a gate valve that they were certain was closed
failed and water began flowing from sprinklers in one of six safety
zones.
   ``Two other workers who tried to help inadvertently turned on
the other sprinklers'' and water poured onto work platforms and
splashed onto the shuttle, Utsman said. Other workers were able to
quickly turn off the water.
   He did not know the amount of water released.
   He said a small amount of water leaked into the closed cargo bay
but didn't damage electronic systems there. He said no water
entered the crew cabin.

<HEAD>Honecker Resumes Some Duties; Pro-Democracy Protest, Refugee Wave
Tops 20,000</HEAD>

   East German leader Erich Honecker
appeared in public for the first time six weeks after gallbladder
surgery, putting to rest rumors he was gravely ill but facing a
crisis posed by an exodus to the West.
   West German officials say the number of East Germans that have
fled to the West since Hungary opened the floodgates on Sept. 11
has surpassed 20,000.
   As Communist East Germany nears its 40th anniversary, its
leaders say they are discussing reforms that could stop the flow of
refugees to the West, a phenomenon that is draining the country's
labor pool.
   The 77-year-old Honecker resumed some official duties Monday as
about 8,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig to protest his
government's refusal Monday to grant legal status to a
pro-democracy group called New Forum.
   Leipzig police arrested scores of demonstrators, many of whom
sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and shouted such slogans as ``Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity!''
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said Honecker, who had
not been seen in public since Aug. 14, resumed some official duties
on Monday, meeting with the new ambassadors of Zimbabwe and Turkey.
   East German Communist Party sources said the party chief was
expected to fully resume his duties by Oct. 7, when the country
marks its 40th anniversary. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
is expected in East Berlin for the ceremonies.
   After his mid-August surgery, some West German media reports
said Honecker's condition may have been more serious than indicated
by East German officials and that he had lost the will to live.
   The East German leadership has been hampered by Honecker's
protracted recovery, leading one Communist Party official to call
the country a ``ship without a captain.''
   West German media have said that some East German Communist
leaders have accused Honecker of misjudging the meaning and scope
of the exodus to West Germany, which grants East Germans automatic
citizenship because its constitution does not recognize the
division of Germany.
   Honecker, a hard-line Communist who has led East Germany since
1971, has staunchly resisted reforms sweeping much of the Soviet
bloc.
   As of early Monday, 20,130 East Germans had fled through Hungary
to West Germany since the channel to the West was opened, West
German border police said.
   In addition, more than 1,200 East German refugees waited in
cramped West German Embassy compounds in Prague and Warsaw, hoping
a diplomatic solution could be worked out to allow them to get to
the West.
   East and West German officials spoke several times by telephone
Monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations,
said Herbert Schmuelling, a West German government spokesman.
   Bonn is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a
``highly sensitive phase,'' Schmuelling told reporters.
   In Stuttgart, West Germany, the Communist Party chief for the
East German city of Dresden said he thinks changes are needed to
stop East Germans from leaving their homeland.
   Hans Modrow said he agreed with a recent remark by retired East
German intelligence chief Markus Wolf that the East German
government must think over the causes of the East German exodus.
   ``On this point I am of the same opinion as my friend Mischa
Wolf,'' Modrow said on the first day of a four-day visit to West
Germany.
   Modrow, however, refused to say what kind of reforms are needed
in East Germany. ``This is something we have to discuss at home,
not here,'' he said.
   The number of East Germans occupying West German embassies in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, has nearly reached its
saturation point, West German government sources said.
   About 980 East Germans have sought refuge inside the Prague
compound and 300 at the embassy in Warsaw, the sources said. Their
numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week.

   U.S. Rep. Roy Dyson admitted to mistakes
in judgment during a speech announcing his re-election, and
promised to return $18,000 in campaign contributions from people
linked to a defense contractor.
   Dyson also said Monday he would take ``ultimate responsibility''
for the embezzlement of $7,275 of his former top aide, who
committed suicide in May 1988 by jumping from a New York hotel.
   ``Mistakes were made by my staff. I have made mistakes of
judgment,'' the five-term Democrat told several hundred supporters.
``I regret the controversy these matters have caused, but I want
the people of Maryland to know that these were mistakes of the
head, not of the heart.''
   Dyson, a member of the House Armed Services procurement
subcommittee, said he was returning the contributions from
employees and consultants for Unisys, which is under investigation
by the U.S. Justice Department for possible contract procurement
violations.
   ``I am returning these funds because individual pleas entered as
part of the Justice Department's `Ill Winds' investigation point to
a systematic attempt on the part of Unisys to circumvent the
federal laws governing campaign contributions,'' said Dyson.
   The investigation involves charges that defense firms or their
employees hired private consultants who bribed Pentagon officials
for information needed to win multimillion-dollar contracts.
   The congressman also said he would donate to charity a $2,000
speaking fee he received from the Oshkosh Trucking Co. on the day
he voted in favor of a bill that benefited the company.
   Dyson said he will report the apparent violations in accepting
the speaking fee to the Federal Elections Commission.
   ``Because of these errors, I anticipate that the FEC will levy a
fine which the campaign will pay to the FEC as a civil penalty for
the violations,'' Dyson said.
   Dyson also told supporters that the late Thomas Pappas, his
former top aide, had improperly pocketed $7,275 in campaign funds.
   ``I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in
judgment because Tom Pappas was my campaign manager,'' Dyson said.
``I was not aware that Tom was writing checks to staff members and
asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him.''
   Luis Luna, an attorney who describes himself as ``an all but
declared'' Republican candidate for Dyson's seat, said the
congressman's admissions were welcomed but didn't go far enough in
explaining his connection to Unisys.

<HEAD>Money Issue May Slow Efforts for Consensus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants a consensus on improving
schools at the education summit starting Wednesday _ not more funds
for a ``basically well-fed'' system _ but some governors say more
money is a key issue.
   ``I don't think you're going to find a consensus'' on the issue
of money, said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who chairs
the National Governors' Association.
   Bush and several key Republican governors are adamant that the
two days of discussions at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, Va., will not focus on more money for schools.
   ``The educational system is basically well-fed but it's
undernourished, and we must find innovative, accountable ways to
improve performance,'' the president told reporters at a recent
briefing.
   However, a key concern of some governors, particularly
Democrats, is that without a federal financial commitment, the
states and local governments will be forced to reshuffle scarce
cash or impose higher taxes.
   ``We have enormous problems to surmount if we are to educate our
children, and we need a real federal commitment to that effort, not
just rhetoric,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a
Democrat who said that during the Reagan administration the federal
share of school funds fell to 6 percent from 9 percent.
   ``The real problem for the federal government and the president
... is how do you shift resources for greater investment instead of
ending up simply lecturing people on things they ought to do
without any real help,'' said Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a
Democrat.
   ``I am hopeful we will see some increased federal funding for
education,'' added South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson, a
Republican. ``But the federal government needs to balance its
budget. I think they are going to, rather than give us a whole lot
of money, begin to set an agenda and hold us accountable in the
spending of the money.''
   States already are pumping huge sums into education. For
example, Virginia spent $4,069 per pupil in 1987-88, up from $1,524
per pupil in 1978-79. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller, a Democrat, said that
over the past 10 years, state financial support for public schools
has risen by more than 100 percent.
   Branstad said, ``I think there is a feeling that there is
considerable amount of money being spent on education. We want to
spend it as wisely as possible.''
   Bush, who vowed to be the ``education president,'' has indicated
a willingness to free states from cumbersome federal rules that
dictate how some federal funds are spent.
   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota said it would be a
mistake for governors to ``hammer'' Bush at the meeting for federal
funding, but he stressed he would like more federal money for
preschool programs such as Head Start.
   According to Perpich, the money for basic kindergarten through
12th grade education should be provided by states.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, agreed. ``In terms of
federal funding, my biggest priority is for the federal government
to expand Head Start so that every eligible child has an
opportunity to enroll.''
   Educators said only about 20 percent of the eligible students
are served by the Head Start program that cost the government $1.2
billion last year. Bush has proposed a $250 million increase.
   Money could overshadow discussions on other topics such as
allowing parents to choose which public school their children will
attend, restructuring the learning environment, revitalizing the
teaching profession, and the proper role of government in education.
   The parental choice issue is the centerpiece of Bush's education
initiatives, and conservatives want the president to promote the
issue by challenging the governors to advance the idea at home.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said, ``the issue of equity
and transportation are key to the issue of choice.'' Asked who
would pay for school buses to take children to the school of their
parents' choice, he said, ``It's going to be a state-by-state
solution and it's going to be worked out.''

   You know all that junk mail that falls through
your mail slot every day? If the envelope is just plain brown, it
breaks Bill Garland's heart.
   Garland is a sales representative for the Tension Envelope
Corp., a firm which produces about one-fifth of all the envelopes
used by the direct mail industry. His territory is central Ohio and
he single-handedly sells 100 million envelopes a year, enough to
fill 70 semi-trailers.
   Direct mail is big business, getting bigger. Tension Envelope
has plants in 11 cities, many working two or three shifts, six days
a week, making envelopes, headed for your mailbox.
   Garland was selling envelopes here Monday at the Direct
Marketing Association's 72nd annual conference and exhibition,
which attracted 8,000 people in the direct mail and telephone
selling business and the people who serve them, like Garland.
   ``A plain brown envelope is insane,'' said Garland. ``The
biggest opportunity for blowing the product's whistle is lost.''
   He stood before a display of envelopes that were anything but
plain. Some had rippled edges _ ``zippers'' to the trade _ that all
but compel the recipient to open the envelope, which is the point.
   The latest wrinkle in envelopes is one in which the address flap
flips over, allowing the recipient to reply using the original
envelope.
   It saves storage space, Garland explained: ``If you insert a
return envelope into the outgoing envelope, and you're using a
million envelopes a month, you've got to find space for 2 million
envelopes, not 1 million.''
   Direct marketing likes big numbers. Some 88.5 million Americans,
it brags, bought something through the mail in 1988, and the
average mail-order purchase amounted to $74.
   The compilation of mailing lists, as might be imagined, is big
business because ``targeting'' _ sending the pitch to the most
likely customer _ is the name of the game.
   The American Student List Co. of Great Neck, N.Y., offers lists
of students from kindergarten through graduate school. For $50 a
thousand, you can buy the names and home and school addresses of
146,983 biology majors.
   PCS Mailing List Co. is even more specialized. It will sell you
the names and addresses of 11,438 air traffic controllers, 16,600
subscribers to Tax Angles; 15,547 auto wheel and frame alignment
shops; 1,381 disc jockeys; 7,260 T-shirt stores; 425,000 ``high
income women''; 10,620 hair and wig dealers or 532,390 professors.
   And National Demographics and Lifestyles Inc. of Denver,
pitching its ``relevant'' lists in a comic book, refers to folks
who respond to direct marketing as ``respondoids'' and describes
them as ``ever hopeful yet enslaved mail responsive mortals'' who
``long to fill out questionnaires about themselves and receive
relevant mail.''
   National Demographics gathers its lists from respondoids who
fill out those consumer questionnaires or product registration
cards that come with new hair dryers and toasters. Only 7 percent,
the company says, check the little box indicating they want to be
on no one's mail list.
   Lisa Caugherty, director of the association's Shop at Home
Information Center, says most people like direct marketing. The
3,500-member association has developed codes of conduct to protect
those who don't.
   A 15-page pamphlet spells out the ethics of the business
(``free'' should mean ``a product or service which is offered
without cost or obligation''). Another, aimed at policing those
telephone sales calls, says the callers should not make offers ``in
the guise of research or a survey when the real intent is to sell
products or services or to raise funds.''
   As for the latest twist, telephone machines which make a
recorded sales pitch, the rules say ``a live operator'' should
first introduce the recorded message. Moreover, the guidelines say,
calls shouldn't be made ``during hours which are unreasonable to
the recipients.''
   Whether that's supper time, the guidelines don't say.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Protests Public Service Spot Attacking Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few viewers are seeing it yet, but the auto
industry already is crying foul over a public service ad on global
warming that environmentalists are sending to radio and TV stations
nationwide.
   And Detroit wants equal time.
   The ad was unveiled a week ago by the Environmental Action
Foundation, which said it was distributing the 30-second spots to
hundreds of radio and television stations to spread the warning
about global warming and, specifically, what part the automobile
plays.
   Thomas H. Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, quickly dispatched a letter to 200 TV stations and 850
radio stations calling the ad ``clearly political'' and full of
misinformation.
   He wrote that if the environmentalists' spots are used as a
public service announcement ``we intend to demand equal time to
rebut the misinformation and misleading material they contain.''
   On Monday, Ruth Caplan, executive director of the
Washington-based environmental group, distributed a copy of Hanna's
letter at a news conference and accused the industry group of
trying to ``muzzle public education on the environmental impact of
automobiles.''
   She characterized the industry's call for equal time as
``ludicrous'' and denied the thrust of the 30-second advertisement,
which calls pollution from automobiles ``a major cause'' of global
warming, is misleading.
   In a telephone interview, Hanna defended his Sept. 19 letter to
the radio and TV stations.
   Hanna charged the environmentalists were misusing free air time
under public service provisions by making a political statement and
``advancing their legislative agenda ... That's grass roots
lobbying.''
   He maintained the ad overstates the threat of global warming,
which he said was still disputed in the scientific community, and
puts too much of the blame on pollution from U.S. automobiles.
   Carbon dioxide, which is released in the burning of fossil
fuels, is a major contributor to the so-called ``greenhouse
effect'' _ the creation of a gaseous veil in the atmosphere.
Scientists are concerned that if accumulation of these
``greenhouse'' gases goes unchecked, the Earth may warm
significantly by the middle of the next century.
   U.S. automobiles, however, are only one source of carbon dioxide
and are believed to be the source of only about 2.5 percent of all
the greenhouse gases worldwide, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. Nevertheless, a reduction of carbon dioxide
emissions from motor vehicles and other sources is widely seen as
essential to reducing the global warming threat.
   The environmental group's 30-second spot opens with a shot
directly into the sun and the announcer calling global warming ``a
disease of the Earth.'' It quickly pans a desert landscape and then
shifts to highway and city streets clogged with cars and trucks
while the announcer says ``a major cause of global warming'' is
pollution from automobiles.
   ``We need more fuel efficient cars,'' continues the announcer
over a scene of a family with its car, followed by a closeup of
arid, parched earth.
   Hanna said he would not object if the spots were run as paid
advertisements that give a point of view, but said the
environmentalists should not be given free air time.
   ``Detroit spends millions of dollars each year to advertise
their new model cars and light trucks,'' replied Ms. Caplan. ``For
the industry to request free air time to respond to our modest
public education campaign is ludicrous.''
   Hanna said there are no plans to prepare a counter-ad in case
equal time is granted by a TV or radio operator. But he said
spokesmen would be available to ``make people aware there's another
point of view.''

<HEAD>Former Reagan Official Disputes Warnings on Hispanics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican Hispanic says conditions for
Hispanic youth aren't as bad as described by a federal study and by
Bush administration officials.
   Linda Chavez, who served at the U.S. Civil Rights Commission
during the Reagan administration, provoked strong disagreement with
her testimony at a hearing on Hispanic children Monday by the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   She disputed remarks Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos made last
week when he released a report on school dropouts and said the rate
among Hispanic students is ``a national tragedy.''
   ``The future looks quite good for individual Hispanics,'' said
Chavez.
   ``Native-born Hispanics, despite the ominous report from the
Department of Education, appear to be staying in school longer,''
she said.
   She challenged the statistical basis for the report and said the
department's finding, like other statistical studies of Hispanics,
were skewed by large influxes of recent immigrants _ arriving at a
rate she estimated at 400,000 a year.
   Chavez said Hispanic immigrants will eventually move into the
economic mainstream as have earlier European immigrants, who also
faced high dropout rates in their first generations.
   The studies ``diminish the very real and significant progress''
of Hispanics in this country.
   Her remarks put her at odds, however, with a panel of Hispanic
experts appearing with her before the committee, who cited severe
poverty and education problems among Hispanics.
   ``She's not right,'' said Ann Rosewater, staff director of the
committee, following the hearing. ``They (other expert witnesses)
made a very clear point. There's lots of research showing not just
first generation, but second and third generation (Hispanics) are
not doing well in school.''
   Raul Hinojosa of the University of California at Berkeley said
Hispanics of varying national origins are falling further behind
economically. He said Hispanics have been hurt by discrimination,
low educational achievement and changes in the national labor
market that have reduced the availability of middle-income jobs.
   He said the higher fertility rate among Hispanics is a more
important factor than the arrival of recent immigrants.
   Committee Chairman George Miller, D-Calif., said Hispanics face
``severe poverty'' and ``incredible disparity'' with other ethnic
groups, regardless of the statistics used.
   ``The numbers are overwhelming,'' he said.
   Chavez is a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute for
Policy Research, a conservative New York research organization, and
is a former unsuccessful Republican candidate for the Senate from
Maryland.

<HEAD>Some Sixth Graders Use Cocaine Every Week, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some sixth-graders say they use cocaine as
often as every week, according to a survey released today that
shows an ``alarming trend'' of drug use among junior high school
students.
   At the same time, illicit use of drugs and alcohol declined
among high school students, according to the nonscientific survey
of almost 400,000 secondary school students by the National
Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
   ``Whereas we have seen some drops (in drug use) at the upper
grades, at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more
use,'' said Doug Hall, vice president of PRIDE.
   Dr. Thomas J. Gleaton, Jr., president of the Atlanta-based drug
prevention organization that has been conducting the nationwide
surveys since 1982, said the study ``detected weekly cocaine use in
the sixth grade.''
   Of the 29,116 sixth-graders who responded to the question about
cocaine use, about 233 said they used cocaine weekly or daily,
according to the report. About 58 sixth-graders said they used
cocaine once or twice a month, and another 87 sixth-graders said
they used cocaine one to six times a year, the survey found.
   The survey covered 392,003 students in grades 6 to 12 who
answered the anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38
states, according to PRIDE.
   Overall for junior high students, of the 161,907 who responded
to the question on cocaine use, 0.7 percent or 1,133 said they used
it weekly or daily; an equal number used it infrequently and 648
said they used it once or twice a month.
   The study showed 24.9 percent of junior high school students
said they had drunk an alcoholic beverage this year. Two years ago
26.3 percent said they had done so, and in 1984-85, 21.2 percent
said they had.
   In senior high school grades _ 9-12 _ the use of cocaine,
marijuana, beer and liquor declined from the levels of two and four
years ago, the study found.
   A total of 4.6 percent of the 223,036 students in grades 9-12
who responded to the question on cocaine use said they used the
drug this year, compared with 5.7 percent four years ago and 6.4
percent two years ago, the PRIDE survey found. Of the 10,260 this
year who said they used cocaine, 2,900 said they used it weekly or
daily, according to the report.
   The National High School Seniors Survey, released in February,
also found that drug abuse among high school seniors declined last
year, reaching its lowest level since 1975. That survey by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research found that
the proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once in
their lifetime dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in
1988.
   Gleaton said only 22 percent of the senior class of 1989 was
drug-free, with the other 78 percent saying they had used a drug or
alcoholic beverage in the previous year.
   ``It is a matter of grave concern to the nation that thousands
of young and promising brains are being impaired daily,'' said Dr.
Gabriel G. Nahas of Columbia University's College of Physicians and
Surgeons, who is PRIDE's medical advisor.
   Cigarette smoking, while not considered a drug by PRIDE, gained
popularity in all the grades surveyed, with 38.7 percent of high
school students and 28.1 percent of junior high school students
saying they had smoked a cigarette, increases over both two and
four years ago.
   Extrapolating from the survey, PRIDE estimated that 690,000
American students in grades 6-12 tried cocaine last year and about
223,000 used cocaine weekly or daily. PRIDE did not provide a
margin of error for this estimate, however.

   President Bush's chemical weapons proposal
might play in Moscow but his call for a global ban is not likely to
get much of a hearing in Libya and Iran, which are thought to
possess the grisly substances, experts say.
   Addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Monday, Bush
proclaimed readiness to destroy 80 percent of U.S. chemical weapons
if Moscow follows suit, and urged other nations to sign a
multilateral pact to outlaw them entirely.
   Bush's proposal ``made virtue of necessity,'' said one senior
senator, because in 1985 Congress passed a law requiring the
destruction of all old chemical weapons by 1997, while authorizing
production of a new generation.
   ``I consider it a good, positive move,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``Getting
the Soviets to join in would be very good, and if both superpowers
lead the way bilaterally, I think it will give some impetus to the
overall world move in that direction _ which is the ultimate
objective.''
   The United States and Soviet Union are the only two states to
acknowledge having chemical weapons, although Bush said that as
many as 20 nations possess or have the capability of producing them.
   Experts have estimated up to a dozen nations can make chemical
weapons. There was no explanation from the White House for the
figure of 20 Bush used.
   Delegates to the 40-Nation Conference on Disarmament ended their
most recent meeting in Geneva last month without any indication of
an agreement on a chemical weapons ban.
   The conference, which meets again in November, is stalled on the
issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons, which
experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make
fertilizer or other compounds.
   Also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles, and
even the number of countries that have them.
   The extent of the U.S. stockpile is classified, although private
analysts estimate it at 30,000 tons. Soviet spokesman said their
government had ``no more than 50,000 tons of chemical warfare
agents.''
   It may take more than a superpower deal, however, to provide rid
the planet of chemical weapons, according to two private arms
control experts in Washington.
   Bush's proposal ``might focus international attention on
chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty,'' said Lee
Feinstein of the Arms Control Association, a disarmament lobby in
Washington.
   But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet agreement and divert
attention from production by other countries, he said.
   Elisa D. Harris of the Brookings Institution in Washington,
called Bush's call ``a pretty disappointing response from a
president who has committed himself to eliminating chemical weapons
from the face of the Earth.''
   She said it was unlikely to win the support of Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, who U.S. intelligence accuses of trying to build a
chemical weapons plant. Gadhafi has said the plant is for
pharmaceuticals.
   ``We are giving the Gadhafis of the world a veto power. We are
saying that we will not implement the treaties until the Gadhafis
agree to it,'' said Harris.
   Other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons
are Burma, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria,
Taiwan and probably Egypt, she said.
   Other uncertainties surrounded Bush's proposal.
   ``There are questions whether the proposal would require the
United States to destroy any of the binary weapons that it is now
producing,'' said Feinstein.
   In 1987, the United States ended an 18-year moratorium on the
making of chemical weapons, but the current and planned level of
binary production is classified.
   Bush did not announce an end to production of the new generation
of binary chemical weapons, in which two toxic chemicals mix to
form a lethal chemical.
   Since the size of the U.S. stockpile is secret, it was not clear
exactly how many weapons Bush was proposing to destroy.
   The U.S. government has already started destroying its old
chemical weapons.
   The Soviet Union suspended chemical weapon production on Dec.
26, 1987, seven months after the U.S. resumed production, and they
said their stockpile consisted of the nerve agents Sarin, Soman,
VX, two mustard blistering agents, and one irritant. They have said
they will destroy some chemical weapons, but not spelled out how
many.

   A couple suffering from cerebral palsy were
killed when the electric blanket on their waterbed caught fire and
they were unable to escape their apartment, according to police.
   Donald and Loral Roser, both 44, were trapped as the fire spread
early Monday through their apartment in a self-care facility for
about 150 elderly and handicapped people, said Lt. Michael Reilly,
spokesman for the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department.
   Investigators say the blanket may have been improperly tucked
under the couple's waterbed on one of fall's first cool nights,
said Reilly.
   Because of their cerebral palsy, the couple, who were married
for three years, needed wheelchairs to run errands and used canes
in their home. They appeared to have been overcome by heavy smoke
before they could flee the apartment, fire officials said.
   Residents of Lockwood House live in apartments structured for
their needs. In addition to smoke detectors, each unit is equipped
with emergency cords in the bedrooms and bathrooms that make an
electrical panel at the front desk light up and buzz, said Nevine
Lowe, a district manager for the company.
   A desk clerk heard the emergency buzzer about 1:30 a.m. Monday,
but found thick smoke when he want to the apartment after summoning
the fire department, said Reilly.
   Roser apparently was fatally overcome as he pulled an emergency
cord, fire officials said.

<HEAD>Gallery Officials Want to Quiet Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board which runs the city's oldest art
museum is trying to come up with a plan to defuse a controversy
over the cancellation of an exhibit which contained sexually
explicit photographs.
   However, the Corcoran Gallery of Art trustees reaffirmed their
support Monday for Christina Orr-Cahall, the museum's director, who
made the cancellation decision.
   The Corcoran has been criticized for three months in the wake of
Ms. Orr-Cahall's cancellation of an exhibition of Robert
Mapplethorpe photographs. The cancellation was made with the
consent of the Corcoran's board of trustees.
   The exhibit included sexually explicit and homoerotic
photographs and pictures of nude children, which drew protests from
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other conservative members of
Congress.
   At a regularly scheduled meeting Monday, the Corcoran board
agreed to appoint a special panel of trustees to examine the
three-month controversy and recommend steps to defuse it.

<HEAD>Drug Suspect Held in Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Department officials say they are
likely to seek the extradition of an accused drug trafficker
arrested in Colombia last weekend.
   Carlos Humberto Gomez-Zapata was picked up by the Colombian Army
as part of that nation's crackdown on drug lords, Justice
Department officials said Monday.
   Gomez-Zapata was indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida in
1984. The indictment alleges that Gomez-Zapata led a drug ring that
shipped tons of methaqualone from West Germany and Austria through
Panama to Colombia, where it was then transported illegally into
the United States. The drug is also known as Quaaludes, a hypnotic
depressant that was believed by users to enhance sexual pleasure.
   The indictment was one of four returned by a federal grand jury
as a result of DEA's ``Operation Hammerhead,'' which the Justice
Department said identified 24 shipments of methaqualone pills and
powder totalling 54 tons of illegal drugs bound for this country.

<UNK>Hinckley Letter Blames Jews</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential assailant John Hinckley says he
is Adolf Hitler's successor and he thinks Jews are ``the cause of
most of the world's problems.''
   Hinckley outlined his views in letters written in 1985 and 1986
and read Monday at a court hearing.
   The letters were introduced by District of Columbia lawyers who
oppose Hinckley's request to be interviewed by reporters. Dr.
Raymond Patterson, a forensic psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths
Hospital where Hinckley is confined, testified that Hinckley is
severely mentally ill.
   In a Sept. 9, 1985 letter, Hinckley wrote that he heads a
movement which he said ``has blacks and whites and everyone else
except Jews because I have a theory that they are the cause of most
of the world's problems and they are all Antichrists.''
   U.S. District Court Judge June Green is considering Hinckley's
request to conduct up to two interviews a month with reporters.
   Hinckley has been in St. Elizabeths ever since he was found
innocent by reason of insanity of attempting to kill President
Reagan in 1981. Reagan was wounded in the attack.

   A man under investigation in the Green River
serial killings will be transferred to federal custody in Spokane
to face charges he possessed a firearm while a fugitive, a
magistrate ordered.
   Police, meanwhile, disclosed that William Jay Stevens II talked
for the first time with Green River Task Force, which is
investigating the slayings of up to 48 young women in the Northwest
from 1982-84.
   The interview failed to clear up a number of investigators'
questions, said King County police Capt. Robert Evans, who heads
the task force.
   On Monday, Stevens completed a sentence at the King County jail.
He had been jailed there since his January arrest in Spokane for
escaping from a work-release facility while serving a term for
burglary in 1981.
   During a hearing Monday before U.S. Magistrate John L. Weinberg,
the 38-year-old Stevens agreed to the transfer to Spokane. If
convicted on the firearms count, he could be sentenced to 10 years
in prison and fined $250,000, said Susan Dohrmann, assistant U.S.
attorney.
   The Green River Task Force has characterized Stevens as a
``viable suspect'' in its investigation into the deaths of 40 women
and the disappearances of eight others.
   The description was contained in an affidavit filed to support a
search of two Spokane residences where Stevens lived while
attending Gonzaga University's School of Law.
   No charges related to the killings have been filed against
Stevens, who has denied he is the killer.
   Late last week, Evans said his officers needed two more weeks to
finish evaluating their information on Stevens.
   ``The decision would be to determine whether this person is a
murder suspect or merely a victim of some bizarre circumstances,''
said Evans.
   The Green River slayings take their name from the south King
County river where the first victims were discovered.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Ponder Use Of Franklin Bequests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benjamin Franklin once implored a young
tradesman to ``remember that time is money.'' Time, in a curious
way, has given a new twist to his advice.
   Franklin, apparently willing to test whether a penny saved is a
penny earned, left bequests to the cities of Boston and
Philadelphia _ 1,000 pounds sterling each.
   In the nearly 200 years since his death April 17, 1790, the
money has grown in trusts to millions of dollars.
   When the 200th anniversary of his death arrives, state and city
officials _ in accordance with his will _ will decide what to do
with the money.
   In Boston and Philadelphia, the prospect has started people
thinking.
   ``Rather than just see it go to Ben Franklin museum, we should
try to be more creative,'' said state Sen. Vincent Fumo, a
Philadelphia Democrat who is shopping around for worthy causes. He
referred to the Franklin Institute, a science museum in
Philadelphia.
   ``I think it should be something symbolic of Ben Franklin,''
Fumo added, noting that the city's bequest had grown to $2 million
in a Philadelphia trust.
   In Boston, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn also is looking for ``creative
solutions,'' said his spokesman, Mike Lynch. The Boston share, also
administered in a trust, has grown to about $4 million, Lynch said.
   At the 100th anniversary of Franklin's death, some of the money
was designated for public works in both cities, a request made in
the will. On the 200th anniversary, Franklin specified that the
money should be divided between state and city governments, with
about three-quarters going to the states and one-quarter to the
cities.
   That would give the state of Pennsylvania about $1.5 million and
Philadelphia $500,000. Massachusetts could receive $3 million and
Boston $1 million.
   But it's unclear how the money will be used. There are ideas,
but no plans have been approved.
   Fumo said he has been asked to consider using the money for an
arts fund, but wants the state to weigh as many options as
possible. As a starting point, he has introduced legislation to
give the state's share to the Franklin Institute.
   In Boston, officials have been reviewing the issue for about two
years, said Robert Fleming, executive secretary for the city's
trust office. He said a recommendation was expected next year.
   Franklin asked that the money be used to help young
``artificers,'' meaning craftsmen or inventors, and in a way,
that's what it's been doing in the hands of the trusts.
   In Philadelphia, much of the money is invested in mortgages. In
Boston, the bulk of the money has been used for loans to medical
students.
   Fleming said there is interest in continuing to use the money
for student loans.
   ``He really understood the value of thinking for the future,''
Fleming said of the inventor, philosopher and statesman. ``He
really had a lot of faith in this county. He wanted to help those
who helped him.''

   Christina and James Kimball scrapped
their honeymoon dream in Puerto Rico last week as Hurricane Hugo
bore down on the island. Instead, they went to a beachfront
condominium. In South Carolina.
   The condominium was on the Isle of Palms off Charleston _ the
bulls-eye of Hugo's first strike on the U.S. mainland.
   ``I'm just going to remember it as basically a nightmare,'' the
bride said Monday after the couple returned to Springfield.
   Chased from the resort island by evacuation orders, the couple
rode out the storm Thursday night in the bathtub of a Charleston
motel. They then fled the devastated city, driving home non-stop to
arrive Sunday.
   The condo, 100 feet from the beach, was flooded by Hugo's
17-foot surge. The Kimballs managed to get to Charleston in time to
escape harm, and as the wind picked up, huddled in the motel room,
listening as the tar and gravel roof began tearing off.
   ``You couldn't open your door because of the wind pressure,''
said Mrs. Kimball. ``Then, our window smashed open and we ran into
the bathroom with all our stuff. Jamie kept running back into the
room to get everything, but we finally sat in the bathtub with a
candle and the champagne for about an hour.
   ``All you could hear was glass breaking and windows going,''
said the bride, a package store clerk and community college
student. ``Then, the eye of the storm came over about 1:30 a.m.,
and everyone came out of their rooms.''
   Their car was one of the two left undamaged in the motel parking
lot.
   The Kimballs never considered a U.S. landfall for Hugo in making
their plans.
   Said the bride: ``We thought this would be a cheap honeymoon.''

<TEXT>
   Two books printed by Benjamin Franklin and
worth as much as $60,000 have been stolen from the University of
Pennsylvania Library.
   One of the books is a 1744 catalogue Franklin made to advertise
second-hand and imported books he wanted to sell, said Daniel
Traister, assistant director of libraries. The volume, ``A
Catalogue of Books to be Sold,'' is the only one known to exist and
is worth $25,000 to $50,000, Traister said Monday.
   The other, which Traister said is worth at least $10,000,
consists of two 1751 essays bound together: Richard Peters' ``A
Sermon on Education'' printed in Philadelphia by Franklin and D.
Hall, and Franklin's essay called `Idea of the English School.''
   The books have been missing since Aug. 16, when a library patron
using the name Greg Williams and giving a New York address checked
them out to study in the library's rare book reading room. The
theft was discovered Friday and reported to police, Traister said.
   Investigators haven't figured out how the thief got away, and
aren't sure if he gave his real name, Traister said, adding that
both volumes are small and easily hidden.
   Directory assistance listings in the New York City area don't
have a number for Greg Williams at the address given.

   An accident at a construction site left
three men dead and three others hospitalized for burns suffered
when a scaffolding came in contact with power lines carrying enough
electricity to supply a small town.
   The men were moving the 25-foot scaffolding Monday when it
struck lines carrying 69,000 volts, said Doug Reardon, president of
Target Construction Co., the general contractor. No one was on the
scaffolding.
   ``It appears to me a bunch of guys were pushing the scaffold
from one job site to another and just didn't look up. They never
knew what hit them,'' said police Sgt. Clifford Davis.
   The workers were putting up aluminum siding on the building,
which is to be a distribution center for Worthington Industries Inc.
   Authorities identified the dead as Greg Donahue, 34, J.H.
Claytor, 31, and Terry L. Titus, 38.
   Thomas Moore, 39, was in critical condition Monday night after
surgery for second- and third-degree burns at the Ohio State
University Hospital.
   Willard Tackett, 39, was in critical condition at St. Ann's
Hospital in surburban Westerville. Jeff Grabill, 26, was listed in
fair condition Monday night at Riverside Hospital with extensive
burns to his left hand.
   The deaths were being investigated as an industrial accident,
police said. Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
officials also were investigating. Regional Director George Kunz
said it would be at least a week before his office could determine
if there were any violations.
   Officials at Columbus Southern Power Co. said the cable carried
enough electricity to supply a small town. The line primarily fed
Worthington Industries' specialty steel-making plant and was one of
two circuits serving an Anheuser-Busch brewery.
   Ray Smith of Scioto-Darby Concrete Co., which was pouring the
concrete floor to the building, said he was inside the building
when he heard an explosion and saw ``a huge orange ball of fire
shooting way up in the sky.''
   Worthington Industries was without power for about five hours
and sent 200 employees home, said spokesman Bruce Ruhl.

   Residents who got their first look at
the devastation wrought by Hurricane Hugo say it will be years
before this barrier island returns to being a quaint seaside
village.
   ``On a normal day, this was like being in heaven,'' said Paul
Traywick, whose first floor was buried under an inch of muck.
   ``It's not like that any more,'' Traywick said. ``Not for a long
time.''
   The island, heavily damaged by wind and water and cut off from
the mainland because of a downed bridge, was declared under martial
law.
   Island officials on Monday began a daily ferry service allowing
some residents to return home for a few hours.
   Hugo's 135 mph winds bashed the island, located across the
harbor from Charleston, and a wall of water swept through homes and
businesses.
   Few houses were left undamaged, most of the taller trees were
felled and huge potholes were scooped out of the roads. The beach
has shifted, and the entire marina dock was torn loose from its
pilings and swept to nearby Goat Island.
   ``It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said
resident Tom Harper, a retired Air Force officer who served in
Europe during World War II.
   For many residents, angry at what they consider government
inaction in getting them on the island, it was a relief to see what
Hugo had wrought.
   ``I'm glad to know what the situation is,'' said Traywick. ``At
least I know. Now we can sit down and get started on some plans.''
   For John Bozzelli, it wouldn't have made much difference when he
got to the island. His house, now split open like an overripe
melon, is about 50 yards from where it was last week.
   ``I pretty well figured it might be gone,'' he said.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work Monday on a
temporary pontoon bridge linking Isle of Palms, and adjacent
Sullivan's Island, to the mainland. Isle of Palms City Councilman
Harry O'Neal said that should give most residents of the islands
land access by week's end.
   Monday afternoon, Army barges transported bulldozers to the
island to clear the fallen trees.
   Most residents said they would return to rebuild, even with the
first-hand knowledge of what a powerful hurricane can do.
   ``I think most people will be back,'' said Muriel Metz, who owns
a house and a rental duplex on the island. ``It's like an
addiction, the laid-back style and the quiet.''
   Al Collins, manager of the Sea Cabins development that once
existed on the beach, said the cabins would be rebuilt.
   ``It's the tranquillity of the island when it's not under a
storm seige,'' Collins said. ``It'll be back to that one of these
days.''

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
sharply to end at yet another high Tuesday, and the dollar ended
slightly lower against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 484.11 points, or 1.38
percent, the second-largest one-day gain this year, ending the day
at 35,444.82. It gained 188.92 points Monday.
   This year's largest one-day advance, 793.96 points, was recorded
March 28.
   The dollar closed at 142.80 yen, down 0.15 yen from Monday's
close of 142.95 yen. It opened lower at 142.25 yen and ranged
between 142.10 yen and 143.15 yen.
   The U.S. currency's low opening followed its overnight plunge
overseas after coordinated dollar-selling interventions, including
actions by the central banks of the United States and Japan,
traders said.
   The currency finished at 142.13 yen in New York on Monday,
almost four yen lower than Friday's 146.05-yen close.
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries agreed in Washington on Saturday that they
will closely cooperate in foreign exchange markets to stem the
dollar's strength.
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said the
dollar inched up in the morning when quite a few dollar-buying
orders against the West German mark came from Singapore, but later
trading was mixed as participants made position adjustments.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the Bank of Japan intervened intermittently
and sold small amount of dollars to halt a new upswing, but the
amount of selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on
its monetary actions.
   ``For a while, the dollar is unlikely to rise back much, because
the G-7 central banks will coordinate intervention actively,'' Ms.
Takeuchi added.
   On the stock exchange, ``The Nikkei seems to have entered its
uptrend finally,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a stock analyst with
Nomura Securities.
   He attributed the index's consistent rise to the yen's rebound
against the dollar following the G-7 monetary talks.

<HEAD>Jiang Denies Suppression Of Pro-Democracy Movement A Tragedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin today denied
that the military suppression of the pro-democracy movement was a
tragedy, calling the assault an unavoidable response to an attempt
to overthrow the government.
   Jiang, in his first news conference since being named to head
the 48-million member party in June, also indicated that the party
had yet to decide whether Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader,
will be allowed to retire from his last official post.
   Jiang was joined by the other five members of the Politburo
Standing Committee, the ruling party's top decision-making group,
including conservative Premier Li Peng.
   Some 400 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the conference,
which was broadcast live on national television.
   Jiang, a former party boss in Shanghai who replaced the ousted
reformist Zhao Ziyang on June 24, said of the June clash between
pro-democracy protesters and the army: ``We believe it was not a
tragedy.''
   He called the pro-democracy movement a ``counter-revolutionary
rebellion aimed at negating the leadership of the Communist Party
of China and overthrowing the socialist system.''
   The June 3-4 military attack on student-led protesters in
central Beijing was unavoidable, he said, because of foreign forces
trying to undermine China's socialist system and a handful of
people within China who ``engaged in all kinds of conspiracies in
an attempt to overthrow the existing government.''
   The army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the assault.
   Jiang, 63, who reportedly has been named by Deng to succeed him
as top leader when he leaves the political scene, said ``much is at
stake'' in the question of when the 85-year-old Deng should leave
his last post, as chairman of the Central Military Commission.
   He noted that Deng had on numerous occasions expressed a wish to
pass on power to a new generation, but it was still up to the party
and state to decide when the architect of China's past decade of
economic reforms can step down.
   Jiang did not mention a party decision, revealed in May by Zhao,
to continue accepting Deng's leadership on major issues regardless
of his formal resignation from all but the military post.
   Deng's resignation from that post would not be likely to alter
his position as the final arbiter of political matters, but would
reflect his efforts to put in place successors he trusts.
   Jiang acknowledged that the party Central Committee, which could
make a formal ruling on Deng's retirement, will be meeting soon to
map out economic development plans for the next two or three years.
   Jiang and the others refused to answer repeated questions on the
number of people arrested and executed in the crackdown on dissent.
   Qiao Shi, who is responsible for legal matters within the party,
said ``we have dealt with some people'' but all those executed were
convicted of serious crimes. He said China has acted prudently
toward students and intellectuals and called a foreign report of
120,000 arrests since June ``unfounded nonsense.''
   Jiang, told by a reporter that a woman student had been sent to
the countryside after participating in the pro-democracy movement
and been raped there by peasants, described the case as ``a fairy
tale out of The Arabian Nights.''
   He stressed that China's policy toward students who demanded
democratic reform was ``to unite them and educate them.''
   Since taking office Jiang has pressed for greater attention to
ideological matters, particularly among young people.
   He indicated that in this way he could escape the fate of his
two predecessors, Zhao and the late Hu Yaobang. Both were purged
for failing to combat Western liberal ideas while trying to open
China up to the world.
   Jiang declined to say what will happen to Zhao. He said the
party was ``making further investigations'' into charges Zhao
supported the pro-democracy movement and thus split the party.
   Both Jiang and Li, Zhao's rival for power, blamed Zhao for
letting the political unrest get out of hand, but Jiang's tone
indicated Zhao may escape criminal charges.
   Jiang said the party recognized that Zhao had done some positive
things in his nine years as premier and party general secretary.
   Zhao, who has not been seen in public since he went to central
Tiananmen Square on May 19 to talk to student hunger strikers, is
leading a ``quiet and comfortable life,'' Jiang said.
   Jiang added that since Zhao had served the party longer than he
had: ``He enjoys better treatment, in fact he enjoys a better
salary than me.''
   On other topics, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, who heads the State
Planning Commission, reiterated that China will stick to such
economic reforms as developing export-oriented industries along the
coast.
   He said private enterprise would continue to play a ``necessary
and beneficial supplemental role'' in the socialist economy but
added that ``appropriate restrictions'' would check the growth of
private industry.
   Premier Li spoke at length on corruption, a major issue during
the spring protests, saying the party was taking the lead by
cracking down on nepotism, use of luxury imported cars, overseas

<HEAD>Poll: Americans Believe Bush Will Ask Congress to Raise Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of four Americans believe President Bush
will ask Congress for a tax increase despite his campaign pledge
that he would not raise taxes, according to a poll published today.
   The New York Times-CBS News poll also found resounding approval
for the way Bush is handling his job.
   The poll found that 73 percent believe Bush will request a tax
increase during the next four years. The percent finding is the
same as in a Times-CBS poll in January.
   The poll indicated that 69 percent of the public generally
approves of Bush's job performance and 18 percent disapproves.
   The poll also indicated that:
   _79 percent believe Bush will be able to maintain good relations
with the Soviet Union.
   _51 percent think Bush will not reduce the drug problem
significantly.
   _54 percent think the environment will not improve significantly.
   _57 percent believe he will improve education.
   The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,347 adults
nationwide from Sept. 17 to Sept. 20, had margin of error of plus
or minus 3 points.
   While most of the poll was good news for the president, the same
was not true for Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Only 13 percent had a favorable view of Quayle, with 19 percent
had an unfavorable opinion of him. About 45 percent said they knew
too little about Quayle to form an opinion about him.

<HEAD>Zookeepers Meet as Animal Matchmakers</HEAD>

   He's got dark legs, closely cropped hair, and
is about 4-feet-8. And, at the behest of a group of matchmakers, he
recently flew from San Diego to Memphis to ease the loss of two
widowed mares.
   He's an Asian wild horse, otherwise known as Przewalski's horse,
and his mission is to be fruitful and multiply, especially now that
his kind are extinct in the wild.
   Where he goes and with whom he breeds is up to a group of about
1,000 zoologists meeting at a downtown hotel this week to determine
the fate of more than 7,000 animals from 50 endangered species kept
in North American zoos and aquariums.
   What happens then is up to Mother Nature.
   ``We recognize that we can make a genetic plan, but we're
dealing with individual animals and they don't always read the
books we do. But so far, he's showing the right interests,'' Oliver
Ryder of the San Diego Zoo said Monday.
   Ryder oversees the captive breeding of Przewalski's horses
through the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums,
an umbrella organization of 140 institutions in North America.
   The organization is trying to rescue animals from extinction by
breeding them in captivity with the hopes of eventually
reintroducing them to the wild.
   ``Zoos can't hope to save everything. They can only hope to save
a small portion of the species of the world,'' said Dennis Meritt
Jr., a board member of the association and assistant director of
the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.
   ``It's better than not having anything,'' said Jack Grisham, of
the Oklahoma City Zoo, who oversees the nationwide breeding of
cheetahs.
   ``Remember the bison. Back at the turn of the century, there was
just a handful and the New York Zoological Society took them to the
Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma and they started breeding again.
They're the basis of all the bison in North America,'' Grisham said.
   But problems remain.
   ``Any place in the world today there's a problem with finding
space for wild animals,'' said Ryder. ``Whether they continue to
exist is completely up to one species _ us. It's our decision
whether we make the space and provide them with protection to
survive. It's up to us. Do nothing, and they're gone.''
   The association counts several successes among its special
survival plans.
   Only about 50 Bali mynah birds remain in the wild, but American
zoos have been so successful in breeding them that several hundred
are expected to be released into the rain forests of Bali in coming
years, Meritt said.
   There are no known free-ranging Arabian oryx, a type of antelope
once found on the Arabian peninsula. But thanks to captive
breeding, the oryx is being returned to the desert, Meritt said.
   Tom Foose, association coordinator of the species survival plans
for all the zoos, said zookeepers want to spread animal genes
around different zoos to avoid sterility, mutations and other
problems in breeding.
   ``Our objective is to stop evolution and preserve as much as the
gene pool as we can get these animals back in the wild and let
natural selection sort it all out again,'' Foose said.

   Congressional investigators say that almost a
year after a Pan Am jet exploded over Scotland, the Federal
Aviation Administration can't say that its promised tighter
security precautions are in place.
   Airlines are not meeting their security requirements and the
training of security workers appears to be the biggest problem,
according to a General Accounting Office report that was summarized
Monday by a congresswoman.
   ``FAA has not established minimum training standards needed to
ensure that airline security personnel working at high risk
airports overseas are sufficiently trained to carry out required
security measures,'' Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., quoted GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, as saying.
   Collins said the full report would remain secret, but she said
investigators found the FAA ``cannot assure itself that required
security procedures are being properly carried out by the airlines
at designated high-risk airports.''
   Airlines are responsible for security at airport gates,
generally using guidelines set by the FAA.
   The airports considered high-risk for Americans were identified
during the hearing as those in Europe and the Middle East.
   Two hundred seventy people died when Pan Am Flight 103, which
started in Frankfurt, West Germany and stopped in London, blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21. Investigators found the
mid-air explosion was caused by a bomb in a radio cassette player.
   The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command is considered the prime suspect behind
the act, though the group's leader has denied involvement.
   Witnesses told the hearing of the House Government Operations
government activities and transportation subcommittee, which
Collins chairs, that intelligence about anti-American groups likely
to attack airlines isn't good enough.
   ``Security begins with an understanding of the threat it faces;
our intelligence services must provide this understanding,'' said
Noel Koch, former Defense Department expert on terrorism, now
president of International Security Management, Inc.
   ``They don't do it especially well, and it isn't especially easy
to do,'' he said. ``The FAA should have an independent intelligence
capability.''
   Edward Cunningham, managing director of corporate security of
Pan American World Airways Inc., said the government should take
more responsibility for combatting travel dangers and should share
some intelligence with airlines.
   ``Information like the types of passports these groups are
using,'' Cunningham said. ``When information is floating around
that a group is planning something, we should be told.''
   Pan Am was fined recently for alleged security lapses at
Heathrow Airport and Frankfort's airport, including failure to
properly screen passengers, improperly checking some carry-on
baggage and failure to search cargo areas before loading.
   About a dozen members of two organizations of family members of
passengers on Flight 103 also told the congressional panel the
government should get tougher on security.
   ``Placing responsibility for security procedures in the hands of
airlines is a conflict of interest,'' said testimony prepared by
the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103. ``Airlines are in the business to
make money. Precious dollars are cut from vital security budgets to
raise bottom-line profits.''

   Showers soaked parts of the Northeast today, causing authorities
to warn of flooding in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, while a cold
front in the north-central United States dropped temperatures to
near freezing.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms dumped rain Monday from
Mississippi to the southern half of the Atlantic Coast. One
thunderstorm along the coast of North Carolina spawned a tornado
near the town of Seaside.
   More than 2{ inches of rain fell at New Bern, N.C., and more
than 1{ inches fell at Cherry Point, N.C.
   The showers and thunderstorms spread to the Northeast early
today. Small stream and urban flood watches were posted for much of
southern New Jersey and east-central Pennsylvania, where up to 3
inches of rain were possible.
   Clouds and rain kept temperatures in the 50s and 60s over much
of the Southeast on Monday.
   Strong northwesterly winds ushered more cold air into the
central part of the country. A gale warning was in effect for Lake
Huron, and frost and freeze advisories were posted overnight for
northwest Wisconsin.
   Record high temperatures on Monday included Pocatello, Idaho,
which registered 89 degrees, and Tucson, Ariz., with 103 degrees.

   A judge ordered former Temptations lead singer
David Ruffin to jail because he showed up five hours late for a
hearing.
   Ruffin, who was in court on a probation violation charge, was
scheduled for a 9 a.m. hearing Monday before Judge John O'Brien.
   When Ruffin arrived just before 2 p.m., O'Brien ordered Ruffin
to spend the night in jail and said the court would take up the
matter today.
   ``It would look better if he had shown up on time, but there's
hope,'' said Ruffin's attorney, Jeff Collins.
   Monday's hearing was scheduled to decide if Ruffin should
undergo drug treatment instead of serving a jail sentence.
   Ruffin, 48, was convicted in May 1988 of misdemeanor possession
of cocaine. His sentence included two years' probation, 50 days of
community service and drug testing and treatment.
   A drug test last week was positive for opiates, Collins said.
Ruffin was arrested Sept. 16, the third time this year he has been
in court for probation violations.
   Last week, Ruffin denied he had a drug problem, then admitted it
later.
   The judge had postponed deciding Ruffin's case until Monday, so
Collins could check into the price and availability of a
drug-treatment center in New York City.

   Eleven British and Australian mercenaries,
experts in assassination and explosives, spent three months in
Colombia schooling private soldiers of cocaine barons in
sophisticated weaponry, NBC News reported.
   The network, on ``NBC Nightly News'' Monday, broadcast videotape
of what it said were the highly paid mercenaries training the drug
troops and later counting their $20,000 pay _ delivered in American
ten-dollar bills _ in a Bogota hotel room.
   The footage was taken by one of the mercenaries, Australian
Terry Tagney, and smuggled out out of Colombia, NBC correspondent
Brian Ross reported. He did not say when it was taken.
   Ross gave no further details about Tagney, who said in an
interview that he and the other men were told they were going to
Colombia to help fight communist guerrillas but soon realized they
were working for the drug bosses.
   Ross said that when Colombian police came looking for the
mercenaries they were able to escape on a cargo plane provided to
the drug bosses by Colombia's military. He quoted Tagney as saying
the mercenaries had been protected everywhere they went by
Colombian military and police officials.
   The tape showed what it said were prostitutes being delivered
for a night with the mercenaries at an island on a small river in
Colombia that the drug bosses called ``Fantasy Island.''
   The government has since confiscated the island.
   The mercenaries, led by a former British special forces sergeant
major, were shown teaching classes in how to fire a rifle grenade
launcher and how to set up grenade booby traps at cocaine
processing labs to stop drug agents, according to the tape.
   NBC News paid Tagney for his videotape, said an NBC spokeswoman,
Katherine McQuay. She declined to say how much.
   The network on Aug. 21 broadcast video footage of what it said
were Israelis teaching the drug soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Benjamin Ward, the city's first black police
commissioner, has resigned after almost six years, leaving a legacy
of innovation despite budget constraints, a tough war on drugs and
his own verbal gaffes.
   ``I'm not always right,'' Ward once said, ``but I'm never dull.''
   Ward, 63, cited chronic asthma in a resignation letter sent
Monday to Mayor Edward I. Koch. His departure is effective Oct. 22.
   During Ward's time in office, crime rates soared and city
streets got more violent, fueled by crack.
   Ward said combating the drug war was his ``highest priority from
the start,'' noting that the Narcotics Division grew almost
five-fold during his term, which began Jan. 1, 1984. He also
created Tactical Narcotics Teams that are deployed to crack-ridden
neighborhoods.
   But, Ward added in his letter, ``I must acknowledge that the
greatest problem when I came in is even more serious as I depart.
... The plague of illegal drugs that has wreaked such tragedy,
violence and crime.''
   Koch, who called Ward ``one of the greatest police commissioners
that ever served,'' appointed First Deputy Commissioner Richard J.
Condon _ Ward's own choice _ as commissioner.
   Koch, who lost his bid for re-election in September's Democratic
primary to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, leaves office
at the end of the year.
   Koch said Ward indicated before the primary that he wanted to
resign but waited at the mayor's request. He said Ward would return
to private life, but would not elaborate.
   Ward has been working since June on his memoirs, tentatively
titled ``Cop,'' to be published next fall.
   Ward ran afoul of some black groups in July 1987 when he called
black crime against blacks ``our little dirty secret.''
   The next month, he apologized publicly for saying to a woman who
spoke at a town meeting about being afraid of rapists: ``You're out
here tonight. You can't be too frightened. You're the kind he's
looking for, under 30, beautiful, blonde.''
   In apologizing for what he called that ``insensitive'' remark,
Ward said the woman had been heckling him and that he had taken
asthma medication that ``may hype me up.''
   Ward joined the force in 1951 as the first black police officer
in a Brooklyn precinct.
   ``I think they were surprised to see me,'' he recalled in 1984.
``I had an Irish name, and I came from a predominantly white
veterans' housing project in Bath Beach, but when they saw me, they
developed a sudden shortage of lockers at the precinct house.''
   By the time he was through, the positions he held included
detective, head of the internal legal department, commissioner for
community affairs, city traffic commissioner, state correction
commissioner, chief of the city housing police and city correction
commissioner.
   The commissioner oversaw a department with 26,790 officers. In
resigning, he noted that it had grown by 2,129 officers during his
tenure and that the number of black officers rose 17 percent,
Hispanics 60 percent and women 85 percent.
   The uniformed force now is 11 percent black, 11.5 percent
Hispanic and 12.4 percent female, he said.
   Ward also cited increased educational requirements for certain
ranks, a ``stronger stand'' on domestic violence and a program to
put officers back on foot patrol in all 75 precincts.

   The Herald has a daily circulation of approximately 28,000, the
Island Packet of 10,000 and The Beaufort Gazette of 9,000.
   ``These are quality newspapers in quality markets,'' said Erwin
Potts, president and chief executive officer of McClatchy
Newspapers.
   ``Our company's record in publishing small and medium-sized
newspapers suggests we can continue the improvement of these South
Carolina newspapers as they grow in size and importance to their
communities.''
   Frank Daniels Jr., president of the News &amp; Observer Publishing
Co., said he was ``pleased we are selling the newspapers to a
company with McClatchy's reputation for news and editorial
excellence, integrity and concern for its employees. Our people and
our communities will be well-served.''
   The company's papers include The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh,
N.C., and The Raleigh Times.
   McClatchy publishes six dailies and seven smaller newspapers in
California, Washington state and Alaska. Its flagship newspaper,
The Sacramento Bee, has a circulation of 250,000 daily and 300,000
Sundays. McClatchy's other dailies include the 60,000-circulation
Anchorage Daily News, which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for

   Economist Eliot Janeway, an adviser to

drugs away to cut crime and illicit drug profits.
   ``Let's fall back on an ancient, honorable, all-American

<HEAD>Utah Teachers Stage Walkout to Protest Funding Woes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty-thousand teachers were returning to
classes today following a one-day walkout, but pledged to maintain
pressure for greater funding for a crowded school system that ranks
last in per-pupil expenditures.
   ``We will keep the pressure on,'' said Utah Education
Association President Jim Campbell.
   The walkout gave 435,000 children an unexpected holiday when all
but two of Utah's 40 school districts were closed down Monday.
   The strike was incited by the Legislature's decision during a
special session last week to give residents a $38.4 million tax
rebate, and not to allocate money to education from a $94 million
surplus.
   The walkout began with a wildcat strike Friday morning at Davis
High School in Davis County, just north of Salt Lake City, and
spread to schools in three other large school districts by the end
of the day.
   Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter and the Republican-controlled
Legislature, who drew the wrath of teachers as they previously drew
the ire of taxpayers for a record tax hike two years ago, pledged
money would be found for education during the regular legislative
session, which begins in January.
   With a population of 1.7 million, Utah has the largest average
household size at 3.17, compared with the national average of 2.62.
Nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the Mormon
Church, which encourages large families, and the state has the
nation's highest percentage of school-age children, with 37 percent
under 18.
   With a student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1, Utah also has the
most overcrowded classrooms, and at $22,621 a year its teachers
earn smaller salaries than educators in 43 other states, according
to the union. The state ranks 50th in the average annual
expenditure per student of $2,326, according to the union.
   Years of budget cuts have produced increasing complaints about
outdated textbooks and inadequate supplies, with many teachers
saying they've had to pay hundreds of dollars out of their own
pockets to provide basic supplies.
   ``We've had truck drivers, steelworkers, housewives, retired
workers and parents calling to say, `It's about time,''' said
Campbell, whose organization represents up to 90 percent of the
state's teachers.
   Bob Chase, vice president of the National Education Association,
assured more than 3,000 teachers gathered at Liberty Park on Monday
that they had the support of some 2 million teachers for their
``courageous act of conscience.''
   Bangerter defended the tax cut.
   ``You have to remember I was the one who raised taxes two years
ago,'' he said.
   That record tax hike sparked tax-slashing initiatives that were
defeated by nearly a 2-to-1 margin in November's election, but the
governor and legislative leaders decided to cut taxes when an
economic resurgence brought the budget surplus.
   The governor has said teachers should have waited until the
regular legislative session to press their demands, but he
acknowledged the walkout got attention.
   ``There is a perception out there that all of the money has been
given back. It hasn't,'' Bangerter said. ``After the tax cut that
was passed by the Legislature, we still have a $55 million surplus
this year and $100 million from the last two years.''
   He said education would be treated ``honorably and honestly'' in
January.

   Motorists were surprised to find $100
bills blowing across the highway. And police were surprised three
motorists turned the money in.
   The St. Clair County Sheriff's Department was called to
investigate Sunday after motorists reported finding nearly $2,000
in bills of $100, $20, $10 and $1 blowing across State 159.
   ``Nobody knows where it came from,'' said St. Richard Scott.
   One of those who turned in money, Evie Gorski, said she owns a
business and knows how important the loss can be.
   ``We're hoping somebody would do the same if we had lost money
ourselves,'' said the 40-year-old Edwardsville resident.
   She was accompanied by Susan Lybarger, 42, of a rural Worden,
who collected almost $1,000. Donald Cuff, 29, of Caseyville, also
turned in money.
   Scott said the three told deputies that another motorists
stopped, picked up money and drove off. That person hasn't been
identified.
   If no one presents proof of ownership in 30 days, the money can
be returned to the finders, Scott said.

<HEAD>Stocks Hit New High, Dollar Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
new high today after its second-largest one-day gain this year,
while the U.S. dollar fell marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 484.11
points, or 1.38 percent, closing at 35,444.82. The previous record
close was 35,140.83 on Aug. 21.
   Tuesday's gain was the largest since a 793.96-point rise March
28. The Nikkei had climbed 188.92 points Monday.
   The dollar closed at 142.80 yen, down 0.15 yen from its finish
of 142.95 yen on Monday, when it fell 2.05 yen. It opened today at
142.25 yen and moved between 142.10 yen and 143.15 yen.
   Bank of Japan Vice Governor Yasushi Miyeno told reporters today
that the trend is toward a lower dollar and higher yen after the
``Group of Seven'' industrialized nations agreed in Washington
Saturday to cooperate in foreign exchange markets to stem the
dollar's recent rise.
   He said Japan's central bank would continue taking appropriate
measures, keeping close contact with other G-7 nations.
   Another Bank of Japan official said the central bank would
prefer the dollar to decline to its levels of ``six months ago.''
At that time, the dollar was trading at about 132 yen.
   The G-7 statement said, ``A rise of the dollar above currents
levels or an excessive decline could affect adversely prospects for
the world economy.''
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank, said the Bank of
Japan intervened intermittently today, selling small amounts of
dollars to halt a new upswing, but the amount of selling was
unknown. The central bank does not comment on its money market
activities.
   ``For a while, the dollar is unlikely to rise back much because
the G-7 central banks will coordinate intervention actively,'' Ms.
Takeuchi added.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index rose mainly
because investors were reassured by the yen's recovery against the
dollar.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
investors bought aggressively because today was the actual first
day of a new financial year for most businesses.
   The new business year starts Oct. 1 for most Japanese companies,
but stock transactions for the next business year start five days
earlier, Nomura explained.
   Investment trust companies were aggressive buyers today, mainly
purchasing high-tech, financial and electric power company issues,
Nomura said.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 900
million shares, a large increase from Monday's 550 million.

   Newspapers in cities pummeled by Hurricane
Hugo found the storm was a journalist's dream and a publisher's
nightmare as they labored to get out the big story without power,
water or passable roads.
   Most papers in the storm's path through South Carolina managed
to keep printing, but it wasn't easy.
   In Columbia, The State newspaper temporarily housed two other
papers. The staff of the Charleston papers didn't go home for
several nights. In Myrtle Beach, The Sun News staff used portable
toilets because the city sewers were out of commission.
   ``We got the paper out (Friday) and have been doing it ever
since,'' said Bob Hawkins, an editor at The News and Courier and
The Evening Post in hard-hit Charleston.
   ``A couple of nights everyone slept on the floor at the
newspaper,'' Hawkins said. ``We didn't smell too good.''
   The newspaper's emergency generator provided enough electricity
to run the printing press, computers and a few lights, but the
staff was still without running water Monday.
   Hugo struck South Carolina late Thursday, killing at least 17
people and leaving more than $3 billion in damage.
   Some papers were able to gather and print the information their
readers needed to cope during the storm's aftermath, but couldn't
manage delivery.
   In Georgetown, 10-foot waves lapped up against the windows of
the Georgetown Times. Two delivery vans were swallowed up, and
employees delivered the paper in their own cars.
   Saturday's paper was delayed one day because the newspaper
building was blacked out Friday.
   The storm was ``a journalist's dream, but at the same time a
nightmare,'' said Ralph Parkman, publisher of the thrice-weekly.
   The copy editing staff of The Sun News in Myrtle Beach was sent
140 miles to Columbia to work on Friday and Saturday editions at
The State, a sister newspaper. Deadlines were moved up, but
carriers still weren't able to deliver to all subscribers because
some roads were inaccessible.
   To conserve water, Publisher Michael Pate ordered some unusual
equipment for the office.
   ``We had to bring in porta-potties,'' he said.
   The State newspaper had to restart its presses a few times
because of power fluctuations, managing editor Bobby Hitt said. The
paper also housed some members of The Sun News staff and helped the
Charleston paper paste up its pages.
   The Item in Sumter couldn't publish Friday or Saturday because
the power was off and no generators were available, managing editor
Graham Osteen said.
   ``Everyone was totally immobilized. We couldn't even get out of
town to produce a paper,'' he said.
   The staff printed its Sunday and Monday papers at The Times and
Democrat, 85 miles away in Orangeburg.
   ``The response we've been getting is people were unbelievably
grateful to get a paper'' Sunday, Osteen said. ``They've had very
little information.''
   Most radio and television stations in the area were off the air
for a few days following the storm.
   The Island Packet in Hilton Head, which is printed at The
Gazette, had problems getting carriers to deliver its Friday
edition because the island had been evacuated.
   Then again, ``we had no one to deliver it to Friday morning,''
editor Fran Smith said.

   Robert Chambers, the prep-school student who
strangled an 18-year-old woman in Central Park, was not allowed to
watch a TV movie about the case because he was caught twice with
marijuana in jail, officials said.
   Chambers was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day as punishment
after he was caught smoking marijuana in the prison yard May 16,
state Department of Corrections spokeswoman Amy Colodny said Monday.
   Less than a month later, guards found two marijuana cigarettes
in his cell, according to Colodny. That time, prison officials
disciplined Chambers by sending him to a special confinement area
for 15{ weeks, she said.
   Chambers returned to his cell Thursday, but continued to have
all privileges denied, except for one hour of recreation a day,
Colodny said.
   ``If he hadn't misbehaved, he could have watched the movie until
lockup at 10 o'clock,'' she said. ABC-TV broadcast a dramatization
of the case called ``The Preppie Murder'' from 9 to 11 p.m. Sunday.
   Guards also have found Chambers with a razor blade and
unauthorized legal papers, the spokeswoman said.
   Chambers, who turned 23 Monday, pleaded guilty to first degree
manslaughter in the Aug. 26, 1986, death of Jennifer Levin. He was
incarcerated in May 1988 at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in
upstate New York to serve his five- to 15-year term.
   Chambers' bad behavior will not change his parole eligibility
date of February 1993, Colodny said, but the parole board will
examine his record of conduct when deciding whether to grant parole.
   Levin's grandfather, Arnold Domenitz, said when told of
Chambers' infractions, ``This is an amoral character who doesn't
know right from wrong. ... I hope they throw the book at him.''

   No family members were present when Mrs. Bush was released and
she was accompanied by her private nurse, Brown said.
   ``She looked wonderful,'' Brown said.
   Brown said Mrs. Bush had fully recovered from pneumonia by

   Mrs. Bush was admitted to the hospital Sept. 18.
   Brown said Mrs. Bush planned to travel to Florida after

stuck in an 18-inch hole.
   As firefighters struggled to free the bulky explorer using ropes
and a harness, a sheriff's deputy suggested greasing him, and
firefighter Bill Miller rushed home for a gallon jug.
   ``We covered him in it, greased all the rocks, and then we
pulled him out,'' Riley said. ``It was the only way we could have
gotten him out.''
   Downey was shaken but unhurt, Riley said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Opposition Gird For Electoral Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an electoral battle between the
ruling Sandinistas and their U.S.-supported opponents, the
Sandinistas showed superior organization at a convention replete
with balloons, whistles and bells.
   A gathering of 1,746 delegates nominated President Daniel Ortega
on Sunday as the candidate of the leftist Sandinista National
Liberation Front for what may become the most hotly contested
election in Nicaraguan history on Feb. 25.
   The Sandinistas have an apparent victory under their belts in a
long war against Contra rebels.
   Opposition assets include an economy in disarray and a
well-known candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, widow of a hero
of the revolution that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   But the opposition is also a shaky coalition of 14 parties that
range from Communist to conservative. Their bitter closed-door
nomination meeting contrasted sharply with the lively Sandinista
convention.
   Ortega promised fair elections in return for a Central American
agreement to disband the U.S.-supported Contras by early December.
While that date might not be met, it appears that the end of the
war is in sight.
   ``The war against the Sandinista government is paralyzed because
of the peace accords,'' said Wycliff Diego, leader of a major
Indian resistance group from eastern Nicaragua.
   Diego became the latest leader to drop out of the armed
resistance when he said Monday that he would return to Nicaragua
this week to investigate setting up a political party and
supporting Mrs. Chamorro.
   But while the electoral process seems to be drawing in the
opposition and weakening the armed resistance, the Sandinista
platform slogan, ``Everything Will Be Better,'' exposed a crack in
an otherwise slick surface.
   The slogan is a reminder, if any were needed, that Nicaragua's
economy has gone steadily downhill, to the point that it rivals
Haiti as the poorest nation in the Americas.
   In an effort to control hyperinflation, the government has had
to implement an austerity program that left thousands jobless.
   The Sandinistas blame their problems on the war and a U.S.
economic boycott, but promises of better times ahead are being met
with skepticism by voters who must struggle daily to make ends meet
with less money, higher prices and food shortages.
   It was no surprise that Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez
were renominated; they have worked together smoothly in the past.
   Ortega is the tough, firebrand ex-guerrilla who doesn't miss a
chance to bait the U.S. government, while Ramirez is the cool,
moderate-toned, polished intellectual.
   In his acceptance speech, Ortega predicted the Sandinista would
win and that the United States ``will have to accept an
understanding with Nicaragua.''
   The Bush administration has already given signs of
accommodation; recently a top State Department official visited
Nicaragua and met with Ortega, the first time that has happened in
years.
   Ortega knows that winning U.S. acceptance, however reluctant, is
probably vital to economic recovery, but also that this depends on
his party winning the elections cleanly.
   The Sandinistas are intent on having the vote declared free and
fair and have invited international observers including former
President Jimmy Carter, who monitored Panama's presidential
election in May and called it a fraud.
   In an editorial, Mrs. Chamorro's newspaper La Prensa said
Ortega's speech showed the Sandinistas were depending on ``sterile
anti-Americanism'' and did not have a vision of the future to sell
the electorate.
   The Bush administration is trying to devise a way to assist
Nicaragua's fledgling democratic process without providing direct
support to the opposition.
   A figure of $9 million has been mentioned by U.S. congressional
sources; that would be more than $4 for each of Nicaragua's 1.9
million voters, but there are no signs of any big money yet.
   The Sandinistas has already called on its organizations, which
cover every neighborhood in the country, to begin house-to-house
campaigning, using the threat of a super-financed opposition for
motivation.
   The well-planned Sandinista convention, to which the press and
the diplomatic corps were invited, contrasted sharply with tense
deliberations of the political parties comprising the National
Opposition Union.
   The UNO, as it is known for its Spanish initials, chose Virgilio
Godoy as Mrs. Chamorro's running mate three weeks ago, but the
choice almost split the coalition.
   The choice was considered important because many view Mrs.
Chamorro as a figurehead. Conservatives supported businessman
Enrique Bolanos, but Godoy's supporters said Bolanos would tilt the
ticket too far to the right.

<HEAD>Engineer Of Great Escape Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wally Floody, the captured fighter pilot who
engineered the tunnel through which 76 Allied officers fled from a
Nazi prison in a story portrayed in the film The Great Escape, has
died at age 71.
   Floody died in a hospital Monday after a lengthy illness.
   ``He had chronic lung disease, partially due to the tunneling he
did during the war,'' said his son Brian. ``It only got severe
during the past several years.''
   A Royal Canadian Air Force officer, Floody used the mining
experience he gained in Kirkland Lake, Ont., to engineer and dig
the 350-foot tunnel out of Stalag Luft III.
   Of the 76 Allied officers who fled the camp on March 24, 1944,
only three eventually made good their escape. At least 50 of those
recaptured _ six of them Canadian _ were executed.
   Floody was moved to another camp just before the escape.
   ``Every time I tell my wife I might have been one of the
prisoners who got away, she reminds me: `Yes, but you might have
been one of the ones they shot,''' he said in a 1986 interview.
   The mass breakout was the subject of the 1963 movie The Great
Escape, starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Charles Bronson.
Floody was a technical advisor for the film.
   Floody was 23 when his Spitfire was shot down over France in
1941. He often served as the lead digger and passed buckets of the
sandy gravel back to a brigade of men working in the tunnels, which
were named Tom, Dick and Harry.
   The gravel was hidden in the camp's gardens.
   Floody became trapped several times in cave-ins and had to be
pulled out by his heels.
   The Germans eventually discovered Tom. Dick was abandoned and
Harry became the escape route.
   About 600 of the 1,500 officers in the camp helped dig the
tunnels but it was Floody who designed the lighting, ventilation
and electrical systems.
   ``Wally was living Canadian history,'' Clem Pearce, another
Canadian flyer who spent time in Stalag III, said Monday.
   ``He always kept on fighting, and other men took inspiration
from that. Whenever veterans got together, Wally was a center of
attention because of his fame as the Tunnel King,'' Pearce said.
   Floody remained in prison camps until the war ended. The
Chatham, Ont., native returned to Canada and began his business
career in Toronto. He also helped found the RCAF Prisoner-of-War
Association.
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and sons Brian and
Michael.

   Three people accused of kidnapping a
Guatemalan woman and keeping her enslaved for a year through
torture and rape have been arrested, authorities said.
   Two women, ages 28 and 32, and a man, 37, were arrested Monday
night after an informant's tip sent detectives to a camper truck
that matched the description of the one where the victim was
chained each night, said sheriff's Lt. Ray Grant.
   The woman escaped Sept. 2 by stealing keys from her sleeping
captors.
   ``She tried to escape once before but was beaten,'' said police
Detective Delia Perez.
   The 27-year-old woman told police she was kidnapped July 15,
1988, when a woman approached her at a bus stop and lured her into
the camper with the promise of a job.
   She was raped, tortured with electrical shocks and forced to
cook and clean for a man, two women and five children, police said.
At night, she was chained in the camper outside the group's home.
   Six children, ranging in age from infancy to 8 or 9 years old,
were taken into protective custody at the time of the arrests,
Grant said.
   Authorities withheld the names of the adults booked by Los
Angeles police for investigation of kidnapping, he said.
   Police said they do not doubt the victim's story.
   ``When I first read the report I said, `Aw, come on, these
things don't happen,''' said police Detective Dick Heidesch. ``But
several of us talked to the victim independently, a counselor
talked to her and everyone is convinced she is telling the truth.''

   Ten years ago, Linh Trang was one of the
first Vietnamese soldiers to enter Cambodia in a surprise invasion
that toppled the Khmer Rouge government in Phnom Penh.
   ``It was hell in Cambodia, 10 years of it,'' said Trang, 33, who
commanded a battallion in the guerrilla-infested jungles of western
Cambodia. ``I'm just glad to be going home.''
   This morning, those 10 years in hell ended as Trang and 10,000
other troops marched home through the gates of this sleepy border
town.
   Up and down the border, Vietnamese troops are coming home in
what the Hanoi government says is the withdrawal of its last 26,000
troops in Cambodia.
   Returning by ship, ferry, truck and on foot, the soldiers faced
a government-orchestrated hero's welcome today but an uncertain
future.
   Like many of his comrades, Trang was stricken by malaria during
the war. He also said he's lost 15 pounds, which means a lot to his
small frame.
   But, he said, none of his health problems concern him. What is
important now is to find a job.
   Last week, the chief spokesman of the Vietnamese Defense
Ministry said Vietnam would demobilize an unspecificied number of
solidiers after its war with Cambodia.
   Major Gen. Nguyen Van Thai said returning veterans would be
given preference in finding work and economic assistance if they
had difficulties.
   But many wonder whether Vietnam, which is one of the poorest
countries in Asia and already faces an unemployment crisis, will be
able to provide jobs for the returning soldiers.
   ``I am not a young man,'' said Trang, ``so I don't think I can
return to school. I want to work in textiles, maybe as a tailor.
Before I entered the army I was a tailor in Ho Chi Minh City.''
   Still, he said, nothing had been settled.
   Luon Van Dang is a little more sure about what he wants to do
but just as worried.
   The 23-year-old from Can Tho province says he will try to stay
in the armed forces, his home for the last five years.
   ``I like a soldier's life,'' he said as he squatted in the
buffer zone between Cambodia and Vietnam. ``I lost my family during
the Vietnam War so the army is my family. They feed me and clothe
me. I believe in them.''
   Dang said he hoped he would not be demobilized.
   ``My officers know I love the Vietnamese Army,'' he said, ``but
after I walk through the gate to my country over there everything
could change.''
   Hanoi has demobilized more than a half-million soldiers in
recent years, Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor of Vietnam's official army
newspaper, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
   He said the armed forces' manpower peak was 1.5 million in 1979,
50,000 were demobilized between 1982 and 1987, and over the past
two years Hanoi had released 500,000.
   Some soldiers said they will miss Cambodia.
   Earlier last week, at a good-bye ceremony at Pursat, a
provincial Cambodian capital, Cao Viet sat weeping in the corner as
he hugged a Cambodian brother-in-arms.
   ``We are very close to the people in the countryside,'' said the
Vietnamese officer who spent six years in Cambodia and speaks good
Khmer. ``We died for these people and they know it. I will never
forget the people here.''
   Behind him, a Cambodian cultural troupe played salsa music.
Vietnamese soldiers danced with Cambodian women. Bottles of Western
scotch were passed from hand to hand.
   Fighting in the jungles was difficult, Viet said. Lack of
transportation makes for shortages of drinking water and food. Many
nights he and his men went hungry, he said.
   ``A guerrilla enemy is very hard to destroy,'' Viet said. ``They
would attack and then disperse and chasing them with difficult.''
   The Vietnamese Army began as a guerrilla force when it battled
the French and American armies but it used more traditional methods
in fighting its war in Cambodia. Viet said he saw no irony in this.
   ``We were the liberators of Cambodia,'' he said. ``We did what
we had to do.''

<HEAD>Inmates Angered Over Columns Missing From Prison Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Department of Corrections has decided to
stop publishing stories on legal issues in the prison system's
monthly newspaper, angering inmates who say it was the most popular
feature in the paper.
   ``Several months ago, they told me there would be no more
articles on legal issues generally,'' said Guy Marble, an inmate
who has been editor of The Echo for the past four years. ``That's
probably the most-read part of the paper, and it's definitely the
part we got the most complaints about if it wasn't there.''
   The legal section of the newspaper included a column by the
corrections department's staff counsel, articles by inmates
discussing recent court decisions and reprints of ``free world''
stories that address penal issues, Dallas-based Texas Lawyer
newspaper reported.
   Corrections department Deputy Director Andy Collins denied
Monday that he has banned law-related stories, but said the
articles on legal issues often were inaccurate. Collins said he
prefers to devote space to describing prison services available to
inmates to prepare them for the real world.
   ``I'm not going to do any free advertising for lawyers, and I'm
not going to teach people how to sue,'' Collins said. ``But we will
do articles on things like the services provided for inmates by the
inmate attorney.''
   Staff attorney Randy Farrar, whose state-supported office offers
legal advice to inmates, said he had completed columns for the May
and June issues when word came they wouldn't be used. Farrar said a
column on the Open Records Act might have displeased a corrections
department board member.
   The legal issues column addressed such subjects as the
consequences of filing frivolous appeals and changes in such
matters as deadly weapons findings by juries and whether notaries
are needed for certain legal documents.
   Marble said several inmates have indicated they plan to file
suit over the format change.
   ``I get sued every day and I'm sure I'll get sued over this,''
Collins said. ``It's part of my job.''

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in calm European trading this morning following reported
intervention by the Japanese and West German central banks, dealers
said.
   Gold prices eased on profit-taking.
   The Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank chiefs
announced their determination at a weekend meeting in Washington to
stop the dollar's rise, and dealers predicted the interventions
would succeed.
   ``There is a seriousness behind the statements that they really
want to pressure the dollar,'' said Gerhard Sunderdiek, a dealer at
the Bank of America in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.15 yen to a closing 142.80 yen. It was
quoted at the same level later in London.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9035 West German marks, down from 1.9055
   _1.6530 Swiss francs, down from 1.6565
   _6.4485 French francs, down from 6.4540
   _2.1499 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1480
   _1,375.00 Italian lire, down from 1,377.00
   _1.1750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1776
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6135 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6080 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $366.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $367.00. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.75, unchanged from late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 0.33 to close at a bid $367.53.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.27 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Monday.

   Cambodian resistance groups claim
tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have disguised themselves as
Cambodians and will remain in the country despite Hanoi's claims of
a total troop withdrawal.
   The resistance charge is emerging as its central argument to
justify an escalation of the war in Cambodia, despite the absence
of any hard evidence of a large-scale plan by the Vietnamese army
to remain in Cambodia.
   Vietnam said the last of its forces will be out of Cambodia,
which it invaded in late 1978, by midnight today. But officials of
all three major resistance groups characterize the pullout as an
elaborate hoax.
   ``The Vietnamese will not withdraw from Cambodia,'' said Prince
Norodom Rannaridth in a recent interview. ``We are not fighting a
civil war. It will remain a war to liberate Cambodia from
Vietnamese occupation.''
   The prince leads the army loyal to his father, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who heads a loose coalition which also includes the Khmer
Rouge and the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   The Sihanoukists charge that more than 30,000 Vietnamese have
already been disguised as troops or militia of the Phnom Penh
government or as Vietnamese civilians living in the country. Others
are operating in remote areas as regular Vietnamese troops, they
claim.
   Khmer Rouge radio claimed in a recent broadcast that the number
of disguised Vietnamese troops is 110,000.
   While the resistance and defectors fleeing to the Thai-Cambodian
border often cite specific units and figures where the subterfuge
is supposedly occurring, Western analysts following developments in
Cambodia are still uncertain.
   ``I have heard many reports of Vietnamese disguised as Phnom
Penh troops, but we cannot confirm anything,'' one analyst said.
``I am not saying it isn't happening but we have no proof.''
   ``All they (the resistance) need is one piece of hard evidence,
one captured document or officer,'' said another Cambodia watcher.
``But until then nobody will believe them. Nobody except
Cambodians, who are always ready to believe in the worst intentions
of the Vietnamese.''
   Cambodia experts point out that a total Vietnamese pullout would
greatly undermine the resistance battle cry that they are fighting
their historic enemies, the Vietnamese, and preventing them from
``swallowing the country.''
   But should there be truth in the resistance claims, Vietnam
would jeopardize its sorely needed economic assistance from
non-communist nations which have shunned it since the invasion.
   Hanoi hopes the withdrawal will end its isolation.
   The resistance groups say disguised Vietnamese units are used
only to support government troops who are faring poorly in combat
against their fighters.
   ``The Vietnamese are in (Cambodian Prime Minister) Hun Sen
uniforms. I have seen many of them,'' said 25-year-old Mao Souen, a
defector from the Phnom Penh army. ``In my unit there were six
Vietnamese experts. They are in Hun Sen uniforms like me. Before
they were in Vietnamese uniforms, but three months ago they
switched.''
   The chief military analyst of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, Dr. Abdul Gaffar, said a number of disguised
Vietnamese were fighting in Pailin. Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh
troops are reportedly locked in fierce battle for the gem-rich,
Thai-Cambodian border town.
   Gaffar said two regiments of Hanoi's 330th Division had been
integrated into Phnom Penh's 92nd Division while three other
Vietnamese regiments had shed their own uniforms.
   The resistance also points to Vietnamese civilians living in
Cambodia as proof of Hanoi's intention to colonize their country.
It places the number of these settlers at 1.25 million. Vietnamese
officials say there are only 80,000 while some Western diplomats
estimate 200,000.
   Most are shopkeepers, skilled workers and fishermen. Many have
left or are leaving, fearing for their safety after the Vietnamese
military shield is withdrawn.

<HEAD>Quebec Re-elects Liberals; English Speakers Register Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Liberal Party governing Quebec retained its
majority over a steady challenge from the separatist Parti
Quebecois and a surprising protest vote from the province's
English-speaking minority.
   Results of Monday's vote in the largest and second most populous
Canadian province showed the Liberals led by Premier Robert
Bourassa with 92 seats in the 125-seat provincial assembly.
   The Parti Quebecois won 29 seats, a gain of six, and a new
Equality Party captured four in traditional Liberal strongholds.
   ``I believe that this is a sign of confidence,'' a smiling
Bourassa, whose early hopes for a calm campaign capitalizing on
four years of continuing prosperity in Canada's largest province
had been dashed by environmental protests and labor unrest, said at
his district headquarters.
   The Parti Quebecois had been reeling from its provincial
election debacle four years ago in which it lost power to Bourassa
and fell to only 23 of the then-122 seat assembly.
   Jacques Parizeau, who won an internal party battle to put it
back on a hard-line course last year, ran a strong campaign on a
platform of eventual independence for the majority French-speaking
province.
   ``We have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is
the right one,'' Parizeau said Monday night in reiterating his
separatist aims. Supporters chanted ``Le Quebec aux Quebecois,'' or
``Quebec for Quebecers.''
   The Equality Party was formed by English speakers irate over
Quebec's language policies that still restrict all outdoor signs to
French. Supporters at party headquarters sang ``O Canada,'' the
national anthem, at their victory celebration.
   ``I have never been so proud to be a Canadian and a Quebecois in
my life,'' said Robert Libman, 29-year-old architect who formed the
Equality Party just months ago.
   Bourassa, an economist, counted on Quebecers being more
interested in pragmatic issues related to prosperity than to
independence. He pointed to a 4 percent annual economic growth
rate, the creation of 233,000 new jobs and the social stability
that lasted most of his term.
   But the idea of separatism for Quebec, thought to have been put
to rest in a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters
rebuffed it, held on to its current of support.
   The Parti Quebecois won 38.7 percent of the popular vote in the
December 1985 provincial election. Projections were that it had
increased slightly to 40 percent Monday.
   Bourassa's support among Quebec's English-speaking minority,
which traditionally had voted Liberal, was hurt by his refusal in
December to allow more than a token change in provincial laws
restricting commercial signs to the French language.
   His compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors as
long as the French-language portion was significantly larger than
the English.
   Quebec, which has a population of 6.5 million, is 81 percent
French-speaking.
   Supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to
protect French and Quebec's special culture surrounded by English
elsewhere in North America. Those who oppose the restrictions say
they violate basic rights.
   Bourassa's term before the language uproar last winter was
unusually quiet as Quebec settled into a period of strong economic
growth, leading to speculation that the Parti Quebecois could be
facing its last days.
   The separatist party had controlled the provincial government
from 1976, at the height of the period when power in Quebec shifted
from the English-speaking minority to the French majority, to their
defeat in 1985.
   Monday's victory confirmed the comeback by Bourassa, whose
colorless style could almost be considered a trademark.
   He was the youngest premier ever elected in Quebec when he won
the 1970 election at the age of 36, but the Parti Quebecois then
ousted him six years later at the height of separatist sentiment.

<HEAD>Bus Rams Newspaper Office in Apparent Retaliation for Photos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The office of a newspaper that has been
criticized for running photographs of a man electrocuted in an
accident was rammed by a bus spray-painted with messages demanding
respect for the dead man.
   Police questioned a man whose wallet was found under the bus
that crashed into the lobby of The Mesa Tribune early Monday. The
man, whose surname is the same as the dead man's, refused to
cooperate, said police spokesman Mike Hayes.
   No one was injured in the incident.
   The Tribune printed two color photos last week with a brief
story on the death of Mark Tracy, 25, who was killed Sept. 18 when
he touched a power line while trimming a palm tree.
   The newspaper ran one photo showing Tracy's legs as paramedics
lowered him from the tree. The other photo showed a relative
leaning against an ambulance, hyperventilating, after seeing Tracy
die.
   Tracy's friends and relatives flooded the paper with angry calls
and letters about the photos.
   An anonymous caller to Phoenix television station KTSP claimed
responsibility for ramming the building because the newspaper
``disgraced'' Tracy, said Mary Morse, a morning producer.
   The wallet found at the scene led police to Lloyd Ray Tracy, 33,
Hayes said. Officers also found a bill of sale for the bus made out
to Tracy, though it was still registered to another man, Hayes said.
   Police were unsure of the relationship between Lloyd Tracy and
the dead man, Hayes said.
   The 1956 school bus was spray-painted with ``We love you Mark,
rest in peace,'' and ``We demand respect for Mark Tracy.''
   Tribune publisher Michael Laosa said the decision to publish the
photos was like ``any other decision that our editors have to make
on a daily basis.''
   Laosa added: ``They think it and rethink it and make a decision
to run or not run it. We will continue to make those kinds of
judgments as the situations present themselves. I wish there was an
easy answer.''

Picks up 3rd graf pvs, `The lawsuit ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Billy Joel is suing his former manager
for $90 million, alleging that he stole millions of dollars and
lost millions more in risky investments such as horsebreeding.
   The suit was filed Monday, the day after Joel was hospitalized
with severe abdominal pain from kidney stones, the New York Post
reported today.
   The pain struck Joel as he waited Sunday afternoon at John F.
Kennedy International Airport for a Concorde supersonic flight to
London, said Joel's lawyer, Leonard Marks. The trip was part of a
tour of Europe to promote his new album, ``Storm Front.''
   Marks would not disclose the name of the hospital. ``He's in
this country and he's OK _ that's all I can tell you,'' he said.
   The lawsuit was filed in state court against Frank Weber, who
was fired Aug. 30, after an audit uncovered the alleged thefts,
Marks said. Weber also was Joel's former brother-in-law.
   The lawsuit charges that Weber used Joel's money in the form of
interest-free loans; misued his power of attorney by signing the
singer's name to documents without his consent; and invested Joel's
money in high-risk ventures despite the singer's express
instructions to invest conservatively.
   Court documents said the horsebreeding venture in which Weber
invested without his consent, Thoroughbred Breeding Associates, is
a partnership with Weber as general partner.
   There was no answer at Weber's lawyer's office when The
Associated Press called Monday.

   Robert Chambers, the former prep-school student
who strangled an 18-year-old woman in Central Park, was not allowed
to watch a TV movie about the case because he was caught twice with
marijuana in jail, officials said.
   Chambers was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day as punishment
after he was caught smoking marijuana in the prison yard May 16,
state Department of Corrections spokeswoman Amy Colodny said Monday.
   Less than a month later, guards found two marijuana cigarettes
in his cell, according to Colodny. That time, prison officials
disciplined Chambers by sending him to a special confinement area
for 15{ weeks, she said.
   Chambers returned to his cell Thursday but continued to have all
privileges denied, except for one hour of recreation a day, Colodny
said.
   ``If he hadn't misbehaved, he could have watched the movie until
lockup at 10 o'clock,'' she said. ABC broadcast a dramatization of
the case called ``The Preppie Murder'' from 9 to 11 p.m. Sunday.
   Guards also have found Chambers with a razor blade and
unauthorized legal papers, the spokeswoman said.
   Chambers, who turned 23 Monday, pleaded guilty to manslaughter
in the 1986 death of Jennifer Levin. He was incarcerated in May
1988 at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in upstate New York to
serve his five- to 15-year term.
   Chambers' bad behavior will not change his parole eligibility
date of February 1993, Colodny said, but the parole board will
examine his record of conduct when deciding whether to grant parole.
   Levin's grandfather, Arnold Domenitz, said when told of
Chambers' infractions, ``This is an amoral character who doesn't
know right from wrong. ... I hope they throw the book at him.''

   ``The Satanic Verses'' is one novel that shook
the world. But one year and 1.1 million hardback copies after it
was released, the factors publishers weigh in deciding what to
print remain the same, experts say.
   ``The book was one of a kind _ I mean it was a fictional fantasy
that happened to affect large numbers of people and particularly
people in positions of power, and I think that's a very unlikely
thing to be repeated right now,'' said John Baker, editor-in-chief
of Publisher's Weekly, a trade magazine.
   Viking Penguin Inc. published the book a year ago.
   Five months later, on Feb. 14, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini fixed the world's attention on it when he put a $5.2
million bounty on the life of its Moslem author, Salman Rushdie.
Khomeini also urged Moslems to kill his publishers.
   The book, which most Moslem countries banned because they said
it blasphemed Islam, plunged Iran into a confrontation with the
West.
   Viking Penguin says its decision to publish the book was not
influenced by its potentially inflamatory content.
   ``We certainly didn't buy `The Satanic Verses' because we
thought it would be controversial. We bought it because we think
Salman Rushdie is one of the most distinguished authors of the late
20th century,'' said Paul Slovak, a spokesman at the publishing
house.
   Slovak declined Monday to disclose sales or profit figures for
the book. But he added that despite the huge sales, Viking Penguin
may just about break even because of costly security measures it
was forced to take.
   ``We can't let our guard down completely even now,'' he said.
   On Sunday, a London newspaper reported that a paperback edition
of the book would come out this winter but that the exact date was
being kept secret for security reasons. Earlier, there were reports
that plans for a paperback edition had been shelved for fear of
more violence.
   The book's hardback release in England on Sept. 22, 1988, led to
a series of bookstore bombings and other troubles, including the
refusal of some stores to stock it out of fear for their safety.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' first appeared in U.S. stores in January,
though it wasn't officially released in this country until Feb. 22.
   David Rubin, a New York University journalism professor, said
the determining factor among book publishers in deciding what books
to offer is profitability, not whether it will be controversial.
   ``The notion of publishing a book because it is critical of
government or some group _ Palestinians, Moslems, or Jews _ and
banking on that and the publicity that may come from it is much too
speculative a strategy for people who are basically kind of
accountants,'' Rubin said.
   And Barbara Reno, a spokeswoman for Simon &amp; Schuster, said:
``People assume a lot of the time publishers aren't publishing a
book because they're worried about controversy _ in fact, they're
making business decisions.''
   Jeffrey Robinson, who wrote a best-selling, controversial
biography of former Saudi Arabian oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani
published in England, said profit motivated Viking Penguin to print
more copies of ``The Satanic Verses'' when demand skyrocketed.
   ``That's just fueling the fires,'' said Robinson.``I think most
publishers would be very wary of getting involved with a book like
that again.
   ``But there will always be somebody.''
   Morgan Entrekin, an independent publisher under the umbrella of
Atlantic Monthly Press, said: ``It gets very dangerous if you let
yourself get censored a priori. I don't go looking for trouble, but
I try not to let it influence me too much.''
   Charles Hayward, president of Simon &amp; Schuster's trade division,
said controversy should not factor into a book's rejection.
   ``I don't think you can be selective; you've got to publish
books that deserve to be published, otherwise that's where the
self-censorship would begin and where would it end?
   ``Satanic Verses was such an extreme, there's no way to
anticipate that type of outrageous reaction.''
   But, he admitted, ``We sometimes buy controversial books to
generate news.''

<HEAD>Artillery Shells Fall on Siberian Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fire in an ammunition depot sent a cascade of
artillery shells raining on a Siberian city, killing one person and
forcing the evacuation of 20,000 residents, Moscow Radio and a
newspaper said today.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said the shelling of Yurga, 1,500 miles
east of Moscow, began Thursday night after acetone stored in a
munitions warehouse caught fire and exploded.
   ``Shells started flying in every direction,'' the newspaper
said. It said the force of the explosion hurled some shells into
fields and forests and others into the nearby city. None of the
shells exploded.
   One soldier died and several civil defense workers were injured
in the blast, the reports said.
   Radio Moscow said, ``the Siberian city of Yurga suffered from a
veritable shelling.''
   It said the artillery shells demolished a private home, damaged
the roof of a five-story office building and tore off the corner of
a child-care center.
   The residents were evacuated because of fears that one of the
shells might have landed in the chlorine gas storage area of a
water-filtering plant and could possibly have exploded.
   Investigators said the danger had passed, but did not say
whether the residents had returned, Komsomolskaya Pravda said.

<TEXT>
   A physician, free after two years in jail for
refusing to let her daughter visit her former husband, says she
realizes she could wind up back behind bars in her bitter child
custody battle.
   ``I don't know that anything is over,'' Dr. Elizabeth Morgan
said shortly after she was released Monday from the District of
Columbia jail. ``I could be jailed again, and I know that, and my
daughter remains unprotected.''
   Morgan, 41, was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in
August 1987 after failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter Hilary
for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and
the girl's father. She has alleged that Foretich sexually abused
Hilary; Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges.
   Her release was the result of a law passed by Congress and
signed by President Bush last week limiting civil contempt jail
terms in the District of Columbia to 12 months. The law expires
after 18 months.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who sponsored the bill which resulted
in her release, said today that Morgan still could be charged with
criminal contempt. ``So I suspect this case is not over,'' he said
on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   Foretich, appearing on the same program, said, ``I'm delighted
that Elizabeth Morgan is out of jail. I only wish this could be
coupled with some concern for my missing daughter. I would have
been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating
a government agency such as the FBI be required to find my
daughter.''
   While Morgan smiled during a news conference and held hands with
her fiance, federal appeals court judge Paul R. Michel, she
acknowledged that her legal fight is far from over.
   ``I intend to stay here and work through the legal system until
(Hilary) is safe,'' Morgan said. ``I will never give up.''
   ``I cannot say where she is if there is a possibility she would
be returned'' to Foretich, she said.
   Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's attorney, said after Morgan was
released that further proceedings against her are ``quite likely.''
   Morgan ``remains in contempt of court, and this law doesn't
change that,'' Ms. Mittleman said. ``That's not being vengeful;
it's just what the law is about.''
   Foretich's attorney maintained in court papers that the new law
was unconstitutional because it infringed on the power of the
judicial branch to enforce its orders.
   Ms. Mittleman also charged in her papers that the law violated
several of Foretich's constitutional rights, among them the right
to due process of law.
   District Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Alprin signed the order
freeing Morgan.
   A cold, driving rain greeted her as she emerged from the jail,
riding in a car accompanied by Michel and her attorney, Stephen
Sachs.
   ``I feel very happy and very grateful to everyone that has
helped me,'' she said, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and
clutching a dozen yellow roses given her by Michel. ``I will
probably cry when I say this, but I want to thank God for every
angel on Earth who has helped me.''
   Meeting reporters later after changing into a blue dress with
white polka dots, Morgan said she was ``stunned ... It's a bit like
being born again.''
   Refusing to disclose Hilary's whereabouts, she said her daughter
is better off than she was when Morgan started the jail term.
   ``She's happy where she is,'' Morgan said. ``She's made a
remarkable recovery. She obviously misses me, as I miss her, but
she has no desire to return if it means further incest.''
   Asked whether she had heard from her daughter during her two
years behind bars, Morgan responded, ``Yes, but I won't tell you
how'' and added, ``If I were going to my daughter I would not tell
you.''
   Morgan was asked what the future holds and replied, ``I hope it
doesn't hold jail.'' She said she was going ``wherever my fiance
will take me.''
   Morgan was asked what she would say if she could talk to her
daughter.
   She paused, then said, ``You're a wonderful girl, and it was
worth every minute... I hope the last two years were just the
beginning of a lifetime of safety.''

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricity
and phones at Heritage USA, hastening the closing of much of the
Christian theme park and retreat built by Jim Bakker.
   ``We were planning to close the hotel anyhow. It was a cash
drain,'' M.C. Benton, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the
property, said Monday.
   The 11-year-old, 2,200-acre park was shut down Friday after
Hugo's assault. The Heritage Grand Hotel, full of charismatic
Christians and curiosity-seekers before Bakker's downfall in a sex
and money scandal, had been nearly empty in recent months.
   Bakker resigned from the ministry in 1987 and PTL filed for
bankruptcy. Bakker is on trial in Charlotte, N.C., on charges of
defrauding followers by diverting nearly $4 million in donations to
live in high style.
   Prosecutors said he oversold ``lifetime partnerships''
guaranteeing major contributors lodging at the Heritage Grand.
   Heritage USA in its heyday drew millions of believers. In
addition to Jim and Tammy Bakker, the attractions included the
ornate hotel, a water park, shops, a TV studio and church and
residential areas.
   Only the residential areas _ condominiums, houses and apartments
_ remain open.
   Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick last week said he had
withdrawn his offer of $65 million for Heritage USA.
   He won court approval in December to buy the park but could not
get the title insurance needed to close the deal because of a claim
to the land from an Indian tribe.
   ``There are still a few interested players yet,'' Benton said.
``I've gotten no written bid, but there has been expression of
interest.''

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Rebound 3.8 Percent in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods,
boosted by robust automobile sales, rebounded a strong 3.8 percent
in August for their steepest advance this year, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally
adjusted $126.7 billion, their biggest increase since a 7.4 percent
advance last December.
   The August advance came after a bigger decline than previously
thought in July. July orders fell 2.5 percent rather than the 1.9
percent originally reported. Orders had risen 1.3 percent in June.
   Durable goods orders, a bellweather of the economy's
performance, have bounced up and down throughout the year, rising
in March, April, June and August and falling in January, February,
May and July.
   Transportation equipment orders were up 6.7 percent to $36.3
billion as a large increase in motor vehicles and parts more than
offset a decline in aircraft and parts. Transportation orders had
risen 1.8 percent in July.
   Excluding the transportation category, durable goods orders were
up 2.7 percent.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and a
wide variety of industrial equipment, increased 9.2 percent to
$22.8 billion after a 10.4 percent decline in July.
   The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector fell 9.8
percent to $37.4 billion. Economists use this category as a
barometer of business investment plans.
   Orders for both electrical machinery and primary metals,
including steel, were down last month, the department said.
   Electrical machinery orders fell 0.9 percent to $19.6 billion,
with communications equipment showing the largest decrease.
   Primary metals were off 1.9 percent to $11.3 billion.
   Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month
to month, orders rose 3.9 percent in August after falling 1.5
percent in July.
   Volatile military orders increased 1.9 percent to $7.8 billion
after plunging 14.7 percent in July.
   Shipments of durable goods in August rose a record 9.5 percent
to $128.4 billion, much of it reflecting automobiles. The previous
high during the current seven-year economic expansion was a 4.5
percent increase in January 1983.

<HEAD>Police Say Fire Aboard Ferry Deliberately Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fire that killed two people and
injured dozens aboard a huge North Sea passenger ferry apparently
was deliberately set, police said today.
   The 600-foot Tor Scandinavia was traveling from Goteborg,
Sweden, to Harwich, England, with 650 passengers and crew when the
fire broke out at dawn Monday.
   The fire was put out within a few hours and the Danish ferry,
owned by the shipping company Scandinavian Seaways, sailed under
its own power to its home port, Esbjerg.
   Esbjerg police inspector Herluf Mogensen, head of the
investigation, said the fire started in a hall with linen closets,
close to a staircase on a passenger deck in the bow. The staircase
leads up to the radio room. Mogensen said electric failure had been
excluded as a cause of the blaze.
   ``Theoretically a cigarette could have been accidentally dropped
in one of the 10 trolleys standing in the hall with linen, but the
violent development of the fire indicates it was helped and that it
was deliberately set,'' Mogensen told the Associated Press.
   He said a crew member carried out a routine inspection 40
minutes before the fire started and found everything was normal.
   Mogensen declined to say if there were any suspects.
   A middle-aged Swedish couple was found dead in a cabin close to
where the fire started.
   Mogensen said 35 persons suffering from smoke inhalation were
treated in hospital. Shipping company officials said Monday that 10
were injured. Danish radio reported Monday night that about 50 were
taken to hospital when the ferry reached Esbjerg. The reason for
the discrepancies was not immediately explained.

<HEAD>Institute Fails To Duplicate Results of Fusion Experiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experiments at the University of Utah's
new National Cold Fusion Institute have shown no sign of producing
fusion, says the director of the research center.
   ``We have a conference coming up here next February,'' said
director Hugo Rossi. ``If we don't have any papers to present, then
this place will be closing up shop. I'm not saying I will do that.
I'm just saying I think that is what would happen.''
   The center was set up by the state after chemists B. Stanley
Pons and Martin Fleischmann announced at the university in March
that they had harnessed the energy source that powers the sun by
achieving fusion at room temperature in a jar.
   Rossi said Monday the institute's more than 20 electrochemical
cells, all variations of Pons and Fleischmann's experiment, have
produced no excess heat and no fusion products such as neutrons or
tritium.
   ``It's gotten to be time for us to start wondering if we're
doing anything wrong,'' said Rossi. He called the situation
``unnerving.''
   Scientists around the world have had difficulty duplicating Pons
and Fleischmann's experiments, which held out the possibility of a
cheap, relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible supply of energy.
   Conventional nuclear energy, or fission, splits atoms; fusion
produces energy by fusing them together.
   Rossi said the institute is negotiating with the Electric Power
Research Institute in Menlo Park, Calif., for funding. The
institute so far has only $4.3 million in state money to spend on
research. Neither Rossi nor Fritz Kulhammer, EPRI vice president
for exploratory research, would say how much money is involved.
   In another development, a scientist from the European laboratory
CERN said that a worldwide examination of attempts to duplicate
cold fusion shows there is little hope that it is real.
   Douglas Morrison, a self-described student of ``pathological
science,'' said that in most cases the experimenters found no
effect or found something early on but couldn't repeat it.
   Morrison, a physicist at the European Organization for Nuclear
Research in Geneva, was in Utah last week to visit with University
of Utah scientists. Pons and Fleischmann were in Japan and are not
expected to return until Thursday.
   Morrison said cold fusion fits the mold of other wrong
experiments in scientific history that appeared to hold huge
promise.
   ``It is normal when you have a wonderful dream to accept the
positive and suppress the negative,'' he said. ``Everyone does it.
Scientists are human, too.''
   Rossi said Morrison ``gave his talk as if the book has been
closed, and I think it's premature.''

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Discusses Budget and Economic Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with legislature today addressing whether
to put private businesses under more control; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Soviet today began a stormy debate on
the future of small private businesses that President Mikhail
Gorbachev says are facing an ultimatum from Soviet consumers upset
about price gouging.
   Gorbachev questioned why soap, for example, is sold by the
businesses for as much as $9 when it should sell for $1.50 or less.
   ``We have to take into account the mood of the people,'' he told
the legislature as it began debating proposed amendments that would
decentralize control of private firms and give local governments
more power to regulate them.
   The amendments were to be submitted to a legislative committee,
but both opponents and supporters of the private businesses, called
cooperatives, used the joint session to debate the enterprises'
future.
   The debate came a day after the Soviet government presented a
``crisis'' budget including a reduction in defense spending by more
than 8 percent and measures to cut the budget deficit in half.
   Gorbachev initiated legislation that beginning in 1987 allowed
individuals to set up small cooperative businesses to provide goods
and services the government-run economy could not.
   He said he stands by cooperatives for the innovation and
competition they can bring to the Soviet economy, but that price
gouging and corruption must be controlled because of public outrage.
   Several groups, including trade union activists and a group of
farmers who met with Gorbachev last weekend, are demanding a
crackdown on cooperatives, which charge prices that are not
regulated by the state.
   Deputy Veniamin Yarin of Nizhni Tagilsk said that cooperatives
engage in ``open robbery of the working man.''
   But Deputy Anatoly Sobchak, head of the law school at Leningrad
State University, said cooperatives in some areas were facing
wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring the law.
   Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, one of Gorbachev's closest
economic advisers, presented the amendments and told the deputies
that ``cooperatives are making the first step toward forming a
socialist market, which we have been talking about for so long.''
   Abalkin said problems that cause public outrage with
cooperatives actually are the problems of the entire Soviet
economy, such as severe shortages of basic goods and services.
   He said Soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an
important part of the economy, agree to treat them equally with
state-run business, and allow local governments to regulate them in
order to take into account local needs and viewpoints.
   Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov, who presented the 1990 budget
proposal on Monday, described the country's economic problems as a
``crisis.'' The Supreme Soviet's two-month session will consider
about 80 bills aimed at altering some long-time tenets of Soviet
politics.
   With a need to generate more revenues and cut expenses, the
Kremlin plans to implement a progressive income tax for Soviets
earning $1,076 a month _ more than three times the average worker's
wage _ and float a $92 billion bond issue, the nation's first
domestic offering, to help finance new construction, Pavlov told
the lawmakers.
   The 542-member bicameral Supreme Soviet, chaired by Gorbachev,
has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and discontent
caused by the demands of various ethnic groups and by the state-run
economy's failure to meet many Soviets' basic needs.
   The government's plan for the economy in 1990 calls for a
one-fifth increase in factory-made consumer goods, according to
Deputy Premier Lev Voronin.
   Pavlov said the government plan to cut military spending from
$119 billion to $109 billion is in keeping with the directive from
the Congress of People's Deputies to slash defense spending by 14
percent by 1991.

   Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers pulled
out of Cambodia today, rumbling across the border in aging trucks
and buses in what Hanoi says is the end of its involvement in the
decade-long war in Cambodia.
   Led by officers riding in a U.S.-made jeep and a string of
Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, the troops passed by
thousands of schoolchildren waving flags along Highway 1.
   The narrow, potholed road was one of the main routes from which
Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended nearly
four years of Khmer Rouge terror, installing a pro-Hanoi government.
   There is widespread fear that the Khmer Rouge, which from 1975
to 1978 sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to their death as
it tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune,
could fight its way back to power.
   In a radio report received today, Khmer Rouge guerrillas said
they captured two more positions in western Cambodia and killed or
wounded a number of Vietnamese soldiers.
   And in a message to his countrymen, Cambodian President Heng
Samrin today appealed to the army, the Communist Party and the
people to ``unite as a rock-like bloc'' to prevent the re-emergence
of the Khmer Rouge.
   In Ho Chi Minh City today, government officials said Vietnam and
Cambodia would renegotiate a ``peace and friendship'' treaty
imposed on the Cambodian government soon after it was installed.
   The treaty, in essence a mutual defense pact, conflicts with
Cambodia's stated goal of neutrality.
   The officials said Vietnamese arms shipments, military advice
and intelligence, will last as long as nations such as China and
Thailand continue to support the guerrilla resistance front.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach today urged a halt
to outside military support for Cambodia's warring factions in
order to avert a civil war.
   Vietnamese schools were closed to mark the troops' return, and
relatives of soldiers ran across the border at Moc Bai.
   ``I am so happy to be leaving Cambodia,'' said a soldier from
Can Tho province as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair.
   ``My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' said another
soldier as he held hands with his spouse. The young woman, dressed
up in a skirt and blouse, had sprinted the last few yards to
embrace her husband.
   In addition to the 10,000 troops crossing at Moc Bai, Vietnam
soldiers crossed over at port towns on the Mekong River and at
several other locations overland. In all, Vietnam said its last
26,000 troops were coming home today.
   Logistics and artillery divisions, along with wounded soldiers,
crossed the border at Samat, several miles north of Moc Bai. Tanks
and armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of Rach Gai.
   Outside of Moc Bai, villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer
the soldiers. Many waved Vietnamese flags. Some threw flowers to
the troops.
   ``Welcome home!,'' many people shouted.
   But many soldiers said they were worried about their future.
Vietnam has said it will demobilize many after the withdrawal, and
unemployment is high.
   For the past decade, tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have
been in Cambodia helping the Phnom Penh government battle a
coalition of guerrilla groups whose strongest faction is the Khmer
Rouge.
   Both the Hanoi and Pnom Penh governments hope the withdrawal
will convince countries to end economic and diplomatic boycotts
imposed after Vietnam's invasion.
   Phnom Penh's Premier Hun Sen says he also hopes the pullout will
persuade China and Thailand to stop aiding the three guerrilla
groups.
   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war will
continue,'' Hun Sen told reporters Sunday. ``As to the scope of the
war, we think it will depend on foreign countries,'' he said.
   The guerrillas have called the troop withdrawal a sham, and say
thousands of Vietnamese troops will remain, disguised as Cambodians.
   At a series of farewell ceremonies over the past six days in key
provincial towns, Cambodians cheered the departing troops and
praised the communist solidarity between the two neighboring
countries.
   Some Cambodians said they welcomed the withdrawal, while others
said they feared the Khmer Rouge, which has been on the offensive
as the Vietnamese withdraw.
   On Monday, in a report received today in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge
radio claimed its forces had captured two more positions in the
west, at Peam Ta and Toek Sok. The guerrillas also claim to have
captured ``a major strategic position'' on the road between the key
towns of Battambang and Pailin in western Cambodia.
   Pailin is the center of a remote ruby mining district near
Thailand, where the guerrilla groups are based.
   Western diplomats do not normally consider Khmer Rouge radio
reports reliable sources of information.
   Phnom Penh's defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged
the guerrillas have seized teritory near Pailin, but said the area
remained under government control.
   Cambodian officials have repeatedly assured reporters that they
are capable of fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese military
support, but concede that some Phnom Penh residents have begun
stocking rice and other staples in anticipation of a cut-off of
supplies to the capital.
   In 1975, Khmer Rouge forces encircled the city, forcing the
withdrawal of U.S. Embassy personnel on April 12 and the fall of
the U.S-backed Lon Nol government five days later.
   In the decade since Vietnam's invasion, the number of Khmer
Rouge troops has fallen from 170,000 to 17,000, Vietnamese army
officials say.

   Moslem militia chieftains today
criticized political reforms being considered by legislators and
warned that the fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war will
continue.
   A 3-day-old truce, which halted six months of fighting between
the Syrian army and Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun's forces, was
``generally holding'' with no serious violations, police said.
   Sporadic sniper fire crackled along Beirut's dividing Green
Line, but that has become a daily ritual.
   ``The military battle is not over yet and will not be finished
on the basis of a new sectarian compromise contained in the
committee's draft plan,'' declared Walid Jumblatt, leader of the
Syrian-backed Druse Moslem Progressive Socialist Party.
   His remarks, published by the independent An-Nahar daily,
reflected the hostility between Syria's Moslem and leftist allies
and the Christians who have long dominated Lebanon's political
system.
   Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri also criticized the
proposed reforms, which aim to split power equally, saying they
were ``not enough.''
   ``The constitution which they want to change gives us more than
the Arab committee's plan for reforms,'' he said.
   Berri did not elaborate. But he has been insisting that
Lebanon's 1.2 millin-strong Shiites, the country's largest sect,
should have a greater share of power than other sects.
   The remarks by Jumblatt and Berri underlined the fragility of
the cease-fire, brokered by an Arab League committee, that took
effect Saturday.
   The truce was part of a seven-point peace plan forged by King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and President
Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria in an effort to end the civil war that
has claimed more than 150,000 lives.
   The criticism came as Arab League mediator Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi,
an Algerian, met Christian legislators to discuss a planned meeting
by Lebanon's parliament in Saudi Arabia on Saturday on the proposed
political reforms.
   Ibrahimi, deputy secretary-general of the Arab League, later
told reporters: ``The ball's now in the legislators' court.''
   Legislator Jibran Taouk said Maronite deputies will ``announce
our stand on the reforms Wednesday after a meeting with Gen. Aoun.''
   Beirut's leftist As-Safir daily reported that Aoun was also
``exerting pressure on Christian parliamentary deputies prior to
their departure for Saudi Arabia.''
   Aoun, a Maronite, was believed to be pushing the Christian
deputies not to give too much away in Saudi Arabia.
   The venue was selected because it will allow the deputies to
discuss the reforms far from any pressure by the powerful militia
leaders.
   The militias do not have representatives in parliament, which
was elected in 1972. The civil war has prevented elections and the
House has regularly renewed its four-year mandate.
   A Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the warlords were ``upset because deep down they
don't want an end to the war.
   ``It gave them privileges which they'll lose the moment peace
prevails. A parliamentary meeting is stripping them of the
capability to steer events. That's why they're rejecting in advance
what we'll agree on in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   The Arab League peace plan calls for ending the Christians' 45
years of domination of Lebanon's political system.
   The Shiites, long downtrodden but now the most powerful Moslem
faction in Lebanon, in particular are demanding sweeping reforms
that would strip the Maronites of their privileges.
   At the Vatican today, Pope John Paul II issued the Vatican's
first formal appeal to Moslems and pleaded for their help in saving
Lebanon.
   ``Let your voices be heard, and even more, unite your efforts
with those who demand for Lebanon the right to live,'' the pope
said.
   The pontiff also said ``I firmly intend'' to go to Lebanon but a
Vatican spokesman said no immediate trip was planned.

<HEAD>Judge Says Midler Can't Sing in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors won't be treated to a Bette Midler
concert in her $10 million lawsuit against Ford Motor Co., but they
may hear her recordings, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima on Monday said Midler may
not sing in court at the trial, which will decide whether Ford and
the Young &amp; Rubicam ad agency used a ``sound-alike'' to impersonate
her in a 1985 car commercial.
   Lawyers for Ford and the ad agency sought the ruling, contending
that Midler might alter her voice in court to mimic the singer in
the commercial.
   Midler's lawyer, Peter Laird, said it hasn't been decided
exactly how her music will be presented to the jury.
   Young &amp; Rubicam hired a former backup singer for Midler to sing
``Do You Want to Dance'' in a Mercury Sable commercial after
Midler's manager turned down an opportunity for her to sing in the
TV ad, the court said.
   Midler, known to music fans as ``The Divine Miss M,'' sued in
1987.
   A judge threw out the case, saying the ad agency had acted like
``the average thief'' but broke no law. But an appeals court
reinstated the lawsuit last year, ruling that ``to impersonate her
voice is to pirate her identity.''
   The singer-actress recently has focused her talents on movie
roles in such films as ``Beaches,'' ``Outrageous Fortune'' and
``Big Business.''

<HEAD>Lake Liquidated in Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESHIRE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An entire lake has been liquidated, so to
speak, sold to two businessmen for $110,000 at a lakeside auction.
   The bidding for Hoosac Lake, a 120-year-old reservoir built to
provide water power for mills, was part of a bankruptcy proceeding
begun eight years ago by the now-defunct Arnold Print Works. The
sale is subject to court approval.
   The winning bid in Monday's auction, held on a causeway spanning
the 566-acre lake in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts,
was entered by Raymond Shea Jr. of Framingham and S. John Loscocco
of North Oxford.
   Shea said he and Loscocco own about half a dozen bodies of water
in central Massachusetts that are used mainly for recreation.
   ``We have an interest in water,'' Shea said. ``We haven't really
developed anything and we don't have any plans at this point to do
any developing.''
   Along with the lake, they get 50 acres on the shore.
   Some Cheshire residents were aprehensive about the sale, fearing
that a private owner might charge admission or erect large
developments.
   Some had hoped the auction would flop, proving the lake doesn't
have commercial potential and possibly opening the door for its
donation to the town or state. Cheshire had been paying $750 a year
to use the lake.
   Town officials had said the lake would be a bad buy because of
the cost of weeding, expected to be $31,000 this year, and because
of the age of its dam.
   The lake was created in the 1860s, when a group of manufacturers
bought land and dammed the Hoosac River to produce water power.
   In 1912 the Hoosac Reservoir Co. was formed to oversee
management of the water; Arnold Print Works was the last remaining

<HEAD>Police Patrols Doubled After Army Rangers in Gunfight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two days after a shootout between off-duty
soldiers and neighbors suspected of selling drugs, officials moved
to ease tension by holding a community meeting, doubling patrols
and calling in a Justice Department specialist.
   Army Sgt. Bill Foulk, whose neighborhood barbecue turned from an
anti-crime gathering into a 30-minute gunfight Saturday night,
maintained Monday that he and fellow members of an elite Rangers
unit acted in self-defense.
   ``They shot at us, and we fired back,'' he said, pointing at a
reputed crack house across the street.
   Police arrested two suspected gang members on assault and
weapons charges, confiscated guns including two semi-automatic
rifles from the Rangers and doubled patrols in the working-class
Hilltop neighborhood.
   No one was injured, but scuffles and brick-throwing followed on
Sunday between Rangers supporters and neighbors who said they were
being falsely accused of drug dealing.
   ``The hill is feeling such intensity right now,'' the Rev. David
Alger said Monday. ``These people up here need to be protected. I'm
surprised it escalated the way it did _ that's not what's meant by
community mobilization _ but on the other hand people are really
frightened.
   ``What we do now is the question.''
   Police Chief Ray Fjetland said the incident could have been
avoided had residents called police.
   Foulk said the gang members were upset that he was videotaping
their activities. He said he called additional Rangers to his party
when he felt threatened because police are too slow and equipped to
act only after violence begins.
   ``When somebody starts shooting at me and my family, I'm going
to shoot back,'' he said.
   A neighbor complained that racism was involved, prompting police
to call in a U.S. Justice Department community relations
investigator.
   ``The gang members are mostly black, and of course they want to
turn this into something racial,'' said Foulk, who is white. He
said the neighborhood anti-drug coalition is multiracial and no
racism was involved.
   Fellow Ranger Sgt. Russell Nolte, who is black, said four of the
Rangers involved in the shooting were black.
   Fjetland attended a Monday night community meeting organized by
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``We're seriously concerned about the way blacks are treated by
the police,'' said the Rev. Oscar Tillman, Tacoma chapter
president. He also criticized residents.
   ``You do not get trained soldiers using weapons of death in a
neighborhood that small and believe you're going to come out a
winner,'' he said.
   Foulk said the Rangers acted on their own time with their own
weapons. Army officials said they would await completion of a
police investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action is
warranted.
   But Maj. Clyde Newman, second-in-command of the 2nd Ranger
Battalion at nearby Fort Lewis, said that ``from everything I am
told by the city police, the Rangers were right. They were having a
party, and they were attacked.''

<HEAD>Slovenia Challenges Federal Authorities, Prepares to Vote on Secession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defiant Slovenian lawmakers set a
vote Wednesday on whether Yugoslavia's most liberal republic should
be allowed to secede, despite warnings that authorities could
impose a state of emergency.
   The Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee, the
Slovenian Central Committee and the federal parliament scheduled
emergency sessions today to discuss the political crisis sparked by
the proposed amendments to the republic's constitution.
   Slovenian lawmakers in the federal parliament said they would
boycott the Belgrade session.
   According to a proposed amendment, Slovenia would have a
``lasting and inalienable right to proclaim self-determination,
including the right of secession.''
   Another proposed amendment declares that Slovenian authorities
have the sole right to declare a state of emergency in the region
and to authorize the use of Yugoslav army units in the republic.
   Slovenia, which borders Italy, Austria and Hungary, is the most
prosperous and westward-looking of Yugoslavia's six constituent
republics. It has already allowed an unprecedented degree of
democratization, including the formation of several independent
political parties.
   Yugoslavia's state and communist party leadership has criticized
the amendments as being contrary to the federal constitution.
   The collective state presidency in charge of the armed forces
said Monday it will use all ``legal measures'' to prevent the
adoption of the amendments, indicating it might proclaim a state of
emergency in the northern republic.
   Slovenia's Central Committee said today, ``There are no
convincing reasons for delaying the adoption of the amendments nor
do they conflict with the Yugoslav constitution.''
   The Slovenian Communists said, according to the Tanjug news
agency, that the amendments ``do not represent a danger for the
future of Yugoslavia.''
   The Yugoslav federation is ``not being endangered by those
demanding additional guarantees for the respect of the equality and
sovereignty of its people.''
   A recent public opinion poll conducted in the republic said that
more than 70 percent of Slovenes favor the constitutional changes.
   Despite warnings by the eight-member presidency that the vote on
the changes must be postponed, Slovenian parliament President Miran
Potrc said he was certain the Slovenian legislature will adopt the
amendments.
   Meanwhile, an influential war veterans organaization in the
country's capital of Belgrade called for an urgent introduction of
emergency measures in Slovenia and for ``the arrest of all those
responsible'' for the amendments, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper
said.

   Joe R. Robinowitz, general manager of WFXT-TV
in Boston and former editor of the Boston Herald, has been named
national editor of TV Guide.
   ``I'm delighted to be back in print journalism, particularly
with such a prestigious magazine, which brings both worlds
together,'' Robinowitz said.
   The appointment was announced Monday by News America Publishing
Inc., the Rupert Murdoch company that bought TV Guide from Walter
H. Annenberg last year. The weekly has two co-editors, one for
national coverage and one for local sections.
   Robinowitz, 38, succeeds David Sendler, who resigned Sept. 14
over what he said were editorial differences with Murdoch.
   Robinowitz was assistant managing editor in charge of developing
a Sunday newspaper for the New York Post and, from 1982 to 1986,
was editor of the Herald.
   Murdoch owns the Herald, agreed last week to sell WFXT and owned
the Post until last year.
   TV Guide is the most widely read magazine in the nation, with
circulation estimated by Robinowitz at 16 million a week.

   Truckloads of ice, plastic sheeting,
bottled water other necessities are beginning to arrive from the
outside world as a few services return to communities shattered by
Hurricane Hugo.
   Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic today in
sunny but cool weather, and residents were advised Monday that the
city's water supply is safe to drink without boiling.
   The storm, which rammed the coast Thursday night with winds of
135 mph and torrential rain, left at least $3 billion in damage,
state officials said.
   Hugo killed 33 people as it rampaged through the Carribean; 28
deaths on the U.S. mainland are blamed on the hurricane and its
remnants.
   Two inches of rain Monday fell on Charleston, and there was an
80 percent chance of showers today, the National Weather Service
said.
   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to
make everything a little more miserable,'' said Kay Robinson, of
the weather service.
   Offers of outside help have begun to arrive.
   A Maryland business sent two truckloads of ice Monday to help
residents who have no electricity to refrigerate food. The ice from
the Berlin Ice Co. was delivered in tractor-trailers by the Perdue
chicken company.
   The Mississippi Department of Agriculture will set up a food
stand Thursday, offering a ton of fried catfish, hush puppies and
French fries.
   Truckloads of plastic sheeting, blankets, trash bags, diapers,
tools, bottled water and other necessities were sent by Wal-Mart
stores, said spokeswoman Brenda Lockhart at the company's
Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.
   ``We still have our sleeves rolled up,'' she said Monday.
``We'll find out what needs to be done and react accordingly.''
   Utility companies across the South offered to send crews to help
restore service to the thousands of homes and businesses blacked by
the storm.
   More than 150 workers from the Florida Power &amp; Light Co. were on
the job or on the way, said spokesman Dale Thomas.
   Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in the
Carolinas, but at least 546,000 remained without service, according
to utility company officials. It could be a month before full
service is restored.
   Power has been restored to about 5 percent of Charleston
customers, including hospitals.
   Commerce is picking up on Broad Street in the heart of the
Historic District, where some stores and restaurants used emergency
generators Monday to power cooking and lighting.
   A few banks reopened, and some automatic-teller machines have
sprung to life _ a godsend in a city where cash has become scarce.
   At the Citizens and Southern National Bank Monday, customers
with checks to cash lined up under four light bulbs strung from a
wire hooked to a generator. Tellers phoned transactions to banks in
other parts of the state to record the information on computers,
said John Jordan, senior vice president.
   Down the street at Charleston City Hall, volunteers manned a
bank of phones set up as part of a nationwide relief effort.
   The city needs everything from canned goods and bread to
building supplies, generators and roofing nails, said Mayor Joseph
P. Riley.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell announced the state would hire some of the
estimated 224,000 workers displaced by the storm to help with
cleanup efforts.
   President Bush expanded his earlier disaster declaration to
include four North Carolina counties. He already declared seven
South Carolina counties as disaster areas. The declaration frees
federal assistance and eases the way to getting loans for repairs.
   Seventeen Navy ships and five freighters were at anchor off the
Charleston Harbor waiting to return today, said Anne Moise,
spokeswoman for the State Ports Authority.
   The port was closed Friday after tidal surge destroyed or
displaced navigational buoys and caused shoaling within the
channel. The Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers were checking
for dangerous debris, and will completely reopen the harbor once it
is found safe and all the buoys are replaced, she said.
   The port, the second largest on the East and Gulf coasts,
sustained millions of dollars in damage and lost business as ships
were diverted to other ports, officials said.
   The Corps also began work on a temporary pontoon bridge to link
devastated Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island to the mainland once
again, but the coastal resort of Garden City remained closed and
guarded by troops against looters. The bridge to the Isle of Palms
and Sullivan's Island was wiped out by the storm.
   Residents on Monday were ferried to the Isle of Palms for brief
looks at their property, and were allowed to collect one suitcase
each of belongings.
   ``On a normal day, this was like being in heaven,'' resident
Paul Traywick said after getting his first post-storm look at the
island. ``It's not like that any more,'' Traywick said. ``Not for a
long time.''

<TEXT>
   An AIDS patient advocacy group says it will
import a widely prescribed AIDS drug because the U.S. manufacturer
is overcharging for it, an accusation the company strongly denies.
   ``Today we fight business with business,'' Derek Hodel, director
of the People With AIDS Health Group, said Monday. He charged that
the drug, pentamidine, is priced now for ``the privileged few.''
   Hodel said his organization, a self-described ``guerrilla
drugstore,'' is arranging purchases of pentamidine in England at
less than half the U.S. price. The group hopes to pressure the
American maker to lower its price here.
   A spokesman for the U.S. manufacturer, Lyphomed Inc. of
Rosemont, Ill., said its price was appropriate given what the
company spent on research, and said importation of the drug
probably violates federal law.
   PWA Health Group maintained its action is legal.
   The Food and Drug Administration is investigating, a spokesman
said.
   AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease. There is no
cure, but some drugs have been shown to help AIDS patients live
longer. One of the best known, AZT, has also been the focus of
criticism from AIDS activists who say it is overpriced.
   Pentamidine, inhaled as an aerosol, helps ward off a form of
pneumonia that is the leading cause of death for AIDS patients.
   Lyphomed sells monthly doses wholesale for $99.45, and
pharmacies mark that up to $105 and more. In Europe, a version
produced by a French company, Rhone-Poulenc, sells for about $30
per monthly dose retail. PWA Health Group said it can fill U.S.
prescriptions abroad at a retail cost of $40 per dose, including
handling.
   Lyphomed spokesman Stuart Fischer said the drug is profitable,
but he would not give figures. He said the company spent $20
million testing it and developing the procedure by which it is
inhaled rather than injected.
   No other manufacturer was willing to do that, he said.
   ``When the chips were down, Lyphomed was there,'' Fischer said.
``Yes, the drug is profitable. But we are not profiteers.''
   He said Lyphomed agreed to research pentamidine in the early
1980s when the FDA, concerned about erratic supply, sought a U.S.
manufacturer. The FDA granted Lyphomed an exclusive license for
seven years beginning in 1984.
   Dr. Bernard Bihari, an AIDS specialist who joined the PWA Health
Group at its announcement, called Lyphomed's price for the drug
unconscionable.
   ``It's a wonderful treatment, a very effective one _ a
lifesaving treatment,'' Bihari said. ``And for anything to
interfere with the availability of that lifesaving treatment is
unacceptable.''
   PWA Health Group chiefly helps AIDS patients buy personal
supplies of prescription drugs that are legal abroad but not
licensed for sale in this country. Such purchases are allowed by
the FDA so long as the drugs are not bogus or dangerous.
   The group helps fill prescriptions for several hundred people,
mostly in the New York metropolitan area, with sales of about $1
million last year.
   The importation of pentamidine is the first case in which the
group has imported a drug that is already sold here.
   PWA Health Group said virtually everyone diagnosed with AIDS may
be put on pentamidine at some point to help prevent pneumonia. The
group said it hopes to to supply the drug to several thousand
people, mostly in the metropolitan area.
   Federal authorities report that more than 100,000 people have
been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States, about 40,000 of whom
are still alive. They estimate that more than 250,000 people will
have been diagnosed with AIDS by the end of 1991.

<TEXT>
   The author of legislation virtually
eliminating congressional mass mailings and using the savings for
drug treatment programs criticized House-Senate negotiators today
for their decision to drop the measure.
   ``That is a disgrace,'' Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., told his
colleagues on the Senate floor.
   Wilson, who is running for governor of California next year and
hopes to leave the Senate, complained that federal aid for drug
treatment programs ``is not remotely sufficient.'' He said
lawmakers' refusal to transfer funds from mailings to drug efforts
is a signal to the public that as far as Congress is concerned,
``Our first priority is ourselves.''
   The decision Monday by a House-Senate conference committee to
save the mailings was an embarrassing about-face for the House.
Only two hours before, in a non-binding 245-137 vote, the House
instructed its conference members to back Senate language virtually
ending the free mailings.
   The conferees accepted a compromise to continue the mailings,
but drop the number from six annually to three. The proposal was
introduced by Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who pronounced the House
vote a fraud as soon as it ended.
   ``This was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it
was a vote to ... pose for holy pictures,'' he said. ``It's pure
demagoguery but it's great politics.''
   In the conference, however, Fazio and Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
saved their wrath for the Senate for starting the anti-free mailing
campaign on Sept. 7. At the time, senators voted 83-8 for an
amendment to ban all newsletters, town meeting notices and mailings
to more than 500 households _ 95 percent of the mass mailings,
according its sponsor, Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Fazio told Senate conferees Harry Reid, D-Nev. and Don Nickles,
R-Okla. that senators wanted the House to ``do your dirty work,''
by saving the mass mailings after senators went on record as
opposing the newsletters.
   Reid accepted the compromise to continue the mailings on a
reduced scale. Nickels opposed the move, but no formal conference
vote was taken once he admitted that Fazio's compromise would pass.
   The conferees must now submit their proposal separately to the
House and Senate, each of which would face the possibility of an
embarrassing reversal. The bill approved by the conferees would
appropriate $1.9 billion to run Congress in the next fiscal year.
   Wilson sought to transfer the estimated $45 million in savings
from the anti-mailing plan to a treatment program for pregnant
women addicted to drugs.
   Fazio said he was angry the Senate tried to meddle in House
affairs by controlling the mailings of both chambers, and Obey
threatened future amendments to change Senate rules, which are far
less strict in the use of campaign money for office expenses.
   ``They want to keep their slush funds while posing for
headlines,'' Obey said of senators.
   Obey said the Senate used the same tactic earlier this year, by
overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed 51 percent pay raise for
Congress, while secretly counting on the House to pass an increase.
The pay plan collapsed.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who offered the House resolution on
mailings to follow the Senate's lead, said he would refuse to sign
the conference report because ``We gave away the store.''
   Conte, documenting what he called abuses of mass mailings, said
that in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended about a month before
congressional elections, the cost of House newsletters rose
steadily as the election approached _ from $5.9 million the first
quarter to $16 million in the last quarter. Senate mass mailings
rose from $3.8 million in the first quarter to $10 million in the
fourth quarter.
   ``We really created a Frankenstein,'' Conte said. ``The only way
we're going to free ourselves from this monster is to cut its head
off ... and use it for something worthwhile.''
   The language on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail
accounts: $54.5 million, or 65 percent of the total, for the
435-member House; and $29.3 million, or 35 percent, for the
100-member Senate. In addition, the provision calls for $31.7
million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989.
   Currently, there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year,
but they would be reduced to three beginning next Jan. 1. There
would be a two-sheet limit.

<TEXT>
   Investigators believe they have found traces of a
powerful plastic explosive in the wreckage of a French DC-10
airliner that exploded over the Niger desert, two French newspapers
reported today.
   The dailies Liberation and Le Parisien said the discovery
strengthened the link between last week's UTA crash and the
December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The news accounts, quoting unidentified sources involved in the
inquiry, said the presence of Semtex, a malleable and
difficult-to-detect explosive made in Czechoslovakia, still had to
be confirmed by laboratory tests in Paris.
   Liberation reported the explosive may have been hidden in a
shipment of farm chemicals put on the plane in Brazzaville, Congo,
where it originated.
   The plane disappeared less than an hour after takeoff following
a stopover in N'Djamena, Chad. All 171 people aboard were killed.
   French investigators have said it appears certain an ``explosive
substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the crash but have
not elaborated publicly on what explosive may have been used.
   The parallels between last week's crash and the Dec. 21
Lockerbie disaster have already been widely noted.
   It is believed that a radio-cassette player rigged with Semtex
was placed aboard the Pan Am flight in Frankfurt that made a change
of planes in London before the explosion.
   The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command is considered the prime suspect behind
that attack, though the group's leader Ahmed Jibril has denied
involvement.
   Police in West Germany seized an air pressure-activated bomb
hidden in a radio when they raided houses and apartments occupied
by suspected radical Palestinians in October last year.
   A British television inquiry into the Flight 103 bombing said
Monday that West Germany committed major blunders, including
releasing the probable bomb-maker after the October raid.
   The British Broadcasting Corp.'s current affairs program
``Panorama'' said investigators are convinced Jibril's group
masterminded the attack.
   West German authorities arrested 16 men in the October raid but
released 14 of them, including a Jordanian, Marwan Khreesat.
``Panorama'' said Khreesat is widely believed to have made the
Lockerbie bomb and several others.
   Asked why Khreesat was released, Hans-Juergen Foerster,
spokesman for the West German prosecutor's office, said Monday,
``He was released because there was no urgent suspicion of his
connection with a crime.''
   Claims of responsibility for the UTA crash from anonymous
callers in Beirut and London on behalf of the Moslem extremist
group Islamic Jihad and a previously unknown Chadian organization
have not been authenticated. French police appear to be treating
the claims with great skepticism.
   On Monday, Investigating Magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguieres, an
anti-terrorism specialist heading the criminal investigation,
officially called on the DST, France's counterespionage police, to
aid in the probe, judicial sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bruguieres
made a specific written request to the Direction de la Surveillance
du Territoire for assistance. The sources said they did not know
exactly what tasks the agency's officers were called on to
undertake.

<TEXT>
   Letter carriers here have agreed to pay
25 cents out of their own pockets for each misdelivered piece of
mail.
   The bounty will be paid to residents of this Columbus suburb who
return the wrongly delivered letters.
   ``We're calling it the Worthington Letter Carriers Money Back
Guarantee,'' Michael Newman, a Postal Service spokesman in
Columbus, said today.
   The 60-day trial program along 11 routes is an outgrowth of a
national, voluntary program by the Postal Service and the National
Association of Letter Carriers.
   ``We wanted to indicate to our customers that we were concerned
about getting their mail delivered to them properly, and we wanted
to make sure that we were going to do everything we could in order
to do that,'' Newman said.
   Newman said a similar program in High Point, N.C., operated for
about a year and paid out $26.
   Under the program, which began Monday, carriers will pay for any
misdelivered first-class items that had been properly addressed.
   Customers will be given a form to fill out and an envelope in
which to return the misdelivered mail at no cost.
   About 3,000 to 5,000 customers will be involved in the project
   Newman said the the union would pay for misdeliveries by
part-time or substitute carriers.

   Suspected Communist rebels today
killed two Americans near a U.S. military base shortly before Vice
President Dan Quayle arrived for a visit to discuss the future of
U.S. bases here, officials said.
   Six unidentified gunmen firing from a passenger jeep killed the
pair at about 5 p.m. in Capas, about 60 miles north of Manila, said
Col. Florentino Amorabon, spokesman for the Philippine Constabulary
in central Luzon.
   The names of the two were withheld. In Washington, a Pentagon
statement said the two were civilian employees of Ford Aerospace
Corp., a contractor at Camp O'Donnell, a U.S.-run facility about 50
miles north of Manila and 12 miles from the U.S. Clark Air Base.
   A Pentagon spokesman said the names of the dead were being held
until relatives could be identified.
   The Americans' car had been blocked by a dump truck and the
jeep. The gunmen jumped out of the jeep, sprayed their car with
semi-automatic weapons fire and then opened the car door and fired
into the victims' bodies, said Lt. Pepito Pimentel, station
commander of the Capas police.
   The military believes the assailants were Communist rebels, who
operate in the Clark area, Amorabon said.
   In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James Rowe as he was
driving to the headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military Assistance
Group in Quezon City. In October 1987, rebels killed three
Americans in simultaneous attacks outside Clark Air Base.
   Also today, suspected Communist rebels killed a captain from
President Corazon Aquino's guard force in an ambush about one mile
southeast of where the president will hold talks with Quayle on
Wednesday.
   As Quayle arrived today on a three-day visit, hundreds of
leftists burned his effigy and an American flag while chanting
``Bases out!, Quayle go home!''
   Quayle made no statement as he arrived at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport from Japan, where he ended a six-day visit
with a short stop on Okinawa, an island that was a major World War
II battlefield and today is home for more than 35,000 U.S. troops.
   Before boarding a U.S. Air Force flight to Manila, the third leg
of his Asian tour, the vice president called his Japan visit
positive and said it helped strengthen the two nations' ``global
partnership.''
   Quayle's talks in the Philippines were to focus on the future of
Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations, the leases of which expire in September 1991.
   The left-wing League of Filipino Students and the May First
Movement, a militant labor confederation, have announced plans for
demonstrations during the vice president's visit.
   Nine policemen were injured and nine students were arrested
today when security forces broke up a rally at Manila's Adamson
University, officials said.
   Despite the security, about 150 members of the League of
Filipino Students and the Youth for Nationalism and Democracy
reached the airport terminal a few hours before Quayle arrived.
   Protesters shouted ``Quayle go home, bases out!'' and ``Yankees
go home!'' They carried banners reading ``Quayle visit _ a curse.''
   After negotiations with police, the group agreed to withdraw
about a half mile away along the main road into the city. Police
estimated the crowd grew to nearly 1,000 by the time Quayle arrived.
   Police and troops in the capital also were on alert because of a
series of bombings in Manila that have killed two people and
injured 16 since Sept. 16.
   Early today, suspected rebels killed Capt. Carlos Daileg, a
staff officer of the Presidential Security Group, in an ambush in
the city's Pandacan district. He was the fourth member of the
presidential guard slain in the past four months.
   On Monday, Acting Foreign Secretary Manuel Yan said Quayle was
bringing a letter from President Bush believed to include a
proposal to begin talks on extending the lease on the U.S. bases.
   Mrs. Aquino has offered new talks but refuses to say whether she
will support an extension. Any new agreement must be ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to
the bases is strong.
   About 40,000 U.S. troops, military depedents and civilian
employees are stationed at the bases, among the largest U.S.
military facilities overseas.
   Quayle is to visit Clark and Subic on Wednesday. On Thursday,
Quayle travels to Corregidor island, where U.S. and Filipino troops
battled Japanese invaders during World War II, before leaving for
Malaysia.
   In October, U.S. and Filipino negotiators agreed to allow the
bases to remain until 1991 in return for $431 million a year in
U.S. aid. American officials say they are not prepared to pay
substantially more to keep the bases.
   In Tokyo on Monday, Quayle said he discussed with Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu a letter from Bush requesting more Japanese support
in the war against illicit drugs.

   A bomb exploded early today across the
street from the U.S. Embassy, shattering windows in the compound
and several other downtown buildings and slightly injuring an
embassy security guard, authorities said.
   The bomb was planted in a sidewalk garbage can in front of the
U.S. Embassy and 150 yards from the presidential palace, a police
officer said. The narrow downtown street is lined by shops and
offices.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   A Chilean security guard for the embassy who was at the building
entrance suffered minor injuries in the blast, said a spokeswoman
for the embassy, Sonja Sweek.
   The man was taken to a hospital, treated and released, she said.

   Urine samples taken two days after a USAir jet
skidded into the East River contained no sign of drug or alcohol
use by the pilot or co-pilot, prosecutors say.
   The test results were made public by the office of Queens
District Attorney John J. Santucci on Monday, the same day he
announced that a grand jury would look into the crash that killed
two people last week.
   Tests on samples taken from the pilot and co-pilot on Friday
showed no evidence of drugs such as cocaine, heroin or
amphetamines, or alcohol, said Santucci spokesman Richard Piperno.
Results of similar tests by the National Transportation Safety
Board will not be available for several weeks.
   The captain, Michael W. Martin, and co-pilot, Constantine
Kleissas, were criticized by federal officials for failing to
submit to testing immediately after the crash, although they are
not legally required to do so.
   Medical experts said alcohol would not normally show up in urine
samples taken two days after ingestion but that traces of drugs
such as marijuana or cocaine probably would.
   The test means ``that they were free of drugs and or alcohol at
the time that the sample was taken,'' Piperno said today.
   The jet, en route to Charlotte, N.C., skidded into the East
River after the crew tried to abort takeoff at LaGuardia Airport on
Wednesday.
   Investigators said the co-pilot reported he inadvertently
punched a button that cut the throttle, and the pilot told
officials that he aborted takeoff because of a vibration and
because the jet began to veer for some reason.
   The pilots' lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, said the results ``come as
no surprise. We had fully anticipated they would be negative, and
indeed people's observations of the pilots on the night of the
flight was totally consistent with their being in full control of
themselves.''
   Piperno said he also knew of no evidence indicating the men were
under the influence at the time of the crash.
   In announcing the criminal investigation, Santucci said he had
no prospective targets and would not seek specific criminal
charges. Among the things the grand jury would investigate was how
the crew was picked for the flight, he said.
   The two men, flying together for the first time, had been chosen
from a pool of pilots with the least seniority. The co-pilot, who
had flown a Boeing 737-400 only once before on a regular passenger
flight, was attempting his first takeoff in that model with
passengers aboard. Both pilots had been working about 12 hours.
   Santucci's decision to investigate is unusual, if not
unprecedented, airline insiders said.
   ``We're not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being
brought here in the United States against an airline pilot''
following a crash, said John Macor, a spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association in Washington.
   Hafetz said he had no comment on the investigation.
   Charges that a grand jury might be asked to consider include
criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and leaving
the scene of an accident, according to sources in Santucci's office
who requested anonymity.
   An airplane is considered a vehicle under New York law.

   Jurors at Jim Bakker's fraud trial
watched videotapes of Bakker's TV show today, including one in
which ``Love Boat'' captain Gavin MacLeod said God had saved his
marriage.
   The jurors saw a 1985 show on which MacLeod and his wife, Patty,
discussed how their Christian faith allowed them to remarry three
years after they divorced. Bakker and his wife, Tammy, also
discussed their marital problems.
   MacLeod began crying when he was introduced by Bakker, saying,
``I don't think I've stopped crying since I came to the Lord.''
   Bakker talked about how many Hollywood stars have appeared on
PTL shows.
   ``What is God doing?'' he asked. ``He won't leave you alone. God
wants to take Hollywood.''
   Bakker said he and Tammy had experienced their own marital
problems. ``Tammy said `Jim, I don't love you anymore.' And I said,
`I don't love you anymore, either,''' he said, adding that they
were able to save their marriage because of their strong faith.
   ``What these people are saying is real,'' Bakker said. ``Our
marriage died and their marriage died. Sure, we still have
problems. But to get to heaven, you have to have had problems.''
   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by using more than
$3.7 million in ministry money to live in style. He faces up to 120
years in prison and more than $5 million in fines if convicted on
all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   On Monday, a former builder for Bakker testified that the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, who took over PTL after Bakker resigned in a sex and
money scandal, offered Bakker a $300,000 annual salary for life and
other perks to keep quiet.
   Defense attorney George T. Davis never asked Messner what Bakker
was supposed to keep quiet about. It was not clear whether Bakker
turned down the alleged offer. Roe Messner, tstifying for the
defense, was not questioned further about the matter.
   But a Falwell spokesman said Bakker had asked for the money and
perks.
   Messner also said a PTL official claimed Bakker knew nothing
about $265,000 in hush money paid to Jessica Hahn, the church
secretary with whom Bakker had a sexual encounter in 1980.
   Messner testified that Falwell sent him to Palm Springs, Calif.,
in May 1987 to offer Bakker a deal: the $300,000 salary, a maid, a
security guard, health insurance and telephone expenses ``if he
kept his mouth shut.''
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, jotted down the offer on a piece of her
pink stationery, and Bakker wrote at the bottom: ```I'm not making
any demands on PTL. I'm not asking for anything,''' according to
Messner.
   Falwell, founder of the now-defunct Moral Majority, denied
Messner's account.
   The offer actually was a demand from Bakker, said Falwell's
spokesman, Mark DeMoss, in a telephone interview.
   DeMoss said Falwell did dispatch Messner to Palm Springs to talk
to Bakker, but he carried no offer. DeMoss said Messner returned
with a handwritten list of demands on the Mrs. Bakker's stationery.
   DeMoss said Bakker's demands included hospital insurance, a
$300,000 annual salary for life, a $100,000 annual salary for life
for his wife, royalties on inspirational books and recordings made
by the Bakkers, secretary and maid service for a year, use of a
South Carolina lakefront house and furniture and attorneys' fees.
   Messner, who testified that he handled the $265,000 payment to
Ms. Hahn, also said that at a Feb. 21, 1985, lunch, PTL Executive
Vice President Richard Dortch told him: ```I'm going to ask you to
do a big favor. I'm asking you because I know you'll keep it
confidential.'''
   Dortch told Messner that if he didn't pay a woman from New York
$265,000, then she would go to The Charlotte Observer with
allegations that Bakker raped her. Five days later, Messner said,
he wired the $265,000 to an account number in California that was
given to him by Dortch.
   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment,
and Dortch replied: ```No, I'm acting on my own.'''
   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because the
Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuit
threatened by Ms. Hahn.
   ``I didn't think the church ought to be dragged into this
incident,'' Messner said.

   Officers used tear gas to quell a jail riot
early today and then negotiated an end to a standoff with 150 other
inmates who barricaded themselves in their dorms with piled-up
furniture, officials said.
   Six officers and six inmates were taken to a hospital as a
precaution, but no serious injuries were reported in the uprising
at the 2,700-inmate jail on Rikers Island, said Correction
Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.
   The damage was being assessed this morning, she said.
   About 50 inmates set fires and blockaded their dorm with
mattresses, complaining that one of two men removed earlier from
the unit for fighting had been unfairly punished, said Ryles.
   About 3 a.m., officers used tear gas to end the uprising, but
some 150 prisoners in three other dormitories barricaded themselves
in for more than an hour by piling up beds, chairs, tables and
other items, the spokeswoman said.

   More than 75 hospital workers suffered food

   Jordan University Hospital's deputy director, Hussam

the staff ate lunch.
   ``We don't know if the food was poisoned and we can't determine
that until after labaratory results,'' Muhtaseb told The Associated

   He said hospital officials suspect the cause was bad frozen meat
served at the hospital, ``and the proof is that all reported cases
had their lunch meal here.''
   Muhtaseb said more than 75 people suffered symptoms of food
poisoning but that none was in serious condition. No patients were
affected.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Embassy officials trying to curtail a
constant line outside the embassy on Tuesday announced new rules on
emigration procedures aimed at lightening the work load in Moscow
and limiting the number of would-be emigrants.
   The announcement was made to an agitated crowd of several
hundred Soviets, who were gathered around the embassy seeking
permission to emigrate or visit the United States. Dozens pushed
and grabbed for the one-sheet explanation of the rules, which take
effect Oct. 1.
   According to the document, applications for emigration now will
have to be sent to Washington instead of being dealt with in Moscow
because of the flood of requests pouring into the embassy here.
   Lines of hundreds of people have been forming around the embassy
every day since Soviet officials began liberalizing emigration
policies last year. There have been reports recently that spaces in
line are going for hundreds of dollars.
   ``The United States will continue to receive applications from
all interested Soviet citizens, but priority in scheduling
interviews will be given to those with close relatives ... who are
citizens or legal residents of the United States, as well as those
of special concern to the United States,'' according to the
document handed out Tuesday.
   ``Many who have no close family ties in the United States will
face long delays and may wish to explore alternative destinations.
Not all those who apply will be given appointments,'' it warned.
   Soviets will be notified by mail from Washington if they are to
be interviewed in the embassy in Moscow.
   Soviets using Israeli visas _ mostly Jews _ will not be able to
apply for entrance to the United States in Rome or Vienna if their
Soviet exit visa is dated after Oct. 1, the document said. Many
Soviet Jews are waiting in those cities for admission to the United
States instead of going to Israel.
   The Geneva-based International Commission for Migration said
more than 30,000 Soviet Jews had arrived at its transit point in
Vienna from January through August.
   The head of the Soviet visa office, Rudolf Kuznetsov, said on
Aug. 22 that 200,000 Soviets are expected to emigrate this year.
Besides the United States, many want to go to West Germany. About
50,000 people, mostly ethnic Germans, had left for West Germany by
the end of August.
   A senior U.S. official in Moscow said earlier this month that
the embassy had received 10,000 new applications in August alone,
adding to a backlog of 32,000 cases.
   ``The number of people applying to go to the states is
skyrocketing and going far beyond the cap on refugees,'' he said.
``The great majority of people leaving cannot qualify under the law
to be refugees ... and most are not claiming to be refugees.''
   Compared to 1988, when 85 percent to 90 percent of the
applicants were Armenians, in August 45 percent of the applicants
were Jews, 35 percent were Armenians, and 10 percent were Russians,
he said. He said 70 percent of the Russians had no relatives at all
in the United States.
   A U.S. official said the embassy will monitor the list of
interviews granted by Washington and the number of people who
appear for an interview to determine whether the Soviet mail system
can be trusted to deliver notification.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today adopted liberal laws
that guarantee free travel abroad and emigration, the first of a
sweeping set of changes intended transform Communist Hungary into a
multi-party democracy.
   The new laws lifted most restrictions on travel, meaning that
Hungarians no longer require permission from authorities for
foreign travel or emigration.
   Hungary's liberal policies in this respect were demonstrated by
a government decision in May to begin removing barbed wire fencing
and other obstacles on its border with Austria.
   This Warsaw Pact country also allowed thousands of East Germans
seeking to emigrate to the West to cross legally into Austria,
angering its hard-line allies.
   The session that opened today is to decide a series of key bills
that are to pave the way for next year's elections in June, the
first free and open multi-party balloting in more than 40 years of
Communist rule.
   The volume of legislation prompted lawmkers to vote for an
extension of the session in October after a two-week break to allow
lawmakers to study the draft laws. The current session was
originally scheduled to end Friday.
   Legislators will have to vote on six key bills, including one on
the functioning of political parties, a new electoral law, the
establishment of a constitutional court and changes in the penal
code.
   The legislators today approved membership of four opposition
members who received a majority at recent by-elections, marking the
first time members of the opposition took their seats in the
Communist-dominated assembly.
   Gabor Roszik, the first opposition member elected in July, was
accompanied to the Parliament building by supporters waving flags.
   ``Democracy has returned to Parliament after a 40-year exile,''
Roszik told the house.
   ``This is one of the most significant steps of the revolution
underway in Hungary, as we move from dictatorial socialism to
democracy,'' Roszik said. ``The millions of Hungarians have never
paid such close attention to our work as they do now.''
   The bills before Parliament this week are designed to bring
legislation in line with preparations for the multi-party
elections, which would be the first since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   More than 70 percent of the 387 members of Parliament are
Communists. So-called independent candidates elected after 1985
when Hungary instituted multi-candidate elections had to be
approved by a Communist-affiliated organization.
   Parliament is also expected to discuss the creation of a post of
president which would replace the current 21-man collective
presidency, and determine the date and form of his election.
   There has been considerable pressure for the president to be
elected before the end of the year to provide political stability
during the transition phase before the elections.
   Hungary, like Warsaw Pact ally Poland, has embraced and in fact
exceeded the liberal reforms and progressive politics encouraged by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Both nations are seeking closer trade and investment ties to the
West to improve their economies as they pursue social reforms,
moves that have alienated them from such hard-line Warsaw Pact
nations as East Germany and Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Burma Sentences Five to Death for Beheadings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military tribunal in Burma has
sentenced five people to death for beheading three people they
wrongly suspected of poisoning drinking water during last year's
pro-democracy uprising, state radio said.
   Rangoon Radio said in a broadcast Monday that two men and one
woman were beheaded at the junction of U Wisara and Shwedagon
Pagoda Roads in Rangoon ``during last year's disturbances.''
   ``The victims were falsely accused of poisoning drinking
water,'' the radio said.
   The report, received in Bangkok on Tuesday, did not give the
date of the incident. But Western news reports at the the time
described the beheadings on Sept. 8 last year, when crowds of up to
a million paraded through Rangoon demanding an end to years of
authoritarian rule.
   Rangoon Radio said the tribunal heard that Ma May Khine ``kicked
the woman accused of poisoning the water and barbarously severed
(her) head.'' Another defendant, Aye Cho, used a sword to behead
one of the men, it said.
   Two others, Nan Lwin and Shwe Toe, helped with the killings and
helped hang the severed heads on a signboard at the road junction,
the report said.
   The fifth convicted, Po Lu, also assisted in the murders,
``posed for pictures with the severed heads, tied one on a bamboo
pole and displayed it by marching along ... and helped burn the
corpses,'' the radio said.
   At the end of last month, a military tribunal in northwestern
Burma sentenced 11 people to death for beheading four policemen,
also during the uprising.
   Last year's demonstrations were crushed after a series of bloody
army clampdowns in which thousands were killed.
   The government has used the sporadic violence that occurred
during the largely peaceful protests to justify its use of force
against dissent, saying the country was on the verge of anarchy. It
continues to rule by martial law.
   Some dissidents have blamed the violence and rumors _ such as
those surrounding the poisoning of drinking water _ on
government-paid provocateurs.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon say several thousand pro-democracy
activists have been arrested since opposition leaders Aung San Suu
Kyi and Tin Oo were placed under house arrest July 19.

   Handicapped people demanding wheelchair lifts on
public buses blocked entrances to a federal building for a second
day today after President Bush let them spend the night rather than
send them out into the rain.
   Two officials of the Urban Mass Transit Administration arrived
with a third, unidentified official just before noon today to meet
with protest leaders.
   But the 80 or so demonstrators, many in wheelchairs, made good
on a vow to block entrances of the main level of the Richard B.
Russell building at noon if their demands were not met.
   The activists began the demonstration Monday, when at least two
dozen chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their
wheelchairs.
   ``This is a real national effort and we want people to know
about it,'' said Marca Bristo, 36, of Chicago, one of the protest
organizers.
   The demonstrators want a federal order requiring all new public
buses bought with federal funds to be equipped with wheelchair
lifts. Government officials have estimated this would cost $90
million a year.
   Bush intervened Monday night after authorities ejected several
protesters and organizers said they would continue demonstrating
outside, in a cold downpour.
   Gary Cason, regional administrator for the General Services
Administration, said the president ordered that the demonstrators
be brought in out of the rain.
   ``He's concerned about their plight and their safety,'' Cason
said.
   But protest organizer Mike Auberger of Denver, Colo., said his
group, American Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation,
would step up the protest to dispel the notion that Bush is openly
addressing their demands.
   ``The administration, up to now, was willing to throw us out. If
we don't do something, they'll just let us sit here,'' Auberger
said.
   ``We're going to close it back down again. They need to know our
issue isn't going away.''
   ADAPT members are demanding that U.S. Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner sign an executive order requiring the lifts. They
said they also want the administration to implement a 1986 law
requiring better disabled access at airports.
   The protesters say they wont't move until Skinner, who visited
Atlanta on Monday for the American Public Transportation
Association's convention, signs the order.
   Cason said no decision had been made as to whether the
protesters would be removed today.
   ``We'll play it as we go,'' he said.
   The demonstrators' blockade near the main entrances to the
building Monday forced employees and others to leave use an exit on
the lower level.
   ADAPT has also been trying to force the installation of lifts on
all new buses through the courts. In Philadelphia, a federal
appeals panel backed their lawsuit, saying federal law requires
lifts on new buses.
   But in July, the full 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned that ruling, saying government officials did not have to
put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving
the handicapped would be better.
   Michael Churchill, an attorney for ADAPT, said the group was
waiting to see what Congress did on the bus issue before deciding
whether to appeal.

   With growing international prestige,
President Hosni Mubarak goes to the United States this week seeking
American help with an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and dialogue
he has proposed.
   Mubarak will urge President Bush's administration to take
concrete action instead of just expressing cautious approval, as it
has done so far, Egyptian officials said.
   Egypt wants Washington to nudge Israel's Likud Party, led by
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, into accepting the dialogue and a
10-point guideline plan, according to Egyptian officials speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Mubarak arrives in New York on Thursday and will meet Bush in
Washington on Monday. Egyptian officials call the Washington talks
crucial.
   ``It's crucial in the sense that it may make or break current
peace efforts involving the dialogue proposal, Israel's plan for
Palestinian elections and Mubarak's 10-point formula to spruce up
that plan,'' a senior government official said.
   Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's political adviser, told reporters that
Mubarak will talk with Bush ``to crystallize an American position
bolstering Egypt's efforts to open a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.''
   A government official, who asked that his name be withheld for
diplomatic reasons, spoke bluntly. ``We want the United States to
step in with its full clout and put pressure on Israel.''
   Israel's Labor Party, junior partner in Shamir's Cabinet
coalition, generally approves Mubarak's suggestion of an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo to discuss Palestinian
elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir has rejected Mubarak's key ideas in public remarks, but
his divided Cabinet is to take a final decision next month.
   In May, Shamir proposed elections to choose representatives to
negotiate with Israel on interim self-rule for the two territories,
where about 1.7 million Palestinians live. In July, Mubarak put 10
questions to Israel, urging affirmative answers that would make the
election proposal more palatable to the Palestinians.
   The Mubarak approach would guarantee freedom of the balloting
under international supervision and allow 140,000 Palestinian
residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem to vote. It also would
link the election to an eventual final settlement based on Israel
giving up occupied territory for peace.
   Mubarak has said Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat accepts the Egyptian blueprint. But the PLO, which wants an
official Israeli stand first, has delayed an official position
pending a meeting of its Central Council in mid-October.
   Mubarak, whose peacemaking efforts have turned Cairo into a
diplomatic beehive, has seen his stature grow considerably in the
Arab world in the past two years.
   Most Arab countries that broke with Egypt over its 1979 peace
treaty with Israel have restored diplomatic relations, and Cairo
regained its Arab League membership in May after a 10-year
suspension.
   In February, Mubarak arranged for visiting Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to meet separately in Cairo with
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   During his New York stop, Mubarak will thrash out his and
Israel's peace ideas at meetings with Shevardnadze, Arens and
Finance Minister Shimon Peres of Israel.

   The following are excerpts from Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's speech Tuesday to the
General Assembly:
   
   We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward
yesterday by President Bush.
   Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the
Soviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons.
   The Soviet Union is ready, together with the United States, to
go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of
a multilateral convention:
   _ Cease the production of chemical weapons, as we have done
already (I am referring also to binary weapons):
   _ On a bilateral basis, radically reduce or completely destroy
Soviet and U.S. chemical weapons, regarding it as a step toward the
global destruction of chemical weapons;
   _ Renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances;
   _ Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production
of chemical warfare agents.
   I think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would
be for the overall climate in the world.
   If NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear
weapons, the USSR will respond by further unilateral cuts in its
tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for
multilateral discussions. ...
   No one in the world can as yet bid a farewell to arms. But we
can abandon, once and for all _ and do it now, the practice of
unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers.
   The U.S.S.R. is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear
explosions any day and hour, if the United states reciprocates.
   Secondly, it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at
the Conference on Disarmament and start concrete discussions there
on the problem of a complete test ban.
   Thirdly, as one possible way toward such a ban, we are now
considering the possibility of extending the 1963 Treaty to cover
underground nuclear explosions. ...
   In addition, the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear
powers, above all the United States, should begin preparing to
conclude an agreement on the cessation and prohibition, of the
production of such material.

   Vandals sliced a cable inside a manhole,
cutting service to 12,000 telephone lines in what New York
Telephone Co. said today was the worst case of sabotage since a
strike against its parent began Aug. 5.
   ``Because of the way it was done, it could take several days to
restore service to everyone,'' said spokesman Tony Pappas.
   About 4,000 suburban New York City telephone customers plus
8,000 customers with data lines, such as computer services and
burglar alarm companies, lost service, he said.
   Nassau County police Officer John Lambert said the cable was cut
Monday night. Pappas said most of the lines cut were copper, and
crews will have to go through neighboring manholes and break
through walls to run new cable.
   ``You have to have a special tool to lift the manhole cover, and
then have cable cutters,'' he said. ``It was a professional job.''
   New York Telephone says it has sustained 325 acts of vandalism
statewide affecting about 75,000 customers since the Communications
Workers went on strike against NYNEX.
   A union spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone call.

<HEAD>`Mad Dads' Group Leads Community Response to Gangs, Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles gangs have found a new market for
their drugs in the Midwest, and the resulting violence has stirred
a group of fathers calling themselves ``Mad Dads'' to fight back.
   The Mad Dads, armed only with radios, patrol gang-infested areas
of north Omaha to break up drug deals and reclaim neighborhoods
marked as gang turf.
   Earlier this month, they announced plans to use a helicopter,
but a spokesman said Monday the group was grounding that idea
because it caused too much controversy.
   Formed by fathers angry about gangs known as the Bloods and
Crips dealing drugs in their neighborhood, Mad Dads has expanded
its reach throughout the city.
   ``We felt we had to get out on the streets and start offering to
our community some semblance of security,'' Eddie Staton, an
organizer, said last week.
   ``If Mad Dads have done anything citywide, it's created an
atmosphere that there are some folks fighting back who have been
perceived as part of the problem,'' Staton said.
   Police estimate there are about 50 hard-core Crips in Omaha and
an equal number of rival Bloods. Each gang also has about 200
associates and ``wannabe'' members in the city, police said.
   The Los Angeles-based gangs have established a drug trade laced
with a kind of violence new to this largely middle-class city of
350,000.
   Drive-by shootings are becoming commonplace, and one public
housing project is so racked by drugs and violence that residents
have nicknamed it ``Vietnam.''
   After gang members beat John Foster's son, Foster, Staton and
four other men formed a committee that in May became Mad Dads _ Men
Against Destruction Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder.
The group has grown from to more than 200, 85 percent of whom are
black, Staton said.
   ``We had to figure a way of ... giving the good men in our
community who are not involved in pimping, in drugs, in drug sales
and violence an opportunity to band together and really be heard,''
he said.
   Besides running neighborhood foot patrols, Mad Dads paint over
gang graffiti and organize drug- and alcohol-free parties for
youths.
   Other groups as well as police and prosecutors also are fighting
drugs in Omaha, and businesses raised $700,000 this summer for a
program to provide needy youngsters jobs, job training and
educational and recreational programs.
   Staton said the drug and gang problem is rooted in the economic
conditions of North Omaha, which he said include 30 percent
unemployment, poor housing, inadequate educational opportunities
and institutional racism.
   ``Here comes somebody saying ... `You can take this dope and
sell it and here's how you can make money, a lot of money. And you
can sleep all day and be out having a good time all night.' That's
tempting for adults, let alone young people,'' Staton said.
   Mad Dads believe their strategy of offering positive male role
models, alternatives to gang activity and making drug dealers
uncomfortable will help crush the gangs.
   But the group is gearing up for a long fight.
   ``This is not a battle that just starts today and is going to
end next week,'' Staton said. ``This is a program that's got to be
put in place now for the next 10 to 20 years of community
involvement, of men being involved in their community in a positive
way.''

<HEAD>Orders Post Biggest Gain Since December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods accelerated 3.8 percent last month, riding brisk
automobile sales to the biggest gain since December, the government
said Tuesday.
   But some economists questioned whether that volatile
manufacturing sector could keep up the pace in the face of a
slowing economy and said the first decline in unfilled orders since
February 1987 was a sign of weakness.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally
adjusted $126.7 billion after declining 2.5 percent in July. The
July figure was revised from a 1.9 percent drop reported earlier.
   After rising 7.4 percent in December, durable goods orders have
see-sawed this year, rising in March, April, June and August and
falling in January, February, May and July.
   Orders in the transportation sector last month rose 6.3 percent
to $36.3 billion as a big increase for motor vehicles offset a
decline in aircraft. Transportation orders had risen 1.8 percent in
July.
   Even without the transporation sector, durable goods orders were
up 2.7 percent after falling 4 percent the previous month.
   ``I doubt that the automobile pace will continue,'' said Cynthia
Latta, an economist with DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass.,
business forecasting organization.
   She noted that some automakers are reducing their production
schedules and offering rebates and subsidized financing to spur
sales of 1990 models even before they get to the showroom.
   Both Ms. Latta and Robert Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New York, pointed to the
0.3 percent decline in unfilled orders as evidence of weakness.
   ``The backlog of orders declined everywhere except
transportation and that's only because of autos,'' Brusca said.
``That decline says demand is slackening.''
   The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for 14 months
to slow the economy and control inflation, began in June to nudge
rates down. Durable goods orders are particularly sensitive to
interest rates because consumers and businesses often have to
borrow to finance such purchases.
   Nevertheless, analysts said Tuesday's report would not spur the
Fed to further action.
   ``For now, it probably tends to keep the Fed on hold,'' Brusca
said.
   Ms. Latta agreed, saying, ``It can't tune policy to bail out the
durable goods manufacturers; it has to look at the whole economy.''
   Orders for non-electrical machinery, which includes computers
and a wide variety of industrial equipment, increased 9.2 percent
to $22.8 billion, but that was a rebound from a 10.4 percent
decline in July.
   Other sectors were down, including the closely watched
non-defense capital goods sector, which fell 9.8 percent to $37.4
billion. Economists watch this category as a barometer of business
investment plans.
   Electrical machinery orders declined 0.9 percent to $19.6
billion, with communications equipment showing the largest
decrease. Primary metals, including steel, were off 1.9 percent to
$11.3 billion.
   Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month
to month, orders gained 3.9 percent after falling 1.5 percent in
July. Military orders increased 1.9 percent to $7.8 billion after
plunging 14.7 percent in July.
   Shipments of durable goods in August rose 9.5 percent, the
biggest increase since a 4.5 percent advance in January 1983. But
automobiles again accounted for this gain since the Commerce
Department considers auto orders and shipments to be the same.

   The State Department today condemned the
murder of two American civilians in the Philippines, calling it a
``cowardly act of terrorism.''
   The civilians, whose names have been withheld pending
notification of their relatives, were killed in an ambush on a road
about 50 miles north of Manila shortly before Vice President Dan
Quayle arrived in the country to talk about the future of U.S.
bases there.
   The Americans worked for Ford Aerospace Corp., a contractor at
Camp O'Donnell, a U.S.-run communications facility. The road on
which the Americans were attacked runs between the camp and the
U.S. Clark Air Base.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said in a
statement that the civilian contractors of the Air Force ``were
murdered in a carefully planned ambush while driving in Tarlac
province.'' The ambush ``evidently required a certain amount of
preparation,'' he said.
   ``We deplore this senseless and cowardly act of terrorism,'' he
said. ``Acts like this will not deter us in our resolve to support
the democratic government in the Philippines.''
   In the Philippines, local authorities said the Americans' car
had been blocked by a dump truck and the jeep. Gunmen jumped out of
the jeep, sprayed their car with semi-automatic weapons fire and
then opened the car door and fired into the victims' bodies.
   The military believes the assailants were Communist rebels, who
operate in the Clark area, the officials said. Boucher said U.S.
authorities have joined local officials in the investigation.

<TEXT>
   The White House today welcomed as a ``very
constructive response'' the Soviet Union's acceptance of President
Bush's offer to reduce chemical weapons jointly and go beyond that
to ban the devices under a global agreement.
   House Speaker Thomas P. Foley called Bush's plan for U.S.-Soviet
reductions ``a good first step'' but said it does not answer the
question of how to control chemical weapons production by other
countries.
   Shevardnadze, in a United Nations speech today, said Moscow will
join the United States and ``radically reduce or completely
destroy'' all its chemical weapons stockpiles.
   He also challenged Bush to join the Soviet Union in stopping
production of all chemical weapons, halting nuclear tests and
stopping the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Shevardnadze's response ``shows that we are on the same wavelength.
It was a very constructive response. Our ultimate objective is
total elimination of chemical weapons. And it appears that both
nations are now ready to act.''
   Foley said after a meeting of congressional leaders with Bush,
``something we're concerned about trying to bring about is
participation of third countries and countries that have a
potential but not yet a significant production.''
   Administration officials contend agreement on chemical weapons
reduction by the United States and Soviet Union could also spur the
smaller countries to sign a ban.
   ``These are steps in the right direction,'' Foley said of Bush's
plan. ``I don't think many of us feel that all the potential has
been explored yet and we'd like to urge the president forward, but
certainly these are positive steps.''
   He said Shevardnadze's proposal for a complete abolition of
chemical weapons by the two superpowers, apparently regardless of
when or whether the smaller countries sign on to a treaty, ``seems
like an issue worth discussion.''
   ``We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put
forward yesterday by President Bush,'' Shevardnadze said.
``Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the
Soviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons.''
   Bush returned Monday night from New York after outlining before
the United Nations his offer of an 80 percent cut in U.S. chemical
weapons stockpiles.
   The proposal, designed to spur a 40-nation conference in Geneva
to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years, would have the two
superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20
percent of the current U.S. level. That would mean deeper cuts for
the Soviets, because U.S. officials contend Moscow has far greater
stockpiles than the United States _ an acknowledged 50,000 tons
compared to an estimated 30,000 tons for the United States.
   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts at
once, while a 40-nation treaty is being worked out in which the
United States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over
eight years if the Soviets joined the ban.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   While only the United States and Soviet Union acknowledge having
chemical weaponry, Bush said more than 20 nations have such weapons
or the capability to produce them.
   Baker told reporters the smaller countries would be persuaded to
join the ban because: ``I think you bring the force of public
opinion to bear worldwide on any country that says that they're
going to keep them and they're going to use them.''
   Baker and Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said the United States would consider imposing economic sanctions
against nations that refused to sign on to a treaty ban.
   The United States has condemned Iran and Iraq for using such
weapons and said Libya was on the verge of production. Some
officials suspect Syria has a chemical weapons program.
   ``These horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional
conflicts,'' Bush said in his speech. ``This is unacceptable.''
   Bush's proposal came after two days of talks between
Shevardnadze and Baker that produced agreement to hold a superpower
summit next spring or summer. The two sides also agreed to exchange
information about U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons and conduct
cross-inspections of arsenals.
   Bush in his speech heralded ``signs of a new attitude that
prevails between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.''
   ``Serious differences remain but the willingness to deal
constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we
and indeed the world must welcome,'' he said.
   The president said ``a new world of freedom'' is emerging around
the globe.
   ``Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of
the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' he
said.
   Twice, as vice president, Bush blocked legislation to destroy
U.S. chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in Congress. But those
would have been unilateral reductions, not tied to Soviet
compliance.
   During his first trip to the United Nations as president, Bush
also met separately Monday with the presidents of Brazil,
Guatemala, Bolivia and Venezuela and Israeli Deputy Prime Minister
Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Ahrens, then hosted a
reception and dinner for diplomats and heads of state.

devices completely plus halt nuclear testing.
   Shevardnadze, in a speech to the General Assembly, said Moscow
will join the United States and ``radically reduce or completely
destroy'' all the chemical weapons it has stockpiled.
   But he also issued a new set of challenges. He said the Soviet
Union will stop production of chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests
and stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium _ all if
Washington reciprocates.
   The speech was a prompt reply from Moscow to President Bush's
proposal Monday to drastically reduce chemical weapons stockpiles.
The proposal was given to the Soviets during the weekend and
announced by Bush in his U.N. address.
   Bush offered an 80 percent cut in U.S. chemical weapons
stockpiles if the Soviets reciprocate.
   The delegates in the hall, including Secretary of State James
Baker and U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, gave Shevardnadze a
warm round of applause after his speech.
   Baker met with the Soviet foreign minister for about seven
minutes after the speech, but declined to say what they talked
about.
   He said Shevardnadze's speech was ``very responsive to the
president's statement.'' He said he had to study it more closely
but did not think the proposals went beyond those of President Bush.
   Speaking to delegates of 159 nations, Shevardnadze said Moscow
``is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions
any day and hour, if the United States reciprocates.''
   Moscow has declared several such moratoriums, which the United
States has declined to join. U.S. officials said the Soviets
initiated such moratoriums after completing a series of tests.
   The Soviet foreign minister once again stressed disarmament,
saying that ``if NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical
nuclear weapons, the USSR will respond by further unilateral cuts
in its tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.''
   He also proposed that the production of nuclear fissionable
material for weapons be halted and that the ban be verified.
   The Soviet Union has announced that is halting the production of
enriched uranium.
   In 1987 it closed one reactor producing weapons-grade plutonium,
and Shevardnadze said ``we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a
few more such reactors. By the year 2000 all the remaining reactors
will have been shut down.''
   He proposed that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards
be used for verification, and unilaterally offered to put one
Soviet reactor under IAEA control ``to study the feasibility of
full-scale verification.''
   On chemical weapons, Shevardnadze said ``We welcome the proposal
concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President Bush.
   ``Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the
Soviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons.''
   He said ``The Soviet Union is ready, together with the United
States, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the
conclusion of a multilateral convention'' currently being discussed
by 40 nations meeting in Geneva.
   The Soviet foreign minister said his nation would join
Washington in:
   _Stopping the production of chemical weapons, including binary
weapons, which the United States still manufactures.
   _Agreeing to ``radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and
U.S. chemical weapons, regarding it as a step toward the global
destruction of chemical weapons.''
   _``Renounce the use of chemical weapons under any
circumstances.''
   _ ``Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of
production of chemical warfare agents.''
   ``I think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would
be for the overall climate in the world,'' said Shevardnadze.
   Bush's proposal, designed to spur a 40-nation conference in
Geneva to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years, would have the
two superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20
percent of the current U.S. level.
   That would mean deeper cuts for the Soviets, because U.S.
officials contend Moscow has far greater stockpiles than the United
States _ an acknowledged 50,000 tons compared to an estimated
30,000 tons for the United States.
   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts at
once, while a 40-nation treaty is being worked out in which the
United States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over
eight years if the Soviets joined the ban.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   Only the United States, the Soviet Union and Iraq acknowledge
having chemical weapons, but more than 20 nations are believed to
have them or have the capability to produce them.
   The United States has condemned Iran and Iraq for using chemical
weapons and has said Libya is on the verge of production. Some
officials suspect Syria has a chemical weapons program.
   Bush's proposal came after two days of talks between
Shevardnadze and Baker that produced agreement to hold a superpower
summit next spring or summer. The two sides also agreed to exchange
information about U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons and conduct
cross-inspections of arsenals.
   Twice, as vice president, Bush blocked legislation to destroy
U.S. chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in Congress. But those
would have been unilateral reductions, not tied to Soviet
compliance.

<HEAD>Eds: Top five grafs new to include White House endorsement; picks
up 3rd graf pvs, The agreement.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House gave its endorsement today to
a Senate compromise for funding the war on drugs that would boost
the president's plan by $900 million.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that, while
some details of the bipartisan agreement still need to be worked
out, the plan ``does appear consistent with our objectives.''
   ``We do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can
get on with implementing the drug plan,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, earlier said the agreement is ``not a
final solution, but it is a good first step toward fighting the war
on drugs.''
   ``The American people wanted more than the president requested,
and this gets more,'' Byrd told reporters in outlining the plan
Monday night.
   The agreement, subject to final approval by a handful of key
senators who were returning to Washington today, would raise to
$8.8 billion the anti-drug funds for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1. It includes an across-the-board cut of about 0.43 percent
in other federal programs to pay for the stepped-up drug war.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., called the agreement on
financing the plan ``fairly final.'' But he noted disagreements
remained on when to take up separate legislation enacting parts of
Bush's anti-crime package, including capital punishment and drug
testing for those arrested on drug charges.
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., the chief negotiator for Senate
Republicans, said the White House had agreed to the plan in general
terms.
   Bush was traveling Monday and had not analyzed the details of
the proposed agreement, said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
But if it proves consistent with news reports, ``then it may form a
basis on which we may proceed,'' Popadiuk said.
   The accord was expected to break a two-week logjam keeping four
major spending bills from final Senate passage: transportation;
foreign aid; veterans, housing and space; and labor, health and
education.
   But it appeared impossible for Congress to pass in time all of
the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running after
Sept. 30, and the House was expected today to approve a 25-day
stopgap spending measure. The bill would continue the flow of cash
to federal programs at current levels.
   The compromise anti-drug figure would be $900 million more than
Bush sought in his Sept. 5 speech to the nation, and $3.1 billion
more than is being spent on anti-drug programs in the current
fiscal year. Congressional Democrats had criticized Bush's request
as too little to make headway against the drug scourge.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the
agreement would ``substantially improve the president's drug
package'' and added he was ``gratified that the administration has
agreed to support necessary funding for the drug program.''
   While the compromise figure went a little less than halfway
toward the $2.2 billion increase Byrd originally proposed, nearly
all of the increase _ $800 million _ would be devoted to drug
treatment, education and prevention programs that Democrats said
were most seriously underfunded in Bush's outline.
   Hatfield sought to minimize any Democratic advantage from the
accord by pointing to Bush's leadership in proposing the anti-drug
package in the first place.
   ``This is a bipartisan war,'' Hatfield said, adding that he
expected many Senate Republicans to support the compromise package.
``The Democrats don't have any greater degree of support for the
drug war than the Republicans.''
   Left unresolved were several legislative initiatives Bush had
proposed on habeas corpus and the death penalty to strengthen the
prosecution of drug dealers. Those awaited talks with Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., who was out of
town on Monday.
   Discussions aimed at finding a compromise broke off on Friday
after an apparent stalemate was reached. Byrd, the chief Democratic
negotiator, complained that the White House had been ``a shadow
participant'' in the negotiations and was causing the breakdown.
   But Hatfield said Byrd telephoned him Friday night and the two
met on Saturday to begin putting the talks back on track.
   A substantial part of the compromise involved the mechanism to
pay for the increased anti-drug programs. The across-the-board cut
would hit most government programs equally, excluding Social
Security and other federal benefits.
   That would mean a dent of about $1.3 billion in next year's
$288.2 billion Pentagon budget. But in the case of defense
spending, the agreement allows the flexibility the administration
had sought to allocate the cuts to areas where the pinch can be
minimized.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the senior GOP member of the defense
Appropriations subcommittee, said the cuts probably would be aimed
at plans for new weapons procurement in order to protect crucial
areas like personnel and military readiness, and weapons
productions lines already in operation.

<TEXT>
   An East German emissary today told
East Germans holed up in the West German Embassy that they can
legally emigrate to the West but first must return home, a
spokesmen for the refugees said.
   Wolfgang Vogel arrived today to speak to representatives of
about 1,200 East Germans who have crowded the garden of the West
German Embassy in hopes of obtaining safe passage to the West.
   After meeting with Vogel, between 50 and 60 East Germans boarded
a bus that reportedly took them to a Prague railroad station for
their journey back to East Germany. The others, however, remained
in the embassy quarters and it was unclear if they refused the East
German offer.
   Vogel is an East Berlin lawyer who has close contacts with the
East German leadership.
   Refugees who took part in the negotiations told reporters
waiting outside the embassy that Vogel gave them a personal
guarantee they could emigrate once they returned home.
   Already, more than 20,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany
via Hungary, which incensed East Germany's Communist leaders when
it opened its border to the West on Sept. 11.
   In Warsaw, Poland, dozens of other East Germans arrived Monday
outside the closed West German Embassy to seek passage to the West.
Some said they swam rivers by night or walked through forests on
the Polish-East German border.
   In Prague, a Western reporter on Monday afternoon witnessed some
40 new arrivals scale the 7-foot fence of the West Germany Embassy
in the conspicuous absence of Czechoslovak police who had earlier
patrolled the street outside, urging reporters to leave.
   By nightfall, the number of East Germans holed up inside the
compound had reached around 980, refugees reported.
   Some said they'd had to spend Sunday night in the open air for
lack of Red Cross tents, but new tents arrived during the day.
   In the area near the embassy, police have towed away all East
German cars.
   ``The situation is getting ever more difficult,'' said a
40-year-old East German, who, like all the others, asked for
anonymity.
   He said that his wife and children had successfully made it to
the West via Hungary, but he himself was intercepted by
Czechoslovak border guards as he drove in his car toward the
Czechoslovak-Hungarian frontier.
   Other would-be refugees were also caught.
   Fearing imprisonment at home, he told a reporter, ``Where else
should I have gone? The Bonn Embassy was the last way out.''
   Those camping in the embassy garden are mostly people aged
30-40, but there are also 200 children including several infants.
There was hardly any space left to put up new tents.
   In Warsaw, at least 300 East Germans are being accommodated,
either in a group of West German Embassy houses in the villa
district of Saska Kepa or in a park-surrounded former seminary in
Tarchomin, just outside Warsaw.
   The embassy was closed to the public last week to prevent more
refugees from entering.
   The East Germans were anxious to be allowed onto embassy grounds
on Monday, but guards stood inside the locked gates. However,
embassy officers after making an announcement in the afternoon
could be seen escorting small groups away from the embassy,
presumably to a shelter for the night.
   A tall young East German who identified himself as Paul, 23,
described his escape from his homeland.
   He said he blew up an air mattress, placed his belongings on it
and then swam with the mattress across the Neisse River that forms
the Polish-East German border in southwest Poland.

<HEAD>Water Damage Expected to Have Little Impact on Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water damage to Columbia is less
than originally thought, and the shuttle has a good chance to meet
its December launch target, the director of the Kennedy Space
Center said Tuesday.
   ``It certainly does not have the dimensions of doom we were
concerned about'' after fire protection water drenched Columbia on
Sunday, Forrest McCartney said in an interview.
   ``We've not really assessed what the impact will be on the
launch date, but my personal assessment on it right now is that it
will be minimal, if any,'' he said.
   ``Sunday we had a very bad day, and we had a very gloomy
outlook, but it's Tuesday morning, and, while we see some
additional work to be done, we feel that work can be
accomplished,'' he said.
   The accident occurred as three workers were performing routine
maintenance on the fire sprinkler system in the hangar where
Columbia is being readied for a Dec. 18 launch. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration reported a valve in one
sprinkler head failed, causing a leakage of water.
   Two other workers, in their haste to stop the flow,
inadvertantly turned on other sprinklers, and several thousand
gallons of water poured onto work platforms and the shuttle. Other
workers were able to shut off the water after several minutes.
   ``I'm chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and
human error,'' said Thomas Utsman, deputy director of the space
center and head of a team investigating the incident.
   Utsman said Monday that as many as 200 of the shuttle's 500
woven fiberglass heat shields might have been damaged by the
soaking and might have to be replaced.
   But McCartney said Tuesday the number was closer to 70 or 80 and
that most of them were off the shuttle, sitting to the side on
racks. They had been removed to give technicians access to a series
of steering jets in the spaceship's nose.
   McCartney said there had been some concern that damage might
have occurred to Columbia's electrical system, but when power was
turned on Tuesday morning, there were no problems detected.
   ``The system has to be flexible enough to accept these
disruptions,'' McCartney said. ``I don't want to downplay the
problem, but I think we are professional enough and flexible enough
to cope with this one.''
   Columbia's crew of five is to deploy a communications satellite
and retrieve for return to Earth a scientific payload that has been
orbiting for more than five years.
   Two prior shuttle missions are scheduled. Atlantis is to carry
the Galileo-Jupiter probe into space on Oct. 12 and Discovery is
being groomed for a Nov. 19 liftoff with a Defense Department
payload.

<HEAD>Perpich Asks Supreme Court To Review National Guard Lawsuit Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich said Tuesday he is
asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appellate decision
upholding a law that stripped governors of their veto power over
National Guard training missions.
   Congress enacted the law, known as the Montgomery Amendment,
after several governors in 1985 and 1986 objected to deployment of
National Guard personnel on maneuvers in Central America, where the
governors felt there was a danger of involvement in wars.
   The law ``presents a states' rights issue of historical
importance,'' Perpich said at a news conference. ``Because of
conflicting decisions in the lower courts, this issue warrants a
final resolution by the Supreme Court.''
   Perpich said he has never disapproved of any federal training
deployment of the Minnesota National Guard, but is challenging the
law's constitutionality because it invades on a governor's
authority.
   Perpich initially challenged the Montgomery Amendment on Jan.
28, 1987. The amendment to a 1986 defense bill says governors may
not withhold their consent to National Guard missions ``because of
any objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such
active duty.''
   The amendment was upheld in U.S. District Court, but a
three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it
was unconstitutional. At the request of the U.S. Department of
Justice, the full 8th Circuit considered the matter and, on June
28, it held 7-2 that the law is constitutional.
   Minnesota's lawsuit contends the law violates the Militia Clause
of the Constitution, which reserves to states authority to direct
or consent to peacetime training of the National Guard.
   A statement issued Tuesday by the office of the amendment's
author, Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., said the case already has
been argued ``exhaustively.''
   ``The courts have ruled the amendment to be constitutional,''
Montgomery said. ``It's time now to let the National Guard get back
to the business of training and away from the courtroom. It would
be a terrible mistake to deny our Guard personnel the chance to
train in real world conditions that can't be duplicated at bases in
the United States.''
   Jack Tunheim, Minnesota's chief deputy attorney general, said a
decision from the Supreme Court on whether it will hear the case is
expected in two to three months.
   The Supreme Court's refusal to hear a similar challenge to the
law, filed by Massachusetts and rejected by the 1st U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, should have no bearing on whether the high court
considers Minnesota's challenge, Tunheim said.
   ``That case was not nearly as well-developed as the Minnesota
case,'' Tunheim said. The 1st Circuit issued a one-sentence order
affirming the law, while the decisions in the Minnesota case have
prompted lengthy dissents, Tunheim said.

   Black parents agreed to send their
children to class today for the first time in two weeks after
reaching a compromise over the school board's renaming of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary.
   Under the agreement, the school will be known officially as West
Lowndes Elementary, but the building itself will be named for the
slain civil rights leader.
   The compromise was approved Monday by the Lowndes County School
Board, the parents association and the county's NAACP.
   Officials said today that 350 students showed up out of an
enrollment of 425. Only 32 attended on Sept. 12, the first day of
the boycott.
   Last spring, the old school board, composed of three whites and
two blacks, voted to name the new school for King. But a newly
elected board with only one black member designated it Motley
Elementary, for the land's former owner, saying it wanted a name
that was not racially identifiable.
   The school is more than 95 percent black.

<HEAD>Game and Fish Officials Open Hearings on Returning Ferrets to the
Wild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEETEETSE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The populaton of black-footed ferrets,
once believed extinct is growing in captive breeding and eventually
the animals will be set free in Wyoming's high plains.
   This week the state Game and Fish Department is holding hearings
in Meeteetse, Cody and Casper to discuss a reintroduction plan that
could see the first of the small, masked mammals released into the
wild by 1991.
   Four years ago, an epidemic of canine distemper nearly wiped out
the only known colony of the nocturnal, weasel-like creatures, and
wildlife biologists trapped the last 18 for a captive breeding
program.
   The program centered at the department's Sybille Canyon facility
has boosted the known population of ferrets to some 120.
   This week's hearings will draw public comment on plans to return
some of the ferrets to the plains surrounding Meeteetse, where they
were found in 1981 after being considered extinct.
   ``It's only right,'' said town recreation director Jim Sessions,
who keeps in his office Meeteetse's only remaining black-footed
ferret _ stuffed.
   But some objectives must be met before reintroduction.
   Scientists are working on a vaccine to immunize the animals
against distemper, said Tom Thorne, a state veterinarian who
directed the breeding project.
   And the ferrets must be taught how to kill prairie dogs, their
natural prey. To help the animals learn, Game and Fish has built
caged, outdoor prairie dog colonies.
   But there's no fear that captive-bred ferrets won't recognize
predators that can kill them, said Thorne.
   ``If anything, they are wilder and more afraid of us than the
wild-caught ferrets,'' he said. ``My hope is that they're going to
regard everything except prairie dogs as a predator.''
   Critics worry that human activity _ particularly the area's
ranching and oil industries _ will be a bigger problem.
   Exxon has proposed drilling a well a few miles from prime ferret
habitat, and a public hearing on that proposal is scheduled
Thursday in Meeteetse.
   But Pitchfork Ranch manager Jack Turnell, 43, a member of an
advisory board on the ferret program, said he has ``zero concern''
about drilling.
   ``The ferret doesn't give a damn about people or machinery or
cattle or anything else,'' said Turnell. ``There's only one thing
they care about _ that's a food source.''
   Turnell said scientists want him to persuade other ranchers to
let ferrets be introduced into prairie dog towns on their ranches.
   But the ranchers are afraid, ``not of ferrets, but of
bureaucrats and environmentalists because they go overboard with
their rules and regulations,'' he said.
   Wildlife officials hope to ease that fear by having the
reintroduced ferrets declared a ``non-essential experimental
population'' under the Endangered Species Act. That would lift
restrictions that protect every individual of a threatened species
and reduce bureaucratic reaction to ferret deaths.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor arrived for Day 12 of
her cop-slapping trial complaining she was late because the
``gorgeous'' policeman who arrested her in June was working a speed
trap on Sunset Boulevard.
   ``Officer (Paul) Kramer made me late. He stopped the traffic
with a radar gun. There he was, looking his gorgeous self, with
radar,'' Miss Gabor told reporters when she reached the courthouse
at 9 a.m.
   Municipal Judge Charles Rubin on Monday had declared the trial
was taking too long and ordered that sessions start an hour early,
at 8:45 a.m.
   The former Hungarian beauty queen is on trial on misdemeanor
charges stemming from her June 14 arrest by Kramer, who stopped her
Rolls-Royce for having an expired registration.
   Miss Gabor said her mother, Jolie, and older sister Magda would
be in courtroom for the afternoon session. She said she spent extra
time picking an outfit to please her.
   ``Mother's very critical,'' Miss Gabor said. ``They're going to
sit here for support.''
   The trial, now in its third week, has cost taxpayers an
estimated $22,000 and provided fodder for journalists around the
world. They have dutifully reported Miss Gabor's sometimes
outrageous statements, which at one point drew a reprimand from the
judge for failing to heed his gag order.
   On Monday, Miss Gabor retracted an out-of-court remark that she
was afraid to go to jail because lesbians were there.
   ``I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay
boys working for me,'' the actress told reporters. ``I got letter
from the lesbians and gay association. They are going to boycott me
because I said there are lesbians in jail.''
   The trial originally was expected to last a week. Defense
attorney William Graysen said new witnesses located over the
weekend could extend it until Friday.
   In court, a defense witness Monday supported Miss Gabor's
account that she slapped Kramer in self-defense.
   ``That man was after blood I think,'' said David Katzman, a
free-lance screenwriter who has written for ``Knots Landing'' and
``Dallas.''
   Katzman said he stopped his car when he noticed the unusual
sight of a policeman pulling over a white Rolls-Royce Corniche, and
became concerned as he watched.
   ``The lady looked as if she was going to be threatened and as
though she would be hurt,'' he testified.
   Miss Gabor could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of
misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open
container of alcohol in her car.

<TEXT>
   A survey of almost 400,000 junior high and
high school students nationwide found that the percentage using
drugs has dropped in the past two years, but those who use cocaine
are getting higher.
   ``I'm discouraged that the levels of intoxication are
increasing,'' Thomas J. Gleaton, Jr., president of National
Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, said Tuesday in
announcing the survey results.
   The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who said they use
cocaine dropped from 6.4 percent in 1986-87 to 4.6 percent in the
1988-89 school year. However, those users who reported getting
``very high '' or ``bombed@stoned'' from the drug rose from 71.4
percent to 74.5 percent over the two-year period, according to the
PRIDE survey.
   In the junior high grades of 6-8, 1.7 percent of the students
said they had used cocaine in the past year, a drop from 2.3
percent in 1986-87. But 68.2 percent of those users said they got
``very high'' or ``bombed@stoned,'' compared with 65.2 percent in
the earlier survey.
   The drop in the percentage of students who said they used
cocaine ``means the casual user is more careful, more frightened of
the drug,'' Gleaton said.
   Outlining a profile of the student cocaine user, Gleaton
described a ``venturesome'' and ``sociable'' youth who ``wants to
be first. ... He's got a wonderful little ego.''
   Although the use of beer, liquor, marijuana and cocaine showed
declines from the 1986-87 survey for students in grades 6-12,
levels of junior high students' use of liquor and cocaine remained
higher than they were in the 1984-85 survey.
   The percentage of students in grades 6-8 who said they used
liquor was 21.2 percent in 1984-85, peaked at 26.3 percent two
years ago and dropped to 24.9 percent in the latest survey. The
percentage who said they used cocaine was 1.3 percent four years
ago, peaked at 2.3 percent two years ago and dropped to 1.7 percent
in the new study.
   In addition, the latest survey detected weekly cocaine use in
the sixth grade.
   Of the 29,116 sixth graders who responded to a question about
cocaine use, 0.8 percent, or about 233, said they used cocaine
weekly or daily. About 58 sixth graders said they used cocaine once
or twice a month, and another 87 said they used cocaine one to six
times a year.
   For junior high students, of the 161,907 who answered the
cocaine question, 0.7 percent or 1,133 said they used it weekly or
daily; an equal number used it infrequently and 648 said they used
it once or twice a month.
   ``Whereas we have seen some drops (in drug use) at the upper
grades, at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more
use,'' compared with four years earlier, said Doug Hall, vice
president of PRIDE.
   Gleaton said the reduced levels among high schoolers may reflect
that those who start using drugs early drop out of school and
therefore were not surveyed.
   The survey covered 392,003 students in grades 6 to 12 who
answered an anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38
states.
   Hall said the survey represented a cross-section of the United
States, from inner cities to rural areas, but it was not a
scientific, random selection of students.
   Cigarette smoking gained popularity among all levels of students
surveyed, with 38.7 percent of high school students and 28.1
percent of junior high students saying they had smoked a cigarette,
increases over both two and four years ago.
   Gleaton said that might be because the public is ``focusing so
much now on crack, on cocaine ... on drugs,'' that less attention
is paid to cigarettes.
   The educational level and employment status of parents did not
differ widely between cocaine-using high school seniors and those
who abstain, the survey found.
   ``In fact, the parents of cocaine-using students were slightly
better-educated,'' the study said.

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce today
refused to answer questions from a House subcommittee investigating
scandals at the agency during his eight-year tenure, citing his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Pierce, appearing before the subcommittee under a subpoena, said
criticism of him by members of the panel ``leads me to the painful
conclusion that I have been prejudged by this body.''
   Pierce made the dramatic announcement in a brief opening
statement to the subcommittee. At his insistence, television
cameras and photography equipment were barred during Pierce's
appearance.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Thomas Lantos, then posed a
series of eight questions to Pierce regarding his tenure at HUD,
and each time Pierce refused to answer, citing his constitutional
rights.
   Lantos said Pierce may have waived his rights not to answer by
testifying voluntarily before the same committee in May. But Lantos
said he would not rule immediately on that question as chairman and
told Pierce's lawyers to submit written arguments on the
constitutional question within a week.
   Lantos, D-Calif., also said he would again urge current HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp to cooperate with Pierce's request under the
Freedom of Information Act for HUD documents.
   Pierce refused to answer questions from reporters as he left the
hearing room.
   His attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he hoped Pierce would be
ready to testify on Oct. 27, the next time the subpoena requires
him to appear. ``This man is an innocent man,'' Perito said. ``This
man wants very much to tell his story.''
   Among the questions Lantos put to Pierce were ones about his
approval, over the objection of other HUD officials, of HUD funds
for an elderly housing project in Durham, N.C.
   Lantos also asked Pierce to explain an announcement by President
Reagan of the awarding of a HUD grant for elderly housing in Ewing,
N.J., during a campaign appearance in 1982 on behalf of the
Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Millicent Fenwick. Lantos
questioned how that announcement was consistent with Pierce's
previous contention that the housing program was not run on a
political basis.
   Lantos ended his questioning, saying, ``It is obvious the
witness ... is determined to invoke his Fifth Amendment
prerogative.''
   Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, the ranking Republican on the
panel, told Pierce, ``I am truly disappointed and frustrated'' by
his refusal to testify.
   Virtually every member of the panel said that they hoped Pierce
would agree to testify, but said even before he spoke that they
expected him to invoke his constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   Pierce was originally scheduled to testify on Sept. 15 but
refused to appear, saying he had just hired an attorney and was not
ready. The subcommittee then subpoenaed Pierce and demanded that he
appear today.
   Pierce showed up as scheduled, but after being sworn in as a
witness read a brief statement in which he said he would not answer
questions because he still had not had enough time to prepare. He
also said he had determined that the committee would not grant him
a fair hearing.
   ``Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me to assert
my constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by
refusing to answer questions,'' he said.
   Pierce's appearance came after an angry exchange between his
attorneys and Lantos. Perito had objected to having three lawmakers
who are not members of the subcommittee present at the hearing.
   When Perito asked that those three be barred from asking
questions, Lantos said that, under House rules, Pierce's attorneys
had no right to speak but only to advise Pierce.
   ``In this hearing, you are in fact a potted plant,'' Lantos told
Perito.
   That was a reference to the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings, when
Oliver North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, forcefully told a
different investigating committee, ``I am not a potted plant.''
   During a round of lengthy opening statements, lawmakers
criticized Pierce for refusing to appear voluntarily and suggested
he was reluctant to testify because he had something to hide.
   Lantos also dismissed Pierce's contention that he would not be
treated fairly.
   ``We are not engaged in a punitive mission,'' Lantos said.
   Perito told reporters later, however, that he still believed the
subcommittee had a vendetta against Pierce. ``What they want to do
is rush him to judgment. They want to try, convict and sentence
him, and we will not let that occur,'' Perito said.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that by seeking delays and
forcing the committee to subpoena him, Pierce was playing ``a game
of legal hide and seek'' to avoid testifying about problems at the
agency he headed for the eight years of the Reagan administration.
   Pierce refused to answer questions after insisting that no
television cameras, still photographers or radio reporters be
allowed to record or photograph his testimony.
   House rules allow subpoeaned witnesses to ask for such
restrictions on media coverage and Pierce refused when Lantos asked
him to reconsider the request.
   Pierce testified in May that he was not a ``hands-on'' manager,
and he also told reporters that some of his aides had apparently
betrayed him.
   Since then, however, several former deputies challenged Pierce's
account that he was not directly involved in major funding
decisions. Agency records disclosed since then also show a greater
Pierce role in major decisions than he indicated. Neither the
testimony nor the records, however, suggest any wrongdoing by
Pierce.

<DATELINE>TERRACE, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A twin-engine commuter plane
trying to land in heavy fog crashed and burned today, killing all
seven people aboard, authorities said.
   The Skylink Airlines plane en route from Vancouver went down in
the woods near the airport here with five passengers and two crew
members, authorities said.
   ``What we know at this stage is the weather conditions were very
bad and that the airport was covered with fog,'' said Christiane
Cote, a spokesman for Canada's transportation department.
``Therefore visibility was minimal.
   ``The pilot attempted to land one time and decided to abort his
attempt and was presumably on his way to try a second attempt to
land when the plane crashed.''
   Terrace is about 435 miles northwest of Vancouver. The plane
operated by the Vancouver-based airline was capable of carrying 18
passengers.
   ``We got a call from air radio requesting us to help locate the
crash scene,'' said Ian Swan, who piloted the helicopter that
pinpointed the wreck.
   ``It was patchy cloud over the area so I couldn't see much. I
saw the smoke, though. I directed the ground crews to it.''

   A highly decorated police officer who
has difficulty reading because of a learning disability has won his
battle to have someone read him the test he must pass to be
promoted to sergeant.
   Officer Curt Spanos' first request for a reader was rejected
last week. P. William Herndon, Howard County's assistant personnel
administrator, noted that Spanos had passed the written test
without a reader two years ago and would be given ample time to
complete it this time.
   But Monday, after Spanos challenged the decision with help from
an advocate for the disabled, Herndon said a reader would be made
available for the test Sunday.
   ``I feel relieved,'' Spanos said. ``I don't know why they made
me jump through the hoops. If I hadn't enlisted the help of an
advocate, I wonder where I would be.''
   He said the fact that he had passed the test without a reader
should not have been used as grounds to deny him one now.
   Spanos, 41, a 17-year police veteran and the county's most
decorated officer, has dyslexia, a disability that makes it
difficult for him to read and write some words. That did not stop
him from graduating from college.
   Because of dyslexia, he was held back a grade in school, and a
police department supervisor once sent him to class with elementary
children to improve his reading and writing, he said.
   ``I have to memorize words,'' he said. ``There are times when I
simply don't recall a word and I try to put it in context and
sometimes I get it wrong. Also, there are times I read a word and
the letters run together or when I write, I leave a letter out.''
   Four years ago, he said, he narrowly flunked the written part of
the sergeant's test, disqualifying him from the promotional list.
   Two years later, he passed the test and other requirements to be
placed on the qualifying list. But the county decided not to fill
all of the sergeant vacancies because there were no minorities on
the list. The list expires every two years.
   ``I felt disappointed, extremely frustrated and angry,'' Spanos
said. ``I think it is worth taking a chance. I am not a rookie any
more. If this comes back to haunt me, so be it. Maybe someone else
will benefit in the future.''
   Spanos enlisted the help of Robert Ardinger, an instructor of
U.S. government at Howard Community College who is a member of the
county's Commission on Disability Issues and a co-founder of the
advocacy group Disabled in Action.
   Ardinger said he was ``taken aback'' by the original denial.
``It was such a reasonable request for this kind of disability.
There is no question Officer Spanos is entitled to this
accommodation,'' he said.

   A man who disappeared for four years
after embezzling more than $1.1 million from a bank where he worked
has pleaded guilty to embezzlement, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
   Ronald E. Denslow entered the plea Monday after the government
agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than three years in
prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Janet Parker. He could have
faced up to 65 years.
   A tip from a viewer of the ``Unsolved Mysteries'' television
show led to Denslow's arrest Aug. 8 at Gardnerville, Nev., where he
was living under an assumed name. He had disappeared in November
1985.
   Denslow was accused of embezzling $100,900 from the Mount
Pleasant branch of the Bank of Alma, where he worked, as well as
depositing two $500,000 cashier's checks drawn on phony accounts he
set up at the bank.
   The bank got wise to the embezzlement and stopped Denslow from
getting his hands on most of the money, Parker said.

<TEXT>
   Country musician Russell Smith says he
organized a benefit concert to aid cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill
because he believes Exxon has reneged on its promise to restore the
area.
   Besides Smith, other performers slated to appear Wednesday at
Nashville's Center Stage include Rodney Crowell, J.C. Crowley, Guy
Clark, Vince Gill, Maura O'Connell, Jonelle Mosser, New Grass
Revival and Alaska's Hobo Jim.
   Smith, whose new album is titled ``This Little Town,'' said
Monday he was moved by the plight of the wildlife and people living
along the hundreds of miles of shoreline soiled by the spill.
Nearly 11 million gallons of oil poured into Prince William Sound
after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef on March 24.
   The bodies of more than 30,000 birds and about 1,000 animals
have been found. Biologists say those figures probably represent
only 5 percent to 10 percent of the deaths caused by the spill.
   ``When I found out about this I became concerned, more than
concerned. I became extremely angry about it,'' Smith said. ``Their
economy was shot to hell because of this. Everyone needed money so
bad. Fishermen have lost their boats because they missed the
fishing season.''
   Exxon spent at least $1.2 billion on the cleanup before stopping
its efforts earlier this month because of worsening weather and
dwindling daylight.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said the state would conduct a $21
million program ``to continue cleanup work left by Exxon.''
   Exxon has said it will re-evaluate the shorelines next spring
and decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale.
   ``One of the main things we are trying to do is keep this before
the public's attention to keep pressure on Exxon to keep their
promise and clean it up,'' Smith said.
   The concert is expected to raise $16,000 to $20,000, 95 percent
of which will go to the Prince William Sound Cleanup and
Rehabilitation Fund administered by the Alaska Conservation
Foundation. Only the cost of printing and selling the
$20-per-person tickets was not donated, Smith said.
   The money will be used to help wildlife and clean the area. The
Alaska Conservation Foundation is a 10-year-old, non-profit group
that pays for environmental education and policy studies.
   Rounding up artists for the concert wasn't difficult, Smith said.
   ``Most of the people I have asked are pretty much concerned
people, concerned about the environment, period,'' he said.

   Free speech is coming to the campus of
the University of Southern Mississippi, with the setting aside of a
``Speaker's Corner'' where anyone can voice their opinions.
   ``Before the `Speaker's Corner,' if someone stood on a corner
and began to speak, according to our rules we would have had to
stop them,'' said Joe Paul, dean of student development. ``Anyone
who wished to speak on campus had to register a time and place to
speak.
   ``With the `Speaker's Corner,' anyone can voice their opinion
without going through all of that.''
   A lectern is set up on Union Plaza at one end of the R.C. Cook
University Union. Any individual or organization may use the site
on a first-come, first-serve basis. No reservations can be made.
   ``The location gives people a place to sit and listen to the
speaker, and the speaker won't disturb any classes or anyone in the
Union,'' said Warren Dunn, administrative assistant to the student
affairs vice president.
   There are still limits: no profanity and no signs to advertise a
speech.

   The University of Maine is offering to
return to the Zuni Indians a statue that the university museum
displayed for a year before learning that the tribe considers it
offensive to display the sacred piece.
   University trustees voted Monday to authorize return of the
statue to the New Mexico tribe and officials said Tuesday the
university will contact tribal leaders to make the necessary
arrangements.
   ``It's up to the Zuni Nation to come and pick it up,'' said
university arts publicist Maria Tijan-Wieck.
   The university's Hudson Museum placed the statue in storage
about two years ago after a visitor from the Southwest told
officials about its significance. Since then, officials said they
have learned that other museums also have voluntarily returned Zuni
statues to the tribe.
   The wooden carving of a male figure is about 32 inches tall and
is believed to be less than 100 years old.

   Cesar Romero, Walter Matthau and
other celebrities marveled at director Billy Wilder's art
collection _ and at the multimillion-dollar prices the works are
expected to bring at auction.
   ``Marvelous!'' enthused actor and art connoisseur Vincent Price
on Monday. ``I just wish I could afford them.''
   The paintings, which have been hung in Wilder's Wilshire
Boulevard apartment, are to be auctioned by Christie's in New York
on Nov. 13.
   Bidders are expected to pay from $5 million to $7 million for a
work by Picasso, $1.5 million to $2 million for a Miro painting and
between $1.5 million to $2 million for a Balthus nude.
   Why sell art works he has lovingly assembled over more than half
a century?
   ``Because I can no longer add to them,'' said Wilder, 83, the
winner of six Academy Awards, whose movies include such classics as
``The Lost Weekend'' and ``The Apartment.''
   ``All of a sudden the prices of the art I like have a number of
zeros added to them,'' he said.
   ``The insurance got too high,'' added the director's wife,
Audrey. ``I don't worry about theft, but I was concerned about
fire. We lost a lot of good things in a fire in Billy's office at
Goldwyn Studios.''
   Other preview guests who checked out the 94 works on display at
the Beverly Hills Hotel included actors Louis Jourdan and Michael
York, painter David Hockney and financier Marvin Davis.

   Edie Adams, whose sultry cigar-hawking line,
``Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?'' became a
household phrase in the 1960s, is embroiled in a love-hate
relationship with a planned autobiography.
   Adams, the 60-year-old widow of pioneering TV comedian Ernie
Kovacs, says she is a millionaire thanks to royalties from her
20-year stint as the Muriel cigar model and profits from her
cosmetics line, a chain of beauty salons and a line of designer
clothing.
   She plans to share the secrets to her successes and failures,
which include a 160-acre almond orchard she bought by selling her
Beverly Hills home, in the autobiography. But first, she said, she
must master a word processor, so she can finish ``this damned ...
this wonderful book'' by her deadline next spring.
   ``That machine and I are mortal enemies,'' she said.
   Adams started in business in 1962 when her husband died in a car
crash and left $500,000 in debts.
   She also has continued to perform. This summer, she did ``The
Odd Couple'' in Montclair, N.J.
   Adams' plans include buying out Mae West's estate to revive
West's stage show ``Diamond Lil'' and repackaging Kovacs'
television shows, shot on 35mm- film, for syndication.

   Japan's Prince Aya, who left Tuesday to resume
graduate studies in zoology at Oxford University in England, will
marry his fiancee next June, the Imperial Household Agency
announced.
   The 23-year-old prince, second son of Emperor Akihito and
Empress Michiko, will wed Kiko Kawashima, also 23, in late June but
the exact date has not been set, an agency official said.
   Prince Aya is second in line to the throne after his elder
brother, Crown Prince Naruhito. He is to resume his second year of
study at Oxford's St. John's College in mid-October.
   On Sept. 12, the 10-member Imperial Household Council, led by
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, unanimously approved the engagement
of Prince Aya and Miss Kawashima, who first met four years ago on
the campus of the private Gakushuin University in Tokyo. Miss
Kawashima, the daughter of a Gakushuin professor, is in a graduate
course in psychology at the university.
   The wedding had to wait at least until after January, the end of
a one-year mourning period for Aya's grandfather, Emperor Hirohito,
who died at age 87 after a 62-year reign.
   Crown Prince Naruhito studied at Oxford's Merton College in
1983-85.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to back
a federal commission's decision to shut down 86 military bases and
scale down five more as lawmakers weighed a $228.2 billion military
spending bill.
   By a vote of 86-14, the Senate approved an amendment that
effectively kills a provision that would have withheld $300 million
to close the bases until an audit found that the savings from
shutting down the installations would exceed the cost.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that further cuts
in the defense budget by the Democratic-controlled Congress may
force him to close more bases.
   The audit would have been conducted by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``We're just asking that the comptroller general analyze.
Otherwise these bases have no appeal,'' Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, said on the Senate floor in support of the amendment.
``There is no Supreme Court. This is the Supreme Court.''
   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, argued against undermining the
commission's recommendations, which were approved by former
Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and upheld in the House.
   ``If we set a precedent now that you can re-open the package,
I'm fearful future commissions won't be as effective,'' Warner said.
   The commission, in issuing its recommendation last year,
estimated savings of $5.6 billion over 20 years.
   Since the commission's announcement last December, lawmakers
whose home-state bases would be affected complained that the panel
based its selection on inaccurate or incomplete data.
   Prior to the Senate action, Cheney met on Capitol Hill with
lawmakers from Illinois who made a last-ditch appeal to save
Chanute Air Force Base near Rantoul, Ill. The session did not
change plans to close Chanute, 120 miles south of Chicago.
   ``Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense
budget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close
additional bases,'' Cheney told reporters the day after Senate
Democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to
boost President Bush's anti-drug effort by $900 million.
   The drug plan requires a cut of about $1.3 billion in the
Pentagon budget.
   On the Senate floor, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., criticized the
recommendations made last year by the ``faceless, nameless members
of the commission.''
   ``They cooked the books,'' Dixon said, waving a copy of a
General Accounting Office report that had found problems in the
commission's report. The GAO is an investigative agency of Congress.
   Residents and businesses in several Illinois counties and cities
near Chanute pooled their money to hire an influential lobbying
firm to argue for Inouye's measure. The cost for hiring Patton,
Boggs and Blow is estimated at about $30,000.
   The Senate also was weighing legislation that cuts President
Bush's request for Star Wars and the Trident 2 missile, but leaves
other strategic programs relatively intact.
   Among the major provisions of the spending bill are:
   _A cut of about $800 million from Bush's $4.9 billion proposal
for the Strategic Defense Initiative in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and fellow
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of California plan to introduce an
amendment to raise the spending level for Star Wars.
   _Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident
2 missile and an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216
million for research and development of the submarine-launched
weapons. The Trident 2 missile suffered two successive failures in
undersea test firings one month before the committee action.
   _A requirement that $820 million of the $3.7 billion for Star
Wars be used for research on lasers and particle beams. Sen.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor of the amendment, expressed
concerns that the administration will sacrifice long-term research
on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment along the
lines of the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in the
administration.
   _Provisions similar to those in an earlier authorization bill,
with most of Bush's strategic programs left intact, including the
MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. The
spending plan also accepts the president's decision to cancel the
Navy's F-14D jet fighter.
   _Earmarking $255 million for the Marine Corps to test the V-22
Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane the administration sought to
cancel.

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
refused to answer questions Tuesday from a House panel
investigating housing scandals, citing his constitutional right
against self-incrimination. He contended he had been ``prejudged by
this body.''
   Pierce, compelled to appear by a subpoena, accused the
subcommittee of trying to rush him into testifying without adequate
preparation and said he hoped to tell his story later.
   His refusal to testify came at a dramatic meeting of a panel
that has been investigating allegations of billions of dollars
worth of fraud, mismanagement, influence peddling and political
favoritism at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which Pierce headed throughout the Reagan administration.
   Disagreements between the subcommittee and Pierce even extended
to news coverage of the hearing. Pierce invoked House rules that
forced subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., to bar
television, radio and photographic coverage, despite the chairman's
complaint that the move was unwarranted.
   Pierce read a brief statement saying he had not had time to
prepare, did not have the HUD documents he needed and would invoke
his constitutional right not to testify.
   Lantos then posed eight questions to Pierce, some raising new
suggestions of political influence involving HUD and the Reagan
White House.
   Each time Pierce refused to answer.
   ``The subcommittee's desire to rush me through this process,
together with various statements made by members ... leads me to
the painful conclusion that I have been prejudged by this body,''
Pierce said.
   ``Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me and I
have agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments by refusing to answer questions before this
subcommittee,'' he said. ``I trust this subcommittee will remember
that these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and that
they do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing.''
   Paul L. Perito, his attorney, said he hoped Pierce would be
ready to testify on Oct. 27, the next date he has been ordered
before the employment and housing subcommittee of the House
Government Operations Committee.
   But Perito, outside the committee room, told reporters the
subcommittee wanted wouldn't give Pierce a fair hearing and wanted
to ``rush him to judgment.''
   ``They want to try, convict and sentence him, and we will not
let that occur,'' Perito said. ``This man is an innocent man. ...
This man wants very much to tell his story.''
   Perito and Lantos engaged in a brief but heated exchange after
the lawyer attempted to challenge the presence of three lawmakers
who are not members of the subcommittee.
   Lantos said that under House rules Pierce's attorneys had no
right to speak but only to advise their client.
   ``In this hearing, you are in fact a potted plant,'' Lantos told
Perito _ a remark that recalled the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings when
Oliver North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, told a different
investigating committee, ``I am not a potted plant,'' something to
be ignored.
   Pierce himself cited public comments about a need for a special
prosecutor, as well as comments by panel members alleging
inconsistencies in his voluntary testimony last May, as evidence he
had been prejudged.
   However, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Pierce had thrown
``roadblocks in the way of the truth coming out. ... The longer he
does it, the more he digs himself into a hole.''
   A Republican on the subcommittee, Rep. Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, said before the hearing that if Pierce refused to
testify he would support calling for the Justice Department to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary.
Lantos said after the meeting he was studying the issue.
   Pierce delivered the same response to each of the eight
questions posed to him, a brief sentence citing his rights and his
attorney's advice. He sat expressionless, facing the panel. As
members criticized his refusal to testify, he occasionally closed
his eyes and shook his head slightly.
   Lantos said Pierce may have waived his rights not to answer by
testifying voluntarily before the same subcommittee in May. Lantos
told Pierce's lawyers to submit written arguments on the question
within a week.
   Among the questions Lantos put to Pierce were ones about his
approval, over the objection of other HUD officials, of money for a
housing project for elderly people in Durham, N.C.
   Lantos also asked Pierce to explain an announcement by
then-President Reagan of the awarding of a HUD grant for housing
for the elderly during a New Jersey campaign appearance in 1982 on
behalf of the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Millicent
Fenwick.
   The congressman questioned how that announcement was consistent
with Pierce's statement in his May testimony that the housing
program was not run on a political basis.
   `I can't see how it could be any more political,'' Lantos said.
   Lantos showed copies of a Sept. 17, 1982, memo in which Pierce
was informed by a deputy that ``the president, who is en route to
New Jersey, has agreed to fund, with Section 8 new construction
funds,'' the 125-unit housing project for Ewing, N.J.
   The subcommittee chairman said the New Jersey units were taken
away from the Durham project, which was later financed anyway.
   The memo bears Pierce's initials and the handwritten word
``noted.''
   Lantos also showed a report on Reagan's appearance the following
day in the Trenton Times newspaper. The account said the project's
developer didn't know HUD had approved the project until seeing it
on an evening news program, and it quoted Reagan as saying after
his announcement, ``If you don't elect her as senator we'll take it
away.''

   Police are guarding public buildings
following a week-long series of suspicious fires and telephone
threats against schools and school officials.
   ``This might be related to our attempt to break up a drug
pipeline at the school earlier this year,'' said School
Superintendent George French. ``There was an attempt (by drug
dealers) to get a foothold in it, and we've worked very hard to
eliminate drugs,'' he said.
   French also speculated the fires could be reprisals against
administrators for the expulsion of a gun-toting 14-year-old male
student several weeks ago.
   ``We had a student expelled because he brought his father's gun
to school with the intent to kill another student,'' he said. He
declined to identify the minor.
   French said the student fired one shot that hit a portable
classroom.
   ``The consensus is that the fires are all connected,'' said
state chief deputy fire marshal John Chamblee of Jackson.
   ``It's giving us indications that someone has a vendetta or a
loose screw,'' he said of the investigation, adding that his office
will post a $1,000 reward.
   Monday morning, someone pushed a burning wad of paper behind a
ceiling tile at the county's temporary welfare office downtown. The
fire did little damage and was being investigated as arson, said
Hazlehurst Public Safety Director Thomas Quarles.
   Another fire early Sunday gutted a vacant building being rented
by Woodrow Purcer, a candidate in a special election for
supervisor, Quarles said.
   Quarles said the fire is believed to be also arson-related.
   Purcer said: ``It had nothing to do with the election; it just
happened.''
   Four fires set at Hazlehurst Elementary School and Hazlehurst
High School early Thursday and a fire that demolished the Copiah
County Welfare Office early Friday were under investigation as
arson, police said. Authorities said there are no suspects.
   French said he received a series of telephone threats Sunday
night from a woman who threatened to ``destroy the schools'' and
kill him.
   ``This is the first time that I have confirmed that this is a
vendetta,'' French said, adding that he believes the threats and
fires are the result of a grudge against the school administration.
   ``In the second call, they said for me to meet them somewhere,
and they were going to kill me ... nothing but me,'' he said. ``And
in the third call, they said they were going to kill me and just
hung up.''
   A bomb squad combed the campuses and the athletic field for
explosives before a home football game on Friday, French said.
   French said authorities are working around the clock to protect
the campuses. And Quarles said city and county law officers are
guarding public buildings from dusk to dawn.

<TEXT>
   Relatives rushed across the border from
Cambodia on Tuesday to greet their sons, fathers and husbands
returning from Vietnam's nearly 11-year-old war in the neighboring
country.
   Vietnam said the withdrawal marked the end of its military
involvement in Cambodia, but guerrillas claim thousands of
Vietnamese soldiers remain, wearing Cambodian uniforms.
   Schoolchildren, peasants and city dwellers lined Highway 1,
waving flags and tree branches at the thousands of passing troops
in a government-orchestrated welcoming ceremony.
   ``My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' one soldier said as
he held hands with his spouse, who dashed the last few yards to
embrace her husband.
   Vietnam had promised it would have all of its 26,000 troops out
of Cambodia by Sept. 26, and the withdrawal sparked fears that
Cambodia will slide into protracted civil war as government troops
try to fight the three-party guerrilla coalition without Vietnamese
help.
   Vietnam's invasion in December 1978 ousted the Khmer Rouge
regime, which had ruled Cambodia since 1975. During that time, the
Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands, practicing a radical
brand of agrarian communism. Now the Khmer Rouge is the strongest
of the three-party guerrilla front.
   Guerrilla radio reports monitored in Bangkok on Tuesday claimed
resistance forces had seized two more areas in a gem-rich region in
western Cambodia, killing some Vietnamese troops in the fighting.
   Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh recently confirmed that
guerrillas held some areas near Pailin.
   At Moc Bai, a Vietnamese cultural troop serenaded hundreds of
soldiers with popular tunes as they sat in a football-field size
buffer zone between the two countries. Several military officers
gave patriotic speeches, praising the ``solidarity of the
Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.''
   Then, with the whine of a motorcycle siren, the convoy began.
   Led by an American-made jeep and Soviet-made armored personnel
carriers, the soldiers scurried into trucks and roared home,
followed by trucks of their comrades.
   ``I am so happy to be leaving Cambodia,'' a soldier from Can Tho
province said as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair.
   Many men said they were worried that after receiving a hero's
welcome, they will have trouble finding jobs. Hanoi has demobilized
more than a half-million soldiers in recent years, Gen. Tran Cong
Man, editor of Vietnam's official army newspaper, said in a recent
interview with The Associated Press. Unemployment is also high.
   Freshly painted posters praising Vietnam's army lined Highway 1.
The narrow, potholed highway was one of the main invasion routes
used by Vietnamese troops almost 11 years ago when they poured into
Cambodia.
   In addition to the 10,000 troops at Moc Bai, Vietnamese soldiers
crossed over at port towns on the Mekong River and at several other
locations overland. Logistics and artillery divisions, along with
wounded soldiers, crossed the border at Samat, several miles north
of Moc Bai. Tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived at the
port town of Rach Gai.
   Outside of Moc Bai, the convoy stopped and started as local
villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer the soldiers.
   At Go Dau, a toothless farmer ran to one truck and tossed the
soldiers packets of rice and pork wrapped in banana leaves.
   ``Thank you, grandfather,'' one soldier said. Many of the troops
had spent the night on Highway 1, sleeping under trucks.
   State-run television Tuesday night devoted a lengthy program to
the pullout as did the newspaper of the Vietnamese Communist Party.
In an editorial the paper said Vietnam's ``special'' relationship
with Cambodia would continue. Cambodian resistance groups have
claimed Vietnam wants to colonize Cambodia.
   In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese government officials confirmed
that Vietnam and Cambodia would renegotiate their treaty of ``peace
and friendship,'' imposed on the Cambodian government soon after it
was installed in Phnom Penh.
   The treaty, which is basically a mutual defense pact, conflicts
with Cambodia's stated goal of neutrality. Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen had earlier said he hoped the treaty would be renegotiated
soon.
   However, the officials said such renegotiation would not affect
Vietnamese military support of the Phnom Penh government. They said
such support, through arms transfers, advice and intelligence,
would last as long as nations such as China and Thailand continue
to support the guerrilla resistance front. The Soviet Union is
Cambodia's main arms supplier.

<HEAD>No Agreement on Catastrophic Insurance Repeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee found no
agreement Tuesday on a new plan to prevent repeal of catastrophic
medical insurance for retirees.
   ``There obviously is not bipartisan support for any proposal at
this point,'' committee chairman Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told
reporters after a closed session.
   ``The administration says it is for the (new) package but I
don't see any Republican members for the package,'' he said.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said he saw signs members might
be drawing closer to a compromise. Bentsen, he said, ``is swimming
uphill and he ought to have Republicans, he ought to have the
president in the boat with him.''
   The year-old program, designed to prevent a serious illness from
financially ruining retirees, is under attack from many older
Americans.
   Some object because they already have catastrophic coverage and
some higher-income retirees are upset because they must pay a large
share of the program's cost.
   The House Ways and Means Committee has agreed to shift more of
the cost to those with lower incomes, allow retirees to drop
coverage if they also give up Medicare Part B (physicians' fees),
and to scale back reimbursement for prescriptions.
   There are indications the House may vote instead to repeal the
program.
   The latest proposal considered by the Finance Committee would
cut the $800 maximum annual surtax paid by higher-income retirees
to $400; slow scheduled increases in the $4-a-month flat fee for
catastrophic coverage that most retirees pay; permit beneficiaries
to drop catastrophic protection if they also give up Medicare Part
B; require retirees to pay more of physicians' fees before the new
protection kicks in; and eliminate coverage for most prescription
drugs.
   Another element being considered by the panel would pay some
costs of the program by requiring that all state and local
government employees pay the share of Social Security taxes that
finances Medicare.
   Present law requires that state and local employees hired on or
after April 1, 1986, pay the Medicare tax, which this year is 1.45
percent of the first $48,000 of annual earnings.
   About 3 million employees would face the tax increase under the
Finance Committee proposal.

<HEAD>TV Fans Suffer Withdrawal Pangs After Marathon Soap Opera Runs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA SMILEY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just as American television viewers are
beginning a new season of J.R. Ewing intrigues and Angela Channing
plots, their fans here are suffering the pain of soap opera
withdrawal.
   It's a hard comedown for viewers who for the past few months
have enjoyed an almost nonstop run of ``Dallas,'' ``Dynasty,''
``Knots Landing'' and ``Falcon Crest.''
   Channel 55, Bahrain's government-run English-language television
network, presents the shows nightly instead of once a week, as in
the United States. This means an entire season's 30 installments
are shown in one month.
   Hamad Al-Mutlak, director of foreign programming, said this has
enabled the network to catch up with the series in the States,
whereas they previously lagged as much as two seasons behind.
   ``Falcon Crest'' ended this month with Angela Channing's claim
on the Tuscany Valley vineyard again in doubt and her son Richard
headed for jail. Because the shows must be sent off for subtitling
in Arabic, it will be sometime next summer before local viewers
find out what happens next.
   While dedicated fans may look in vain for acceptable
substitutes, the end of the American soaps does not mean television
in this desert region has become a wasteland.
   The TV fare in the Persian Gulf, in fact, might be considered
couch potato heaven, with perhaps more to choose from than in most
countries, including the United States.
   Top documentaries and educational programs _ from American
public television's ``Smithsonian World'' to Britain's ``All the
World's A Stage'' _ run in prime time, along with BBC Shakespearan
dramas, ``Sixty Minutes,'' sitcoms, cop shows, wildlife programs,
movies and mini-series from the United States, Britain, Canada and
Australia.
   Foreign TV addicts might find the periodic ``prayer
intermissions'' on gulf networks a bit disruptive, and they might
be annoyed by the odd transitions that result from Moslem censors
excising scenes of kissing and what one local TV producer called
``the passionate stuff between the sheets.''
   On the other hand, there's hardly more than a hint of
advertising.
   Ads on Bahrain TV run in two-minute commercial breaks once or
twice an evening.
   Viewers here may also watch TV from Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia _
even from Iran, depending on their antennae and the region's
freakish atmospheric conditions.
   The other Arabic countries also have a wide range of programming
for foreign as well as local viewers.
   Saudi Arabia's Aramco station, which basically serves the oil
company's foreign employees, brings top sports events from abroad.
It is currently showing this year's National Basketball Association
finals.
   The Saudi channels offer news in Arabic, English and French, and
last week gave their late night audiences the videotaped
confessions, with English voiceover, of 16 Kuwaitis convicted of
terrorist bombings in Mecca _ just hours after they were all
beheaded.
   Americans make up a relatively small segment of the foreign
audience. But since ``Dallas'' was first shown here in 1975, the
U.S. soaps, with their fast-paced plots and lively characters in
luxurious settings, are the most popular programs, Mutlak said.
   By contrast, one local TV critic complained of being bored by
the Australian soap ``Sons and Daughters'' because ``all the action
seems to take place in somebody's kitchen.'' Mutlak said many
viewers agreed, and it won't be renewed.
   When on the tube, the American soaps are even bad news for
Bahrain's video shops _ accounting for a 25 percent drop in
rentals, according to Ahmed Rashid, manager of a local video
distributor.
   He said that after watching ``Knots Landing'' or ``Falcon
Crest'' from 9 to 10 p.m., ``people are too tired to watch a
video.''

   Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin took a hard
line Tuesday at his first news conference, insisting that those
arrested in the spring democracy movement were criminals and
refusing to rule out more executions.
   Asked by a reporter if the ``Tiananmen tragedy'' could have been
avoided, Jiang said: ``We believe it was not a tragedy.
   ``Tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the
Communist Party leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist
system,'' he said.
   Premier Li Peng, who also took part in the news conference,
reaffirmed the party's determination to end rampant corruption and
said new limits on official perks would be announced in a few days.
   The 62-year-old Jiang, whose highest previous post was head of
the Shanghai party committee, was catapulted into the national
leadership in June after soldiers retook Beijing's Tiananmen Square
by force from student-led pro-democracy protesters, killing
hundreds and possibly thousands of people en route to the square.
   His predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, was accused of supporting the
protests and ousted.
   Jiang took a mild tone toward Zhao on Tuesday, saying he was
leading a ``comfortable life'' and receiving full salary. He said
Zhao was still under investigation but did not suggest he might
face further punishment or be put on trial.
   The unusual news conference, for both local and foreign
reporters, appeared intended to demonstrate the solidity of the new
party leadership in time for the 40th anniversary of the founding
of Communist China on Oct. 1.
   When Zhao took office in 1987, he was the first party leader to
hold a news conference with foreign reporters in more than a decade.
   But while Zhao shook hands and joked with the reporters, Jiang
sat behind a table in the Great Hall of the People and answered
most questions with well-worn phrases from official speeches and
editorials.
   He appeared relaxed, however, and ventured a few personal
remarks, complimenting two young Taiwanese reporters on their
Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is the official language of both the
mainland and Taiwan, but many older Chinese speak regional dialects.
   In an apparent effort to emphasize a collective leadership,
Jiang was joined by Li and the four other members of the Politburo
Standing Committee, the party's top body. Each answered at least
one question.
   Song Ping, in charge of party organization, and Yao Yilin, in
charge of economic planning, read their answers, indicating the
questions they were asked were arranged in advance.
   The leaders' comments held no surprises, reiterating the party
emphasis since June on opposing Western ``bourgeois'' influences
and promoting traditional socialist values.
   Jiang said the party was understanding toward most students and
others who took part in the massive pro-democracy marches of the
spring and would seek to ``unify and educate them.''
   ``The youth are the hope of the future,'' he said. ``We are full
of warmth toward them...But there is no denying that there have
been some conspirators who acted with ulterior motives to overthrow
the Communist Party and the government. They have violated Chinese
law.''
   Asked if he could rule out that dissidents who advocated
non-violence, such as student leader Wang Dan, would be executed,
Jiang said it was up to the courts to decide.
   ``We cannot substitute the party for the government or for the
judicial system,'' he said.
   At least 12 executions have been reported of people clearly
accused of taking part in the pro-democracy protests in some form.
   Jiang confirmed that the party's Central Committee, its main
policy-making body, soon will hold its first plenary meeting since
June but said no date has been set. He said the committee will
discuss economic problems.
   He did not say if the retirement of senior leader Deng Xiaoping
will also be discussed. Deng, 85, stepped down from most of his
official posts in 1987, and has suggested several times that he
also resign as chairman of the state and party military
commissions, Jiang said.
   ``But much is at stake, so it still depends on the decision of
the party and the state to decide the appropriate time at which
Comrade Deng Xiaoping can retire and the person who might succeed
him,'' Jiang said.
   Several top officials, including Jiang, President Yang Shangkun
and Defense Minister Qin Jiwei are reportedly vying for Deng's
posts.
   Deng's actual power as key policy-maker far exceeds the scope of
his military posts, however, and he is likely to continue as
China's supreme leader even if he resigns from them.
   Jiang said some have pointed out that the last two party chiefs
_ Zhao and Hu Yaobang _ both lost their posts in disgrace for
failing to take a stand against liberalism. But he declined to
assess his chances for staying in office.

   Fire spread through several floors of a luxury

   Guests at the Dan Caesarea Hotel, on the Mediterranean south of
Haifa, were forced to flee the eight-story building. The blaze
damaged 50 rooms, said Fire Chief Yossi Levy.
   Levy said the fire started on the second floor and quickly
spread through the building to the fifth story. He said the cause
was under investigation.
   The injuries were described as light.
   The Dan Caesarea Hotel has a five-star rating and is next to the
Roman ruins of Caesarea, the Romans' capital in Palestine for about
500 years.
   Nine workers and two Israeli tourists were injured in the hotel,
a spokesman at Hillel Yaafe Hospital in nearby Hadera said. Most of
the injured suffered from smoke inhalation.

<HEAD>Rural County Calls on Capitol Muscle to Save Doomed Military Base</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with defeat of audit provision.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rural roads of Illinois are a world away
from the shiny floors of the Capitol, but folks who want to save a
military base understand one thing about Washington: clout can
carry a price.
   So they went after some, but lost a vote in the Senate, anyway.
   Residents of Champaign County, population 150,000, hired an
influential lobbying firm _ Patton, Boggs and Blow _ to help them
as senators considered a $288 billion defense bill.
   They hoped the Senate would retain a provision in the giant
defense bill ordering an audit of the costs of closing the bases.
But the provision was defeated today, 86-14.
   The version of the 1990 defense bill approved by the
Appropriations Committee said no base could be closed unless an
audit found that the costs of dismantling it would be recovered
within six years.
   The county and the cities of Champaign and Rantoul chipped in
$30,000, and readers responding to a full-page advertisement in the
local newspaper also sent contributions. Businesses, aware of
Chanute Air Force Base's impact on the area's fragile economy,
joined the effort, too.
   ``The role of our lobbyists is to do whatever they can _ that is
fair and appropriate _ to turn this thing around,'' says Carl
Webber, an attorney and chairman of the Urbana Chamber of Commerce.
   ``When you consider the unfairness of the decision and include
with that the phenomenal impact on this whole area, the amount
we're spending on lobbyists is a drop in a bucket,'' said Webber.
   ``We're not ever going to say die.''
   The decision to hire a lobbyist has sparked something of a
debate among lawmakers who represent the area.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said he doubted it would make much
difference.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., seeking re-election, said the Chanute
forces need all the help they can get, adding, ``I wish we lived in
a pure society where no one would have to hire lobbyists. There is
no question a lobbyist can do some good.''
   Some in Congress, however, wondered if it was too late.
   ``We are just concerned with the ability of paid lobbyists to
turn a bad situation around in the bottom of the ninth inning,''
said David Almy, spokesman for Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., whose
district includes Chanute. ``As paid advocates of our constituents
we don't want to see them getting less than their money's worth.''
Madigan favors saving the base.
   Lobbyist Tom Boggs, son of Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., did not
return phone calls requesting comment on the lobbying effort.
   Chanute AFB, about 120 miles south of Chicago, has about 8,500
military and civilian personnel and provides training in such
fields as firefighting and aircraft and missile maintenance.
   Last December, when an independent commission said the
government should close 86 bases and realign 59 others, Chanute was
on the list, cited for a shortage of buildings and recreational
facilities and inadequate housing.
   The conclusion by the Commission on Base Closing and Realignment
stunned many lawmakers, especially Madigan, who said the government
had spent $150 million on new buildings there during the last seven
years.
   Chanute defenders claim the commission made glaring errors. A
university study said closing the base could devastate the area.
   ``Hiring those lobbyists doesn't do anything more,'' Dixon said.
``Everything they talked to me about I've done.''
   But Dixon added: ``The firm is a good one. ... When you're
fighting for your life, you do everything you can do. If you live
in the city of Rantoul and you have a business, this is a serious
thing.''

   A judge in the city of Medellin dropped
assassination and other charges against the two reputed leaders of
Colombia's international drug network because of lack of evidence,
a Colombia newspaper reported today.
   The military, meanwhile, imposed heavy security on the Caribbean
tourist city of Cartagena today after another bomb blast blamed on
drug traffickers killed two people and injured one at a Hilton
hotel.
   The newspaper El Tiempo said a Medellin judge on Monday dropped
charges against Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria and Jose Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, alleged leaders of the Medellin-based drug
operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the United States.
   The two men are on the U.S. Justice Department list of 12 key
drug figures wanted for prosecution in the United States.
   The president of Colombia's House of Representatives, Norberto
Morales, said last week that the two men contacted him and said
they would be willing to move their drug operations out of Colombia
in return for an end to the government's crackdown on trafficking.
   Escobar and Rodriguez had been charged with complicity in the
kidnapping last year of Andres Pastrana, who was a candidate for
mayor of Bogota. Pastrana was freed in an army raid and went on to
be elected mayor of the capital.
   Escobar and Rodriguez also were charged with planning the
assassination of Colombia's attorney general, Carlos Hoyos, on Jan.
25 in Medellin.
   El Tiempo said Judge Francisco Cardenas cited lack of evidence
in dropping the charges against the two men. None of the reputed
leaders of Colombia's drug operations has ever been prosecuted.
   The dropping of charges has no effect on U.S. extradition orders.
   Also today, a Cabinet minister was to meet with representatives
of the country's 4,600 judges in an effort to head off a strike
protesting what the judges call inadequate government protection
from drug gangs.
   Meanwhile, a guerrilla group that is about to sign a peace
agreement with the government of President Virgilio Barco said drug
traffickers should be pardoned, daily newspapers reported.
   The April 19 Movement, known as M-19, reportedly issued a
communique at its base camp saying peace talks should be expanded
to include the drug traffickers.
   The traffickers declared war on the Colombian government after
the government launched a crackdown following the assassination of
a leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug. 18.
   The guerrilla communique was signed by the rebel group's chiefs
of staff, Carlos Pizarro Leon-Gomez, Antonio Navarro Wolf, Otty
Patino and German Rojas Nino, the newspapers El Espectador and El
Tiempo said.
   The signing of a peace agreement by the guerrillas and the
government has been postponed each of the last two days due to
last-minute changes in the agreement. Pardoning the traffickers is
not one of the guerillas' demands, the newspapers said.
   The news conference was held at the guerrilla base camp in the
tiny village of Santo Domingo in the Andes mountains in southwest
Colombia.
   The April 19 Movement takes its name after the date of a 1970
presidential election that dissidents said was fraudulent.
   The group seized Colombia's Justice Palace in Bogota in 1985.
Ninety-five people were killed, most in an army assault that ended
the takeover.
   There are six guerrilla groups in Colombia with an estimated
10,000 combatants. The government is not negotiating with any other
guerrilla group.
   Colombian marines, army troops and national police patrolled
Cartagena today, searching cars at roadblocks and frisking
pedestrians, said Col. Luis Herrera, chief of the national police
in Cartagena.
   The dead at the hotel were Colombian doctors attending a medical
convention, Herrera said.
   He said no one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   The hotel bomb and another that exploded at a Cartagena bank
Monday were the first bombings in that city since the drug war
began. One person was injured by the bomb Monday night at the bank,
Herrera said.
   A third bomb exploded Monday night in Bogota at a government
electric company's billing office, the national police said. No
injuries were reported.
   Many of the bombings since mid-August have been against
government-owned banks and utilities. The majority owner of the
Cartagena Hilton is the Colombian government's National Tourism
Council.
   The Hilton's 1,500 guests were evacuated to other Cartagena
hotels, Col. Herrera said.
   Thousands of U.S., Canadian and other foreign tourists visit
Cartagena and its beaches each year. The city also is a regular
stop for Caribbean cruise ships.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Liberal Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday adopted liberal
laws that guarantee the rights of Hungarians to travel abroad and
even to emigrate.
   The session that opened Tuesday is to decide a series of key
bills designed to pave the way for next year's elections, the first
in more than 40 years that will be freely contested by more than
one party.
   The volume of legislation led deputies to vote for extending the
session past Friday, when it had been set to end.
   The house also was to review changes in the penal code this week
but postponed until Oct. 17 discussion of other key bills,
including a law on the functioning of political parties, an
electoral law and constitutional changes that will remove
references to the leading role of the Communist Party.
   The Communists have committed themselves to multiparty elections
and have pledged to go into opposition if they lose.
   More than 70 percent of the 387 parliament deputies are
Communist Party members.
   In the past, Hungary's Parliament met four times a year for less
than a week, essentially rubber-stamping the Communist government's
policies.
   In recent months, however, independents and some reform-minded
Communist members of Parliament have sparked considerable debate
and even forced revisions on some key legislation.
   The new laws adopted Tuesday lift most restrictions on travel,
meaning that Hungarians no longer need to seek permission from
authorities for foreign travel or emigration, and that Hungarians
who emigrated _ even those who were forced to because of their
political views _ may return at any time.
   The laws take effect Jan. 1.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath told a news confernce after the
bills were adopted that ``Freedom of movement is no longer
dependent on the arbitrariness of the authorities.''
   He said the new bills were in line with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
   Hungary's emerging liberal policies were demonstrated by the
government's decision to remove the barbed wire and other obstacles
along its western border with Austria, and to allow thousands of
East Germans seeking to emigrate to the West to cross legally into
Austria.
   The decision this month to let the East Germans go has deeply
angered Hungary's hard-line East bloc allies.
   Also Tuesday, four opposition members became the first freely
elected non-Communists to take their seats in the house since the
Communists consolidated power in 1948. They won a majority vote in
recent freely contested by-elections.
   ``Never in the past 42 years was being an MP such an honor,''
said Gabor Roszik, one of the oposition members.
   ``We can all be proud regardless of how we got here, to be able
to participate in this transition,'' he said.
   Roszik, who was accompanied to the session by a group of
supporters waving Hungarian flags, said the participation of the
four opposition members marked ``one of the most significant steps
of the revolution under way in Hungary, as we move from dictatorial
socialism to democracy.''
   The fall session of Parliament was marked by another first. An
electronic voting system was installed to ensure an accurate count.
   In the past, voting was conducted by a show of hands, often
leading to discrepancies and calls for recounts.

   A 15-year-old ICBM
blasted off Tuesday in the predawn sky for a 30-minute test flight
of the Minuteman 3 missile system, the Air Force said.
   The missile delivered unarmed re-entry vehicles to a target
4,200 miles out in the Pacific. The flight ended with the vehicles
splashing down in a missile range in the Marshall Islands.
   The launch, visible to a wide area of California, was a test of
a missile taken from the Strategic Air Command inventory of
operational intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   ``It was a successful launch,'' said base spokesman Ernest
Dawson. ``The two unarmed re-entry vehicles came down without a
hitch.''
   It was the 140th launch in a series of Strategic Air Command
tests of the Minuteman 3 system.

<TEXT>
   Vandals damaged the remains of a 13th-century
Carmelite monastery in northern Israel, apparently to protest a
controversial Carmelite convent near the Auschwitz death camp in
Poland, an official said Tuesday.
   Shalom Yankelevitch, commissioner of antiquities for the city of
Haifa, said the vandalism followed reports that Jewish religious
extremists had threatened Carmelite nuns carrying out an
archaeological dig at the monastery.
   The vandalism was discovered last week.
   Sister Damien, a Carmelite nun from Salt Lake City who is
leading the dig, told Israel television her order has always
opposed having nuns pray at the Roman Catholic convent on the edge
of Auschwitz.
   ``So for people to hurt our ruins here to try to make the
sisters come out, they are hurting the people who are trying to get
(the nuns) out,'' she said. Jewish leaders say the convent, with
its 12-foot-high cross, is offensive because of the presence of
Christian symbols at a place where 2.5 million Jews were killed by
the Nazis in World War II.
   Yankelevitch said the damage to the convent near Haifa came
after an article appeared in a local newspaper saying anonymous
religious groups demanded the nuns delay their dig until the
convent at Auschwitz is moved.
   The vandals caused extensive damage, Yankelevitch said.
   ``They toppled the entrance arch into the...cathedral, and the
arch leading to the 2nd floor of a sideyard, and stone steps. All
this from the 13th century was damaged and broken,'' he said.
   A group of American archaelogists has been excavating for two
years at the one-acre site on biblical Mount Carmel.
   The dig has uncovered new parts of the well-preserved Carmelite
cathedral and a fortress and ancient water system that are part of
an entire monastery complex.
   The Carmelite nuns are trying to prove that the site dates back
to the 5th century, which would predate by 100 years any other
Christain order on Mount Carmel.
   Mount Carmel is the spiritual center of Carmelites throughout
the world, and Carmelites here have written letters to Israeli
newspapers calling for moving the convent from Auschwitz. Some have
traveled to Auschwitz to press for transferring the nuns.
   Yankelevitch said he believed there was a connection between the
vandalism and threats by religious groups, but he did not rule out
other possibilities. The investigation is in police hands, he said.
   The damage was reported as the controversy over the convent in
Auschwitz seemed to be easing. Pope John Paul II said last week
that he believed the nuns should be moved to an interfaith prayer
center to be built in accordance with a 1987 agreement between
Jewish and Catholic officials.
   The statement overcame opposition by Polish primate Jozef Glemp
and Polish Catholics, who have argued the nuns should be allowed to
remain because they cause no harm and because many Christians also
were killed at Auschwitz.
   In the Netherlands, a Dutch Catholic University on Tuesday
canceled an invitation to Glemp, citing what it called his
``harrowing'' anti-Jewish statements.
   The Catholic University in Nijmegen, in the eastern Netherlands,
said: ``The (university) board is aware of Cardinal Glemp's
statement's on the Jews and the Jewish people ... and distances
itself emphatically from those statements.''
   In an Aug. 26 sermon, Glemp accused Jews of provoking
anti-Semitism in Poland and of speaking to the Poles as ``a nation
elevated over all others.''

   When John Ring showed up at his corner grocery,
singing ``I'm Just Wild About Harry'' in praise of his favorite
cat, it marked his chief contact with the world for the day. His
brother, Vincent, was never seen at all.
   It was only when their equally reclusive sister, Marie, died
last week that the brothers were delivered from a life in a filthy
home without running water or electricity. But now they face an
uncertain future.
   Said Matthew Ryan, a neighbor since the Rings moved to the
working-class Boston neighborhood in the 1950s: ``I couldn't
believe it. Who could get by today without electricity and gas and
water? ... I would have helped them, but they weren't people who
wanted you to get involved.''
   Gerri Abban, the cashier at nearby Bell's Market, says the
plight of the Rings was obvious but the best way to help them was
not.
   The market's owner since 1956, Matthew Cohen, gave John
discounts and looked the other way when one of his checks bounced.
But the Rings would not let anyone in the house, and social workers
and priests responded to Ms. Abban's pleas for help by noting that
the family had a right to privacy.
   ``I sold them charcoal in the winter so they could heat the
house,'' Ms. Abban said. ``I sold them rubbing alcohol, five
bottles at a time, so they could cook. I sold them bottle after
bottle of Anacin because they'd get wicked headaches from the smell
in the house. Paper plates, paper cups, bottled water. It was
unbelievable.''
   The isolation ended last week when John, 59, called police to
report that his 58-year-old sister's pulse was weak. Police said
they arrived to find her dead, and John and 62-year-old Vincent in
poor mental condition.
   The brothers refused to leave the house, though it reeked of
waste from the Rings and their two dozen cats. They were sent to
Boston City Hospital for evaluation, and a hospital spokeswoman
would say only that they were in stable condition.
   In an interview published Tuesday, John Ring said neither he,
his brother nor his sister had worked since the 1950s or early
'60s, choosing instead to live with their parents, who died more
than a decade ago.
   ``The cats took all our money ... cost us $60 a week worth of
cat food. That's why we couldn't fix the place up,'' Ring said.
``But we're going to now.''
   Asked why he didn't accept help, Ring said: ``I didn't want to
bother anybody. But pretty soon Vincent and I will be well again
and we'll go back and fix the house up. I'm sure that everything
will be fine as soon as we get out of the hospital.''
   City officials say however that the house is in such bad shape
it has been condemned. And the Animal Rescue League came for the
cats.
   Cohen, proprietor of Bell's since 1956, said the Rings didn't
have much, but they received some sort of veterans assistance and
weren't penniless. They paid with personal checks that occasionally
bounced, and Cohen gave them unofficial discounts.
   ``I'm not saying how many (checks bounced),'' Cohen said.
``Let's just say I've got a few in my file.''
   ``If John didn't take his medication, he went wild,'' Cohen
said. ``When he'd come down to the store to buy, he'd stuff his
pockets, he'd throw things around and yell at people. We understood
him. We did the best we could. We got him home.''
   Neighbors said John and his sister went to church each Sunday.
Cohen recalled Marie as ``a very fine lady, always well-spoken. She
seemed to be well-read and her whole life was taking care of her
two brothers. It's a mystery to me why, but she did it.''
   As for the other brother, ``I don't know anything about
Vincent,'' Cohen said. ``I saw the man once in a flashing instant
when I went to the house.'' John Ring said his brother had been
wounded in World War II.
   Cohen gave up trying to understand why the Rings lived the way
they did. ``You had a good daddy. I had a good daddy,'' he said.
``We can't all be lucky.''
   ``Everybody has a right to their privacy. It was my business and
it wasn't my business. I sent a plumber up there, I sent an
electrician, and they couldn't get in.''
   Ryan, a retired union leader, said that he thought Vincent had
died back in the early 1970s. Then some years ago, a fire broke out
on the street, and he saw a man with a beard down to his belt and a
blanket around him.
   ``I said, `Who is that?' And someone said, `That's Vincent.' I
never believed there was (a third person) in there.''

   Three couples have been declared winners in
the first annual Great American Kiss-Off, but their lips are sealed
about what they'll take home for their efforts.
   The six contestants agreed to divvy up the $10,000 top prize
after smooching for 42 days then hiring a lawyer to legally unlock
their lips.
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' Fernando Gonzales said Tuesday, one
day after all parties embraced the pact.
   He and his wife, Karen, were declared the official first-place
finishers after they and two other couples outlasted 11 other pairs
who entered the contest sponsored by a furniture company. The
company agreed to let the three top couples split the $10,000 as
they pleased and without revealing how.
   ``We thought it was going to be a two-week thing, but it turned
into a marathon,'' said Gonzales. ``I'm recovered now. But it still
feels like I'm kissing. ... It's like when you've been wearing a
hat for four or five weeks and then take it off. The hat still
feels like it's on.''
   But Gonzales, 39, said he still kissed his 36-year-old wife and
mother of their five children good night.
   ``I'm not tired of kissing her,'' he said. ``I think everyone
decided we should be the winners because they realized we could go
on the longest.''
   Gonzales, who is unemployed, said he survived financially
because he owned a tile fitting business in California before
moving to Fernley, Nev., in 1985.
   Reno attorney Pat Cashill said he was hired by parents of the
other two couples in their late teens and early 20s to help end the
contest so their children could get on with their lives.
   ``These people were really caught up in a horrible situation,''
Cashill said. ``It was like they were in bondage. They wouldn't
quit; $10,000 is a lot of money.''
   Under the agreement, the Gonzales couple got the deed to an
Idaho time-share condominium, which was the first-place prize along
with the money.
   The declared second-place finishers and winners of an
expenses-paid trip to Mexico were Lloyd and Laura Gubler of Reno.
Bret Watson and Lori Block of Reno claimed the third-place prize of
new living room furniture.
   The pact to end the Kiss-Off began developing Friday and the
contest was suspended pending the outcome of negotiations.
   Butch Lynn, a publicist for the Kiss-Off, said the furniture
company was a bit disappointed in the outcome of the contest.
   ``It was fairly anticlimactic,'' Lynn said. ``We were hoping
there would be a big winner and a ceremony with champagne to hand
out the $10,000 check.''
   Gubler expects to go back to his father's auto body shop, while
Watson will resume his career as a financial planner and Ms. Block
will look for a new job, having lost hers at a bank, Lynn said.
   Contest organizers thought the competition would last only about
two weeks, but relatively easy rules allowed the contest to
continue.
   Couples had to kiss for 12 hours each day, from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m., in the furniture store's parking lot, with five-minute breaks
each hour. On Aug. 26, three competing couples, including the
Gublers, married in a triple wedding ceremony.

   A supporter of teen-aged killer Craig Price
has been charged after crashing her car into the house where three
of Price's victims lived, police said Tuesday.
   Karen Mobley, 20, of Providence was charged with disorderly
conduct, malicious damage and reckless driving after crashing into
the home of Joan Heaton on Monday, police Capt. John Lytle said.
   She was held overnight at the state Institute of Mental Health.
Her arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday.
   Mobley already faces a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of
justice for allegedly giving police false information that led them
away from Price, police said. She was free on personal recognizance
from that charge when the latest incident occurred.
   Price, 15, admitted in Family Court last week that he killed
Heaton and her two young daughters on Sept. 1, and also admitted
slaying Rebecca Spencer in 1987. All the victims lived within a
block of Price in Warwick.
   Price has been sentenced to the state Training School, Rhode
Island's juvenile prison, until his 21st birthday, the most severe
sentence he could receive because of his age.

   Urging closer scrutiny of Third World defense
budgets, World Bank President Barber Conable said Tuesday poor
countries spent more on the military than on health and education
combined at times during the past decade.
   ``But let us hope that in the changing political climate of the
1990s, resources are increasingly allocated to more productive
purposes,'' he said in an address prepared for the Bank's annual
meeting.
   As a whole, low income countries currently spend around 20
percent of their funds on defense, Conable said. Despite cuts in
other necessities, ``the $200 billion which the developing world
spends annually on the military has largely been protected,'' he
said.
   The United States spent about $290 billion on the military in
fiscal year 1989, or about 29 percent of the national budget.
   Conable said it's time for ``developing countries on one side,
and their arms suppliers on the other,'' to ``adapt to a world
where budgets are tight.
   ``It is important to place military spending on the same footing
as other fiscal decisions, to examine possible trade-offs more
systematically, and to explore ways to bring military spending into
better balance with development priorities,'' he said.
   Every country has the right and duty to defend itself, and ``in
evaluating military expenditures governments should be realistic,
but they also should remember the human consequences of these
choices,'' said Conable, who as a former U.S. Congressman had some
experience with guns-vs.-butter trade-offs.
   Military spending is ``a sensitive component of the fiscal
problem'' that can no longer be neglected, Conable said, because
arms are often a prime source of external debt, accounting for a
third or more of the interest due by some major Third World
debt-ridden countries.

<HEAD>World's Written Heritage Turning to Dust With Alarming Speed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's written heritage is turning to dust
with alarming speed and newer books are among the first to crumble,
said specialists gathered Tuesday to discuss book preservation.
   ``Sixteen million volumes and manuscripts in the Library of
Congress will require treatment to prevent total deterioration,''
said preservationist Dick Miller. ``Two-and-a-half million books in
the New York Public Library (system) turn to dust every year.''
   Miller and other preservationists are members of a library task
for the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, an organization of
Midwestern universities and libraries. The task force began meeting
Monday to consider various preservation techniques.
   Miller, book preservation director for Akzo Chemicals Inc. in
Chicago, wants to seal books in a gas chamber, while Richard D.
Smith of Wei T'o Associates Inc. in Matteson, Ill., wants to douse
them with solvents.
   Other possibilities are water-based baths and aerosol sprays.
   Until one system is proved best, laboratory director Mimi
Lampert of Chicago's Newberry Library will continue to preserve the
private institution's rarest books page-by-page, and to lock the
rest in darkness _ in a 10-level, windowless, climate-controlled
tower.
   ``In essence, we keep our books in a huge thermos bottle,'' she
said.
   Few public institutions, however, could afford to adopt the
Newberry's measures, which even include white-gloved page-turners
who are the only people allowed to touch certain books.
   Studies in New York and the Netherlands proved that atmospheric
pollutants have a role in the deterioration of books, but Ms.
Lampert said the main culprit is the acid content of the paper
itself.
   The deterioration first sets in as yellowing and soon progresses
to brittleness. Finally, the paper simply crumbles.
   Ironically, the destructive process works faster in newer books,
preservationists said. Books printed before 1850 are relatively
immune because the linen rag paper used in earlier centuries was
acid-free.
   Modern mass publishing involves cheaper wood-pulp paper, which
contains acid. Neutralizing acid is the key to preservation, Miller
said.
   Miller's company, using a process developed at the Library of
Congress, seals books in a vacuum chamber, where they are permeated
with vapors of diethyl zinc. Zinc oxide then binds with the paper,
neutralizing the acid.
   ``It also makes the paper fluoresce bright orange under
ultraviolet light, so it can also be used as an identification and
anti-theft device for rare books,'' Miller said.
   The process was first demonstrated in a kitchen pressure cooker,
but is now done in chambers developed by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, Miller said.
   Smith's process, developed with the National Archives of Canada,
soaks books in a solution of magnesium carbonate, liquified Freon
and wood alcohol. His company also produces an aerosol spray for
use by private book collectors.
   ``None of the systems are going to save paper that is already
brittle,'' Ms. Lampert said.

<UNK>Father's Will Says Zola Budd Unwelcome at His Funeral</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slain father of track star
Zola Budd said in his will that his three daughters were not
welcome at his funeral, which was scheduled for Wednesday, the
independent South African Press Association reported.
   Frank Budd, who had been estranged from his family for several
years, was fatally shot Thursday at a farmhouse outside the central
city of Bloemfontein where he lived alone. A man doing construction
work on the farm is being held in connection with the killing.
   Budd's fomer wife, Tossie, and their son, Quintus, were expected
to be at the funeral, but it was not known if Ms. Budd and her
sisters would attend, according to the news agency.
   Budd, 59, did not attend Ms. Budd's April 15 wedding in
Bloemfontein, saying he was not invited.
   Ms. Budd left South Africa in 1984 and was hurriedly granted a
British passport so she could compete in the Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles.
   South Africa is barred from the Olympics and most international
competition because of its apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   In the 3,000-meter run, the barefoot Ms. Budd collided with U.S.
star Mary Decker Slaney, and the American was unable to continue.
Budd finished seventh amid a chorus of boos.
   She later set several world distance running records while
living and training in Britain. But she was constantly dogged by
anti-apartheid activists who said she should not be allowed to
compete due to her South African connections.
   Ms. Budd, 23, returned to South Africa in May 1988 suffering
from what doctors said was ``complete mental exhaustion.'' She says
she plans to forego international competition and live in her
homeland indefinitely.

<HEAD>Small Lines Vital to Rural America, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miles of track cast off by the big railroad
companies and now operated by smaller lines are vital to rural
America, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Martin Fitzpatrick, administrator of the department's Office of
Transportation, said the number and mileage of small railroads
began to increase in the 1970s but gained a full head of steam in
the mid-1980s.
   As for the future, he said that ``growth in the local and
regional railroad movement probably will be determined by the
outcome of court rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch
line sales and in transactions that create new railroads.''
   Since the Staggers Act of 1980, which eased the way for big rail
companies to sell off unprofitable branch lines, nearly 200 small
railroads have been formed, the report said. A fifth of these are
owned by shippers.
   ``Local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15
percent of the nation's rail system, or 30,000 miles, and employ
30,000 people,'' the report said. ``Last year, these carriers
generated $1.5 billion in revenues.''
   Small railroads are freight lines that earn less than $20
million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track.
   The report said that as much as 25,000 additional miles of rail
line are expected to be cast off by large railroads before they are
finished with restructuring plans. Eighteen thousand miles are to
be sold to small railroads over the next two years.
   ``These carriers will function primarily as feeder lines
originating in rural agricultural regions and funneling traffic
into the national rail network,'' the report said.

   Television coverage, radio equipment and
newspaper cameras were barred from former HUD Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr.'s confrontation with Congress on Tuesday _ a ban forced
by his lawyer against what he charged was the panel's ``circus-like
atmosphere.''
   ``We pulled the plug from their main act because, in fact, we
thought it would create a more somber forum,'' attorney Paul L.
Perito said.
   ``The circus-like atmosphere has been created by them, not by
us,'' Perito said before television cameras assembled outside the
congressional hearing where Pierce appeared under subpoena.
   With the cameras gone, Pierce invoked his constitutional right
against self-incrimination and refused to answer the subcommittee's
questions.
   Pierce's lawyer invoked a House rule that dates to the McCarthy
hearings of the 1950s. It allows witnesses subpoenaed to appear
before Congress to bar broadcast coverage and still photographs of
their appearance.
   Four television networks _ ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC _ failed in
their attempt to win a temporary injunction from a federal judge in
Washington on Monday to prevent Pierce from invoking the rule.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, which is probing
Pierce's tenure as secretary of housing and urban development, said
he favored repealing the rule and was reluctantly enforcing it.
   Lantos permitted full coverage of the subcommittee by radio,
television and photographers for an hour and 15 minutes while he
and other members discussed their investigation and Pierce's likely
refusal to testify.
   Pierce did not enter the committee room, however, until after
Lantos called a brief recess and ordered television, radio and
still photographic coverage to cease.
   Three television cameras remained in the room, apparently shut
off with their lenses pointing away from Pierce.
   Lantos then appealed to Pierce a final time to reconsider the
ban on coverage.
   ``On advice of my counsel, I ask that the rule be employed,''
Pierce said.
   Reporters remained in the room, however, and artists for the
television networks sketched the scene.
   Lantos permitted reporters to use tape recorders to record
Pierce's words.
   The subcommittee staff asked reporters who recorded the event to
sign a brief statement saying the audio recording ``will not be
broadcast in any manner.'' The document said reporters agreed
``under the penalty of perjury.''
   Pierce read a brief statement saying he would not answer
questions, then invoked his constitutional right each time as
Lantos posed eight questions.
   After Pierce left, camras and microphones were allowed to record
subcommittee members' criticism of the former HUD secretary.
   Pierce is under subpoena to appear again Oct. 27. Perito said he
would decide then whether he will seek to ban coverage again.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Nations officials and Namibia's
administrator reached agreement Tuesday on the laws governing the
territory's pre-independence elections in six weeks.
   The elections, set for Nov. 7-11, will pave the way for
independence in Namibia, which has been ruled by South Africa for
74 years.
   Namibia's South African administrator Louis Pienaar and the head
of the U.N. monitoring contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, finalized the
election laws Tuesday, but will not release the details until later
this week, Pienaar's spokesman Gerhard Roux said.
   Ten parties and coalitions have qualified to contest the
elections for a national assembly that will draw up Namibia's
constitution.
   The favorite in the polls is the South-West Africa People's
Organization, a leftist-oriented independence movement that waged a
23-year war against South African rule.
   Its main rival is expected to be the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, a moderate, multiracial coalition that favors a
free-market economy.
   South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia last year
under a regional peace accord that also calls for the phased
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   No date for Namibian independence has been set, but it is
expected to be early next year.

   Newlyweds frightened by Hurricane Hugo
into canceling honeymoon plans in Puerto Rico found a romantic
getaway in South Carolina, until they had to ride out the fierce
storm in a motel bathtub.
   ``I'll never forget it for the rest of my life. I just won't
forget,'' Christina Kimball said Tuesday. ``We got back on Sunday.
I was never so happy to see my house in my life.''
   The Kimballs had planned a Caribbean vacation, but warned by
reports of Hugo's destructive power, they canceled those plans.
Then they were offered the chance to use Mrs. Kimball's
mother-in-law's beachfront condominium.
   ``It seemed like the sensible thing to do,'' Mrs. Kimball said.
   The condominium was on the Isle of Palms off Charleston _ the
bulls-eye of Hugo's first strike on the U.S. mainland.
   ``We got there (and) we were thrilled. The condo was right on
the beach. It was beautiful,'' Mrs. Kimball said.
   ``The first night we were out there running around on the beach
all night. The next day we went shopping in town and spent oodles
of money. The next morning, at 6 o'clock, they were evacuating the
whole island.''
   Chased from the resort island, the couple took a motel room in
Charleston Thursday night.
   ``We were still trying to hang in there,'' Mrs. Kimbsion
``cooked the books.''
   Behind the scenes, the lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow
urged members to vote against the Nunn amendment. Picking up the
lobbyists tab of about $30,000 were residents and businesses near
Chanute Air Force Base, Ill.
   But Nunn warned against the provision, calling it a ``backdoor
way to block a process that has been under way for a year.'' Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, said the provision would undercut any future base
closings.
   ``If we set a precedent now that you can reopen the package, I'm
fearful future commissions won't be as effective,'' Warner said.
   Voting against the base closings amendment were Sens. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan
Dixon, D-Ill.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.;
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Spark Matsunaga,
D-Hawaii; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Paul Simon,
D-Ill.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.

<DATELINE>COLLINSVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The way of life in a city that
prospered centuries before Columbus is depicted in a new exhibit
that should correct the view of those whose only knowledge of
Indians comes from television Westerns, an organizer says.
   The Mississippian Indians who lived on what is now the Cahokia
Mounds State Historic Site between 900 and 1200 A.D. made a unique
attempt at urbanization, experts say. The site, with its
distinctive earthen mounds built for Indian ceremonies, is the
largest archaelogical site in the country.
   The $8.2 million visitors center that opened here last weekend
features a video program, reconstructed buildings and other
displays intended to show what life was like in the Indians' city,
which is believed to have had a population of 20,000.
   ``We're giving people an appreciation and insight into
prehistoric Indian culture,'' said Bill Iseminger, a staff member
at the new visitors center. ``We're trying to educate people about
Indian culture before the time of Columbus.''
   The Indians had a political and religious culture and a
well-defined social order of civil leaders, priests and nobles and
a working class, experts say.
   Visitors to the World Heritage Interpretive Center will get an
introduction to this culture with a widescreen video presentation
on the Indians' life, centered around thatched-roof huts and the
ceremonial mounds.
   ``Everybody thinks that Indians lived in tepees and rode horses.
And of course, these Indians didn't have those things,'' Iseminger
said.
   ``It's not the typical idyllic setting people usually associate
with Native Americans, because it had reached the urban stage,'' he
said, adding that this included some of the same problems plaguing
modern-day city dwellers, such as pollution and overcrowding.
   The exhibits will change about every three months. An outdoor
courtyard will be the site for classes and demonstrations of Indian
crafts and skills.
   The reconstituted village features several kinds of structures,
including a ceremonial sweat lodge and a grainery used for storage.
Huts have thatched roofs made of native prairie grass.
   ``We may even build a small mound,'' Iseminger said.
   Iseminger said the center should be an excellent educational
tool.
   ``We expect increased awareness and more people gaining
knowledge about Indian life in the prehistoric period,'' he said.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ NASA's Kennedy Space Center extended
for three years Tuesday a contract under which Lockheed Space
Operations Co. processes space shuttles for launch.
   The extension through Sept. 30, 1992, is valued at $1.6 billion.
   The original three-year contract was awarded Sept. 23, 1983, and
provided for four three-year options. Total contract value for the
original three years plus the first option is $4.37 billion.
   Under the contract, the Lockheed company, based in nearby
Titusville, is responsible for shuttle checkout, launch, landing
and recovery operations. It also handles maintenance and operation
of processing facilities and ground services at the space center.
   A small portion of the contract extension, totaling $5.6
million, is for maintenance of a deactivated, never-used shuttle
launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. The Air Force
will reimburse NASA for this amount.

   Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei appointed Seyyed Hassan Firuzabadi as army chief of staff
Tuesday, Tehran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as
announcing Firuzabadi's appointment in an edict. It did not give
Firuzabadi's age, rank, education or other background.
   The previous chief of staff was Brig. Gen. Esmael Sohrabi. No
reason was given for his replacement, nor did the radio say what
post he might have been moved to.
   The radio quoted the edict as saying Firuzabadi was appointed in
light of his ``revolutionary background, commitment,
resourcefulness in action and sincere endeavors in serving the
armed forces of the Islamic republic.''
   The new chief of staff will be responsible for the overall
direction of the armed forces, training, organization, equipment
and manpower, the television reported.
   It said he will also be responsible for coordination between the
army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards.
   The commander-in-chief of the armed forces is President Hashemi
Rafsanjani. He was appointed to that post late in the eight-year
Persian Gulf war by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and
charged with improving coordination between the regular armed
forces and the Revolutionary Guards.
   The guards corps was created soon after the 1979 revolution that
toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as a counterforce to the shah's
army.

   A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to dousing his

   Joseph Richmond, 41, of Akron pleaded guilty to felonious
assault, aggravated arson and child endangerment in the July 24
burning of Kimberly Richmond, said Gene Wise, spokesman for the
Summit County prosecutor's office.
   The daughter gave birth July 25 to a girl, delivered by
Caesarean section to prevent burn-related trauma, and had remained
hospitalized until last weekend with second- and third-degree burns
over 80 percent of her body.
   The father initially pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but
Common Pleas Judge Glen B. Morgan reviewed a psychiatric report and
ruled he was competent to stand trial.
   Richmond said after his arrest that he only wanted to scare his
daughter, police said.
   Morgan scheduled sentencing Oct. 24. Richmond remained free on
bond, a Summit County jail spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Traces of Plastic Explosive Reported Found in French Airliner Wreckage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts probing the explosion that destroyed a
French DC-10 over Niger and killed all 171 people aboard believe
they have found traces of the powerful explosive Semtex in the
wreckage, two French dailies said Tuesday.
   The newspapers Liberation and Le Parisien said the find
strengthened the connection between the UTA airline crash and the
Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   The UTA flight originated in Brazzaville, Congo, and blew up
over a desert less than an hour after it took off for Paris on
Sept. 19 following a stopover in N'Djamena, Chad.
   Both newspaper accounts cited unidentified sources involved in
the investigation and said laboratory tests in Paris still had to
confirm the presence of Semtex, a malleable, hard-to-detect
explosive made in Czechoslovakia.
   Liberation said the charge may have been concealed in a shipment
of farm chemicals loaded aboard the DC-10 in Brazzaville.
   French investigators said earlier it appears certain an
``explosive substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the
crash, but gave few details.
   It is believed that a radio-cassette player containing Semtex
was smuggled onto the Pan Am flight that exploded over Lockerbie,
killing 270 people _ all 259 aboard the plane and 11 on the ground.
   The major suspect in that bombing was the Syrian-backed Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group's
leader, Ahmed Jibril, denied involvement.
   Anonymous callers in Beirut and London claimed responsibility
for the UTA crash on behalf of the Moslem extremist group Islamic
Jihad and a previously unknown Chadian organization. Those claims
were not authenticated and French police appeared to be treating
them with skepticism.

<TEXT>
   Most students ended a two-week boycott of
Motley Elementary School on Tuesday after school officials and a
black parents group settled a dispute over naming the school for
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The West Lowndes Parents Association and the Lowndes County
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People agreed Monday to accept a compromise reached during an
eight-hour negotiation Sunday with members of the county school
board.
   The compromise came after two days of meetings that mediator Wil
Colom, a Columbus attorney, said showed ``real leadership in
solving an emotional dispute.''
   Under the compromise, the school will be known officially as
West Lowndes Elementary, but the building itself will be named
after King.
   ``This retains the board's position on naming a school after the
area in which it is located,'' the compromise said.
   ``Other buildings at any school site can also be named for
individuals who are deceased and whose names will not inflame the
community,'' it added.
   The old school name of Motley reflected the name of the local
unincorporated community, but blacks protested that the community
was named for the family that owned a plantation in the area in
slave-holding times.
   Tuesday's attendance at the elementary school was 350 out of 425
pupils expected, officials said.
   Only 32 students attended Sept. 12, the first day of school,
because of dissatisfaction over the school's name and its
incomplete construction. There were 212 students at the school
Monday, officials reported.
   The compromise also says that when the board selects a new
assistant superintendent of education, primary consideration will
be given to a candidate's ability to communicate with and work with
minority students, parents and staff.
   The West Lowndes Parents Association and the NAACP had wanted a
black assistant superintendent.
   The deal still needs federal court approval under a 1970 court
desegregation order.
   School board approval came in a 45-minute closed session Monday.
Board President Gary Chism wouldn't give the vote tally or answer
any questions.

<HEAD>Health Secretary Calls For Renewed Commitment to Improving Blacks'
Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said Tuesday
the country must ``renew our commitment'' to improving the health
of black Americans, who are dying younger than white Americans.
   Sullivan cited a new government report showing life expectancy
for blacks is several years shorter than for whites and that blacks
have higher death rates than whites for infant mortality and for
several diseases, including AIDS.
   ``Even as the lines on almost every disease chart move toward
improvement, there is a continuing disparity in the burden of death
and illness experienced by blacks and other minority Americans as
compared with the improving health of Americans as a whole,''
Sullivan said.
   ``We must renew our commitment to close these health
disparities,'' he said.
   The report of mortality statistics for 1987 by the National
Center for Health Statistics shows that life expectancy at birth
rose slightly from 1986 to reach a record high of 75 years in 1987.
Life expectancy for white Americans was 75.6 years, but for blacks
it was 69.4 years, the same as the previous year, according to the
report.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was the 10th leading cause
of death for blacks, while it ranked 15th for the U.S. population
overall in 1987.
   Of the more than 13,000 AIDS deaths, 65 percent were white
males, 25 percent were black males and the remaining 10 percent
were split evenly between white females and black females.
   Blacks also died at disproportionately higher rates from other
illnesses, including kidney disease, for which the black death rate
was 2.8 times the rate of the white population, and diabetes, for
which the black death rate was 2.3 times that for whites, according
to the report.
   The rate of infant mortality declined slightly in 1987 to 10.1
infant deaths per 1,000 live births, from 10.4 the previous year.
The rate for whites dropped from 8.9 to 8.6, while the rate for
blacks declined from 18 to 17.9.
   The report also shows the drug-related death rate for blacks was
more than twice the rate for whites, and the homicide death rate
for blacks was six times that of whites.

<HEAD>Study Finds Payoffs for Women Who Return to School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who return to college and earn degrees
report increased self-esteem and more satisfying jobs, according to
a national study released Tuesday.
   The survey of nearly 3,400 selected graduates from 33 women's
colleges also found that 56 percent continued their formal
education beyond an undergraduate degree.
   The study, conducted by the Women's College Coalition, a project
of the Association of American Colleges, found that the typical
graduate among those studied returned to school in her mid-30s and
was married with school-age children. Of those who were married, 55
percent had been aged 18 to 21, the traditional college years, when
they wed.
   The survey, conducted last year, included women who entered
college after age 23 and graduated in the years 1970 to 1988.
   Eighty-eight percent of the women reported that their jobs
changed in positive ways after they graduated; 87 percent said
their education had contributed to an appreciation of their
abilities.
   ``Achieving that degree had a major impact on their
self-confidence, their sense of self-esteem and personal
fulfillment and their sense of being an independent person,'' said
Dr. Sally Wall of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in
Baltimore, the principal researcher on the study.
   Fifty-seven percent of the respondents said their main reason
for returning to school was for personal fulfillment; 33 percent
cited career reasons.
   Some 50 percent of the graduates were aged 31 to 44; the oldest
was 85. The women typically were first-generation college
graduates, had previously earned less than one year of college
credit and completed their degrees in four years.

<HEAD>Bush Hopes School Summit Will Produce Dramatic Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday he hopes his
two-day education summit with the nation's governors this week will
produce ways to ``dramatically change things'' in America's
troubled schools.
   ``We've got to see what it is we're doing wrong, how can we be
more accountable,'' Bush told reporters after hearing business
leaders complain about the problems that poorly educated students
cause in the workplace.
   Bush will travel by helicopter to Charlottesville, Va., on
Wednesday afternoon for an education summit with the governors on
the University of Virginia campus.
   It will be only the third such presidential convocation of
governors in history, and the first since President Franklin D.
Roosevelt summoned governors more than half a century ago for their
advice on coping with the Great Depression.
   Even before the governors gathered at Thomas Jefferson's
``academical village,'' educators and politicians were expressing
hope that the summit would give new impetus to a school reform
movement that has shown signs of floundering.
   White House officials and leaders of the National Governors'
Association have said the meeting's top priority will be to lay the
groundwork for the first set of national performance goals for the
schools.
   Bush, who promised in last year's election campaign to become
``the education president,'' said, ``I think we're going to come
together with the governors on major objectives for this country in
terms of education, something that's never been done before.''
   He said he has his ideas for changes but was keeping them
private. ``I'm going down there to listen and work with the
governors, not try to impose an agenda from here,'' he said.
   ``I want to see us come up with some suggestions that will
dramatically change things,'' Bush said. ``I was just reminded by a
group of business leaders that, on a per capita basis, we spent far
more than Germany, far more than Japan, and yet we're not achieving
the way they are.
   ``We've got to see what it is we're doing wrong, how can we be
more accountable,'' he said. ``It's in those areas of goals,
national goals, but coming up through the governors, that I think
we can make a real contribution.''
   John F. Akers, chairman of International Business Machines Corp.
who led a Business Roundtable delegation of corporate executives
who met with Bush, scoffed at the notion that America's $353
billion education system suffers from a lack of money.
   ``There's twice as much money per student than is available in
Japan and the Japanese are beating our brains out,'' Akers said.
   ``It's not a money problem,'' he said. ``It's a management and
an execution problem.''
   The Business Roundtable executives, including the chairmen of
Xerox, Du Pont, Bell South, K Mart, Procter &amp; Gamble, Alcoa and
Union Carbide, pledged that they and other leaders of the 200 major
companies would get personally involved with school improvement
efforts in their home states.
   ``We're not getting (enough) educated people to fill the jobs
... of importance to American industry,'' Akers said.
   David Kearns, the Xerox chairman, said, ``We don't yet have any
momentum in the country for real, structural change'' in the
schools.
   He said the summit could ``draw the governors and the
administration into a coalition to really drive this.''
   Kearns said that among needed changes are increased authority
for teachers and principals to ``run the schools the way they need
to, not the educational bureaucracy.''
   Also, he said, ``we need Head Start for everybody.'' The $1.1
billion preschool development program for poor children now reaches
fewer than 20 percent of those eligible.
   While Bush supports Head Start, he has sought to dampen
educators' hopes that any major new commitment of federal funds
will flow from the education summit.
   ``We would not expect to come out with any new funding
proposals,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Bush will open the summit Wednesday with a welcome address to
the governors, then begin the first three of six closed working
sessions.
   The topics will include revitalizing the teaching profession,
improving the learning environment _ including keeping drugs out of
schools _ and governance, or determining who is in charge of the
schools.
   After a state dinner Wednesday night in a tent outside
Monticello, Jefferson's home near the university, Bush and the
governors will reassemble Thursday morning for the final three
working sessions on choice and restructuring, a competitive work
force and postsecondary education.
   Those sessions _ attended by subgroups of the governors and
Bush's Cabinet _ will be followed by a plenary session, a luncheon
convocation and a finale at which Republican and Democratic
governors will join Bush in delivering closing statements.
   After his return to Washington, Bush will speak about the summit
at a White House ceremony honoring outstanding secondary schools.
   Minnesota's Democratic governor, Rudy Perpich, sent word he will
miss the summit. A leading advocate of Bush's proposal to give
parents more choice over which schools their children attend,
Perpich sent word he is staying at home to work for passage of a
tax bill at a special session of the state Legislature.
   Theodore Roosevelt convened the first governors' summit in 1908
to discuss the urgency of preserving the country's natural
resources. A governors' conference held in 1933 by his distant
cousin, Franklin Roosevelt, was overshadowed by the president's
decision to close the banks on the morning of the summit.

<HEAD>Rain Scattered Along East Coast After Heavy Rain In Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was scattered along the East Coast on Tuesday, after a
night of heavy rain in the Southeast.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered during the afternoon
from the Florida Peninsula across coastal North Carolina to New
England.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
1.57 inches at Chatham, Mass. Other amounts during that period were
less than an inch.
   Late Monday and early Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms brought
rain to much of the Southeast, much of the middle Atlantic Coast
region and New England.
   During the 24-hour period up to 8 a.m. EDT Tuesday, one-inch
rainfall totals were common from Florida and Alabama to the middle
Atlantic Coast.
   Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport got 4.87 inches of rain Monday, the
sixth highest total on record there for any one day, and some
highway flooding was reported, the National Weather Service said.
   In coastal North Carolina, along the Outer Banks, rain has
fallen at Cape Hatteras each of the last 14 days, with a total of
15.51 inches in that period. So far this month, Cape Hatteras has
received 19.73 inches of rain.
   In the West, showers were widely scattered across western Oregon
and northern California, with a few showers over the central Rocky
Mountains.
   Late Monday and early Tuesday, scattered showers brought light
rain to parts of the Great Basin, covering Nevada and western Utah,
and the Pacific Northwest. Rainfall totals were generally less than
a tenth of an inch for the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. EDT.
   Dense fog was reported along the northern coast of California
early in the day.
   In the Southeast, Miami had a record high of 93 degrees.
   But Tuesday afternoon temperatures were only in the 50s from
eastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota through Michigan
to northern New England, with readings in the 40s in Upper Michigan
and northern Lower Michigan.
   Overnight into Wednesday, frost and freeze advisories were
issued for all of Michigan, and a frost advisory was issued for
northern and central Indiana.
   Late Monday and early Tuesday, freezing temperatures were
reported in Minnesota, North Dakota, eastern South Dakota, northern
Iowa and northwestern Wisconsin, with readings only in the mid to
upper 20s across northern Minnesota and northeastern North Dakota.
   Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was 25 degrees at
International Falls, Minn., on the Canadian border.

<HEAD>Former Welding Inspector at Nuclear Reservation Pleads Innocent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former welding inspector on the Hanford
nuclear reservation pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges he lied
about his certification for the job.
   ``He completely and emphatically denies his guilt,'' said
Chelsea Korte, lawyer for Bruce Ronald Degnan. ``He really is
befuddled.''
   Degnan is charged with 18 counts of falsifying certification for
himself and 10 of employees from 1984 to 1987 while working as a
federal contractor at the plutonium production complex.
   At the time, Hanford was involved in producing plutonium for
hydrogen bombs. Most of the plutonium production facilities are now
closed.
   Working as Tri Testing Inc., Degnan and his staff inspected
welds at Hanford, but officials won't disclose whether Degnan's
company inspected welds in sensitive production plants.
   Degnan contends he is the victim of a government blunder.
   Degnan, 46, was released on his own recognizance after
arraignment.
   If convicted, Degnan faces a maximum of five years in prison on
each count. Westinghouse Hanford Co. operates the reservation for
the Department of Energy. The company took over in June 1987 and
stopped giving Degnan's firm work later that year.

   Soviet and Israeli representatives on Tuesday
approved an agreement for a mutual exchange of chambers of
commerce, Israel radio reported.
   The radio said the agreement was approved at a meeting between
Israeli and Soviet trade delegations in Paris, which was sponsored
by the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce.
   The agreement was approved and signed by the deputy president of
the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vladimir Galanov, and
head of Israel's Chamber of Commerce, Dani Gilerman.
   The final agreement is to be signed in Israel and the Soviet
Union in November, the radio reported.
   It said the delegations would continue their talks, aimed at
developing commercial ties between the two countries, on Wednesday.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967
to protest Israel's seizure of lands from Moscow's Arab allies in
the Middle East war.
   The two countries exchanged interest offices in 1986 and 1987
and have since been developing cultural and tourist ties. But they
deeply differ in their views on how to achieve peace in the Middle
East, and the Soviet side says this prevents further normalization
of relations.

<TEXT>
   Youngsters who enjoy reading are viewed by their
peers as more likely to do well in school rather than as nerdy
bookworms, a survey of children showed Wednesday.
   In addition, half the children surveyed, ages 6 to 10, said they
``really like to read'' and 42 percent ``sort of'' like to read,
said the study conducted for the American Library Association. Only
7.2 percent said they did not like to read.
   The survey was conducted among 500 children at 10 suburban malls
around the country in an approach that does not produce a
representative sample, a news release said.
   According to the study, 62.4 percent of the children said a kid
who reads a lot ``learns things in school more quickly,'' while
18.8 percent said such kids were called ``nerds or geeks.'' In
fact, 18 percent said children who did not enjoy reading were
likely to be called such names.
   Reading came in fifth of 12 activities when children were asked
their favorite things to do, finishing behind playing with friends,
outdoor sports, bicycling and watching television.
   Among the activities reading beat out in the popularity contest:
video games and listening to music.
   The study also indicated that of reading, writing and
arithmetic, math was the favorite subject of 48.2 percent, with
reading pulling in 35.4 percent and writing 16 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Meredith, the black man who cracked the
color barrier at the University of Mississippi 27 years ago, has
been hired to what some see as an unlikely post: adviser to
conservative Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Meredith said in an interview Tuesday that he had been hired
officially on Sept. 5 to advise the senator on questions of race,
education, drugs and urban problems, after providing informal
advice for the last year.
   Meredith, 58, has changed his views markedly since becoming the
first black enrolled at Ole Miss in 1962. Since then, he has called
integration the ``biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.''
   ``My understanding of the senator's position ... is that every
citizen has the entitlement to every right,'' he said Tuesday. ``So
there's no need for any specific rights. And I agree with that.
   ``It is the specific intent of the liberal elite to establish on
a permanent basis a dual citizenship in the United States. They
need to keep blacks in a non full-citizenship status. It's not
Senator Helms who doesn't want blacks to be free in America. It's
the liberal agenda.''
   In a letter to acquaintances, he wrote that Helms, who is up for
re-election next year, ``wants to provide the best possible
representation to them as well as the entire black population.''
   Some civil rights leader were nonetheless astonished at
Meredith's decision to join Helms' staff.
   ``It's somewhat of a shock to me,'' said Benjamin Hooks of the
NAACP. ``I've watched (Meredith's) progression _ or maybe I should
say retrogression _ from being a militant civil rights advocate to
another stand altogether. But I didn't know he had changed to the
point he would fit in with Sen. Helms' staff.''
   ``Without question, Senator Helms has one of the worst civil
rights voting records in the Congress,'' said Ralph Neas of the
Washington-based Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. ``For years
he has led the right-wing opposition to effective civil rights laws
and remedies. He is a senator markedly out of step with the
bipartisan consensus on civil rights in this country.''
   While Meredith was battling segregation in the South during the
'60s, the conservative Helms was gaining a following as a Raleigh
television editorialist who harshly criticized the movement to
bring about racial change.
   Since his election to the Senate in 1972, Helms has vigorously
opposed civil rights bills and other domestic programs favored by
many blacks. He has defended the white minority government of South
Africa, fought making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national
holiday and criticized such national black leaders as Jesse Jackson.
   Meredith entered the all-white University of Mississippi after
spending nine years in the Air Force. His arrival on campus caused
rioting; two people died, and President Kennedy sent in troops and
federal marshals.
   Since then, Meredith, who was wounded during a freedom march in
Mississippi in 1965, has held numerous jobs in various parts of the
country, most recently living in Cincinnati, where he worked as a
financial planner and tree farmer.

   The Soviet Union, while accepting a U.S.
call to slash chemical weapons stockpiles, insisted Tuesday on a
different approach keyed to halting production of the deadly arms.
   A cessation of further output of poison gas must be ``part of
the parcel,'' senior Soviet negotiator Viktor P. Karpov said.
   Even so, the White House welcomed Soviet acceptance of President
Bush's initiative.
   At the White House, Bush said, ``I am very pleased with the way
things are going. ... We've got some good common ground that I
don't think we had before.''
   And Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the Soviet
response ``shows that we are on the same wavelength. It was a very
constructive response. Our ultimate objective is total elimination
of chemical weapons. And it appears that both nations are now ready
to act.''
   The Soviet position was outlined by Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly and then by
Karpov at a news conference.
   The two sides disagreed on whether the Soviet plan went beyond
Bush's initiative. But the two approaches clearly differed in two
significant ways.
   Bush would have the superpowers retain 2 percent of their
chemical weapons until all nations ``capable of building chemical
weapons'' sign an international ban.
   And, as the president explained his proposal Monday in a speech
to the General Assembly, the United States would keep producing
new, binary weapons while destroying older stocks.
   Binary weapons are deadly, but only when they are mixed.
   Shevardnadze praised Bush's move and said, ``The Soviet Union,
together with the United States, is ready to go further.''
   He called for a cessation of production. At a news conference
later, Deputy Foreign Minister Karpov said Soviet acceptance was
conditional on a halt to U.S. production of binary weapons.
   ``It is part of the parcel,'' said Karpov, the highest-ranked
arms control expert in the Soviet hierarchy. ``It will not be
sufficient to get rid of old weapons if the United States is going
to produce new ones.''
   A second key difference between the two sides centers on when
all U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons would be destroyed.
   Bush said the United States was ready to destroy 98 percent of
its weapons in the first eight years of an agreement with Moscow.
The remaining 2 percent would be retained until 40 nations now
negotiating in Geneva agreed on a treaty to ban chemical weapons _
and all nations with the capability to produce them signed the pact.
   This would mean an outright ban depended on the approval of such
nations as Iran and Iraq, and possibly Libya, which the Reagan
administration says is on the verge of production. Iraq and Iran
have been accused of using poison gas in their Persian Gulf War
that ended last year.
   Karpov said the Soviets were willing to destroy all their
chemical weapons once the treaty was completed.
   ``We wouldn't bar the treaty entering into force if there is one
nation capable of producing chemical weapons,'' he said.
   Karpov said the Soviets were not helping any country to
manufacture chemical weapons. He placed the Soviet arsenal at
50,000 tons.
   Bush administration officials have declined to divulge the U.S.
total. The general assumption is that it is about 30,000 tons.
   Shevardnadze also called on the two superpowers to ``renounce
the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances.''
   And, the Soviet foreign minister said, they should employ
``rigorous verification of the cessation of production of chemical
warfare agents.'
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed
last week in talks in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on a two-step plan for
exchanging information about chemical weapons and for trial
inspections of stockpiles.
   Baker had a seven-minute meeting with Shevardnadze after the
foreign minister delivered his speech.
   He told reporters he had to study the Soviet chemical weapons
proposal and that it did not appear to go beyond Bush's initiative.
   But Karpov said ``our proposal is a wider one.''
   He said Moscow was ready to begin negotiations with the United
States to reduce stockpiles on both sides.
   Shevardnadze, in his speech, welcomed Bush's initiative and said
``we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons.''

<HEAD>NASA Chief Says Budget Cuts Won't Help Mars Mission Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly resisted a
House subcommittee's efforts Tuesday to get him to estimate how
much it will cost to go to Mars, but complained that congressional
cuts in the agency's 1990 budget won't help.
   Noting that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
budget is no more than 1 percent of total federal spending, Truly
told the panel that ratio will have to increase if the nation is
serious about moving out to the moon again, and beyond to Mars.
   Already, he said, House and Senate appropriations committee
moves to slash NASA's $2.05 billion budget request by as much as
$400 million is forcing the agency to consider slowing its
construction schedule for the spacestation that is planned as a
forerunner to moon and Mars missions.
   However, Truly stoutly denied news reports that the pending
budget cuts are forcing the agency to redesign the station.
   ``We're not redesigning the station,'' he said. ``It's more a
matter of ... pacing the construction of the station.''
   Truly, the first former astronaut to head the space agency,
acknowledged that President Bush's goal for a manned mission to
Mars will take a commitment by a succession of administrations over
three or four decades and will be costly.
   However, he declined to give even a rough guess of how much NASA
budgets would have to grow to reach the goal. ``We are not far
enough to have a program plan,'' he said to several subcommittee
members who pressed him for an estimate.
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the Science, Space and
Technology space science subcommittee, predicted the NASA budget
would have to swell to at least $15 billion a year, and perhaps $30
billion.
   While supporting the goal of sending a manned mission to Mars,
Nelson told Truly it would be better to bypass the moon lest that
program eat up too much money.
   He did not press Truly on that point, however, saying,
``there'll be plenty of time to debate that over the next three
years'' before a final decision is made.

   The Soviet legislature on Tuesday tackled the
problem of public anger over private businesses that earn fat
profits by providing scarce goods and services.
   Cooperative businesses are one of the few successes of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform program. They have grown
dramatically since they were legalized 2{ years ago and now provide
$20 billion worth of goods and services, Deputy Premier Leonid I.
Abalkin said Tuesday.
   But decades of propaganda instilled into many Soviets a strong
feeling that earning a profit is evil.
   Deputy Veniamin Yarin of Nizhni Tagilsk pointed up the mood of
much of the public when he said cooperatives engage in ``open
robbery of the working man.''
   The cooperatives' exemption from state-controlled prices and the
high wages paid to their employees reinforce public resentment.
Some cooperatives are victims of extortion by organized crime.
Others are fronts for thieves.
   Even Gorbachev asked the legislature how the cooperatives manage
to find soap when no one else can. And he noted that the
cooperative price might be 5 rubles (about $7.75) for a bar of
soap, when a state store would charge 40 kopecks (62 cents) to 1
ruble ($1.55).
   ``We have to take into account the mood of the people,'' he
said, as the legislators began debating proposed amendments that
would give local governments more power to regulate cooperatives.
   Gorbachev stood by his creations, however.
   ``The main thing for us is to preserve cooperatives,'' he said.
``People see the evident difference between them. Those providing
services, manufacturing, producing construction materials,
repairing, helping, are more than welcome by the people. All those
intermediary cooperatives are considered to be thieves. What is the
way out of this situation?
   ``If we do not set this matter in order, we will doom the
cooperative movement.''
   One deputy even proposed closing down all wholesale and retail
cooperatives, but this was defeated, the Soviet news agency Tass
said.
   ``We educate people to be engineers and they sit in public
restrooms and collect 20 kopecks (31 cents) for each visitor who
comes to execute his natural functions,'' said Deputy Leonid Sukhov.
   He was referring to both the high prices charged by cooperatives
and the high wages paid to their employees, which entice talented
people into leaving jobs in state enterprises.
   Gorbachev told the deputies he was faced with an ``ultimatum''
on cooperatives when he met last week with workers and collective
farmers who are members of the Communist Party's central bodies.
   But Deputy Anatoly Sobchak, head of the legal faculty at
Leningrad State University, said cooperatives in some areas were
facing wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring
the law.
   Abalkin, one of Gorbachev's closest economic advisers, told the
deputies that ``cooperatives are making the first step toward
forming a socialist market, which we have been talking about for so
long.''
   He argued problems that cause public outrage over cooperatives
actually are the problems of the entire Soviet economy, such as
severe shortages of basic goods and services.
   Abalkin said Soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are
an important part of the economy, agree to treat them equally with
state business, and allow local governments to regulate them in
order to take into account local needs and viewpoints.
   Tass said these amendments and another regulating wages paid by
cooperatives were sent to a legislative committee for refinement.
   The 542-member, two-chamber Supreme Soviet, presided over by
Gorbachev, has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and
discontent caused by the demands of ethnic groups and by the state
economy's failure to meet many basic needs.
   The legislature also created a commission to review press
coverage of Deputy Boris Yeltsin's tour of the United States.
Pravda stirred up a storm when it reprinted an Italian newspaper's
article charging Yeltsin with drinking and shopping his way across
America. Pravda later apologized, but some deputies have called for
the resignation of Pravda editor Viktor G. Afanasiev.

   The government of Venezuela has retreated from
its demand for a 50 percent reduction in its $21 billion debt,
hoping to rejuvenate stalled negotiations with commercial banks,
officials said Tuesday.
   Instead, Venezuela will offer banks ``a broad menu of options''
that will include lesser discounts in exchange for weaker
guarantees of remaining debt, said Venezuelan planning minister
Miguel Rodriguez Fandeo, who is in charge of his country's
debt-reduction effort.
   He also announced that a consortium of 15 banks has agreed to a
$600 million short-term loan to allow Venezuela to catch up with
missed interest payments by Dec. 31. The government is contributing
$400 million from its reserves to wiping out the missed payments,
he said.
   Briefing reporters at the annual meeting of the 152-nation
International Monetary Fund and its sister organization, the World
Bank, Rodriguez insisted that the new strategy did not mean
Venezuela had retreated from its goal of ``the largest possible
reduction in debt and debt service.''
   Debt reduction is the keystone of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady's initiative, announced in March, a month after bloody riots
in Venezuela focused attention on the plight of developing
countries mired by a crushing $1.3 trillion debt burden.
   Because of the riots, Venezuela was one of the first countries
singled out for debt reduction by the Bush administration, but
commercial banks have concluded pacts with Mexico and the
Philippines first. Bankers have accused Venezuela of being
intransigent in its demands.
   Brady, in an afternoon speech to World Bank and IMF delegates,
admonished both developing countries and their creditors toward
flexibility, citing discussions between banks and Costa Rica,
Venezuela, Morocco, Uruguay and Chile.
   ``An important challenge at the moment appears to be the problem
of unrealistic expectations _ both among debtor countries and the
banks,'' Brady said. ``In one sense, improving expectations was
essential to restoring forward momentum in the debt strategy. ...
In another sense, however, we must recognize that rising
expectations need to be tempered by realism.''
   ``Excessive expectations can only promote delays, increase the
risk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economic
costs to the banks and debtor countries,'' Brady said.
   Rodriguez said his country will continue to offer to buy back
its loans in cash in exchange for a 60 percent discount and issue
guaranteed bonds for a 50 percent debt reduction.
   However, it will also be willing to accept a lower discount if
banks accept bonds with weaker guarantees than the 50 percent bonds.
   In addition, Venezuela will accept new loans from the banks, but
only to the extent necessary to compensate for debt reduction less
than 50 percent, the planning minister said.
   He said his country is shifting its policy in hope of
accommodating banks which, because of tax and other regulations,
are unable to take a 50 percent loss on the loans. Rodriguez said
the new strategy should allow a greater number of banks to
participate in a debt-reduction pact, which he said Venezuela would
like to conclude by the end of the year.
   The $600 million short-term loan was offered by 15 banks, led by
Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and Lloyd's
Bank, said Pedro Tinoco Jr., president of Venezuela's central bank.

   The West German finance minister met with
President Bush on Tuesday to discuss ways to help Poland's new
non-communist government redirect its economy and reduce its $42
billion debt.
   Meanwhile, Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz brought
his pleas for aid to the 152 governments in the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund meeting here. Poland has been a major
topic of discussion at the meeting.
   And eight Senate Democrats, including the chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, proposed forgiving Poland's $2 billion
agricultural debt to the United States and providing food aid
beyond the $100 million in assistance proposed by Bush.
   As outlined in a letter to the president, the proposal calls for
the donation of $150 million in corn, grain, sorghum, wheat, butter
and pork products to Poland and urges authorization of an
additional $150 million in assistance.
   It also calls for the extension of preferential tariff treatment
for Poland and the extension of technical aid through the
Agriculture Department.
   The legislators, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
Agriculture Committee chairman, also challenged U.S. private
industry to make available $10 million to Poland in money and
equipment.
   ``The president's plan is a welcome but stop-gap effort that
fails to give Poland the long-term help it needs to restructure its
agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest democracy,''
Leahy said.
   The letter was signed by Leahy and Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.;
Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Bennett
Johnston, D-La.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Richard Bryan,
D-Nevada, and Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   Speaking with reporters after his half-hour meeting with Bush,
West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the two had discussed
ways to reduce the Polish debt. Waigel said he told Bush the World
Bank and IMF should help.
   Poland owes about $10 billion to commercial banks and the rest
to other governments, including the United States.
   The World Bank's International Finance Corp. offered earlier
this week to help Poland privatize its state-owned industry and set
up new banks and markets.
   There is general agreement that the IMF will have to assess
Poland's situation before there can be any large-scale
international help.
   Officials of Solidarity, the main force behind the new
government, have said Poland needs at least $10 billion over three
years.
   Waigel also said he told Bush that there should be a
strengthening of market forces in Poland and that the European
Economic Community should help.
   West Germany is discussing giving Poland credits and credit
guarantees to supply projects that would stimulate the economy,
Waigel said.

<HEAD>Two B-2 Tests Cut Short</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two B-2 stealth bomber test flights were cut
short last week, once because of a renewed oil-pressure problem and
once because of high winds, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   A planned 5{-hour flight Sept. 21 was scrubbed after three hours
after indications of low oil pressure in the plane's No. 1 airframe
accessory drive, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   The bat-wing bomber is designed to pass through enemy radar
virtually undetected. The accessory drive is the gear box that
powers the jet's generators and controls.
   The same problem had forced the crew to scub the second test
flight of the $530 million plane on Aug. 16.
   ``As with the second flight, the B-2 was landed early as a
precaution,'' Williams said. ``The flight crew was in no danger.''
   Four new casings were installed for the stealth's fifth test
flight Saturday, and no oil-pressure problems were encountered,
Williams said.
   However, that flight ended after 77 minutes ``because of gusty
winds at the altitude at which the plane was flying,'' William
said, adding that he could not say what the wind strengths were.
   It was decided to cut that flight short as a precaution because
of the stress being placed on the bomber during the particular
maneuvers being conducted, Williams said.
   ``That doesn't mean that the plane can't fly at high winds,'' he
said.
   The crew did complete an air-refueling test under which the
bat-wing jet purposely stopped just short of its refueling KC-10
aircraft.
   Williams said the stealth won't be flown again for at least five
weeks while ``planned modifications'' and ground vibration tests
are done.
   The plane has flown a total of 12 hours, Williams said.
   ``The Air Force says (the stealth) has performed better than
expected in areas of handling qualities, especially smooth aircraft
control in the fueling position,'' he said.
   When questioned, Williams said the Air Force hadn't said in
which areas the plane hasn't performed up to expectations.
   The government has spent about $22.4 billion in the B-2 program,
which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has balked at
paying more than $500 million each for 132 bombers.
   Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, manufacturer Northrop Corp.
and the Pentagon have begun an an intensive campaign to counter
those who question the plane's capabilities.
   The Pentagon wants $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming
fiscal year, and may need $8 billion in each of the three years of
peak production, 1992-'94.

   The House began debate Tuesday on a huge
budget bill weighed down by such unconnected issues as catastrophic
illness insurance, child care, pornographic telephone services and
the fight over President Bush's capital gains tax cut.
   ``It's so full of irrelevancies, it is hardly recognizable'' as
a budget bill, said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn. ``Let the games
begin,'' he added, as debate began.
   In an unusual procedure, the House opened debate on the bill
before agreeing to a schedule for the amendments. The budget
portion is designed to reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by
$16.6 billion.
   During the day, Democratic leaders scrambled to find more votes
for their amendment which would derail the capital gains tax cut.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said reaction to the Democratic
alternative, which would raise tax rates for the wealthy to restore
deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts, was ``encouraging.''
   From the White House, however, Bush sent letters to all House
members calling his tax cut ``the right policy for all Americans''
and saying he would veto the Democratic alternative should it be
approved.
   A vote on that provision, originally slated for Wednesday, was
delayed at least until Thursday while the behind-the-scenes
political wrangling continued.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., who opposes the Bush-backed plan to
drop the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent
for the next 27 months, conceded the Democrats didn't have the
votes.
   ``But the other side hasn't got the votes yet either,'' he said.
   While capital gains has been the most partisan fight, other
issues have broad public impact, including at least three competing
child care amendments.
   The House is retreating from past actions with an amendment
expected next week to repeal the new Medicare catastrophic health
insurance program. Elderly groups have protested the new taxes
levied on the elderly to pay for their additional coverage.
   Business groups have lobbied successfully for a repeal of rules
mandating non-discrimination in their health plans.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the House was ``signaling our willingness to
bow to any special interest group that is aggressive and
single-minded enough to hound us into submission.''
   ``But my disappointment with this bill ... is minor when
compared to my disappointment with the president,'' Rostenkowski
said. ``The president has squandered the first year of his
presidency on symbolic victories.''
   ``What will he have to show for it at the end of this year?''
Rostenkowski said. ``Legislation to protect the flag from a handful
of misguided exhibitionists, a blueprint for a drug war that is
doomed for failure because he refuses to pay for it, a plan to sail
to Mars, and if he gets his way, and a tax cut for the wealthiest 5
percent of our population in a year when our deficit exceeds $130
billion.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Budget
Committee, called on lawmakers to stick with the bill even if they
don't like some of the provisions or amendments.
   If the bill is not ``enacted in some form,'' he reminded the
House, the Gramm-Rudman law will require more than $16 billion in
automatic spending cuts in both domestic and military programs. The
law mandates those cuts if Congress and the president fail to
reduce the deficit to within $10 billion of the $100 billion target
for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   The deficit reduction is supposed to be in place by Oct. 15, but
Foley said Tuesday he didn't expect that do be done. The result
will be what he said will be ``a sort of technical'' cutback, but
he expected the House, Senate and administration to work out their
differences to avoid any permanent reductions.

<HEAD>Bus Operators Say Service Could Be Cut Because Of Law For Disabled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators of private bus companies complained
Tuesday before a House subcommittee that the proposed Americans
With Disabilities Act could force them to cut service, especially
to the poor and rural dwellers.
   Most of the testimony centered on the requirements under the
proposed legislation that inter-city bus fleets be made accessible
to the disabled within six or seven years of enactment.
   The bus operators interpret that requirement as a mandate that
all buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts, which they say cost
from $10,000 to $35,000 per bus to install, not to mention
maintenance costs.
   ``The mandatory lift requirement, with its attendant costs,
including installation, seat loss, and possible package express
loss, would spell the end of intercity bus service in the United
States,'' said Frank M. Henry, chairman of the American Bus
Association.
   The operators are proposing alternatives, such as a system of
leasing equipped buses or having a limited number in the fleet,
making those buses available on call.
   Advocates for the disabled say they have the same right to
spontaneous travel that others have, and a reservations system or
other limited availability would prevent that.
   With 200,000 buses in the total fleet operated by members of the
American Bus Association, the cost of installing lifts would would
range from $20 million to $70 million, said Henry, of Wilkes-Barre,
Pa.
   He told the surface transportation subcommittee of the Committee
on Public Works and Transportation that by contrast, the industry
had operating income of $41.5 million from 1982-1986.
   The bus operators say the installation of wheelchair lifts would
result in the loss of up to four revenue-producing seats, not to
mention cargo and luggage space and modifying restrooms.
   Owners also testified that where wheelchair access was in place,
demand was minimal.
   Advocates for the disabled told the subcommittee, however, that
the bill does not specify wheelchair lifts, but added that the lift
technology is so advanced that the cost estimates given by the
industry are exaggerated.
   Most of the testimony Tuesday and in a hearing by the
subcommittee last week dealt with the costs of lifts.
   A German-designed lift used on Denver buses costs $11,000,
removes only one seat and occupies no baggage space, said Marilyn
Golden of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.
   She also said there is no requirement to modify restrooms,
adding that the disabled have had long experience coping without
bathrooms.
   She and several other witnesses disputed the claims of low
ridership, saying the disabled have been conditioned not be be able
to expect to travel.
   ``It takes time for them to believe the word `Yes','' said John
Winski, assistant director of the Massachusetts Coalition of
Citizens with Disabilities.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Tuesday accepted President Bush's call for deep
U.S.-Soviet chemical arms cuts and challenged the United States to
go further and faster.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will ``radically reduce or
completely destroy'' its chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and
stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium _ all if Washington
reciprocates.
   Shevardnadze, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, said the
two governments have narrowed their differences and he predicted
that by the U.S.-Soviet summit next spring or summer, ``We may have
passed the last turn on the road'' toward a treaty reducing
strategic arms by 50 percent.
   There was a quick response from the White House. Bush said, ``I
am very pleased with the way things are going. The reaction from
the Soviets to our proposals yesterday has been positive so now the
goal is to get moving and try to work out these agreements.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called
Shevardnadze's statements ``a very constructive response. Our
ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons. And it
appears that both nations are now ready to act.''
   Shevardnadze also said that if NATO countries agree to start
talks on tactical nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union will respond by
further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.
   He repeated his government's call for a nuclear test ban and
said Moscow was considering extending a 1963 treaty to cover
underground nuclear explosions.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III later praised
Shevardnadze's nearly hour-long address as ``a good speech, an
interesting speech.'' He called it ``very responsive to the
President's statement'' on chemical weapons.
   But Viktor P. Karpov, the Soviet Union's chief arms control
expert, told reporters, ``Our proposal is a wider one'' and does
not wait to destroy all weapons or halt production until all
nations capable of producing them have signed a ban.
   ``It will not be sufficient only to get rid of old weapons if
the United States is going to produce new chemical weapons,''
Karpov said.
   Bush told the General Assembly on Monday that the United States
will destroy more than 80 percent of its chemical weapons, before
an international treaty banning use of the weapons is signed, if
the Soviet Union will reduce its arms to a similar level. That
would mean greater cuts by the Soviet Union, which has a larger
stockpile.
   Bush said in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty,
the United States would be ready to destroy 98 percent of its
arsenal if the Soviet Union joins the ban. The United States would
destroy all chemical weapons within 10 years once every nation
capable of building the weapons signs the treaty, he said.
   Shevardnadze said: ``The Soviet Union is ready, together with
the United States, to go further and assume mutual obligations
prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention.''
   The Soviet Union offered to:
   _ Cease production of chemical weapons, as it says it already
has done, including more sophisticated binary weapons.
   _ Renounce the use of ``those barbaric weapons'' under any
circumstances.
   _ Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production.
   Shevardnadze praised the U.S.-Soviet dialogue and said progress
had been made in recent talks.
   ``These talks have demonstrated the increasing awareness by both
sides of the need to cooperate for the benefit of mankind and the
growing confidence that such cooperation is possible.''
   Agreement to hold a summit meeting next year, he said, ``shows
that we have moved quite far ahead in solving a number of major
bilateral and international problems.''
   But he said extraordinary efforts at the highest level will be
needed to conclude an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in
strategic offensive arms. ``Our partners have accommodated us on
mobile intercontinental balistic missiles, he said. ``Positions on
other outstanding problems have become closer to each other.
   ``In our view, by the time the summit is held next year in late
spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the
road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms.''
   In a speech that praised the right of a people to choose its
government and course of development, Shevardnadze also wished
``every success'' to Poland's new government, the first East bloc
government not led by Communists. He pledged to cooperate with it.
   He also praised Bush's Open Skies proposal, which would allow
both nations to fly surveillance missions over the other's
territory.
   ``We like it ... The Soviet Union calls for opening up the
lands, the waters and outer space. Let us have Open Lands, Open
Seas and Open Space. Only then shall we attain absolute
transparency and the necessary level of confidence.''

   The spokesman of the leading political
party was shot and killed Tuesday, and a Marxist guerrilla group
claimed responsibility.
   The killing of Pavlos Bakoyannis took place hours before
Parliament was scheduled to debate the biggest bank scandal in the
nation's history. The guerrilla group, called November 17, has
accused Bakoyannis of having a role in the scandal.
   Police said Bakoyannis was shot at least five times in the chest
and stomach with a 45-caliber pistol from close range in the
hallway of his downtown office.
   The 54-year-old former journalist and magazine publisher was
rushed to the Evangelismos hospital, where he died on the operating
table, police said.
   Bakoyannis was elected to the 300-member unicameral Parliament
in June. He was the spokesman for the conservative New Democracy
party headed by his father-in-law, Constantine Mitsotakis.
   November 17 claimed responsibility in a 11{-page proclamation
scattered near the scene of the shooting.
   The group first surfaced with the assassination of Athens CIA
station chief Richard Welch in 1975. It also claimed responsibility
for the killing in June 1988 of U.S. defense attache William E.
Nordeen.
   The group takes its name from the day in 1973 when students at
the Athens Polytechnic Institute rose against the military
dictatorship that ruled from 1967 until it collapsed in 1974.
   It accused Bakoyannis, 54, of connections to a banker linked to
a scandal that contributed to the defeat in June elections of the
Socialist administration of former Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   After Papandreou's defeat, the New Democracy party forged a
governing alliance with the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress. The coalition is led by Prime Minister Tzannis
Tzannetakis, a deputy in Mitsotakis' party.
   Witnesses told police that two men had apparently been waiting
for Bakoyannis as he entered the building where his political
office is located.
   One witness said he heard many shots. Another told police that
after the gunshots, two men casually walked out of the building to
a waiting car about 50 yards away and drove off.
   Police said later that the getaway car was found abandoned about
a mile from the scene of the shooting.
   Mitsotakis rushed to the hospital along with his wife, Marika,
minutes after he learned his son-in-law had been shot. He was
joined later by his daughter, Dora, Bakoyannis' wife.
   The murder delayed for several hours the beginning of a two-day
debate on evidence allegedly linking Papandreou and four of his
senior Cabinet members to the $210 million Bank of Crete
embezzlement scandal.
   The former chairman of the Bank of Crete, George Koskotas, has
accused Papandreou and his ministers of skimming off interest from
deposits made by state-controlled corporations. He is in a Salem,
Mass. prison awaiting extradition to Greece.
   The debate is to end Wednesday, when Parliament is to vote on
whether to indict the accused and send them to a special high court
for trial.
   Parliament observed a minute of silence to honor Bakoyannis,
whose seat was covered with flowers.
   November 17 has claimed responsibility for at least 14 killings
and numerous bombings in its 13 years. Its victims have included
three senior U.S. officials, diplomats, industrialists and judges.

   Colombian President Virgilio Barco, facing
escalating violence by drug lords in his country, will meet with
President Bush at the White House on Thursday evening.
   Barco will stop in Washington on his way to New York to address
the United Nations, White House press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Tuesday
   The visit comes as bombings and violence continue to rock the
drug-trafficking plagued South American nation, in the wake of
Barco's crackdown to rid Colombia of drugs.
   On Monday and Tuesday, three explosions, attributed to drug
traffickers, blasted Cartagena and Bogota, killing two people.
   Asked if Bush would press Barco to request help from U.S.
troops, beyond the military equipment the administration already is
sending, Fitzwater said no.
   ``We have said from the beginning we would respond only to
requests by the president. We respect his rights and wishes as
president of that country, and whether or not he requests any more
aid in terms of money or troops or whatever is entirely within his
purview,'' Fitzwater said.
   The recent bombings, the spokesman said, ``are an exclamation
point to the danger there and to the desperation that the country
faces in terms of its drug problem. It strengthens the commitment
of everyone to continue the fight.''
   Bush has repeatedly expressed verbal support for Barco's efforts
against the drug traffickers and recently ordered $65 million in
military equipment and weaponry be sent to assist him.
   He also has requested $251 million from Congress for next year
to help Peru, Colombia and Bolivia in their drug wars.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Barco, in addition to the drug
situation, will talk about trade and U.S. aid to Colombia.
   Bush will meet with Barco in the residence quarters of the White
House after his return from the two-day education summit meeting
with the nation's governors in Charlottesville, Va.

   The 24 nations pooling aid for Poland
and Hungary agreed Tuesday on the urgency of introducing more
measures to support political and economic reforms in the two
East-bloc countries.
   In a final communique at the end of a one-day meeting, senior
officials from the 24 donor nations also urged Poland and Hungary
to reach agreements with the International Monetary Fund to
reschedule their foreign debts.
   Hungary's foreign debt is about $18 billion _ the highest per
capita in Eastern Europe _ and Poland's foreign debt is a
debilitating $39 billion.
   The European Community's executive commission, which is
coordinating the aid efforts _ has said rescheduling debts is
outside its mandate.
   The communique noted that $271 million worth of food aid has
been pledged by the 24 nations to be delivered to Poland and
Hungary.
   It was the second meeting by the 24 nations with another
scheduled for November.
   European Community officials put a $648 million price tag on the
new aid plan with half to be financed by the 12 EC member states
and the remainder by the 12 other donor nations.
   The U.S. delegation, which did not announce any new measures to
add to the $169 million already pledged, indicated it could find
additional funds and said the $648 million should be seen as a
minimum amount, not a ceiling.
   By the end of the meeting $133 million was promised by Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, Finland and Austria.
   The EC proposed paying $216 million from its 1990 budget toward
the new plan and suggested the European Community's 12 members
could provide $108 million more on a bilateral basis. The other
donors also would supply $324 million.
   Jacques Delors, president of the EC executive commission, and
Frans Andriessen, the EC external relations commisisoner, issued a
statement calling the process of political reform and economic
liberalization in Poland and Hungary ``still very fragile.''
   They said Poles and Hungarians ``could well find their new
freedoms threatened by economic disorders.''
   ``It would be unthinkable to allow such disorders, which could
be alleviated through rapid action, to undermine the prospects for
change in Eastern Europe,'' they added.
   Following are major provisions of the five-point air program
proposed Tuesday:
   _ To supply such goods as pesticides and farm machinery in
addition to food being sent to the Polish government. The food is
to be shipped free on condition the government uses the money from
sales to improve the private farm sector.
   _ To improve market access for Polish and Hungarian goods by
eliminating quantitative restrictions on their exports and offering
trade concessions.
   _ To grant both countries loans from the European Investment
Bank and include them in loan operations usually reserved for
developing nations.
   _ To provide professional training including banking and customs
to prepare Poland and Hungary for market-oriented economies.
   _ Cooperation to clean up industrialized areas and preserve
historical and cultural sites in both countries.
   EC participitation in the plan requires approval by the 12
governments and the European Parliament. The other donor nations
that also must approve the proposals are the six members of the
European Free Trade Association, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland, along with Japan, the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer, was in stable condition
Tuesday after suffering another relapse, according to his doctors.
   ``Duarte is on oxygen and suffering from fever,'' said Dr. Jose
Luis Saca.
   Duarte, 63, came down with pneumonia last week but responded to
treatment with antibiotics.
   He was taken to a private hospital Tuesday for lung X-rays and
other examinations.
   Duarte's son Alejandro told photographers that his father ``has
had a relapse but the relapse is not serious. He is breathing
normally, he is conscious and apparently has a lung problem.''
   Saca said Duarte will be transferred to Walter Reed Military
Hospital in Washington for a checkup in about 10 days ``when his
general condition improves.''
   He said the trip would be made to evaluate the cancer and decide
whether to resume chemotherapy.
   ``We doctors here consider that there is no need to give him
more chemotherapy because the cancer is no longer being
controlled,'' Saca said.
   When doctors at Walter Reed diagnosed Duarte's cancer in June
1988 they removed 60 percent of his stomach and found that the
disease had invaded his liver.
   Last June 1, Duarte became the first elected president of El
Salvador to turn his office over to another elected president.

   Less than 24 hours after President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev forcefully threatened to resolve the feud between Armenia
and Azerbaijan, cargo trains began running to Armenia ending an
economic blockade.
   Azerbaijani interference with cargo on the rail route into
Armenia had tightened to a total blockade over the past several
weeks.
   The Soviet evening news program Vremya on Tuesday said 14 trains
arrived in Armenia Monday night and Tuesday, delivering food,
medicine, newsprint and construction material desperately needed in
the area of Armenia devastated by last December's earthquake.
   But the film showed potatoes in the railroad cars were rotting
and crawling with maggots after three weeks of sitting outdoors.
The Vremya correspondent said none of the railcars contained fuel,
also critically needed.
   Gorbachev warned at Monday's session of the Soviet legislature
that the government would take tougher, unspecified steps to settle
the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute if the two republics cannot do it
themselves quickly. He did not elaborate.
   More than 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence in the
two republics the past 19 months, with much of the conflict
centering on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Newspapers in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, stopped publishing
last week for lack of newsprint and reconstruction in the
earthquake zone came to a standstill because of a shortage of
materials.
   Neither Soviet television nor the official news agency Tass gave
any explanation of how the trains reached their destinations after
weeks of delay.
   Tass said 17 trains left for Armenia from Baku, the capital of
Azerbaijan, between 6 p.m. Monday and 6 p.m. Tuesday. It said their
750 railcars contained construction supplies, food, vehicles,
machinery and other cargo.

   The school system for President Bush's current
home town _ the District of Columbia _ was not on the invitation
list for the White House-sponsored education summit this week.
   ``What I was told by federal education officials is that the
district wasn't invited to the summit because the city doesn't have
a governor,'' D.C. public schools spokeswoman Patricia Lambe said
Tuesday.
   Bush has invited the governors of the 50 states as well as
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to the two-day conference
beginning Wednesday in Charlottesville, Va.
   Under the home rule charter from Congress, the mayor acts as
chief executive for the nation's capital. But relations have
appeared strained previously between Bush administration and Mayor
Marion Barry.
   When administration officials disclosed a series of steps to
curtail drug trafficking and violence in the District of Columbia
earlier this year, Barry wasn't present for the announcement.
   Ms. Lambe said she was ``taken aback'' after none of the
district's education officials was invited to the meeting.
   ``After all, when the federal Department of Education releases
education statistics, their figures include the district as well as
the other 50 states,'' she said.
   Standardized test scores for all students last year were about
10 percent below the national average. The nation's capital's
public school system was also plagued by a 40 percent student drop
out rate.
   Lon Anderson, director of public affairs for the U.S. Department
of Education, said, ``The fact is no education representative was
invited from the city because the district is not a state'' and has
no governor.
   Anderson said Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were invited,
and noted that while they are not states, they have governors.

<HEAD>`Reverse Discrimination' Suit Filed By White Police Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven white police officers have sued the
city, charging that less qualified minority officers were promoted
unfairly ahead of them under a court-ordered affirmative action
plan.
   It could be the first test of a recent Supreme Court ruling that
reversed 20 years of affirmative action.
   Attorney Robert E. Gyemant said Tuesday he filed the ``reverse
discrimination'' suit against the city on behalf of the seven
officers Monday in order to obtain ``a colorblind and sex-blind
opportunity to advance.''
   Gyemant said the officers, standing with him at a news
conference, would most or all be captains or lieutenants if they
had been given an equal opportunity to advance. All are patrol
officers.
   The suit, filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court, claims
less qualified minority officers have been unfairly promoted in
order to meet racial quotas set by a 1979 court-ordered affirmative
action plan.
   The suit maintains that the city has violated a state civil
rights law forbidding the use of race or sex as a basis in hiring
and promotion.
   ``All I want is the opportunity to compete fairly,'' said
Officer Lawrence Ratti.
   Also at the news conference were four white female officers who
said they, too, suffered from discrimination. They are not involved
in the lawsuit.
   Officer Vicki Quinn described the city's promotion policies as
``a lottery.'' Quinn, a 13-year veteran of the force, said she was
one of the first women in the department who ``passed standards
held for men.''
   The lawsuit seeks back pay, punitive damages and an end to the
alleged discrimination. The amount of damages sought was not
revealed.
   The San Francisco suit may be the first test case for the
landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision involving Birmingham, Ala.,
that permitted a legal challenge to a court-order affirmative
action plan. The court decided that white firefighters in
Birmingham, hired after a consent decree was approved, could fight
the preferential promotion of allegedly less qualified black
firefighters.
   Gyemant, who called racial discrimination ``awful,'' said his
clients should not be forced to pay the price to ``right wrongs''
carried out before any of them were involved with the department.
   City Attorney Louise Renne said the lawsuit ``is plowing old
ground.''
   ``This has been going on for 10 years,'' she said. ``Just about
every legal point that could possibly have been raised has been.''
   But Gyemant responded: ``If it is old ground, then it certainly
is about time that we're able to deal with this in courts of law.''
   Only one sergeant's examination has been given in the San
Francisco Police Departmant in the last 10 years, and that was
declared recially discriminatory against whites by a federal judge,
he said.
   The lawsuit is not designed to fight steps taken to end
discrimination, Gyemant said.
   ``All we are saying is why make our clients pay for it. All they
did was serve the city well. That's what the lawsuit is all
about,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Slovenian communist leadership
on Tuesday unanimously endorsed proposed changes in the republic's
constitution that would give Slovenia the right to secede from
Yugoslavia, Tanjug news agency said.
   In addition, the federal presidency would have to seek Slovenian
approval to use Yugoslav army units in Slovenia.
   Belgrade radio said the Central Committee of the republic's
Communist Party ``expressed its determination'' to allow a final
vote on the amendments in the Slovenian parliament on Wednesday.
   Under the proposed amendments, Slovenia would have ``a lasting
and inalienable right to self-determination, including the right to
secession,'' Tanjug reported.
   Yugoslavia's collective eight-member presidency twice in the
past week issued statements saying the suggested amendments clashed
with the federal charter. The charter provides for the right of
each of Yugoslavia's six republics to secede, without specifying
how this could be accomplished.
   The national policy-setting Central Committee meanwhile met in
special session in Belgrade and wrangled over procedural issues
regarding the proposed constitutional amendments in Yugoslavia's
westernmost republic.
   Slovenian and Serbian party chiefs engaged in a sharp exchange.
   Slovenian party leader Milan Kucan said including the issue on
the agenda amounted to ``political pressure and restriction of the
sovereign will of the Slovenian people.''
   Bogdan Trifunovic, leader of Yugoslavia's largest Communist
Party of Serbia, said he considered Kucan's speech an open
declaration of hostilities.
   The Slovenian leadership said Tuesday the amendments in no way
contradicted the federal constitution.
   In a statement carried by Tanjug, Slovenia's ruling presidency
said federal criticism of the proposed changes could be construed
as indicating that the authorities were prepared to use force to
block their adoption.
   According to a report from Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia, the
Slovenian party Central Committee openly rejected criticism by the
federal authorities.

   John Poindexter will subpoena Ronald Reagan
and President Bush in an attempt to obtain their diaries and notes,
the former national security adviser said in court papers released
Tuesday.
   Facing a criminal trial next year in the Iran-Contra scandal,
Poindexter said he needs the records for his defense.
   ``Former President Reagan believes that his diaries and notes
are `personal' records,'' Poindexter said in the papers filed late
Monday and made available Tuesday.
   ``President Reagan's `personal' diaries and notes remain in the
former president's possession and were not transferred to the
National Archives'' when he left the White House, the court papers
said.
   Poindexter's lawyers said in court Sept. 6 that Reagan's notes
will reflect that he authorized some activities for which the
national security adviser was indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Poindexter said vice presidential records at the national
archives have yet to be processed and that to date no personal
diary from Bush's tenure as vice president has been discovered.
   Poindexter's lawyers also say he regularly briefed Bush on
aspects of the Iran-Contra affair following meetings which the vice
president missed.
   Poindexter said he intends to serve ``subpoenas on the former
president and former vice president personally.''
   Poindexter asked that U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene to
set a pre-trial return date for subpoenas of presidential and vice
presidential records and personal records of Reagan and Bush.
   The former national security adviser is charged with one count
of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Presidential Records Act says diaries, journals or other
personal notes of the president which aren't prepared in the course
of transacting government business don't have to be turned over to
the National Archives.
   The records act was enacted in the aftermath of the Watergate
scandal and lawsuits over ownership of the White House
tape-recordings during the presidency of Richard Nixon.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Tuesday
decried Moslem vs. Moslem violence and said guns, bombs and
extremism should only be used to fight the enemies of Islam.
   The official Libyan news agency Jana, monitored in Rome, said
Gadhafi told an Islamic seminar in Tripoli that fighting between
Moslem factions only benefits enemies of the faith.
   There is in Islam a ``multitude of contradicting movements ...
some of which we made, some the Americans made and some were made
by the Mossad or the KGB,'' he said, referring to Israel's Mossad
Secret Service and the Soviet Union's KGB secret police.
   Gadhafi said the movements include fundamentalists who want to
return to the Islamic basics and maintain the religion's
traditions, morals and customs and other factions that have taken
``a secret, violent, terrorist and extremist trend'' for reasons of
power or wealth.
   ``If such extremism was against the enemies of Islam, then we
all must be extremists and choose violence against the Israelis to
liberate the Holy Land and Palestine ... against the Americans and
against the enemies of Islam to stop them where they are,'' he said.
   Jana said that Gadhafi addressed some 250 Moslem clerics,
activists and leaders from 48 countries who went to the Libyan
capital for the seminar sponsored by the World Council for Islamic
Call and the Organization of Islamic Conference.
   The agency quoted Gadhafi as saying, ``This religion is dying if
it resorts to bombs, guns, knives, working in the dark and
sabotaging Islamic activity from the inside. ... It also means that
this religion declares its end, its bankruptcy and its inability to
hold a dialogue, to offer and to launch a holy war.''

<HEAD>Bush's Campaign Spending Reforms Sent to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House on Tuesday sent Congress the
legislative package containing Presidnet Bush's campaign spending
reforms announced earlier this summer.
   Bush is proposing to abolish nearly all special-interest
political action committees, which are the source of millions of
dollars in campaign funds for congressional candidates.
   Bush's proposal also would bar personal use of leftover campaign
funds, curtail free mailing privileges enjoyed by Congress and do
away with gerrymandering, the drawing of crazy-quilt congressional
districts to benefit certain candidates.
   The package also would prevent candidates from rolling over
campaign funds from one election to the next, a practice that helps
many incumbents scare off challengers.
   To infuse more money into the system, Bush would allow the
national political parties to spend more on their congressional
candidates than current election law allows.
   Bush also wants full public disclosure of so-called soft money,
which refers to funds that are prohibited in federal campaigns but
permitted at the state or local level in many cases. Critics
contend that soft money contributions find their way into the
federal election process anyway.
   In a statement to Congress accompanying the package, he said his
proposals were ``designed to reduce substantially the power of
special economic interests while enhancing the role of individuals
and political parties.''
   On political action committees, Bush would specifically ban
federal contributions from PACs sponsored by unions, corporations
and trade associations. Critics contend that campaign donations
from these PACs give them undue influence over the votes of the
Congress members who receive them.
   Bush announced the proposals in June and put them into
legislative form that he sent to Congress on Tuesday.
   He also has announced his support for a pay raise for Congress
members, but has sent no specific proposal, leaving that effort to
Congress itself.

   Moslem warlords on Tuesday dismissed as
inadequate proposed political reforms aimed at ending 14 years of
civil war in Lebanon, with Druse chief Walid Jumblatt declaring,
``The military battle is not over yet.''
   Police said a 3-day-old cease-fire that ended six months of
Syrian-Christian shelling duels was generally holding, with only
intermittent sniping duels across the dividing Green Line in the
capital.
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday issued the Vatican's first formal
appeal ever to Moslems, pleading for their help in saving Lebanon.
In a separate document, he called for a ``mobilization'' by
Catholics for Lebanon and announced a world day of prayer for this
war-torn country.
   Under a peace plan issued by a three-man Arab League committee,
Lebanon's surviving 73 Parliament members will meet Saturday in
Saudi Arabia to discuss the reform plans.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, predicted
at least 60 lawmakers would participate.
   The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems in
Lebanon. Maronite Catholics have dominated the government,
judiciary and army command in Lebanon since independence from
France in 1943.
   Jumblatt and Shiite militia leader Nabih Berri attacked the
proposals, which were welcomed by other Lebanese politicians.
   ``The military battle is not over yet and will not be finished
on the basis of a new fragile sectarian compromise contained in the
tripartite committee's draft plan,'' Jumblatt told a group of
sympathizers.
   Berri said in a statement the reform plan was ``not enough.''
   ``The constitution which they want to change gives us more than
the Arab tripartite committee's plan for reforms,'' Berri
complained.
   Under the present system, Lebanon is governed by a Maronite
president, with a Sunni Moslem prime minister and a Shiite
Parliament speaker. Many government jobs were allocated on the
basis of a ratio of six Christians to five Moslems.
   At the time the arrangement came about, Christians formed a
majority of Lebanon's population. Now they are outnumbered by
Moslems.
   According to the daily paper An-Nahar, the Arab League peace
committee has worked out a plan under which the number of
Parliament seats would be increased from 99 to 128, to be
distributed equally between Moslems and Christians.
   The reforms would limit the president's authority in naming and
dismissing Moslem prime ministers and would stipulate that they be
elected by Parliament, An-Nahar reported.
   The present 99-seat Parliament was elected in 1972, three years
before civil war broke out. Sectarian strife has prevented general
elections and the house has periodically voted to renew its
four-year mandate. Twenty-six vacancies now exist.
   A Sunni Parliament member, speaking on condition he not be
further identified, said leaders of the militias and other fighting
forces ``are against any settlement because it will strip them of
the privileges they enjoyed when their men ruled Lebanon by rifle.''

   More than two-thirds of the Senate urged the
Bush administration Tuesday to deny any visa request from Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
   Fifty-eight House members also wrote to President Bush,
contending Arafat should be denied a visa because he has not lived
up to his December promises to renounce terrorism and to recognize
Israel's right to exist.
   The 68 senators, 34 Democrats and 34 Republicans, made the same
point in a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
added:
   ``The PLO is on a collision course with the peace process.
Arafat and the PLO must reaffirm and implement, in deed and in
word, the statements of just nine months ago.
   ``Rewarding the PLO at this time would undercut the peace
process, call into question the seriousness of U.S. anti-terrorism
policy, be (contrary) to American interests and threaten the
security of Israel.''
   Both groups of lawmakers noted that former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz had denied Arafat a visa to address the General
Assembly last November. Shultz cited a U.S. law giving the
government the right to deny entry to anyone believed to have
engaged in terrorism, either as an individual or as a member of an
organization.
   Arafat has not applied for a visa this year but is widely
expected to do so. The denial of his visa request last year led to
an uproar at the United Nations and an invitation for him to
address a specially convened General Assembly session in Geneva.
   At a news conference, several of the lawmakers who signed the
letters said their intention was not to derail the dialogue between
Arafat and U.S. diplomats underway since his December pledge.
   ``This is not a message to halt the dialogue, but it is a
message that we want the dialogue to produce results,'' said Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., noted that the number of senators
requesting Arafat be denied a visa was 17 higher than the number
who had signed a similar letter to Shultz last year.
   ``This is an indication there is less trust for Mr. Arafat today
and an indication we believe his words are hollow,'' Mack said.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., dismissed reports that Arafat had
agreed to endorse the terms of a 10-point peace proposal initiated
By Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``Talk is cheap,'' Wilson said.
   Signing the letter to Baker were 34 Democrats and 34 Republicans.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Stay In Shelter Can't Jeopardize Food Stamps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A brief stay in a battered women's shelter
can't jeopardize food stamp benefits, a federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin said the U.S. Department
of Agriculture violated its own regulations when it directed a
cutoff of food stamps for two women this year after they left
shelters for battered women.
   The USDA said payments by the state to battered women's shelters
had to be considered income when calculating the food stamp
eligibility of individual women who use the shelters.
   But MacLaughlin ruled Monday that the state's per-day payments
to 16 shelters around the state should be considered emergency
assistance, not a substitute for the shelter costs that are part of
a family's welfare grant.
   ``A battered woman does not come to a shelter to find housing,''
he wrote. ``She comes because she needs protection from imminent
physical danger and help in ending an abusive relationship.''
   The judge said fewer than half of the women who seek shelter can
be accommodated by existing facilities and the average stay is only
13 days.
   He gave the federal government and the Minnesota Department of
Human Services 60 days to come up with a plan for giving back to
welfare recipients the food stamps that were wrongfully withheld
from them while the policy was in effect, from Aug. 1, 1988, to
April 1 of this year.
   Charles Thomas, an attorney with Southern Minnesota Regional
Legal Services in Mankato, sued on behalf of the two women from
that southern Minnesota city of about 29,000 people.
   He said the lawsuit was a class action involving about 2,000
women and children in Minnesota who were hurt by the policy. The
ruling requires they be identified and reimbursed, he said.
   For one of the Mankato women, the amount was $250; for the
other, $124, Thomas said.
   ``While we may not look at the amount as especially significant,
to these women it may mean survival,'' said Assistant Attorney
General Gail Olson. Olson said the state agreed with Thomas'
position that the shelter services should not be considered income
but was forced to go along with the federal interpretation or face
sanctions.
   ``There was more at stake here besides benefits,'' said Loretta
Frederick, director of legal advocacy for the Minnesota Coalition
for Battered Women. Frederick said the federal policy had the
``absurd result'' of forcing women to choose between getting their
children out of an unsafe home or feeding them.
   Some women were not going into shelters, or were leaving shortly
after getting into them, because they could not afford to go
without food stamps, she said.

<HEAD>State Sets Fat Content Standards For Lunches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new California law sets a limit on
the amount of fat allowed in school lunches and was the result of a
lawmaker's shock at the quality of food served at a school in her
district.
   The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, requires the state Board
of Education to set fat and cholesterol levels for all school
lunches, and orders the board to force the California's 1,000-plus
school districts to follow the standards.
   The legislation is aimed at high-fat, low-food-value lunches
that often serve as the sole source of a child's daily nourishment.
The bill was signed last week by the governor.
   ``I'm sad to say that for many children, the school lunch they
eat is the most balanced meal they receive all day,'' said
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier, author of the law. ``This is
particularly alarming when that lunch consists of a corn dog and
tater tots.''
   A group called The Public Voice for Food and Health Policy,
based in Washington, D.C., has issued a report that says the
federal government supplies about a third of the food used in more
than 24 million lunches served daily at 91,000 schools. The foods
include high-fat content items such as ground beef, pork, luncheon
meat, ham, butter, cheese and eggs.
   Health authorities generally agree that the daily fat intake for
school children should be no more than 30 percent of total calories.

<HEAD>US Inviting Soviets To See Star Wars Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. negotiator to the superpower
Defense and Space Talks in Geneva said Tuesday he hopes the Soviets
will accept a U.S. invitation to visit two Star Wars research sites.
   ``I would be hopeful ... that we could work out the arrangements
in the coming round so that the trip could take place in the coming
months,'' Ambassador Henry F. Cooper told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing.
   The negotiator discussed the invitation extended by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III in his talks over the weekend with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming.
   Cooper said he intends to press ahead with the offer in the new
round of Geneva talks, which begin Friday.
   Cooper said that Shevardnadze had reacted positively to Baker's
invitation, but that he could not characterize the Soviet reaction
as an acceptance. The Soviets have resisted such exchanges in the
past.
   ``It has been our agenda from the beginning to get the Soviets
to talk to us in a direct way about our research activities and our
testing activities and their research activities and testing
activities,'' Cooper said.
   ``We are hopeful the Soviets will accept this invitation. ... It
was made without conditions. We hope it will provide a basis then
for discussions in Geneva that will lead them to accept an exchange
in the future of such visits,'' he said.
   The invitation is intended to promote openness between the two
nations by allowing the Soviets to learn more about U.S. research
being conducted into the space-based anti-missile defense called
the Strategic Defense Initiative, more commonly known as Star Wars.
   The U.S.-Soviet talks in Geneva on slashing long-range nuclear
weapons have been deadlocked over the Soviet demand that a treaty
be contingent on completion of a separate agreement on space-based
defenses.
   U.S. refusal to end its research into a Star Wars missile
defense made an arms reduction accord improbable.
   Over the weekend in Wyoming, however, the Soviets said they
would no longer insist that curbs on Star Wars be in place before a
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty could be reached. The START talks
are also going on in Geneva, parallel to the space and defense
talks.
   At the Wyoming session, the U.S. side invited a group of Soviet
experts to visit the Los Alamos, N.M., National Laboratory and the
TRW Corp.'s test facility in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
   Cooper said the Soviets would be able to observe at Los Alamos
the first particle beam device that was flown in space earlier this
year and observe at the TRW facility the space-based laser project.
   Cooper stressed that the U.S. invitation is not contingent on a
reciprocal invitation from the Soviets.
   He noted that the Soviets have complained about the two research
sights, and the visits would provide the opportunity ``to gain more
information about these activities adn build confidence by reducing
the risk of technological surprises.''
   Cooper said that the invitation was to be extended to Soviet
experts working in the field, and that he expected five to 10
individuals would come if the offer is accepted.
   The ambassador said he was convinced the Soviets are moving
ahead with their own research into space-based defensive system.
   ``I believe they are still working quite deliberately in this
area,'' he said. ``If they know how to solve this problem
techically, I have personally no doubt they will be moving to
deploy ballistic missile defenses.''

   Citing a lack of evidence, a judge
dropped charges against two reputed leaders of the Medellin drug
cartel accused in the assassination of Colombia's attorney general,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, hundreds of tourists boarded planes, buses and taxis
out of the Caribbean city of Cartagena after a bomb exploded at the
Hilton Hotel there and killed two people.
   Later Tuesday, a bomb exploded in a crowded supermarket in a
northern Bogota suburb, injuring five people, police said. The
bomb, tossed by an assailant who escaped in a car, damaged the
front of the Carulla market, neighboring buildings and a car parked
nearby, police said.
   In the five weeks since drug lords declared war on the
government for trying to crack down on narcotics traffickers, there
have been 111 bombings, most of them in this capital, Medellin and
Cali. Eight people have been killed by those bombs, and 137
injured, according to police statistics.
   Also Tuesday, the M-19 leftist guerrilla group urged the
government to pardon drug traffickers and stop extraditing them to
the United States. The statement appeared in a full page ad
published in the country's biggest newspaper, El Tiempo.
   El Tiempo also reported that in Medellin, a judge Monday dropped
charges against Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria and Jose Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, alleged leaders of the Medellin-based drug
operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the United States.
   The men are on the U.S. Justice Department list of 12 key drug
figures wanted for prosecution in the United States. The judge's
action would not prevent their extraditions.
   A prosecutor told the newspaper he would appeal federal judge
Francisco Cardenas' decision. The Associated Press could not get
through by telephone to the judge's office in Medellin.
   Escobar and Rodriguez, who have offered to negotiate with the
government, had been charged with complicity in last year's
kidnapping of Andres Pastrana, who was a candidate for mayor of
Bogota. Pastrana was freed in an army raid and went on to be
elected mayor of the capital.
   Escobar and Rodriguez were charged with planning the Jan. 25
assassination of Colombia's attorney general, Carlos Hoyos.
   The Cartagena bomb was one of the worst to have gone off in
Colombia's major cities since drug traffickers and the government
went to war Aug. 18. No one claimed responsibility for the bomb,
which went off Monday night.
   The explosion killed two doctors and wounded a third, said the
chief of the national police in Cartagena, Col. Luis Herrera.
   Another bomb exploded in front of a Cartagena bank Monday night,
injuring one person, Herrera said.
   An American businessman with a store in Cartagena told The
Associated Press tourists were desperate to get out of the city.
   The few outbound flights were booked, and tourists were jamming
the airport on a stand-by basis, he said by telephone, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Tourists unable to find space on flights were snapping up
tickets at bus stations and hiring taxis to take them to other
cities, he said.
   Cartagena has become popular with Canadian and U.S. tourists and
is a frequent stop for Caribbean cruise ships.
   The Hilton evacuated an estimated 1,500 guests to other hotels
Monday night, according to the American.
   Colombian marines and army troops patrolled the city Tuesday,
searching cars and frisking pedestrians.
   The guerrillas' ad published in El Tiempo proposed immediate
negotiations between the government and drug traffickers.
   The proposal was not tied to the anticipated signing of a peace
agreement between M-19 and President Virgilio Barco's government.
The treaty would pardon guerrillas and allow them to set up a
political party, but it has been delayed in the last two days as
the guerrillas and government negotiators continue to work out
details.
   The guerrillas said in their ad that drug traffickers should be
pardoned and the government should refused to extradite them to
United States.
   The Colombian government and the army have long claimed that
drug traffickers and many of the estimated 10,000 combatants in six
guerrilla groups in Colombia are working together.
   The M-19 is the only guerrilla group negotiating with the
government.
   M-19 took over Colombia's Palace of Justice in 1985. The
takeover and a cannon and machine gun assault by the army left 95
people dead.
   The group was formed in 1970 by dissidents who claimed a
presidential election that year was fraudulent. Since then, it has
used assassinations, kidnappings, plane hijackings and attacks on
military bases and government installations in its attempt to
topple the government.

   Israeli officials on Tuesday welcomed President
Bush's proposal to eliminate chemical weapons, but experts
suggested the Middle East would pose a major problem area for
putting the plan into effect.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Israel backed the call for wiping out stockpiles but declined to
comment on the possibility of doing so within 10 years as Bush
proposed.
   ``Israel supports very much the banning of all chemical
weapons,'' he said.
   ``We have warned many times that Arab countries are arming
themselves with such weapons and have in some cases used them
against civilian populations.''
   Pazner noted Iraq and Iran used chemical weapons during the
8-year Persian Gulf conflict and reports also surfaced of Syria and
Libya manufacturing them.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``Israel's position is that we are totally against
stocking or using chemical weapons and any action that leads to the
suppression of chemical arms is welcomed and supported by Israel.
   ``We hope that there will be a worldwide movement so that all
these weapons will be destroyed and never put to use again.''
   Bush proposed Monday that America would eliminate all of its
chemical arms within 10 years if the Soviet Union and other
countries do the same.
   Israeli military analyst Aharon Levran, a retired army brigadier
general, said Arab countries probably would balk at giving up
chemical weapons that they saw as a counter to Israel's reported
nuclear capability.
   He also suggested Arab countries may attach political
conditions, such as Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in war
with Arab states.
   Israel has never confirmed it, but foreign reports say Israel
has nuclear and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles
capable of delivering them.
   Israel is considering nationwide deployment of protective masks
to counter the eventuality of chemical weapons. Civil defense
authorities are conducting a yearlong trial in which 3,000
residents of two towns were given such masks.
   Israeli soldiers have been equipped with modern, protective
masks and suits as well as detection and decontamination equipment.
   Iraq is known to have chemical weapons, including mustard gas
and the nerve agent Sarin. It used mustard gas against enemy
soldiers while fighting Iran, and against civilians in Kurdistan,
according to an assessment by Levran and members of an Israeli
research group.
   Syria has extensive stockpiles of chemical weapons, including
the nerve gas Sarin, the report said. Libya also is believed to
have poison gas. Egypt also has stockpiles of poison gas, according
to the report by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel
Aviv.
   Levran said he doubted Iraq would heed Bush's call.
   ``The Iraqis are afraid that one day the Iranians will amass the
forces and overrun them,'' he said.

   Leftist rebels attacked
government forces in scattered raids in nine provinces Tuesday and
military officials said 39 soldiers and guerrillas were killed.
   The rebels have agreed to peace talks and a communique said
Tuesday's actions were in response to government repression.
   The communique, broadcast on the rebels' clandestine radio
station, called the attacks a ``Halt the repression!'' offensive
and said it was ordered because of the arrests of dozens of
unionists.
   Military officials said guerrillas attacked targets in nine of
El Salvador's 14 provinces. They listed the casualties as 26
guerrillas and 13 soldiers killed and 18 soldiers, 15 guerrillas
and 6 civilians wounded.
   It was the broadest rebel offensive since May 10 when the
guerrillas attacked positions in 10 provinces. And it was the first
series of coordinated attacks by the guerrillas since government
and rebel representatives held preliminary peace talks in Mexico
City Sept. 13-15.
   An 11-day cease-fire declared unilaterally by the rebels ended
Sunday.
   The rebel communique spoke of the ``fascist brutality'' of the
rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani, referring to
accusations by detainees that they were tortured and raped last
week at National Police headquarters.
   It said in part, ``Just as we have been flexible and broadminded
in order to negotiate, we are likewise completely disposed to, and
capable of accompanying the struggle of the entire people.''
   The document was signed by the five main rebel commanders,
including Joaquin Villalobos and Schafik Handal took part in the
Mexico City peace talks.
   Another round of negotiations is to take place in Costa Rica
Oct. 16-17.
   Cristiani's government has denied the allegations of brutatlity
and said it acted legitimately against the unionists because
participants in their march last week burned two buses.
   All but 18 of the 71 unionists detained had been released by
Tuesday. Those still in custody have been charged with terrorism,
subversive activity and illegal association.
   The rebel communique also accused the government of taking
advantage of the guerrilla cease-fire to move troops into
rebel-controlled areas and to bombard civilian zones in the north
and east.
   A 10-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front and a succession of U.S.-backed
governments has taken an estimated 70,000 lives, with most of the
victims civilians.

<HEAD>Defense Firm Pleads Guilty to Bribing Marine Corps Official</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 1 graf with comment from Ingram's lawyer.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A defense company, two former executives
and a defense consultant pleaded guilty Tuesday to bribing a Marine
Corps official in a scheme to get electronic contracts worth $7.7
million.
   Whittaker Command and Control Systems, a Whittaker Corp.
subsidiary, agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and penalties for
its part in the scheme to bribe Marine Corps contracting official
Jack Sherman.
   Guilty pleas were also entered by Scott M. Lamberth, former
president of the Whittaker subsidiary, John F. Van Tassel, the
operations director of its Fayetteville, Ark., facility and San
Diego defense consultant Donald Illeman. All three men agreed to
cooperate with the FBI's continuing investigation dubbed
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   A federal grand jury investigating the case, meanwhile, indicted
defense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon and another former Whittaker
Command executive, Leonard L. Ingram, on charges of participating
in the same bribery scheme.
   Muldoon, targeted by investigators as an important figure in the
case, and Ingram were charged in the 16-count indictment with
conspiracy, bribery and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   In its guilty plea, the company admitted funneling more than
$80,000 to Sherman between 1982 and 1988 through three defense
consultants, including Illeman. The scandal stemmed from the
awarding and expansion of contracts to provide electronic
components for a battlefield air traffic control system.
   The guilty plea by Whittaker Command and Control Systems is the
third by a corporation in the continuing investigation of Pentagaon
procurement fraud that has resulted in convictions of more than 20
officials, consultants and businessmen.
   Teledyne Electronics and Hazeltine Corp. have both pleaded
guilty for their roles in the procurement scandal.
   According to a company lawyer and court papers, Whittaker Corp.
officials were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began when the
subsidiary was a private company called Lee Telecommunications.
   The bribery scheme was conceived in 1981 when Lee
Telecommunications started having financial troubles, according to
court papers filed in the case in U.S. District Court.
   Whittaker Corp. acquired Lee Telecommunications in 1986, later
merging it with another subsidiary to form Whittaker Command and
Control Systems. Lamberth and Ingram were stockholders of Lee
Telecommunications and became, respectively, president and vice
president of the Whittaker subsidiary.
   Lamberth, 59, deliberately hid the bribery scheme from officials
of the parent company after the acquisition, the court papers said.
   ``The board of directors and the present officers of the company
do not have first-hand knowledge of he facts,'' Whittaker's
attorney Daniel H. Bookin told U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton.
   ``No one who is involved in those activities is currently with
the company,'' Bookin said, but the corporate officers ``see
sufficient evidence to conclude that a guilty plea is appropriate.''
   Sherman, who received an 18-month prison term for taking other
bribes, helped Lee Telecommunications get a $600,000 contract in
1982 to build computers for the battlefield traffic-control system.
He subsequently authorized several modifications that increased its
value to more than $2.6 million, according to court papers.
   He also increased the value of another contract from $540,000 to
$3.6 million by authorizing additional work. Sherman later
authorized the transfer of a $1.6 million worth of additional
computer software work to Lee Telecommunications from a firm that
could not perform its contract.
   Lamberth faces a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to
$500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery.
   Illeman, 64, and Van Tassel, 53, could each be sentenced up to
15 years and fined $250,000 for their pleas to bribery charges.
   Hilton scheduled sentencing for Lamberth and Van Tassel on Dec.
15 and for Illeman on Jan. 12.
   The indictment charged that the company paid more than $200,000
to Muldoon, Illeman and another defense consultant, John Marlowe,
who is cooperating with the government, to share with Sherman.
   Ingram is accused in the indictment of submitting _ after the
``Ill Wind'' investigation became public _ a phony invoice to the
Marine Corps to obtain reimbursement for $30,000 paid to Illeman,
who told investigators he shared part of it with Sherman.
   Muldoon's attorney, Albert Ahern Jr., said his client refused a
government offer to plead guilty, and will fight the charges in
court. ``Muldoon denies it all, denies there was any criminal
intent on his part at any time,'' Ahern said.
   Ingram's attorney, Marcus Topel, vowed to fight the charges in
court. ``I think this is a classic case of guilt by association,''
the San Francisco lawyer said. ``I think the trial will show he had
absolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities, and
at most was present at various times when they were discussed and
did nothing further than that.''

   The Vermont Supreme Court on Tuesday
barred a former justice from hearing cases in retirement after
finding him guilty of misconduct while on the bench.
   William Hill, 72, received the harshest possible penalty for
seven violations of judicial canons, including his participation in
cases involving a a friend, who was then an assistant judge.
   Hill was the first justice of the Vermont Supreme Court to be
found guilty of judicial misconduct. Special prosecutor Douglas
Richards said he sought the reprimand and suspension to assure
judges are held to the highest standards.
   The allegations against Hill first came to light in January 1987
and he retired that April when his term ended. He was first
appointed in 1976.
   Hill has repeatedly refused to comment on the allegations.
   Michael Marks, Hill's lawyer, urged justices not to suspend him,
saying that his reputation has suffered irreparable harm.
   ``At most, Justice Hill was guilty of misjudgments,'' said
Marks. ``After 28 years in service to this court and to the
judiciary, this is the blemish of his record, the blemish on which
some people may remember him.''
   Hill was found guilty last week of ethics violations. He was
also found guilty of intimidating state Attorney General Jeffrey
Amestoy by personally delivering a letter to him urging a criminal
investigation of Jane Wheel be speeded up.
   Wheel was then an assistant judge, an elected official who helps
presiding Superior Court judges. She pleaded no contest to
allegations of judicial misconduct and faces a jail term for her
perjury conviction in a separate proceeding.
   As a retired justice, Hill could have been asked to preside over
cases but he had not been used since his retirement.

   RHEIN-MAIN AIR BASE, West Germany (AP) _ Veterans of the Berlin
airlift on Tuesday commemorated the crews who daily flew tons of
supplies to break a Soviet blockade of Germany's former capital
that ended 40 years ago.
   Among the 350 people attending the ceremony were former U.S.
Navy and Army Air Force teams who risked their lives ferrying food
to West Berliners during the 462-day Soviet blockade that began on
June 26, 1948.
   At least 79 aviation crewmembers lost their lives during the
dramatic airlift that ended on Sept. 30, 1949, after 2.3 million
tons of food and life-sustaining equipment were dropped into the
city surrounded by what is now East Germany to keep 2{ million West
Berliners nourished and warm.
   ``It would take about 20 hours to fly here in a C54,'' recalled
former Navy pilot A.L. Jones of Phoenix. ``We'd land in
Newfoundland, the Azores, then on to Rhein-Main (West Germany) to
get here.''
   Jets now make the flight in one-third that time.
   ``No other event shows the turning point of German-American
relations as impressively as the Berlin Airlift,'' said Wilhelm
Knittel, deputy West German transportation minister, at the
memorial ceremony.
   ``With the aid of the United States of America and through the
strong will of the Berliners to remain free, the city became a
symbol of freedom in the world,'' Knittel said.
   Tommy Tomlinson, a 92-year-old former U.S. Navy captain, laid a
wreath at the foot of Rhein-Main's airlift memorial, a large cement
monument pointed in the direction of Berlin.
   Tomlinson, of Silverton, Ore., is the oldest surviving Berlin
airlift pilot, and was in charge of U.S. Navy squadrons VR6 and VR8
based at Rhein-Main during the airlift.
   Some pilots rose to fame during the dramatic 15-month airlift,
like retired Air Force Lt. Col. Gail S. Halvorsen, known as the
``Candy Bomber'' for his idea of dropping raisins and sweets to
Berlin children. But the airlift was a success because of the
involvement of thousands behind the scenes.
   ``I was a store keeper in charge of ordering parts to repair and
help keep those airplanes flying,'' said 68-year-old Ellis Dickson
of Cupertino, Calif., as he watched the ceremony. ``We worked a lot
of long, hard hours doing it.''
   The reunion of former airlift crews was organized by the Airlift
Associations in Frankfurt and West Berlin.

<HEAD>FAA Giving Airlines More Time To Develop Drug Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
extending its deadline for air carriers to submit plans for
anti-drug programs, including random testing of employees,
officials said Tuesday.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said 22 of 130 carriers using planes
capable of carrying more than 30 passengers have failed to submit
their plans, orginally due Aug. 18. A federally mandated anti-drug
program for the aviation industry takes effect Dec. 18.
   The new deadline for submitting proposals is Oct. 9, Farrar said.
   He said just over 100 companies using smaller planes have
submitted proposals for implementing the program, which requires
employment, post-accident and random drug testing.
   FAA officials said it is difficult to tell how many of the
estimated 3,000 smaller aviation companies might be covered by the
law, since it covers only those with more than 50 employees.
   The agency has sent letters to hundreds of companies warning
them that it will take legal action if they fail to meet the Oct. 9
deadline.
   ``The FAA recognizes that since this is a new requirement and
involves comprehensive planning and implementation, the airline
industry has faced numerous difficult tasks in developing anti-drug
plans,'' the FAA letters say.
   Airlines that fail to comply face penalties of up to $10,000 for
each day their plan has not been submitted. Farrar said no fines
will be assessed until after the new deadline.
   The FAA has 60 days to approve each company's plan.

   Supporters of President Bush's clean air bill
defeated an attempt Tuesday to make it require auto exhausts
cleaner than those now in force in smog-plagued California.
   The tough provision proposed by Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,
was defeated by voice vote in the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee he chairs.
   The subcommittee is considering amendments to Bush's legislation
to clean the skies of ozone, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals.
   The outnumbered Waxman, who is closely allied with environmental
organizations, accepted defeat without a roll call, saying he
wanted to avoid forcing members to take a public position against
stringent automobile controls.
   Waxman, promising to return with a compromise that still would
toughen Bush's auto requirments, said, ``Sometimes you don't want
them on record so they can re-think their position and come
around.''
   Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., ranking Republican on the parent
committee and the main GOP sponsor of the Bush legislation, said
Waxman's proposals would have cost consumers an extra $500 per car
if fully implemented for model year 2000. For that expense, he said
pollution under Waxman's plan would only be cut an additional 2.7
percent compared with the Bush legislation.
   Estimates of the cost of current auto emissions contols have
clustered around $1,500 per car in recent years.
   Lent said the technology doesn't exist to meet the Waxman
standards, which he said represented ``the dreams of the authors
and have no basis in technological fact.''
   Whatever happens in the subcommittee, the battle over auto
standards is expected to surface again in the full Energy and
Commerce Committee and the House floor. The Senate has not yet
begun work on clean air legislation.
   Motor vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution, in
some areas the principal contributor, through the emission of
unburned fuel vapors. They also emit oxides of nitrogen and carbon
monoxide
   Ozone, the prime ingredient of smog, is produced by the reaction
of hydrocarbons _ unburned fuel _ and nitrogen oxides in the
presence of sunlight and heat. Because of its ozone problems,
California has tougher auto pollution standards than the rest of
the nation.
   Waxman's plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25
grams per mile _ the standard for California starting in 1995 _
from 1993 through 1999, and 0.125 grams per mile after that.
Outside California, cars are limited to 0.41 grams per mile under
current law.
   Nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to acid rain, would have
been capped at 0.4 grams per mile from 1993 through 1999, down from
1 gram now, and 0.2 grams after 1999.
   Waxman's proposed limit for carbon monoxide was 3.4 grams per
mile from 1992 through 1999, the current standard, and 1.7 grams
afterwards.
   The administration's proposed standard for hydrocarbons is 0.25
grams per mile by 1998; for nitrogen oxides, 0.7 grams by the same
year; and for carbon monoxide, retention of the current 3.4 gram
limit.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., who supported Waxman, said, ``We are
really in the dark. Our eyes glaze over at these numbers.''

   About 130 East German refugees out
of about 1,200 camped out in the West German Embassy garden left
the compound Tuesday to accept an offer of guaranteed emigration
within six months of returning home.
   But refugees estimated that about 120 newcomers scaled the
embassy fence Tuesday. New refugees arrived while people boarded
buses to leave at the other end of the compound.
   East German emissary Manfred Vogel said those willing to return
could emigrate without facing prosecution for ``flight from the
republic'' and other offenses.
   The 130 or so refugees left the embassy in two buses and private
cars, and spokesmen said an additional 100 intend to follow them
Wednesday.
   The flow of East German refugees into Poland also increased
Tuesday, with some camping out on streets near the West German
Embassy in Warsaw, uncertain where they would spend the night. The
number of refugees appeared to have risen to more than 400 people.
Newcomers registered with West German officials at a kiosk near the
embassy staffed by a member of the diplomatic staff.
   On the Austrian border with Hungary, authorities said Tuesday
that the number of East Germans crossing into Austria since Hungary
opened its borders for them stood at 21,424 Tuesday morning, about
950 more than the day before.
   From Austria, the East Germans rapidly proceed to West Germany,
which offers them immediate citizenship.
   Czechoslovakia is between West Germany and Hungary.
   Refugees said East German emissaries in Prague would hold two
sessions Wednesday to submit their offer for more people to vacate
the West German mission and go home.
   All East German citizens who announce themselves ready to leave
the Bonn Embassy receive a piece of paper to serve as a document
for them to cross the East German border without trouble at two
checkpoints.
   Spokesmen for the refugees who took part in the negotiations
said Vogel issued a written guarantee which was handed over to West
German government officials taking part in the talks.
   The guarantee reportedly stipulates the right to emigrate within
six months after returning to East Germany.
   Even while Vogel conferred with the refugees, newcomers arrived,
most of them families with children.
   The embassy in Warsaw, crowded with refugees, was closed last
week to prevent more people from entering. At least some of the
newly arrived East Germans were told to fend for themselves Monday
evening in finding a place to sleep.
   Part of the overflow was absorbed by a former seminary at
Tarchomin, just outside Warsaw, lent by Roman Catholic Church
officials to the West German authorities. There the number of East
German inhabitants was up to 152 on Tuesday, compared to just 16 a
week ago, according to occupants.
   The back of the seminary looked like a parking lot in Dresden,
with more than 20 vehicles, mostly East German-made Wartburgs and
Trabants.
   The streets around the embassy in the Warsaw residential
district of Saska Kepa also contained East German cars, some with
license plates removed as a symbol that their owners did not plan
to return to East Germany.

   Federal investigators looking into the crash of
a USAir jet said Tuesday that almost all the tread on the front
tires was gone, but there was no indication the wheels had jammed.
   The finding about the front wheels would be consistent with the
pilot's statements that he had tried o bring the jet to a halt
before it skidded off the runway into the East River on Sept. 20,
said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a National Transportation Safety Board
spokesman.
   Two people were killed and 59 others were rescued from the water
after the pilot aborted takeoff of Flight 5050 at LaGuardia Airport.
   Although 95 percent of the tread on the front tires was gone,
the main landing gear under the wings looked normal, Lopatkiewicz
said. The wing flaps were all in normal takeoff position.
   Investigators reported earlier that the front wheels were locked
sharply to the right, indicating that the pilot had turned the
tiller to counteract a drift to the left.
   Capt. Michael W. Martin told investigators that he aborted the
takeoff because the aircraft was moving left and he felt and heard
a strange vibration.
   Investigators planned to look inside the engines of the Boeing
737-400 for additional clues to the cause of the crash.
   John J. Santucci, district attorney for the borough of Queens,
who has launched a grand jury investigation of the pilots' conduct,
said Monday that urine samples taken two days after the accident
contained no sign of drug or alcohol use by the pilot or copilot of
Flight 5050.
   Martin and his copilot, Constantine Kleissas, were criticized by
federal officials for failing to submit to testing immediately
after the crash, although they are not legally required to do so.
   Medical experts said alcohol would usually not show up in urine
samples taken two days after ingestion, although drugs such as
marijuana or cocaine probably would.

   Less than 1 percent of the 15,352 random drug
tests conducted on Transportation Department employees have turned
up drug use, according to a department report released Tuesday.
   Of the 15,352 tests conducted Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30,
1989, there were 99 positives for drug use, according to the
``Drug-Free Workplace Program Evaluation Report'' for September
1989, announced by Melissa J. Allen of the Transportation
Department.
   ``Marijuana use accounted for approximately two-thirds of
positives with cocaine accounting for all but a small percentage of
the rest,'' the report says.
   The total cost for the department's drug program in fiscal 1988,
which ended last Sept. 30, was over $4 million, covering
collection, laboratory testing, staff support and informational
services, according to the report.
   Federal Aviation Administration employees accounted for 95
percent of those tested under the random testing program which
focuses on safety and security personnel whose actions have a
direct and immediate impact on the public health and safety, the
protection of life and property, law enforcement or national
security.
   Of these so-called Category 1 employees, 65 percent are air
traffic controllers, 16 percent are electronic technicians, 4
percent are air traffic assistants, 3 percent are aviation safety
inspectors, and 12 percent hold other jobs.
   A total of 92 percent of supervisors and 72 percent of the
employees tested who were surveyed later by the department said
their individual privacy was protected during the specimen
collection process.
   However, comments on the questionnaire ``also spoke to isolated
instances where (specimen) collectors acted in an unprofessional
manner and employees felt the collection process was conducted in a
`degrading' manner,'' the report says, noting that Customs Service
employees who have been subjected to drug tests also have
criticized contractors conducting the tests.
   In addition to the widespread random testing, the department
also conducted reasonable suspicion testing, post-accident testing
and follow-up testing.
   There were only 17 reasonable suspicion tests department-wide
from Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30, 1989, and they resulted in
eight verified positives for drug use, according to the report.
   At the same time, there were 26 post-accident drug tests in the
FAA and two in the U.S. Coast Guard, and all were negative.
   In follow-up testing, 105 employees who had been identified as
using an illegal substance were subjected to a total of 659
follow-ups, and these tests found 26 verified positives, or
approximately 25 percent of the employees, the report says.
   Regarding the random testing, the report concludes that random
selection of employees has been accomplished, but ``many employees
do not appear to fully understand the random selection process and
therefore are skeptical of its validity. ... There seems to be an
impression that selection of specific individuals drives the random
selection process,''
   The report says the process selects facilities on a random basis
with names of employees also listed in random order, and that the
Departmental Drug Office was developing an informational videotape
to outline the process for employees.
   Drug program personnel, meanwhile, are questioning whether the
department could achieve the same level of deterrence with less
than a 50 percent annual random sample, and the report calls for
the drug office to assess what level of random testing would be
best.

   A noisy high school gymnasium is serving
as a shelter for a stream of refugees who fled hurricane-battered
St. Croix with little money or clothes and tales of destruction.
   More than 500 people have used the shelter since it was set up
Friday by the American Red Cross at Homestead Senior High School.
On Tuesday, 129 people remained, eating free food and resting on
cots while relief workers tried to contact friends or relatives
willing to take them in.
   ``We lost our house and we had nowhere to stay down there, and
with all the looting we had no money,'' said Ansylma John, 16, who
arrived with her mother and four younger siblings.
   ``We're looking for a house (in Florida). That's the main
thing,'' she said, keeping an eye on the children and a few
possessions stacked near their assigned cots.
   The Air Force has flown more than 1,000 people from the
Caribbean islands to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami since
Hurricane Hugo struck Sept. 17. Other planes brought survivors to
MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.
   Some children arrived alone, Red Cross officials said.
   ``We're trying to work with state officials to help the handful
of kids who have arrived unaccompanied,'' said Tom Donia, a
spokesman in Miami for the relief agency. ``We would pay for
transporting them to friends or relatives.''
   When Hugo slammed into the U.S. Virgin Islands, it destroyed or
damaged 97 percent of the homes on St. Croix before heading to the
U.S. mainland.
   Red Cross volunteers said most refugees want to return to St.
Croix, but several refugees said Tuesday the island had little to
offer them after being ravaged by the hurricane and the widespread
looting that followed.
   ``It looked like an A-bomb went off,'' said Daryl Barnes, 38, a
lawyer staying at the MacDill shelter who said looters took
advantage of the chaos. ``It was outrageous ... everything was out
of hand.''
   While children played tag or slept, parents told of plans to
rebuild their lives from scratch.
   ``I lose everything, my new refrigerator, my sofa, everything
gone,'' said Olga Melendez, 19, who watched her 2-year-old son
while her husband tried to reach an uncle in Tampa. ``Even my
wedding ring. It was in a jewelry box, gone.''

   Sand and signs sailed out with
Hurricane Hugo, but this resort city's brassy trademarks of goofy
golf and bright lights will shine ever brighter next year,
merchants vowed.
   ``Come spring, I think it will be just like it's been for 30
years,'' said Jerry Bailey, as he and co-owner Barry Robinson
cleaned up The Gold Chain Outlet on Ocean Boulevard.
   ``There'll be flashing lights and cars cruising with
good-looking girls looking for good-looking guys. It's not going to
change one bit,'' he said.
   Tourists converge on the Myrtle Beach area's 59 golf courses and
60 miles of beaches during the summer season, swelling the
population from 28,000 to as much as 300,000.
   But it's the city's dinosaur-inhabited miniature golf courses
and bright light boulevards that most people remember about Myrtle
Beach.
   ``We're tacky. But we're so tacky that people love us,'' boasted
Edward Waldorf, owner of the Fun Plaza arcade, restaurant and gift
shop. ``Nothing has changed. The show goes on.''
   Hurricane Hugo sent its worst fury farther south, but it still
swept to sea the city's $4.5 million renourishment project that saw
50,000 dump truck loads of sand spread around the central beach
area two years ago.
   ``We feel (the project) saved us,'' city spokesman Pat Dowling
said. ``Without it, we would have been in much worse shape.''
   As it is, the central oceanfront promenade is now a mess of
slanting slabs of concrete. All 110 wooden walkways that provide
public access to the beach were wiped out. Some stores facing the
open were battered into empty shells by the surging ocean.
   At least 15 hotels and homes were severely damaged, while all
other beachfront property sustained varying degrees of damage.
   But the city's landmarks remain, including the Pavilion arcade
and Gay Dolphin gift shop, which carries such specialties as
miniature roadsters, turkeys and landscapes made from sea shells.
   And, on Monday, several hotels and motels reopened. But the
beach remained off-limits because of contamination from backed up
sewers. A 7 p.m. curfew remained in effect.
   The Swamp Fox roller coaster still rises from a storm-battered
amusement park, and a plastic zebra and her two young remain near
an artificial cave at the Jungle Lagoon miniature golf course up
the road.
   ``It's still Myrtle Beach,'' Dowling said. ``We think that's
good in terms of the variety it implies.''
   Still, he acknowledges some people might say: ``Ah, damn it,
that stuff isn't gone yet.''

<HEAD>Rushdie Case Not an Isolated Incident, Writers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

   Salman Rushdie isn't the only writer living in an
Islamic community who faces threats, intimidation and de facto
censorship, the PEN international writers association said Tuesday.
   Alexander Blokh, PEN's international secretary, said a writer
with an Islamic background ``can be in a very free city ... and yet
he lives in a very permanent state of terror, discreet terror.''
   The association, holding its world congress in Toronto,
recommended its member chapters invite writers from the Islamic
community to discuss such situations, their causes and the means to
find a solution.
   ``We would ask them to come and very discreetly tell us their
story if they want to,'' Blokh said at a news conference.
   Blokh said PEN learned about such cases in Paris and London as
it prepared protests of the death sentence by Iran over the
bestselling novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which sent Rushdie into
hiding. The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Rushie's death
in February, saying Islam was slandered by the book.
   He said he also knew of one similar case of pressuring a writer
in Moscow.
   ``I'm not going to tell you any concrete cases because they are
still quite secret,'' Blokh said.
   He said only the Rushdie case was known to have ``official
status,'' issued by a government, but other incidents of
``religious fanaticism'' could be considered a new threat to
freedom of expression that had not been anticipated at the end of
the 20th century.
   The known cases consist of ``pressures, intimidation, sometimes
direct threats'' against Islamic writers in English and French,
Blokh said. He said the new form of censorship discovered only
recently was ``something for which we're not prepared.''
   The threats were coming not from a government but from a ``very
hard to define'' community, he said.
   The recommendation on intolerance and fanaticism, as translated
by The AP from a French copy, said the Rushdie incident ``is not
isolated and revealed many other pressures, happily less grave'' on
writers that may stem from diplomatic, family, community, religious
or terrorist sources.
   The PEN conference moves Wednesday to Montreal before concluding
Friday. It is the association's first meeting in North America
since a heavily publicized 1986 New York event.
   PEN, founded in 1921, has 11,000 members in more than 60
chapters organized along language lines. It is an international
association of poets, playrights, editors, essayists and novelists.

<HEAD>Mexican Attorney General Says Camarena Killers Will Get 150 Years</HEAD>

   The killers of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar each will be sentenced to an average of 150 years
in prison in the next two months, Mexico's attorney general said
Tuesday.
   Enrique Alvarez del Castillo conceded that numerous judicial
delays had occurred since Rafael Caro Quintero and 28 others were
convicted in the Camarena case, but said sentencing now was
expected in November.
   ``We Mexicans are convinced drug trafficking can only be beaten
through effective and energetic international action,'' he said in
a statement one week before President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
first official visit to the United States.
   With drug trafficking a major item on the U.S.-Mexico agenda,
Alvarez outlined Mexico's progress 10 months into Salinas' term.
Salinas is due to meet President Bush in Washington and speak
before Congress.
   Alvarez said more than 8,000 people have been arrested on drug
charges, almost 22 tons of cocaine base have been seized,
enforcement and training has been toughened, and laws have been
changed to increase prison time for narcotics violators and corrupt
officials.
   He said funds to investigate and prevent drug-related offenses
were increased 133 percent, to more than $50 million. He noted that
15 Mexican drug enforcement agents were killed on duty in the last
10 months.
   U.S. officials have praised the Salinas administration's
efforts. One official called last April's arrest of Miguel Felix
Gallardo, named as a drug kingpin, nothing less than a ``miracle.''
   The 1985 killing of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent who was working in Guadalajara, has been a
sensitive issue.
   Alvarez defended the Caro Quintero prosecution, saying it was a
complex case that involved numerous drug traffickers. In answer to
questions, he said sentences would ``average'' 150 years in prison
but gave no details.
   Camarena and his Mexican pilot were kidnapped on Feb. 7, 1985.
Their bodies, bearing signs of torture, were found a month later on
a ranch 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara.
   Alvarez said Mexico was working more closely than ever with the
United States on such issues as tracing laundered drug money and
drug lords' assets.
   However, he said allowing ``hot pursuit'' of suspected drug
traffickers' airplanes across the border was a ``stupid
discussion'' _ the United States would not permit such a violation
of sovereignty and neither would Mexico.
   Alvarez said Salinas ordered him to make a public report on the
administration's anti-drug efforts. He denied that Mexico was
putting on a ``show'' in advance of the meeting with Bush.
   ``This is not a `show' nor is there anything in the slightest
theatrical about this,'' said Castillo, who was sitting on a podium
surrounded by 6.3 tons of cocaine in thousands of white and brown
packages.
   The cocaine had been seized in the last two months, Alvarez
said, most of it along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Alvarez said he did not know if increased enforcement efforts
had reduced the flow of drugs to the United States.
   ``We only know how much we seize,'' Alvarez said. ``We don't
really know how much gets through.''
   Drug use in Mexico is still very low compared to the United
States, Alvarez said, but prevention and rehabilitation programs
are also being reinforced.
   Alvarez said it will be two or three months before the effect of
the crackdown on drug cartels by Colombia in the last month can be
known. He said there had not yet been any visible effect on the
amount of drugs in the pipeline.

<HEAD>Former Mexico Police Chief Sentenced for Arms Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Police Chief Arturo Durazo, who was
said to have made millions of dollars from extortion, smuggling and
drug dealing while in office, was sentenced to six years in jail
Tuesday on arms possession charges.
   Durazo, who served as Mexico City's police chief from 1976 to
1982, has already served five years in prison but still faces
sentencing on charges of fraud, smuggling and extortion.
   He fled Mexico after his friend and patron, President Jose Lopez
Portillo, left office. FBI agents arrested him in Puerto Rico in
1984, but he fought extradition for 1{ years while held by U.S.
authorities.
   He watched from behind a grill as Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco's
sentence of two years and a 2,000-peso (80 cent) fine on each of
three counts was read.
   ``I don't agree with this sentence,'' Durazo told reporters.
   He said he will appeal.
   Durazo was charged with illegally possessing 52 pistols but said
as police chief he had a right to keep weapons and some of the
weapons were replicas.
   Durazo was a childhood friend of Lopez Portillo's and became one
of Mexico's most powerful men when Lopez Portillo became president.
   He built mansions, one with a race track, and had 1,200 personal
employees. Some servants wore gold-trimmed uniforms. All were on
the police payroll.
   Among other charges, police officers allegedly had to pay Durazo
fees every two weeks to keep their jobs.
   He is now held up by members of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's administration as a prime example of the bad old days of
corruption in Mexico.
   All his houses, including those outside Ixtapa and Mexico City,
have been expropriated.

<HEAD>Shamir Says Acceptance of Egyptian Plan Equals Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday that
acceptance of the Egyptian peace plan would be tantamount to a
surrender to the Arab uprising.
   Shamir, in a speech in Jerusalem, said, ``There is no reason for
Israel to surrender and accept the intefadeh (uprising) as
victorious and the PLO as landlord over part of the land of Israel.
   ``What has been proposed to us today is to go to Cairo to talk
to the intefadeh leaders and the heads of the PLO about the
shortest path toward a Palestinian state,'' Shamir added.
   It was one of Shamir's harshest criticisms of Egypt's 10-point
peace plan, which has caused tension in Israel's coalition Cabinet
between Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning Labor
Party after Labor accepted it in principle.
   Labor head and Finance Minister Shimon Peres said Tuesday his
party ``thinks we now have a most important chance for advancing
the peace process. ... We should not miss this opportunity just
because some people think party considerations prevail over those
of state.''
   Meanwhile, Ehud Olmert, the Cabinet minister responsible for
Arab affairs, said Tuesday that Israel should consider imposing the
death penalty for security offenses in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Olmert told reporters in Jerusalem that he believed the
Palestinian uprising was continuing because ``the punishments
applied until now are not deterrent enough ... and therefore maybe
we should consider perhaps somewhat harsher punishment.''
   Asked what he would recommend, he said, ``Capital punishment.''
   Olmert also described Israeli prisons as ``too comfortable'' and
said ``hard labor might be one of the harsher conditions that
should be considered.''
   Also Tuesday, the body of a 30-year-old Palestinian was found in
the West Bank town of Nablus a day after he was kidnapped by masked
Arab youths, Palestinian reporters said.
   They said Hani Emil Salfiti, an ambulance driver, was apparently
strangled after being accused of being an informer for the Shin Bet
secret service, reporters said.
   The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating.
   Salfiti's death raised to 121 the number of Palestinians killed
by fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators with Israel since the
start of the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 574 Palestinians in
the revolt, and 40 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Meanwhile, four Arabs were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in
stone-throwing clashes with troops in Gaza, Arab hospitals reported.
   The army had no immediate reports of casualties in Gaza.
   A district court in the southern town of Beersheva on Tuesday
sentenced Shimon Efrakh, a Jewish settler from Neve Dekalim in
Gaza, to seven months in suspended sentence for shooting to death
an Arab girl.
   Intissar Atar, 17, was killed on Nov. 10, 1987 by an accidental
shot from Efrakh's pistol fired after Palestinian girls in the Gaza
Strip stoned a car in which Efrakh and other settlers traveled,
Israel radio said.
   The verdict pointed out that Efrakh had no intention of causing
death and that ``regular criminal punishment considerations could
not apply in this case.''
   The court also sentenced 22-year-old Ezad Mahmud Shabban of Gaza
to life in prison Tuesday for the Aug. 4 slayings of two fellow
Palestinian prisoners for allegedly collaborating with Israel.
   The Egyptian initiative advocates trading occupied territory for
peace and calls for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.
The Palestinian delegation would include two Arabs deported by
Israel to represent Palestinians in the diaspora.
   The United States has welcomed Egypt's initiative, designed to
sidestep Israeli objections to PLO participation in the talks.
Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist organization.
   Shamir has rejected any modification of Israel's own initiative,
which calls for Palestinian elections to select representatives for
talks on limited autonomy.
   Shamir's aide Avi Pazner denied that Shamir's rejection of the
proposed Cairo meeting contradicted earlier statements that he was
willing to meet with Palestinians to arrange elections.
   ``The prime minister has no problem meeting Palestinians,''
Pazner said. ``The issue is that Egypt's initiative wants us to
meet with PLO people.''
   The Polish-born Shamir, whose family died in the Holocaust,
compared suggestions that Israel talk with the PLO to Europe's
attempted appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
   ``They made great efforts to prevent a war with Germany and its
Nazi leadership,'' said Shamir. ``But the results were far worse
then the First World War. It seems that to us the lesson is clear.''

<HEAD>Wally Floody, Who Engineered Tunnel for `Great Escape,' Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wally Floody, whose tunneling expertise enabled
76 fellow Allied officers to break out of an ``escape-proof'' Nazi
POW camp _ portrayed in the film ``The Great Escape'' _ has died
after a lengthy illness. He was 71.
   Floody, a World War II Spitfire fighter pilot, died in a
hospital Monday.
   His son Brian reported, ``He had chronic lung disease, partially
due to the tunneling he did during the war. It only got severe
during the past several years.''
   A Royal Canadian Air Force officer, Floody was 23 when his plane
was shot down over France in 1941.
   He used his mining experience from Kirkland Lake, Ont., to
engineer and dig the 350-foot tunnel out of Stalag Luft III. Floody
designed the lighting, ventilation and electrical systems. It took
at least 400 prisoners to dig the tunnels.
   The camp, then holding about 1,500 captured officers, was
supposed to be escape-proof, but 126 prisoners broke out on March
24, 1944, and 76 escaped.
   Floody said the 50 who were recaptured were shot.
   Floody himself was not among those who made it to freedom. He
was transferred from the camp two weeks before the breakout.
   Of the 76 officers who fled the camp, only three eventually made
good their escape.
   Floody remarked in a 1986 interview, ``Every time I tell my wife
I might have been one of the prisoners who got away, she reminds
me: `Yes, but you might have been one of the ones they shot.'''
   He served as a technical adviser for the 1963 movie ``The Great
Escape,'' starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Charles Bronson.
   His son Brian said the presentation of his father in the film
``was sort of a composite role.''
   Brian noted that some people said that since the tunnel king was
played by Bronson, that must have been based on his father.
   ``Dad never said it specifically,'' he said.
   Floody often served as lead digger and passed buckets of gravel
back to the men working in the tunnels, which were named Tom, Dick
and Harry.
   The dirt was dumped surreptitiously into the camp's gardens.
   On several occasions, Floody was trapped in cave-ins and was
pulled out by his heels.
   The Germans found Tom. Dick was abandoned. Harry became the
escape route.
   Floody was a prisoner until the war ended. He returned to Canada
and began a business career in Toronto.
   Besides Brian, he leaves his wife, Elizabeth, and another son,
Michael.

<HEAD>Quebec Voters Show Support Still Lingers for Separatism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada must grapple again with tensions between
its English- and French-speaking populations after Quebec's
provincial election showed continued support for the separatist
Parti Quebecois.
   There also was a surprising vote in Monday's election for a new
Equality Party formed by English-speaking Canadians irate over
Quebec's language policies that favor French.
   Although Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa led his Liberal Party to
almost as large a majority as it won four years ago, it lost some
support to the revitalized Parti Quebecois and the Equality Party.
   The provincial assembly will have 92 Liberal deputies, 29 from
the Parti Quebecois and four from Equality.
   In the December 1985 election, the Liberals ousted the Parti
Quebecois, which had been in power for nine years, and won 99 of
the then-122 seats in the assembly.
   ``They said the idea (of an independent, French-speaking Quebec)
was dead; it is alive,'' a jubilant Jacques Parizeau said Monday
night. He led an internal Parti Quebecois struggle last year that
placed it back on a policy of eventual independence.
   Just months ago it appeared the Parti Quebecois faced extinction
but under Parizeau it won 40 percent of the popular vote Monday.
   The percentage was a slight increase from 1985 and was similar
to the vote in a 1980 referendum when the province's electorate
defeated the Parti Quebecois' policy of separatism.
   Parizeau won a seat in the Quebec assembly and is expected to be
a strong leader of the separatists.
   He calls for control to be gradually taken away from the federal
government over Quebec's family, language, cultural, social and
development policies with a provincial referendum to be held on
each issue.
   A constitution then would be drafted for Quebec and it would be
submitted to a vote.
   Parizeau has offered no timetable for his plan.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a native of Quebec and leader of
the Progressive Conservatives, told reporters in Ottawa Tuesday
that the Parti Quebecois has had steady support since the 1970s and
Monday's balloting didn't change that.
   He was asked if he was concerned and replied, ``The answer of
course is no, not at all.'' The Progressive Conservatives and
Liberals are Canada's largest political parties.
   About 81 percent of Quebec's 6.5 million people speak French
while English is the dominant language in the country's nine other
provinces.
   Bourassa said the election Monday was a ``truly decisive
victory'' for the Liberals and ``confirms the confidence of the
majority of Quebecers in the federal regime.''
   But the wins by the Equality Party will make it more difficult
for Bourassa to maneuver between the French- and English-speaking
sentiments in the province.
   Quebec's Liberals traditionally count on support from the
English-speaking minority and the Equality Party drew from that
source.
   In December, Bourassa refused to allow more than a token change
in provincial laws restricting commercial signs to the French
language. His compromise allowed bilingual signs only indoors with
the French-language portion significantly larger than the English.
   Robert Libman, leader of the Equality Party, was happy with
Monday's results and in a speech delivered in English and French he
said:
   ``A significant segment of Quebec's population who share a
vision of Canada and Quebec now have the political representation
that they need. The English and French must speak to one another.''

   The Senate passed two long-delayed spending
bills Tuesday as a 13-day partisan standoff began to ease, while
the House braced for a looming budget mess by approving legislation
to keep the government in business next month.
   On an 89-11 tally, the Senate approved a $14.4 billion foreign
aid measure for next year that would provide $45 million in
assistance to Poland's new non-communist government. It then voted
81-19 for a $157.4 billion bill for labor, health and education
programs containing slightly liberalized abortion rules.
   Across the Capitol, the House voted 274-152 to send the Senate a
bill pumping enough money to federal agencies to let them function
through Oct. 25. The vote came just five days before the start of
the new fiscal year.
   The Senate had completed debate on the two spending bills last
week. But votes on final approval were delayed while Democrats and
Republicans held private talks on rival proposals to beef up the
government's efforts against illegal drugs. Those negotiations
neared completion Tuesday.
   The assistance to Poland provided by the foreign aid measure far
exceeded the $10 million President Bush has proposed making
available. The measure would also boost U.S. military aid to El
Salvador by $5 million to $90 million.
   Under the eased abortion rules, women who are pregnant because
of rape or incest would qualify for federal aid to pay for
abortions, expanding the current criteria by which such assistance
is paid only when a mother's life is in danger.
   The bill would also withhold some federal aid from states that
do not require the notification of people whose spouses have AIDS.
   Both bills can't be sent to Bush for his signature until the
Senate and House work out resolve their different verswions of each.
   Final action on an $11.9 billion transportation bill was
withheld as party leaders work out final details of an anti-drug
package. Passage of a $67.2 billion measure for veterans, housing
and space programs was also postponed while lawmakers considered
bolstering it with aid for communities hit by Hurricane Hugo last
week.
   Congress has sent President Bush just one of the 13 annual
spending bills for the new fiscal year, even though they are
supposed to be completed by Oct. 1, the start of fiscal 1990.
   The rest of the measures have been slowed by Congress' earlier
distraction with the problems of former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, its work on an emergency spending bill for this year and
the question of how much money the government should spend battling
the drug problem.
   Missing deadlines for approval of spending bills is nothing new
for Congress. When lawmakers finished all 13 of the measures for
1989 one minute before midnight last Sept. 30, it was the first
time they had done so in 12 years.
   Because of that, during Tuesday's brief House debate on the
temporary spending bill, the ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts,
suggested a new version of ``Auld Lang Syne'' for the new federal
fiscal year.
   ``Should all deadlines be forgot and never met on time,'' Conte
told his colleagues.
   The temporary spending measure has the support of the Bush
administration. Lawmakers hope that by the time it expires, they
will have completed work on the remaining 12 spending measures.
   Here are the negative votes in the 89-11 passage of the foreign
aid bill: William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Alan
Dixon, D-Ill.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Earnest
Hollings, D-S.C.; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.: James McClure, R-Idaho;
William Roth, R-Del.; Steven Symms, R-Idaho and Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo.
   Here are the negative votes in the 81-19 passage of the labor,
health and education bill: Armstrong; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Kent
Conrad, D-N.D.; Dixon; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Garn; Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Helms;
Humphrey; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; McClure; Don
Nickles, R-Okla.; Roth; Symms; Wallop and John Warner, R-Va.

   Most automotive speed machines come in
colors other than passionate pink, but no one laughs when John
Mitchell arrives in his magenta Plymouth Valiant Duster.
   The 1970 Chrysler product, with a rare model of engine, may be
worth several times its price paid back in those days when a car
could be had for under $3,000.
   ``The paint name is magenta, nicknamed panther pink,'' said
Bruce Friar of Anderson, who helped Mitchell restore the original
sheen.
   ``We had to call (the manufacturer) and get the formula. They
only painted 12 originally, and being the kind of car it is, it's
extremely rare.''
   The number of these classic pink muscle cars yet remaining could
probably be counted on one hand. Mitchell says his, which has just
40,000 miles on it, may be the only one that's been completely
restored.
   ``A friend of mine (who) deals in high-performance cars said
that it's worth at least $15,000 to $20,000, and said if it's the
only one, you could probably name your price,'' Mitchell said.
   Not that it's for sale, said Mitchell, who has worked for
Chrysler Corp. in New Castle for 23 years.
   ``I'm probably going to hang onto it,'' he said. ``I'd hate to
get rid of something and not know what it's worth.''

   Roman Catholic Cardinal John Krol left St.
Agnes Hospital Tuesday, a week after surgery to remove fluid from
his brain.
   Krol, 78, left the hospital in good condition and good spirits,
according to St. Agnes spokesman Bob Gallagher.
   The retired archbishop of Philadelphia was admitted to St. Agnes
Hospital Sept. 19 and was transferred to Graduate Hospital that
night for the operation.
   On Saturday, he returned to St. Agnes Hospital, where his
personal physician, Dr. Joseph Gambescia, is on the staff.
   Gallagher said Krol's operation was very similar to one
performed recently on former President Reagan.
   Krol served as archibishop of Philadelphia from 1961 to 1988.

<TEXT>
   Police reported at least 40 people
were killed Tuesday in ethnic violence a day before a cease-fire
declared by the government in its battle with Sinhalese militants.
   The predominantly Sinhalese government declared a unilateral
cease-fire beginning Wednesday in central and southern Sri Lanka
but there has been no response from the People's Liberation Front.
The front was formed by militant Sinhalese who accuse the
government of granting too many concessions to the Tamil minority.
   Police and military officials said most of the 40 people killed
Tuesday were members or supporters of the People's Liberation Front.
   They said the bodies of 17 Sihnhalese militants were found in
two villages in Kandy, a district 55 miles northeast of Colombo,
and 13 bodies of Sinhalese were reported in several southern
hamlets.
   The Information Ministry reported security forces killed six
Sinhalese radicals in two incidents and blamed Sinhalese militants
in the deaths of four civilians. It also said 297 suspected
extremists had been arrested.
   Military helicopters on Tuesday dropped 200,000
Sinhalese-language leaflets, in areas where the People's Liberation
Front has been active, urging the militants to surrender.
   ``Take advantage of this opportunity and give yourself up,''
said the leaflets. ``You will be warmly received and will be fully
protected.''
   Most of Sri Lanka's Tamils live in northern and eastern zones of
the island and Tamil separatists began fighting six years ago for
their own homeland. The Sinhalese militants opened their revolt
against the government two years ago, accusing it of bowing to
Tamil demands.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of the
country's 16 million people and the predominantly Buddhist
Sinhalese 75 percent.
   More than 5,000 people, most of them government officials and
security personnel, have been killed in the Sinhalese uprising.
   At least 11,000 people have been killed in violence related to
the Tamil insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Gang-related fighting broke out among more
than 300 prison inmates Tuesday, and guards fired shots to break it
up, officials said. One inmate was killed and four others were
wounded.
   Altogether, more than 20 people were injured in the disturbance
at the maximum-security Menard Correctional Center, including two
guards, prison authorities said.
   The disturbance began in the dining hall and spread into the
South Cellhouse and the West Cellhouse of the century-old prison,
said Illinois Department of Corrections Director Michael Lane.
   ``The disturbance certainly was gang-related, and considering
the nature of the gangs here, it had definite racial overtones,''
Lane said.
   Lake said 21 inmates were injured, and eight were hospitalized,
most with stab wounds. One inmate was killed, said Lane, who
arrived at the scene shortly after the fight broke out around noon.
   Two staff members also suffered injuries, he said.
   Eric Freeburg, spokesman for Chester Memorial Hospital, said
later that nine inmates were brought to the hospital. Four had
gunshot wounds, he said.
   Lane said guards fired as many as 50 shots in breaking up the
disturbance, which involved from 300 to 325 of the 700 Menard
inmates who were out of their cells at the time.
   Most of the shots were warning shots fired into the air, Lane
said. He would not specify whether guards fired directly at
inmates. But prison spokesman Nic Howell said the slain inmate was
shot to death.
   He identified the dead inmate as James Bailey, 34, of Chicago,
who was serving time for two counts of attempted murder.
   Howell was asked if the guards killed the inmate and injured the
four others. ``We don't know that for a fact,'' he said. ``We would
presume (so).''
   Howell said authorities would investigate where the gunshots
came from. He noted, however, that prison officials hadn't
recovered any guns ``that were not to be there.''
   The prison in southern Illinois was locked down, and Howell said
everything was under control.
   Howell said the inmate population at Menard was 2,539 at the end
of last week. ``That's 74 percent more than the prison was designed
to hold,'' he said.

   A mother jailed for more than two years in a
bitter child custody dispute said Tuesday her daughter is fine and
she is proud of her.
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who was released from the District of
Columbia Jail on Monday, said her daughter Hilary ``is not only all
right she is more than all right.''
   ``Two years ago, she was a terrified, traumatized victim of
incest,'' Morgan said on WUSA-TV. ``Today she is a proud, happy
girl who knows she is worth protecting, and I am very proud of
her.''
   Morgan was jailed in August 1987 after she failed to produce
Hilary, now 7, for a supervised court-ordered visit with her
father, Dr. Eric Foretich. Morgan claims Foretich sexually abused
the child; Foretich has repeatedly denied the allegation.
   Morgan's release was the result of a law passed by Congress and
signed by President Bush last week limiting civil contempt jail
terms in the District of Columbia to 12 months. The law expires
after 18 months.
   Foretich, appearing Tuesday on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
program, said he was glad Morgan was out of jail.
   ``I only wish this could be coupled with some concern for my
missing daughter. I would have been in support of that bill if the
bill had a provision mandating a government agency such as the FBI
be required to find my daughter,'' Foretich said.
   Morgan has declined to reveal the girl's whereabouts.
   At a news conference late Monday, Morgan said that for the
immediate future, she would spend time with her fiance, federal
appeals court judge Paul R. Michel.
   ``I will go wherever my fiance takes me,'' Morgan said. When
Michel was asked about his plans for the couple, he only smiled and
shook his head.
   ``I'd rather not say,'' Michel said.
   Morgan said she wanted a thick steak, salad and a bottle of red
wine.
   ``Oh, I suppose I'll get my hair cut, my teeth cleaned, the
kinds of things I haven't been able to do for the past two years,''
she said. ``Beyond that, I cannot say.''
   Morgan credited a groundswell of grassroots support with
creating the climate for the drafting of the congressional
legislation that ultimately freed her.
   ``I am very happy, and very grateful, for those who backed me
and stayed with me,'' Morgan said. ``They made the difference.''

   Afghanistan's anti-communist guerrillas,
disappointed that U.S.-supplied munitions dwindled when Soviet
forces left their country, wonder if Americans have lost interest
in backing them to victory in their freedom struggle, a guerrilla
commander said Tuesday.
   ``I am sorry to say some kind of mistrust has arisen,''
Brigadier Rahmatullah Safi told a group of reporters. The feeling
now among the Afghan people and their guerrilla supporters is that
``Americans are very good people, but they leave you in the middle
of the road ... instead of showing friendship to the end.''
   ``The end of the road'' for the guerrillas and several million
Afghan refugees still waiting in neighboring countries will be
victory in the form of a legal Moslem government acceptable to the
people of Afghanistan to replace President Najibullah's communists
ruling in Kabul, he said.
   The interruption of U.S. ammunition and weapons supplies just as
the Soviets beefed up the Kremlin-installed Afghan government in
Kabul caused military setbacks and loss of confidence, but ``at the
moment there is no problem in the supply ... we are satisfied with
the continuation,'' said Safi, visiting Washington for talks with
U.S. officials.
   He is currently head of intelligence for the National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan, one of the more moderate of seven guerrilla
groups trying to achieve unity under the framework of the
U.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government. The U.S. government has said
it will back the interim government in efforts to oust the
Najibullah regime while also searching for a political solution.
   On early U.S. visits, while his homeland was still occupied by
the Red Army, ``we were met by Congressmen, rich people, who would
take you to their private homes, doctors for our wounded,'' he
recalled. Today, he said, ``there is still fighting in Afghanistan
... there are lots of wounded, but no doctors interested, no
hospitals.''
   As for Najibulla, ``he will not survive,'' said Safi.
   It was unrealistic, however, for U.S. officials to predict
Najibullah's quick collapse in Kabul, or seizure by the guerrillas
of the town of Jallalabad in Eastern Afghanistan, he said. ``It is
foolish to give a timetable. General Eisenhower, General Montgomery
never gave timetables,'' he said, naming successful U.S. and
British commanders of World War II.''

   Tap water became safe, some stores
reopened Tuesday and a ton of catfish was on the way to ease the
plight of this city's hurricane survivors, but 80 percent remained
without power and stricken outlying areas grew desperate.
   Generators and other necessities poured in to this historic port
from around the nation. The Mississippi Agriculture Department
arranged to send a ton of donated catfish along with cooks to fry
it and serve it with hush puppies, the region's beloved cornmeal
side dish.
   While Charleston regained some services, the picture was bleaker
in isolated areas.
   ``We have no ice, no lights and we're low on batteries,'' St.
Stephen Mayor Bobby Hoffman said. ``Everything is funneled to
Charleston, but we had a hurricane, too. People are desperate.
They're going to panic.''
   He said roads were still blocked by downed trees, making it
impossible to reach some people in the town of about 2,000
bordering the Francis Marion National Forest north of Charleston.
   ``We can't get to their houses to see even if they're still
alive or not,'' Hoffman said.
   Some other towns and the barrier islands had similar problems,
officials said.
   Hugo and its remnants killed at least 33 people in the Caribbean
and 28 on the U.S. mainland, including 17 in South Carolina.
   Charleston schools remained closed for at least another week;
some colleges in the area plan to open Monday. College football
fans at five southern universities were expected to donate canned
goods for the relief effort.
   Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic Tuesday, and
some traffic lights in Charleston and in nearby Mount Pleasant were
working. The Charleston Airport will open Thursday to commerical
airline flights.
   Residents climbed onto roofs to repair shingles under a sunny
sky, while others shopped in grocery stores opened for the first
time. Rain that was predicted held off.
   ``They're cleaning the trees out of the streets. We're going to
get along with help of the Lord,'' said John Gale, whose house
collapsed when Hurricane Hugo swept through South Carolina on
Thursday night and Friday morning.
   Power was restored to more than 100,000 people in the Carolinas,
but nearly 300,000 remained without service. It could be a month
before full service is restored.
   In Charlotte, N.C., Duke Power Co. said it had restored power to
about 75,000 customers out of 230,000 who lost it. The others,
including Duke Power Chairman Bill Lee and his family, may have to
wait up to two weeks, she said.
   Disaster assistance centers should be operating by Saturday in
four counties around Charlotte, said Joe Dean, North Carolina's
public safety secretary.
   Power and phone outages led the PTL bankruptcy trustee to speed
up plans to close Heritage USA, a 2,200-acre Christian theme park
in Fort Mill, S.C., that has been on the decline since the downfall
of evangelist Jim Bakker.
   In Charleston, where an estimated 50,000 people were still out
of their homes, lines for water and ice were shorter as more stores
opened and the city's water supply became potable.
   ``They're settling down today. Yesterday, they were kind of
pushy,'' said Walt Gilstrap at a Winn-Dixie supermarket in North
Charleston where workers distributed water and ice from
trailer-trucks to a steady line of people.
   One arrest was reported for price gouging. A tree-clearing
company told a homeowner it would cost $22,000 to clear a yard of
some trees, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
   About 650 Department of Defense personnel were being sent to
assist in the relief effort, while the Mormon Church shipped water,
food, cooking stoves, power generators, propane fuel and tools.
   The Fulton County Schools in Atlanta offered to open its
warehouse stacked with $4 million in supplies to schools damaged in
the storm.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell announced the state would hire some of the
estimated 224,000 workers displaced by the storm to help with
cleanup efforts.
   President Bush on Tuesday expanded his earlier disaster
declaration to include five more South Carolina counties, bringing
to 12 the number eligible for federal money in the state. Banks
began offering low-interest loans to those ineligible for federal
aid, including $1.35 billion in below-market rate loans from NCNB.
   Black community leaders met in Columbia to discuss how to
coordinate and spread relief efforts to rural areas.
   ``My people in McClellanville do not have water, they do not
have food, no clothes. There are those who are sick and who do not
have money to buy medicine,'' said the Rev. George Thomas, who
lives in the town of 500.
   In Sumter, the scene was ``very chaotic,'' the Rev. Frank Maddox
said.
   ``A number of people have been arrested for looting because of
hunger,'' he said. ``Many of the roads are still blocked. People
are hungry. We are in desperate need of a whole lot of help.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers began work on a temporary pontoon
bridge to link devastated Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island to
the mainland again, but the coastal resort of Garden City remained
closed and guarded by troops against looters. The bridge to the
Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island was wiped out by the storm.
   Boats continued Tuesday to ferry residents of those two barrier
islands to survey the damage to their homes. Residents were told to
wait at least another day before beginning cleanup efforts while
officials use helicopters to bring heavy equipment onto the island.
   Estimates of crop losses increased to $80 million to $90
million, and was expected to climb as more of the state's 5.3
million acres of cropland is surveyed, agricultural officials said.
Damage to the state's forests was placed at $1 billion, state
forestry officials said.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Tuesday condemned violence by national movements
and liberation struggles and said noble ends do not justify violent
means.
   He did not praise the Palestinian struggle against Israeli
occupation of captured Arab lands in his speech to the General
Assembly, and the message to the Palestine Liberation Organization
and other movements was unmistakable:
   ``Freedom must not be sought at the expense of others.
   ``No support or sympathy should be extended to the so-called
movements that allow actions humiliating other nations, or use
terrorist, barbaric and inhuman methods in waging their struggle.''
   It was the most explicit renunciation yet of violence by groups
which Moscow has supported in the past _ from those in Africa to
the Middle East.
   ``The time has come finally to realize that not all means are
good for attaining even the most noble ends ... The international
community condemns and outlaws terrorism.
   ``We need equally determined action against any kind of
violence, whatever the motives or excuses for it,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze did not discuss specific conflicts, but emphasized
the importance of international cooperation and moral behavior by
all nations and groups.
   He addressed condemnation of violence in his speech even before
disarmament and acceptance of President Bush's call to slash
chemical weapons stockpiles.
   Diplomats said it signified a greater Soviet commitment to live
up to its words about norms of international civilized behavior and
common human values.
   They also cited Soviet desire to improve relations with Israel
and to seek a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.
   ``Violence by the state against its own people must be ruled out
altogether,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Violence on national, ethnic or
religious grounds must no longer be tolerated.
   ``We advocate freedom of choice.
   ``However, we reject its interpretation as a license to use any
means, to commit any violence or to shed blood.''
   Shevardnadze admitted Moscow was disappointed by the setback of
the Polish Communist Party, but said, ``We are in no way
prejudiced'' against the new government, led by non-communists.
   ``We wish it every success and are ready to cooperate with it. .
.. We see nothing threatening in the fact that a coalition
government has been formed in accordance with the will of the
Polish people.''
   He said that if tolerance ``is mandatory for us in our attitude
toward the current government of Poland, why are others so
intolerant as regards, say, Cuba?''
   It was a clear reference to U.S. dislike of Cuban Communist
leader Fidel Castro.
   In his first address since he became Japan's foreign minister
last month, Taro Nakayama explained the new, activist foreign
policy of his government Tuesday, including a greater, non-military
role in U.N. peacekeeping worldwide.
   Nakayama also said Japan would welcome simultaneous or separate
U.N. membership for both South and North Korea and said Tokyo was
trying to improve its own relations with Pyongyang.
   He said Japan seeks to improve its relations with Moscow and
resolve the issue of the Soviet-occupied Northern Territories.
   Nakayama said ``recent events in China'' disturbed the Japanese,
a reference to the violent suppression of a student-led democracy
movement in June. But he said Japan expects China's policies of
reform and openness to remain unchanged.
   Nakayama announced that Japan is prepared to provide $600
million from 1990 to 1992 to help the poorest countries in
sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere restructure their economies.
   ``As Japan interacts with the rest of the world more intensively
and in a broader spectrum of fields,'' he said, ``it realizes that
it must play a more active role in international affairs.''

   ``The Cosby Show'' turned up the Nielsen
ratings heat with its sixth season premiere, taking its first No. 1
spot since February and pushing ``Roseanne'' into No. 2. ``Chicken
Soup'' showed signs of chilling.
   ``The Cosby Show,'' featuring the return of Lisa Bonet's
character Denise with a new husband and child in tow, had a 26.1
rating and 44 percent of the Thursday night audience for NBC.
``Cosby's'' last No. 1 rating was Feb. 27.
   NBC had six of the Top 10 shows, including returning veterans
``Cheers,'' ``The Golden Girls'' and ``Matlock.'' ABC had three
shows and CBS had one.
   Ratings are the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
with television sets in the United States. The share is the
percentage of sets in use.
   New shows in the Top 20 were a premiere of ``Hardball'' on NBC,
in 16th place, and CBS' ``Major Dad,'' which captured 20th place.
   A Bob Hope special dedicated to the late comedian Lucille Ball
on NBC was ranked 11th with a 19.3 rating.
   ``Roseanne,'' on ABC, captured a 24.7 rating and a 38 percent
share of the audience, according to figures released Monday by the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Comic Jackie Mason's ``Chicken Soup,'' after placing No. 2 in
the ratings last week behind ``Roseanne,'' fell to 14th place in
its second week. ``Chicken Soup'' follows ``Roseanne'' on Tuesday
night, but lost 6.3 rating points in the transition, with an 18.4
percent rating and 29 share.
   ``Chicken Soup'' played opposite a season premiere of
``Matlock'' on NBC and CBS' new series, ``Wolf.''
   A special Tuesday preview of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' producer
Steven Bochco's latest entry for ABC, tied with CBS' ``Murder She
Wrote'' for sixth place. The show about a teen-age doctor got a
20.7 rating and a 32 share of the audience. Its regular time slot
is Wednesday night, where it earned a 14.4 rating and 23 share for
33rd place.
   NBC also scored with its 15th anniversary show for ``Saturday
Night Live,'' broadcast in prime time Sunday night against ABC's
``The Preppie Murders.'' The ``Saturday Night'' special was No. 8,
while the movie about the slaying of a young socialite in Central
Park was 26th.
   The Top 10 shows and their ratings were: ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC, 26.1; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 24.7; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 24.1; ``Golden
Girls,'' NBC, 23.5; ``Sister Kate,'' NBC, 23; ``Murder, She
Wrote,'' CBS, 20.7; ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' ABC, 20.7; ``Saturday
Night Live 15th Anniversary Show,'' NBC, 20.3; ``Matlock,'' NBC,
19.6; and ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC, 19.5.
   New shows featuring television veterans did not grab top spots
with viewers. NBC's ``The Nutt House,'' starring Cloris Leachman
and Harvey Korman and produced by Mel Brooks, checked in at No. 24.
   ``Island Son,'' marking the return of Richard Chamberlain to
series television was in 42nd place for CBS. ``A Peaceable
Kingdom,'' starring onetime bionic woman Lindsay Wagner, was a
less-than-overpowering 65th place for CBS.
   Under network programming tactics, new shows are either
premiered or previewed _ the latter signifying a show broadcast
outside its assigned time slot. Some new series had two broadcasts
during the week.
   The highest ratings for other-new-show previews and premieres
for the week include ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' CBS, No. 22; ``Perfect
Strangers,'' ABC, No. 29; ``Free Spirit,'' ABC, No. 30; ``The
People Next Door,'' CBS, No. 31; ``Family Matters,'' ABC, No. 38;
``The Young Riders,'' ABC, No. 40; ``Baywatch,'' NBC, No. 48; ``Top
of the Hill,'' CBS, No. 55; ``Snoops,'' CBS, No. 57; ``Life Goes
On,'' ABC, No. 61; ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung,'' CBS, No.
72.
   Fox Network's ``Booker'' premiered in 77th place.
   CBS' ``48 Hours'' special on Hurricane Hugo was in 39th place.
   The nightly network news shows were ranked as follows: ``CBS
Evening News,'' in first place with an 11.2 rating; ``ABC World
News Tonight'' in second with 10.2; and ``NBC Nightly News'' in
third, also with a 10.2 rating. The ABC rating is based on four
nights due to satellite problems Wednesday. Nielsen Co. has told
ABC it will revise the numbers at a later date.
   The five lowest-rated network shows for the week were: ABC's
``Mission: Impossible,'' CBS' ``Wolf,'' CBS's ``Saturday Night with
Connie Chung,'' an ABC ``College Football Special, Michigan Vs.
UCLA,'' and an NBC ``Alf'' special.
   Overall, NBC continued first in the ratings for the 66th week in
a row, with 16.7 rating and a 28 percent share of the audience,
followed by ABC with a 13.1 rating and a 22 percent share. CBS was
third with an average weekly rating of 12.9 and a 22 share.

   A gunman robbed a bank Tuesday, fled with
four employees and later ran over two of them with his car, killing
one and injuring the other, police said.
   State police in Battle Creek said a man was arrested at a
roadblock later Tuesday and was being held for questioning.
Authorities recovered some cash and a weapon when the man was
arrested.
   Lt. Michael Johnson said a man wearing a hood met the employees
as they entered the First Federal Bank of Michigan branch in Perry
in central Michigan shortly before 9 a.m. When the vault opened,
the gunman took an undetermined amount of money. He forced four
employees to go with him when he fled in his auto.
   He returned minutes later and ordered three of the employees to
get into one of their cars and follow him, keeping one with him to
make sure the others followed, police said.
   After traveling about 30 miles, the two cars stopped north of
Battle Creek, drove a little father in one car and the man ordered
all four employees to lie side-by-side on the shoulder of the road.
He then tried to back his car over them, hitting two, the
lieutenant said. Two others ran.
   The gunman shot at them but missed, he said.
   The victim was identified as Marilyn Parks, 55, of Owosso. Betty
Green, of Perry, was in serious but stable condition at Lansing's
Ingham Medical Center, where she was transfered from a Charlotte
hospital, said Dr. Charles Gerwick.
   Two others were shaken up but not injured, said Johnson.
   Hal Helterhoff, agent in charge of the FBI in Michigan, said
possible charges against the man include bank robbery, abduction,
and murder.
   Police were alerted to the robbery by a customer who found the
bank's doors locked at 10 a.m.

   Motorists got so fed up with a reckless
driver that they took matters into their own hands, boxing in his
truck at a truckstop and holding him until police arrived.
   A tractor-trailer rig was weaving in and out of traffic Sunday
on the Adirondack Northway near the town of Chazy, tailgating and
nearly running some cars off the road, said Trooper Kevin Triller.
   After several miles, five motorists _ all strangers _ pulled
over, discussed the situation and decided to act, Triller said.
   One went to summon police while the other four sped northward
and caught up with the truck just south of the Canadian border.
   When the truck exited the highway and drove to a nearby
truckstop, the motorists boxed in the truck and kept the driver,
Rene Fortier, 31, of Mercier, Quebec, until police arrived and
arrested him.
   The motorists and their passengers, about 10 people in all, then
went to Champlain Town Court to file charges. Fortier pleaded
guilty to speeding and was fined $217, Triller said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An immigration official ``had a change of
heart'' Tuesday and decided to release on bond a 27-year-old
student from China who was detained when she arrived seeking
asylum, her attorney's office said.
   David Ilchert, regional director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, earlier ruled against bond for Hoy Yu Yi
after a doctor reported her to be in good health. But later Ilchert
``had a change of heart,'' said Hoy's spokesman, Bob Ryan. The
regional director is the only person who can approve bond in
immigration cases.
   Federal Immigration Judge Bernard Hornbach suggested the checkup
last week after a hearing in which Hoy appeared pale, grimaced and
said she was suffering from severe ulcerlike symptoms.
   Hoy and her fiance, Luo Jian Guang, 32, were taken into custody
Aug. 7 when they arrived in San Francisco saying they feared
reprisals for anti-government protests if they return to their
homeland. Immigration officials have the right to detain
asylum-seekers who arrive without visas or to release them on bond.
   While the INS said it has not taken a position on the asylum
request, the State Department has filed a report saying it does not
believe the students have proven they have a well-founded fear of
persecution if they go back to China.
   Their attorney, Eugene Wong of San Francisco, said he will
continue to fight deportation and pursue bond for Luo. He said Hoy
has relatives with whom they could stay.
   President Bush decided after the Beijing massacre in June to
allow the estimated 73,000 Chinese students in the United States to
remain even if their visas expired. But that decision did not
affect people who arrived later.
   Hoy and Luo were studying in Tokyo when they helped organize a
rally deploring the June 4 massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands
of people by government troops on their way to recapture Tiananmen
Square from pro-democracy students.
   They said Chinese Embassy officials in Tokyo took pictures of
them, and they received phone calls at home that threatened them
for their protest.
   Both students' fathers were jailed during the Cultural
Revolution in the '60s, and they testified last Friday that they
expect to be jailed if they return to China.

   The Democratic-controlled Senate on Tuesday
endorsed an additional cut of nearly $300 million in President
Bush's Star Wars program as part of a $288 billion military
spending bill.
   By a vote of 66-34, the Senate rejected an amendment that would
have restored that sum to Bush's Star Wars program to meet the $4.5
billion total approved by the chamber in its authorization bill
passed in August.
   Instead, the Senate accepted a total for the Strategic Defense
Initiative that falls about $900 million short of Bush's request
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The spending bill's total is about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billion
for the Pentagon's SDI program and $355 million for the Energy
Department and military construction.
   The Senate accepted those totals on a voice vote and continued
debate on the bill, which was expected to take several days.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the Armed Services
Committee who voted against restoring the $300 million, said
``there isn't any question'' that suport for SDI is ``extremely
weak'' in the Senate.
   Later, the Senate rejected, 71-29, an amendment that would have
cut $2.7 billion from Bush's request for $4.7 billion next year to
buy and test the first 13 models of the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Proponents of the bat-winged aircraft argued that a U.S.-Soviet
treaty reducing strategic arms would be impossible without the
plane. Opponents complained that the cost of $530 million for each
of 132 planned bombers was excessive.
   During a session that lasted late into the night, the Senate
approved by a vote of 65-34 a non-binding resolution calling on
Bush to report to Congress before April 1, 1990 on the U.S.
military's presence in South Korea. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., had
proposed a reduction of 3,000 in the 43,800 U.S. troops stationed
in the Asian nation, but the ``sense of Congress'' measure was
adopted instead.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate overwhelmingly endorsed shutting
down 86 military bases and scaling down five more, approving the
cost-saving plan to close bases. The vote was 86-14.
   The Senate totals for Star Wars are still far more than what was
approved by the House _ $3.1 billion _ and the House has not
compromised on the issue, according to one Senate negotiator.
   ``It's now clear that the House is not about to accept the
number that the authorizers agreed to in our bill,'' said Sen. Alan
Dixon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The defeated amendment, sponsored by Republican Sens. John
Warner of Virginia and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, also included a
series of changes to the bill approved by the Appropriations
Committee.
   Warner and Wallop would have restored $910 million for the
submarine-based, long-range Trident 2 nuclear issile, reduced funds
for the Apache helicopter and earmarked $395 million for
conventional weapons such as Stinger, TOW and HARM missiles.
   The defeated amendment also would have reduced the money for
fast transport ships from $1 billion to $20 million and provided
money for one rather than two icebreakers.
   On Star Wars, Wallop had argued that the increase in the
substitute amendment would have provided ``barely a minimum to
sustain confidence'' in the program.
   The House, according to Wallop, ``funded it at a level which it
cannot succeed. What they are doing to the American people is lying
to them.''
   But Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the amount for Star Wars
was a ``prudent position considering the current status of that
program.'' And Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., noted that the Soviets
this past weekend indicated that they were divorcing Star Wars from
any U.S.-Soviet treaty to reduce strategic arms.
   ``The Soviets are not so concerned about SDI anymore,'' Johnston
said.
   In other action, the Senate approved:
   _Transferring $135 million from the Defense Department to the
Energy Department for the restart of the three tritium reactors at
the Savannah River nuclear plant.
   _Providing $20 million in military assistance for Jordan. This
amendment was introduced at the request of Bush and approved by
voice vote.
   _Approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in the
Caribbean and United States damaged last week by Hurricane Hugo.
The total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available but
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the plan's sponsor, said that $50
million was for a Navy shipyard in Charleston and $25 million was
for Shaw Air Force Base.
   On base closings, the Senate approved an amendment that
effectively eliminates a provision that would have held up $300
million for the base closings until the General Accounting Office
certified that the savings exceeded the cost.
   A federal commission, in making its recommendation last
December, estimated a savings of $5.6 billion over 20 years. Then
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci accepted the panel's plan and
the House last spring upheld the proposal.
   The Senate action on the measure sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, came
despite appeals from a handful of members petitioning on behalf of
their home-state bases.
   Prior to the Senate action, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
further cuts in the defense budget by the Democratic-controlled
Congress may force him to close more bases.
   ``Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense
budget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close
additional bases,'' Cheney told reporters the day after Senate
Democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to
boost President Bush's anti-drug effort by $900 million. The plan
requires a cut of about $1.3 billion in the Pentagon budget.
   In te debate over base closings, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
argued that a mistake had been made and the provision simply asks
``that the comptroller general analyze.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., who has fought plans to close Chanute
Air Force Base near Rantoul, Ill., charged that the commission
``cooked the books.''
   Behind the scenes, the lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow
urged members to vote against the Nunn amendment. Picking up the
lobbyists tab of about $30,000 were residents and businesses near
Chanute Air Force Base, Ill.
   Voting against the base closings amendment were Sens. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan
Dixon, D-Ill.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.;
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Spark Matsunaga,
D-Hawaii; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Paul Simon,
D-Ill.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.

   Two other bombs exploded Monday, injuring one other person.
   Today, a Cabinet minister was to meet with representatives of
the country's 4,600 judges in an effort to head off a strike in
protest of what the judges call the government's failure to
adequately protect them from drug gangs.
   Colombian marines, army troops and national police patrolled

   President Bush wants a consensus on improving
schools at the education summit starting Wednesday _ not more funds
for a ``basically well-fed'' system _ but some governors say more
money is a key issue.
   ``I don't think you're going to find a consensus'' on the issue
of money, said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who chairs
the National Governors' Association.
   Bush and several key Republican governors are adamant that the
two days of discussions at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, Va., will not focus on more money for schools.
   ``The educational system is basically well-fed but it's
undernourished, and we must find innovative, accountable ways to
improve performance,'' the president told reporters at a recent
briefing.

   A physician, free after two years in jail for
refusing to let her daughter visit her former husband, says she
realizes she could wind up back behind bars in her bitter child
custody battle.
   ``I don't know that anything is over,'' Dr. Elizabeth Morgan
said shortly after she was released Monday from the District of
Columbia jail. ``I could be jailed again, and I know that, and my
daughter remains unprotected.''
   Morgan, 41, was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in
August 1987 after failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter Hilary
for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and
the girl's father. She has alleged that Foretich sexually abused
Hilary; Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges.
   Her release was the result of a law passed by Congress and
signed by President Bush last week limiting civil contempt jail
terms in the District of Columbia to 12 months. The law expires
after 18 months.

   A new appliance that can chill beer, keep ice
cream frozen and cook pizza has college students clamoring, and the
inventor, a former computer salesman, crossing his fingers.
   The Microfridge is a three-piece appliance comprised of a
compact refrigerator, a separate freezer compartment and a
mini-microwave. It retails for $429.
   The founders of Microfridge Inc. of suburban Sharon did more
than stack three appliances on top of one another and paint them
the same color, however. Their machine, which stands under 4-feet
tall, was invented to use no more power than a compact refrigerator.
   The first shipment of 1,700 Microfridges went out at the end of
August. The company plans two more shipments by the end of
November. Sales are expected to top $1.9 million this year.
   More than 88 percent of the first shipment was bought by
colleges and their students. And students are forming waiting lists
at Brown University in Rhode Island and the University of Southern
California.

   For everything there is a season, particularly
TV. For U.S. viewers, the season noisily began last week, full of
ceaseless drumbeating, store tie-ins and the newest twist, clips of
new shows on airline flights.
   That is a far cry from the way they do things overseas.
   An Associated Press survey of four nations _ Great Britain,
Japan, Mexico and Bahrain _ shows that the new TV seasons in three
of these countries make the U.S. version seem a September epic in
bloat.
   In the fourth, Mexico, there is no television season as such.
New programs are introduced on a seemingly random basis, with the
dominant entertainment form the ``telenovela,'' the Mexican soap
opera.
   Few shows are from north of the border, although viewers can and
do watch U.S. entertainment and news programs on cable.
   Depending on which networks they're watching, Japanese viewers
get two new TV seasons each year. One starts in early October, the
other on April 1.
   They also face season-starting fanfare for the programs, most of
which are domestically produced; few American shows air for long in
prime time and usually are consigned to late-night slots. Examples
of these include ``Night Rider,'' ``Airwolf'' and ``MacGyver.''
   As in the United States, new programs are played up in TV and
newspaper ads. And Japanese networks sometimes assemble stars of
new shows for variety or quiz shows that constitute a preview of
the coming season.
   But this hoopla is small in scale. It's nothing comparable to
the megabuck ``watch-us'' campaigns of the American networks.
   There is a fall TV season in Britain. But unlike the American
version, which began on Sept. 18, the British season starts
politely. There is no designated kickoff day, and there's none of
the massive promotion that attends the arrival of the new season in
the United States.
   American shows still are in the minority in this season's
British schedules, which still lean to the important and serious in
programs, or programmes, as they spell them there.
   No matter that one new British entry on BBC2, ``The Young
Ones,'' makes Fox Broadcasting's racy ``Married ... With Children''
seem like Noel Coward, according to some observers.
   You want serious? The BBC has on its fall schedule a show called
``Art in the Third Reich,'' while another outlet, Channel 4, the
most arty of Britain's channels, plans a six-hour version of ``The
Mahabhrarata,'' a dramatization of the Indian poem about the
creation of mankind.
   But not all is staid at the BBC. It has one homegrown attempt at
lowbrow this season, ``Challenge Anneka,'' in which the very blond
and enthusiastic Anneka Rice, clad in a jumpsuit, takes on
viewer-suggested challenges each week.
   And it has American shows. It's adding ``Spenser: For Hire'' and
``Police Squad'' to its fall roster, which already has ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey,'' ``She's the Sheriff' and, in the late night, the elderly
``The Jack Benny Show'' and ``The Honeymooners.''
   Channel 4's fall roster, like others in Britain, also has its
share of Yank shows, among them ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``Kate and
Allie,'' ``Happy Days,'' ``I Love Lucy,'' and the old ABC
miniseries, ``North and South.''
   There are four TV seasons in tiny Bahrain, where the government
runs two channels, one English-language, the other Arabic. The
seasons include one during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, when
the emphasis is on religious programming.
   But none of the four seasons start with any fanfare. In fact,
viewers have to make a determined effort to learn when and which
programs are on.
   There is plenty of Western programming fare, which has included
even CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' and HBO's campaign-trail spoof,
``Tanner '88.''
   But the most popular shows are prime-time soaps like ``Knots
Landing,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' and the most popular, ``Dynasty.''
However, all air without the steamy sex scenes to which American
viewers are accustomed.
   Because of religious law in Bahrain, these scenes are cut. Thus,
viewers may see a man and woman approaching each other, nostrils
flaring, then see them talking of other matters.
   There's an absence of soap opera on Bahrain TV now. Replacing
them in the current season is programming that mainly is geared to
school students.
   The soaps won't be back until the start of the next new TV
season _ in January.

<HEAD>Buying A Car _ A Real Shopping Experience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the beginning there were no sticker prices on
windows of new automobiles and the public was confused about
prices, so the federal government mandated stickers and people
became more confused.
   These people saw millions of look-alike cars on the highway but
they had difficulty finding two in the showroom with identical
stickers. That's because cars came with a myriad of options, and
the dealer might have added more.
   Those add-ons added up, and some of them were very peculiar,
sufficiently so to befuddle the potential buyer. To the
Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price were added charges that
included freight, preparation and even advertising.
   Well, the wary buyer thought, this is the way you do business in
cars and who am I to buck the system? But, he continued to wonder,
isn't that a bit peculiar? I don't buy my TVs, ovens, refrigerators
or even my house that way.
   The buyer discovered that many of the options weren't options at
all _ they were already on the car. And he discovered there were
more to come. After agreeing to buy the car he learned it wasn't
well equipped for the elements.
   That being so, the salesman advised the buyer to consider the
paint and internal protection package, rustproofing and an extended
warranty. Isn't it foolish, he was asked, to buy a new car and not
protect it?
   Then came the financing. The customer could finance through the
company or he could try for his own. The complications rose. Should
he take out a lower cost long-term loan or a higher cost short-term
loan?
   It was enough to confuse a computer, and the insurance was yet
to come. What to insure, who to insure, how much to insure? After
failing to comprehend his warranty, the buyer had no energy left to
read the insurance policy.
   Having gone through this maze a couple of times, however, the
potential car buyer felt a growing sense of mastery. It might have
taken a decade or so, but he had caught on to the ways and manners
of carmakers and their dealers.
   Then came below-market interest rates and rebates. Those prices
stamped to the car window, confusing to begin with, meant even less
now because cars weren't selling for those prices. You had a
choice: rebate or low interest.
   Well, it might have seemed that simple, but when you went to the
dealer you found that only certain cars were discounted and those
weren't the ones you wanted. And you found that the low, low
interest rates didn't apply uniformly.
   You went home to work it out. Which should I take, rebate or
low-interest loan? Which would leave me ahead of the game? Should I
finance through my bank or the company? Long-term or short-term?
Should I take out credit insurance to cover repayments on the
chance I might be injured?
   Wising to the ways of the marketplace, you loved to see
companies get into competition with each other, especially near the
end of the selling season, when they had to get rid of the old
inventory before introducing new models.
   Like now.
   You bided your time, worked out the figures in advance and
prepared yourself to pounce on the best deal available. After all,
you said, carmakers have already announced price increases for the
following year.
   Well, it's true, they did raise prices, but maybe they didn't
mean it. One of them, General Motors, already has announced
discounts from the higher prices on some of its new model-year cars
even before the selling season begins.
   This has produced a situation in which the new, higher-priced
cars might possibly be available at less than the prices pasted on
the older, lower-priced cars. Put that in your computer and see
what comes out.
   Right now, some analysts of the automotive industry think that
Chrysler and Ford will join GM in discounting, but of course each
company will have its own special formula for you to endlessly mix,
match and compare at your leisure.
   Nobody tries to look far into the future of anything economic
today, since the footing keeps shifting and distorting the
perspective. But you should be aware that if competition
intensifies the new terms might have to be revised.

<HEAD>Syrian Shellings Killed Millions of Fish off Christian Enclave</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts throughout to take in account that shelling has stopped
with recent cease-fire in Beirut. No Pickup.</HEAD>

   Six months of Syrian shellings have
killed millions of fish in the Mediterranean off this Christian
enclave near Beirut and threatened one of Lebanon's few natural
resources, a government ecologist says.
   The shellings stopped with the recent cease-fire in the battle
for Beirut but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of
local fishermen remain critical.
   ``Our sea is dying,'' ecologist Pierre Malichev of the Health
Ministry said in an interview. ``It's become rotten and polluted.
Our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next
year.''
   He estimated that along with the millions of fish killed,
billions of their eggs also perished.
   Malichev said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm
howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl, one
of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the
water.
   The shellings also forced most of the enclave's 500 fishermen to
remain ashore.
   But about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the
thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after
each shelling.
   ``After a heavy round of shelling, the dead fish float like a
carpet on the surface,'' fishermen Sirop Ornakian said before the
cease-fire took effect.
   ``We usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet. Most times
I collect about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of fish every trip.''
   The Syrians shelled the 28-mile coastal enclave and its waters
to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with
supplies for the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun in the battle
of Beirut.
   ``The shelling has killed our season,'' said Kivork Manoukian, a
fisherman for more than 40 years. ``Usually this time of the year
is the best for us, when we make some money. But this year's been
catastrophic.''
   His friend, Arten Khishkhishian, said he gave up fishing because
his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel
littering the shallow waters off Jounieh and the ancient port of
Byblos a few miles north.
   ``I've had to repair my net three times and that cost more than
100,000 pounds ($200),'' he said. ``I decided to stop this
`shrapnel fishing' until there's lasting peace.''
   But the others risked their lives and their boats, 15-foot craft
powered by outboard motors, to haul in the dead fish. Sometimes a
Syrian barrage would come unexpectedly. Police said several
fishermen were wounded.
   Kevork Manoukian said that on one night ``it looked quiet so I
dropped my net.''
   ``Then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my
boat,'' he said. ``I ditched my net and made it for the shore in
panic as more shells exploded around me.''
   Ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting.
   With fish in short supply in the enclave, the price has doubled
to the equivalent of about $4.50 a pound.
   Ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from
each trip _ the equivalent in Lebanese pounds of about $250 _ was
worth the chance.
   Moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off Beirut, where
the Syrians deployed batteries of long-range artillery along the
waterfront to shell the Christian coastline.
   But the Moslems are able to fish south of Beirut for 50 miles
down the coast to the ancient port of Tyre, where the biggest
danger they face is an occasional Israeli gunboat.

<HEAD>Ty Miller of ABC's `Young Riders' Went From Motorcycles to Horses</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ty Miller, who plays a character called ``The
Kid'' on ABC's ``The Young Riders,'' says that although he grew up
with horses he was more interested in motorcycles.
   He's in the saddle every day now for this new Western series
about the founding of the Pony Express. Miller plays the central
character of six young men in the show who sign up to carry the
mail from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento, Calif., in April 1860.
The show's original title was ``The Kid.''
   ``I ride but I don't ride very well,'' said Miller, who grew up
in Southern California in a family that ran a Christmas tree
business. ``We always had horses, but it's like when you have a
swimming pool and you spend your time at the beach. I spent more
time riding motorcycles than horses. We had 2{ acres and a stable.
The horse I rode is now 26 and can't be ridden anymore.''
   Miller and all the members of the cast were sent to cowboy camp
for a quick course in how to stay in the saddle. It was run by
Richard Lundin, head wrangler for the series.
   ``I'm finding you just have to get on a horse and ride and
ride,'' Miller said. ``It's not a textbook thing. In the pilot we
only used stunt men for a few shots. They did the dangerous falls.
We did all the flat-out riding.''
   Miller was more concerned with going to Tucson, Ariz., to film
in 100-degree weather in his leather costume. His character and
co-star Stephen Baldwin's character, William Cody, later to become
famous as Buffalo Bill, wear buckskin.
   This is the first Western for Miller, who appeared as bellhop
Eric LLoyd in the final season of ABC's ``Hotel.''
   ``My role on `Hotel' was pretty limited,'' he said. ``Mostly I
stood in the lobby and said, `Good morning, how are you? May I take
your bag?' Those of us who worked in the lobby weren't involved in
the main stories.''
   Miller acknowledges the ``The Young Riders'' series takes
license with the facts for dramatic reasons.
   ``They keep most of us around the station, more so than would
happen in real life,'' he said. ``That's for the sake of the
stories. We'll say there isn't a mail pouch to take out. I think
the riders spent more time on the road.''
   Pony Express riders usually averaged 75 miles, changing horses
at relay stations every 10 to 15 miles. Occasionally, a rider was
required to ride a longer distance. There were 80 riders to cover
1,966 miles in 10 days. The service ended in October 1861 with the
completion of the telegraph from coast to coast.
   ``Not one rider was killed and only one mail pouch was lost,''
Miller said.
   He describes his character in the series this way: ``The Kid is
very honest and trustworthy. He's the moral center of the group.
He's level-headed, kind of reserved. He doesn't act on impulse.
He's the natural leader of the riders.''
   Miller grew up in Los Angeles. His mother was an artist and his
father ran the Christmas tree business.
   ``My brother runs the business now,'' he said. ``It's the
largest Christmas tree retail business in the country. We sell two
million trees a year on 52 lots from San Diego to Sacramento.''
   Miller himself appeared headed for a business career when a
girlfriend at the University of California urged him to audition
for a commercial. He went to 40 auditions before he got his first
job, a silent part in a commercial for a canned ham. After that he
did guest roles on such shows as ``Growing Pains,'' ``Our House,''
``Valerie'' and ``Macgruder and Loud.''
   Miller was the last one cast in ``The Young Riders.'' He read
for the role five times and it was down to Miller and another actor
before he was approved.
   Like ``The Virginian,'' his character has no name. He's known
only as ``The Kid.''
   ``I'm thinking about what I'll do ... if it comes up that I have
to sign my name,'' he said. ``I guess I'll just put down an `X.'''

<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuddled in her father's arms,
3-year-old Masuma Khan emerged from the belly of a huge military
cargo plane and gingerly raised her deformed, web-like left hand
damaged when Soviet warplanes bombed her house in Afghanistan.
   Masuma, a shy child dressed in a native outfit, is among the
most recent group of Afghan war victims brought to the United
States for medical treatment under a program operated by the
Defense Department, private volunteers and doctors who donate their
time and expertise.
   After landing at this base outside Washington _ just minutes
before President Bush's Air Force One touched down on the same
tarmac _ Masuma and nine other Afghans were taken in a bus to the
base hospital. There, they sat on beds, intrigued by the small
television sets at the side.
   They spent one night at Andrews before scattering to hospitals
around the country.
   With her father, Abdullah, Masuma flew to Newark, N.J., where
doctors were to operate on her hand, which healed improperly after
it was burned in a fire at her house. She is expected to stay three
months before returning Pakistan.
   Other compatriots went to Chicago, Wilmington, Del., Columbia,
Ohio, Jamestown, N.Y., Baltimore, and Jacksonville, Fla.
   Said Mir, 22, who walks on crutches as the result of a gunshot
wound he suffered two years ago, might have to undergo a bone graft
in Flint, Mich., his destination. But simply arriving in the United
States buoyed his spirits.
   ``I feel nice,'' the Dari-speaking Mir said through an
interpreter as he sat down to a meal of chicken, potatoes and
carrots, served with plastic utensils that some refugees found
unnecessary.
   Since the Afghan airlift began in March 1986, 825 wounded
Afghans have been flown out of neighboring Pakistan for treatment
in the United States, Europe, Japan and Egypt. About half have come
to the United States.
   ``I think it's really been a successful program,'' said Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who worked on the legislation that set up
the program.
   The airlift works in conjunction with the Pentagon's use of
military transport planes to fly surplus goods into Pakistan for
delivery across the border to anti-communist rebels in Afghanistan.
   The planes deliver supplies and then, on their return, are
loaded with injured Afghans who are tended to by military medical
teams.
   Some $10 million was allocated to the Pentagon's humanitarian
office for the program in the 1989 fiscal year, an amount that is
expected to be duplicated in the coming year.
   The work of finding hospitals and families to care for the
wounded Afghans falls to the Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration, an international, non-political group that deals with
refugees. The group has a contract with the U.S. government to run
the Afghan program.
   Patients are carefully screened and must meet specific criteria.
They must be war-wounded Afghan refugees who cannot get the
treatment they need in Pakistan and who do not suffer from
communicable diseases. They generally need reconstructive or other
complicated surgery.
   Fran Sullivan, who handles the Afghan account at the commitee,
said hospitals in the United States sometimes use the Afghans as
``teaching cases'' because doctors don't often see the kinds of war
wounds suffered by the refugees.
   Typically, an Afghan receives up to $35,000 in free medical care
in the United States.
   To place the wounded at hospitals and in homes for their
rehabilitation, the committee seeks help from groups formed to
support the Afghan rebels and from members of Congress interested
in the issue. They include Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., and Charles Wilson, D-Texas.
   During convalescence, the Afghans stay with local residents,
often Moslems who understand their cultural needs such as dietary
rules against eating pork.
   The big problem facing the committee these days is the shortage
of hospitals agreeing to take the patients, Sullivan said. There
are roughly 450 Afghans in Pakistan who have been approved for the
program and are awaiting placement.
   One reason for the backlog is the decline in interest in the
Afghanistan issue in the United States, Sullivan said: Since the
Soviets withdrew their troops from Afghanistan last year, many
Americans say, ``Wait a minute. I thought that war was over.'' Now,
the U.S.-backed guerrillas are battling the Soviet-supported Afghan
government of Najibullah.
   Once they have been treated, some Afghans are not keen to return
to Pakistan, where they typically must rejoin the 3 million Afghans
in primitive refugee camps along the border. Their status, however,
is not changed by their stay in the United States.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``A Dry White Season''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando returns to the screen in ``A Dry White Season''
after a lamentable nine-year absence. The not-so-good news is that
he appears on the screen less than 10 minutes.
   Yes, he looks bulky, resembling Raymond Burr in his courtroom
robe. Yes, he affects a British accent (how he loves props) that
drew an initial titter from the preview audience. But no, the
Brando magnetism has not diminished in his long layoff. He remains
a dominating force.
   Like ``Cry Freedom'' and ``A World Apart,'' ``A Dry White
Season'' was filmed in Zimbabwe and looks at South Africa's
apartheid from a white viewpoint. The central figure is Donald
Sutherland, a teacher at an exclusive white boy's school. He is
vaguely unsettled by the signs of oppression all around him and by
the tacit agreement with the government's policy by his family and
fellow faculty members.
   Apartheid strikes close to Sutherland when his son's playmate
and the boy's father are kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the
Special Police. He enlists the help of the shadowy Zakes Mokae, a
taxi driver with good connections; Susan Sarandon, a liberal
reporter; and a noted defense lawyer, played by Brando.
   Sutherland's efforts to seek justice are thwarted, and he loses
his job, his wife, his standing in the white community and more.
Even his own daughter betrays him. Only one element of hope
remains: He has inculcated his young son with a sense of outrage at
the vicious repression of the South African regime.
   The sure-handed direction of Euzhan Palcy (``Sugar Cane Alley'')
and her talent for drawing the best from actors infuse ``A Dry
White Season'' with suspense despite the inevitability of the
outcome. She is superb at the handling of action scenes such as the
massacre of children at Soweto, focusing on individual human
tragedy. Her only annoying technique is the use of extreme
closeups, especially on minor characters.
   Sutherland is perfect as the rational man whose growing fury at
the regime's atrocities forces him to take action. Equally
effective are Janet Suzman as his icy, unsupportive wife; Susan
Sarandon as the fearless reporter; and Jurgen Prochnow (``Das
Boot''), as the embodiment of evil as the Special Police officer.
   The African actors bring substance and authenticity to the film,
especially Zakes Mokae as Sutherland's underground source, and
Winston Ntshona as the murdered boy's father. Both are South
African exiles who have brought the anti-apartheid message to the
London and New York theaters.
   In Brando's two scenes, he re-emphasizes his position as the
most exciting film actor of his time. Let's hope that his recent
announcement of another retirement was another Brando prank.
   The MGM-UA release was produced by Paula Weinstein and is rated
R for language and brutal action. Running time: 106 minutes.

   How much you enjoy the 1982 comedy ``Baby It's
You'' may depend on your appreciation of three alumni of New
Jersey's working class: Frank Sinatra, Bruce Springsteen and
director John Sayles.
   The year is 1967 and Jill Rosen (Rosanna Arquette) is a senior
at a Trenton high school, an aspiring actress from an upper-middle
class family who seeks acceptance to Sarah Lawrence College.
   She catches the attention of Albert ``Sheik'' Capadilupo, the
swaggering, sharply dressed garbage man's son who ranks ``Jesus
Christ, Frank Sinatra and me'' as the most important people in his
life.
   On the surface, another ``bad boy meets nice girl'' story. Sheik
gets Jill, Sheik loses Jill, Sheik wins her back. But ``Baby It's
You'' has much more to offer. With humor and intelligence, Sayles
touches on the conflicts of class and sex. What to do with choices,
too many and too few.
   Sayles (``Matewan,'' ``Eight Men Out'') collaborated on the
story with Amy Robinson, whose experiences were closer to Jill's.
   ``Certainly I could relate to both of them,'' Sayles said in a
recent phone interview. ``A lot of kids ended up in Vietnam or
working in a factory or married with kids right out of high school.
Your potential is cut off.''
   Rock 'n' roll, from the Trashmen to Procul Harem, is everywhere,
but Sinatra's ``Strangers in the Night'' frames this video. It's
heard three times: in a diner by the Jersey shore, at the high
school senior prom and at the Sarah Lawrence dance that closes the
film, with a bewildered pyschedelic band honoring the request of
Sheik and Jill.
   ``There's definitely a line running through,'' Sayles said.
``One of the fascinating things was looking at all the different
songs that came out around that time. Strawberry Alarm Clock,
Motown, the Rolling Stones. There were so many kinds of music.''
   Sinatra and Springsteen are Sheik's theme music. He glides
through high school to Springsteen's ``Hard to be a Saint in the
City,'' mouths Sinatra songs at a rundown Miami nightclub and races
up to Sarah Lawrence and a final reconciliation with Jill as
Springsteen grinds out ``Adam Raised a Cain.''
   Jill gets a little bit of everything, pouting like Diana Ross as
she mimes the Supremes' ``Stop in the Name of Love!,'' joining her
friends in a light-hearted chorus of ``Going to the Chapel'' and
walking arm-in-arm with Sheik to Ben E. King's ``Stand by Me.''
   The film's happy ending is possible only through an acceptance
of limits. Jill fails miserably in her attempt to impress her
sophisticated Sarah Lawrence friends; Sheik's Miami nightclub act
is a washout.
   ``He has to realize that he's not Frank Sinatra and she learns
to take a little control over reinventing herself,'' Sayles said.
   ``What's nice about `Baby It's You' is you get a chance to tell
about other people's stories. Amy and I were talking about how the
girls and guys in school always wanted to know what went on in the
other lockerroom. This gave each of us a chance to do that.''

   ``Lassus _ Missa Osculetur Me'' (Gimell) _ The Tallis Scholars,
directed by Peter Phillips.
   ``Lassus _ Masses and Motets'' (Nimbus) _ Christ Church (Oxford)
Cathedral Choir, directed by Stephen Darlington.
   
   It was after solving the case of the Bruce-Partington plans that
Sherlock Holmes completed his monograph on the Polyphonic Motets of
Lassus. Experts, according to Dr. Watson, rated it ``the last word
upon the subject.''
   It's unlikely that Lassus' motets will ever be exhausted. He
composed 700 or so, of which only a few dozen have been recorded,
in addition to his 60 settings of the Mass, 101 settings of the
Magnificat, plus hundreds of madrigals and chansons.
   Born in 1530, Lassus was perhaps the most popular composer of
his time. He not only wrote a lot of music, he wrote well, as two
new recordings prove.
   The choir of Christ Church Cathedral offers two Mass settings,
three motets and a madrigal.
   The Missa Venatorum, barely 10 minutes long, shows Lassus at his
most economical, the kind of music that might elevate the mind
without aggravating the knees.
   Technically, the Oxford choir cannot match the Tallis Scholars'
professional polish, but it is closer to the sound Lassus would
have known.
   The Missa Osculetur Me, recorded by the Tallis Scholars,
illustrates Lassus' frequent technique of musical parody. In this
case the Mass reworks his own motet set to the opening verses of
the Song of Solomon: ``Let him kiss me ....''
   The performances are ravishing, which is to say that they are up
to the Scholars' usual mark. Is it peevish, then, to complain that
the disc holds only 49 minutes of music? Encore, Mr. Phillips,
encore!

   ``Southside'' (Mercury) - Texas
   
   The Scottish band Texas lives about as far from its namesake as
one can get, but it has ambitions as large as the Lone Star state.
   Texas' new album, ``Southside,'' is one of the most promising
debuts of 1989. Texas shows a remarkable amount of maturity and
self-assuredness for such a young band, and what ``Southside''
lacks in originality it makes up in consistent quality.
   The quartet's sound, like so many other mainstream rockers these
days, is rooted in the acoustic guitar of frontwoman Sharleen
Spiteri. But it's augmented by the distinctive blues guitar of Ally
McErlane and the sort of throbbing bass that's more common to
synthesizer bands.
   Those ingredients are most evident on ``I Don't Want a Lover,''
this record's first single. That's not the best song on the album,
however. The vote here goes to ``Thrill Has Gone,'' an understated
country-flavored tune about the souring of a relationship.
   At times, McErlane's guitar and the wide open spaces of Texas'
sound bring the state to mind. Spiteri also understands well the
differences between singing and shouting.
   Her lyrics travel the traditional terrain of relationships with
neither great insight nor embarrassing simplicity.
   Texas sometimes follows the traditional tendency of young bands
to show their influences a little too openly. Texas obviously
listens to Bob Dylan, since the musical hook of ``Everyday Now''
vividly recalls ``I Shall Be Released.'' And the ringing guitars of
``Fool for Love'' sound a lot like U2.
   But this record is filled with strong melodies and performances.
There are no weak cuts, a track record that would make most young
bands _ as well as too many established ones _ envious.
   _ By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.

   The first exhibition to probe the artistic
dialogue between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque during the years
they collaborated on Cubism has opened at the Museum of Modern Art.
   It is perhaps the most important art event of the season, for
Cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with
the collective creativity of the two masters.
   ``We were like mountain climbers roped together,'' Braque
recalled.
   ``Almost every evening, either I went to Braque's studio or
Braque came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done
during the day,'' Picasso once said.
   Picasso and Braque pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a
pure abstraction. Through Cubism, which utilized cubes and other
geometric shapes to create forms, the two changed modern art.
   The exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both
Picasso (1881-1973) and Braque (1882-1963). The works are on loan
from collections in Moscow, Leningrad, Paris, London, Stockholm,
Prague and Basel, and were also taken from the Museum of Modern
Art's own collection.
   In addition to the Picasso-Braque exhibition, here is a list of

   The blond giant stood tentatively on the stage
of the Place des Artes theater, seemingly amazed at the standing
ovation accorded him by the packed audience.
   Max Von Sydow had come to the Montreal World Film Festival for a
tribute to his 30-year career that has brought distinction to
movies on both sides of the Atlantic. The program included clips
from two widely divergent films: Ingmar Bergman's ``The Virgin
Spring'' (1959) and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986).
   A dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the
Danish-made ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which drew the Motion Picture
Academy's best foreign-language film Oscar of 1988 as well as a
nomination as best actor for Von Sydow. He received a second
standing ovation when he left the stage.
   ``It's very strange,'' he admitted afterward. ``I don't know how
you feel, but I feel like I'm 25 inside. I don't feel that I have
any kind of `lifetime achievement.'''
   Film critics would argue with that. If he had appeared only in
the Bergman films, Von Sydow would have earned a place in movie
history. But he also has contributed a series of noteworthy
performances in a wide variety of films, from the profound (Jesus
Christ in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'') to the eerie (``The
Exorcist'') to the frivolous (Ming the Merciless in ``Flash
Gordon'').
   Like most successful actors, Von Sydow's career was the result
of a series of happy accidents. He was born 60 years ago in Lund,
Sweden, the son of a university professor and his wife. Max
happened to see some plays in nearby Malmo, prompting him to enroll
in dramatic classes at high school. After his two-year military
service, he enrolled in the Royal Academy, training ground for such
famous Swedes as Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman.
   Von Sydow played repertory at the Malmo Municipal Theater, where
Bergman had been hired as chief director. When Bergman filmed ``The
Seventh Seal,'' he chose the young actor as a returning Crusader.
The pair collaborated on 11 films.
   George Stevens was impressed with Von Sydow's strong, mystical
persona and cast him in the mammoth, unrealized ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told.'' ``Hawaii'' with Julie Andrews was also a
disappointment, but the two films established Von Sydow as an
international star. He has been working all over the world ever
since.
   Before leaving Montreal for a new film in Australia, Von Sydow
paused for an interview with The Associated Press:
   Q. You have now directed your first film, ``Katinka.'' How did
you like being on the other side of the camera?
   A. ``It was a great experience, very exciting. I had never had
any plans to become a director, but this was something very
special. It dealt with a novel I had found a long time ago; I fell
in love with it immediately and saw it as a film with me playing a
part in it.
   ``I tried to convince my director friends, but nobody caught on
to it. Then someone approached me to direct the film, and I
couldn't turn it down. I was too old to play one of the parts,
unfortunately. Time does these things to you. It was a great
experience, exhausting, but I learned a lot.''
   Q. At the tribute you mentioned that the first 20 years as an
actor were a kind of therapy for you. What did you mean?
   A. ``I have a feeling that many actors choose acting because
there's something they long for but cannot reach, that there's
something they cannot express in their private lives, that there's
a threshold they cannot pass.
   ``I was a very shy boy when I was a kid. I had difficulty to
communicate with people I didn't know. When I started acting in an
amateur group in high school, although I wasn't aware of it at the
time, I suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful. I was
allowed to express all kinds of strange things that I never dared
to express before. Now I could do it with the character as a
shield, as a defense, and as an excuse.
   ``I think that for many years I used my profession as some kind
of a mental therapy. I worked all the time, and I needed it. I was
restless, and I was very crazy if I was not allowed to work.
Through the years I have backed off. Life has helped me, and my
friends and my wife and my family. Today I don't need that therapy
anymore.''
   Q. The acting life has sent you all over the world. Did you
expect that when you started out?
   A. ``No, that happened later. It has its advantages and its
drawbacks. But that can be very exciting. I'm grateful because I've
seen so much of the world that I wouldn't have seen otherwise. But
sometimes you get a little too much of hotel rooms and suitcases
and packing and unpacking. I think I'll try to take it a little
easier in the future.
   ``I'm planning to do more theater, at least one production a
year, limited engagement.''
   Q. Where is home nowadays?
   A. ``My home is in Paris. Funny thing is that I haven't spent
much time there because I've been working elsewhere. We have an
apartment which I like very much. It's a wonderful old palace in
the old quarter of Paris. It's where Beaumarchais wrote `The
Marriage of Figaro.' It has been remodeled, and we have the attic
of the house.
   ``We also have a summer place in Sweden, and summer in Sweden is
very important. I guess I am more of a country boy than a city boy,
even though I grew up in a small town.''
   Q. Your world travels have caused separations from your family,
right?
   A. ``Not always, but for long periods. My wife comes along when
I go to places she thinks she will enjoy. It's not easy. But I have
a good wife, and we like each other very much. We have managed to
stay together.''

  Joseph E. Furey worked night and day covering all
surfaces in his apartment with painted cardboard hearts, bow ties,
stars and squares; small plaster birds; dried lima beans and peas;
clamshells from Coney Island; mussel and oyster shells; and pieces
of tile and glass.
   Heartbroken over the death of his wife, Lillian, Furey spent six
years creating a memorial for her with mementos he found.
   Then, with nearly 80,000 objects on every wall, ceiling,
cupboard and mirror, he left it all behind. He saw his work as an
obsession fulfilled.
   The Brooklyn Museum sees it now as art unpreserved, and is
taking steps to save Furey's creation.
   ``I was absolutely astonished when I first saw it,'' said
Barbara Head Millstein, the museum's associate curator of painting
and sculpture. ``It looked like a jeweled grotto.''
   The work was discovered last February after Vincent Kelley, a
real-estate developer, bought the building in which Furey had
lived. After entering Furey's apartment, he called the museum.
   Millstein hurried over. For the last few months, she has been
trying to persuade the borough of Brooklyn to buy the apartment and
preserve it on site. The lath walls and heavy plaster would crumble
if removed, she said.
   She said she will document the work with photographs and a
transcript of a lengthy interview with the 83-year-old Furey, once
an ironworker on the Golden Gate and the George Washington bridges.
   Furey, who moved out of the apartment nearly a year ago after it
was broken into twice, and now lives with his son, Joseph Jr., in
Chester, N.Y., is amused by all the attention. As for being an
artist, he's had no formal training, and the only museum he has
ever visited is the American Museum of Natural History.
   He spent 14 to 18 hours a day on his project from 1982 to 1988,
cutting out the cardboard figures of hearts, diamonds and bow ties
(made in honor of his friend Bow Tie George), and painting each one
in a planned color scheme _ but few people then thought his work
art.
   ``Most people looked at it, but they didn't see it,'' he said.
   Millstein said most people, including some members of Furey's
family, ``thought he was bananas.''
   But not now.
   His work is called obsessive or personal art, Millstein said,
adding that such art is rarely preserved.
   ``There's hasn't been enough encouragement to save it because
you can't take it to Christie's or Sotheby's and sell it,'' she
said of the noted auction houses in New York City. ``It can be, as
a matter of fact, quite ugly. It has more to do with obsession than
it does with beauty.''
   Furey's outpouring is in the same vein as Simon Rodia's Watts
Towers in Los Angeles, made out of concrete, seashells and broken
glass; Thomas Trapani's complex and decorative furniture, which he
made in his New Jersey home after his wife died in 1918; and
Korczak Ziolkowski's 35-year project of carving a Black Hills
mountain in South Dakota into a likeness of Sioux Indian leader
Crazy Horse _ a work his family has continued since his death in
1982.
   ``It's a private thing these people are doing. It's outside of
the main art world,'' said Jordan Davis, manager of the
Cleveland-based Spaces, a gallery that promotes site-specific art.
``Most of these people don't consider themselves artists. But they
are very creative people. ... You look at their work, and you say,
`Holy smokes!'''
   Millstein said Furey is ``one of a group of artists who spring
up all over the world, compulsively forced at some time in their
life to finish a project. They usually have some kind of trauma in
their life and they are driven to finish a project. A lot of them
are older people who have a last burst of artistic creativity.''
   Walking into Furey's apartment is like stepping into a miniature
museum that didn't put any of its collection in storage. The floor
is the only bare space.
   He started in the bathroom, moved to the living room, then the
kitchen, then the hallway, he said. He covered doors, both sides.
He pasted cutouts around the edges of mirrors, and for ceiling
work, he rigged up a scaffold.
   ``This is not slapdash, you know,'' Furey said. ``I would wake
up at two, three, or four o'clock in the morning and start making
cutouts. I'd paint them different colors and work for eight, or 10
or 12 hours. Then I'd take a nap in the recliner chair for a couple
of hours and start up again.''
   On the ceilings, he made rings around the light fixtures of
shells, bow tie-shaped cardboard cutouts and cardboard stars.
   In the hallway, he nailed cement-filled shells to the walls.
Some of the shells came from a neighborhood deli.
   A dining room wallpaper of a Western scene is partly covered
with the decoupage. Furey also pasted cows, poodles, chipmunks and
monkeys next to the wallpaper horses.
   Hearts are everywhere. Many are bright red. Many others are
black.
   ``The whole project was more or less to kill time and to get
over my grief of losing her,'' Furey said of his wife, who died in
1981. ``I had a lot of time on my hands, not much to do, and I
missed her.''
   Millstein said the objects represented different parts of
Furey's life, and many were for Lillian. The small birds, for
instance, represented the couple's peaceful life together.
   The two had married during the Depression and moved into the
apartment in the mid-1930s. They raised five children there.
   ``We had a good life together,'' Furey said.
   Furey's art reveals that it was, Millstein said.
   ``It's a five-room love story,'' she said.

   The King of the World. The Master of Disaster.
The Big Man. After more than 20 years in rock 'n' roll and almost
as many nicknames, Clarence Clemons prefers the simple tag, Mr. C.
   ``All those names, it's a heavy cross to bear,'' said Clemons,
the mightiest supporting star of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.
``I think about all that stuff, but `Mr. C' has evolved and he's
the guy who combines all these things.''
   Size, power and all-night parties are part of Mr. C. Personality
counts, too. As Clemons says, it takes someone special to play the
saxophone.
   ``You got to have an urban attitude, be a streetwise person,''
he said. ``I don't know whether the saxophone made me this kind of
person or if I was just born to play a saxophone. It's an extension
of yourself.
   ``Nobody played instruments in my family. My father got that bug
and said he wants his son to play saxophone. I wanted an electric
train for Christmas, but he got me a saxophone. I flipped out.''
   Clemons prides himself on being a survivor, staying around even
when music involved far more than the simple joy of playing the
sax. On tour now with Ringo Starr and a band that includes Joe
Walsh, Levon Helm and Rick Danko, Clemons is getting those old
feelings back.
   ``Every night when Levon Helm breaks into `The Weight,' I catch
myself,'' Clemons said of the Band's drummer. ``When Rick Danko
goes into his bass, I have flashbacks to when I was young and wild
and didn't understand a thing.
   ``You need to go back a little bit and remember how it was and
how screwed up it got. It was a wonderful time. This whole tour is
bringing back this stuff.''
   Clemons also reaches back on his third solo album, ``A Night
With Mr. C,'' which recalls a few other nicknames _ such as King,
as in King Curtis, whose sweet saxophone was featured on hits by
the Coasters, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin and many others; Clemons
covers Cooke's party classic ``Twistin' the Night Away.''
   ``King Curtis is my mentor,'' Clemons said. ``I try to pattern
myself after his style. He made a live record that's one of my
favorites. `Memphis Soul Stew' and `Soul Serenade' are two songs
that made me understand the kind of music I liked.''
   Junior Walker, Motown's hottest sax player of the '60s, is
acknowledged with Clemons' version of ``Shotgun.'' Clemons also
sings ``Quarter to Three,'' a hit for Gary ``U.S.'' Bonds, and does
a duet with pop star Kim Carnes on his own ``Dance, Dance, Dance.''
   ``Singing's one of the hardest things,'' Clemons said. ``It was
terrible, the first few times.
   ``I was so depressed I went into the house and didn't come out
for six months. That still looms in the back of my mind. I sang in
the church choir and was a great singer. I felt comfortable there.''
   On stage, Springsteen loves to remember the time he and E Street
guitarist Steve Van Zandt were on the boardwalk outside a New
Jersey club at four in the morning. Through wind and pouring rain,
a large man appeared, dressed in white, carrying a saxophone.
   That, Clemons agrees, is how he and ``The Boss'' first met, back
in the early '70s _ the short, skinny guitarist and his towering
sideman. Like Springsteen, Clemons has some stories to tell. There
was the time the E Street Band appeared on the same bill as rock
'n' roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``It was at the University of Maryland and we were Chuck Berry's
band,'' Clemons recalled. ``Ten minutes before the show, no Chuck
Berry. Five minutes later he walks in with his guitar, complains
about something, and sends it back. He comes back and we walk on
stage.
   ``The bass player (Garry Tallent) walks over to him and says,
`Hey, Chuck what are we going to play?' Chuck stops and says, `I
think we're going to play some Chuck Berry music.' We played the
whole set with no rehearsal, no nothing. He never told you the next
song.''
   The rest quickly became history. By 1975, critic Jon Landau had
dubbed Springsteen the ``future of rock 'n' roll,'' leading to
simultaneous covers on Time and Newsweek. ``Born to Run,''
featuring Clemons' blistering solo, was an instant rock anthem,
even gathering support as the official song of Springsteen's native
New Jersey.
   But business soon set in. Legal hassles delayed Springsteen's
``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' album. Harsh words were exchanged
all around. The simple joy of ``Rosalita'' and ``Thunder Road'' was
gone.
   ``That was the beginning of it, that was a sign,'' Clemons said.
``The handwriting was on the wall for a lot of people, not just
Springsteen. You look at the record companies and see the turnover
in personnel and wonder what is going on.''
   So Clemons chooses to look the other way, concentrating on his
music and getting by as best he can.
   ``I tell people to get out of the business, forget about it. If
you're not really, really special, forget about it. It's glamorous
and beautiful and at the same time, it ain't. You got to have faith
and you got to have a lot of luck.''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   As a child growing up in Massachusetts,
Jan Cohn was too smart to read The Saturday Evening Post.
   Now as a 56-year-old English professor and dean of faculty at
Trinity College, she's not only reading issues of the magazine she
ignored as a girl, she's also written a book about what she learned.
   ``When I was growing up, it was always there,'' recalled Cohn,
who graduated second in her Brookline high school class behind her
more famous classmate, Michael Dukakis. ``I, of course, never read
it because I was a great intellectual snob. I would hug my Kafka.
For my parents, it was part of their life, part of their
expectation.''
   Cohn's parents were in good company. The publication grew from a
book with no circulation, advertising or major writers to recommend
it, to a national magazine with a circulation of nearly 3 million
at its peak, Cohn said.
   When she finally got around to reading the magazine, it took her
10 years to get caught up. She spent most of that time holed up in
the Library of Congress, thumbing through 38 years worth of the
Post's weekly issues _ almost 2,000 magazines.
   The research led to ``Creating America'' (Curtis Publishing Co.,
$24.95). It's a 284-page book chronicling the magazine under George
Horace Lorimer, the editor who from 1899 to 1936 transformed the
Post from ``a cut-and-paste job of sentimental fiction and worse
poetry'' to one of America's great mass magazines, perhaps its
greatest, according to Cohn.
   More than creating a great magazine, though, Cohn says Lorimer
sought to shape a great America.
   ``The title (of the book) represents my idea that Lorimer was
quite consciously trying to create an America,'' she said in a
recent interview at her office at Trinity College. ``He was worried
about regionalism, about how you could bond all of this. I think
what he did, in effect, was a gradual shaping and consolidating of
the primary, deep movements of the American culture.''
   One of the first things Lorimer did as editor was to announce on
Dec. 30, 1899, the Post's plans for 1900.
   In a two-page advertisement, Lorimer asserted that the Post was
neither a local publication nor a news weekly, but a magazine whose
appeal is national.
   The ad proclaimed the Post would become the indespensible
magazine and went on to describe the average American.
   ``(He) is an omnivorous reader,'' the ad said. ``His range of
interests is wider than that of the citizen of any other country,
and so it is necessary for a magazine that will meet his needs to
be of the broadest scope possible.''
   The ad promised to deliver fiction to ``satisfy a healthy
appetite rather than attempt to create an abnormal one,'' as it
worked to secure the greatest living writers.
   Lorimer made good on his promise. By 1900, the magazine carried
stories by Joel Chandler Harris, Hamlin Garland, Bret Harte,
Rebecca Harding Davis and Paul Laurence Dunbar.
   ``He genuinely wanted the best in fiction as he judged it, and
he set out to get it by providing much more favorable terms than
any other magazine offered,'' Cohn writes in ``Creating America.''
   ``The Post guaranteed to read stories within 72 hours of receipt
and to pay on acceptance rather than on publication.
Understandably, these policies paid off handsomely.''
   Eventually, the Post would publish fiction by such writers as F.
Scott Fitzgerald, Frank Norris and J.P. Marquand, and dispatches
from around the world by Irving Cobb, Sam Blythe, Bill Irwin and
Mary Roberts Rinehart, who reported from the front during World War
I.
   Its covers would feature the work of Harrison Fisher and Norman
Rockwell, who once declined an offer by a competing magazine to
double the price for his work out of loyalty to Lorimer and his
magazine.
   Not everything about Lorimer was golden, however.
   Although he was a patriot, Lorimer thought getting involved in
World War I was a disaster, and afterwards he became conservative
and opposed any kind of progressive social movement, Cohn said.
   The magazine suffered, becoming less interesting, but everyone
still loved it because it was the Post, she said.
   Then in the 1930s Lorimer came to life again, devoting the last
four years of his editorship to essentially running against
Franklin D. Roosevelt. When Roosevelt won, Lorimer resigned and
died a year later.
   ``As much as I'm personally opposed to the politicis (of the
Post) in the 1930s, it's full of energy _ not just the fiction, but
the nonfiction,'' Cohn said.
   Cohn, who teaches a class in popular literature at Trinity using
Harlequin romances, Westerns and comic strips, said there are no
modern-day equivalents to the Post or its editor.
   ``There was a time when Edward R. Murrow or Walter Cronkite
commanded the same authority, although the medium makes it
different,'' she said. ``Even though Lorimer was a celebrity, he
was invisible. You never saw his name, except in the last editorial
he wrote. It isn't Lorimer you could think of as an Edward R.
Murrow. It was the magazine.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Roger Whittaker Is a Sales Wonder</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY1 of Sept. 25</HEAD>

   Roger Whittaker is a sales wonder. In 25
years, he has recorded 43 albums and sold 30 million LPs worldwide.
   One single record alone, ``The Last Farewell'' in 1978, sold 11
million copies.
   ``It's staggering, astonishing,'' said the 53-year-old Whittaker
in a telephone interview from Germany. ``I face it as it comes
along. It's great to know you can do it. If you think about it, you
get a swelled head.''
   His top-selling albums in the United States are ``The Best of
Roger Whittaker'' and ``All My Best,'' both nearing sales of 1
million. Many of his records are sold through TV marketing,
including ``Best Loved Ballads'' and ``All Time Heart-Touching
Favorites.''
   He has just released for over-the-counter sale another album,
``I'd Fall in Love Tonight,'' produced in Nashville. It includes
country music standards like ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,''
``There Goes My Everything'' and ``Have I Told You Lately That I
Love You.''
   The singer-songwriter-guitarist now records for Universal
Records after 19 years and 19 albums with RCA. Singing in three
languages _ English, French and Spanish _ has widened his appeal.
   Whittaker also has gained a larger audience through hawking his
albums on TV. Universal Records thinks he's someone who can get
consumers to buy records at the retail level rather than just
picking up the phone and dialing the number shown on the TV screen.
   ``We're looking forward to adding to our collection of gold and
platinum albums,'' said Jimmy Bowen, Universal president.
   Whittaker is a star in North America, Europe, Australia and
various points in between. One Nashville record store recently had
four different Whittaker albums and five different compact discs.
   ``I can go anywhere,'' he said. ``It's a wonderful feeling. I've
made 10 tours of Canada. We did better business on this 10th tour
than any one we've done.''
   Singing love ballads and not making drastic changes in style
have helped him do well, he said.
   ``I've stayed in the style and never tried to conform to
convention. I've sung the kind of songs I write even when out of
vogue. Fifteen percent of the record-buying public buy my kind of
music. I've stayed faithful to that core of people.
   ``Every once in a while a song comes along that every one takes
to, like `The Last Farewell,''' he said.
   He described ``The Last Farewell'' as ``a happy marriage of
lyrics and melody.''
   ``It was number one in places like Finland where they don't
speak English,'' said Whittaker. ``They still play it in Russia, so
the tune must have a lot to do with its success. The
English-speaking nations identified with the chorus, `For you are
beautiful and I love you dearly.'
   ``The lyrics were emotive to me and I identified with them.''
   In his writing and singing, Whittaker looks for songs that
express realism.
   ``If I can relate to what a person is saying, then I sing it.
Like `Downtown' or `The Last Farewell.' If it reflects something of
my own experience, then I sing it.''
   Whittaker, born in Nairobi, Kenya, now lives in London. He has a
degree in biochemistry from the University of Bangor in Wales.
   ``I did become a biochemist,'' he said. ``But I wanted to go
into the entertainment business to get it out of my system. The
more I got into it, the more I fought to succeed.
   ``The less I succeeded, the more I fought,'' he said. ``It
became a real mania for me. My father threatened me about getting
the right job. When I finally found success, he came around a bit.''
   Apart from his recording and concert tours, his TV special,
``Roger Whittaker in Kenya, a Musical Safari,'' was shown by the
British Broadcasting Corp., and in the United States by the Disney
Channel on cable TV.
   He is active in efforts to help save Africa's black rhino,
donating proceeds from program sales at concerts and recording
royalties to a trust fund to create sanctuaries for the rhino in
Kenya.

<HEAD>Sales Up Based on GM Results, But For How Long?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks rose
12.7 percent in mid-September, based on a strong showing by General
Motors Corp., but at least one analyst wondered how long it could
go on.
   The eight major U.S. automakers said Monday they sold cars and
light trucks at an average daily rate of 37,948 during the Sept.
11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 33,670 during the
same time last year.
   GM buyers propelled the company's truck sales up 46 percent and
car sales by 11.2 percent. Combined, GM's vehicle sales were up
21.7 percent during the period this year over last year.
   ``They had incentives that were closing, that had been scheduled
to end this week and a lot of dealer incentives,'' said analyst Ron
Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   The dealer incentives, which manufacturers give to their
retailers to use as they please, have helped move cars and trucks,
said Bill Meier, general manager of Ray Green Chevrolet in
Jacksonville, Ill.
   ``I think, finally, they realized that when you put the money in
the dealers' pockets, they're going to sell them,'' he said of the
cars on his lot. Meier said an inventory of 35 1989 model vehicles
on his lot at the beginning of the month had shrunk to eight by
Monday.
   ``They (dealers) asked us to give them money so they could sell
in their marketplace,'' said GM spokesman Terry Sullivan. ``At
least in the first 20 days (of September), they're proving that may
have made some sense.
   ``We're just having a very strong September,'' he said.
   But Glantz and other analysts have said for weeks that the boom
that has gone on during the past several sales periods may stem
from incentives and reports of price increases on 1990 models that
are pushing consumers into buy-now thinking.
   ``The industry has an above average amount of inventory, there
are unprecedented incentives and a whopping price increase for the
1990s,'' Glantz said. ``(Sales) are going to fall off a cliff in
October.''
   So far this year, car and truck sales by the eight manufacturers
are down 1.5 percent compared to the same 1988 period. A 0.4
percent increase in truck sales was more than offset by a 2.6
percent decline in car sales.
   GM and Chrysler Corp. already have begun offering incentives on
their 1990 models, sometimes even before the vehicles officially go
on sale. Ford Motor Co. is expected to jump into the incentive fray.
   Dealers have worried that consumers are getting so conditioned
to incentives that cars and trucks must have them in order to be
attractive. Meier was bullish on the future of the industry.
   ``The (1990) price increases are one thing, but when people come
out and see what they are getting and with the incentives, there
isn't that much different,'' he said.
   Ford said sales of its cars and light trucks were up 3.4 percent
in mid-September over last year. Car sales were up 2.6 percent and
truck sales rose 4.5 percent. For the year, Ford's vehicle sales
were down 0.7 percent.
   Car and truck sales at Chrysler were up 0.7 percent in
mid-September. Car sales were up 2.1 percent and truck sales were
down 0.7 percent. For the year, vehicle sales at Chrysler were
running 5.9 percent behind last year's pace.
   For the year, GM has sold 3.9 percent fewer vehicles than it did
through Sept. 20, 1988.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for second period of September 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 221 selling days so far this year,
compared with 222 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit eased to $3.69
billion in August from a revised shortfall of $3.99 billion the
previous month, but it was still the fourth-largest gap ever, the
government said Tuesday.
   The Central Statistical Office said the deficit of the current
account, which includes services and overseas investments, was
$3.20 billion, the third largest ever, but down from July's revised
deficit of $3.50 billion.
   The pound and stock prices fell sharply on the news.
   The government said August's figures, like that of the previous
month's, could have been distorted by a three-week strike by dock
workers at some British ports which disrupted trade flows this
summer.
   Exports totaled $12.04 billion in August, down from $12.39
billion in July and up from $11.01 billion dollars) in August 1988.
   Imports totaled $15.72 billion in August, down from $16.40
billion in July and up from $13.68 billion in August 1988.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade balance
has been in deficit by $26.79 billion, compared with a deficit of
$20.73 billion a year earlier.
   The current account has been in deficit by $22.33 billion so far
this year, compared with a gap of $13.74 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T To Buy Istel for $290 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. announced
Tuesday it plans to buy Istel Group Ltd., a British information
technology company, for $290 million in cash.
   The acquisition represents AT&amp;T's first major purchase in
Britain and would strengthen the company's presence in the
information movement and management industry in Europe.
   ``We think Istel can support AT&amp;T in important ways as AT&amp;T
seeks to become a more global player,'' John Berndt, president of
AT&amp;T International Communications Services, told a news conference.
``We are trying to expand our capabilities outside the United
States.''
   The offer price varies for each class of Istel shares.
   The board of directors of the British-based data networking
company recommended that its shareholders take up AT&amp;T's offer and
said shareholders who own 53.7 percent of Istel's outstanding
shares already have agreed to accept the bid.
   Rover Group, a unit of British Aerospace PLC, said it would sell
its minority shareholding of 21.7 percent in Istel to AT&amp;T once the
American telecommunications company obtains a majority stake.
   Under the terms of the offer, Istel would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of AT&amp;T with no change in its name or management.
   ``We think it's a tremendous step forward,'' said John
Leighfield, Istel's chairman.
   He said his company was motivated to find a partner by
widespread consolidation in the telecommunications industry, which
meant, ``we'd have formidable competitors in the mid-1990s.''
   ``We wanted to put Istel in the best position to fulfill its
potential to the maximum,'' Leighfield said.
   Istel, which is based in Redditch in the English Midlands and
employs 1,800 people, is a leading British supplier of information
technology and services and is known for its systems integration
skills. It operates in a variety of markets, including automotive,
financial services, health care, manufacturing, travel, leisure,
retail and distribution.
   Istel had pre-tax profit of $14 million on revenue of $134
million last year.
   AT&amp;T has a transmissions systems development and manufacturing
facility in western England, employing 500 people. Its European
software operation is based in London.

   Congress is taking aim at alleged
price-gouging among a new crop of telephone companies that serve
the traveling public.
   The House, on a voice vote Monday, passed a bill that would
regulate prices and require extensive disclosure to callers using
any of the more than 35 alternative-operator companies which have
sprung up in the wake of the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   The bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the industry's charges and determine if such companies
dominate the market enough to require regulation. A companion bill
is pending in the Senate.
   The companies would have to file their prices with the FCC
within 30 days and, if the commission finds them ``unjust or
unreasonable,'' the companies would have to justify the rates,
which can be far greater than the fees for similar calls from
customers' homes.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said the legislation was
designed to ``protect consumers from price-gouging'' by ``fast-buck
artists'' without jeopardizing the future of the operator services
industry.
   One caller told the FCC he was charged $27.53 for a 27-minute
call from a Florida hotel to Connecticut using an AT&amp;T calling
card. AT&amp;T would have normally charged $4.60.
   The measure also would order the FCC to extend to the entire
operator services industry disclosure requirements imposed on five
of the companies in February.
   There are more than 35 operator services companies in the United
States providing approximately 5 percent of the $12 billion market
for ``dial-0'' services such as credit card, third party billing
and collect calls.
   The FCC does not regulate these companies' rates because the
commission says they don't dominate the market.
   But critics say they do dominate in places, such as schools,
hotels and airports, where they often control all long-distance
calls.

<TEXT>
   Consumer, labor and government watchdog groups
announced today their opposition to President Bush's plan to cut
the capital gains tax, saying it would be a windfall for
high-income taxpayers.
   ``Capital gains proponents are asking Americans to ignore the
unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to
individuals who need it the least,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
president of Common Cause, a self-styled citizens lobby involved in
government ethics isssues.
   ``Congress is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing
wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over
$200,000 won't cure,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a Ralph Nader organization.
   ``The vote is a critical test of whether the Congress is truly a
representative body _ or whether it is a captive of big money
lobbyists and the wealthy,'' she said. That vote could come as
early as Wednesday.
   ``If Congress approves of this new tax break, members of
Congress may find it hard to explain to working people back home
why they voted for yet another bargain with high-income
taxpayers,'' said a statement by the Friends Committee on National
Legislation, a Quaker group.
   The groups held a news conference in the Capitol as the battle
over the capital gains tax moved to the airwaves, with Republicans
and Democrats advertising for popular support on an issue that is
dividing Congress sharply along partisan lines.
   ``George Bush wants to raid the Treasury by reducing capital
gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working Americans to pay
for it,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., argues in
a television spot produced by the Democratic National Committee.
   ``Why are foreign economies growing faster than the U.S.? One
big reason is taxes,'' says a Republican ad that pictures an
American flag slipping behind flags from Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
``We have one of the world's highest capital gains taxes,'' it
says, while the comparable taxes in those other countries are
miniscule.
   The parties were buying time for the ads in Washington, where
the target will be the votes of a few mostly conservative Democrats
who could decide the outcome when the House votes. It is the
biggest test for the new House Democratic leadership under Speaker
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and for a Republican strategy that
seeks to weaken the majority leadership by courting conservative
Democrats.
   The Republicans say Democrats, by fighting the Bush-supported
plan to cut the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6
percent over the next 27 months, are attached to a ``tax and
spend'' philosophy.
   The Democratic alternative would raise marginal tax rates on the
wealthy to the same 33 percent paid in the bracket that covers the
upper-middle-income. That revenue would then be used to restore tax
breaks for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The Democratic plan also includes a capital gains cut _ to 28
percent, so it would not cut the marginal rate paid by the most
wealthy.
   ``It's clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes,''
Bush's budget director Richard Darman said Monday. ``Who's going to
believe they want to stop there?''
   Foley denounced Darman's comments as ``stuff and nonsense.''
   The Democrats oppose the Bush-backed plan because it is ``ill
timed, ill considered and damaging ... helping only the richest of
our citizens and unfair to the middle class,'' he said.
   The capital gains tax cut is part of a huge budget bill before
the House. The package would be contentious even without the tax
fight, because it also contains changes in the Medicare
catastrophic health coverage plan, new federal child care programs,
and dozens of other issues with divided support.
   Nearly buried beneath the controversial issues is the bill's
underlying purpose, which is reducing the federal deficit.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, D-Minn., said a review of the bill showed
that much of the deficit-reduction in the package was
``disingenuous,'' and after three years the bill would be adding to
the red ink.
   Still, Frenzel said he would probably vote for the bill if it
includes the GOP-supported capital gains tax cut. He didn't put
that in the ``disingenuous'' category, but included figures showing
that it, too, would begin adding billions of dollars to the deficit
after an initial period of added revenues.

   The stock market got a slight boost early in the day from a

   The Commerce Department reported that factory orders for ``big

3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year.
   However, the July data was revised downward from down 2.2
percent to down 2.5 percent, more than expected. Orders in june had
risen 1.3 percent.
   Moreover, a closely-watched section of the report showed that
non-defense capital goods had dropped 9.8 percent to $37.4 billion.
Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment
plans.
   ``What we're seeing is a bargain-hunting phase helped along by
program trading,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A sharp rise in Japan's stock market overnight was also giving
some support to the U.S. market, analysts said.

   A subsidiary of Whittaker Corp. and two
former executives pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed a
Marine Corps contracting official to increase the value of Pentagon
electronic contracts their company obtained.
   Whittaker Command and Control Systems pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to defraud the government and two counts of bribing
former Marine Corps official Jack Sherman with nearly $75,000
between 1982 and 1988.
   The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines,
civil penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation.
   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, the former head of the subsidiary, and
John F. Van Tassel, ex-director of operations at its Fayetteville,
Ark., facility, also entered guilty pleas before U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton.
   The plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by a
corporation since the investigation began last year. Teledyne
Electronics and Hazeltine Corp. have both entered guilty pleas for
their roles in the procurement scandal.
   According to court papers, officials of Whittaker Corp. of Los
Angeles were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began before the
company acquired the subsidiary in 1986.
   The bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company was
known as Lee Telecommunications and continued two years after its
acquisition by Whittaker.
   Lamberth was a stockholder of the company and became head of the
subsidiary following its acquisition by Whittaker. Court papers
said Lamberth hid the scheme from Whittaker officials.
   The bribes allegedly were funneled to Sherman through defense
consultants John Marlowe, Thomas Muldoon and Donald Illeman.
   Marlowe is cooperating with the FBI's continuing investigation
of Pentagon procurement fraud dubbed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
Muldoon and Illeman have not been charged.
   Sherman, who pleaded guilty to taking bribes from Marlowe as
part of an FBI undercover sting, signed authorizations that greatly
enhanced the value of two contracts the company obtained to help
the Marines develop a battlefield air traffic control system, court
papers said.
   Sherman signed papers increasing the value of one contract from
$600,000 to $2.5 million, according to the papers, and also
authorized the enhancement of another contract's value from
$540,000 to $3.6 million.
   He also authorized the transfer to Lee Telecommunications of
another contract worth $1.6 million when the company that first
obtained the deal had difficulty developing software, the court
papers said.
   Lamberth faced a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to
$500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery.
   Van Tassel could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined
$250,000 for his bribery plea.
   Hilton scheduled a Dec. 15 sentencing proceeding for both
defendants, who have agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

failed to return a telephone call immediately today, but the
company declined coment on Monday.
   Coca-Cola Co., the Atlanta-based soft drink maker that owns 49
percent of Columbia's stock, said Monday it was aware Columbia was
in talks and would consider whatever recommendation may be made,
but declined further comment.
   Columbia triggered a sharp runup in its stock price Monday when
it announced that it was ``in discussions with a third party
involving the acquisition for cash of all of Columbia's outstanding
shares.''
   The Dow Jones News Service, citing unnamed entertainment
industry sources, said Sony had offered to buy Columbia for $26 to
$28 a share. With 112.7 million shares outstanding, that would
value Columbia at $2.93 billion to $3.15 billion. It also has about
$1.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding.
   The New York Times reported in its Tuesday editions that Sony
made an offer of $3.4 billion cash, attributing it to an
unidentified source. The Times said Columbia's board was expected
to accept the bid, possibly as soon as Wednesday.
   Foreign companies have shown a ravenous appetite for U.S.-made
films and TV programming in recent months as cable and satellite
channels have opened up in European and Asian markets.
   Less than two weeks ago, for instance, MGM-UA Communications Co.
accepted a $1.5 billion buyout bid from the Qintex Group of
Australia. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., also based in Australia,
had offered $1.4 billion for MGM-UA.
   MGM-UA said it had active buyout discussions with Sony in late
1988.
   Analysts say Sony, which bought CBS Records for $2 billion in
January 1988, is eager to own entertainment ``software'' such as
movies and TV shows as a complement to the hardware such as VCRs
and television sets it has been making for years.
   ``There are only a limited supply of companies like this,''
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon said of Columbia. He follows the
entertainment business for the investment firm Crowell Weedon &amp; Co.
in Los Angeles.
   Columbia Pictures operates two movie studios, Columbia Pictures
and Tri-Star Pictures, and has a library of more than 2,700 film
titles and more than 260 TV series.
   Recent movie releases from Columbia have included ``Ghostbusters
II,'' ``The Karate Kid Part III,'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...
'' while Tri-Star has come out with ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil''
and ``Lock Up.''
   Columbia is one of the leading suppliers of TV programming
through its Columbia Pictures Television and Merv Griffin
Enterprises units.
   Columbia produces or distributes 11 TV series that are being
aired in prime time, including ``Who's The Boss,'' ``Designing
Women'' and ``Married ... with Children.''
   Columbia also owns Merv Griffin Enterprises, whose shows include
``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy,'' the two highest-rated
syndicated shows on U.S. television.
   In addition, the company owns Loews Theatre Management Corp.,
one of the leading motion picture chains with 820 screens in 220
locations as of the close of its fiscal year, which ended Feb. 28.
   Columbia Pictures earned $16 million, or 14 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.62 billion in the fiscal year.

   Japanese and West German central banks today
intervened in currency markets for the second consecutive day,
driving down the value of the dollar in an effort to reduce the
U.S. trade deficit.
   The intervention followed broader action on Monday when the
United States, Great Britain, Canada and France joined the Bank of
Japan and West German Bundesbank in concerted dollar selling.
   The actions are in line with a weekend statement by the Group of
Seven industrial countries _ the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy and Canada _ expressing
displeasure with the dollar's strength and fear that its rise in
recent months could blunt improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.
   A strong dollar hurts the trade gap by making U.S. goods more
expensive on foreign markets, while lowering the price of imports
to American consumers.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar today fell 0.15 yen to a closing 142.80 Japanese
yen. It was quoted at the same level later in London. The U.S.
currency was worth 1.9035 West German marks in early trading. On
Friday, before the G-7 meeting, the dollar bought 146 yen and 1.95
marks.
   Meanwhile, the world's financial officials began meetings today
of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister
lending organization, the World Bank.
   Delegates to the meeting are discussing a range of topics from
the deterioration of the environment in developing countries, the
Third World's crushing $1.3 trillion debt burden, and the movement
of Poland and Hungry from communism to free-market economies.
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, pushed today for
a doubling of the fund's resources from the current $120 billion,
but ran into resistance from Great Britain, Saudi Arabia and the
United States, which has veto power over the matter.
   ``The fund has to be of credible size, so that it gives
confidence to the membership and to financial markets that it could
respond adequately to any unexpected shock, such as those of the
mid 1970s and early 1980s,'' he said.
   On Third World debt, Camdessus called on private banks to step
up their lending to developing countries, even as they are forced
to write off old debt as part of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady's debt strategy.
   ``It is now vital to establish the necessary conditions to bring
about a more appropriate contribution from the private sector,'' he
said.
   World Bank President Barber B. Conable said economic development
must be coupled with new efforts to preserve the environment in
Third World countries.
   ``It will be impossible to improve the quality of life ...
unless we do much more to conserve our global environment,'' he
said, singling out a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions, which
contribute to global warming, as a goal.
   He also said the Third World, which spends $200 billion a year
on defense, more than its combined expenditure on health and
education, must devote fewer resources to the military if it
expects to prosper.
   ``Developing countries on one side, and their arms suppliers and
creditors on the other, must adapt to a world where budgets are
tight,'' he said. ``... In evaluating their military expenditures,
governments should be realistic, but they also should remember the
human consequences of these choices.''
   On Monday, officials attending the meetings expressed
satisfaction with the results of the intervention.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters it
reflected ``the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in
monetary terms.'' Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a
decline in the dollar was ``appropriate and reasonable'' and
pronounced the action by central banks ``obviously quite
successful.''
   On other fronts Monday:
   _Brady pushed for expansion of his Third World debt strategy,
announced in March, which has so far produced tentative agreements
between creditor banks and Mexico and the Philippines.
   ``Important progress is being made within the strengthened debt
strategy. We must now push ahead to ensure that the benefits of the
strategy reach a broad range of countries,'' Brady told the
Development Committee of the World Bank, which met Monday in
preparation for today's meeting of the boards of governors of the
two world lending organizations.
   _William Ryrie, executive vice president of the International
Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, offered Polish
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz help in setting up a new
financial system.
   Ryrie said the efforts are centering on creating a new banking
system. He said ``two or three'' Western European banks, which he
declined to name, have already expressed an interest.

   The stock market was higher in moderate trading
today, but had given back some earlier gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.39 points to
2,674.58 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 17.29 points
an hour earlier. On Monday it fell 22.42 points.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a margin of nearly 2 to 1
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 814 issues up, 434 down and
527 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 69.13 million shares.
   The stock market got a slight boost early in the day from a
government report that showed surprising strength in new factory
orders for durable goods.
   The Commerce Department reported that factory orders for ``big
ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose
3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year.
   However, the July data was revised downward from down 2.2
percent to down 2.5 percent, more than expected. Orders in june had
risen 1.3 percent.
   Also, a closely-watched section of the report showed that
non-defense capital goods had dropped 9.8 percent to $37.4 billion.
Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment
plans.
   ``What we're seeing is a bargain-hunting phase helped along by
program trading,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A sharp rise in Japan's stock market overnight also gave some
support to the U.S. market, analysts said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was 0.95

<TEXT>
   The roar of blast furnaces, the grinding
of ore in the crusher room and the rattle of conveyors that have
sustained this town for 90 years have come to a halt since the
Mexican army closed the Cananea copper mine.
   Only the sound of birds in the walnut and cottonwood trees of
Cananea's central plaza, basketballs bouncing on outdoor courts,
dogs barking and popular music drifting on the breeze remain.
   ``What an ugly silence,'' said Herminia de Tona, as she and her
retired miner husband watched the sunset from the front porch of
their home overlooking the open pit of Mexico's largest copper
mine. ``The government left us in the street.''
   The Cananea mine has been an icon of the Mexican labor movement
since 1906, when strikers who survived bloody military repression
went on to become leaders of the Mexican Revolution. Mindful of
that symbolic background, the government sent the army in on Aug.
20 when it announced the bankruptcy of the 90 percent state-owned
Compania Minera de Cananea.
   The mine closure threw some 3,000 union mineworkers out of jobs,
causing worry in the town of 35,000 whose economy revolves around
the mine. ``We don't know what's going on. We're all uncertain,''
said Maria Elena Lopez, who has two nephews who worked in the mine.
Picking pink roses outside her red brick home, she added,
``Everybody here is affected.''
   Sales in local stores have dropped by 90 percent because so many
of the towns' breadwinners were put out of work, according to the
local chamber of commerce.
   ``We were selling 2 million pesos (about $800) worth a day,''
said pharmacy owner Dina Carillo. ``We are down to 600,000 now. We
have to give credit to people and we don't know if they're going to
be able to pay.''
   The Cananea mine had been operating in the black, producing 3
percent of the world's copper and 45 percent of Mexico's output, at
a cost of 90 cents a pound in times when buyers are paying more
than $1 a pound for the metal. But the government has been trying
to sell the operation to private investors as part of a national
privatization effort.
   State ownership of companies has decreased from 1,222 to 744
since 1982.
   Two deals to sell the mine fell through last year, and the
government is looking for a third chance.
   Local Section 65 spokesman Arturo Borjorquez of the Industrial
Union of Miners, Metallurgical Workers and Allied Trades of the
Mexican Republic says the bankruptcy announcement, one week before
mineworkers were set to go on strike for collective bargaining
contract demands, was a means to break the union and make the
operation more attractive to private investors.
   ``I think the government wants to dress up the bride so she can
get married,'' he said.
   The mineworkers earned $3,000 to $4,000 per year, plus benefits.
The government says their demands amounted to a 330 percent
increase in salary and benefits.
   Nacional Financiera, the government bank and majority
shareholder in the mine, called the move ``a painful measure, but
the only viable option.''
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told labor leaders and
lawmakers in Mexico City that all companies privatized under this
strategy should be seen as opportunities for worker ownership.
Labor Secretary Arsenio Farrell subsequently offered miners 25
percent control of the operation.
   Union rank-and-filer members have talked about assuming
ownership responsibilities in the past, but have never made a
formal proposal, Borjorquez says.
   Miners organizing for better pay and conditions in 1906 were
brutally put down by Mexican troops and U.S. reinforcements, in one
of the first trade union movements in Mexico. More than 20 miners
died in the fight and dozens more were imprisoned. Today the
``Martyrs of 1906'' are immortalized in a folk song whose lyrics
are emblazoned on a signboard inside the Cananea jail where some of
the strikers were detained.
   This time, when the army came in ``there was not a single case
of mistreatment,'' said Mario Elizarde, now in charge of guarding
the idled mine facilities.
   Army helicopters dropped leaflets over the town, announcing the
bankruptcy, as 3,000 soldiers were martialed into the mine. ``The
government just wanted to be secure,'' said Elizarde.
   When the troops arrived, Cananea Security Chief Nick Shaw and
Mayor Francisco Javier Taddei agreed to order the town's 12
cantinas and all other liquor outlets closed. ``It was a preventive
measure,'' Shaw said.
   The weekly dances in the town square were called off, too, a
measure that upset local youth. ``It's making life hard on us
kids,'' said Ana Veronica Rojas, who was joined by other
high-schoolers in her complaints.
   The army pulled out after six days, and the union staged a
symbolic mine takeover on Aug. 28, the day miners had set to strike
for contract renegotiation demands before the bankruptcy
declaration.
   The company's bankruptcy administrator, Financiero Nacional
Azucarera, has said the miners will get severance pay set by
federal labor law, although their contract calls for six times as
much.
   The miners have refused to accept severance pay and appealed the
bankruptcy decision, demanding that the mine be reopened, their
contract observed and that contract negotiations be taken up.
   Unions, organizations and individuals in the United States have
sent food and clothing to Cananea to help the mineworkers and their
families. The government and the Institutional Revolutionary Party
have also sent provisions.
   Union leaders and Labor Department officials are negotiating in
Mexico City as bankruptcy administrators settle the details of
accounts due and the government debates the future of the sleeping
copper giant.

   The face of General Motors Corp.'s minivans has
undergone plastic surgery and Chrysler Corp. may not like GM's nose
job.
   Ever since small passenger vans caught the fancy of American
buyers, Chrysler has commanded a dominant share of the market. GM
is hoping its long-hooded minivans will compel Chrysler owners to
switch makes.
   While the auto market as a whole likely will shrink during the
next year, there are predictions of continued growth in minivans, a
segment which has seen rapid expansion since 1983, when Chrysler
introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager.
   The minivan market actually is older than that. Volkswagen
imported a compact van starting in 1950 and Ford Motor Co. in the
early 1960s sold a Falcon Club Wagon, a half-foot shorter than its
current Aerostar minivan.
   Since the minivan's popularity was ignited seven years ago,
Chrysler has commanded more than 50 percent of the segment of the
light-truck market, which includes minivans.
   Chrysler's share is beginning to slip as the Ford Aerostar and
the Mazda MPV grow in popularity. The unknown in the minivan
formula is how much of the market GM will get. Chrysler executives
have conceded they will lose some of their share, perhaps a
percentage point or two.
   ``But we expected that,'' said Robert Lutz, president of
Chrysler Motors Corp., the company's vehicle-making arm. While
Chrysler has slapped big incentives on many of its vehicles, the
Voyager and Caravan have been exempt.
   The patients in GM's plastic surgery are the Chevrolet Lumina
APV, Pontiac Trans Sport and Oldsmobile Silhouette, rakishly styled
minivans made at GM's North Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly plant. Over
the past few months, the company has given plant employees loaner
vans to drive around the New York countryside to let folks get an
eyeful of the futuristic-looking vehicles.
   The GM minivan was originally for the corporation's Pontiac and
Chevrolet divisions, and Oldsmobile was added later, said a source
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Capacity of the North Tarrytown plant is about 200,000 minivans
a year and the mix among the three divisions can be changed
relatively easily. Like other minivan makers, GM officials expect
buyers to come from those looking at sedans and station wagons and,
to a smaller extent, minivan owners ready to trade in their
vehicles.
   GM is banking on some of those current minivan buyers being
intrigued by the shape of the GM versions. The plastic-bodied
vehicles sport a snout that would have made Cyrano de Bergerac
jealous.
   Analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York said he
thinks the new GM minivans are quite attractive.
   The front-wheel-drive vehicles join the conventionally styled
Chevrolet Astro, which is being offered in four-wheel drive for
1990, in the assault on Chrysler's hold on the minivan market. All
Chrysler's minivans are front-wheel drive.
   ``It's the biggest threat that Chrysler minivans have received
to date,'' Brady said. ``There really hasn't been anything that
would serve as a direct substitute; the others have either been
smaller or rear-wheel drive.''
   The minivan battle isn't just between GM and Chrysler.
   Ford continues to offer its Aerostar, and Japanese companies are
hoping to grab larger pieces of the minivan pie.
   Chrysler isn't sitting still, either. It is offering a Town &amp;
Country version of the minivan, more expensive than the Caravan or
Voyager but loaded with extras, including leather seats and a
compass.
   ``We'll sell out two (minivan) plants,'' Lutz said, speaking of
the St. Louis, Mo., and Windsor, Ontario, factories.
   Lutz estimated the introduction of the GM minivans will add
about 200,000 of the vehicles to the road next year, cutting
slightly into Chrysler's share.
   Those new purchasers, he added, will come primarily from
potential station-wagon buyers. Chrysler is offering no station
wagons for 1990.
   Sales of minivans last year amounted to 725,081 units, a 21.1
percent increase over the year before. The vehicle's share of the
light-truck market has climbed to 13.8 percent last year from 7.4
percent in 1985.

   BAT Industries PLC, which is fending off a hostile
$22 billion bid from Hoylake Investments Ltd., on Tuesday announced
a major restructuring that includes the sale of its U.S. retail
operations.
   BAT said it would reshape itself to concentrate on tobacco and
fast-growing financial services.
   Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier heading
Hoylake's bid, said he welcomed BAT's plan as a ``first step'' to
the ``unbundling'' plan he has proposed.
   He said he would pursue his takeover attempt and said the
bidding group for BAT would vote in favor of the restructuring.
   The British conglomerate said it would sell its retailing
interests in the United States, which include Saks Fifth Avenue and
Marshall Field's stores, as well as other smaller businesses.
   It said it would create two new publicly held companies by
giving its existing shareholders shares in its British retailing
company Argos, as well as shares in a combination of its paper
companies Wiggins Teape, and Appleton.
   BAT also plans to buy back 10 percent of its shares and to
``significantly increase'' its dividend for 1989.
   These measures require shareholder approval, and BAT has called
a special shareholders meeting for Oct. 19.
   The Hoylake bidding group has offered $14.14 worth of securities
for each BAT share. Hoylake has suspended the offer while U.S.
state insurance commissions review its proposed change of ownership
of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
   Hoylake has vowed to ``unbundle'' BAT by selling off all its
non-tobacco interests.
   Hoylake and other critics of BAT have complained that BAT's
share price doesn't reflect the true value of its underlying
businesses and is constrained by the relatively slow growth of its
tobacco businesses.
   Now BAT is seeking to fight off the Hoylake bid by addressing
this problem.
   The Hoylake offer, however, has attracted little interest from
BAT's shareholders and analysts have said that the bidders will
have to increase their offer and include some cash in order to
succeed.
   ``We can now accelerate the strategy of concentrating on
financial services and tobacco,'' BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said
in a statement.
   ``The board now believes that the five decisive steps will
continue the long-term development of the group and address our
concern about the value of BAT shares on the stock market compared
to the underlying value of the businesses.''
   BAT said it envisions that tobacco will provide steady earnings
growth and strong cash flow which will complement the more rapid
growth expected in financial services during the 1990s. These two
businesses will represent ``an exceptionally powerful combination''
to enhance shareholder value in the years ahead, it said.
   BAT said tobacco and financial services now contribute about
$1.5 billion and $13.36 billion, respectively, to its earnings.
   BAT forecast pre-tax profit of $3.2 billion this year, a 22
percent increase over 1988. Earnings per share also were forecast
to rise by 22 percent to $1.23.

   OPEC ministers scrambled on Tuesday to patch
together an agreement on their production plans for the rest of the
year.
   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries gathered in late morning but postponed an early
evening meeting to give them more time to come up with a new accord.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto announced the delay, saying ``new
thinking (was) being developed.'' Shortly before then, an Iranian
delegate said his country had offered a new plan for raising the
production ceiling in the final quarter of the year.
   The ministers were arguing over whether they can boost
production from their current limit of 19.5 million barrels a day
in the final quarter, without upsetting prices.
   ``It seems (there will be) a little increase,'' said a senior
member of one delegation, who demanded anonymity.
   ``But we still have different positions,'' he said. ``It's a
slow process.''
   ``We have to argue a little,'' said Kuwait's Ali Khalifa
al-Sabah after the two-hour meeting. ``Otherwise, it wouldn't be
OPEC.''
   The ministers seemed determined to try to rescue the talks,
which were on the verge of collapse Monday evening.
   ``We have come back from the edge of the precipice,'' said a
senior delegate midway through the two-hour long morning meeting.
He also demanded anonymity.
   The ministers were reported close to a deal Monday on raising
the production ceiling, but then hit some snags forcing them to
postpone formal discussions.
   Their negotiations _ most taking place in their rooms at a
luxury Geneva hotel _ have centered on a lifting the ceiling
between 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, according
to delegates.
   They also must decide how to distribute any increase among the
13 member nations. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want bigger
shares than now allotted them. Others argue the extra amount should
be shared proportionately.
   Late Monday evening, Subroto said, ``We think that (Tuesday)
could be our last look at the routes to take.''
   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22
million barrels a day in the October-December period.
   The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has said
prices could reach $18 even if the cap were lifted to as much as
21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if all adhered to their
quotas.
   The talks, which began Saturday, are officially held by a
monitoring panel made up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   The other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates _ were invited to attend.

<HEAD>Cosmetics Industry Says Animal Testing Still Necessary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The cosmetics industry must have the option of
testing its products on animals while trying to develop alternative
methods to ensure those products are safe for consumers, an
industry spokesman said Tuesday.
   Edward Kavanaugh, president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and
Fragrance Association, said the industry regards ``the safety of
(its) consumers as their primary responsibility and highest
priority.''
   Responding to efforts to ban the use of animals in such product
testing, Kavanaugh said the industry is trying to develop
alternatives.
   However, ``makers of personal care products must continue to
have the option of using animal research data,'' he said.
   Animal rights activists who gathered outside the industry news
conference argued that alternatives already have been found and are
being used.
   ``Major corporations ... have switched to in vitro or non-animal
methods, including cell-culture techniques, testing on membranes,
computer modeling,'' Susan Rich of People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals told reporters.
   The nation's largest cosmetics company, Avon, has invested
millions of dollars to develop such non-animal testing
alternatives, company spokesman John Cox said in a telephone
interview.
   However, Cox said Avons backs the industry association position
on testing because ``there is no one test or even a series of tests
that could be developed for everybody's products.''
   ``Until everybody has developed alternatives, we feel they ought
to have the option of testing,'' he said.
   Eight states _ California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Hawaii _ are considering
legislation to ban animal testing for cosmetics, household and
pharmaceutical products.

<HEAD>Lessons In Capitalism for New Breed Of East Bloc Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With much of the communist world planning
economic retooling, lessons in capitalism await at the first
business administration schools designed to turn a new breed of
East bloc managers into competitive, market-oriented executives.
   A fundamentally different business environment is developing as
economically weak Poland and increasingly troubled Hungary cut
restraints on domestic entrepreneurs, demand that state-run
enterprises be profitable and open their borders to foreign
investors.
   A handful of executive training programs are being organized to
meld Western management techniques with the realities of Eastern
European business.
   ``Intellectually, these are not new concepts,'' says Andrzej
Kosminski, a Warsaw University professor creating the International
Business School to open Oct. 23 near the capital.
   ``But let's say that in our system of management, there was no
use up to now for that kind of approach ... because of a system
that was obviously in basic contradiction to sound business
practices.''
   Kosminski's school will offer the first East bloc equivalent of
a Master's of Business Administration. In addition, Western
companies are opening business skills schools in Poland and Hungary.
   During more than four decades of centralized planning for
captive consumers in communist-ruled nations, business decisions
were made by remote bureaucratic ministries. There was litle need
to worry about developing hot-selling products, finding market
niches, advertising and packaging.
   Motivating workers, pleasing customers, direct foreign trade and
cost saving largely are new concepts for the would-be East bloc
entrepreneur.
   ``Our business people are used to thinking in socialist
conditions: `I produce because I must cover the social need.' This
is nonsense,'' said Bogda Zukowska, a journalist for Poland's
Economic Life newspaper.
   ``Now they are starting to think, `I must produce because I
would like to sell and earn money, and I must do my best to cope
with the market, what the market needs and the cost of
production,''' she said.
   Hopes for resurrecting Poland's economy hinge largely on foreign
investment and domestic private enterprise. But Poles must learn
how the West does business when there is competition for customers
who have a range of choices, and foreign investors must learn how
business works in what Kosminski calls Poland's ``negotiable''
economy.
   At the International Business School, 48 Polish business people,
some private entrepreneurs and others sent by their state-owned
enterprises, have signed up for the first semester at a cost of
about $250.
   The school also will offer orientation programs for Western
managers interested in doing business in the East bloc and offer
consulting services from students who are doing case studies.
   In Budapest, the Hungarian Management Institute was established
in November 1988 through a joint venture with Italian
organizations. A 10-month ``junior executive'' program is offered
along with lecture series for managers.
   A Canadian-Polish partnership is starting the International
School of Management this fall, offering programs for executives
and courses on ``English for business'' and ``How to start your own
business.''
   Polish regulations on starting private businesses were loosened
this year under a privatization of enterprises considered crucial
for turning the economy toward capitalism, filling empty stores and
reviving commercial links with the West.
   Before these new businesses _ and those being salvaged from the
socialist sector _ can enter the competitive market abroad or
prosper at home, the entrepreneurs will need new techniques,
Kosminski said.
   The classes at his school are ``designed to train the elite of
Polish managers as efficient, market oriented and globally
oriented, socially responsible, competent and reliable business
partners,'' according to a prospectus.
   Polish professors and visiting lecturers will offer courses in
Polish and English _ materials on such subjects as international
marketing and finance are virtually unavailable in Polish _ to be
held one week a month through four semesters over two years so
participants can continue to work.
   Students will learn accounting, business law and quality
control, as well as business protocol, how to organize receptions
and what to say in press releases.
   ``They will combine a knowledge of international business and
international standards of doing business with local specificity,''
Kosminski said.
   Polish managers also will be needed to help Western executives
investing in the country maneuver through logistical and
bureaucratic obstacles.
   ``Our business environment is still exotic,'' Kosminski said,
with multiple currency markets, supplies from typing paper to
office chairs virtually unavailable and an endless string of
``arrangements'' needed to handle the ``negotiable'' bureaucracy.
   ``It is difficult for foreign businesses,'' he said. ``That's
why they need intermediaries, people who know both cultures, and I
think some of our graduates might be able to play that role.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans
prices tumbled and corn futures were mostly lower at the close
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A forecast of ideal harvest weather was depressing corn and
soybeans at the start of the day, analysts said, then professional
fund buying pushed prices higher. But the rally didn't hold and
prices declined toward the end of the session.
   Jon Horton, an analyst for Research Department Inc., said a lack
of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures
prices.
   Wheat prices, however, were supported by Monday's announcement
from the U.S. Agriculture Department of a sale to China of 300,000
metric tons of the commodity and anticipation of more export
business this week, traders said.
   Activity in the corn pit was light as traders await a USDA grain
report later this week, said Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 3} cents higher, with
December at $3.93} a bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to 1 cent
higher, with December at $2.29} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{

<HEAD>IBM Reveals Big Plans for Its Personal Computer Design</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday
revealed ambitious plans for Micro Channel Architecture, its
patent-covered design for the way information moves around inside
its personal computers.
   IBM also said that Micro Channel is theoretically capable of
transferring data at 160 million bytes per second, eight times as
fast as its current speed limit. A byte represents one letter or
number.
   The announcements were intended in part to counter the momentum
of a standard that is being pushed by the ``Gang of Nine'' _ rival
makers of personal computers such as Compaq Computer Corp.
   Advanced Logic Research Inc. recently said it will begin
shipping the first computer built to that rival standard in October.
   IBM said it intends to use Micro Channel not only with personal
computers, but eventually with high-speed workstations and even
mainframe computers _ a landmark in the growing importance of
personal computers.
   Although IBM's mainframe line uses a different system for
internal data transfer, the company said Micro Channel would
eventually become the way that mainframes communicate with personal
computers and workstations.
   As a sign of the Micro Channel's importance, IBM said the design
would form the heart of a new line of workstations that will
replace the relatively unsuccessful RT PC late this year or early
in 1990.
   IBM has tried to make Micro Channel into an industry standard,
but companies that have come out with compatible machines under
license to IBM have had limited success. IBM is hoping that
Tuesday's announcements will convince customers that Micro Channel,
announced in 1987, is the wave of the future.
   ``They're trying to show a sense of order in a potentially
chaotic environment,'' said Sam Albert, a former IBM executive who
is now a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.
   IBM's rivals say their personal computer standard is better
because there are more add-on devices that will work with it. But
IBM said there are more than 1,000 add-on devices made by other
companies to enhance the IBM Personal System-2, and more in the
works.
   In addition, Intel Corp. and Chips and Technologies Inc. both
said Tuesday they were working with IBM on developing sets of chips
that other companies could use to make compatible add-on devices
for the Micro Channel.
   IBM reaffirmed that it would come out with a personal computer
built on Intel Corp.'s latest microprocessor, the high-speed i486,
by the end of the year. It cut prices and introduced new variations
on several existing models in its Personal System-2 line.

<HEAD>BAT Reshapes Itself In Attempt to Defeat Hoylake Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC on Tuesday proposed the sale of
its U.S. retailing businesses as part of a restructuring the
conglomerate hoped would defeat Hoylake Investments Ltd.'s $22
billion hostile takeover bid.
   The planned restructuring was intended to enhance the value of
BAT's stock, company chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.
   Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier who leads
Hoylake, said he welcomed BAT's proposal as a first step toward his
plans for breaking up the conglomerate. Goldsmith said he would not
give up his takeover attempt, which has been suspended while the
group tries to overcome regulatory obstacles.
   Securities analysts said BAT's proposals would enhance the value
of the British conglomerate's stock and was likely to be approved
by its shareholders. But they said Hoylake could still bid for what
is left of BAT.
   Hoylake has offered 13.4 billion pounds, or $22 billion, in
securities for BAT.
   BAT said it would reshape itself to concentrate on its tobacco
business, which is steady and generates cash, and its fast-growing
financial services segment. This would be a significant departure
from its previous strategy of gradually diversifying away from
tobacco.
   The retained businesses are expected to account for 80 percent
of BAT's forecast 1989 pre-tax profit of $3.2 billion, BAT said.
   The British conglomerate said it would sell its U.S. retailing
business, which includes 46 Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 24
Marshall Field's stores. The two retailers have combined annual
sales of $2 billion.
   These and other planned, smaller divestitures could fetch a
total of $2.4 billion, analysts said.
   BAT said it also would create two new publicly held companies by
giving its existing shareholders a stake in its British retailing
company Argos, as well as stock in a combination of its paper
companies, Wiggins Teape and Appleton. Appleton is based in
Wisconsin.
   BAT said it also would buy back 10 percent of its shares _ which
would cost 1.24 billion pounds, or $2 billion, at Tuesday's closing
price on London's Stock Exchange.
   The company also pledged to significantly increase its
dividends. The total dividend for 1989 could go as high as 30
pence, or 48 cents, per share, a 49 percent increase over the
previous year's payment, BAT said.
   BAT called a special shareholders meeting for Oct. 19 to vote on
the proposed restructuring.
   BAT stock rose 2 pence, or 3 cents, a share to close at 818
pence, or $13.17.
   Hoylake has suspended its $14.14 a share offer while state
insurance commissioners in the United States review its proposed
change of ownership of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
   Hoylake has vowed to break up BAT by selling off all its
non-tobacco interests. The group and other critics of BAT have
complained the conglomerate's stock price does not reflect the true
value of its underlying businesses because it is constrained by the
relatively slow growth of its tobacco business.
   Sheehy, in an interview on British radio, said the plan would
give existing shareholders the benefit of splitting up BAT, rather
than allowing Hoylake to take a profit from dismantling the
conglomerate.
   Goldsmith said Hoylake would vote in favor of BAT's plan
although the investor group was not abandoning its bid.
   ``The point is that they've made a first step'' in the direction
of realizing a higher share value for BAT shareholders, which is
the basis of the Hoylake argument, Goldsmith said in a telephone
interview.
   The Hoylake offer has attracted little interest from BAT's
shareholders and analysts have said that the bidding group would
have to increase its bid and include some cash to succeed.
   Andrew Mitchell, an analyst with the London investment firm
Smith New Court PLC, said: ``It does seem likely that they
(shareholders) would approve these (BAT) proposals because it gives
them a bird in the hand.''
   It could take Hoylake nine months to get regulatory clearance in
the United States, he said.
   ``It's a useful start,'' said Nigel Utley, an analyst with Laing
and Cruickshank. ``It will enhance shareholder value, but not
necessarily enough to defeat a serious bid.''

<HEAD>Executive Gets 18 Months in Mail Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street executive who pleaded guilty to
three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former
governor of Guam has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis on Monday also placed Arthur
Abba Goldberg on five years' probation, fined him $100,000 and
ordered him to repay the United States $300,000.
   Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, pleaded guilty July 14 to
three counts of mail fraud.
   He had been accused of funneling $70,000 to former Guam Gov.
Ricardo J. Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election campaign. In
exchange, Bordallo allegedly agreed to generate support for a $300
million housing bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February 1986 of accepting bribes from
Goldberg but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87.
   Goldberg had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a
$750,000 fine in addition to restitution payments, according to
William O'Connor, the U.S. attorney from Guam.
   The three counts referred to money bilked from the Guam Program
Development Fund and a ``lulling letter'' assuring fund authorities
that the transactions were legal.
   A December 1987 indictment charged Goldberg with preparing phony
invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.
   The bank paid the money to Goldberg, who spent $25,000 to buy
campaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ for
Bordallo's unsuccessful re-election bid, O'Connor has said.
   Authorities said Goldberg made his contributions after Bordallo
was promised that he would receive campaign contributions if he
supported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved by
the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp; Wright has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In exchange for Goldberg's guilty pleas, 46 other counts
alleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud were
dismissed. The case was moved from Guam, 3,800 miles west of
Hawaii, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.
   Twelve of the original counts against Goldberg were related
directly to Guam. The balance referred to fraud involving the use
of the Commercial Bank of Americas in transactions that did not
involve the U.S. territory.
   In August 1987, Gov. Joseph Ada sued Matthews &amp; Wright for the
return of $14 million in fees the firm had received, as well as
$250 million in punitive damages. O'Connor said in July the suit
had been settled, but he released no details.

   The stock market finished higher today, but
fizzled badly in the last hour of trading giving up most of the
day's gains.
   The market opened strong in response to a government report that
showed surprising strength in new factory orders for durable goods.
   The Commerce Department reported that factory orders for ``big
ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose
3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. The market
had expected a slight decline.
   ``The market did mainly what it has been doing the last few
weeks -following interest rates,'' said L. Crandall Hays, equities
analyst with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. On Monday, the stock and bond
markets fell as the dollar plunged with central banks intervening
to push the currency lower, and interest rates rose.
   ``Interest rates were up yesterday. Today the pressure is off,''
Hays said.
   The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 21 points at one point in
the session, before a sharp pull-back in the final hour of trading.
The Dow Jones average had dropped 22.42 points on Monday.
   Blue-chip issues led the broad-based rally. Entertainment stocks
were active after Monday's reports that Columbia Pictures
Entertainment was in takeover talks with Sony Corp. of Japan.
   Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions
in the final week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during
much of the session.
   Analysts said that the stock market's ability to show strength
without a similar response in the bond market was encouraging. The
credit market posted only a slight change after the durable goods
report.
   Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts said the stock market still
lacked strong leadership.
   ``There's no firm conviction,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous,
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   Shares fell sharply in moderate trading in London
on Tuesday after publication of worse-than-expected trade figures
for August.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most
closely watched market index, finished 23.5 points, or 1.08
percent, lower at 2,336.1.
   The index finished just above its session low of 2,332.4 which
followed news of the current account deficit last month of 1.99
billion pounds, or $3.20 billion, the third worst on record. A 1.5
billion pound, $2.4 billion, deficit had been expected.
   Volume came to 450.8 million shares, up from 280.5 million on
Monday.

   IRAs, curtailed three years ago on grounds
they were an ineffective incentive for saving, are being touted
anew by Democrats as a way to spur the economy without further
enriching the wealthy.
   The liberalized Individual Retirement Account is being offered
as a substitute for the capital-gains tax reduction recommended by
President Bush.
   Most of the tax benefit from either party's proposal would go to
the rich and near-rich, affecting the wallets of the richest
one-tenth of U.S. taxpayers.
   The House is expected to do battle on the issue this week, with
the Senate taking it up next month. The options will be presented
as part of a massive bill whose main purpose is to reduce the
budget deficit.
   ``The choices could not be more stark or compelling,'' House
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., says about the plan
offered by the Democrats.
   White House budget director Richard G. Darman is equally as sure
about the administration proposal.
   ``The choice is clear,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, President Bush vowed to continue his fight for a
lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending impasse with
Congress and triggers across-the-board program cuts. He also
criticized the Democratic alternative as ``unacceptable.''
   ``A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish
the ends for which he was elected. And I plan to do exactly that,''
Bush said, speaking to a group of business people in the Oval
Office.
   The administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital
gains _ profits from the sale of stocks and other investments _ to
19.6 percent until 1992. The top rate would then be raised to 28
percent permanently and gains caused solely by inflation would be
exempted from taxation. The top rate now is 33 percent.
   The Democrats propose allowing all workers not permitted a full
IRA deduction to write off half a contribution up to $2,000 a year.
The money would not be taxed until withdrawn for retirement, as the
down payment on a first home or for college.
   Although the administration generally favors expanded IRAs,
House Democrats added an angle that makes the proposal unacceptable
to the White House: financing IRAs by raising taxes on the richest
600,000 couples and individuals.
   Cutting capital gains or liberalizaing IRAs would represent a
major backing away from the 1986 landmark tax overhaul that
curtailed IRA deductions and eliminated the special rate for
capital gains.
   The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 85.3
percent of the benefit from the the capital-gains reduction, as
approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, would go to those
with incomes over $75,000 a year. Those people file less than 10
percent of all tax returns.
   Just over 49 percent of the new IRA benefit would be collected
by those earning more than $75,000, although the withdrawal
features would help lower-and middle-income taxpayers.
   Backers of the capital-gains cut contend it will pay for itself
by spurring economic activity. Democrats say it will worsen the
deficit after a three-year burst of higher revenues.
   There is no agreement among economists that either plan would
have a lasting effect on the economy.
   Both plans are being promoted as ways to increase the nation's
lagging rate of saving, making more money available for business
expansion and job creation so less will have to be borrowed from
foreigners.
   Although the capital-gains issue was debated at length in the
1988 presidential campaign and has been the subject of
congressional hearings, the notion of expanding IRAs has drawn
little attention since they were curtailed, to the chagrin of
middle-income workers, in 1986.
   In writing its landmark tax overhaul, Congress concluded that
the ultimate goal was the lowest possible individual tax rates.
That meant elimination or reduction of various exclusions and
deductions, and two of the most important were the capital-gains
break and the IRA deduction.
   Rolling back the IRA deduction was made easier when Congress
concluded that the deduction apparently had produced little new
saving, that it had simply encouraged taxpayers to transfer money
from a non-taxable account into a tax-deferred IRA.
   ``I had testified for IRAs, and it was a big disappointment when
evidence indicated they did little to encourage new saving,'' said
Washington economist Michael Evans.
   However, the Institute for Research on the Economics of
Taxation, headed by former Reagan administration official Norman
Ture, now says the early evidence was wrong.
   ``The weight of the evidence is that IRAs have had a substantial
positive net effect on personal saving,'' the institute said in a
report commissioned by Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets.
   At the height of IRA popularity, in 1986, deductions for $37.8
billion in contributions were claimed by 15.5 million taxpayers. A
year later, with the deduction curtailed, contributions of $14.1
billion were deducted on 7.3 million returns.
   Before 1986, any worker could contribute up to $2,000 a year to
a tax-deferred IRA. The overhaul law restricted deductible IRAs to
workers not covered by a company pension and to covered single
workers with incomes $25,000 or less and couples earning $40,000 or
less.
   Single taxpayers with incomes up to $35,000 and couples up to
$50,000 are allowed a partial deduction.

   Central banks sold waves of dollars again
Tuesday but got less satisfying results as the dollar declined only
slightly overall and actually rose against Japan's yen.
   The Group of Seven industrial democracies ganged up against the
dollar after agreeing last weekend that the dollar's rise in recent
months was ``inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.''
   Tuesday's intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent off
the dollar's value, in contrast to Monday's decline of nearly 6
West German pfennigs and 4 Japanese yen.
   Some traders said the attractiveness of U.S. interest rates
might bring investors back to dollar-denominated securities once
the central bankers let up.
   In fact, the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session.
   ``Maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chin
but it has fought back quite nicely,'' said Victor Polce, vice
president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Algemene
Bank Nederland NV in New York.
   Dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had sold
dollars, but they disagreed on how large the sales were.
   Some of the dollar's drop against the West German mark came from
continued speculation that the West German central bank would raise
a key interest rate next month, drawing global investors away from
dollars and into marks.
   In contrast, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen because
fewer people expected the Bank of Japan to raise rates, dealers
said.
   The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 142.80
yen from 142.95 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell
further to 142.50 yen. In New York it rose to 142.35 yen from
142.13 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6215 from $1.6080 late
Monday despite Tuesday's announcement of a worse-than-expected
merchandise trade deficit of 2.29 billion pounds, or $3.69 billion,
in August. In New York the pound rose to $1.6190 from $1.6175
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates, included: 1.8918 West German marks, down from 1.8990; 1.6415
Swiss francs, down from 1.6480; 1.1756 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1763; 6.4110 French francs, down from 6.4370; and 1,366.9 Italian
lire, down from 1,372.9.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8885 West German marks, down from 1.9055; 1.6390 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6565; 6.3990 French francs, down from 6.4540; 2.1480
Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,377.00 Italian lire, unchanged; 1.1750
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1776.
   Gold rose in thin London trading to a late bid price of $367.75
a troy ounce from $367 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to $367.75 bid from $366.75 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 0.33 to a closing bid of
$367.53.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $368.50 from $369.80 on Tuesday. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $367.30 an ounce as
of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $368 late Monday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.31 a
troy ounce, up from $5.27 bid late Monday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.263 an ounce from
$5.283 on Monday.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Prices Fluctuate, Close Higher as OPEC Talks Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures fluctuated throughout the day
Tuesday before closing slightly higher as traders awaited the
outcome of negotiations on OPEC's production limits.
   ``It opened down on OPEC concerns and then it went up on OPEC
concerns and bounced around during the day on different rumors,''
Jim Fiedler, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said of the crude oil market.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of crude oil, finally closed 7 cents higher at $19.53 a
42-gallon barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.
   In Geneva, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were trying to raise the cartel's production ceiling from
its current 19.5 million barrel limit to a level between 20 million
barrels a day and 21 million barrels for the rest of 1989 without
sending prices skidding.
   The ministers twice postponed what was expected to be a final
round of talks to consider a new Iranian proposal. Negotiations
were to resume Wednesday after private bargaining sessions.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said his country had
offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in the last quarter
of the year. Iran suggested hiking the cap to between 20.5 million
barrels a day and 21 million barrels.
   The cartel has been overproducing, pumping more crude than
allowed under an output agreement signed in June. Analysts'
estimate OPEC production at about 22 million barrels daily.
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
Tuesday, heating oil for October delivery picked up 0.20 cent to
settle at 57.71 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for October
delivery fell 1.29 cents to 60.38 cents a gallon amid reports of
plentiful supplies.

   The giant toy store chain Toys R Us Inc. on
Tuesday announced it will open for business in Japan under an
agreement with an arm of fast food powerhouse McDonald's Corp.
   A new company called Toys R Us-Japan is to be 80 percent owned
by the toy company. McDonald's Co. (Japan) Ltd., owned equally by
McDonald's of Oak Brook, Ill., and Japan's Fujita &amp; Co. Ltd., will
control the remaining 20 percent of the new toy company.
   The arrangement will give McDonald's an opportunity to operate
restaurants on toy store sites that will be developed. The first
stores are planned to open in 1991.
   Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us embarked on an overseas expansion
in 1984. By the end of this year the company says its international
division will have 74 stores, including 27 in Canada, 23 in the
United Kingdom, 13 in West Germany, five in France, two each in
Singapore and Malaysia and one each in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   The company, which had sales topping $4 billion last year, bills
itself as the world's biggest specialty toy retailer. At the end of
1989, it will have 404 toy stores in the United States alone and
137 Kids R Us children's clothing stores.

   Auto production and sales are dropping, and that
could mean layoffs around the time the United Auto Workers union
begins gearing up for 1990 contract talks with the Big Three
automakers, analysts said Tuesday.
   The 1990 model year technically begins Oct. 1, although some new
models have been on sale for months. Nevertheless, some of General
Motors Corp.'s buyer incentives on its new cars and trucks took
effect before the vehicles officially went on sale.
   That suggests the industry is grappling with a host of potential
problems in moving its product. Much of the recent focus has been
on GM.
   ``Some of us believe that GM will close some plants permanently
in the next few months,'' said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. He said the disparity between GM's
production capacity and its market share would indicate four plants
could be closed.
   Last week, GM announced it was idling its Lakewood plant in
Atlanta in March, joining recently closed plants in Framingham,
Mass.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Pontiac, Mich.
   GM has scheduled some temporary production cuts next month at a
half-dozen car and truck plants, lasting a week or two apiece,
because of swollen vehicle inventories.
   Ford Motor Co. has said it temporarily would halt production at
a car and truck plant in early October. Chrysler Corp. hasn't
announced any temporary plant closings for October.
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York
estimated that fourth quarter production this year would be 10
percent to 15 percent below last year's levels.
   Production cuts may be hastened by auto dealers, who have said
they won't be ordering as many 1990 vehicles as they did during the
1989 model year. There have been estimates that dealer orders may
fall by as much as 30 percent below last year's levels.
   Analysts also said recent sales activity, including a 12.7
percent jump in mid-September car and truck purchases reported
Monday, supports a theory that current sales are being ``borrowed''
from the fourth quarter, as consumers rush to beat 1990 model year
price increases.
   ``I suspect sales are going to be rather soft in the fourth
quarter,'' Phillippi said.
   Softer sales point to lower production, increased layoffs and a
higher potential for labor problems in the last three months of the
year, as the UAW prepares for Big Three contract talks.
   One UAW source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday
that union officials weren't alarmed but were monitoring production
levels and possible layoffs.
   UAW contracts with each of the Big Three automakers expire Sept.
14, 1990. Preparations for the negotiations, which open next
summer, begin in earnest during the first three months of next year.
   By then, the UAW will be looking back on any temporary layoffs
and ahead to the closing of the Lakewood plant, which will idle
about 2,200 workers.
   ``I think labor relations are going to be very murky in the next
few months,'' Kirnan said.
   In addition to potential layoffs, one question is the kind of
style UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, the new head of the
union's GM Department, will bring to the bargaining table.
   This June, Yokich succeeded Donald Ephlin, who retired. Under
Ephlin's leadership, GM and the union developed cooperative
programs that injected worker participation in some management
decisions, but also created the UAW's largest internal political
fight in the past 40 years.
   Dissidents under the ``New Directions'' banner have criticized
UAW leadership for eroding workers' rights through joint programs.
   But New Directions leader Jerry Tucker said he liked Yokich's
sharp criticism of GM's planned Lakewood closing. Yokich said the
move undermines efforts to develop a new relationship between the
company and the union.

   The stock market finished slightly higher
Tuesday after a strong rally fizzled in the final hour of trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended with a gain of
4.75 points at 2,663.94, after climbing more than 21 points during
the session. On Monday the blue-chip indicator dropped 22.42 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to
3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 740 issues up, 634 down and 556 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.35 million
shares, up from 121.13 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 183.925 million shares.
   The market opened broadly higher, aided by a sharp run-up in
Japan's stock market overnight and an unexpectedly strong U.S.
government report on durable goods.
   The Commerce Department reported that factory orders for ``big
ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose
3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. The markets
had expected a slight decline.
   ``It shows the economy still has some life to it,'' said Charles
Jensen, chief technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp.
   Wall Street analysts said that the stock market's ability to
show strength without a similar response in the bond market was
encouraging. The credit market posted only a slight change after
the durable goods report.
   ``Stocks are showing some independence,'' Jensen said.
   The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 21 points at one point in
the session, before a sharp pull-back in the final hour of trading.
   ``I can't tell you why it sold off,'' said Philip Roth, with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I don't know of any news. The
market's technical position for a rally was weak. Stocks were
rallying on poor volume and it was destined to fade anyway.''
   Blue-chip issues led the broad-based rally in fairly thin
volume, but finished with gainers and losers mostly even.
Entertainment stocks were particularly active after Monday's
reports that Columbia Pictures Entertainment was in takeover talks
with Japan's Sony Corp.
   ``There are only three movie studios left, so there's a scarcity
value in terms of movie studios,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions
in the final week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during
much of the session, traders said.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $3.412 billion, or 0.10
percent in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.19 to 191.47.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Columbia Pictures lost

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.12 to 393.01, and

   President Bush vowed Tuesday to continue his
fight for a lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending
impasse with Congress and triggers across-the-board program cuts.
   He also said he would continue to oppose an ``unacceptable''
Democratic alternative for a liberalized Individual Retirement
Account deduction.
   ``A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish
the ends for which he was elected. And I plan to do exactly that,''
Bush said.
   House Democratic leaders have coupled their plan to expand IRA
deductions with a tax increase on weathly Americans and a more
modest reduction in the capital gains taxes than Bush wants.
   The House is expected to vote on the issue later this week.
   In a letter sent to all members of the House later Tuesday, Bush
reiterated that he would veto the Democratic plan if it reaches his
desk.
   ``No matter how you dress it up, that alternative is a tax
increase _ plain and simple,'' Bush said in the letter. ``That's no
alternative, and my response will be equally plain and simple _
veto.''
   At an Oval Office meeting with a group of business people whose
support for the lower capital gains tax was evident, Bush said ``we
ought to stand up to the understandable political rhetoric on the
other side, rhetoric that we heard all last year and that we're now
hearing once again.''
   Bush was asked by a reporter if he would be willing to see
extensive automatic spending cuts if there is no agreement in the
capital gains battle.
   ``I don't want that, but I'm not ruling it out,'' Bush said.
   The administration and some congressional leaders have suggested
the fight over the capital gains tax appears to have dimmed chances
of reaching a bipartisan spending agreement for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1.
   Congress' failure to enact legislation getting the federal
deficit to under a $110 billion deficit target will trigger
across-the-board cuts Oct. 16 in both domestic and defense programs.
   ``If (Congress) would go forward and do what we've suggested, we
could avoid sequestration (automatic cuts),'' Bush said. ``But I'm
not ruling it out.''
   Bush told the business people: ``It's a tough fight. I obviously
would welcome all your support, which I hope I have.''
   He also said opponents ``simply are wrong'' when they argue that
the capital gains cut is a break for the rich.
   The administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital
gains _ profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other
investments _ to 19.6 percent until 1992. The top rate would then
be raised to 28 percent permanently and gains caused solely by
inflation would be exempted from taxation. The top rate now is 33
percent.
   The Democrats are proposing allowing all workers not permitted a
full IRA deduction to write off half a contribution up to $2,000 a
year.
   House Democrats proposed financing IRAs by raising taxes on the
richest 600,000 couples and individuals, saying it would be a
windfall for high-income taxpayers.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush's capital gains proposal was attacked by
consumer, labor and government watchdog groups.
   ``Capital gains proponents are asking Americans to ignore the
unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to
individuals who need it the least,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
president of Common Cause, a self-styled citizens lobby involved in
government ethics isssues.
   ``Congress is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing
wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over
$200,000 won't cure,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a Ralph Nader organization.

   The surprisingly robust dollar has rebounded to
its levels of nearly three years ago, but economists disagree on
what if anything should be done to knock it back down.
   A strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper for American
consumers while hurting American exporters by raising the cost of
their goods overseas.
   While some economists applaud the dollar-bashing efforts of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations, others say the group's
attempts to lower the dollar are either inadequate or misguided.
   The debate over the dollar's proper level isn't just academic:
the dollar's value affects everything from the trade deficit and
inflation to jobs for American factory workers and the price of a
bottle of imported wine in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
   The Group of Seven nations began flooding the market with
dollars from their reserves after agreeing Saturday in Washington
that the dollar's rise in recent months was ``inconsistent with
longer run economic fundamentals.''
   The central banks knocked the dollar sharply lower Monday, but
continued intervention on Tuesday produced only a slight further
decline. The dollar actually edged up against the Japanese yen on
Tuesday in New York.
   Those who support attacks on the dollar say the dollar at
current levels makes American goods too expensive in world markets
and will cause the nation's trade deficit to start rising again.
That could cost jobs of Americans who work in industries affected
by world trade.
   ``I think it was highly timely that the G-7 finally moved and at
least temporarily has been able to sober the markets,'' said
William Cline, senior economist at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
   But other economists favor leaving the dollar alone, arguing
that it is more important to focus on how well the domestic economy
is faring. Right now, they say, the economy is doing well.
   Trying to knock the dollar down by flooding the market with
dollars or lowering U.S. interest rates could reignite inflation,
says that school of economists.
   ``We're walking a very fine line between making sure the economy
gets enough juice and appearing to flood the economy with too much
fuel,'' said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort
Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Setting policy in light of the dollar instead of focusing on
economic conditions could throw off that delicate balance, Kahan
said.
   Even those who support dollar sales by the central banks say the
tactic won't work all by itself, any more than a lion tamer could
indefinitely hold hungry lions away from a pile of pork chops.
   Global investors will keep buying dollars as long as they
believe they can get a high rate of return on U.S. investments,
such as Treasury bills, factories and real estate.
   Worldwide currency trading has nearly doubled in the last three
years to well over than $300 billion a day, enough to swamp
intervention by central banks over the long run, Cline said.
   ``What we have to do is have the dollar come down as a
consequence of a reduction in our budget deficit, which would cause
lower interest rates in the United States, and it would be that
mechanism that would bring down the dollar,'' he said.
   Cline said he favors action to cut the trade deficit because the
United States is in danger of eventually becoming another Brazil, a
debtor nation forced to lower its living standards to make payments
to foreign creditors.
   But Kahan said, ``The United States is not just another
country.'' Foreigners are accumulating IOUs from the United States
because they see the country as a good place to invest, he said.
   ``We should look at the trade balance but not get overly wrapped
up in it as a problem,'' he said.

   The Citizens and Southern Corp. and Sovran
Financial Corp. announced a $4.7 billion merger Tuesday that will
create the nation's 14th-largest bank.
   C&amp;S, based in Atlanta, and Sovran, based in Norfolk, Va., will
have total assets of $47 billion and almost 1,000 offices in seven
states from Maryland to Florida and the District of Columbia.
   Under a newly formed holding company called Avantor Financial
Corp., the two banks will maintain dual headquarters and retain
current management.
   The merger comes five months after C&amp;S fought off a takeover bid
by North Carolina's NCNB Corp. Unlike that proposal, the C&amp;S-Sovran
deal is a friendly merger.
   In a joint statement, Sovran Chairman Albert B. Gornto Jr. and
C&amp;S Chairman Bennett A. Brown said the deal combines the advantages
of size and market strength with success in community-based banking.
   ``We are creating a large, nationally competitive franchise with
a powerful presence in major high-growth markets, and we're
underwriting it with superior credit quality,'' they said in a
statement.
   ``This is a company that will be completely focused on service,
efficiency and profitability,'' the statement said.
   The boards of the two companies have approved the agreement.
Final approval from shareholders and federal and state regulators
is expected in the first quarter of 1990.
   Both companies will remain in existence as subsidiaries of the
new umbrella organization. A new board of directors will be
established with 15 members from Sovran and 14 from C&amp;S.
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Lacy Shockley, a banking industry
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co. in New York. ``It's
going to create the powerhouse in the Southeast.''
   C&amp;S has 489 bank offices in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
Sovran has 487 offices in Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C.,
Tennessee and Kentucky.
   Scott Scredon, a C&amp;S spokesman in Atlanta, said the merger has
been discussed on and off for about two years.
   ``We feel it's a perfect fit,'' Scredon said. ``We don't overlap
... and we each double our market presence. We both feel it
couldn't be any better.''
   Scredon said customers should not see any immediate changes when
the merger is completed, but once the two institutions pool
resources new services probably will be offered.
   Under the merger agreement, each of Sovran's 59.8 million shares
of outstanding common stock will convert into 1.23 shares of the
new company's common stock. Each of C&amp;S's 62 million shares of
outstanding common stock will convert into 1.0 shares of the new
company's common stock.
   Brown will become chairman and chief executive officer of the
new company while retaining his position at C&amp;S. Gornto will become
chairman of the new company's executive committee and will retain
his position at the Virginia bank.
   Dennis C. Bottorff, Sovran's president and chief operating
officer, will be president and chief operating officer of Avantor
and would become chief executive of the new company upon Brown's
retirement. At that time, Hugh Chapman, now president of C&amp;S, would
become Avantor chairman.
   Last spring, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB targeted C&amp;S in a $2.4
billion takeover bid. C&amp;S officials refused to discuss the
proposal, and NCNB eventually withdrew the offer.

<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A forecast of ideal harvest weather sent some grain futures
prices lower Tuesday, but the selloff helped to bolster cattle
prices.
   Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans prices tumbled
and corn futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Analysts said the outlook for perfect harvest weather in U.S.
growing areas depressed corn and soybeans.
   On other markets, feeder cattle prices rose, live hogs gained,
precious metals fell and energy prices were mixed.
   Jon Horton, an analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago,
said a lack of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on
futures prices.
   Wheat prices, however, were supported by Monday's announcement
from the U.S. Agriculture Department of a sale to China of 300,000
metric tons and anticipation of more export business this week,
traders said.
   Activity in the corn pit was light as traders awaited a USDA
grain report on Thursday, said analyst Susan Leighty of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc in New York.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 4\ cents higher, with December at
$3.94\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to } cent higher, with
December at $2.29} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher,
with December at $1.43{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent to 6\
cents lower, with November at $5.66\ cents a bushel.
   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for live
cattle soared, while feeder cattle prices were higher and pork
complex futures were mixed.
   Live cattle futures rallied on higher cash prices in Texas and
Kansas, analysts said.
   ``Traders wanted something to be bullish about, and when they
got bullish news, they took prices higher,'' said Dale Benson, a
Chicago analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Feeder cattle prices were supported by live cattle prices and a
selloff in grains. Live hogs also were supported by higher cash
prices.
   Live cattle settled .38 cent to 1 cent higher, with the contract
for October at 72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to
.72 cent higher, with September at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs
were .28 cent lower to .27 cent higher with October at 43.42 cents
a pound; and pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher
with February at 48.50 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for precious metals fell on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Gold set a new high of $375.30 for the December contract,
recovering $15 since it hit a low on Sept 15 of $360.60. But later
in the session prices slipped when pressure on the U.S. dollar
subsided Tuesday, said Don Tierney, a precious metals analyst in
New York for Stanley Bell &amp; Co.
   Gold settled $1.30 to $1.60 lower, with the contract for
September at $368.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 2 cents lower,
with September at $5.263 a troy ounce.
   Energy prices were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil prices had a choppy session, losing some ground after
OPEC ministers postponed their meeting in Geneza, Switzerland. The
ministers were studying an Iranian proposal to increase the
production ceiling to between 20.5 million barrels a day and 21
million barrels.
   Unleaded gasoline followed crude lower, but heating oil prices
were higher mainly from traders selling the gasoline and using
those profits to buy heating oil, said Ray Mazzeo, an energy
specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Crude oil was .02 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with the
contract for November at $19.53 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent
to .20 cent higher, with October at 57.71 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was 1.29 cents lower to .08 cent higher, with
October at 60.38 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Independent Stations Blast Trend to Cable</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent television stations Tuesday took a
swing at baseball owners for increasingly limiting television
viewing of the ``American Pastime'' to homes with cable TV.
   Recent agreements giving cable companies rights to New York
Yankees games and a four-year, $400 million contract that gives the
ESPN cable network rights to Wednesday and Sunday night baseball
games typify the flight of sports to cable TV, said Preston Padden,
president of the Assocation of Independent Television Stations.
   Padden, in a letter Tuesday to Francis T. Vincent, the new
commisioner of Major League Baseball, said that given ``the clear
trends in the cable industry ... it seems likely that legislation
will be necessary to preserve sports on free TV.''
   But before that happens, ``we ask you to consider mutually
voluntary changes'' in the ESPN contract, Padden said.
``Specifically, we are concerned about those provisions that
restrict our right to broadcast baseball games on Wednesday and
Sunday evenings.''
   Padden disputed Major League Baseball's assertion that the ESPN
contract would expand TV viewers' choices.
   ``Fans will experience a diminution in the supply of baseball,''
Padden said. ``More to the point, you will be restricting access to
Major League Baseball only to those who have access to cable,
and-or can afford cable rates which average over $25 a month. For
the `American Pastime,' we find this contrary to the public
interest.''
   Calls to the Major League Baseball office in New York for
comment were not immediately returned.
   Padden's letter grew out of a meeting this month in Washington
of TV station executives from 24 of the 26 cities that have Major
League Baseball. The executives agreed to try to get MLB to alter
the ESPN contract.
   The TV executives also were concerned about cable TV contracts
for sports at Big 10, Pacific 10 and Southeastern Conference
schools. They said such contracts point to a day when all sports
will be on pay TV.
   The station executives have enlisted the aid of Sens. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., and Albert Gore, D-Tenn., to press their case in
Congress.
   The National Cable Television Association has said that local
broadcasters are showing 40 percent more professional baseball
games now when compared with 1975 and that cable is not siphoning
away free TV sports.

   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse,
citing regulatory concerns and other problems, announced Tuesday
they had scrapped plans for a merger that would have created the
world's biggest accounting firm.
   A Price Waterhouse official, who asked not to be identified,
said the key stumbling block to the merger was ``concern over the
regulatory environment,'' because the two firms represent so many
competing companies.
   However, another source close to the talks, who asked not to be
named, confirmed published reports that differences over funding of
the firms' retirement plans, the name of the combined firm and
other issues had hampered the talks.
   In a joint statement, the chiefs of the two accounting giants
said the merger discussions ``were discontinued because differences
could not be resolved within a realistic time frame.''
   Joseph E. Connor, chairman of Price Waterhouse, and Lawrence A.
Weinbach, Andersen's chief executive, stated both firms ``have
emerged from the talks with great respect for one another and
better insight into the professional service environment in which
they operate.''
   The statement said confidentiality agreements had been signed by
both firms and ``therefore there will be no public comment by
either firm on details of the discussions.''
   The firms originally announced merger talks in July, amid a
backdrop of other mergers among the Big Eight accounting firms
aiming to face heightened global competition.
   For example, analysts say the firms want to be better positioned
to compete once the 12-nation European Economic Community drops its
internal trade barriers in 1992.
   Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney combined to form Ernst &amp;
Young, now the world's biggest accounting firm, while Deloitte
Haskins &amp; Sells joined forces with Touche Ross &amp; Co., forming No. 4
Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   Price Waterhouse and Andersen announced on Sept. 5 that they
would need more time to continue their negotiations.
   Industry analysts said the Justice Department had been examining
the possible ramifications of an Andersen-Price Waterhouse
combination, which would have merged the nation's second- and
sixth-largest firms, respectively.
   One obstacle to the merger was the potential conflict of
interest in the firms' dealings with such major corporate clients
as International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett Packard Corp.,
the Price Waterhouse official said.
   Chicago-based Andersen's consulting division has joint ventures
with both corporations to develop computer integration products,
while Price is the auditor for both companies.
   Securities and Exchange Commission rules bar an accounting firm
from participating in joint ventures with audit clients because of
possible conflicts of interest.
   The official of New York-based Price Waterhouse said the
non-regulatory issues, such as the differences over funding the
retirement plans, were not critical, although ``it is not
unreasonable to expect each side to have differences over what
caused the failure to reach agreement.''
   The official said he wouldn't rule out renewed merger talks,
``but not in the near term. We might agree to look at it again in
two or three years from now.''
   Industry observers predict that the value of merging was great
enough to possibly inspire the firms to deal with and possibly
overcome the hurdles that scuttled the plan.
   ``I continue to see tremendous benefits to there being a merger
and tremendous negatives to both firms if there is not a merger,''
said James Emerson, publisher of Emerson's Professional Services
Review in Bellevue, Wash.
   A merger would have created the world's largest accounting firm,
reaping $5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and $2.7 billion in
U.S. revenue. Together, the firm would have audited 40 percent of
the Fortune 500 companies.
   Anderson fell to the No. 2 spot among U.S. accounting firms
earlier this year after Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young merged.
Price Waterhouse, founded 100 years ago in London, is the world's
oldest accounting firm.

   Discoveries of new reserves and increases in
exploration spending have helped the nation's ailing petroleum
industry turn toward recovery, according to a study released
Tuesday.
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s 1989 Reserve Disclosures Survey of 244
public petroleum companies said the increases are the first such
significant moves since 1985.
   ``While this is far from a sign that the U.S. oil and gas
industry is about to return to boom times, it does indicate that
many companies have successfully adapted to today's low price
environment,'' said Victor A. Burk, managing director of the
accounting firm's oil and gas industry services.
   Burk said capital expenditures to acquire, explore or develop
oil and gas properties increased in 1988 by 53 percent to $24.6
billion. Capital expenditures fell more than 70 percent from 1984
through 1987.
   In 1988, $5.5 billion of the spending increase _ 65 percent _
was related to surveyed companies acquiring Tenneco's oil and gas
properties. With the Tenneco deal, the acquisitions of proved
properties reached the highest levels since 1984.
   U.S. gas reserves also increased for the first time since 1984
to rise to 103.9 trillion cubic feet (TCF). In 1987, gas reserves
had dropped for the fourth consecutive year, to 103 TCF.
   But in 1988, petroleum companies were able to replace more than
half their oil and gas production through discoveries of new
reserves.
   Burk said the findings show an industry making careful decisions
about its future. ``Management is being very selective in choosing
their development sites,'' he said.
   U.S. exploration and production companies are repositioning by
consolidating operations, stressing technological innovation,
improving operating efficiencies, redirecting exploration and
development activities and investments, and buying and selling
reserves, he said.
   Burk said companies ``continued to drill their best prospects''
and reported the lowest finding cost for new wells of the 1980s at
$7.70 per barrel.
   ``I think we will continue to see improvements in 1989,'' Burk
said. ``Both oil and gas have continued to show improvements over
1988.
   Burk said since Arthur Andersen began compiling data for the
forecasts 10 years ago, many firms have been acquired or simply
gone out of business. In the past five years, he said 36 companies
have dropped from the list of 244 public companies.
   ``I think overall, these are good things _ more positives than
negatives,'' Burk said. ``It certainly will have a positive effect
in the amount of money people will spend in drilling.''
   Meanwhile, Enron Corp. Tuesday released a study that forecast a
natural gas market of 19 to 21 TCF by the year 2000. Arthur
Andersen showed that the leading public companies produced 9.4 TCF
of natural gas in 1988.
   Enron officials said more gas-fired power plants are likely to
be built because of the Bush administration's proposed
environmental incentives for natural gas use.

<HEAD>Adolph Coors' Great Grandsons Break With Tradition By Borrowing Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors' great grandsons broke with a
family tradition of never borrowing money to brew beer when they
decided to buy most of Stroh Brewery Co. for $425 million.
   But tradition is as strong as ever at Coors, where the Coors men
sit down to lunch every day in the dining room of the mansion
Adolph Coors built more than a century ago on the brewery grounds.
   As a 26-year-old immigrant who left Europe to avoid military
service, Adolph Coors founded a modest brewery on the banks of
Clear Creek in 1873, just 14 years after gold-seekers descended on
the area.
   But Coors lacked the gold-seekers' gambling instincts; his
cardinal rules were to brew good beer and stay out of debt doing it.
   Over the years, the founder passed on his cautious, self-reliant
streak to his son, Adolph Coors Jr., and then to the grandsons,
William and Joe Coors. The family business grew into the nation's
fourth-largest brewery.
   The announcement Monday that Coors was going to pay $425 million
for Detroit-based Stroh's brewing assets represented a break with
the past.
   The deal will give Coors 18 Stroh brands, five Stroh breweries
and two can plants. If completed as expected early next year, the
acquisition will boost Coors' annual sales to nearly $3 billion.
Coors would become the nation's No. 3 brewer, behind Anheuser-Busch
and Miller.
   To complete the deal, Coors will have to borrow an estimated
$300 million. And because the Coors family has assiduously avoided
such borrowing throughout its history _ Adolph Coors Co.
traditionally has paid cash when it wanted something _ the company
has no bond rating.
   Still, it is not expected to have trouble finding or repaying
the money.
   ``The company believes in a strong balance sheet. If you have a
strong balance sheet, it enables you to make a move like we have
with Stroh,'' Rob Klugman, vice president of development for Coors
Brewing Co., said Tuesday.
   The Coors family controls 100 percent of Adolph Coors' Class A
voting stock and about a third of its nonvoting, publicly traded
Class B stock.
   The Stroh acquisition is a clear indication that the
fourth-generation Coors brothers _ Peter, Jeff and Joe Jr. _ are
firmly in control one year after the torch was passed by their
uncle, William Coors, and their father, Joe Coors, in a
reorganization.
   All five of Joe Coors' sons attend to family business. While
Peter Coors, 43, runs the beer-brewing operation and was the key
figure in the Stroh deal, Jeff Coors, 44, is president of Adolph
Coors Co., and Joe Coors Jr., 46, the oldest son, is head of Coors
Porcelain Cos.
   The two other brothers, Grover, 39, and John, 33, have lesser
roles in the family business _ Grover heads MicroLithics, a Coors
subsidiary that produces military systems, and John is in charge of
Coors' customer satisfaction division.
   ``Jeff, Joe and I are running the business,'' said Peter Coors,
president of Coors Brewing Co., when asked what role his uncle,
William Coors, 73, the company chairman, and Joe Coors, 72, vice
chairman, continue to play in the firm's day-to-day operations.
   Despite the decision to incur major debt, the Coors family
remains a strong believer in tradition. Every day that business
does not take them out of town, the brothers lunch inside the
22-room Coors mansion, the official family residence on the brewery
grounds that Adolph Coors built.
   That kind of traditionalism over the years has been reflected in
the Coors' politically conservative image, especially concerning
organized labor.
   A year after Brewery Workers union went on strike in 1977 over
Coors' desire to subject its workers to lie-detector tests, Coors
replaced the strikers with non-union employees. That earned the
company the enmity of national labor and triggered a national
consumer boycott by the AFL-CIO that lasted 10 years.
   The boycott ended after Coors pledged not to interfere with
union organizing efforts at Coors, although brewery workers
rejected the Teamsters union in an election in December 1988.
   Joe Coors, a prominent conservative and friend of former
President Ronald Reagan, was an outspoken member of Reagan's
so-called ``kitchen cabinet'' during Reagan's early presidential
years.
   An active supporter of anti-communist causes, Coors also
testified on behalf of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North at the Senate
Iran-Contra hearings. Documents released during those hearings

   OPEC ministers stepped up bargaining Tuesday in a
last-ditch effort to increase the oil cartel's production ceiling
above 19.5 million barrels a day for the rest of 1989 without
sending prices into a freefall.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
three times postponed what was expected to be a final round of
talks to consider a new Iranian proposal. Talks were to resume
Wednesday evening.
   ``It has to cook some,'' Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi
said of the Iranian plan.
   But Libya immediately threw cold water on the idea. ``We will
not accept it,'' insisted a senior Libyan delegate, who demanded
anonymity.
   Earlier, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said his
country had offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in the
last quarter of the year. Iran suggested hiking the cap to between
20.5 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels.
   The ministers talks have centered on raising the production cap
from the current 19.5 million barrel limit to a level between 20
million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, according to
delegates.
   The additional amount under the Iranian plan would be divided
under a formula that would meet the demands of Gabon, the United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Ecuador and Qatar for bigger shares of the
production pie.
   All countries would get larger individual quotas, meaning they
could pump more in the last quarter than now but some would see
their percentage share of the total output shrink.
   ``It seems (there will be) a little increase,'' said a senior
member of one delegation, who demanded anonymity. ``But we still
have different positions. It's a slow process.''
   ``There are some members that are still taking a very hard
line,'' said another delegate, also on condition of anonymity.
   The meeting began Saturday with the delegates arguing over
whether the market was strong enough to absorb an increase in
production without sending prices tumbling.
   The cartel has been overproducing, pumping more crude than
allowed under an output agreement signed in June. Analysts'
estimate OPEC production at about 22 million barrels daily.
   Gasoline prices at the pump were likely to remain about the same
or even fall a few cents in the long term if production were
increased, according to analysts.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was
recently about $1 under the cartel's benchmark of $18 a 42-gallon
barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the major American grade, has been
trading at about $19.50 to $20 a barrel.
   The ministers were reported close to an agreement Monday but ran
into trouble getting all countries to sign on to the deal.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been producing well
beyond their individual quotas in an effort to press their case for
higher shares. Others countries, though, are unwilling to give in
to those two nations and want any increase shared proportionately.
   Analysts say Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been
producing as much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels
each.
   The ministers could extend the current ceiling until the end of
the year. But analysts say that might leave the impression of
disarray in the cartel's ranks. It also could prompt some countries
to widen their taps to take advantage of the firm market.
   OPEC has predicted that demand in the final quarter will be 22
million barrels a day.
   The ministers are to meet again in late November to hammer out a
production pact for the first six months of 1990.
   This week's talks were officially held by a monitoring panel
made up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela. The other OPEC members _ Gabon, Ecuador,
Libya, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ were invited to attend.

   After 17 months of negotiations, flight
attendants at Midway Airlines have ratified their first contract,
union officials said Tuesday.
   The 3-year agreement calls for a base salary of $11,700 a year,
said spokeswoman Darlene Brom. In addition, attendants also could
be paid $1,800 to $5,400 a year in expenses, depending on the
amount of time they are away from home, she said.
   The 650 Midway attendants voted to join the Association of
Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO, in November 1987. Talks on the first
contract began in March 1988 and a federal mediator was called in a
year ago.
   Tentative agreement was reached Aug. 25.
   Midway, a mid-sized carrier based in Chicago, is paying $210
million to buy 16 DC-9 aircraft, as well as gates and other airport
facilities in Philadelphia, Washington and New York from
strikebound Eastern Airlines.

   Attorneys for two leading defense
contractors battling over a canceled, top-secret Navy contract
squared off Tuesday in state court, where they told a judge that
millions of dollars, hundreds of jobs and national security were at
stake.
   Norden Systems Inc., a Norwalk-based subsidiary of United
Technologies Corp., is seeking unspecified damages in excess of
$15,000 in its lawsuit against General Dynamics Corp. of St. Louis.
   Norden filed the breach of contract lawsuit in Stamford Superior
Court in June after General Dynamics dropped it from a program to
develop the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the next generation of Navy
jet fighters.
   General Dynamics is the prime contractor in the $4 billion
project. It had awarded Norden a $114 million subcontract in
January 1988 to develop an in-air radar system for the new fighter
jet.
   An attorney for General Dynamics argued Tuesday that the lawsuit
should be dismissed because it involves top-secret information and
threatens national security. But following two hours of arguments,
Judge Nicholas A. Cioffi recessed the hearing without issuing a
ruling.
   Cioffi said later in his chambers that he needs to research the
case before issuing a written decision. He was unable to say how
long the research might take.
   Herbert L. Fenster, a Washington attorney representing General
Dynamics, said Norden was dropped from the so-called A-12 project
because it was ``failing to make progress'' in developing the radar
system. He said he couldn't prove the claim in court because the
Navy has refused to release necessary documents.
   ``Very little about this contract can be described to the court
since those matters are classified,'' Fenster said.
   The attorney asked Cioffi to dismiss the lawsuit because it
threatens national security. He explained that General Dynamics can
defend itself only by breaking the law and releasing top-secret
documents.
   Cioffi, however, questioned that argument. He said a court case
can be dismissed on national security grounds only at the request
of the federal government, not one of its contractors.
   ``If the government is so concerned, why aren't they here?''
Cioffi asked. Fenster said the Navy hadn't formally sought
dismissal of the case because it doesn't like to take sides in
disputes between contractors. But Norden attorney Peter B. Work of
Washington said the Navy hadn't intervened because it expected the
lawsuit to go forward.
   ``Norden can, and Norden will prove all the claims ... without
classified information,'' Work said.
   He said that when the contract was canceled in April, Norden had
done $50 million worth of work on the radar system, but General
Dynamics had reimbursed it for only $11 million.
   Work said the loss of the contract also forced Norden to dismiss
hundreds of engineers and other workers.

<HEAD>Beer Companies Challenge Coors-Stroh Buyout as Anticompetitive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four beer companies challenged Adolph Coors
Co.'s $425 million buyout of Stroh Brewery Co. on antitrust grounds
Tuesday, saying they would file a federal lawsuit and seek help
from the U.S. Justice Department.
   The buyout of most of Stroh's assets, proposed Monday, would
create a mega-brewery capable of challenging industry giants
Anheuser-Busch Cos. and the Miller Brewing Co. unit of Philip
Morris Cos. Inc., analysts said.
   Coors is the No. 4 beer maker and Stroh No. 3. The merged
company would have annual shipments of 32 million to 36 million
barrels a year, compared with Busch's 80 million barrels and
Miller's 40 million.
   That is too big to suit Pabst Brewing Co., a national brand, and
the regional Falstaff Brewing Co., Pearl Brewing Co. and General
Brewing Co., which together ship 7{ million barrels of beer a year,
or about 3 percent of the market.
   Those companies, which are owned by San Francisco-based S&amp;P
Cos., said the acquisition would violate the Clayton Act and other
federal laws designed to promote competition.
   ``Two of the big boys are getting together to make a bigger
boy,'' William M. Bitting, general counsel for S&amp;P, said from his
Los Angeles office.
   ``It's difficult to compete now and it will be damn near
impossible to compete if this merger goes through,'' Bitting said.
``You'll wind up with no second-tier brewers except for imports,
mom-and-pops, and the microbreweries,'' or tiny specialty brewers.
   He said S&amp;P Cos. would appear at a Justice Department hearing
into the matter Oct. 9, and intended to file at least one lawsuit.
   The merger of Coors and Stroh would be twice as anticompetitive
as allowed under an index the Justice Department uses in
determining whether to join antitrust suits, Bitting maintained.
   Rob Klugman, vice president of development for Coors, declined
to make detailed comment, saying the Golden, Colo.-based company
had not seen ``the language or the basis for the lawsuit.''
   ``In general, it is our belief that this acquisition is
extremely pro-consumer and pro-competitive,'' Klugman said.
   Combining Detroit-based Stroh with Coors would produce a company
with 18.7 percent of the beer market, far ahead of the next, G.
Heileman Brewing Co., which has about a 7 percent share.
   Jay Nelson, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. in New
York, said the combination would mean, among other things, that
Coors could more easily advertise and distribute its products
nationwide.
   The agreement would give Coors most of Stroh Brewing Co.'s
brewing and container facilities and brands.

   Two Philips Industries Inc. shareholders
filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block the $750 million sale of
the company to a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. unit.
   The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court,
contends that Philips shareholders could reap a much higher profit
if other bids were sought for the company before it were sold.
   It also alleges that the takeover came when the building
materials company was poised to increase its earnings and that top
management had failed to tell shareholders the full extent of that
potential.
   The suit was filed by shareholders Thomas Roever of Chicago and
Edith Citron of Palm Beach, Fla., as a class action on behalf of
4,300 stockholders.
   Jessie Philips, the company's founder and chairman, announced
the deal Monday in which MLPI Holdings Inc. will pay $25.50 for
each of Philips' outstanding shares.
   Philips spokesman William Roberts declined comment on the suit.
   The lawsuit, which names Philips and several other company
executives, alleges the deal was undertaken to allow some
defendants to remain as officers of the new company while cashing
out shareholders at an unfair price.
   It called the deal ``an attempt by defendants to aggrandize
their personal and financial positions and interests and to enrich
themselves at the expense of and to the detriment of the public
stockholders.''
   The lawsuit requests an injunction blocking the deal and
unspecified compensatory damages.
   Philips manufactures components for buildings, manufactured
homes, recreational vehicles and the transportation industry. It
has about 10,000 workers in 50 locations in the United States,
Canada and the Netherlands.
   According to the lawsuit, there were more than 28 million shares
of Philips Industries common stock as of June 7. It said Jesse
Philips owns about 1.5 million shares, or 5.4 percent.
   Philips, who earlier this year announced plans to retire, has
said he intends to vote in favor of the stock sale.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. said
Tuesday its board will reconvene Wednesday and may act on a buyout
offer from an unidentified suitor, widely believed to be Japan's
Sony Corp.
   Trading in Columbia stock was active for the second consecutive
session on the reports that Sony had offered about $3 billion for
the film and television producer. The rumored deal also boosted the
prices of stocks of other entertainment companies.
   The deal would be another in a wave of consolidation that has
swept through the entertainment business in recent years as
companies have sought to position themselves to compete in
increasingly accessible global media markets.
   Columbia, Sony and Coca-Cola Co., which owns 49 percent of
Columbia's stock, each declined comment on the published reports
that Sony was offering between $26 and $28 a share for all of
Columbia's common stock. Columbia had about 111 million common
shares outstanding as of May 31.
   Columbia was the most active issue on the New York Stock
Exchange, dropping 12{ cents a share to $26.25 on volume of nearly
4.2 million shares.
   Columbia had jumped $5.25 a share Monday when it disclosed it
was ``in discussions with a third party involving their acquisition
for cash of all of Columbia's outstanding shares.''
   On Tuesday, Columbia said its board had met Monday night to
review those discussions and then adjourned until Wednesday when
``it is anticipated that further action will be taken.''
   Columbia and Sony reportedly have been in talks for months, and
Sony is known to be eager to expand its holdings in the
entertainment field as a complement to its longstanding electronic
hardware business.
   Sony has indicated its interest in buying a movie studio and
Columbia, with a huge library of both films and TV programs could
provide a lucrative new source of revenue for a company that has
specialized in producing the videocassette recorders and other
hardware on which to display those shows.
   Elsewhere in the entertainment group, Paramount Communications
Inc. rose $1.50 a share to $56.25; MCA Inc. climbed $2 a share to
$65.62{ and Orion Pictures Corp. rose 62{ cents a share to $22.75.
   The rumored Sony-Columbia deal ``highlights the scarcity value''
to the remaining independent production companies such as Paramount
and MCA, said Harold Vogel, the entertainment industry analyst for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Mara Balsbaugh, an analyst for Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
said upcoming technology developments by companies like Sony are
likely to expand global demand for programming to the benefit of
companies that have large film and TV libraries. Columbia has a
library of more than 2,700 films and 23,000 TV episodes.
   ``Over time, there is a case for continued consolidation in the
industry. The list of buyers is a lot longer than the list of
sellers,'' she said.
   These and other analysts said it was possible but unlikely that
a third party would emerge with a bid that could scuttle a deal
between Sony and Columbia.
   One potential competitor has taken himself out of the running. A
spokesman for Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. made an unsuccessful
$1.4 billion bid recently for MGM-UA Entertainment Co., said
Tuesday that Murdoch was not interested in getting into the bidding
for Columbia.
   MGM-UA accepted a $1.5 billion buyout offer from the Qintex
Group of Australia earlier this month. Time Inc. is on the verge of
completing its acquisition of Warner Communications Inc., which
owns the Warner Bros. movie studio and the TV production company
Lorimar. News Corp. bought 20th Century Fox three years ago.
   Columbia's Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures studios have
captured 14 percent of the domestic box office revenue this year,
trailing Warner, Disney and Paramount. But industry watchers term
its performance disappointing.
   Its recent films have included ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate
Kid Part III,'' ``Casualties of War'' and ``Lock Up.''
   The New York Times reported in Wednesday editions that movie
producer Peter Guber was expected to replace Victor A. Kaufman as
president and chief executive of Columbia if the Sony buyout is
approved. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,'' ``Rainman,'' and
``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's top producers.
   Columbia has been more successful in TV programming and produces
or distributes 11 series that are being shown in prime time,
including five new series. They include ``Who's the Boss'' and
``Designing Women.''
   It also operates about 820 movie screens in 220 locations.

   The U.S. dollar retreated further against the
Japanese yen during morning trading Wednesday, pressured by central
bank dollar-selling, dealers said.
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were firmer as they
reached a new high.
   The dollar was changing hands at 141.35 yen at late morning,
down 1.45 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.80 yen. After opening at
141.60 yen, the currency ranged from 141.00 to 141.62 yen.
   Currency dealers said the coordinated intervention, conducted by
central banks from Japan, the United States and Canada, followed on
the heels of a wave of central bank action in overseas market
Tuesday, meant to check the dollar's upward trend.
   The amount of intervention was not immediately known, but it
followed similar concerted action by the three central banks Monday.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, does not comment
on its monetary activities.
   ``The concerted intervention represented a firm commitment by
the monetary authorities to contain the dollar's upward move,''
following the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven nations, said a
dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   At the end of the Washington meeting, finance ministers and
central bankers from the United States, Japan, Canada, Britain,
West Germany, France and Italy said in a statement that the
dollar's strength was inconsistent with economic fundamentals.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 93.63 points, or 0.26 percent, closing the morning
session at 35,538.45, a new high. The Nikkei index posted a
484.11-point gain the previous day for a record closing 35,444.82.
   Securities dealers said the market mood remained positive after
Tuesday's advances, but institutional investors were still
cautiously watching the direction of the foreign exchange rates.
   ``The market was further encouraged by the yen's appreciation
against the dollar,'' said a dealer of a major Japanese securities
brokerage who spoke anonymously.

<HEAD>Report: Venezuela Offers New Debt-Reduction Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela has dropped its demands for a 50
percent reduction in its debt to commercial banks and plans to
offer new proposals in an attempt to revive negotiations with the
financial institutions, according to a published report.
   The changes were detailed Monday by Miguel Rodriguez Fandeo,
Venezuela's minister of planning, The New York Times reported in
its Tuesday editions.
   Rodriguez said an agreement was near on a $600 million interim
loan from the banks. The loan would enable the South American
nation to meet some interest payments missed over the last several
months ``in order to create the atmosphere so the negotiating
process could speed up.''
   Rodriguez, interviewed in Washington at the annual meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said the changes
were made to ``accommodate the realities of the banks.'' He was
referring to the different legal and accounting rules in differing
countries.
   He added that Venezuela had not changed its position in response
to moves in the last few weeks by three major U.S. banks to
increase their reserves for bad Third World loans. The moves by the
banks were seen as making it more difficult for Third World debtors
to restructure their debts.
   Instead of its 50 percent reduction in its $21 billion in loans
from commercial banks, a goal the banks rejected, Venezuela will
now offer the banks a broad range of options on debt reduction,
Rodriguez said.
   The options would include reducing the debt by various levels,
starting at 60 percent and going to below the 35 percent level
negotiated in a debt agreement with Mexico. Banks also would have
the option of making new loans, he said.
   Offering various debt reduction levels to different banks would
make it easier to negotiate than trying to reach agreement on one
number among all banks, he said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.72 percent, up from 7.64 percent

$9,606.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the

<TEXT>
   Seaman Furniture Co. says it had agreed in
principle with its banks on a partial repayment plan that would
include a fresh $42 million investment by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., KKR's investors and members of the Seaman family.
   Seaman went private two years ago in a $360 million buyout
arranged by KKR but ran into trouble making debt payments because
of a downturn in its major market, Long Island.
   The troubles of the 31-store furniture chain came as an
embarrassment to KKR by raising questions about how thoroughly it
had investigated Seaman's prospects before backing the buyout.
   The proposal announced Monday would keep Seaman afloat by
slashing and stretching out its debt to banks and giving paper
instead of cash in payments to junk bond holders until 1996.
Creditors would also get an unspecified amount of Seaman's stock.
   The deal requires approval by the holders of 90 percent of its
junk bonds. The banks have already agreed to it in principle,
Seaman said.
   News of the accord boosted the price of Seaman's junk bonds,
which had lost more than 90 percent of their face value. Its junk
bond issue was trading Monday at $110 bid and $140 asked per $1,000
face value, up from about $70 bid before the announcement,
according to Alan Schlesinger, head of junk bond trading at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``The company's in wonderful shape now, especially with the
insertion of the cash,'' Morton Seaman, the chief executive, said
in an interview.
   Seaman said the company has opened five stores in the last 12
months while closing one. A news release said the refinancing will
let it ``continue to aggressively explore new sites in 1990 and
take advantage of the opportunities we see developing.''
   In exchange for $265 million in existing bank debt, banks would
receive $150 million in senior debt, $25 million in subordinated
pay-in-kind notes and a ``substantial amount of equity,'' Morton
Seaman said.
   The pay-in-kind notes would pay interest in the form of more
notes rather than cash until 1996. They would pay interest in cash
from then until they mature in 1999.
   Banks agreed to receive payments of interest but not principal
on $125 million of their debt from now through Nov. 15, 1992. There
would be no payments even of interest on the remaining $25 million
until that date.
   The investors who put in the extra $42 million would receive
senior subordinated notes. The share that each of the investors
would put in was not specified.
   Owners of Seaman's roughly $83 million in outstanding junk bonds
would get $20.8 million face value of new pay-in-kind notes and 8
percent of the stock in Seaman in exchange for 90 percent of those
junk bonds. The terms of those pay-in-kind notes were not specified.

<HEAD>Record $187.1 Billion in Bonds Issued in First Three Quarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record $187.1 billion in debt securities was
issued to the public in the first three quarters of this year as
interest rates dropped, according to a survey.
   Securities Data Co., in a preliminary survey released Monday for
the first nine months, noted that, on the other hand, the volume of
common stock brought to market fell sharply. The survey covers Jan.
1 through Sept. 20.
   The volume of Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued
jumped to $187.1 billion during the first three quarters, up from
$181.4 billion in the same period last year and surpassing the
previous nine-month record of $184.2 billion in the first three
quarters of 1987.
   The sales were stimulated by falling interest rates, Securities
Data noted. When interest rates decline, bond prices rise.
   The rate on the Treasury's key 30-year bond, for example, has
fallen from 9.08 percent on Jan. 3, the first trading day of the
year, to 8.23 percent in early trading Monday. The yield on the
closely watched bond dropped on Aug. 2 to 7.84 percent, its lowest
level since April 1987.
   While the total volume of bonds issued expanded, ``junk'' bonds
fared poorly during the period, the consulting firm said. It blamed
the recent shakeout in the junk bond market for the smallest number
of the high-risk, high-yield bonds being issued since 1984.
   Ninety-five junk bond offerings were made during the first nine
months, down from 115 in the same period last year. The total
volume of junk bonds offered was nearly stable, at $19.28 billion
compared with $19.36 billion in 1988. But around $4 billion of this
year's volume was accounted for by the $24.53 billion leveraged
buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc., noted Francine Wissak, an assistant
vice president of Securities Data.
   New issues of common stock also turned in a lackluster
performance, according to the survey. Although the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials soared during the period, surpassing the
2,700 level, common stock issued raised only $13.5 billion, down
from $23.8 billion in the first nine months of 1988.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. continued to be the leading manager of
new bond and stock issues with 17 percent of the market, according
to the survey.

   A new appliance that can chill beer, keep ice
cream frozen and cook pizza has college students clamoring, and the
inventor, a former computer salesman, crossing his fingers.
   The Microfridge, offered by Microfridge Inc. of the Boston
suburb of Sharon, is a three-piece appliance composed of a compact
refrigerator, a separate freezer compartment and a mini-microwave.
The product retails for $429.
   The company founders did more than stack three appliances on top
of one another and paint them the same color, however. Their
machine, which stands under four feet tall, was invented to use no
more power than a compact refrigerator.
   ``Quite simply, when one unit is running, the other one is
off,'' explained co-founder Robert P. Bennett, 33, who said he
holds two patents on the Microfridge's circuitry.
   When the microwave is turned on, the freezer and refrigerator
shut off temporarily, and resume when the cooking is done, Bennett
said. Product testing showed that even when the microwave was on
for 45 minutes, the refrigerator and freezer sections gained only
three degrees, he said.
   The first shipment of 1,700 Microfridges went out at the end of
August, and the company plans two more shipments by the end of
November. Sales are expected to top $1.9 million this year, Bennett
said, and ``the phones are still ringing.''
   Microfridge has three distributors, which sell the appliance
through colleges, military bases and some retail stores. The
device, whose components are made in various countries, is
assembled in San Diego by the U.S. arm of Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd.,
the Japanese electronics and appliance giant.
   ``The biggest problem is going to be eventually we'll have to
think about competition, '' said Bennett. ``Once we create a
market, either we'll have built up until we're the recognized name,
or we won't have _ that will allow someone else to come in.''
   For now, the efforts of Bennett and his co-founders, Peter
Soriano, 47, and Ed Ward, 37, are focused on promoting the
appliance for use in schools, hotels, office suites and military
bases.
   More than 88 percent of the first shipment was bought by
colleges and their students, Bennett said. And students are forming
waiting lists at Brown University in Rhode Island and the
University of Southern California.
   Joseph Zannini, the executive director of housing at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, says the school ordered 11
Microfridges for initial testing, welcoming the reduced power
requirements.
   Lauren Massara, a freshman at Brown University, raved about her
Microfridge.
   ``I think it could almost be considered a necessity if you're
not on the three-meal plan. You can make breakfast, Eggo Waffles,''
she said. Because of the Microfridge in her room, Massara plans to
go off the full-meal plan, she said.
   Relying too much on the relatively small college market could
ultimately sink Microfridge Inc., said Chuck Ryan, an industry
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Ryan also said the retail price was
high enough to be a probable stumbling block.
   ``I think he's got a difficult sale on a price basis, because
college students can buy a $99 refrigerator and a $99 microwave and
save yourself a lot of money,'' said Ryan.
   According to Bennett, however, a separate freezer makes up for
that price difference.
   ``How much is the freezer worth? That's really the question. And
because we have an extremely high backlog, it seems to be worth
quite a lot,'' he said.
   Marassa agreed. ``You don't have to worry about this teensy
space not big enough to hold ice cubes,'' she said, referring to
the minute freezer compartment of most compact refrigerators. ``I
mean, this can hold ice cream.''

<HEAD>Coors Bid for Stroh To Create `Big Three' Brewery Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A $425 million agreement in principle for
Adolph Coors Co. to buy the No. 3-ranked Stroh Brewing Co.'s brands
and breweries sets up a ``Big Three'' among U.S. beer makers,
analysts said.
   Coors president Peter Coors on Monday announced his company's
plans to acquire most of Stroh's assets and send a message to No. 1
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and No. 2 Miller Brewing that Coors is the
one to be watched.
   ``Clearly we are in the beer business,'' said Coors, head of the
No. 4 brewer in the nation. ``If we are going to be in the beer
business long-term, we've got to be a major and significant
competitor.''
   Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. in New
York, said the sale will result in a ``Big Three'' of U.S. brewing.
   Combining Detroit-based Stroh and Golden-based Coors would
produce a company with 18.7 percent of the market, a tougher
competitor for the top two and far ahead of the next, G. Heileman
Brewing Co., which has about a 7 percent share.
   Jay Nelson of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., also of New York,
said that while the acquisition is ``not a sure thing'' _ it still
faces several hurdles _ the combination would mean Coors would
compete better and benefit from economies of scale, distribution
and purchasing.
   ``You may have more clout all along the line, more bang for the
buck in advertising, and more bang for the buck in general,'' he
said.
   ``I think the price is a good one for Coors' standpoint. It
looks cheap on the basis of replacement value of the breweries, and
they're getting ongoing brands. Those brands are not generating a
lot of income, but consumers are buying them and there's some
potential there,'' Nelson said.
   Coors officials said they expect to take nearly 20 percent of
the beer market with the Stroh acquisition, and become stronger not
only from a business standpoint, but from a consumer standpoint.
   The agreement would give Coors most of Stroh Brewing Co.'s
brewing and container facilities and brands.
   ``Stroh Brewing Co. will continue to exist, but the operating
company will not,'' Coors said. Golden will be headquarters for the
entire operation.
   The purchase by Coors would be paid in part by the assumption of
long-term debt and other selected liabilities, with the balance
paid in cash. Coors would not disclose the amount of either.
   The plan would give Coors the following brands: Stroh's and
Stroh's Light; Signature; Schlitz, Schlitz Light and Schlitz Malt
Liquor; Schaefer Light and Schaefer non-alcohol and low-alcohol
brands; Old Milwaukee and Old Milwaukee Light; Red Bull; Silver
Thunder; and St. Barts, a non-alcohol brand; as well as the
licensing rights to Piels, Piels Light and Augsburger.
   Coors said he did not know which brands would be retained and
which discarded.
   Primo, a Stroh beer brewed in Hawaii and distributed in some
West Coast cities, is not included, and neither is Sundance, a wine
cooler. Stroh also bottles other wine coolers and drinks that are
not included, the chairman said.
   The move is part of a drive begun in the early 1980s by Coors to
expand from a regional to a national brewer. The company now sells
its products in 49 states and Washington, D.C.
   Coors has 10 beer brands. Its main labels are Coors and Coors
Light.
   Stroh has been suffering its worst financial troubles since it
went national by acquiring Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in 1982.
   Stroh was unable to make inroads on the growth of Anheuser
Busch, which dominates the industry with a 41 percent share of the
national beer market, far ahead of Miller's 21 percent and Stroh's
11 percent. Miller is a unit of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
   The 139-year-old Stroh has been looking for potential partners
since February and announced Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its
1,500 white-collar employees nationwide. Chairman Peter Stroh said
the cuts were being made because the family-owned company had been
unable to find a partner.
   Stroh also cut back support of civic and industry affairs and
advertising, including auto racing sponsorships.
   Coors' would acquire Stroh plants in St. Paul, Minn.; Tampa,
Fla.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; Longview, Texas; and Allentown, Pa.
   Can plants to be acquired are in Winston-Salem and Longview.
   Stroh also has breweries in Memphis, Tenn., and Van Nuys,
Calif., that will not be acquired, Coors said.
   Stroh plants are represented by the Teamsters, while Coors
workers rejected representation by the Teamsters last December.
``We've been in touch with the Teamsters and will want to develop a
relationship with them,'' Coors said.
   The transaction is subject to the negotiation of a definitive
agreement, approval by the boards of directors of both companies,
and review by the Justice Department, Coors said. Closing is not
expected before early next year.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Queries United On Buyout</HEAD>

   The government is asking United Airlines to
disclose how much foreign influence over the airline a planned
employee-management takeover would allow, officials said.
   The inquiry came as The Wall Street Journal reported that
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner had asked Northwest
Airlines' new principle owner, Alfred Checchi, to cut by $225
million the $400 million investment made in NWA Inc., the airline's
parent corporation, by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
   The Transportation Department on Monday gave Steven M. Wolf,
chairman of United parent UAL Corp., until Oct. 10 to furnish
information on investors and financial arrangements in the $6.5
billion stock buyout plan of UAL by the airline's pilots,
management and British Airways PLC. Wolf is to continue as head of
the company under the plan, which would give controlling interest
to United employees.
   Jeffrey N. Shane, assistant transportation secretary for policy
and international affairs, asked Wolf to provide detailed financial
information, including the names of any foreign investors and the
amount of influence they might have over the new company.
   The department is conducting a financial fitness review of the
United deal to determine whether it will extend the airline's
operating certificate under the new ownership. A similar review of
the Northwest takeover was completed last week but the results were
not announced to the public.
   ``We are concerned about any aquisition,'' Shane said in the
letter to United, ``especially a leverage buyout of either the
carrier or its parent that could have a substantial adverse impact
on a carrier's financial structure, might otherwise affect its
ability to operate safely or meet its financial obligations, or
would result in its not being controlled by U.S. citizens.''
   On the Northwest takeover, department spokesman Hal Paris said
he could not confirm the Journal report or give any details of the
department's decision on the buyout.
   KLM made its investment in NWA to help Checchi finance the $3.65
billion purchase. KLM provided 57 percent of the $700 million in
equity Checchi raised to buy Northwest but owns only 5 percent of
the airline.
   Foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a U.S.
airline, but Skinner said last week he was concerned that foreign
investors might have more influence than their ownership reflects
and could compromise U.S. negotiations with other governments over
air routes.
   The Journal also reported that rumors about possible changes in
KLM's Northwest investment sparked a sell-off of stock in United
Airlines' parent corporation.
   British Airways plans to invest $750 million in UAL.
   The department, in its letter to United, asked for a
``citizenship affidavit'' for UAL as it will exist after the
takeover.
   ``Detail any actual or potential ability on the part of these
non-citizen entities to influence or control, directly or
indirectly, the affairs of United,'' Shane instructed in the letter.
   He also asked for any written or oral agreements that might
assure that non-citizen lenders cannot control UAL.
