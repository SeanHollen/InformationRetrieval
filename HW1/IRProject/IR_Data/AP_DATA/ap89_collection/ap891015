   Wall Street braced for a possible battering
Monday as aftershocks from its Friday the 13th plunge sent stocks
and the dollar tumbling in Tokyo and other foreign exchanges before
they steadied in later trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues finished the morning
session on the Tokyo Stock Exchange down 407.84 points, or 1.16
percent, from Friday's finish at 34,708.18. The average opened down
about 600 points but later rose in light-volume trading.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo at 139.95 yen, down sharply from
Friday's closes of 144.00 yen in Tokyo and 142.05 yen in New York,
but by late morning was quoted at 141.30 yen.
   Yozo Asai, an analyst with the brokerage Yamaichi Securities in
Tokyo, said there was some panic selling at the start of trading
but the stock market was returning to stability.
   ``Market players in Japan learned their lesson from Black Monday
two years ago, so there will be no panic selling any more,'' Asai
said.
   Market and government officials in the United States continued
their weekend-long huddle Sunday, mapping out strategies to prevent
a financial disaster paralleling the events of two years ago, when
the Dow plummeted 508 points on Oct. 19, Black Monday, after a
108-point drop the preceding Friday.
   ``After what happened ... the powers that be will do a lot to
avoid a major sell-off,'' said John Tierney, a vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The Tokyo activity was the first in a major foreign market
following Friday's plunge on Wall Street and was expected to help
set the tone for trading as it opened in other markets around the
world.
   Share prices in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan
also fell, but not drastically, in opening trading Monday.
   On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, prices declined about 6
percent, or 163 points to 2,619 in the first 10 minutes of trading.
On the New Zealand exchange, blue-chip stocks tracked by the
Barclays Index ended the morning off 265 points _ 11.79 percent _
at 1984.85, the biggest fall since the 505 points of the October
1987 crash. Australia's main stock price index fell 8 percent in
the first 20 minutes of trading but finished the morning down about
7 percent from Friday.
   In Taiwan, the market's weighted index was down about 1.3
percent in late morning activity, after initially declining by 2
percent.
   The New York stock market suffered its worst setback since the
Black Monday crash when prices plunged in the final hour of trading
last Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 190
points to finish at 2,569.26.
   Since 1987, takeover rumors and leveraged buyouts had pushed the
market higher. But trouble with one of those deals Friday, the
employee-management buyout of United Airines parent UAL Corp.,
raised fears of problems in the ``junk bond'' financing market and
sparked Friday's sell-off.
   The Federal Reserve sent signals over the weekend that it will
move quickly to meet any demands for cash on Monday, when a deluge
of sell orders is expected to hit the U.S. markets.
   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that is
needed,'' said a senior Fed official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``If there are any doubts about liquidity being
available, there is no reason to be concerned.''
   The Fed's action could keep bankers from cutting off credit to
brokerage houses and securities firms suffering heavy losses from a
plunge in stock prices.
   The Fed official said the U.S. central bank had been in touch
with central banks in Japan and Europe and had received assurances
from them that those officials stood ready to supply needed cash in
their countries to counteract any possible fallout from Friday's
plunge in stock prices.
   Officials at both the Fed and the Treasury were closely
monitoring developments in the overseas markets, primarily Tokyo
and Hong Kong. Developments in those markets could set the tone for
how U.S. markets perform when they open Monday morning.
   The New York Stock Exchange planned to open its computers to
receive orders at 7:30 a.m. EDT, an hour earlier than usual.
Thousands of worried investors called sell orders into their
brokers over the weekend, setting the stage for a flood of activity
when Wall Street opens for business.
   The exchange plans to institute a service at the opening, which
puts individual orders of up to 2,099 shares in front of big,
institutional orders, said the NYSE's chief spokesman Richard
Torrenzano. Normally, the service is offered only after the Dow
moves up or down 25 points.
   ``You go on a red alert when there's a situation like Friday,''
said NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin. ``We want to pave the way for
the system to operate as smooth as possible. We're not anticipating
any problem.''
   Once the market opens, a system of ``circuit breakers''
installed following the 1987 crash will automatically halt trading
if the Dow rises or falls 250 points.
   Gamsin said the exchange intends to let the market ``go,''
rather than step in before the circuit breakers have a chance to
work.
   Insiders say a drop on Wall Street might be cushioned if
corporations and brokerages step in to buy stocks. After the crash
two years ago, companies stepped in to purchase their own shares to
bolster prices.
   Observers said the same thing could happen this time, with
brokerages joining in to support the stocks they have been touting
through the market's recent record-setting runup.
   Experts are quick to note that the economic landscape two years
ago was markedly different. Higher interest rates and a weak dollar
had the effect of ``creating expectations of a big economic
slowdown'' and looming inflation, Tierney said.
   But lower interest rates, a strong dollar and continued growth
are providing a firmer foundation this time around.
   ``People (have had) two days to sober to the fact that the
economy is not falling apart,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice
president at First Albany Corp.

   The Oakland Athletics, showing the
pitching and power that made them baseball's winningest team,
dismissed the San Francisco Giants 5-0 Saturday night in the World
Series opener.
   Dave Stewart pitched a five-hitter for his third postseason
victory this year. He walked one and struck out six.
   Oakland roughed up National League earned run average leader
Scott Garrelts for five runs in four innings.
   Dave Parker and Walt Weiss each homered and the Athletics
finished with 11 hits, including three by Mark McGwire.
   Rickey Henderson, the most valuable player in the American
League playoffs, went 2-for-5 with a run-scoring single but did not
steal a base after swiping a record eight in the playoffs. Will
Clark, the National League playoff MVP, went 2-for-4.
   Stewart, throwing 95 mph fastballs at twilight, had trouble only
on balls hit back to him.
   Stewart made a two-base throwing error on Robby Thompson's
comebacker in the first inning. In the third, Jose Uribe got an
infield hit when Stewart failed to cleanly catch the ball and threw
a shade late to first base.
   Dave Henderson walked on five pitches to start the second and
one-out singles by Terry Steinbach and Tony Phillips made it 1-0.
   With runners at first and third, Weiss nubbed a slow grounder to
first that Clark fielded, double-pumped and threw home to Terry
Kennedy. Steinbach, however, kicked the ball loose from his rival
catcher's mitt for an error and was safe.
   Rickey Henderson singled home another run for a 3-0 lead.
   Parker homered to open the third and Weiss homered to lead off
the fourth.

   Violent thunderstorms ripped across upstate
New York Saturday with heavy rain, hail and wind up to 85 mph,
knocking out power to thousands of homes and killing at least one
person.
   A man was killed and three other people, including two boys,
were slightly injured when their mobile home was blown several
hundred feet from its foundation in McDonough, police said.
   A Canfield, Ohio, man escaped injury when a gust of wind blew
his single-engine Cessna aircraft onto its side as he was preparing
for takeoff from Niagara Falls International Airport, police said.
   A sky diver who was aloft when the storm hit was yanked upward
1,500 feet in three seconds, said Niagara County Sheriff's Deputy
Duane Jacobs.
   The parachutist, David Konstabel, 32, of West Seneca, told
police that when he hit the ground, he was dragged 300 feet across
a barbed-wire fence and into some trees in the town of Newfane.
   Konstabel was reported in stable condition with injuries to his
right leg in Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo.
   After Konstabel began ascending he cut his main parachute away
and descended using his reserve chute, said Henry Szczepanski,
sky-diving instructor for Konstabel's group.
   ``This thing just came across the lake and whacked us,''
Szczepanski said of the storm.
   Thousands of homes were left without electricity when power
lines were downed from the Niagara Frontier to the Vermont state
line.
   Winds reached as much as 85 mph in Ithaca, and in nearby Lansing
the roof was blown off an apartment building, said Tompkins County
Sheriff's dispatcher Julie Morehouse.
   Two people were hurt.

   A tour bus full of weekend gamblers flipped on
its side on a rain-slickened highway in downtown Las Vegas on
Saturday. Forty-two people were injured, none seriously,
authorities said.
   The Scorpio Tours bus was carrying passengers from Southern
California when it crashed in the northbound lane of Interstate 15
at about 4 p.m.
   Driver Jose Luis Figuearera, 51, said through an interpreter he
lost control when he braked for a car in front of him, officials
said. They said the bus fell on its left side.
   ``I just saw a lot of cars getting tangled up. Then I saw a
cloud of dust and the bus was in the middle of the cloud of dust
and then it just went over on its side,'' said Malcolm Turner, a
Clark County firefighter who was driving home when he saw the crash.
   A tractor-trailer rig following the bus also swerved out of
control and collided with a car, but no injuries were reported. It
was raining lightly.
   Passengers escaped through a rooftop escape hatch and the
driver's broken windshield.
   The driver and 41 passengers were taken to five hospitals. The
worst injury reported was a broken pelvis, said Robert Forbuss,
president of Mercy Ambulance.
   Listed on the back of the bus were two Southern California phone
numbers for Scorpio Tours. Victor Enciso, who answered a phone call
made to a Claremont number, said Scorpio Tours was owned by his
aunt, Angelina Rodriguez.
   A woman who answered at the number he gave said Angelina
Rodriguez had been in a traffic accident in the Los Angeles area
and was unavailable. There were no phone listings for Scorpio Tours
in Glendora, Claremont or Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Oregon Senator Will Seek Fifth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRAD CAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SILVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declaring that he has an ``unfinished
agenda,'' U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield said Saturday night that he would
run for a fifth term.
   The announcement by the Oregon Republican ended months of
speculation about the plans of the state's most popular politician.
   ``I've come to the conclusion that ours is an unfinished
agenda,'' Hatfield said told about 350 supporters.
   Hatfield said he played a key role in fashioning the recent
congressional compromise on harvest of old growth timber.
Environmentalists had initally opposed harvesting any virgin timber
on federal land; the compromise allows some logging.
   ``I will not rest until we have secured a long-term solution to
our timber supply problems,'' Hatfield said.
   Hatfield, 67, also said that if re-elected he would work to
provide better health care to Oregonians, to step up the fight
against drugs, and to slow the nuclear arms race.
   Following a long-standing tradition, Hatfield made the
announcement in Silverton, where he's launched all of his previous
campaigns.
   Friends and political supporters of Hatfield, including
President Bush, had encouraged the senator to run again.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat, also asked him to run again.
   Hatfield won a seat in the Oregon House in 1950 and was elected
secretary of state in 1956. After two terms as governor, he was
elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966.
   A formal Naval officer who was one of the first Americans to
witness firsthand the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima,
Hatfield earned a reputation as a staunch foe of the Vietnam war.

<HEAD>Union Official Charges ``Witch Hunt'' By Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union official said Saturday that allegations
that Pan American World Airways ticket agents kept ticket money are
part of a ``witch hunt'' by the airline.
   Four ticket agents at Kennedy International Airport have been
charged with stealing about $1,400, said Bill Cahill, a spokesman
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the
airport.
   ``The Port Authority and Pan Am have determined that $48,000 is
in fact missing,'' said Cahill.
   He said Port Authority detectives are investigating the four
agents and and possibly others in the disappearance of the $48,000.
   Cahill had previously indicated that the four arrested were
charged with stealing the total $48,000, but he said Saturday he
was mistaken.
   The four agents were charged Friday with falsifying records and
larceny for allegedly selling one-way tickets and keeping the cash
instead of putting the money in the register, Cahill said.
   One of the agents, Cathy Alam, is charged with taking just $38,
Cahill said.
   An official of the union that represents the agents blasted the
charges, calling it part of a scheme by Pan Am to get rid of some
union employees.
   ``I think this is just a witch hunt,'' said George Miranda, vice
president of Local 732 of the airline division of the Teamsters.
   ``I don't think these people were involved in a sophisticated
scam involving that amount of money,'' Miranda said.
   Cahill said $48,000 is missing in receipts for August and
September and that Port Authority detectives believe ticket agents
may have been keeping cash payments for about a year.
   The investigation, conducted at the request of the airline, will
continue and more arrests are expected, Cahill said.
   A Pan Am spokesman didn't immediately respond to a telephone
request for comment.

<HEAD>British Daily Reports U.S. Soft On Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is unable to get rid of
Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega because the military strongman has
compromising films involving senior Washington officials, a British
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Sunday Correspondent, a new independent weekly, also said
the United States asked Noriega for help shipping arms to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels, according to secret documents
declassified during the Iran-Contra investigation.
   ``The United States' relationship with the general is curious
and raises disturbing questions,'' the paper said.
   The newspaper said that for years Noriega invited senior
officials from Congress, the CIA, the Defense Department and
administration to his Pacific Ocean villa on the Azuero Peninsula.
It didn't name any officials.
   There, he supplied his guests with girls or boys in bedrooms
wired for sound and equipped with hidden cameras, the paper said.
   Noriega stored the films ``as an insurance policy for the
future,'' according to the newspaper.
   The weekly quoted Curtin Winsor, U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica
from 1983 to 1985, as saying he received such an invitation from
Noriega's brother in 1985.
   Winsor told the paper he checked out the invitation with Ted
Briggs, U.S. ambassador to Panama, who told him he would be
spending the weekend in ``one of the most notorious `honey-traps'
in Latin America.''
   The report said Winsor turned down his invitation but many other
U.S. officials accepted.
   ``I can't give you names, but look around,'' the weekly quoted
Winsor as saying. ``Who's soft on Noriega? That's where you should
look.''
   The newspaper quoted Dick Gregorie, the former Miami prosecutor
who brough drug-trafficking charges against Noriega, as saying he
was disgusted by what he called the sham nature of the U.S. war on
drugs.
   The newspaper said documents released during the Iran-Contra
trials showed the U.S. wanted permission to use Noriega's ``secret
drugs and arms airfields.''
   Jack Blum, former counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, was quoted by the paper as saying, ``If drugs came back
to the U.S. as a result then the U.S. administration turned a blind
eye.''
   The paper also quoted Blum as saying the United States gave
Noriega ``all kinds of mixed signals,'' a mixture of public
condemnation and private encouragement.
   Blum told the paper that a 1986 State Department policy review
recommending strong action against Noriega was shelved after
``higher levels'' told the department to forget it.
   The paper said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., requested last year
that the General Accounting Office ask government agencies for
information on Noriega. The National Security Council, however,
banned any agency from giving out information, the paper said.
   The Sunday Correspondent is only five weeks old. It is not
connected with any other British newspaper group but the Chicago
Tribune Company is among its financial backers.

<HEAD>Babbitt Says Keating Called for Aid in 1985</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt said Saturday that
American Continental Corp. Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr.
contacted him in 1985 to ask him to intercede on Keating's behalf
against the nation's top thrift regulator.
   ``Keating called me and said, `Edwin Gray (then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board) is getting on my back ... I want you
to intervene,''' Babbitt said. ``I refused.''
   Keating declined to comment on the matter involving Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., an American
Continental subsidiary that was at the time at odds with the Bank
Board.
   Babbitt, who left office early in 1987 to seek the Democratic
nomination for president, said Keating called only once. He said he
was unaware at the time that other Arizona politicians had received
similar requests from Keating.
   Babbitt made his remarks to about 100 people at a Phoenix
meeting sponsored by the citizens lobby Common Cause.
   American Continental filed for federal bankruptcy protection
April 13, and the government took over Lincoln the next day.
   The thrift's failure, which regulators blame in part on risky
ventures, eventually could cost taxpayers $1.1 billion to $2.5
billion.
   In 1985, Gray and Keating were battling over Gray's support for
a regulation that put strict limits on the amount of assets thrifts
were allowed to invest directly in real estate, securities and
other risky ventures without regulators' approval.
   Babbitt said he received one political contribution from Keating
in 1982 but none during his presidential candidacy.

<TEXT>
   A real estate developer is getting some help from
the Feds in his quest to transform Al Capone's former headquarters,
once an opulent palace of sin, into a respectable hotel for
business travelers.
   The Lexington Hotel, on Chicago's Near South Side, was the plush
Prohibition Era haven where Capone ruled his criminal empire in the
late 1920s and early '30s, before he was sent to federal prison on
an income tax-evasion rap.
   Today, the abandoned building is a neighborhood eyesore, despite
its city and federal landmark status.
   Broken liquor bottles litter the boarded-up main entrance, next
to an abandoned blues bar. The masonry exterior is dotted with
cracked terra cotta decorations and broken bay windows.
   Real estate developer Ganesan Visvabharathy wants to change all
that.
   The Indian-born Visvabharathy plans to transform the 10-story
building into a 258-suite hotel geared to business people attending
events at the nearby McCormick Place exhibition center.
   Visvabharathy said he didn't know about the hotel's past when he
responded to a real estate ad in June 1988. He bought the property
for $600,000 from the Sunbow Foundation, a non-profit group that
trains women for construction jobs.
   But Visvabharathy said Capone's legacy was an added incentive
for him to proceed with plans for the $28.6 million rehabiliation
project.
   ``A lot of people would consider Al Capone something like a
negative, but in my opinion that's exactly why you should use it as
a positive thing to market the hotel,'' said Visvabharathy in a
recent interview.
   ``If you go anywhere in the world, people may not know anything
about Chicago, but they know Al Capone,'' said Visvabharathy, 41,
who left India in 1974 to study for his doctorate in business
administration at the University of Illinois.
   Last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
awarded an Urban Development Action Grant to the Lexington rehab
project. The $2.6 million grant will be used by the city to make a
low-interest loan to Vilas Investment Properties Inc., the real
estate development company Visvabharathy started in 1982.
   A partnership formed by Vilas' company is investing $3 million
and the remainder of the money will come from bank loans and city
development bonds.
   Visvabharathy plans to begin construction in late November, and
the restoration should be completed by November 1991.
   Joseph J. James, the commissioner of the city's Department of
Economic Development, says he's excited about the project.
   ``It will breathe some new life into a neighborhood that we are
very interested in,'' James said. ``If we can facilitate some
tourism and interest using one of our more notorious former
residents ... I can certainly live with that.''
   The Lexington opened in 1892 and was one of the city's first
high-rises. President Grover Cleveland honeymooned there and
society's elite once danced on the lavish ballroom's tiled floors.
   When Capone made the hotel his headquarters, he occupied the
fourth and fifth floors. Part of the hotel was converted to a
brothel, and there was a network of underground tunnels and secret
stairways.
   The Lexington was renamed the New Michigan Hotel after World War
II. A bordello and finally a flophouse, it was closed by court
order in 1980.
   Visvabharathy says little is salvagable inside _ except for some
tile flooring from the ballroom and tiles in the bathroom of
Capone's four-room suite.
   He plans to faithfully restore Capone's suite, including its
lavender bathtub, but it won't be rented out to guests. Instead, it
will be a tourist attraction.
   In 1986, the Lexington drew attention when television's Geraldo
Rivera blasted open a sealed basement chamber billed as Capone's
secret vault in a live TV broadcast. All that was found were a few
empty whiskey bottles and an old sign.

   Walter Sisulu, senior leader of the
African National Congress and colleague of Nelson Mandela, was
freed at dawn Sunday after 26 years in prison. Seven other
political prisoners also were freed.
   Mandela, the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed
guerrilla movement, remains in prison, although his release within
the next months is widely expected.
   Sisulu, 77, arrived under police escort at his home in Soweto
and embraced his wife, Albertina, an activist who was under severe
police restrictions until Friday.
   Youths who had been waiting for Sisulu lifted the white-haired,
bespectacled black nationalist atop their shoulders before he went
inside.
   ``I feel very well,'' Sisulu told reporters. ``I am inspired.''
   Also freed early Sunday were the seven other prisoners whose
impending unconditional release was announced Tuesday by President
F.W. de Klerk.
   These include four other men arrested in 1963 and sentenced to
life prison terms in 1964 along with Sisulu and Mandela _ Andrew
Mlangeni, 63, Elias Mostsoaledi, 65, Ahmed Kathrada, 60, and
Raymond Mhlaba, 68, as well as ANC leader, Wilton Mkwayi, 67, who
was sentenced to life in prison in a separate 1964 trial.
   The group also includes 80-year-year ANC activist Oscar Mpetha,
who had been hospitalized in Cape Town, and Jafta Masemola, 58, a
member of the Pan Africanist Congress guerrilla movement who lives
outside Pretoria.
   Mpetha was serving a five-year prison term for terrorism.
Masemola was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1963.
   Sisulu, who arrived home in a gray suit and blue tie, emerged
after about three hours to speak to reporters and give a
clenched-fist salute to a crowd of 300 well-wishers outside his
home, some waving ANC flags.
   Asked if he had feared he might die in prison, Sisulu said: ``I
was quite prepared for death. But I knew the pressure was building
for our release, and I never despaired.''
   Sisulu conferred at his home with several anti-apartheid leaders.
   The freed ANC leaders are expected to apply for passports to
travel to Lusaka, Zambia, for consultations with the guerrilla
movement's exiled leadership.
   Although the ANC remains outlawed, the release of Sisulu and his
colleagues has been widely viewed as a tacit acknowledgement by the
government of the movement's influence and popularity among South
Africa's black majority.
   Even relatively conservative black leaders have said they will
reject any negotiations with the government unless the ANC is
legalized and its jailed leaders freed.
   In recent weeks, the government has permitted ANC flags and
posters to be displayed openly at mass protests, something not
allowed before de Klerk took power in mid-August.
   Symbols of the guerrilla movement were in evidence Saturday,
when more than 100,000 blacks joined in marches mationwide
protesting government policy and celebrating the imminent release
of the eight prisoners.
   Organizers said never before had so many large anti-government
marches been held in the country simultaneously.
   Mandela, 71, conferred with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and
other government officials before the announcement of the prisoner
releases. There has been increasing speculation that Mandela does
not want to go free until the government takes further steps to
legalize ANC political activity.
   ``The ANC leader clearly understands the power he wields,''
wrote political analysist Gary Van Staden in The Star newspaper of
Johannesburg on Sunday. ``If, by remaining in jail, he can achieve
the unbanning of his and other organizations and strengthen the
ANC's position in the negotiation process, then his own history
suggests he will opt for the tough choice.''
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five
years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised
black majority, but he envisions some arrangement in which whites
would retain veto power over major decisions.
   Black leaders say meaningful talks cannot begin until the state
of emergency is lifted, the ANC is legalized and all political
prisoners are freed.

<HEAD>Hawaii Bishop Calls Marcos Eulogy Absurd and Insulting</HEAD>

   A eulogy comparing Ferdinand Marcos to Jesus
Christ was ``ridiculous, absurd and an insult to the Filipino
people,'' Hawaii's top Roman Catholic official said Saturday.
   ``I sincerely regret the gross abuse of the Catholic Mass as a
forum to make yet another blatantly political statement regarding
the late Ferdinand Marcos, former president of the Philippines,''
the Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu, Joseph A. Ferrario, said in
a written statement.
   During a funeral Mass Friday at the Co-Cathedral of St. Theresa,
Monsignor Domingo Nebres, a priest from the Philippines, eulogized
his longtime friend as a man who suffered like Jesus Christ and
forgave those who betrayed him.
   ``Christ was a victim of the people's power, so Marcos was a
victim of the people's power,'' he said, referring to the 1986
``people power'' revolt that ended Marcos' 20-year rule in the
Philippines.
   After the Mass, Nebres told reporters he was not comparing
Marcos to Jesus in terms of power, but in suffering.
   Ferrario said Nebres, who doesn't have a Honolulu parish, was
allowed to say the Mass only after agreeing he wouldn't to give a
eulogy or say anything political.
   ``He gave us his word that he would follow these directions. His
comments at the Mass violated these instructions,'' said Ferrario.
``Furthermore, we consider his comparison of Marcos to Jesus as
ridiculous, absurd and an insult to the Filipino people.''
   Nebres defended himself Saturday, saying his comments were
personal, not political, and that he spoke only of Marcos'
suffering, especially during his three-year exile.
   As for the instructions against giving a eulogy, Nebres said,
``When someone is dead in front of you, you must give him a little
glory as a comfort to his family and those who loved him.''
   Marcos died Sept. 28 at age 72 after being hospitalized for
nearly nine months. His body was to be entombed Sunday at the
Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in what his family called ``a
temporary resting place.'' His widow, Imelda, has vowed to return
the body to the Philippines someday for burial.

<HEAD>Church Assured Terry Waite is Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England said Sunday it has been
assured by a reliable Iranian informant that missing church envoy
Terry Waite is alive on his 1,000th day in captivity.
   The unidentified source also provided assurances that two other
Britons missing in Lebanon, journalist John McCarthy and Northern
Irish teacher Brian Keenan, are alive, said Eve Keatley, a
spokeswoman for Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
   Waite, 50, the archbishop's personal emissary, vanished in
Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of
two U.S. hostages. He was on his fifth mission to Lebanon, and is
widely believed to have been taken captive by Iranian-backed Shiite
Moslem extremists.
   ``We have had further assurances this weekend from Iranian
sources that the three British hostages are alive,'' Ms. Keatley
said.
   ``We still have no concrete proof of this,'' she said. ``The
information comes via a channel that we think is reliable but which
we do not wish to identify.''
   A prayer by the archbishop was being said Sunday at churches
across Britain.
   ``Give Terry a sense of your abiding presence and the assurance
that fellow believers are one with him in spirit; encourage him and
all other hostages to face each new day in confidence and hope; and
grant that they may soon be restored to those whom they love,'' it
said.
   On Sunday, McCarthy had been missing for 1,278 days and Keenan
for 1,283 days.
   No group has claimed to hold them or Waite and there have been
no photographs or videotapes to prove they are alive. The British
government says no demands have been made for their freedom.
   Thirteen other Westerners, including eight Americans, are
missing. All Americans are believed held by Shiite factions.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve is ready to move large
amounts of cash into the American banking system on Monday if the
money is needed to prevent a financial crisis sparked by a sharp
drop in stock prices, it was reported Sunday.
   Flooding the banking system with money could reduce the risk
that Friday's 190-point fall in the Dow Jones average will turn
into a more serious financial disaster on Monday, the Washington
Post and the New York Times reported.
   ``Markets will be able to count on us to make sure the financial
system stays fluid,'' the Times quoted an unidentified official of
the Federal Reserve Board as saying.
   On Monday, ``it should be quite evident to the market that we
will satisfy liquidity needs. Our action in the market should make
it clear,'' an unnamed Fed official told the Post. Liquidity refers
to the ready availability of cash.
   The Fed's promise is aimed at preventing a repeat of the Wall
Street situation two years ago, when the market fell 508 points in
a single day.
   On the day before that fall, the stock index had fallen 108
points, leading mutual fund shareholders to cash in their shares.
As the mutual funds ran low, they had to sell more shares to raise
money, which in turn caused stock prices to drop even lower.
   ``To calm the markets it's important that institutions know
there are adequate funds available,'' the official told the Times.
``Once the markets realize there will be no credit crunch, we can
resume normal business.''
   According to the unnamed official quoted by the Times, the Fed's
decision was taken at a meeting late Friday and was being
communicated to officials in Asia and Western Europe this weekend.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Jerry picked up strength and shifted
a bit westward Sunday, and forecasters said the storm's center
should make landfall in Texas or Louisiana by early Monday and
could bring dangerous flooding and near-hurricane-force wind.
   Storm watches were posted from Morgan City, La., on the central
Louisiana coast, westward to Port O'Connor, Texas, on the central
Texas coast. Watches east of Morgan City were withdrawn. Earlier,
the storm watch had covered most of the Lousiana coast but only
small parts of Texas.
   Storm winds were clocked at 65 mph this morning, up from 60 mph
overnight.
   ``Some slight increase in strength is likely before landfall,
possibly bringing the winds to near hurricane force,'' Bb Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables,
said in an advisory.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach 74
mph.
   A storm warning was expected to be issued later Sunday for part
of the watch area, forecasters said.
   They warned of severe coastal flooding because of the
combination of coastal tides, which are expected to reach a peak
this weekend, and the storm's surge.
   ``Astronomical tides are expected to be the highest of the year
this weekend, and in combination with storm-surge water levels this
could produce dangerous coastal flooding, depending on the exact
path of the storm,'' Sheets said.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, the center was located near latitude 27.7 north,
longitude 94.0 west, or about 115 miles south-southeast of
Galveston, Texas. The storm was moving north-northwest at about 10
mph, bringing the center near the upper Texas Coast late Sunday or
early Monday, said Sheets.

<HEAD>Residents Allowed To Return Home After Ammonia Leak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most of the 6,500 residents forced to flee
when a frozen pizza plant leaked deadly ammonia gas were allowed
back into their homes early Sunday, but people with breathing
problems were told to wait.
   Authorities ordered a complete evacuation of the town Saturday
night when the gas, used for refrigeration, began leaking and
spread quickly over an area of about half a mile, said Fire
Department Lt. Ron Winters.
   Twenty-four people affected by the gas were taken to hospitals
and four were admitted, officials said. Many others were given
oxygen by paramedics who rushed to the scene from around the
largely rural southeastern quarter of Ohio.
   The anhydrous ammonia leak at the Pillsbury Co. Jeno's plant was
brought under control by 10:55 p.m., said Mayor John Carey.
   Assistant Fire Chief Bob Long said people started returning to
their homes just after 5 a.m. Sunday.
   ``The fog is still heavy. It's starting to lift up a little and
it smells kind of funny. You get a little odor of it,'' Long said.
   The mayor warned that the elderly, people with breathing
problems and small children could be affected by remaining vapor
and should remain away from the town until the ammonia dissipated
completely.
   Police had ordered people to evacuate a seven-block area near
the plant, then expanded the order to cover the entire town as the
gas spread, said Highway Patrol Dispatcher Jack Riley.
   Sheriff's deputies went door-to-door ordering people out of
their homes.
   Resident Vicki Dailey said she, her husband and two children
fled choking fumes about 9 p.m.
   ``We were out in the driveway and at first could not smell
anything,'' Mrs. Dailey said. ``But within about two minutes, we
started smelling it and decided to get out. We were choking.''
   Repair crews working breathing bottled oxygen reported the leak
came from a ruptured 16-inch pipe, but the cause of the break
wasn't known, said Vinton County Deputy Sheriff Marc Smith.
   Anhydrous ammonia fumes can be fatal if inhaled, according to an
emergency guidebook by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   Calls to the plant were not answered Sunday morning.

   Blacks remain disenfranchised
and the white minority remains in charge, but other aspects of
South African politics have changed markedly in the quarter-century
since Walter Sisulu and his colleagues went to jail.
   Black trade unions, banned at the time Sisulu, Nelson Mandela
and other African National Congress leaders received life prison
terms in 1964, now claim more than 2 million members and have the
power to cripple the biggest industries.
   A network of militant anti-apartheid groups has formed in black
townships across South Africa, linking churches, students, women
and workers in an organizational framework that was not available
to Sisulu and Mandela.
   Sisulu's hometown, the vast black township of Soweto, remains an
all-black ghetto providing a work force for Johannesburg, but it
now includes posh two-story homes as well as cramped matchbox
houses and shanties. More Sowetans commute to work in black-owned
taxis than in white-owned buses.
   In Johannesburg itself, several inner-city neighborhoods have
become thoroughly multiracial, even though laws mandating
residential segregation remain on the books.
   When Sisulu went to jail, virtually every type of public
facility in Johannesburg was segregated _ toilets, elevators,
parks, libraries, theaters, restaurants. Blacks and whites waited
in separate lines at post offices.
   Those segregation policies crumbled one by one, and the city's
final segregated amenities were opened up last month. Sisulu now
can ride buses, swim in swimming pools and patronize recreation
centers that formerly were reserved for whites.
   Segregated facilities remain in some other parts of the country,
but the government has hinted that the law allowing such
segregation may be headed for abolition.
   Public hospitals and schools remain segregated, but the number
of multiracial private schools has mushroomed since 1964. Many more
blacks have moved into professional and technical jobs, including
skilled mining jobs that until two years ago were exclusively for
whites.
   South Africa's international isolation has intensified steadily
since 1964. That was the first year the country was barred from the
Olympics, and it now is excluded from international competition in
almost every sport. A cultural boycott also is in effect, as are
numerous trade embargoes, and South Africa has been excluded from
the U.N. General Assembly since 1974.
   Anti-apartheid activism among South African whites was rare in
1964, outside a small ciricle of communist-oriented intellectuals
aligned to the ANC.
   There was one anti-apartheid legislator, Helen Suzman, in
Parliament. Now there are 34, with the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party having won 20 percent of the votes in the Sept. 6 general
election.
   Whites produce lively anti-apartheid newspapers, perform in
anti-apartheid rock bands and, in increasing numbers, journey
abroad to confer with the ANC's exiled leaders.
   Major changes also have taken place within the governing
National Party. In 1964, it unashamedly touted its ``grand
apartheid'' policy of relocating blacks into rural tribal
homelands, theorizing that the blacks could satisfy their desire
for political rights in the homelands while whites tightened
control over the other 87 percent of the country.
   The homelands still exist, but the National Party now
acknowledges that the blacks in ``white'' South Africa are
permanent residents who must be given a political role.
   Efforts to stem the flow of blacks into urban areas have eased,
and the government abolished the so-called pass laws that required
blacks in ``white'' areas to have permits.
   The new president, F.W. de Klerk, also is different from the
government leaders of the 1950s and early 60s. Since taking power,
he has pledged to eliminate discriminatory laws and negotiate a new
constitution within five years that would extend political rights
to blacks.
   However, de Klerk, like his predecessors, opposes a one-person,
one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule. He
envisions some mechanism through which whites would maintain a veto
power over major decisions, something Sisulu and his freed
colleagues are likely to find unacceptable.

<TEXT>
   Palestinian leaders met Sunday in the Iraqi
capital seeking a common strategy toward U.S. and Egyptian
proposals for direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was expected to come under pressure
from hard-liners to reject recent peace proposals by Israel, Egypt
and the United States, which have either ruled out PLO
participation in peace talks or left its role vague.
   The Central Council convened at the PLO's ``embassy'' in
downtown Baghdad under tight security.
   The council, comprising 80 members, acts as an intermediary
between the PLO's policy-making body, the Palestine National
Council, and the 15-man Executive Committee.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said it will discuss ``all
peace ideas that have been floating in recent months and will issue
a policy statement.'' He did not say how long the meeting would
last.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir proposed in May that
elections be held in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to allow
Palestinians to choose their own representatives under a plan for
limited self-rule.
   But he ruled out Israeli withdrawal from the territories, the
creation of a Palestinian state, or participation of Palestinians
outside the occupied territories in the elections.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a modified 10-point
election plan that urged Israel to accept the concept of trading
land for peace and enter into direct talks with the Palestinians.
Mubarak did not mention the PLO.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III invited the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Israel, Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Moshe Arens,
for talks in Washington but also ignored the PLO.
   Radical Palestinians, mainly George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh,
have been pushing for outright condemnation of the proposals.
   Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine faction, has warned Mubarak he could suffer the same fate
as his predecessor Anwar Sadat. Sadat was killed by Egyptian
radicals in October 1981, two years after he signed the Camp David
peace treaty with Israel.
   Hawatmeh, who leads the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, said: ``We are totally opposed to the Mubarak and Baker
plans which are only a new version of the ill-fated Camp David
accords.''
   ``Only the PLO can choose Palestinian representatives to any
dialogue,'' he told The Associated Press in Baghdad before the
meeting began.

   Last week's annual Conservative Party convention
revealed Thatcherism to be in trouble and striving for a kinder,
more caring image.
   Conservative conventions traditionally are designed less to
thrash out policies than to cheer the leader and unite the troops.
But this one seemed jinxed.
   With the pound sagging and inflation resurgent, interest rates
were pushed up to 15 percent, an eight-year high, just five days
before the convention opened in the seaside town of Blackpool.
   Then, as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was winding up the
convention with a rousing defense of her record, it was announced
that the annual inflation rate had crept up from 7.3 percent to 7.6
percent.
   Finally, as the delegates headed home Friday, Wall Street
slumped and left British business facing a jittery weekend.
   To compound Conservative worries, the opposition Labor Party has
been topping the opinion polls for the past four months, and its
lead averages seven points.
   That's normal against a government in midterm, say Conservative
loyalists. But after a decade in the wilderness, the socialists
under Neil Kinnock are beginning to look like credible challengers
again.
   At Labor's convention the previous week, vote-losing doctrines
like unilateral nuclear disarmament were formally dumped, and the
militant left, which had frightened off many voters in the past,
was thoroughly sidelined.
   Moreover, the centrist bloc in Mrs. Thatcher's party that has
helped keep her in power by garnering votes from Labor has
disintegrated, and Britain is back to straight two-party politics.
   None of this means an imminent end to Thatcherism, with its
hatred for socialism, distrust of trade unions and faith in market
forces.
   No election need be held until mid-1992, and Mrs. Thatcher, who
turned 64 last week, looked her usual vigorous, combative self.
   Even after 10 years in office _ an eternity by British standards
_ she remains securely in charge, revered by her supporters as the
warrior who slew the trade union dragon, liberated the marketplace
from socialist regulation and restored Britain's self-esteem.
   But even her best friends are telling her she's in trouble.
   When interest rates rose yet again, the conservative Daily Mail
demanded the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, who only a year earlier was being hailed by Conservatives
as a miracle worker.
   The pro-Thatcher Sunday Times reversed its past assessments and
concluded bluntly that ``There was no British economic miracle in
the 1980s after all.''
   Once again, it said, the country faced ``the perennial problems
of the British economy _ rising prices, balance of payments
deficits ... inflationary wage demands, slow growth and the huge
structural rigidities which hold Britain back.''
   At the convention, many delegates were asking why, after 10
years of Mrs. Thatcher's harsh medicine, inflation and high
interest rates are still around.
   ``Many people are feeling rather let down,'' delegate Peter
Brown said Thursday. ``They are rather upset that after 10 years of
Conservative rule we should have got into these rather difficult
times.''
   In the longer term, the convention was significant for the
signals it sent out that Thatcherism is preparing for change.
   Speakers seemed at pains to present a more compassionate brand
of Conservativism, even though that implies spending more
taxpayers' money on public services and would have been regarded
with suspicion by Thatcherite purists.
   There was an unexpected government pledge of $1.6 billion to
cushion Britons against an unpopular new property tax.
   Mrs. Thatcher assured delegates that the cherished National
Health Service was not going to be ``privatized'' on American
lines, as some had feared. An expected promise to sell off the
state-owned railroads never materialized.
   The volatile issue of Britain's place in a united Europe failed
to stir any fuss. Promises to protect the environment and enhance
the quality of life got big cheers.
   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, a leading contender
to succeed Mrs. Thatcher, railed against ``polluted rivers, filthy
streets, bodies bedded down in doorways (which) are no
advertisement for a prosperous and caring society.''
   The overall theme, said the liberal Guardian newspaper, was the
need to adjust to ``a coming decade where the old tunes have lost
their resonance.''
   The more conservative Times said that with Conservatives and
Labor both moving to the center, Britain might have ``a quite
different political landscape in the 1990s.''

<HEAD>Pope Condemns Modern Influences, Says They Endanger Families</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Sunday that
technological advancements such as television are threatening
traditional family life on this Indian Ocean island nation.
   ``Modern life has reached the shores of the island. Asphalt
roads and electricity arrive the same time as the means of social
communication'' such as television and videos, the pope told a
stadium full of Roman Catholics on the tiny island of Rodrigues,
390 miles east of the main island of Mauritius.
   ``In itself, this is praiseworthy progress, but, as in other
societies, Rodrigues suffers in full from influences such as those
of the video that threaten stability in the family,'' the pontiff
said.
   The 36,500 French-speaking inhabitants of Rodrigues are mainly
African-descended farmers and farm workers. About 97 percent are
Catholic.
   The pope expressed concern about the growing number of islanders
leaving to seek jobs in the booming economy on the main island,
where he arrived Saturday after eight days in Korea and Indonesia.
He returns to Rome on Monday.
   ``For a long time, Rodrigues seemed to be living tranquilly as
one big united family in which everyone knew everyone else and no
one was an outcast,'' said the pope. ``And suddenly, there is worry

   He urged the islanders to safeguard traditional values in a
country where tourism has doubled in the past six years to about
200,000 annually. Cardinal Jean Margeot has warned that the influx
of outsiders is creating serious ``moral'' problems for Mauritians.
   As the pope toured the island, topless European and South
African women sunned themselves on beaches in a land where most
native women wear long dresses and don't smoke or drink alcohol.
   In the past six years, 90,000 jobs have been created on
Mauritius, a democracy where people of several races and religions
coexist peacefully.
   The government of Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth has actively
courted foreign investment, creating a special export zone to
diversify the economy from its centuries of dependence on sugarcane.
   But Mauritians have become concerned about pollution as factory
smoke begins to cloud the sharp-edged mountains around the lagoons
and gas stations appear alongside the palm trees.
   The government last year created a department to monitor the
quality of life and financed it from liquor and cigarette taxes.
   Mauritius also has become a transit point for drug smugglers.
Signs at the international airport warn of a death penalty for

<HEAD>North Korea Condemns Arrest of Invaders of U.S. Ambassador's Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea on Sunday denounced the
arrests of six students who stormed the U.S. ambassador's residence
in rival South Korea last week.
   The official government newspaper Minju Choson declared: ``The
action of the Seoul students was an eruption of towering
indignation at the U.S. imperialist aggressors who have established
a colonial fascist rule over South Korea.''
   On Friday, six students stormed the official residence of U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg in Seoul. They hurled homemade bombs and
smashed artwork with iron bars, but Gregg and his wife, Meg,
escaped unharmed through a side entrance.
   Minju Choson's commentary, broadcast by the North's Korean
Central News Agency, said the arrest of the students ``is a
repressive outrage which could be done only by the pro-U.S.
flunky-ist traitors who cannot live a day without the patronage of
the U.S. imperialists.''
   It added: ``The Seoul students took over the U.S. ambassador's
residence and held an anti-U.S. sit-in, strongly demanding a
negotiation with the ambassador, a CIA agent, cancellation of the
traitor Roh Tae-woo's planned trip to the United states and stop to
the U.S. pressure on South Korea to import its agricultural and
aquatic products.
   ``This was an entirely just act,'' the newspaper said.
   Roh, the South Korean president, left Sunday for the United
States to confer with President Bush and address a joint session of
Congress.
   Gregg was a CIA station chief in Seoul in the 1970s.
   Radical students in South Korea oppose the presence of 43,000
U.S. military troops, stationed there under a mutual defense pact,
saying they hamper reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 into the Communist
North and capitalist South.

   A hot air balloon carrying sightseers
struck some power lines north of Sydney on Sunday and crashed,
killing the pilot and a passenger, police said.
   The pilot was a electrocuted and a female passenger died of
internal injuries, said a police spokesman who did not identify
himself. He said three other passengers escaped uninjured.
   The balloon was flying over the Hunter Valley vineyards, about
80 miles north of Sydney, when it crashed.
   The accident was the fourth involving hot air balloons in
Australia in the past two months. Thirteen people died Aug. 13 when
their balloon collided with another and and two people died
Wednesday when a balloon hit power lines near Mudgee, 112 miles
northwest of Sydney.
   Six passengers were hurt a week ago when a balloon crashed into
a hillside north of Melbourne.

   If visitors to this museum get the feeling
they're being watched by hundreds of eyes, they're right. After
all, they're standing in the Potato Museum.
   Surely one of the smallest museums in Washington, if not
anywhere in the world, the Potato Museum occupies the basement of a
yellow-brick rowhouse on Capitol Hill that is the home of Tom and
Meredith Hughes, a fun-loving couple of spud fanatics, and their
5-year-old son, Gulliver.
   Gulliver's nickname, naturally, is ``Tater Tot.''
   Filling the two tiny basement rooms are 400 items from the
Hugheses' collection of 2,000 potato artifacts, from a bronzed,
heart-shaped potato donated by a Canadian woman to a North Carolina
inventor's digital ``Tater Time Clock'' which runs _ believe it or
not _ on electrical current supplied by the acids in two attached
potatoes.
   ``The goodness of the potato knows no bounds,'' the couple
gushed in a tuber tome they wrote in 1986, titled ``The Great
Potato Book,'' extolling the virtues of their favorite vegetable.
   Visitors to the private, non-profit museum are welcomed by Mrs.
Hughes with a slide show of potato folklore, accompanied by tapes
of such top tuber tunes as ``Cold Tater Stomp'' or Weird Al
Yanokovich's ``Addicted to Spuds.''
   Then her husband, a schoolteacher in suburban McLean, Va.,
invites guests to become couch potatoes and enjoy his videotape of
``great moments in potatoes'' from Hollywood movies. The scenes
include Marilyn Monroe snacking on potato chips in ``The Seven-Year
Itch'' and Richard Dreyfuss making a mountain of his mashed
potatoes at the dinner table in ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind.''
   Q: What was the biggest potato ever grown?
   A. An Englishman named Thomas Seddal is reputed to have
harvested a monster spud weighing 18 pounds, 4 ounces on Feb. 17,
1795.
   Q. What was the biggest single serving of mashed potatoes in
history?
   A. An 18,260-pound mound of instant mashed potatoes, prepared in
a cement mixer truck for the annual Potato Bowl football game at
Grand Forks, N.D., in 1982.
   The museum's shelves are stuffed with potato toys (including a
``Spudomatic'' air pistol that shoots potato pellets), a burlap
potato sack jacket, potato posters, dolls and postage stamps, a
1948 Idaho ``World Famous Potatoes'' license plate and some
4,000-year-old potatoes preserved in a jar.
   There's also a cluster of antique potato chip cans, a basket of
deep-fried potato skins woven by the chef at Antoine's Restaurant
in New Orleans, and a staggering assortment of implements and
kitchen appliances _ potato mashers, slicers, peelers, scrubbers,
hoes, rakes, planters, baskets, diggers and beetle sprayers.
   One rack displays sample products made from potatoes _ Polish
vodka, hand lotion, ice cream, bread, a sheet of paper, a necklace
and ``autochromes,'' an early color photographic process using
potato starch _ which also is used to make candy and glue.
   Hughes says potatoes fueled German rockets in World War II, and
once were used as money by the island people of Tristan da Cunha.
They're good for treating acne, sunburn and toothaches, he claims,
and they make great chicken feed.
   The Potato Museum began in 1975, when Hughes asked his
fifth-grade pupils at the International School of Brussels to
prepare an exhibit showing why potatoes are so important in
Belgium. The Belgians grow potatoes in backyard gardens the way
Americans grow tomatoes, he says, and their ``frites'' _ which
Americans mistakenly call French fries _ are the most delicious in
the world.
   Artifacts from that classroom project formed the nucleus of the
museum, which moved to Washington with the Hugheses in 1983. The
independent, tax-exempt museum gets most of its financial support
from membership dues, souvenir sales and a grant from a potato
research center in Lima, Peru.
   For $20 a year, members receive six issues of the museum's
newsletter, ``Peelings,'' and invitations to occasional potluck
dinners where the all-potato menu ranges from pickled potato hors
d'oeuvres to a dessert made of chocolate-laced mashed potatoes.
   Hughes says he and Meredith have two ambitions: to visit the
Chilean island where Spanish explorers found potatoes and
introduced them to Europe in 1570, and to take a cruise on a newly
built Japanese potato tanker.
   The Hugheses love potatoes because they're not only good eating,
but they're fun and friendly.
   ``They are a comfort food when we feel lonely, sick or sad, but
we also see something of ourselves in them,'' said Mrs. Hughes,
cuddling a spud in her hand. ``Look, it has eyes, a head, a face.
It's somehow almost human.''

<TEXT>
   While World War II still raged, an American
serviceman had a burst of inspiration and painted a giant picture
of the famed B-17 bomber on a brick wall at a U.S. airfield.
   The B-17 is ancient aviation history now, and the airfield is
used as a drag-racing strip. The name of the fatigue-clad artist is
barely remembered.
   But the mural that stood in obscurity since 1944 has been taken
down as part of a plan to restore it and move it to a permanent
place of honor.
   ``It was a thrill to see something that has been in the dark for
more than 40 years come into the light again and be saved for
posterity,'' said Richard Nimmo, one of a group of English
enthusiasts who seek to perserve such relics.
   The picture _ which shows the famous ``Flying Fortress''
unloading its bombs while anti-aircraft shells burst around it _
was taken down Saturday from its place at Podington airfield, an
old base of the World War II-era U.S. 8th Air Force.
   Podington airfield, 65 miles north of London, was one of about
130 8th Air Force bases for bombers and fighters in the eastern
England flatlands. They were established to raid Germany and
German-occupied territory.
   After the war, most of the Podington field reverted to farming.
The brick huts used by the crews have remained as workshops for
drag-racing on the airfield runway, and the control tower has been
converted into a house.
   The mural was on a piece of wall on farmland. The removal team
had to get permission from the farmer to take down the painting,
and they will have to rebuild the wall. A benefactor has given them
750 red bricks for the task.
   With help from the U.S. air base at Alconbury near Cambridge,
the mural is to soon be transported to Duxford, another old 8th Air
Force field about 35 miles east of Podington.
   Britain's Imperial War Museum maintains Duxford for its
collection of historic aircraft and will set up the B-17 mural as
part of its display about the 8th Air Force.
   The 12-by-8 foot painting was done in about 1944 by a staff
sergeant named Walderschmidt, Nimmo said.
   ``We think he was on the ground crew,'' he said. ``We don't know
anything else about him except that we heard he is still alive in
the United States. We don't know his first name or where he lives.''

   Forty of the country's top singers
have pooled their talents to record a song that pleads for peace on
this ethnically torn Indian Ocean island.
   The new song was titled ``Give Peace A Chance'' and sung in the
Tamil, Sinhalese and English languages. It was played this weekend
on state-run radio and television.
   ``Our song, the first sung jointly by 40 top vocalists, is to
achieve peace in our country, where everybody cries for just
that,'' said composer Sunil Perera.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people. Militant Tamils have been fighting
since 1983 for an independent homeland in the northeast. They
allege they are denied jobs and education by the predominantly
Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.
   More than 11,000 people have died in the Tamil rebellion.
Another 5,000 have been killed in the backlash by Sinhalese
extremists that started two years ago.

   ROUTE 69, Cambodia (AP) _ Following their capture of three
towns, Cambodian guerrillas have begun a coordinated attack on the
only big town blocking their advance to the strategic city of
Sisophon, which is controlled by the Vietnam-installed government.
   The guerrillas claim they already have taken frontline positions
at Svey Chek. The offensive began Saturday, and all day the area
reverberated with hundreds of artillery blasts.
   More than 1,000 guerrillas were seen Saturday trekking on the
roads to Svey Chek from the recently captured towns of Thmar Puok,
Banteay Chmar and Kandoul. Following them were convoys of people
carrying ammunition and more than 50 ox carts full of ammunition,
mortars, rockets and anti-tank weapons.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front claimed it seized
Thmar Puok and Banteay Chmar, along Highway 69 leading to Sisophon,
and Kandoul, just west of the highway, days after launching a
``general offensive'' on Sept. 30.
   A 16-hour, 94-mile tour Saturday of the towns and several
captured artillery bases showed they were firmly under the
Liberation Front's control.
   Field commanders said the Liberation Front was attacking Svey
Chek in uncommon coordination with its two partners in the
resistance coalition, the Khmer Rouge and the forces of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
   The guerrillas are trying to topple the government Vietnam
installed after it invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Their attacks
intensified after Vietnam made what it called the pullout of its
last troops from Cambodia on Sept. 26.
   Capturing Sisophon, a major military base for operations in
northwestern Cambodia, would be a major victory for the guerrillas,
who have not seized any areas of such significance.
   The tour began at a Liberation Front base along the Thai border
south of the Dong Ruk mountains, where the guerrillas showed off
captured equipment _ more than 1,000 automatic rifles, heavy
machine guns, mortars, many cases of anti-personnel mines and
teletype machines with Soviet lettering.
   The journey into Cambodia was on motorcyles, with about 20
Liberation Front guerrillas. It was slow and grueling, covering
roads drenched by monsoon rains.
   Everywhere were captured artillery positions, virtually all
capable of hitting Site 2, the Liberation Front's major civilian
base just inside Thailand. Three destroyed tanks, four destroyed
heavy trucks and heavy artillery guns were abandoned on the roads.
   Everywhere were former government soldiers who had defected to
the guerrilla side.
   The three captured towns appeared only lightly defended and
there were no signs the guerrillas expected a counteroffensive.
   Civilians farmed in the fields, seeming to go about their lives
normally.
   The twisted remants of two tanks sat at the edge of Banteay
Chmar, blasted by anti-tank weapons the guerrillas recently
acquired. Some guerrillas have said the weapons may change the
course of the war the way the acquisition of Stinger missiles did
for the guerrillas in Afghanistan.
   Children played around the destroyed tanks.
   Hundreds of residents greeted the guerrillas arriving in the
town with a religious ceremony, and Liberation Front division
commander Gen. Koh Chien made a speech and gave money to a village
headman and to Buddhist monks.
   The town had been guarded by 300 or 400 government soldiers,
said village head Ta Rah, 64.
   ``The (Liberation Front) attacked and they all left right
away,'' he said, laughing.
   The guerrillas radioed for a car after one motorcyle in the
convoy broke down. The driver of the Soviet-made military transport
truck that arrived was a former government soldier who brought the
vehicle when he defected.
   Asked if he missed home, he said: ``No. We want to stay with the
KPNLF.''
   The truck's left front wheel struck a land mine just after
passing a guerrilla base at San Lo. The mine apparently had been
planted by government troops as they abandoned the base in a recent
guerrilla attack.
   Both of the driver's legs were blown off, and he later died.
Several passengers, including this reporter, were wounded. The
vehicle burned.

   Just a few years ago, opera audiences and
critics were bemoaning the lack of any new Verdi sopranos to fill
the void left by the retirement of Leontyne Price.
   Then came a young American upstart named Aprile Millo.
   On Saturday came another _ Alessandra Marc.
   Even in a Metropolitan Opera season notable for exciting debuts,
Marc's first performance as ``Aida'' was something special, as the
standing-room-only crowd acknowledged with its repeated ovations.
   Here is the genuine article _ a dramatic soprano with an opulent
voice that can be thrilling in its power or tender in its warmth as
the occasion demands.
   She has the gleaming tones to ride above the full forces of
orchestra and chorus that Verdi assembled for the Triumphal Scene
of Act 2. She has the artistry to create a portrayal of the
tormented Ethiopian princess in the aria ``O patria mia,'' which
opens the Nile Scene in Act 3.
   She also has a few problems.
   Vocally, the lower register of her voice is undeveloped and
colorless. At the other end of her range, she has trouble reining
in the volume and seems unable to float the high pianissimos that
are one of Millo's trademarks.
   Dramatically, Marc is hampered by being enormously overweight, a
condition that makes believable involvement with the other
characters difficult. In one of the opera's most moving scenes, her
father, Amonasro, is supposed to throw Aida to the ground in angry
rejection. The most that baritone Juan Pons could do was push her
gently and allow her to slump on a nearby rock.
   Marc, who is in her early 30s, grew up in the Washington, D.C.,
area, as Judith Borden. She changed her name a few years ago,
saying she was tired of being confused with the soprano Judith
Blegen and wanted a name with a good international ring to it.
   She has the name. Now it's up to her whether she will have the
career to match.
   The rest of Saturday's ``Aida'' was workmanlike but
undistinguished. As the wooden hero, Radames, tenor Nicola
Martinucci strained at his high notes; mezzo Stefania Toczyska was
earnest, if not thrilling, as the villainous Amneris, and Pons
brought warmth and intensity to the brief role of Amonasro.
Christian Badea's conducting was lively and sensitive.
   Marc is the second American singer to make a triumphant debut
this season at the Met, a company often criticized for being too
slow to engage promising native talent. Two weeks ago, tenor
Richard Leech sang Rodolfo in Puccini's ``La Boheme'' to great
acclaim. Millo, who has been singing major roles at the Met for
several years, got to open the current season as ``Aida.''
   There's more to come. The coloratura June Anderson will debut in
Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' later this fall; Susan Dunn, another
contender in the Verdi sweepstakes, sings in ``Il Trovatore'' in
February, and soprano Ashley Putnam will sing in Gounod's ``Faust''
in March.

   WALTER SISULU:
   Sisulu ran day-to-day operations of the ANC as secretary-general
from 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. He was one
of the ANC's most important leaders in the years when it grew from
a small organization into a mass movement. He helped organize a
national campaign to defy apartheid laws in 1952.
   Born May 18, 1912, in the Xhosa homeland of Transkei, he joined
the congress in 1940 and formed the Youth League in 1943 to press
for more aggressive tactics. After his acquittal along with 155
other defendants in a 1956-61 treason trial, Sisulu was restricted
to his house, arrested six times, and finally convicted of
furthering the aims of the now-outlawed guerrilla group. While on
bail pending appeal he went underground and was captured three
months later in Rivonia.

   AHMED KATHRADA:
   Kathrada, arrested at age 17 for participation in a passive
resistance campaign in 1946, was a member of the high command of
the African National Congress' military wing. He is one of only two
Rivonia defendants who denied all the charges against him. He was
convicted on only one count, sabotage.
   Kathrada was born Aug. 21, 1929, in the western Transvaal to a
scholarly Moslem family and became involved in politics at age 11.
He joined the Communist Party in the early 1940s and as general
secretary of the Transvaal Indian Congress was instrumental in
linking it to the African National Congress. He was acquitted in
the 1956-61 mass treason trial but placed under house arrest in
1962. He went underground a few months before his arrest at Rivonia.

   ELIAS MOTSOALEDI:
   As a founder of the Johannesburg regional command of the ANC's
military wing, Motsoaledi hid recruits and helped send them abroad
for military training and procuring arms, prosecutors alleged at
the Rivonia trial. He said he joined the military wing in 1962.
   Born in northern Transvaal Province on July 26, 1924, the son of
a migrant laborer, Motsoaledi worked in Johannesburg as a servant
and at factories. He joined the Communist Party in 1949 and the
congress in 1948.
   In 1949, he became chairman of the Council of Non-European Trade
Unions, organized strikes and was banned in 1952. He was held in
solitary confinement for three months in 1960 before going
underground. His wife, Caroline, lives in Soweto. Three of their
seven children are in exile.

   At the Rivonia trial, Mhlaba denied he belonged to the high
command of the African National Congress' military wing. But he was
identified in the South African press as the man who became
commander-in-chief after the arrest in 1962 of Mandela.
   In 1952, Mhlaba was the first congress leader arrested as part
of the defiance campaign, when he led blacks through the ``whites
only'' entrance to a train station.
   He was born Dec. 2, 1920, son of a policeman. He dropped out of
school, became active in trade unions in Port Elizabeth, joined the
Communist Party in 1943 and the congress in 1944.
   In 1986, prison authorities allowed him to marry the mother of
three of his eight children.

   Mlangeni said at the Rivonia trial he had agreed to carry
messages for the congress' military wing, but he denied he was a

explosives and being a member of the Johannesburg command.
   Born in Johannesburg on May 30, 1926, he worked as a golf caddy
to pay for school and later as a clerk, bus driver and journalist.
He joined the congress in 1951 and was regional secretary for the
township of Soweto from 1958-60, before he went underground.

   WILTON MKWAYI:
   Mkwayi, 66, briefly took command of the congress' military wing

being convicted on 58 counts of sabotage. The judge said Mkwayi
received guerrilla training in China and had taught African
National Congress members how to make bombs. In 1987, Mkwayi was
allowed to marry his common-law wife, Irene. She died in December.

   OSCAR MPETHA:
   The country's oldest political prisoner, 80-year-old Mpetha
began campaigning for black rights as a union organizer in the
1940s. A diabetic, he had a leg amputated in 1983 and been
hospitalized for most of the past three years.
   Born Aug. 5, 1909, he joined the African National Congress in
1951 and became its Cape Town regional chairman in 1958. He helped
found the Communist-oriented South African Congress of Trade Unions.
   In 1980, he was charged with murder and terrorism in connection
with the slaying of two whites at a roadblock erected by black
youths near Cape Town. He was convicted of terrorism in 1983 and
began a five-year sentence in 1985 after losing an appeal.
   In August 1983, Mpetha was elected co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   Mpetha's wife and a son died while he was jailed. He was denied
permission to attend the funerals.

<UNK>Surgeons Give 39-Day-Old Girl New Heart</UNK>
<DATELINE>PADOVA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors said Sunday that a 39-day-old
Italian girl who underwent a heart transplant operation was in
stable condition and resting peacefully.
   Giorgia Panizzolo, who was born Sept. 5 with a tumor in her
heart, became the youngest person to undergo the surgery in Italy
when doctors at Padova Hospital completed the four-hour operation
early Saturday.
   Dr. Vincenzo Gallucci, who headed the surgical team, said the
girl would have survived without the operation and was near death
when the surgery began late Friday.
   The surgeon also said the girl could have a better chance for a
healthy life than someone who had the surgery as an adult.
   ``At this age there is no risk of rejection because the body has
not yet developed antibodies,'' he explained.
   The hospital said the donor was a 3-month-old West German girl
who died Friday in Freiburg of a cerebral anuerism.
   The Italian girl is the daughter of Antonio Pannizzolo, a
28-year-old farmer, and his wife Sonia, 23.

   A top secret government program known as the
Doomsday Project is leaving a bitter legacy, with a veteran
counterintelligence expert alleging he is being harassed for
reporting improprieties and poor management.
   The program, referred to at the Pentagon simply as Project 908,
is designed to ensure that even if top U.S. civilian leaders are
killed in a surprise nuclear attack, the United States can still
unleash its own atomic weapons on the Soviet Union.
   So far, the government has spent $4 billion to $5 billion to
build supply depots, underground bunkers and a communications
network that has been plagued with problems, say Pentagon sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Army inspector general's office reviewed the program in 1987
and interviewed Army civilian employee W. Thomas Golden.
   Golden, chief of the operations security branch at the
Information Systems Command in Fort Huachuca, Ariz., asserted to
the IG that:
   _The communications network vital to the project didn't work
properly, was costing hundreds of millions of dollars to fix and
Project 908 officials on several occasions misled members of
Congress into believing that the system was operational when in
fact it wasn't.
   _The son of Army Brig. Gen. Eugene Renzi was doing work for
Betac Corp., an Arlington, Va., firm to which Renzi had directed a
sole-source, no-bid contract in connection with Project 908.
   _The Betac contract specified that one of Renzi's aides would be
a $400-a-day consultant to the company.
   Army regulations say the inspector general will protect the
anonymity of witnesses, but within weeks of Golden's confidential
discussions, word had leaked to Renzi that Golden was making
allegations against the general.
   Golden alleged that Col. Ned Bacheldor, chief of the inspector
general's intelligence oversight division, had informed Renzi that
Golden was the source of the allegation about Renzi's son. Renzi
told Army investigators in sworn testimony he had found out about
Golden's allegations from an aide, not from Bacheldor.
   The Army inspector general's office concluded that Renzi had
retaliated against Golden by spreading word that Golden would not
be welcome at Fort Ritchie, Md., where Renzi directed the 7th
Signal Command.
   ``Because of ... Renzi's action,'' Golden's effectiveness ``was
diminished'' and ``he could not do his job,'' according to an Army
memo obtained by The Associated Press.
   Golden requested reassignment and now handles
counterintelligence matters in connection with the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Renzi was reprimanded for retaliating against Golden, but has
since been promoted to the rank of major general and is stationed
in Hawaii.
   Renzi, Bacheldor and Golden all rejected interview requests made
through military spokesmen.
   But the AP has learned that Renzi told a House Armed Services
Committee investigator late last year that Bacheldor had leaked
Golden's name to Renzi's boss, Lt. Gen. Emmett Paige, who passed it
along to Renzi.
   Golden told Congress recently he still is being targeted for
retribution. Two officials in Project 908 ``have engaged in a smear
campaign against me,'' Golden said in a letter to the House Armed
Services Committee obtained by The AP from sources on Capitol Hill.
   Security chief John Hartford and legal counsel Ernie Peluso
tried to obtain Golden's telephone records in an effort to link him
to a reporter for U.S. News &amp; World Report who wrote an article
about Project 908, Golden alleged.
   Hartford and Peluso work at the Defense Mobilization Systems
Planning Activity, a key Project 908 component where Bacheldor is
now chief of staff.
   According to several sources, Army Secretary John Marsh
intervened and stopped the effort to get Golden's telephone records.
   Hartford and Peluso declined requests for interviews to comment
on the reports.
   Renzi's son and the $400-a-day consultant who was Renzi's aide
left the Betac payroll early in 1988, according to Pentagon sources.
   The work Betac does for the government is ``aboveboard, there's
been no wrongdoing by Betac'' and ``this is all water over the
dam,'' said Joseph Royal, the company's director of personnel.

   A Soviet dancer disappeared last week from
a hotel in Madrid, where he was performing with a Soviet dance
troupe, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The newspaper El Pais said Vladimir Karimov, 39, had been
missing since Friday. He was here with the Soviet Union's Red Army
Choir and Dance Troupe.
   The newspaper reported that the dance group noted his
disappearance about 8:00 a.m. Friday. After awaiting several hours
for him they decided to continue their trip to Portugal, where they
were scheduled to perform.
   Police said the disappearance of the Soviet dancer would be the
first step in asking for political asylum but that they had not
heard from him.

   The Soviet Union is on schedule in withdrawing
forces from Eastern Europe but has made little progress on military
reductions within its borders, says a congressional report released
Sunday.
   The House Armed Services Committee study found that since late
April the Soviets have been pulling back their forces as part of
reductions proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 7,
1988.
   However, the withdrawal of six tank divisions, 50,000 men and
5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe has not been carried out as Western
observers expected.
   ``Rather than withdrawing a tank division in its entirety, the
motorized rifle regiment assigned to it is being transferred to a
division that would remain in Eastern Europe and a tank regiment
from that division withdrawn instead,'' the report said.
   A motorized rifle regiment is similar to a U.S. mechanized
infantry.
   Thirteen members of the committee traveled to the Soviet Union
in early August, a 13-day trip that included visits to an East
German military unit, a motorized rifle division in Yavorov and an
intermediate-range nuclear forces elimination facility in Sarny.
   The report was based on observations by the legislators and
defense experts who traveled with the delegation.
   The committee's assessment is consistent with comments made by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last month in releasing the Pentagon
study, ``Soviet Military Power.''
   Cheney said that while the Soviets are unilaterally withdrawing
some ground forces, they are reorganizing and modernizing their
general purpose forces, upgrading their communications networks and
researching future generations of weapons systems.
   The congressional report said there is ``great uncertainty about
what the Soviets will do with the equipment being removed from
their forces.'' Specifically, the study found that tanks withdrawn
from Eastern Europe and slated to be destroyed or converted, will
likely replace older equipment in units within the Soviet Union.
   The study concluded that ``Soviet forces are clearly being
pulled back from Eastern Europe into the Soviet Union, but little
is known so far about what is happening to Soviet forces inside the
Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev had vowed to reduce Soviet forces west of the Ural
mountains by 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 800 combat
aircraft. The timetable for the reductions and withdrawals is two
years.
   Based on observations of its members, the committee concluded
that ``while NATO must be careful to avoid taking any actions that
are more difficult to reverse than those happening on the other
side, it is not too soon to take advantage of the changes already
taking place on the ground, namely the withdrawal of Soviet forces
from Eastern Europe.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee who headed the delegation, said, ``Now that we have a
good understanding of what's going on there, we can figure out how
to respond.''

<HEAD>NBC's Ratings Streak Set to End After 68 Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's remarkable command of the weekly TV
ratings will almost certainly end this week, as a resurgent ABC _
helped by its World Series broadcasts _ makes a bid for the Nielsen
pennant.
   For the first time in 68 weeks, even NBC is convinced it won't
be No. 1 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings issued Tuesday, ending a
winning streak unmatched in television history.
   ``I'm sorry it's come to an end, but I hope we start a new
streak soon,'' said Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment's
president. ``I'd like to start a new one as soon as the last out is
made at the World Series.''
   Odds are long, though, that NBC _ or any other network _ soon
will assemble such a string of triumphs. The previous record of 46
weeks on top was set by CBS in the 1962-63 season.
   Not only is the network sweepstakes increasingly competitive,
but upcoming blockbuster sporting events like the Super Bowl, on
ABC, and next year's baseball playoffs, on CBS, are divided more
evenly.
   ``I don't think we're going to match real soon, and I don't know
if anybody will match it,'' Tartikoff said.
   NBC's reign over the ratings _ used to determine advertising
rates, and thus the key to a network's fortunes _ stands apart for
several reasons.
   First, NBC succeeded mostly without appealing to the lowest
common denominator, winning 25 Emmys last month, second only to
CBS' 27.
   Second, the streak survived such highly touted miniseries as
ABC's ``War and Remembrance'' and CBS' ``Lonesome Dove.''
   Third, even last summer's screenwriters' strike, which threw the
1988-89 season into chaos, didn't derail NBC.
   ``Raw numbers don't tell the whole story,'' Tartikoff said,
because the streak came ``in the most competitive environment
that's ever existed.''
   CBS' record ride as No. 1 ``took place in a day and age when
there was no World Series in prime time, there was no Super Bowl in
prime time and there was no such thing as movies for television or
miniseries,'' he said.
   Bob Wright, a spokesman for ABC, said ABC believes its expected
ratings victory won't last long after the World Series.
   Such modesty aside, ABC has started the new season strongly. In
last week's ratings, it had seven of network television's top 10
programs and finished within eight-tenths of a ratings point of NBC
for the week.
   ABC's working-class situation comedy ``Roseanne'' was the
highest-rated program of the week, with a rating of 27.8, its
highest ever. The other ABC shows in the top 10 were ``The Wonder
Years,'' ``Who's the Boss?,'' ``NFL Monday Night Football,''
``Chicken Soup,'' ``Growing Pains'' and ``Head of the Class.''
   The rating is the percentage of the 90.4 million homes with TV
sets in the United States, with each point equivalent to 904,000
households.
   While ABC is burdened by the low-rated ``Mr. Belvedere,''
``Homeroom'' and ``Living Dolls,'' among others, its schedule is
fairly solid on every week night except Thursday. Since 1984, NBC
has dominated Thursday with ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``Cosby,'' more than any other series, was responsible for NBC's
rise from the ratings trash heap. So low had NBC fallen earlier
this decade that in the 1981-82 season it didn't have one show in
the top 20.
   NBC's streak also was the result of sophisticated marketing,
promotion and scheduling. Last November, against the upscale ``War
and Remembrance,'' NBC delivered mass-market hits like ``Back to
the Future,'' ``The Karate Kid Part II'' and the Vanna White
quasi-movie ``Goddess of Love.''
   Although NBC didn't want the streak to end, there is some
consolation for the network in not having to maintain the
succession any longer.
   ``With the streak over ... we can nurture a fragile show _
tomorrow's `St. Elsewhere' or tomorrow's `Cheers.' Now, we won't
get itchy trigger fingers'' and pre-empt shows to guarantee another
ratings win, Tartikoff said.

   The Education Department is expanding the
scope of its regional strategy sessions to include initiatives
beyond ``choice,'' after months of wrangling with the chairman of
the House Education Committee about the meetings' limited agenda.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos opens the first session Monday
night, when he meets with East Harlem, N.Y., parents. A daylong
session, complete with a plenary and concurrent workshops, will
follow on Tuesday.
   ``Our purpose in calling for these meetings is to ratchet up the
debate about the importance of choice in the move to restructure
schools,'' said Education Undersecretary John Sanders.
   Choice is the concept that allows parents to decide where their
children will attend school. It is based on the theory that
competition will shake up and improve bad schools.
   However, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, had argued that the Education Department's
strategy sessions should address other proposals for education
reform.
   Hawkins said he and several committee members object to
``choice'' because ``we believe it's a new way of resegregating the
schools.'' He added that some disadvantaged children also may be
forced to give up needed services in order to attend a school
outside the district.
   He said the department has relented and that the meetings will
include other ideas and that opponents of ``choice'' will be
allowed to talk.
   Hawkins, D-Calif., bristles at the cross-country ``choice''
blitz that will take the education secretary to Minnesota, North
Carolina, Colorado and California over the next two months.
   ``Why have they selected one program in education, which is not
authorized (by Congress) and not included in the package that we
passed last year?'' said Hawkins, pointing to an outline of the
``School Improvement'' Act.
   The new law reauthorizes virtually all major federal elementary
and secondary education programs through fiscal year 1993,
including Chapter One for the disadvantaged, science and math
programs, magnet programs for specialized instruction, bilingual
education and child development.
   Hawkins said the new law ``provided for some accountability at
school districts to document improvements over each year,'' as well
as local control.
   ``Full funding and implementation of the School Improvement Act
of 1988 assures precisely that kind of choice, and I urge you to
make it your most immediate and top priority,'' said Hawkins in a
letter to Cavazos.
   ``Real choice comes about when all parents get involved on a
daily basis with the education of their children, whether they
attend magnet schools or not,'' said the letter. ``Administrators,
teachers, parents and their children working together for school
improvements in each school building, as required in the Chapter
One (for disadvantaged children), for instance, will help to bring
about improvements for all children, not just those who attend
certain select schools.''
   Sanders acknowledged that the new law ``addresses accountability
and local control, yes,'' but stressed that ``it deals specifically
with federal programs. It gives new accountability measures within
those programs. We're talking about (something) much broader. We're
talking about the system itself.''
   Since he could not stop the meetings, Hawkins said he worked for
months before he got the Education Department to agree to allow
other education reform programs to be discussed and opponents of
``choice'' to participate.
   Hawkins also received an invitation to attend but it was
uncertain whether he would.
   Reps. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, are
expected to attend, along with participants from Maine, Vermont,
New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia,
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Cavazos and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean will address the meeting.
   The most controversial form of school choice is allowing parents
to send their child to a school outside their school district. But
other initiatives include magnet schools that specialize in certain
subjects, alternative programs and teacher-initiated schools.
   So far this year, Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska have joined
Minnesota, whose open enrollment plan went into effect this past
school year. Many other states offer more limited choice options
aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic problems that
only certain districts can handle.
   Chapter One is given to schools that have a large concentration
of disadvantage students and are located in low-income areas.
   Expected high transportation costs also will limited the options
of low-income parents, Hawkins said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard: Shrimp Boats Won't Be Targeted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shrimpers could be fined $8,000 or more starting
Monday if caught with nets that lack turtle excluder devices, gates
that allow endangered sea turtles to escape from the nets without
drowning.
   Shrimpers, who had hoped that President Bush would grant a
last-minute reprieve, complain that the devices, known as TEDs,
cause them to lose nearly a third of their catch. Government
studies have shown losses of 5 percent to 10 percent.
   Although shrimpers have been required to use TEDs since Sept. 8,
until Sunday the federal government had forgiven the penalties _ at
first in whole and later in part _ if a shrimper bought and
installed a TED after being caught without one.
   But beginning Monday, a shrimper can be fined $8,000 for a first
offense and $15,000 for a second. A third offense could cost
$15,000 and confiscation of the shrimper's vessel, catch, or both.
   The change in enforcement won't change how the U.S. Coast Guard
monitors shrimp boats, said Lt. Scott LaRochelle in Galveston.
   ``What we've been doing in normal law enforcement operations is
stopping boats randomly while in the water,'' LaRochelle said. ``If
we happen to stop shrimp boats we'll check for TEDs.''
   The Coast Guard reports violations it finds to the National
Marine Fisheries Service, which imposes the penalties.
   ``Our policy remains unchanged. We still continue to look for
TEDS in routine boardings. As far as the Coast Guard is concerned,
there was never a stoppage of that,'' said Coast Guard Petty
Officer 2nd Class Robert Morehead, in New Orleans.
   Pat Philben, a Coast Guard spokesman in New Orleans, said
compliance with the TEDs regulation is improving. He and Gene
Proulx, a National Marine Fisheries Service enforcement official,
agreed that compliance is very good off Florida and good along
Texas, but said it is poor off Louisiana.
   LaRochelle said Coast Guard officials in the Galveston area have
reported about 50 percent compliance of TEDs on shrimp boats they
searched.
   Milton Zirlott, a fisherman in Mobile County, Ala., said most
Alabama shrimpers have tried TEDs, but few continued to use them.
   Some shrimpers have very strong opinions about TEDs.
   L. Jack Smith of Mobile, Ala., a partner in Southeastern
Fisheries Inc., said if TED regulations stand, ``We're just going
to sell our equipment and turn our boats back to the banks, because
there's no sense in losing money anymore.''

   Sobbing refugees and their children
scuffled with U.N. troops Sunday who blocked them from returning to
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus from the Greek sector of the
divided island.
   Police estimated the number of demonstrators at 3,000 and
stopped most of them from bursting into the U.N.-patrolled buffer
zone splitting Cyprus into Greek and Turkish sectors.
   But about 200 demonstrators, mainly women and children, managed
to push through lines of police and British and Danish U.N.
peacekeeping troops.
   After repeated scuffles, they broke through the three successive
lines to penetrate about 500 yards into the buffer zone. They were
stopped before reaching the fortified Turkish lines, about 500
yards away.
   ``We ask you not to proceed further as we cannot guarantee your
safety,'' a U.N. officer repeatedly said through a bullhorn.
   Some troops roughly pushed back the refugees. Others chased
children and young teen-age boys and girls, bringing some of them
down with flying tackles.
   Armed Turkish troops and Turkish Cypriot riot police stood on
the outskirts of the village on the far edge of the buffer zone.
   ``That's my home over there, you have no right to stop me,''
17-year-old Niki Avraamidou shouted, exhausted after trying
repeatedly to push through a line of U.N. troops.
   Erene Figuri, 60, holding her 9-year-old grandson Tofis by the
hand, argued angrily with Danish peacekeepers. Tofis slipped
through the cordon several times while the soldiers were scuffling
with older people, only to be chased and brought back each time.
   Other demonstrators sat at the edge of the buffer zone, singing
religious hymns and songs of yearning about their lost homes and
waving Greek and Cypriot flags and banners.
   ``Our right to return is not negotiable,'' said one huge cloth
banner.
   A series of U.N. resolutions on Cyprus call for the return of
the 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees expelled from their homes after
the Turkish invasion of 1974.
   The resolutions also demand the withdrawal of the 30,000 Turkish
troops and 35,000-50,000 Turkish mainland settlers brought to
northern Cyprus.
   The Turkish Cypriot leadership rejects the right of any of the
Greek Cypriot refugees to return. The buffer zone, which splits the
island, effectively prevents any contact between the two sides.
   It was the fourth attempt this year by Greek Cypriot refugees to
walk back to their homes.
   On two of the earlier attempts, refugees were beaten by Turkish
Cypriot police, arrested and jailed for ``illegal entry'' into the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, which was proclaimed unilaterally
in 1983 and has only been recognized by Turkey.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks between President George Vassiliou,
the Greek Cypriot leader, and Rauf Denktash, the president of the
breakaway state, have been deadlocked since June.

   Pro-democracy activists said Sunday they will
demonstrate in the city of Leipzig despite a Politburo statement
last week saying street demonstrations pose an obstacle to a
dialogue on reforms.
   Also Sunday, there was growing speculation that a meeting of the
ruling Politburo later this week could determine the political
future of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker.
   A high-ranking Lutheran Church official called on the government
to allow free elections by secret ballot and warned the Communist
leadership not to dismiss pro-democracy activists as ``enemies of
the state.''
   Activists in Leipzig said the protest would go ahead as planned
Monday night despite the Politburo statement condemning
demonstrations. Last Monday, more than 70,000 people took part in a
pro-democracy march in Leipzig, the largest single protest in
almost four decades.
   The demands for more freedom in this rigidly controlled country
have spurred more than 52,000 East Germans to go West in recent
months.
   The West German mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Sunday
that the Communist Party's Central Committee in East Berlin will
hold a special session this week that could formally decide
Honecker's future.
   Bild, quoting unidentified ``reliable sources'' in East Berlin,
said the meeting would be Thursday or Friday, following a session
of the Politburo set for Tuesday.
   Bild said its report would appear in Monday's editions of the
newspaper. The report was sent by telex to other news media in
advance of publication.
   Honecker has led the country as Communist Party chief since 1971.
   Party sources have said leaders in East Berlin are unhappy over
the way Honecker has handled the current unrest and that he has
lost support in the 163-seat Central Committee.
   Any final decision regarding Honecker's leadership role would
have to be approved by the Central Committee.
   Bild also reported that more than 20,000 East Germans, unhappy
over the leadership's rejection of reforms, have canceled their
party membership in the past two weeks.
   Lutheran Bishop Werner Leich called on the government to allow
free elections and urged all sides to refrain from violence.
   ``Future elections must serve the purpose of renewal and must
provide a clear choice by secret ballot of candidates and
(political) platforms,'' said Leich, who heads the East German
Lutheran Church Federation.
   Leich, in a pastoral letter, also appealed to East German
security officials to show restraint during peaceful pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   He said the government must open a dialogue with all levels of
society _ not just political groups and organizations already in
place.
   ``Critical voices cannot simply be dismissed as enemies of the
state, not even the new groups that have formed in our society,''
said Leich, referring to the growing pro-democracy movement in the
rigidly controlled nation of 16.6 million.
   Leich is also bishop of the Thueringen region in southwestern
East Germany.
   The 77-year-old Honecker has flatly refused to talk with
pro-democracy groups.

<HEAD>A Founder Of Postwar Communist Government Dies at 99</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michal Zymierski, a Polish independence
fighter who became a Soviet-backed member of the first postwar
Communist government, died Sunday. He was 99 and died in Warsaw,
the state PAP news agency said.
   Zymierski was an officer under Jozef Pilsudski seeking the
independence of Poland, which was won in 1918.
   According to an official biography, Zymierski then split with
Pilsudski and spent 1926 to 1931 as a political prisoner. His next
seven years were spent in France.
   During World War II, he became allied with the Soviet-backed
Communist resistance forces and was an organizer of the underground
Polish People's Army.
   He was a member of the first postwar government formed under
Soviet auspices on July 22, 1944, in Lublin.
   Known as the Lublin Committee, it was to form the core of the
future governments as the Communists, backed by Soviet leader Josef
Stalin, consolidated power in Poland. Key appointments were made
with Stalin's approval, with Zymierski taking charge of defense.
   Zymierski was given the rank of marshal of Poland, meaning the
head of the armed forces in case of war, in 1945. He was commander
of the army and minister of defense until 1949.
   Gradually falling from favor during the period of Stalinist
purges in Poland, Zymierski was relieved of the military command in
1949 and arrested and imprisoned from 1952 until 1955.
   After 1956 Zymierski was rehabilitated and given a senior
position in the National Bank of Poland. He retired in 1968.
   He was a member of the communist Polish United Workers Party
from its founding in 1948 and was on the Central Committee in the
early 1980s.
   Born in the southern city of Krakow, Zymierski studied law at
Jagiellonian University there.

   Hundreds more East Germans flocked to the
West German Embassy here over the weekend, bringing to more than
1,200 the number expected to leave for the West beginning Monday.
   The exodus also gained strength elsewhere. More than 2,100 East
Germans made their to West Germany over the weekend by escaping
through Hungary, which opened its western border to refugees Sept.
10.
   At the West German Embassy on a tree-lined street in Warsaw,
200-300 new refugees arrived over the weekend, diplomatic sources
said. That brought the total to more than 1,200.
   East German Trabant cars lined the street in front of the
embassy, and Poles continued to buy them at a brisk pace _ handing
cash to the refugees, taking the keys and driving off.
   East Germans were seen arriving throughout the day. In the
afternoon a group of refugees in the embassy compound were moved to
temporary shelter elsewhere.
   In a decision announced Saturday by the Polish state news agency
PAP, East Germany said the refugees will be allowed to obtain exit
documents in Warsaw and then travel directly to any country they
choose.
   It appeared that arrangements for the departure from Poland were
still being made Sunday. A West German official in Bonn said the
first departures could come Monday.
   Refugees said they were told West Germany was arranging
transport for them either by plane or ferry.
   Those arriving at the Warsaw embassy Sunday included a family
that persuaded East German authorities to let them travel to Poland
by presenting a holiday invitation from a Polish family.
   The father said he decided to leave because of the fierce police
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations that swept East Germany
during ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the country's
founding Oct. 7.
   The man said he was shocked by the repression.
   ``My protest was to leave,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Other refugees also cited police brutality as the trigger for
their flight from their homeland.
   Despite tighter restrictions imposed on East German travel
abroad in the wake of the refugee flood, hundreds escape daily and
make their way either to West Germany's embassies in Eastern Europe
or to Hungary.
   More than 52,000 East Germans have flooded into West Germany
since Sept. 10, and another 70,000 more have been allowed to
emigrate legally so far this year.

   Rockey Chapman and a few of his buddies
wanted to volunteer to pick up trash along a 3-mile stretch of road
in their hometown.
   So Chapman applied for his group to join the state's successful
``Adopt-A-Highway'' program, which credits volunteers with a sign
bearing their name and is placed along the strech of road they
spruced up.
   ``We were willing to pick up garbage a minimum of four times a
year,'' he said. ``In return, they would erect me a green and white
sign just like everyone else.''
   That's the rub. Chapman is the exalted cyclops of the Rockingham
County chapter of the Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Last weekend, he and the other volunteers wore their white robes
as they handed out leaflets in downtown Reidsville, a town of
12,400 near the Virginia border.
   State Department of Tranportation Secretary Jim Harrington
denied the KKK's request, saying it would be detrimental to the
program, which has become the largest of its kind in the nation.
   ``They (transportation officials) were afraid it would lead to
that part of the highway becoming more of a target of people
dumping a lot of trash for them to pick up,'' said North Carolina
Gov. Jim Martin, who supports Harrington's decision.
   Of the nearly 5,000 civic groups, businesses and neighborhoods
that have volunteered to adopt more than 10,000 miles of state
roads, only a handful had been turned down.
   One group was a rock band called the Sex Police and another was
a lingerie store called the Bra Patch. The department said earlier
this month the agency feared motorists would be offended by the
words ``sex'' and ``bra'' on the road signs that identify the
Adopt-A-Highway volunteers.
   But Chapman says that ``never in my wildest dreams did I think
they'd turn me down. I know enough about my constitutional rights
to know when they're being stepped on.''
   The North Carolina branch of the American Civil Liberties Union
agrees.
   ``We feel it is a violation of the Klan's First Amendment
rights,'' said Charlotte attorney Elizabeth Hodges, an ACLU board
member, on Friday. ``Regardless of what they stand for, we should
take on the case.''
   State ACLU Director James Shields said his organization would
come to the aid of any group whose constitutional rights were being
violated.
   ``If government is able to decide who gets to participate in a
program based upon government approval of their views, government
is doing a very Klan-like thing,'' he said.
   The ACLU will ask the state DOT to reconsider its decision. If
that fails, Shields said, a lawsuit could be filed in state or
federal court.
   Chapman, a welder, does not consider it ironic that the ACLU,
usually thought of as a liberal organization, came to his group's
assistance.
   ``I didn't even ask them why they did it because I already knew
the answer,'' he said. ``This is a First Amendment issue.''
   Some Reidsville residents said they felt the Klansmen were
entitled to join the program like anyone else.
   ``If they want to clean up the trash, let 'em,'' said Brenda
Wingfield, who was delivering phone books out of the back of her
pickup truck. ``Fair is fair. Who cares who cleans it up? I
certainly don't want to do it.''
   But Samuel E. Nunnally, the owner of a photography studio, was
indignant about the Klan's efforts.
   ``They've got such a bad name,'' he said. ``People would save up
their trash and throw it on their stretch of highway.''
   Nunnally, who is black, said the county was not ready for the
Klan to begin advertising itself like other civic organizations.
``They need to prove themselves for a few more years before they
get into something like this,'' he said.
   The governor suggested the KKK was ``about as interested in
creating a controversy over it ... as they are in cleaning it up.''
   Chapman, whose mobile home sports a Confederate flag in front,
agreed in part, saying it's a chance to get some good publicity for
his group and dispel ``a myth out there that we're still
hate-mongers.''
   ``We're a pro-white organization, just like the NAACP (National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People) is pro-black.''
   A youth group affiliated with the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People has adopted a highway in Wayne County
in eastern North Carolina.
   ``This isn't a matter of black and white,'' Chapman said. ``This
is a matter of rights.''

   After eight years, final Senate hearings on the
impeachment case against U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings are
tentatively set for this week, with a vote on whether to remove him
from office possible by week's end.
   Removal from the bench would be a form of ``living death,'' said
Hastings, who was acquitted in a jury trial, but he's anxious to
move ahead with his life.
   ``We are now talking in the ninth year of this matter,'' he said
in an interview. ``Everyone should be entitled to closure by now.
It's not in the best interests of Al Hastings (and) it does not
serve the community.''
   He noted the busy Southern District of Florida has been, in
effect, one judge short. He stopped hearing criminal cases last
year and hasn't presided in a civil trial since early summer, when
he was preparing for the inquiry by a special 12-member Senate
panel.
   A vote by two-thirds of the full Senate would be needed to
remove him from his $89,500-a-year job.
   He's ready to return to the bench ``with vigor,'' Hastings said,
or to begin a new job he refused to give any hints about.
   ``I have a plan to stay and a plan to go,'' said Hastings, 52,
appointed in 1979 by President Carter as Florida's first black
federal judge. ``I believe everyone knows that the system will not
cause me to roll over.''
   His problems began Oct. 9, 1981, when his friend William A.
Borders, a Washington attorney, was arrested in an undercover FBI
operation of alleged fixing of court cases. Borders was convicted
of bribery conspiracy, but Hastings was acquitted in a separate
1983 jury trial.
   However, a subsequent investigation led to Hastings' impeachment
last year in the House, which accused him of plotting to obtain a
bribe, lying during his trial defense and an unrelated charge of
disclosing federal wiretap information.
   Hastings said he thinks he has ``a good shot'' of remaining on
the bench.
   However, some senators expressed doubts about some of Hastings'
actions. Among those: his showing up at a restaurant, as Borders
had told an undercover agent Hastings would do, to signify Borders'
influence with him, and his efforts to avoid FBI agents in
Washington the night of Borders' arrest.
   Hastings said the Senate inquiry produced no ``smoking gun,'' no
strong new evidence against him.
   ``In fairness to anybody who is a detractor of mine, you could
say there is some persuasive evidence that one could infer that I
was guilty. But persuasive evidence has to be conclusive before you
pull that switch.''
   Hastings is the only federal official ever impeached after
acquittal in a trial and his attorneys argued for years that he was
being subjected to unconstitutional double jeopardy.
   ``You have to know that I'm the only person in America this has
happened to,'' he said.
   He continues to protest the use of a Senate panel, instead of
the full Senate, to hear his case. The panel then sent a report to
the other senators. The Senate, which says it's free to handle its
business as it sees fit, has in recent years used the panel system
to keep other Senate business from being halted by impeachment
cases.
   In recent months, Hastings has made speeches in 10 states and
dozens of Florida cities, explaining his case and urging people to
write their senators. Ken Klein, spokesman for Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., said Graham's office has answered 1,400 letters, most in
Hastings' support.
   ``It has been difficult,'' Hastings said. ``But if it is next
week or next month, when the dust settles, I will be standing tall
with dignity.''

   U.S. officials were questioning an American airman
after authorities allegedly caught him passing military secrets to
two Soviet officers in West Berlin, a U.S. official said Sunday.
   Anthony Sariti, a spokesman for the U.S. mission in West Berlin,
said the soldier, identified only as a U.S. Air Force airman, was
cooperating with authorities after the incident late Saturday.
   ``Two Soviet majors were also apprehended last night as they
were involved with the airman, who was passing them classified
defense information,'' Sariti said.
   He refused to elaborate on the nature of the material or where
the meeting took place in West Berlin.
   Sariti said the Soviet officers were questioned and then
returned to ``the Soviet sector'' in East Berlin.
   He said U.S. officials lodged a verbal protest with the Soviets
on Saturday night and would follow with a formal written protest on
Monday.

   The government announced a shake-up
of six key posts in the military Sunday, twelve days after the
botched coup against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The announcement, made on a television broadcast, said Maj.
Rafael Cedeno was named state security chief. Cedeno, who has
worked as an assistant to Noriega, replaced Col. Guillermo Wong,
who was detained as a result of the Oct. 3 uprising.
   Wong, along with other high officials, allegedly was involved in
the attempt.
   Noriega held the same post from 1971 until 1983, when he became
head of the 15,000-man Defense Forces.
   Maj. Anibal Maylin is the new head of Panama's police, some of
whose units also were involved in the coup attempt. Lt. Col.
Roberto Armijo, who was chief of police when the uprising occurred,
will become head of a military post.
   Maj. Mario A. del Cid was named head of the second military zone
and Capt. Rafael Jurado will control the Peace Batallion stationed
along the northern border with Costa Rica.
   Capt. Asuncion Gaitan Rios will serve as head of Panama's
special forces. He previously headed a military training school.
   Military sources have said that various units were slow to come
to Noriega's aid on Oct. 3 and leaders of those units are being
replaced.
   Eleven soldiers died in the uprising, and five are known to have
fled to Fort Clayton, a U.S. base. At least 37 soldiers are known
to have been arrested.

   A jury rejected an insanity defense
Sunday in the second phase of the trial of an 18-year-old already
convicted of first-degree murder in the ax slayings of his parents
and two siblings.
   David Brom, a 16-year-old high school sophomore at the time of
the deaths, knew what he was doing and knew it was wrong, the jury
ruled in completing Minnesota's two-part trial system for insanity
pleas.
   ``Obviously we're very pleased with the verdict. We had
anticipated that the law was in favor of this verdict,'' said
prosecutor Ray Schmitz, the Olmsted County attorney. He said he
would urge the judge to give Brom the maximum sentence of 70 years
in prison on each count.
   Brom, surrounded by sheriff's deputies, showed no emotion when
the verdict was announced. One female juror appeared to be trying
to keep from crying.
   Sentencing was set for Monday.
   If Judge Ancy Morse sentences Brom to consecutive sentences on
the convictions, Brom will have no possibility of parole until the
year 2059. However, if she judge orders sentences on the four
murder counts to run concurrently, Brom would be eligible for
parole in 17 years.
   Defense attorney Terrence Walters said he was not surprised by
the verdict, but said that after 21{ hours of deliberation over
three days, ``I felt I had a fighting chance.''
   An appeal is automatic in first-degree murder convictions.
   Brom was described as a gentle boy who wrote poetry but also
liked hard-core rock music with violent overtones.
   He had pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness in the
February 1988 deaths at the family's rural Rochester home. The
first phase of the trial, which began Sept. 18, ended Oct. 3 _
Brom's 18th birthday _ with jurors finding Brom guilty of four
counts of first-degree murder.
   In the second phase, the jury was asked to decide whether Brom
was aware of what he was doing and knew it was wrong at the time of
the murders.
   During the second phase of the trial, jurors heard often
conflicting testimony from several psychiatrists concerning Brom's
sanity at the time of the killings.
   All the psychiatrists agreed that Brom suffered from a major
mental illness, but only one of five psychiatrists testified that
Brom met Minnesota's legal standard of insanity.

<HEAD>Darman Says Automatic Budget Cuts Would Be Good Medicine For Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House budget chief said Sunday it
might be best if Congress leaves in place automatic spending cuts
that take effect Monday night rather than follow the past practice
of rolling them back.
   The $16 billion cut, formally known as a sequestration, is
automatic under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman Act that was designed to
force the president and Congress to reduce the federal deficit.
This year, Congress and the administration failed to find a
compromise.
   ``I think it may be that sequester is the best available
alternative. At least it is real,'' said Richard Darman, director
of the White House Office of Management and Budget.
   The automatic budget cuts of Gramm-Rudman took effect in 1986
and 1987 as well, but Congress acted quickly to restore the lost
funds, a process that Darman called ``phony.''
   ``This time, if it goes into effect, I think it would be good if
people would live with it and say, `don't restore the cuts,'''
Darman said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said he thought Congress and President Bush could agree
on a formula similar to a Senate package passed last Friday that
met the Gramm-Rudman targets.
   The failure to meet those targets, said Panetta, was linked to
the sharp drop in stock prices Friday.
   ``I think there is a relationship because I think that for the
last eight to 10 years, we've been essentially on a debt binge in
this country,'' Panetta said on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the
Press.''
   The federal debt has reached $3.1 trillion, and corporate and
personal debt also have soared, he said.
   ``In Washington ... we've reached a point where we simply don't
have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough
choices,'' he said.
   An author of the Gramm-Rudman law, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
rebutted criticism by some members of Congress that the bill had
led the government to engage in deceptive accounting practices and
had exacerbated the deficit.
   ``The bottom line is, under Gramm-Rudman, we've cut the deficit
in half. We've cut the rate of growth in federal spending in half.
And the federal government has gotten smaller relative to the
private sector of the economy,'' he said.
   ``Has the Congress cheated? And has the president, in the best
spirit of bipartisanship, worked with Congress to cheat? The answer
is yes,'' said Gramm. ``But are we better off with Gramm-Rudman
than we would be without it? I think the answer is, clearly, yes.''

<HEAD>Party To Purge Hostile Elements, Businessmen</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with party voting to purge hostile elements
and wealthy businessmen. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders in the Beijing Communist Party voted
Sunday to purge the party of ``hostile and anti-party elements''
and wealthy private businessmen, whom they called exploiters.
   The decision, reported by the official Xinhua News Agency,
indicated that the harsh crackdown triggered by student protests in
June is not winding down after nearly five months, but rather will
be intensified.
   Also Sunday, an official report said lawmakers have proposed
banning Hong Kong residents from anti-government activities after
the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Xinhua said the Beijing party committee, which has led the
nation in hard-line rhetoric, approved a resolution to ``purify the
party organizations'' by requiring all members in the city to
reregister during the coming year.
   Only those who meet party qualifications will be retained, it
said.
   ``A drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how party
members, especially officials with a party membership, behaved in
ending the national turmoil and quelling the anti-government
rioting,'' it said, referring to pro-democracy protests that the
army crushed in June.
   ``The overwhelming majority of the party members will be united
and educated and a very small number of hostile and anti-party
elements will be resolutely purged from the party,'' it said.
   It did not say how many of Beijing's 10 million residents are
party members or how many are expected to survive the examination.
So far, only a few expulsions from the party have been announced,
including that of Yan Jiaqi, a political scientist who fled to the
West in June and is working to organize an opposition from overseas.
   Former party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, ousted for allegedly
supporting the student protests, has been allowed to keep his party
membership, but some top officials are believed to be pressing for
his expulsion. He already has lost all his party posts.
   Leading targets of the party purge include private businessmen,
whom the resolution referred to as ``exploiters.''
   ``The resolution stipulated that exploiters cannot be admitted
into the party, and those who have already been party members must
adhere to the party's ideals,'' it said.
   ``Besides getting their own due pay, they should spend their
post-tax profits on production and public welfare and should not
use them for their own private needs. If they fail to do so, they
can no longer be party members,'' it said.
   Private businessmen were commonly described as ``exploiters''
during the first three decades of Communist rule, but after senior
leader Deng Xiaoping began reforming the centralized economy a
decade ago, they were embraced as partners in China's
modernization. At least one millionaire has been admitted to the
party.
   Since the June crackdown on the student movement, however,
hard-line policies have made a comeback in all areas. The slogan of
Deng's early reforms, ``To get rich is glorious,'' has been
dropped, and party leaders have begun criticizing private
businessmen for becoming wealthy.
   Some cities have put limits on how much self-employed
businessmen can pay themselves, and tax officials have been ordered
to make sure private businessmen pay what they owe.
   Many private clothing sellers and bar owners in Beijing have
said they want to sell their businesses.
   The resolution also said the party will examine officials at all
levels and make any changes it considers necessary.
   ``Political integrity will be emphasized in choosing and
appointing officials in the future,'' it said.
   The Beijing party committee has heard a series of hard-line
speeches in the past few days from its head, Li Ximing, including a
call Thursday for direct party decision-making in universities and
at the most local level of government.
   The Hong Kong proposal, the latest in a series of statements by
the government about its future rule there, was likely to add to
fears that have caused tens of thousands of residents to flee the
British colony.
   The legislators, members of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, also reiterated the government position
that China will have the right to station troops in Hong Kong and
declare a state of emergency there.

   When 8-year-old Jennifer Georgis put on a
pair of old police handcuffs, she had no idea what the menacing
manacles would do.
   Four hours after first trying to take off the cuffs, which
tightened as she moved, she found out.
   Minot's rescue squad was called and emergency workers brought
bolt cutters.
   ``The bolt cutters, they were right against the skin,'' Jennifer
said.
   ``The first thing I did when they cut the chain was go to the
bathroom,'' which she couldn't do while cuffed because she was
wearing a one-piece, button-down jumpsuit.
   Jennifer found the cuffs in a desk drawer, ``where she wasn't
supposed to be,'' her mother said, Janet Georgis.
   The cuffs belonged to the girl's father, Stephen Georgis, a
former police officer with the U.S. Air Force. But the keys had
been lost.

<HEAD>Soviet Rail Depots and Ports Clogged With Unloaded Cargo</HEAD>

   Thousands of tons of goods urgently needed to ease
widespread shortages are sitting at rail stations and food
shipments are rotting for lack of people and equipment to move the
cargo, Soviet media reported Sunday.
   Strikes and sheer mismanagement were blamed for the transport
jam, which has exacerbated shortages and threatened to derail
perestroika, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov warned on national television Sunday
night that ``if things do not improve shortly, we'll have to take
tough measures against leaders of all ranks.''
   More than 2 million tons of cargo are piled up in Soviet ports
for lack of train transport, newspapers said. This includes
thousands of containers of consumer goods and food purchased by the
government on an emergency basis to appease a public angered by
empty store shelves.
   Ryzhkov said the unloaded cargo included 25,000 tons of imported
food and that some of it was spoiling.
   The news agency Tass reported that 1,700 trains were stalled for
lack of coal, even though the country's first nationwide coal
strike ended two months ago. As of Wednesday, 100,000 railcars were
out of circulation, Tass said, quoting Railroad Minister Nikolai
Konarev.
   In the critical harvest season, key rail depots are clogged with
180 cars of meat rotting in the Leningrad depots alone, media said.
Incoming trains are waiting for unloading, and outgoing cargo is
piled up for lack of empty containers and railcars.
   ``The work of the Leningrad rail center is effectively
paralyzed,'' the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported Thursday. ``All
the approaches to stations for dozens of kilometers around the
city, all the cargo yards and sorting stations are packed with
unloaded freight cars.''
   The Leningrad traffic jam began when Byelorussian farms began
shipping potatoes faster than the city's vegetable warehouses could
take them in, the paper said. Rail authorities finally managed to
deal with the glut of potatoes, but now refrigerated cars, oil
tankers, auto-transport wagons and flatbed cars for containers are
backing up.
   The Soviet Union has long had difficulty transporting its
harvest to storage and shops. Tass reported this week that 29
million tons of grain, one million tons of meat and 25 percent of
vegetables are lost each year between field and table.
   This year, the annual difficulties are exacerbated by strikes in
the Caucasus and Moldavia regions spawned by ethnic conflicts.
Trains have not run for 18 days in Moldavia in a language dispute,
said Tass, quoting Valentin Tetenov, a legislator who heads the
Supreme Soviet transportation committee.
   Rail traffic to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, was halted from
Sept. 5 to Sept. 17, and sporadically since then, in an economic
blockade mounted by Azerbaijanis as part of the lengthy dispute
over rights to the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
   Rail officials apparently continued to load trains and send them
to Armenia even though they knew the line was closed, because at
one point, 400 trains were reported stuck on the tracks to Yerevan.
   Moscow's Smolensk Cargo Depot was piled high with containers
Sunday afternoon, including some shipped from West Germany nearly
five weeks ago and one sent from Hungary in June. The lone worker
on the scene said factories were not sending trucks to pick up
their shipments.
   ``Who knows why?'' he shrugged.
   In the Vladimir region, 300 containers are stacked in the rail
depot, because so many trucks have broken down for lack of spare
parts. The critical parts are somewhere in the mountain of cargo,
the news program Vremya said Saturday.
   The Ukraine has closed one sugar beet processing plant and may
have to close 30 more at the height of the harvest because the
warehouses are full and there are no railcars to haul the sugar,
the labor newspaper Trud reported Sunday. Sugar is rationed in the
Soviet Union, primarily because it is used for making moonshine.
   Trud quoted the head of the Ukrainian Council of Trade Unions,
V. Sologub, as saying 280,000 tons of cargo has piled up at the
port in Odessa, and factory workers are being drafted into
stevedore duty.

<HEAD>First Meeting in Seven Decades Considers Kurdish Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi politician Sunday was hounded from the
podium by cries of ``war criminal'' at the first international
conference in nearly 70 years on the Kurdish people, whose ancient
Middle East homeland straddles four countries.
   The two-day conference focused attention on human rights abuses
suffered by the Kurds, an ethnic minority of about 20 million
people spread across Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.
   Held under the auspices of France-Liberty, a human rights
foundation set up by First Lady Danielle Mitterrand, the conference
drew 300 participants from 36 countries, including U.S. Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and Lord Eric Avebury, chairman of the British
Parliamentary Human Rights Group.
   ``Innocent women and children have suffered and been tortured,''
Yelena Bonner, wife of Soviet physicist and Nobel Peace Prize
winner Andrei Sakharov, said Saturday in remarks at the start of
the conference.
   But, she added, ``if we conducted a poll in Moscow, only one in
100 people would know of the problems of the people in Kurdistan.''
   Conference organizers hoped the meeting would raise
international awareness.
   They passed resolutions asking for a fact-finding mission to be
sent from the West to examine human rights abuses in Kurdish areas.
They also called on the U.N. General Assembly to hold a special
session to examine the Kurdish question.
   Among the worst abuses noted by conference participants was last
year's chemical-weapons offensive launched by Iraq against Kurdish
strongholds in the northern part of the country.
   Thousands of people died, including many women and children, and
up to 100,000 others fled to Iran and Turkey, according to the U.S.
State Department.
   Kurdish leaders accuse Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of
genocide and many of those at the conference threatened to walk out
when Bahaddin Ahmet, president of the Kurdish Parliament of Iraq,
tried to take the podium.
   Kurdish leaders in Iraq accused members of the Kurdish
Parliament, set up by the Iraqi government in 1974, of being
collaborators.
   ``A war criminal is speaking here!'' cried Jalal Talabani,
leader of the resistance group, People's United Kurdistan Party of
Iraq.
   Talabani seized the podium and the Iraqi delegation withdrew.
   The resistance group accuses Iraq of destroying nearly 4,000
Kurdish villages and relocating 220,000 Kurdish families to other
parts of Iraq during a 15-year effort to ``Arabize'' oil-rich parts
of the country.
   The situation in Iraq, Kurdish spokesmen say, is the most
dramatic example of the plight of the Kurds.
   Descended from the ancient Medes who occupied the area that is
now Iran, most Kurds are Sunni Moslems who speak their own language.
   The 200,000 square miles they occupy and call Kurdistan has,
over the centuries, been ruled by Arabs, Mongols, and Turks of the
Ottoman Empire.
   When the Ottoman Empire was defeated at the end of World War I,
the Allied Powers dismembered it and granted the Kurds autonomy
under the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. The portion of the treaty giving
autonomy to the group was never carried out and Kurdish nationalist
aspirations were subjugated by colonial interests.
   About 10 million Kurds live in Turkey, 5.5 million in Iran, 3.5
million in Iraq and about a million in Syria. Kurds number 650,000
in Western Europe, 320,000 in the Soviet Union and 100,000 in
Lebanon. About 3,000 live in the United States.

a Southern Command spokesman.
   Ormsbee provided no further details except to say that the

   An attempt to quietly remove a nearly
century-old stone monument honoring white supremacists has sparked
racial tensions and threatens federal funds for a construction
project, officials said.
   City officials said the 20-foot obelisk must be removed because
of road construction and because of commercial development of the
area near the monument.
   ``They're lying in their teeth,'' said Wayne Ponthieux of Boh
Brothers Construction Co. Inc., foreman of the crew doing the
street work. ``I can work all around that monument. That monument
does not have to be touched.''
   None of the street work comes closer than 15 feet, he said.
   Streets Director Betty Jo Everett, who said that the move was
forced by road work, said later last week that electrical and
traffic engineers told her the obelisk might be damaged by the work.
   The monument also could block the view of traffic signals that
will be installed after the road work is done, she said.
   ``It would be a safety hazard in the way that we have redesigned
the intersection,'' said Everett. ``When uses change over the
years, you have to make decisions for the safety of the public,
both pedestrians and drivers.''
   Erected in 1891, the monument bears the names of 16 people, all
members of the White League, who died in a brief, bloody battle in
1874 between the white supremacist group and the Reconstruction
government.
   An inscription added in 1932 says, ``United States troops took
over the state government and reinstated the usurpers but the
national election in November 1876 recognized white supremacy and
gave us our state.''
   It's the second time in eight years that an official in this
predominantly black city has tried to remove the pointed pillar
officially called the Liberty Place Monument.
   Everett said she gave the order to remove the monument without
consulting Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who is running for re-election
in February 1990. Barthelemy has not publicly commented on the
situation.
   While the road work continues, the order to remove the obelisk
was put on hold until officials decide where it should go and
whether moving it would violate federal law.
   Glenn Montecino, an aide to lawmaker and former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke, said moving the obelisk could mean the
construction project will lose federal funds since it could be a
candidate for the National Register of Historic Places.
   Although the monument isn't yet on the National Register,
federal rules require preservation officials be consulted before
work starts at a site that might qualify for the register, said
Leslie P. Tassin, Louisiana's historic preservation officer.
   In the 1970s, blacks demanded removal of the monument, which had
long been and continues to be a rallying point for white
supremacists. Their demands were rejected, but a plaque repudiating
the references to white supremacy was added in 1974.
   Former Mayor Dutch Morial, the city's first black mayor,
advertised in 1981 for a firm to remove the monument from the
center of a tiny traffic circle. The City Council said the obelisk
had to stay, but agreed to let the 1932 inscriptions be removed.
   They were filled in, whitewashed over, and covered up. But the
covers since have been removed, leaving bolts sticking out from
partly erased inscriptions. The 1974 plaque also is nowhere to be
seen.
   Morial's move, like Everett's order, sparked challenges from the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, founded
by Duke.
   Duke, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
founded the NAAWP after repudiating the Klan. He was elected last
February to the state Legislature.
   The NAAWP held a small protest at the monument Saturday in which
about 20 people showed up. The group said it would be satisfied if
the city assured it the monument would be erected somewhere within
the 10 blocks covered by the Battle of Liberty, said NAAWP member
Callie O'Pry.

<HEAD>NTSB, FAA Inspectors Probe Charred 727; Delta Crew Praised or Quick
Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of federal inspectors arrived
Sunday to investigate a fire that gutted much of a parked Delta
Airlines Boeing 727 and burned a gaping hole in its fuselage.
   Five crew members and one passenger were treated for smoke
inhalation and released after Saturday's fire at a boarding gate at
Salt Lake International Airport.
   The investigation, assisted by representatives of Delta and
Boeing, should take three or four days, said Bob Johnson, regional
director for the National Transportation Safety Board in Denver.
   He said early indications were that the fire broke out in an
area of the belly of the fuselage, below and behind the cockpit,
where the plane's computer and aviation electronics are housed.
   The top of the plane's forward fuselage was scarred by a gaping
black hole roughly 4 feet wide and 15 feet long that appeared to
nearly sever the front third of the plane.
   Johnson and Delta officials praised the crew of Flight 1558 for
their cool, quick evacuation of the plane and the firefighters who
surrounded the aircraft within minutes of the first alarm.
   Nine passengers and six crew members were on board when smoke,
following a loud pop, began billowing from a vent in the
first-class section.
   ``We're all fortunate with how the circumstances came about,''
Fred Rollins, Delta's district director of marketing, said Sunday.
``The crew was there and ready, they acted very rapidly. They were
very, very efficient. ... There was no panic, no pushing or
screaming or anything.''
   The plane, just in from Los Angeles, had been scheduled to
depart Salt Lake City for Edmonton, Alberta, with 86 passengers.
Passengers were put on another Delta flight to Edmonton.
   Johnson said the airport's fire units responded with
``exceptional'' speed. He credited a ground-crew member and the
airport control tower for rushing firefighters to the scene.
   ``My understanding is that there was a mechanic on the outside
of the airplane, and he first observed the fire and he was equipped
with a radio, so he was able to assist in the initial notification
quickly,'' Johnson said.
   Control tower personnel noticed the smoke about the same time,
he added.
   Firefighters extinguished the flames within 15 minutes,
authorities said.
   While the NTSB team triesto nail down the cause of the fire,
Delta officials will determine whether the $30 million airplane can
eventually be returned to service.
   ``It's too early to determine if it's reparable. That depends on
the analysis by structural engineers and further investigation,''
Rollins said.
   He had no dollar estimate for damages.
   Rollins said he did not know the plane's age, but Delta's fleet
has an average age of 8.4 years.

   An ammonia leak at a pizza plant prompted
the all-night evacuation of this entire town of 6,500 people and
left four people hospitalized Sunday, authorities said.
   An evacuation order was lifted shortly after 5:00 a.m. Sunday
morning, said Wellston Assistant Fire Chief Bob Long.
   ``We had some fog that moved in last night _ it was keeping the
ammonia smell around parts of town,'' Long said. ``The sun dried it
up.''
   Deadly anhydrous ammonia used for refrigeration at the Pillsbury
Co. Jenno's plant began leaking about 8 p.m. Saturday when a
compressor cap blew off a 16-inch pipe inside the plant, said Mayor
John Carey. The evacuation of the town was ordered at 10:30 p.m.
and the leak was contained by 11 p.m.
   About 50 people were taken to area hospitals Saturday night and
early Sunday. Most were given oxygen treatments and released, said
Vinton County Deputy Sheriff Marc Smith on Sunday. Dozens of other
residents were given oxygen treatment by emergency medical units
and paramedics Saturday night.
   ``They all wanted to know if their lungs were going to blow
up,'' Smith said. ``They slept everywhere last night, in their
cars, they were all over the place.''
   Mike Dalton, spill unit supervisor of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said EPA and plant officials did not immediately
know how much ammonia escaped or how much was in the system.
   ``Once the plant has made the repairs, then they'll recharge and
determine how much they lost,'' Dalton said.
   Wellston policeman Marvin Bates, 26, and Jeno's employee Evelyn
Gilliland, 39, were in fair condition at Holtzer Medical Center,
said a nursing supervisor who did not give her name.
   Ronnie Russell, 27, and William Fisher, 36, were also in fair
condition at Oak Hill Community Hospital, said nursing supervisor
Betty McFann.
   Elderly people and nursing home residents were advised not to
return until later Sunday morning to give the cloud time to
dissipate completely, Long said. Residents of the town's two
nursing homes, Edgewood Manor and the Jenkins Memorial Health
Center, were returned to the homes by about 9 a.m. Sunday, he said.
   Evacuees were taken by school bus to two schools in the nearby
towns of Hamden and McArthur and to a community center in McArthur,
said Ethel Gussler, a dispatcher at the Vinton County sheriff's
department.
   Police and sheriff's deputies said no looting was reported
following the evacuation.
   Employees from Jeno's sanitation division returned to work early
Sunday, Dalton said. The plant manufactures frozen pizzas.
   Environmental damage from the leak appeared to be minimal, he
said. Inspectors had feared that the ammonia would dissolve into
water in streams, storm drains and sanitary sewers. Dalton said
ammonia can kill fish and the bacteria used at sewage treatment
plants to break down raw sewage.
   Runoff from the plant was contained in a diversion ditch around
the plant and did not reach streams, he said.
   ``Anhydrous ammonia reacts with liquid in your lungs, changes
form, then attacks tissues. It can directly suffocate you,'' Dalton
said.
   Wellston is about 90 miles southeast of Columbus.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with Shamir aide saying talks should be a lower level
but not necessarily in Israel, 3-year-old dying from bullet wound, soldier
sentenced for killing two Palestinians. EDITS to trim; no pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Underground leaders of the Arab uprising on
Sunday rejected a U.S. plan to arrange talks between Israelis and
Palestinians, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opposed the idea of
holding such talks in Cairo.
   Shamir said he preferred lower-level talks than those proposed
by the United States and that they should be held in Israel.
   Security forces killed a Palestinian and wounded three others
during protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Arab
reports said a Palestinian accused of collaborating with Israel was
killed by masked activists.
   The latest deaths brought to 595 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians during the 22-month-old
uprising; another 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs
as suspected collaborators. Forty Israelis also have died in the
violence.
   A U.S. plan formulated by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
is designed to bring about a meeting in Cairo urged by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak as a way to bridge differences between
Israel and the PLO.
   The underground Palestinian leadership, in its 47th leaflet
since the start of the rebellion in December 1987, said it
``rejects America's suspicious role, primarily James Baker's five
points.''
   Baker's plan calls for consultations between the Israeli and
Egyptian foreign ministers to agree on the makeup of a Palestinian
delegation for the proposed Cairo meeting.
   Mubarak urged the meeting as a way to revive Israel's stalled
peace initiative, which calls for elections among Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza to pick delegates to negotiate with Israel
on interim self-rule.
   The leaflet from the uprising's PLO-backed leadership said
Baker's ideas merely supported Shamir's election plan and were a
way to avoid the international peace conference that the PLO wants.
The uprising leaders already have rejected the Shamir plan.
   In an interview with the independent daily Maariv, Shamir said
he saw no reason to meet in Cairo.
   ``Why go to Cairo, when the two sides, Israeli and Palestinian,
are here?'' Shamir asked.
   He said the meeting should be in Israel and that it should
merely be a gathering of technocrats to iron out details of his
election plan.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner later said the prime minister did not
mean that such talks could only be held in Israel but was ``just
raising different possibilites.''
   But he said Shamir does wants to lower the profile of the
contacts.
   ``You cannot conduct high-level meetings in the limelight
because it is difficult to get results,'' Pazner said.
   Also Sunday, a military court sentenced a reserve soldier to two
years in prison for causing the death of two Palestinians in May
1988, the army said.
   Army raido said Ilan Orev, 25, was chasing stone-throwers in the
West Bank village of Bani Naim when he knelt, took aim and fired
two bullets into the heads of two rioters, in violation of orders
not to open fire.
   Late Sunday, 3-year-old Attiyah el-Ghurani of the Shati refugee
camp died of a gunshot injury he suffered on Thursday, the army
said.
   Officials at Shifa hospital in Gaza said the boy's skull had
been shattered by a rubber-coated metal pellet fired by Israeli
soldiers.
   The army said at the time that its troops had not opened fire in
the area but that it was checking further. An army spokesman said
Sunday that no new details were available.

   Tens of thousands of abortion-rights
supporters, buoyed by recent legal and political victories, marched
through downtown San Francisco to a rally in front of City Hall on
Sunday.
   Across the continent in Trenton, N.J., several thousand
demonstrators chanted, waved banners and marched on the Statehouse
to tell lawmakers not to tamper with their right to a safe and
legal abortion.
   The San Francisco marchers, about three-fourths of them women,
carried signs proclaiming the right to choose abortion and, in some
cases, denouncing President Bush for his anti-abortion stand.
   ``A lot of the younger generation felt the right was safe, but
now it's threatened,'' said Alice Wallace, 70, of San Francisco,
who wore a ``Retain Choice!'' sign on her back. ``I think the
politicians will be hearing it.''
   Police estimated the crowd at 30,000. March coordinator Jessica
Braverman said the turnout was 45,000 to 60,000. No anti-abortion
demonstrators were seen along the route.
   After parading past friendly onlookers along more than a mile of
Market Street, the city's main boulevard, marchers gathered in
front of City Hall for a rally and speeches by politicians.
   Some of the loudest cheers were for Norma McCorvey, the Texas
woman who was ``Jane Roe'' in the 1973 Supreme Court ruling
legalizing abortion.
   The march, organized by California's National Organization for
Women Chapter and the Bay Area Pro-Choice Coalition, came on the
heels of several developments favorable to the abortion-rights
cause around the nation.
   Last week Congress, for the first time since 1981, voted to fund
Medicaid abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest,
despite a veto threat by Bush. Earlier in the week the Florida
Legislature rejected attempts by Gov. Bob Martinez to tighten
restrictions on abortion.
   The Florida Supreme Court and a California Court of Appeal have
blocked enforcement this month of state laws that would require
parental consent for minors' abortions. And Democratic candidates
for governor in Virginia and New Jersey have used their
abortion-rights stands to gain on their Republican opponents,
according to opinion polls.
   Also on Sunday, Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin in Washington
unveiled an unusual plea to the Supreme Court from 10 governors
urging the justices to reject efforts to restrict abortions.
   A number of San Francisco marchers said a recent Supreme Court
ruling giving states more authority to restrict abortion had
galvanized pro-choice sentiment.
   ``People didn't think their right to choose was threatened. Now,
with the Webster (Supreme Court) ruling, they're aware of the
threat,'' said Lita Krowech of Oakland, whose T-shirt read, ``U.S.
Out of My Uterus.''
   Several signs called for U.S. approval of RU-486, the French
abortion-inducing pill.
   The New Jersey gathering Sunday drew about 6,500, state police
estimated. Rally organizers said 10,000 people participated.
   Demonstrators filled the street in front of the Statehouse and
drew national women's rights leaders, who said the nation is
watching the New Jersey governor's race. They told the crowd that
lawmakers will begin chipping away at abortion rights unless
pro-choice voices are heard in every state.
   ``You will set the standard for the 1990s. You will prove to
candidates across the country _ if you're out of touch, you could
be out of office,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
   Anti-abortion forces staged a small demonstration about a block
away. On Saturday, 116 people were arrested in Chicago and 69 in
Boston during anti-abortion demonstrations outside clinics.

   Relatives of Raoul Wallenberg planned to meet
Monday with Soviet officials in hopes of learning the fate of the
Swede who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi
extermination, then vanished after Soviet troops arrested him in
1945.
   Wallenberg's half-sister Nina Lagergren and half-brother Guy von
Dardel arrived in Moscow Sunday. They were accompanied by the
chairman and the secretary of the Stockholm-based Raoul Wallenberg
Association, retired diplomat Per Anger and Sonja Sonnefeld.
   They dined Sunday night at the Swedish Embassy in Moscow, an
embassy spokesman said.
   The group was to meet Monday with Deputy Foreign Secretary V.
Nikiforov and deputy chairman of the KGB, V. Pirozhkov. They also
will examine Soviet files on Wallenberg.
   The Soviets say files discovered in 1957 showed that Wallenberg
died of natural causes in prison 10 years earlier.
   But numerous accounts over the years from other prisoners
indicate he was alive in Soviet prisons and labor camps long after
the official report of his death. If alive, he would be 77 years
old.
   On Sunday, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published an
interview with an official of the Butyrskaya Prison who said that
prison records show Wallenberg was not held there between 1972 and
1980. A man named Yan Kaplan reported he had seen Wallenberg in the
prison hospital in 1975.

<TEXT>
   A reform group once controlled by the
now-defunct Communist Party on Sunday nominated Justice Minister
Kalman Kulcsar to run for president, officials said.
   The Patriotic People's Front, made up of union, youth, women's
and other groups, also elected the 61-year-old Kulcsar as chairman
at a two-day congress that ended Sunday. He has been at the
forefront of democratic reform in Hungary.
   The presidential election, tentatively set for Nov. 25, would be
the country's first free national balloting in 41 years.
Legislative elections are promised by June next year.
   Kulcsar is the fourth candidate to be nominated for president,
after Imre Pozsgay, the country's best known reformer, Zoltan
Kiraly of the Social Democratic Party and Sandor Racz.
   Racz was nominated last month by a small fringe group named the
Hungarian October Party, which says it wants to realize the goals
of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising.
   Pozsgay was nominated for president in June by the Communist
Party, which renamed itself the Hungarian Socialist Party last
weekend at a historic party congress that pledged to work for
democratic reforms.
   The new office of president is expected to be created this week
when Parliament takes up proposed legislation.
   Under the proposed bill, parties and individuals could put up a
candidate provided they acquire 50,000 signatures and deliver them
to the national electoral committee 20 days before the balloting.
   The election for the presidency is tentatively set for Nov. 25.
The new office will replace the current largely ceremonial post of
``president of the presidential council'' held by Bruno F. Straub.
   Under proposed constitutional changes, the office of president
would be vested with much greater powers than the post. Pozsgay has
said the new president should not be able to hold any party job.

   It's a smoke-filled nightclub, crowded with
small tables covered with checkered tableclothes, when the
diminutive Woody Allen appears with his beloved clarinet in hand.
   It's not a scene from his next movie but a weekly jazz jam
session featuring the Oscar-winning filmmaker.
   For the past 18 years, Allen has appeared regularly on Monday
nights at Michael's Pub in Manhattan to play such New Orleans tunes
as ``In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree.''
   Allen says he is grateful for the influence music has had on his
life.
   ``It's the best life I can think of if you're a really talented
musician because communication in music is so emotional in every
way,'' Allen said in the Oct. 23 issue of Time magazine.
   Playing and practicing the clarinet is something of an
obsession, he says.
   ``There have been times when I would film all day long and
wouldn't get to my hotel room until 10:30 at night,'' Allen said.
``So I would get into bed and pull the quilt up over my head so I
wouldn't offend the neighbors.''
   Allen missed the 1978 Academy Awards in which he won an Oscar
for the movie ``Annie Hall'' so he could make his weekly gig.

   Galveston Island, a barrier coast off the Texas coast, was
struck by the deadliest hurricane on record in September 1900.
   The powerful storm sent a wall of water washing over the island,
and some called it the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.
   The death toll from that storm isn't certain, but experts
generally agree it easily topped 6,000. Some accounts placed the
number of people killed at 8,000.
   The storm caused damage estimated at $30 million and $40 million.
   Fifteen years later, in August, another hurricane hit Galveston.
The official death toll was estimated at 275, much lower than the
great 1900 storm.
   That's because storm-wary residents had raised the grade of the
island and built a seawall to protect them from surging tides
blamed for most of the deaths. Still, damage from the 1915 storm
was set at $50 million.

   During this season of the Martha Graham Dance
Company, short dances by some of the company members are being
shown. Even on those programs, most of the evening has dances
created by Miss Graham, who is 95.
   The more interesting of the ``Martha and ... New
Choreographers'' programs this past week at the City Center had
Steve Rooks dancing his own solo, a love duet choreographed by
Jacqulyn Buglisi and Maxine Sherman doing her own abstract solo.
   Rooks' solo, ``Outside,'' has a text from the gospel of Matthew
printed in the program so the audience knew what he was driving at.
Rooks also conveyed it clearly in his dance. There was not only
weeping and gnashing of teeth but fear, flight _ which he managed
to suggest by flinging himself in circles instead of running,
supplication as humble as a dog's begging and despair. It was a
tour de force.
   Joyce Herring and Donlin Foreman danced ``Sospiri,'' which was
totally a beautiful love duet. It included, at different times, a
spiritual sense and graphic embraces.
   Program notes for Maxine Sherman's ``Watermark'' say that the
mystery and virtue of fidelity will unfold. Miss Sherman was more
abstract than that. Her green chiffon and long hair unfolded but we
received no message.
   In the earlier program, Thea Nerissa Barnes danced excerpts from
her own ``Portrait.'' This was inspired by her grandmother. A
rather well-known solo, ``Cry,'' dedicated ``to all our mothers
everywhere,'' performed at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater,
is similar and more telling, which detracted a bit from the impact
of ``Portrait.''
   Camille Brown and Young-Ha Yoo danced Lyndon Branaugh's
``Dissonant Conversation.'' It's interesting but looks the most
closely patterned on Graham movement style, as backs arch and necks
bend and hold, like sculpture. The woman pushes the man a couple of
times. She approaches him from the side, as his arm is extended so
that his arm is around her. At the end, they've traded the still
positions in which they began.
   Each program ended with an important Graham work, ``Cortege of
Eagles'' from 1967 and ``The Rite of Spring'' from 1984.

   Thousands of people braved wilting heat Sunday
to see Ferdinand Marcos laid ``temporarily to rest'' in a service
that was part religious ceremony and part political rally.
   Enrique Fernando, the last Philippine Supreme Court Chief
Justice during Marcos' rule, collapsed during an emotional speech
by the ousted Philippine president's son, Ferdinand Jr. or ``Bong
Bong.''
   Dr. Azucena Ignacio, Marcos' personal physician, rushed from the
raised platform holding Marcos' coffin and attended to Fernando
before an ambulance whisked him to St. Francis Medical Center. He
was listed in stable condition.
   Marcos died at the same hospital Sept. 28 at age 72 after a long
illness.
   Initial ambulance reports said the 74-year-old Fernando, who
reportedly has a slight heart ailment, had succumbed to the heat,
exacerbated by the crush of people. The temperature at the cemetery
was about 83 degrees with 72 percent humidity, the National Weather
Service said.
   More than 2,500 people waited hours for Marcos' widow, Imelda,
to arrive at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park with her
husband's body.
   The funeral procession began shortly after 11:15 a.m. when more
than a dozen men rolled Marcos' casket up a long, winding hillside
drive, with hundreds of mourners walking behind.
   They were preceded by supporters carrying the presidential seal
of the Philippines and U.S. and Philippine flags.
   When the pallbearers reached the stairs leading to the small
air-conditioned mausoleum, which had the initials FM landscaped
into shrubs below, elderly retired Philippine generals were
replaced by younger men.
   Once up the stairs, the closed coffin, covered with a Philippine
flag, was surrounded by white flowers on a porch overlooking the
mourners below.
   Mrs. Marcos, dressed all in black, was joined on the platform by
her son, daughter, Irene Araneta, and adopted daughter, Aimee
Marcos.
   There were prayers and a blessing by Monsignor Domingo Nebres,
the Philippine priest who drew the wrath of the Honolulu Catholic
Diocese for comparing Marcos to Jesus Christ during a funeral Mass
Friday.
   Ms. Araneta sang her father's favorite long song and Mrs. Marcos
sang ``Ave Maria'' and the Lord's Prayer.
   Eleven-year-old Aimee Marcos read a saying ``Daddy, I will
always love you forever. Thank you for your legacy of love.''
   The service took a more political turn after pop star Imelda
Papin, Mrs. Marcos' partner in a recent commercial recording duet,
sang a rousing rendition of the Philippine national anthem, with
many in the crowd singing along.
   Bong-Bong Marcos, widely reported to have political aspirations
himself, stirred the crowd with a eulogy to his father, whom he
called ``a man of unbridled excellence.''
   Mrs. Marcos has vowed to eventually bury her husband in the
Philippines and said entombing him above ground in the mausoleum
would make it easier to return his remains to his homeland.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino, who replaced Marcos after a
1986 popular revolt ended his 20-year dictatorial rule and sent him
into exile here, has prohibited Marcos' return even in death.
   The Marcoses were subsequently indicted on U.S. criminal
racketeering charges accusing of them of looting their homeland's
treasury.

   ``Presleynost'' reached U.S. shores Sunday
when a Soviet Elvis fan stepped off an airplane in blue suede
shoes, clutching an exit visa issued solely for a visit to
Graceland, the home of his hero.
   Kolya Vasin, 44, an artist, sculptor and rock impresario from
Leningrad, arrived in Memphis Sunday night. He was greeted by about
100 people, mostly members of area Elvis fan clubs.
   ``I an admirer of Elvis from Russia. I am ambassador of Russian
rock 'n' roll. I love rock 'n' roll many, many years,'' he said.
``I am happy to be here today.''
   Vasin said he's been an Elvis fan since hearing a bootleg copy
of ``Jailhouse Rock.'' Visiting Graceland will be the culmination
of a 30-year dream, he said during a layover in Boston.
   ``I listen to `Jailhouse Rock' for the first time in 1958. After
this shocking moment, I love Elvis forever,'' said the long-haired,
bearded Vasin, who wore bluejeans, a black Elvis T-shirt, a yellow
scarf and a black jacket.
   Earlier Sunday, Vasin arrived at Logan International Airport in
Boston with 79 Elvis fans from Great Britain. He spent a week in
London after leaving Oct. 7. on his first trip outside the Soviet
Union.
   Vasin said his obsession with Elvis is simple.
   ``Because his voice, his spirit is God to me,'' he said. ``All
the good feelings of the human race come out of Elvis.''
   He pointed to his shoes and said: ``I got the shoes in London.
This is my dream on my feet. All my life I hear `Blue Suede Shoes'
and I dream about them.''
   Vasin's visit, called ``Presleynost'' in honor of ``glasnost,''
or the policy of openness promulgated by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, is being sponsored by Elvisly Yours, a London-based
Elvis fan club with a mailing list of 60,000, said club president
Sid Shaw. Elvis fans raised the $3,500 for Vasin's trip, he said.
   Every year, Elvisly Yours pays for several handicapped children
to accompany the group on a trip to Graceland. Shaw, who has been
to Graceland 36 times, said he decided to find a Soviet fan to
sponsor.
   In his quest, he found an expert on rock 'n' roll music in the
Soviet Union at the BBC who told him that Vasin was the biggest
Elvis fan in the country.
   ``He's the Colonel Parker of the Soviet Union,'' proclaimed
Shaw. ``He's a living legend in the Soviet Union.'' Parker was
Presley's longtime manager.
   Vasin said he had tried to get an exit visa for a year with no
luck. But when he was approached by Elvisly Yours, his luck
changed. The club arrranged for an American Elvis club, Suspicious
Minds, to extend an invitation to Vasin through Soviet authorities.
As a result, he was finally granted a visa.
   During his 10-day visit in the United States, Vasin plans to
visit Sun Records, Elvis' first recording label in Memphis, and
Elvis' birthplace in Tupelo, Miss.
   Vasin said he arranges about five rock concerts a year in the
Soviet Union. He said he paints, writes poetry and sculpts, but his
major interest is rock _ and Elvis.
   ``All I want is to love rock and roll,'' said Vasin, who carried
with him a charcoal drawing he did of Elvis. ``I sit in my very
small room and listen to rock 'n' roll with my friends and drink
vodka.''
   About his musical tastes, he said, ``Number one is Elvis, number
two the Beatles, there is zero for the next numbers and then number
eight is Little Richard and number nine is the Rolling Stones and
number 10 Bob Dylan.''
   Vasin said he bought all his Elvis records on the black market.
The first Elvis record was sold legally this year, he said.
   During his stopover in Boston, Vasin broke into a lusty
rendition of Chuck Berry's ``Memphis,'' singing, `Long distance
information, get me Memphis, Tennessee.''

   Japanese investors Monday were visibly calmer about
the stock market than they were after Black Monday two years ago.
   A retail brokerage office of the giant Nomura Securities Co. in
the central Ginza district was somewhat busier than a usual Monday
morning, but the market players seemed to be waiting for bargains
rather than unloading their shares in a panic.
   ``I expect the Nikkei index to remain bearish all day, but I am
not so worried because we all know it is due to external factors,''
said an investor watching the key index shortly after the market
opening.
   ``I am going to sit and wait for a while and start buying shares
later on as shares start hitting the bottom,'' he said.
   In October 1987, after a plunge on Wall Street that went down in
history as Black Monday, brokerages in Tokyo were packed with
massive sell orders that led to the Black Tuesday here.
   The Nikkei average fell 3,836 points, or about 15 percent, on
Oct. 20, 1987, following a 23 percent plunge on Wall Street,
largely due to panic selling by private investors.
   ``Japanese private investors seemed to have learned the lesson
that fluctuation of the Wall Street index is only one of many
aspects of the Tokyo market,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities
Co., speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is undoubtedly an
important elmement, but not necessarily as dominant as it was
thought to be.''
   Keiishi Nishida, a dealer at the Tokyo office of Kidder Peabody
Securities Co., said: ``This is nothing like the crash two years
ago when private investors rushed to the brokers from early in the
morning and sold all they had. I don't think any investors expect
Tokyo shares to drop like New York this time.''
   But he added that investors remained hesitant to place buy
orders because ``they want to make sure that the New York plunge
was only a one-time thing, and the Dow Jones will not go down
further Monday there.''
   Nishida also attributed Tokyo's moderate recovery in late
morning to programmed trading.
   ``After the sizable drop, buy orders from institutional
investors on program-trading came in,'' he said. ``But other than
that, I don't expect much of buy orders today.''
   Another investor in the Ginza office commented: ``In a trading
day like today, you must deal with caution.''

   Bankers at their annual convention said Sunday
the Friday the 13th stock plunge may be a blessing in disguise if
it instills a new sense of caution about highly leveraged corporate
buyouts.
   ``I don't think it's going to be any disaster. It's just going
to cause people to become more cautious as they should have been
from the beginning,'' said Donald T. Senterfitt, vice chairman of
Sun Trust Bank Inc. in Orlando, Fla.
   It was a snag in bank financing for an employee buyout of United
Airlines that triggered the stock market drop. Worry among traders
that banks had become more wary of buyouts caused stocks of
companies targeted for takeover to tumble and the weakness spread
generally through the market.
   In the last 90 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average plummeted 190 points in the worst drop since the October
1987 crash.
   But Senterfitt and other bankers attending cocktail receptions
and seminars at the American Bankers Association, the industry's
largest trade group, were making no apologies Sunday.
   ``What we were seeing was a house of cards, bound to come
tumbling down. I hope the United Airlines thing marks a more
conservative approach by banking throughout,'' Senterfitt said.
   In a leveraged buyout, or LBO, investors _ often managers
seeking to thwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily in order to
take over a company or a division of a company.
   The new owners either cut costs or sell off parts of the company
to pay back the loans. The danger is that the restructured
company's debt burden is so heavy it will topple into bankruptcy in
an economic downturn.
   Large banks, as profits in their traditional business of
commercial lending grew scarce, have turned increasingly to
leveraged buyout financing as a source of lucrative fees.
   In fact, according to analysts, some large banks are as heavily
involved in LBO lending as they are in Third World debt. If all of
the LBO lending went sour at once, a number of large banks would be
insolvent.
   As of June 30, according to Robert Litan of the Brookings
Institution, five large banks had made leveraged loans exceeding
their equity: Bank of Boston, 103 percent; Bank of New York, 127
percent; Continental Bank, 123 percent; Manufacturers Hanover, 107
percent, and Wells Fargo, 119 percent.
   ``Aggregate LBO exposures, including related equity investments,
exceed equity for most money-center banks,'' analyst James J.
McDermott Jr. of Keefe Bruyette and Woods warned the Senate Banking
Committee earlier this month.
   Regulators have noted the trend. Both the Federal Reserve, which
oversees bank holding companies, and the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department which regulates
nationally-chartered banks, formally warned banks last fall to
exercise caution in LBOs and ordered government examiners to
closely scrutinize such lending.
   That's starting to have an effect, according to Thomas P.
Rideout, outgoing ABA president and vice chairman of First Union
National Bank, Charlotte, N.C.
   ``It appears to me that regulators have a very good handle on
the bank exposure to LBOs. ... That kind of publicity would make a
credit committee more cautious,'' he said.
   Rideout said it's only natural that banks, with signs of a
softening economy emerging, would apply tougher lending standards.
   ``When you've had an expansion as long as this one, you always
think as a banker or businessman, `When am I going to have to
tighten my belt and hunker down a bit,'' he said. ``This would be
the wrong time to invest in an airline, or any other industry, if
you think you have doubts about their bottom line.''
   Robert Dugger, the banking association's chief economist, said
to a degree it is the buyout deals themselves that have changed,
not bankers' attitudes.
   ``What you saw in the events of last week was a transaction that
just didn't meet the flinch test. It required more faith in the
future than bankers are accustomed to affording,'' he said.
   ``It doesn't mean bankers have become more conservative. It
reflects the fact that the leveraging in these deals has had to get
progressively deeper in order to remain profitable,'' Dugger said.
   Banking analyst Alex Sheshunoff of Austin, Texas, who was
attending the convention, said, ``I think (the stock drop) is a
healthy end to a phenomena that longer term could be detrimental to
both the companies involved, the economy and the country. ...
   ``I think it's important that the LBO thing is slowing down now

<HEAD>Mexican Glass Giant Buys Anchor, Latchford Glass Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge Mexican glass company Vitro SA
announced Sunday it had signed a definitive agreement to buy Anchor
Class Container Corp. and Latchford Glass Co. of California for
more than $900 million.
   The Anchor deal, valued at about $800 million, would be the
largest Mexican takeover of a U.S. company, Vitro said.
   Vitro's protracted effort to take over Tampa-based Anchor, the
nation's second-largest glass company, won approval by Anchor's
directors after the glass giant raised its cash tender offer for
Anchor stock from $20 to $21.25 a share. Anchor's board of
directors in August rejected the $20-a-share bid.
   ``The acquisition of Anchor, which has nearly $1 billion in
sales, is a unique strategic opportunity for Vitro SA to become a
world player in the glass container industry,'' said Ernesto
Martens, Vitro's chief executive officer.
   The tender offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire
at midnight EST Oct. 27, Vitro said in a statement Sunday. Vitro
already owns about 10.3 percent of Anchor's shares.
   Vitro earlier announced a friendly merger agreement with
Latchford, a small, privately owned glass maker based in Huntington
Park, Calif. The Latchford deal was contingent upon the completion
of the takeover of Anchor, Vitro said.
   Vitro, based in Monterrey, is one of Mexico's largest publicly
held companies, with more than 37,000 employees and a profit of
$150 million in 1988 on revenues of almost $1.1 billion.
   Vitro manufactures glass and plastic containers, flat glass,
major appliances, tableware and glassmaking machinery, and operates
joint ventures with such U.S. corporations as Ford Motor Co.,
Whirlpool Corp., Ingersoll-Rand Co., Owens-Corning Fiberglass
Corp., and Samsonite Corp.
   Anchor Glass made $978 million last year manufacturing glass
containers for food, beverage, and cosmetics industries in 20
factories across the country. Latchford, which has two plants, has
been making glass containers for food and beverage industries since
1917.
   Vitro promised Sunday to keep Anchor's corporate headquarters in
Tampa, and to run the company with U.S. managers as a fully
independent U.S. subsidiary.
   ``We are confident that the combination of our companies will
result in enhanced business and financial prospects for Anchor's
employees, customers and communities,'' Martens said.
   Anchor's chairman and chief executive officer, Vincent Naimoli,
also predicted a ``sound and exciting future for the employees of
Anchor Glass.''
   Vitro has said it plans to modernize Anchor's plants so that its
products are more competitive with the plastic and aluminum
containers that have taken an increasing share of the U.S. market
for food containers.
   Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
Securities Corp. are managing the tender offer for a Vitro
subsidiary, THR Corp., and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. is advising
Anchor.
   Security Pacific National Bank has committed to provide $139
million of financing for the Anchor tender offer. An affiliate of
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette has promised to provide a $155
million short-term loan for the separate buyout of Latchford, which
was expected to close at the same time as the Anchor offer.

<HEAD>Engineers Talks Begin Monday; Copter Plant Workers OK Pact Extension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Union workers at Boeing Co.'s helicopter division
on Sunday approved an indefinite contract extension at their
Pennsylvania plant, avoiding a strike that has hit Boeing plants
elsewhere.
   No negotiations were scheduled in the nearly 2-week-old strike
by machinists, but contract talks were set to begin Monday between
Boeing and its second-largest union, representing engineers and
technical workers.
   Members of United Aerospace Workers Local 1069, which represents
about 3,200 hourly production and maintenance workers at Boeing
Helicopters' suburban Philadelphia plant, met Sunday after a 10-day
contract extension expired at midnight.
   Company spokesman Robert Torgerson said the workers agreed to
another extension, with a 10-day notification requirement to cancel
for either side.
   ``We're just continuing to talk,'' Torgerson said. ``The major
issues are wages and benefits.''
   Neither Local 1069 president Anthony Forte nor Art Andrews,
chairman of the Local 1069 strike committee, were available Sunday
to comment, according to a person answering the union's telephone.
   Neither side has released details in the contract dispute.
   The contract at the helicopter plant expired Oct. 4, but both
sides agreed to hold off any strike or lockout for at least 10
days, with the contract remaining in effect through the period.
   Boeing Helicopter has a total of about 6,500 employees. The
plant's operations have not been affected by the Machinists union
strike elsewhere at Boeing because the hourly workers are
represented by a different union.
   Boeing Helicopter builds Army CH-47D Chinook helicopters and is
a partner with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. to develop the V-22
Osprey tilt-rotor plane for the Defense Department. It also
produces components for Boeing commercial jet transports.
   The Machinists union's 57,800 members at Boeing walked out Oct.
4 after overwhelmingly rejecting a new contract offer from the
world's largest commercial jet builder. About 43,300 strikers are
in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland,
Ore., and lesser numbers at a half-dozen other locations.
   Dan Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, said negotiators for that union
and Boeing probably would meet Monday and Tuesday, then hold
sporadic sessions as needed over the next three weeks.
   Their contract expires Dec. 1, but no one expects a strike by
the unaffiliated group, which represents nearly 28,000 engineers,
scientists, manual writers, draftsmen and other technical workers.

<HEAD>Weekend Redemptions Running `Light' At Nation's Biggest Stock Fund</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT week's decline to 216 points sted 226</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's largest stock mutual
fund said redemption requests have been running ``very light''
since Friday's market scare partly because investors are in for the
long haul and aren't necessarily spooked by even a large decline.
   Following last week's 216-point decline in the Dow Jones
industrial average, most of which hit during the last hour of
trading Friday, some market observers voiced fears that mutual
funds would be hit with massive redemptions by clients wanting to
get out of the market.
   That could force fund managers to dump stocks in order to raise
enough cash to pay their clients, thereby exacerbating the market
turmoil.
   But money market guru Peter Lynch, who heads Fidelity
Investments' $12.5 billion Magellan fund, said Sunday that ``the
real fast, aggressive people left before the close on Friday. This
weekend (redemptions have) been very light.''
   Lynch admits that over the past six weeks he has increased
Magellan's cash position by $350 million to $850 million, but it
was not because he feared his fund's shareholders would start
cashing out. Rather, he said in a telephone interview from his
Boston home, ``I haven't been finding that many stocks that are
undervalued.''
   Investors generally view stock funds as long-term investments
and aren't likely to ``rush out and redeem that quickly,'' said
Erick Kanter, vice president of the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association of mutual funds.
   Stock funds account for roughly 25 percent of total mutual fund
assets of $242 billion. Most stock funds keep about 10 percent of
their total assets in cash.
   A Gallup survey of 150 Fidelity customers late Friday and early
Saturday found that 84 percent said they had invested for the long
term while 4 percent said they intended to sell their fund shares
in the next few weeks.
   Kanter said that even following Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987,
when the Dow plummeted 508 points, only 2 percent of total stock
fund assets actually were redeemed.
   Those who did redeem ``wound up losing a lot because stock funds
rebounded very quickly,'' Kanter said. Even Magellan posted a gain
at the close of 1987, although it was a 1 percent increase rather
than the 41 percent gain that the fund had been tracking before
Black Monday.
   Still, Lynch said Magellan has had ``redemptions up until
August. ... The public has been very nervous since '87 and has been
cutting back pretty steadily.''
   Lynch said he believed the overall stock market likely would
have a net gain for the full year, making 1989 the record-setting
eighth consecutive advancing year.
   ``The reason we've had eight straight years is because we had 16
years of nothing,'' he said. ``The market went sideways or down for
16 years.''
   The previous longest advance began in 1896 and lasted for six
years, Lynch said.

<TEXT>
   Israel's stock exchange, one of the few foreign
markets to trade on the weekend after the Wall Street plunge,
witnessed frantic trading and a 6.9 percent drop in share value
Sunday, officials said.
   Although the Tel Aviv market is small and limited to local
stocks, analysts looked to the exchange for signs of how other
world markets would react. Among a handful of small foreign markets
to trade over the weekend, Taiwan lost ground but South Korea
posted a small gain.
   ``What is happening here is a reaction to the news coming from
New York on Friday,'' said Yossi Nitzani, director of the stock
exchange. ``There are large amounts of selling in almost all areas
of the market.
   ``The feeling here is that something very significant happened
in New York,'' Nitzani said. ``Capital markets don't like
uncertainty, so the first reaction was to get out and wait for
things to become clearer.''
   Trading was three times its usual volume, with stocks declining
in paper value by $400 million, Nitzani said in an interview. It
was the sharpest fall since October 1987, when Israeli share values
were off 8.5 percent in reaction to the New York crash.
   Sunday's fall in the dollar-linked bond market was less
dramatic, down 2 percent.
   No U.S. stocks are traded in Israel and no Israeli stocks are
sold on Wall Street, but the U.S. market has strong influence in
Israel because the two economies are closely intertwined.
   The Tel Aviv exchange is open from Sunday to Thursday and closed
Friday and Saturday for the Jewish sabbath.
   Simcha Sadan, an economist at Tel Aviv University, said on
Israel Television there could be a spillover into Israel because of
extensive economic ties between Israel and the United States, its
major ally and source of nearly $3 billion in annual aid.
   ``If the American economy gets sick, then we will certainly get
pneumonia,'' he said.
   The director of one of Tel Aviv's largest trading houses
predicted further drops after London and Tokyo openend.
   ``I am afraid it is not finished,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``London will probably fall when it opens
Monday and that will influence people here as well as in New York.''

   Vending machines have come a long way from
bubble-gum machines and coffee, soda and candy dispensers. Now a
machine will sell you hot, personal-size pizzas, or a fresh cup of
cappuccino or espresso coffee.
   These and other innovations _ along with coinless ``debit card''
machines _ were introduced over the weekend at the annual
convention of the National Automatic Merchandising Association.
   The trade show drew thousands of representatives of the $20.9
billion vending machine industry, association spokesman David Stone
said Sunday.
   The upscale coffee machines, manufactured by the Italian
corporation Borghi SpA, crush a small amount of coffee beans for
each cup, blast steam through the grounds, and dispense a strong,
tasty brew in a tiny cup.
   ``We're looking for the upscale, higher-end consumers who
appreciate a better, European cup of coffee and ethnic groups who
don't like American coffee because they find it too diluted,'' said
Erick Feitshans, director of U.S. operations for Borghi.
   ``We use a filter ... that de-chlorinates and purifies the
water,'' said Feitshans, who noted there is an industry trend
toward using filtered water ``so we don't use dirt water out of
city plumbing systems.''
   The machines also make hot chocolate and regular, American-style
coffee for consumers with more conventional tastes.
   Coffee costs from 80 cents to $1.20, with cappuccino the
costliest.
   Pennsylvania businessman G.W. Black and his son, Brett, offered
a 7-inch cheese and pepperoni pizza that takes 60 seconds to make
in their Pizza Chef, a microwave-pizza oven. They hope the $2 tab
for a pie will be within the budget of college students looking for
a late-night snack.
   ``It's a little bigger than a pan pizza at Pizza Hut and it's a
buck cheaper,'' Black said. ``It's not doughy and it's not super
crispy. I think we did a good job ... for a microwave pizza.''
   Bert de Vos, owner of De Vos International, a vending machine
company in the Netherlands, displayed his ``Deepfrozen'' machine
that sells a consumer a frozen dinner and has a built-in microwave
oven to heat it up.
   To make it easier for customers to pay for these items, vendors
are moving toward introducing debit card systems, especially on
college campuses, Stone said.
   Customers can feed bills, such as $10, into a machine which
produces a magnetic-strip credit card. When the card is inserted
into a vending machine to buy an item like a 50-cent candy bar, the
purchase price is automatically deducted, leaving $9.50 on the card.
   Students at the University of Kentucky are already using the
debit cards for the campus cafeteria, vending machines and even
washing machines, said Bruce Vernon, customer service manager for
Debitek, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., which makes one of the debit
card models.
   ``And it's much easier for the vending industry,'' he said. ``It
takes all the coin mechanisms out of the machine,'' which cuts the
maintenance costs for collecting money and unjamming slots.
   ``It (the technology) is here already ... but it looks like this
is the year it's going to take off,'' Vernon said.

   Japanese investment in American real estate and
businesses does not threaten the national security or economic
health of the United States, experts told a conference in Tokyo
last week.
   But strong public resentment over highly publicized Japanese
purchases of American companies, like Sony Corp.'s recent $3.4
billion takeover of Columbia Pictures, indicates Japan should do
more to reassure Americans of its good intentions, they said.
   ``Foreign investment is good for both economies ... as President
John F. Kennedy once said, `a rising tide lifts all the boats,'''
said Elliot Richardson, a former U.S. secretary of both commerce
and defense.
   Aside from helping cover the U.S. trade and federal budget
deficits, Japanese investment can aid technology transfers and help
revitalize U.S. industries through the sharing by Japanese
companies of management and production techniques with American
partners, speakers at the conference said.
   They acknowledged, however, that the perception of Japanese
investment among many Americans was strongly negative and could get
worse.
   ``Americans grew up in an era when the U.S. was the source, not
the recipient, of foreign investment. They feel we are losing
control of our economic destiny,'' said Richardson, who heads the
Washington-based Association for International Investment, a
conference sponsor.
   The American sponsors and their Japanese counterpart, the
Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, said they held the
conference to help the Japanese understand why their investments in
America can be controversial even while the U.S. government
welcomes them.
   In a recent Gallup poll reported in Newsweek magazine, 52
percent of the people polled said they viewed Japanese economic
might as a greater threat than Soviet military power.
   Japanese investment in the United States has come under fire
largely because of its rapid growth _ twice as fast as that of
other nations _ in highly visible areas, U.S. Ambassador to Japan
Michael Armacost told the conference.
   Japan's total investment in American real estate, corporations
and subsidiaries skyrocketed from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $53.4
billion in 1988.
   Of a total $65 billion in foreign direct investment in 1988,
Japan accounted for $14.2 billion, just behind Britain's $21.5
billion. Economists estimate Japanese investment will reach $21
billion this year.
   Highly publicized lawsuits against Japanese firms accusing them
of racial and sexual discrimination along with problems in
balancing American and Japanese management styles and staff in U.S.
offices have contributed to the backlash against Japanese
investment, speakers said.
   Alice Young, a partner in the New York-based law firm Milbank,
Tweed, Hadley and McCloy, urged Japanese investors to keep a low
profile in making investments _ to ``avoid plastering `Japan Inc.'
all over everything'' _ to seek expert advice to avoid lawsuits
over largely avoidable problems, and to hire and promote the best
American talent to positions of responsibility.
   Armacost noted that 85 percent of all chief executive officers
in Japanese overseas subsidiaries are Japanese, while only 20
percent of the CEO positions in overseas subsidiaries in Japan are
filled by expatriates.
   ``Until companies are perceived as creating the best environment
for American workers, you won't get the best,'' Ms. Young said.
   Japanese investors can also allay American anxiety over their
economic activities by getting more deeply involved in community
activities in the United States, speakers said.
   ``A Japanese corporation in America needs to be more responsible
to community concerns than it would be at home,'' said Richardson,
singling out the Hitachi Foundation's program of matching grants to
community projects.
   While there is substantial room for improvement in the way
Japanese firms operate in the United States, there is no evidence
to support charges that Japan is ``buying America on the cheap,''
said Jonathon E. Colby, a partner in Blackstone Financial Services
Inc.
   ``Japanese companies buy only high-quality assets at a fair
price,'' Colby said.
   Japanese companies operating subsidiaries in the United States
are reinvesting their profits from American operations rather than
sending them home, said Samuel M. Rosenblatt, president of the
Association for International Investment.
   The rate of return from U.S. affiliates from 1981 to 1988 was
only 3.3 percent for Japanese-owned firms, compared with 5.6
percent for all foreign-owned firms in the United States,
indicating that Japanese are investing in America for the long
term, he said.
   Officials of the Departments of Commerce and Defense said there
were no signs that Japanese investment was threatening U.S.
national security.
   Robert L. Mullen, deputy undersecretary of defense, said that in
cases in which a joint venture would involve the sole U.S. company
with a strategic product or technology, the Defense Department
makes arrangements to ensure the deal will not compromise national
security.
