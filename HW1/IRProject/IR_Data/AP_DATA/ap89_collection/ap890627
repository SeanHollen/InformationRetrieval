   President Bush is weighing changes in campaign
finance law to limit the multimillion-dollar influence of
special-interest political action committees, officials said Tuesday.
   Bush indicated in a news conference that he has not made his
final decisions on what he will propose Thursday in the way of
revamping the federal campaign finance laws.
   But officials said he is considering a version of his previously
announced wish for a ban on political action committee
contributions, which in the 1988 election amounted to $151.3 million
for congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election
Commission records.
   One administration official, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said other proposals Bush is reviewing include:
   _Barring members of Congress from carrying over campaign fund
surpluses from one election to the next. Members who win their races
handily sometimes amass huge warchests by rolling over the funds
from one year to the next.
   _Setting up a system in which executive branch agencies would
have to log calls they received from members of Congress trying to
sway them on a policy.
   _Limiting the amount congressional incumbents could spend on
mailings with their ``franking'' privileges. Critics say these
mailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage over
election challengers at the expense of the taxpayers.
   Bush has made at least one decision, according to unidentified
officials quoted in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post: to
seek legislation outlawing `gerrymandering,'' the drawing of
congressional districts to favor one party.
   Bush would request a new requirement _ that districts be compact,
contiguous and respecting community boundaries in addition to
current court-enforced requirements that a state's districts
contains equal numbers of people as nearly as possible.
   Instead of ruling out all PACs, the options he is now considering
would ban corporate or labor union PACs, according to the official.
The options would allow those that are not connected to such groups,
so-called ideological PACs that are centered on a political
philosophy or agenda.
   The president also is looking at the possibility of lowering the
current $5,000 per candidate limit for PAC contributions to $1,000.
   In the category of banned PACs, if Bush agrees to this option,
would be so-called leadership PACs, those headed by politicians and
used to dispense campaign funds to other candidates. They also are
used as a springboard for presidential candidates, including Bush,
who headed the one of the nation's two most successful PACs in the
years before his presidential bid.
   Bush told reporters that one proposal he will not adopt is a
system of public financing for congressional campaigns, as is now
the system for the presidential elections.
   ``I oppose public financing of these campaigns. I think people
should be able to attract private support, and I think participation
by individuals in a the political process through financial support
is very, very important,'' Bush said.
   Current law allows individuals to contribute a maximum of $1,000
per candidate in each election, while PACs may give $5,000.
   Some groups and members of Congress advocate setting up a federal
fund to pay for congressional races after the model now used for the
presidential elections and supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff on
individual income tax forms.
   Besides speaking against that idea, Bush said he would not reveal
any specifics of his thinking on campaign finance reform before
Thursday, when he speaks to a group of congressional interns at the
Library of Congress.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the intention of the
president's plan will be ``to strengthn the parties, increase
competition and fairness in elections and to curtail special
interest'' in campaigns.
   ``I will have specific proposals,'' he said, adding they would be
``fairly far reaching because I want to see reform _ real reform.''
   If he calls on Congress to outlaw leadership PACs, he will be
speaking against an increasingly influential funding mechanism that
many presidential contenders use in their pre-announcement phase to
finance their travels around the country to whip up support.
   Officially, such PACs are set up to help like-minded candidates
for congressional or other offices and are not allowed to fund
presidential campaign activity. But there is little doubt that they
serve immense benefit for politicians who are preparing a White
House bid.
   Bush's PAC, called Fund For America's Future, was the second
largest of some 4,000 PACs that file records with the Federal
Election Comission.
   The Bush PAC raised $9.4 million in the years when it was most
active, the 1985-86 campaign cycle, second only to the conservative
Congressional Club founded by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. The
Congressional Club and its affiliated groups raised $16.6 million.
   The corporate PACs were led by AT&amp;T's which raised $1.8 million,
Federal Election Commission records show.
   Of labor-related PACs, the Teamsters had the largest, raising
$4.4 million that cycle. Among the trade association-related PACs,
the Realtors' PAC raised $5.7 million and the American Medical
Association PAC, just under $5 million.
   In the 1987-88 election cycle, Bush's PAC raised just under $2
million as his presidential campaign geared up and fund-raising
efforts were diverted to it.
   In the primary season, Bush's campaign received $862,950 in
contributions from special-interest PACs.

<HEAD>Treasure Hunters Hope Sunken Ship Will Be 17th Century Galleon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-preserved ship believed to be a 17th
century Spanish galleon loaded with gold has been found in 1,500
feet of water near the Florida Keys, according to a salvage company.
   Much of the wooden vessel and its cargo appears to be intact
because of the pressure and temperature of the water.
   ``It's worth a fortune in history.'' Greg Stemm, a Tampa
businessman who hopes to recover the riches, told The St. Petersburg
Times for an article published Wednesday.
   Stemm believes the wreck is the Nuestra Senora de la Merced, a
Spanish Colonial galleon believed to have vanished during the same
hurricane 350 years ago that felled another galleon, the Nuestra
Senora de Atocha.
   The Atocha, laden with gold and silver, was found by treasure
hunter Mel Fisher in 1985, about 50 miles north of Stemm's discovery.
   If Stemm's research proves correct, the wreck he discovered could
hold a treasure worth millions. Stemm, 32, is co-owner of a deep-sea
research company that discovered the sunken vessel in April.
   Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology of Tampa plans to disclose the
details of its remote-camera exploration of the ship on Wednesday.
Archaeologist and treasure hunters are hoping photos prove it's the
Merced, sunk in 1622.
   ``This is just like a time capsule because nothing's been
touched,'' said Dan S. Bagley, a Seahawk director.
   By the end of the summer, the salvors aboard Stemm's 85-foot
research vessel Seahawk will begin a full-scale operation to
retrieve the fragile artifacts and confirm the ship's identity.
   So far, they have discovered a ship's bell and a number of olive
jars that could be filled with wine, food and other commodities. The
project could take up to two years.
   Jim Miller, a state archaeologist, said he has talked to the
salvors about the importance of preserving the artifacts and other
salvageable items from the wreck.
   ``Regardless of what vessel it is, archaeologically, it's an
extremely significant site,'' Miller said. ``If you consider the
historic value, it's very great. The other side of that question is
the monetary value.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned the
conviction of former Reagan administration aide Lyn Nofziger for
illegally lobbying his White House colleagues months after he left
the government.
   In a 2-1 ruling, the panel said Nofziger's 1988 conviction must
``be set aside because it is not based on a finding that he had
knowledge of each element of the offenses'' he was accused of
committing.
   ``The government was required to prove that he had knowledge of
all of the facts making his conduct criminal,'' said the decision
written by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge James Buckley.
Buckley was joined by judge Stephen Williams. Both are Reagan
appointees.
   Appeals court judge Harry Edwards, a Carter administration
appointee, dissented, saying there was ``no basis for overturning
Nofziger's conviction.''
   Asked at a news conference whether he thought he had gotten off
on a legal technicality, Nofziger said, ``Absolutely no. ... I think
they came after me on a technicality.''
   James McKay, the independent counsel who prosecuted Nofziger,
issued a statement saying he ``will consider his options to pursue
further appellate review of this decision.'' The prosecutor could
seek a review by the entire federal appeals court in Washington or
appeal to the Supreme Court.
   President Bush and other high level administration officials were
clearly pleased.
   Bush, asked at a state dinner honoring Australian Prime Minister
Robert Hawke what he thought of the ruling, smiled broadly and said
only, ``I'm always glad when soembody is found not guilty of
something.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was more effusive, calling
the decision ``terrific.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle said it was good news and Bush's chief
of staff, John Sununu said he had called Nofziger to congratulate
him and let him know `` at least some of his old friends hadn't
forgotten him.''
   The case against Nofziger, President Reagan's White House
political director in 1981, was the first major test of the
revolving-door provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. The law
imposes a one-year ban on lobbying former government colleagues once
an upper-echelon employee leaves service in the executive branch.
   Nofziger said he was ``certainly pleased'' by the decision. ``I
think I was innocent from the beginning; I still think I am
innocent,'' he said.
   He was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, of three counts of illegally
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients after
he left the White House one year into the Reagan administration. The
clients were scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineers
union and the manufacturer of the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.
   Nofziger, who is 65, was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined
$30,000. He said that defending himself cost ``a bundle, a bundle,''
with legal fees running over $1.5 million and ``I suppose, more than
that'' in lost income.
   As a lobbyist accused of felonies, ``you not only lose clients,
you don't get clients.'' But he acknowledged he has been able to
keep his business going while the case made its way through the
courts.
   Asked about the ``revolving door'' provisions of the ethics law
under which he was prosecuted, Nofziger said, ``I don't think I am
part of any revolving door syndrome.''
   ``People lobby in this town; the main industry in this town
besides government is lobbying,'' he said.
   The ethics law prohibits executive branch officials from
``knowingly'' acting as agents or attorneys before their old
agencies within one year after leaving the government.
   Nofziger contended the word ``knowingly'' also applied to a
prohibition against making ``oral or written communications'' to
their previous government colleagues on matters in which the agency
had ``a direct and substantial interest'' within one year.
Prosecutors said the word ``knowingly'' referred only to acting as
an agent or attorney.
   ``This is not an idle grammatical inquiry,'' said Buckley's
ruling. ``If Nofziger's interpretation is correct, no one may be
convicted ... unless it is proven that he had knowledge of each of
the facts constituting the offense.''
   The court found that the wording was ambiguous.
   ``Canons of statutory construction require that an ambiguous
criminal statute be interpreted in the defendant's favor,'' said
Buckley.
   The prosecutors never alleged that Nofziger knew his former
colleagues had a direct and substantial interest in the matters on
which he was lobbying them.
   Under the prosecution's theory, ``if an ex-official tries to
interest his former agency in a particular project in the mistaken
belief that it had no `direct and substantial interest' in it, he
will have committed a felony punishable by up to two years in
jail,'' said Buckley.
   In his dissent, Edwards said the law was clear and that the word
``knowingly'' didn't apply to the provisions under which Nofziger
was convicted.
   ``The majority has labored mightily to find an ambiguity,'' said
Edwards. But there is no ambiguity to resolve ``and, consequently,
no basis for overturning Nofziger's conviction,'' he said.
   ``I cannot comprehend my colleagues' convoluted attempts to
embrace'' Nofziger's ``fancied ambiguity, and their ... willingness
to ignore clear legislative history and engage in overt
legislating,'' said Edwards.
   Buckley and Williams remanded the case to the District Court
``for proceedings consistent with this opinion.''
   ``The District Court should have dismissed the indictment filed
by the prosecution,'' said the decision.
   A federal court jury found Nofziger guilty of illegally using his
influence by sending an April 8, 1982, memo to then-presidential
counselor Edwin Meese III.
   The memo suggested that Meese enlist the support of President
Reagan and others to persuade the Army to give a no-bid contract to
build small gasoline engines to Wedtech, which in the last years of
the Reagan administration became the focus of a massive federal
corruption probe. While he was attorney general, Meese himself came
under criminal investigation in connection with Wedtech. He wasn't
prosecuted.
   Nofziger also was convicted of sending an Aug. 20, 1982, memo to
James Jenkins, Meese's deputy, urging the administration to put
civilian sailors on Navy vessels. The policy was being pushed by the
Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, which paid Nofziger's
lobbying firm $100,000 a year.
   Additionally, the jury said Nofziger illegally lobbied two
National Security Council officials about continued production of
the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane, which was made by Fairchild
Corp.

   Rene Acuna is starving himself to
protest a life prison sentence, but he's on a well-worn road that
state corrections officials say will end in court-ordered force
feeding.
   ``I am innocent and I don't eat,'' said Acuna, a Cuban immigrant
who speaks broken English.
   Acuna, 37, of Detroit, stopped eating _ except for water and
sugared coffee _ March 3 after he was convicted of conspiracy and
delivery of two pounds of cocaine. His sentence is life without
parole.
   Acuna once carried 180 pounds on his 5-foot, 5-inch frame. As of
Friday, he had lost 64 pounds. His body swims in his prison blues.
His cheeks are sunken.
   ``I see the food like a chair, like a sofa. The hunger? When you
have a reason to support your spirit and your mind, you don't need
anything more,'' he said in a telephone interview from the hospital
at the State Prison of Southern Michigan, near Jackson.
   But a series of court rulings across the nation have upheld the
power of prison officials to force feed inmates on long-term hunger
strikes. Corrections experts say no record is kept of how many
hunger strikes occur each year in American prisons, but they believe
long ones are rare.
   Typically, courts decide that prison authorities' need to control
their institutions outweighs prisoners' rights to privacy and
control of their bodies, said Ed Koren, staff assistant for the
National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Obviously, they have an interest in controlling the institution
and when a prisoner does something like this, he is embarrassing the
heck out of them,'' he said.
   Department of Corrections officials label Acuna's hunger strike a
publicity stunt, and have doctors check him each day.
   The department will go to court to get the authority to force
feed him if his condition worsens, said Leo Lalonde, deputy director
of the Department of Corrections, adding ``that could be today. That
could be tomorrow.''
   Michigan officials seek such authority about 10 times a year in
order to safeguard the health of inmates who refuse food or medical
care, said Chris DeWitt, spokesman for Attorney General Frank Kelley.
   Acuna's lawyers say his determination poses an ethical dilemma.
   ``This is the stuff `L.A. Law' is written about. What do you do
when your client wants to die?'' asked James Neuhard, director of
the Michigan Appellate Defender's office, which will handle the
appeal of Acuna's drug convictions.
   ``I told him if he dies from not eating, even if he is innocent,
his appeal will be stopped right then,'' said Sandra Girard,
director of Prison Legal Services of Michigan Inc.
   In a New Hampshire case, inmate Joseph Calk decided to starve
himself to death rather than serve a 180-year sentence.
   Arpy Saunders, Calk's lawyer, said the New Hampshire Supreme
Court allowed authorities to force-feed Calk to keep him alive so
that he could face another charge pending in California.
   ``It wasn't up to him to determine how long he should serve,''
said Saunders, summarizing the court's ruling.
   Mark David Chapman, sentenced to 20 years to life for the murder
of former Beatle John Lennon, staged a hunger strike to call
attention to starving children.
   But the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court decided
prison security needs outweighed Chapman's claim that the right to
privacy includes a right to refuse to eat.
   One exception to that philosophy came in Georgia, where inmate
Ted Prevatte won a lawsuit to prevent authorities from force-feeding
him, but eventually ended his hunger strike, aimed at winning
transfer to another prison system, said Department of Corrections
spokesman John Siler.
   The Georgia Supreme Court found force-feeding was too great an
invasion of an inmate's right to privacy, saying the state ``has no
right to destroy a person's will by frustrating his attempt to die
if necessary to make a point.''

   One in three Japanese favor moving the capital out

   The poll, conducted by the Prime Minister's office, found 32.6
percent of respondents to favor relocation, with 17 percent opposed.
Another 34.3 percent were undecided and 16.1 percent had no answer.
   Those favoring relocation say it is necessary to correct
overconcentration of the population and solve housing and
transportation problems. Those opposed say businesses should instead
be distributed to places other than Tokyo.
   Nearly 10 percent of Japan's people live in Tokyo.
   The office said it questioned 10,000 people age 20 and older at
random in December.

<HEAD>Former European Parliament Member Fined for Plane Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fear of flying has cost a former British member
of the European Parliament $1,240, the fine imposed by a court
because he refused to fasten his airplane seat belt.
   Richard Cottrell, 45, was arrested at Heathrow Airport on May 24
after arriving from Frankfurt on a Lufthansa flight.
   An airline spokeswoman said at the time that Cottrell had refused
to fasten his seat belt as the flight approached London and
attempted to continue the argument in the cockpit with the captain.
   Cottrell, a Conservative, was fined Monday after pleading guilty
to acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or the people
aboard.
   At the magistrate's court hearing, the defense said Cottrell's
fear of flying was the reason he refused to fasten his seat belt.
   Cottrell went to the cockpit door and told the pilot, ``I am a
member of Parliament,'' after he was told international regulations
required all passengers to wear seat belts, the court was told.
   Prosecutor Neville Casselmann said Cottrell remained at the
cockpit until the pilot shouted: ``Out _ we are landing.''
   He returned to his seat about two minutes before the landing.
   Defense attorney Patrick Darby said his client ``for some
considerable time had a large-scale phobia of flying. It arose out
of an incident 15 years ago when he was a passenger in a light
aircraft forced to make an emergency landing. He was badly shaken up
by it.''
   He added that his client ``always sits near the emergency exits
and never fastens his seat belt.''
   In this month's European Parliament elections, Cottrell lost the
Bristol, western England, seat he had held for 10 years.

   Workers in boats scooped blobs of congealed
oil the size of basketballs and bigger from the Delaware River on
Monday and tried to contain the 800,000-gallon oil spill, the
biggest of three weekend spills.
   Deep-water booms were installed to keep the heavy oil on the
Delaware from moving out to sea.
   Skimmers sent out after a Uruguayan tanker ran aground early
Saturday couldn't handle the dense oil blobs and jammed. Coast Guard
Capt. Larry Murdock said Monday a call was issued for more boats,
and 300 Delaware National Guardsmen were activated to help 250
private contractor employees scoop the goey mess from the water.
   However, federal officials said shoreline damage in Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New Jersey was almost nonexistent. That was because the
oil congealed and did not wash up like lighter oils spilled over the
weekend in Rhode Island and Texas and crude oil spilled earlier this
year along the coast of Alaska.
   Near Newport, R.I., the 420,000 gallons of lighter oil that
spilled from a tanker after it hit a reef had largely dispersed or
evaporated by Monday morning, officials said. Conditions were
``much, much better than yesterday,'' said Stephen G. Morin, a state
environmental official.
   Coast Guard Capt. Eric Williams of the Providence, R.I., marine
safety office said there was no evidence that anything but human
error played a role in the spill.
   He said there was no evidence of mechanical failure and noted
that the ship's captain, Iakovos Georgudis, told Gov. Edward DiPrete
he had made a mistake. DiPrete said over the weekend that Georgudis
told him he erred in plotting the ship's course.
   A harbor pilot on his way to a rendezvous with the tanker tried
to warn the ship it was heading into dangerous waters, but his radio
message came too late, The New York Times reported in Tuesday's
editions.
   The newspaper quoted Capt. Bruce B. Fisher, chairman of the
Northeast Pilots Association of Newport, as saying that the harbor
pilot, Capt. David G. Leonard, gave such an account to National
Transportation Safety Board investigators.
   In Texas, most of the oil spilled Friday in the Houston Ship
Channel by the collision of a tanker and an oil barge was
concentrated in a smaller channel by wind and waves from approaching
Tropical Storm Allison, allowing the use of huge vacuum machines to
pick up the oil. By Monday afternoon, about two-thirds of the 6,000
barrels spilled had been recovered, said Coast Guard spokesman Bob
Morehead.
   In Washington, the president's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,
complained Monday that the oil industry was moving too slowly on
oil-spill cleanup technology and said the latest spills show `the
pervasiveness of the problem.'' He said they also underscored the
need for legislation to better define tanker owners' liabilities.
   Fitzwater ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and
exploration, as some have urged in the wake of the spills.
   Master Chief Petty Officer James Kosch, a Coast Guard spokesman,
said he doubted any investigations into the spills had reached
conclusions. Kosch said it's usually weeks before such probes reach
preliminary findings.
   In Delaware, Murdock said there won't be any problems unless the
oil spilled when the tanker Presidente Rivera ran aground somehow
warmed to 95 degrees or higher and liquefied. Oil blobs were
floating intact below the surface of the 60- to 65-degree water, he
said.
   ``Yesterday we had a clump that had to be 30 gallons in one
piece,'' said David Gartin, operations manager for J&amp;J Spill
Service, Norristown, Pa. ``It was about four feet by four feet and
three feet deep. We just broke pieces off and stuffed them in bags.''
   Gartin said the oil was staying pretty much in the Claymont area,
just south of the Pennsylvania-Delaware border. But tidal action
moved the oil back and forth, up and down the river, and globs were
spotted as far north as Ridley Park, Pa., on the outskirts of
Philadelphia; and as far south as New Castle, Del., about 30 miles
downstream.
   Gartin said he doubted the oil will be cleaned up by the end of
the week.
   Delaware wildlife officials worked to protect Pea Patch Island,
in the river south of New Castle, which is home to several species
of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of oil-retaining booms
along the island.
   As of Monday, only one bird had died, said Dick Nugent, manager
of the Tinicum National Environmental Center, located near
Philadelphia.
   The cause of the tanker's grounding was under investigation. Drug
and alcohol tests were performed on everyone involved in navigating
the ship. The results were not immediately available.
   In Rhode Island Sound, only a few small patches of oil could be
seen Monday, state and federal officials said.
   ``The worst is over,'' said Debbie Payton, an oceanographer with
the Natonal Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. She
estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil remained
floating on the water.
   One of the heaviest patches of remaining oil was just east of
Block Island, but no booms were flown there because the island's
most sensitive shore is on the opposite side, officials said.
   There had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small
birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be
widespread.
   Agents from the FBI and three other state and federal agencies
met with Justice Department attorneys to begin their investigation
of the accident, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond.
   The Coast Guard planned hearings Tuesday into the Rhode Island
and Texas spills.
   State beaches from Jamestown almost to Connecticut remained
closed as a precaution, although eastern beaches were open. A
statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect.
   In Texas, heavy rain from the approaching tropical storm slowed
cleanup Monday, but three more huge vacuum machines were brought in
to help the cleanup for a total of a dozen on the scene, Morehead
said.
   ``The wind makes the (water) choppy and the rain is a pain in the
neck, but they're still going ahead,'' he said.
   Much of the area affected by that spill was industrial.

<HEAD>Harvard, Union Reach Tentative Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Harvard University and its clerical
workers' union said Monday they have reached tentative agreement on
their first contract, culminating 17 years of labor organizing and
four months of negotiations.
   The union's chief negotiator, Kristine Rondeau, said the pact
would provide pay raises averaging 32 percent over the next three
years.
   ``It's the prettiest contract you've ever seen,'' said Rondeau, a
former Harvard Medical School laboratory assistant who led the
campaign that succeeded last year in organizing the 3,500 workers
over strenuous opposition from the university.
   ``It's got great economics and cooperative labor-management
relations, and it addresses the concerns of working women,'' she
said.
   Former U.S. Secretary of Labor John T. Dunlop, a professor of
economics at Harvard, led the university's bargaining team.
   The negotiators, who had been meeting since February, said they
reached agreement in principle late Sunday night. The Harvard Union
of Clerical and Technical Workers is scheduled to hold a
ratification vote Thursday.
   The tentative contract provides several new benefits, including a
$50,000 annual scholarship fund for child care and eight weeks of
paid maternity leave.
   It also gives the workers free use of the university's athletic
facilities, increases their dental and pension benefits and raises
the university's contribution to their health insurance premiums to
85 percent from 70 percent.
   The union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of
State County and Municipal Employees, represents secretaries,
library aides, laboratory personnel and mailroom workers throughout
the university.
   The effort to form a union among the clerical workers, 83 percent
of whom are women, began in 1972. It culminated in a May 17, 1988,
vote that the labor organizers won by 44 votes, or less than 2
percent of the total cast in the 1,530-1,486 decision.
   Harvard President Derek Bok, a former law professor whose
academic writings have been supportive of labor unions, opposed the
union's formation. The university challenged the vote before the
National Labor Relations Board but lost.
   Bok said Monday the university will work with the union to
complete and sign the formal contract. ``We look forwad with
increasing confidence to a positive relationshp between Harvard and
the union,'' he said.
   Rondeau said Dunlop tried to foster an atmosphere of cooperation
and goodwill toward the union in the aftermath of the bitter
organizing battle.
   ``I think he did everything that he could to change the way the
university and the union related to each other, and I think he did a
good job at that,'' she said.
   Dunlop was traveling to Cambridge from New York on Monday evening
and could not be reached for comment.

   TANGIYE POL-I-CHARKI, Afghanistan (AP) _ Bearded, turbaned men
slowly guide their camels, sheep and goats down the mountains and
carry lambs on their shoulders along the rugged path.
   Women in colorful traditional dress and small children run beside
the flock to keep the bleating animals from straying.
   They travel along the potholed road past the artillery guns and
tanks and through this military checkpoint, undisturbed by the
soldiers.
   ``We are free people,'' Habibullah said as he unloaded sacks of
goods from his kneeling camel. ``We are the true spirit of
Afghanistan. Or maybe we're what Afghanistan used to be.''
   Habibullah and the other 15 members of his clan are among the
estimated 2 million Koochi nomads who wander between winter and
summer pastures, pitching their hide tents in fields, building fires
and turning their sheep to graze.
   The Koochis, which means wanderer in the Pashto language, have
traveled the rugged hills and valleys of Afghanstian for thousands
of years. They are ethnic Pathans, like most people in eastern
Afghanistan.
   But unlike their brothers, they never settled down.
   Most still divide their time between the warm lowlands around
Peshawar, Pakistan, and the hilly fields of northern and central
Afghanistan.
   The 11-year-old civil war has made the journey more difficult for
the Koochis. But it hasn't stopped them.
   Kabul, the capital, is a common stopping point for the Koochis,
and their camel trains are as much a part of the urban landscape as
the old bazaars, the military outposts and high-rise apartment
buildings. They halt in Kabul at least once a year to sell camels,
sheep and goats at the meat market.
   ``The Koochi people are an important part of our homeland, an
important part of our tradition. We respect them,'' said Sulaiman
Laeq, the minister of clans and a Politburo member.
   The government has tried to provide them with education, health
and the benefits of progress, such as helping them purchase trucks
and organize a transport union.
   But the Koochis have made it clear they don't want to enter the
modern world, especially if it means owing alligence to the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan or any other government.
   In the early days of the 1978 Marxist revolution that touched off
the civil war, efforts were made to force the Koochis to stop
wandering and settle in the north.
   The move backfired, said the 37-year-old Habibullah. Some of the
Koochis took up guns and joined the Moslem guerrillas in the battle
against the Soviet-backed government troops.
   ``Some are still fighting, but most have returned,'' Habibullah
said through a translator.
   Laeq and other party officials speak of the mistakes the
government made while trying to bring progress to the Koochis.
   Koochi men had never been asked to serve in the Afghan armed
forces, but that tradition was reversed when the Marxists seized
power 11 years ago in a bloody coup.
   By 1985, the government had modified its policy, formally
exempting the Koochi men from government military service.
   But the war has not been easy for the Koochis.
   They often step on land mines planted by the armed forces and by
the Soviets during their nine-year intervention.
   And their travels frequently take them into battle zones near
Jalalabad, an eastern city under rebel siege since early March.
   ``This war has been very bad for our people,'' says another
Koochi leader, Azizullah. ``The bombs, and rockets and land mines
have killed so many of our people.''
   Occasionally, he says, the rebels demand money to allow them to
pass through guerrilla-controlled territory. Often the roads are
neither open nor safe, forcing the Koochis to travel through the
mountains and turning an easy one-day journey into a dangerous,
two-week affair.
   ``We are our own people. We don't want to be on either side,''
says Azizullah. ``We don't want anyone else's war.''

<TEXT>
   Like many small New Mexico towns,
Lordsburg wants new jobs, tourists and its businesses to grow.
   But promoters never dreamed the hottest development deal here in
decades would involve a Manhattan-size landfill that has thrown the
town into the debate over the nation's mounting solid waste problem.
   Immense, isolated and sparsely populated, the Hidalgo County
desert near Mexico has been chosen by a Maryland company for the
commercial landfill. The dump would accommodate up to 20,000 tons of
garbage a day from East Coast cities.
   The proposal was not exactly a secret. A major construction firm,
Driggs Corp. of Capitol Heights, Md., acting locally as Innovative
Environmental Systems of New Mexico, had secured property in the
area and in January asked the state for a landfill permit.
   But elected officials and their constituents _ caught off guard
when news of the proposal surfaced _ sent a shock wave of opposition
that has since reverberated in every New Mexico town and county as
well as the Capitol in Santa Fe.
   Clark Smith, mayor of this southwestern New Mexico town of 3,200
people, recalls that January morning when he saw a map of his town
on the front page of a newspaper:
   ``There's Lordsburg on the map right there, and Driggs, and I
looked at my wife and said, `What is this?' My phone started
ringing, `What is this? What is this?'''
   The 7,300-acre landfill site would sit on 36 square miles now
occupied by lizards, snakes, mesquite brush and yucca. The property
is neatly and conveniently bisected by Interstate 10 and the busy
Southern Pacific Railroad line.
   The opposition moved fast, turning trash into a major
environmental-political issue in New Mexico and focusing attention
on the state's inadequate landfill regulations and the national
quest for suitable landfill space.
   When the 1989 Legislature convened in mid-January, a bill was
introduced to toughen the landfill law and block commercial dumps.
It received overwhelming support.
   But the bill was vetoed by Gov. Garrey Carruthers, who cited
technicalities that he said would have forced the immediate closure
of every landfill in the state. But in March, Carruthers issued a
moratorium outlawing all new commercial landfills except under
special circumstances. The state Environmental Improvement Board
adopted new regulations two months later.
   Hidalgo County, responding to the public demand, also imposed a
landfill moratorium and initiated its first-ever land use planning
effort.
   ``Now that we are aware ... that they are looking at deserts for
landfills, we need to protect ourselves,'' said County Commissioner
Maura Rico.
   Don Sanchez, Driggs' director of special projects who was the
company's local representative, and Ralph Golden, executive vice
president, refused to be interviewed by The Associated Press, citing
fears of adverse publicity.
   However, Innovative Environmental Systems' director, I.M. ``Ike''
Smalley, who retired last year from the state Legislature after 38
years, said Lordsburg residents never waited for a full explanation,
leading to misconceptions about the landfill and its potential
benefits.
   Lordsburg would reap economic benefits, including up to 150 jobs
and a $3 million payroll.
   Few residents are tempted.
   ``My first reaction was that no waste disposal operation of this
size could possibly be a good thing for the community ... no matter
how many jobs it creates,'' said Charlie Hayes, a school
administrator and leader of the opposition.
   Smith also said he worries that New Mexico could get a reputation
as the nation's dump, a status some have conferred because of the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the nation's low- and
intermediate-level nuclear waste repository near Carlsbad.
   And he fears what the landfill would mean to Lordsburg's image
with tourists.
   ``People will come in and say, `Children, we're coming into New
Mexico now. This is where the world's largest dump is.'''

   ``Batman'' made more money in three days than
most movies generate in their lifetimes, with a $42.7 million
opening that broke a week-old record and drove the industry to a
record $90 million-plus weekend.
   Despite attracting less-than-overwhelming reviews, ``Batman,''
starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the
Joker, set new marks for the best opening day with $15.3 million
Friday, according to figures released Monday. It also recorded the
biggest Saturday at $14.6 million and Sunday at $12.7 million in
movie history.
   Those figures were rounded off; the exact figures yielded the
$42.7 million gross, according to John Krier of Exhibitor Relations
Co., which tracks box-office performance.
   The previous opening-weekend record was set a week earlier by
``Ghostbusters II,'' which grossed $29.5 million.
   Overall, American and Canadian movie fans spent more than $95
million at theaters during the weekend, breaking yet another record
by $3 million.
   ``This is tremendous. It is the biggest weekend ever in the
history of the business,'' said Krier.
   This summer's box office is now running 14 percent ahead of last
year's record season of $1.7 billion, according to industry
estimates. Grosses have been boosted by higher ticket prices, up to
$7 in some theaters.
   The unprecedented popularity of Warner Bros.' ``Batman'' may even
have helped the competition, as moviegoers _ perhaps frustrated by
unbearably long ``Batman'' lines at some of its 2,194 screens _
dashed to Disney's modest comedy, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' in
record numbers.
   ``Honey,'' which is being shown with a new 7{-minute Roger Rabbit
cartoon called ``Tummy Trouble,'' collected $14.3 million in its
first weekend to finish in second place. It broke all of Disney's
opening box-office records, including those set by its hits
``Cocktail'' and ``Three Men and a Baby.''
   The Disney production enjoyed the third-best opening weekend of
any non-sequel movie, trailing only ``Batman'' and ``Beverly Hills
Cop,'' the studio said.
   The most noticeable victim of the ``Batman'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids'' onslaught was Columbia's ``Ghostbusters II,'' with
Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, which fell sharply after its record
opening. Finishing third on the box-office charts, ``Ghostbusters
II'' grossed $13.9 million, a collapse of more than 52 percent.
   In fourth place was Paramount's ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' which grossed $8.2 million. It was followed in fifth
place by Disney's ``Dead Poets Society,'' $7.3 million, featuring
Robin Williams as a crusading high-school teacher.
   ``We are so excited about that picture,'' said Richard Cook,
Disney's president of distribution. ``With `Indiana Jones,' `Star
Trek,' `Ghostbusters' and `Batman,' to have this movie performing at
the level that it is .... It's going to be around for a long, long
time.''
   In sixth was ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' the William
Shatner-directed sequel that seems overwhelmed by the summer
competition. After opening strongly two weeks ago, ``Star Trek V''
grossed only $3.7 million over the weekend.
   Universal's baseball movie ``Field of Dreams,'' with Kevin
Costner, landed in seventh with ticket sales of $2.1 million. In
eighth was the comedy ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with estimated
grosses of $1.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Road House'' with $913,000 and
``No Holds Barred'' with $808,000.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Batman,'' Warner Bros., $42.7 million, 2,194 screens,
$19,465 per screen, $42.7 million, one week.
   2. ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' Disney, $14.3 million, 1,371
screens, $10,403 per screen, $14.3 million, one week.
   3. ``Ghostbusters II,'' Columbia, $13.9 million, 2,410 screens,
$5,749 per screen, $58.8 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $8.2
million, 2,103 screens, $3,881 per screen, $136.3 million, five
weeks.
   5. ``Dead Poets Society,'' Disney, $7.3 million, 1,091 screens,
$6,732 per screen, $35.6 million, four weeks.
   6. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $3.7 million,
2,007 screens, $1,866 per screen, $38.3 million, three weeks.
   7. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $2.1 million, 995 screens,
$2,135 per screen, $47.7 million, 10 weeks.
   8. ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $1.6 million, 1,465
screens, $1,085 per screen, $41 million, seven weeks.
   9. ``Road House,'' MGM-UA, $913,093, 1,051 screens, $869 per
screen, $25.7 million, six weeks.
   10. ``No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $808,594, 1,005 screens, $805

<HEAD>EDs: INSERTS new information about ``Robin HUD'' turning over home
to department to cover thefts in new grafs 3-4: ``In addition,'' ADDS three
grafs to elaborate.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
faces some $650 million in loan defaults from nine mortgage
companies whose practices now are under review, a spokesman said
Monday.
   Three of the nine companies have been suspended indefinitely from
doing business with the department, three others have been placed on
probation for six months and three more face examination of their
projects, HUD documents show.
   In addition, Frank Keating, HUD general counsel-designate, said
escrow agent Marilyn Harrell of Washington and agents in Texas and
Alabama became the first agents that HUD would bar from future
government contracts, The Washington Post said in Tuesday editions.
The cases are part of a nationwide investigation of HUD' dealings
with about 280 closing agents who handled government foreclosures.
   Ms. Harrell, whose diversion of $5.5 million from the
government's primary housing subsidy program earned her the nickname
``Robin HUD,'' turned over her house to the department to cover part
of the thefts and moved out on Monday.
   The mortgage companies have been involved in ``coinsurance
programs'' at HUD, under which they earn lucrative fees for
servicing loans for federally backed housing programs but stand to
lose little if the borrower defaults.
   The mortgage companies have to absorb the first 5 percent of the
loss on the loans, but HUD takes 85 prcent of the remaining loss.
   ``Lenders were underwriting unsound loans, overmortgaging
properties, failing to detect indications of troubled loans in a
timely manner, and were not taking adequate and timely actions to
minimize mortgage defaults and coinsurance losses,'' according to a
HUD inspector general's report issued earlier this year.
   That report estimated that loans worth some $700 million were in
default, but Bill Glavin, a HUD spokesman, said some of the
potential losses have been recovered, lowering the overall liability
to $650 million.
   That represents about 13 percent of the money loaned under the
program, he said.
   The lenders suspended indefinitely were DRG Funding Corp. of
Washington, D.C., Puller Mortgage Associates Inc. of Indianapolis
and Southwest Funding Group of Houston. The three on probation
through Nov. 1 are Benton Mortgage Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., Carnegie
Evans L.P. of Greenwich, Conn., and Citadel Mortgage Co. of San
Antonio, Texas.
   The three lenders under review are American Mortgages Inc. of
Bethesda, Md., Eagle Housing Mortgage Group of Dallas and TRI
Capital Corp. of San Francisco.
   At the beginning of May HUD placed a moratorium on the entire
coinsurance program until Sept. 1 while the agency reviews the
program.
   To preempt a federal eviction, Ms. Harrell, 46, spent the weekend
hauling six truckloads of furniture from the house she purchased
with her own money in 1986, including a white baby grand piano and a
large-screen television set. She moved in with her mother nearby.
   Ms. Harrell said she gave HUD the title to her home in December
when her contract as a closing agent for HUD ran out and agents were
asking about millions missing from her title company. She said she
also had transferred to HUD the deeds to five other houses she paid
for with HUD's money and used for various charities and homeless
families.
   Last week, Ms. Harrell said two vans and a pickup truck used by
her company were seized at her business office in Clinton, Md.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Opponents Outraged by Court Ruling on Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Death penalty opponents are calling for new
state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the
wake of Supreme Court rulings they say are ``medieval and barbaric.''
   ``To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before
they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,''
said American Bar Association President Robert Raven.
   ``We strongly urge states to enact legislation which recognizes
that minors ... should not be held to ... the ultimate sanction of
death,'' he said.
   Of the 37 states permitting capital punishment, 15 now bar its
use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18.
   The court, voting 5-4, said Monday the Constitution does not bar
states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young
as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers.
   In the case of the mentally retarded, the justices said convicted
murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider
their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the
death penalty.
   The court upheld the death sentences of a Kentucky murderer who
was 17 when he killed, a Missouri killer who was 16, and a Texas
killer who has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
   Last year, the court decided that 15 was too young for execution.
   The justices, expected to wrap up the current court term on
Thursday, have yet to issue a decision in a closely watched Missouri
case in which the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion is under
attack.
   The court must either announce a decision or schedule the case to
be argued again during its next term beginning in October.
   In other matters Monday, the court:
   _Ruled, 7-2, that skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal
injury lawsuits do not violate the Constitution's ban on excessive
fines. The decision left open the possibility that such hefty awards
violate due-process rights.
   _Said police may stray from the precise wording of the famous
Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects, voting 5-4 to reinstate
an Indiana man's conviction for attempted murder.
   _Unanimously interpreted a key federal anti-racketeering law
broadly in a Minnesota case to make it easier to use the law in
civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud.
   _Agreed to decide in an Ohio case whether states may outlaw
possession of ``lewd'' photographs and films depicting child nudity.
The court in 1982 said states could ban the promotion and
distribution of such material, but stopped short of allowing its
possession to be a crime.
   Law enforcement authorities said the juvenile death penalty
decisions will advance the fight against violent crime.
   ``In an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness
of violent crime, the court's decision ... reaffirms that state
legislators, the juvenile justice system and local juries _ not the
federal courts _ can and should decide upon the proper age to impose
the death penalty,'' said Attorney General Fred Cowan of Kentucky.
   ``Clearly, some 16- and 17-year-olds in our society are fully
mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of
crimes,'' he added. ``The court has obviously responded to society's
demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible
crimes responsible for their actions.''
   The court's juvenile-killers ruling affects about 25 of the 2,200
death row inmates across the nation.
   As for mental retardation, people who function at below-average
intelligence comprise between 12 and 30 percent of all death row
inmates, according to one group opposed to the death penalty.
   The rulings prompted widespread concern among activists for
individual rights.
   ``It is quite appalling that the Supreme Court would read the
Constitution ... as not banning the execution of children,'' said
Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``To let
the society hang children is medieval and barbaric.''
   James Ellis, president of the American Association on Mental
Retardation, said, ``It now falls to state legislatures to assure
that no individual with this disability is ever put to death in this
country. The execution of any such person would represent a tragic
injustice.''
   Michele Coleman of the Missouri Coalition Against the Death
Penalty said the rulings give states ``rein to execute children.''
   But Missouri Attorney General William Webster said the rulings
will not prompt more executions of minors.
   ``I think that's hogwash. There's a lot of people that say it's
going to open the door. That's ludicrous,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wright Quitting Friday; Won't Seek Re-election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former House Speaker Jim Wright says he's
leaving Congress for good on Friday, ending speculation that he
might seek re-election to the seat that ethics charges forced him to
give up.
   Wright issued a statement saying he is gratified by supporters'
calls for him to seek re-election _ and political vindication _ in a
special vote to be called after he steps down.
   ``As deeply as I appreciate the devoted friendship which impels
these sincere petitions, I must conclude that I was right in
announcing my retirement from Congress,'' the Fort Worth, Texas,
Democrat said Monday.
   ``It is best for the institution and best for the people whom
I've served that I step aside now and make room for others,'' he
said. He said his nearly 35-year House career will end Friday and he
will not seek elective office again.
   The House ethics committee had charged Wright with 69 violations,
involving whether he sidestepped House limits on outside income
through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and whether he improperly
accepted $145,000 in gifts from a business partner with a direct
interest in legislation.
   In an emotional speech to the House on May 31, Wright said he
would step down as speaker and resign his House seat by the end of
June. He was replaced as speaker by Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., a
week later.
   But Wright had left open the possibility he might seek
re-election to the House in an attempt to counter the ethics charges
that made him the first House speaker ever to resign under fire. He
said last week he might run if there were ``an absolutely genuine
draft of a bipartisan nature.''
   In Washington, however, colleagues were privately aghast at the
suggestion he might seek to stay on.
   An aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a weekend poll
showing home-district support for Wright figured prominently in the
decision not to run again. ``He just felt like that was
vindication,'' the aide said.
   Sixty-five percent of Wright's constituents who were polled said
they would vote for him again. About 81 percent believed Wright was
doing an ``outstanding'' or ``good'' job in Washington and 67
percent said he gave up too soon in his fight against the ethics
charges.
   The poll, which sampled 407 residents last week and had an error
margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points, appeared in Sunday's
Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   ``To seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one
more time would be vainglorious,'' Wright said in the statement.
``To do so without intending to serve for a prolonged period would
be pointless. To postpone the moment when another may begin would be
a disservice.''
   Had he run again and won, Wright still could have been subject to
disciplinary action by the ethics committee, which apparently
decided to set the case aside after he announced his intention to
resign.
   Wright said he has accepted ``five or six'' invitations to
deliver speeches and is considering ``some limited business and
professional relationships'' and writing opportunities. He will
maintain an office in Fort Worth, he said.
   He and his wife, Betty, plan to attend a ``Welcome Home, Jim''
celebration Thursday in Fort Worth, sponsored by Mayor Bob Bolen and
former Rep. Tom Vandergriff, D-Texas.

   Covering the news in China under the growing
obstacles created by martial law requires more in the way of
imaginative tactics by foreign journalists than derring-do.
   Reporting on China's political crisis has become increasingly
difficult as soldiers and police strictly enforce restrictions on
the press.
   Newsgathering is basically banned under martial law, except for
the infrequent government-orchestrated peasant rally or news
conference.
   But virtually all reporters in the capital and other Chinese
cities ignore the regulations, coming up with their own ways of
getting around martial law.
   ``The most effective trick these days is to act like a dumb
tourist,'' says an Asian photojournalist. ``Wear bright clothes and
shorts, and don't hide your camera.''
   If stopped by security personnel, he says, ``the best defense is
to go on the offense. Ask them some questions. It's better than
trying to run away.''
   Martial law was imposed May 20 in Beijing in a move to quell the
student-led democracy movement that was finally crushed June 4 when
soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the capital.
   Under the vaguely worded decree, foreigners are prohibited from
entering or taking pictures at schools, factories or
``organizations''.
   Television networks face the greatest difficulties. Their
equipment makes them easy to spot.
   ``For television, we don't have a story unless we have a picture
that can convey the information,'' says a CBS News official. ``We
get chased away all the time. We're very frustrated at not being
able to shoot pictures.''
   Coverage has been reduced to relying on government-controlled TV
news.
   ``A great deal of what we're doing is recording their material
and reworking it,'' said the CBS official. ``We're very much at
their mercy.''
   Foreign television networks can no longer send segments through
state-run China Central Television to North America or Europe via
satellite.
   They must now somehow get their videotapes to Hong Kong or Tokyo.
   ``We smuggled out our tapes, did the double shuffle with the
cassettes and that sort,'' said Vernon Mann, a correspondent for
Britain's Independent Television Network whose videotape was
``confiscated'' by police after he filmed on a university campus in
Chengdu, central China.
   ``Our piece, which would have greatly upset them, was aired all
over the U.K. (United Kingdom).''
   Mann was expelled from China for the incident.
   Still photographers have an easier time. One wrapped his camera
in a jacket and put the bundle in his bicycle basket, shooting
frames as he passed soldiers guarding intersections.
   Another put aside his complex single-lens reflex camera and
instead went out with the automatic-focus variety so all he had to
do was point and push.
   Most photographers have resorted to taking pictures from cars,
some with darkened windows, as they zip past soldiers on patrol or
troops checking identification.
   One cameraman from a European photo agency took a dramatic shot
through the back window of a taxi of a man in handcuffs being led
away by soldiers. ``One guy saw me, and I just hit my driver on the
back and said, `Let's get out of here!,''' he said.
   Print journalists face more subtle difficulties.
   With most Chinese frightened into silence by widespread arrests,
including the nationally publicized arrest of a man who talked to an
American television crew, reporters' sources are drying up.
   ``I've simply stopped telephoning people,'' said one American
reporter, noting that he and most colleagues assume their phones are
tapped. ``I think of my Chinese contacts first and foremost as
friends and I've stopped making any attempt to contact them.''
   Other journalists discover that acquaintances refuse to meet
them. A German reporter was turned away when he showed up at the
doorsteps of some Chinese friends. He says now he does not even take
notes on the streets, preferring to keep his eyes open and later
write down what he saw.
   The few who do make appointments do so with great caution,
calling from public telephones, instructing friends not to say their
names in phone conversations, making appointments by prearranged
code and meeting sources furtively in discrete locations.
   ``I only move around at night,'' said a Japanese reporter. ``Even
though it's easier for me to blend into a crowd than Westerners, I
still stand out.''
   He says while many people who have helped him have gone
underground, he hasn't stopped seeing people because ``Chinese have
information you can't get otherwise.''
   He, too, says meetings are much harder to arrange. ``You can't
meet people in hotels _ they have secret cameras everywhere,''
referring to footage taken by a hidden camera of a student leader
feasting at the Beijing Hotel.
   Now he finds the only place he can interview people is in his car
_ during the day, when soldiers aren't checking vehicles for
fugitives.
   ``The greatest danger in China now is that the people have lost
their voice,'' he said. ``The reformists and intellectuals are all
gone. China have lost its good-heartedness.''

<TEXT>
   The strongest earthquake to hit Hawaii in
six years shook a sparsely populated area of Hawaii Island already
ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal
wave.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes
Monday, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   ``Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' Kim said.
``Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.''
   The temblor, caused by the 6{-year-old eruption of Kilauea
Volcano, struck Sunday evening and measured 6.1 on the Richter
scale, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   It was centered west of Kalapana, a small coastal town on the
south flank of the volcano, said Bruce Turner, a geophysicist at the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.
   The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by
the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said Bob
Koyanagi, a seismic analyst at the Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory.
   Reggie Okamura, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists
had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on
the Richter scale, was recorded Sunday night, he said.
   Kilauea lava has destroyed 68 homes in the Kalapana area since
its latest eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Four homes were destroyed in
May, and last Thursday a Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitor
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure.
   Koyanagi said pressure became too great within the world's most
active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the
earthquake.
   The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at Honuapo, 8.4
inches at Kapoho and 5.6 inches at Hilo, caused no damage, Turner
said.
   Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none
required hospitalization, Kim said. Crews were working to repair
downed power lines.
   It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since Nov. 15,
1983, when a 6.6 temblor caused several million dollars damage on
Hawaii Island.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<HEAD>Latest Oil Spills Far Different From Alaskan Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major oil spills in Rhode Island, Delaware and
Texas provided a big challenge for the Coast Guard but the tasks
differed sharply from the massive Alaska spill that is still being
cleaned up three months after it happened.
   ``Here we have a spill that we hoped wouldn't happen, but we were
prepared for it,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt, who worked
on both the Alaskan spill and the spill last Friday at the mouth of
Narragansett Bay off Rhode Island.
   ``Up there in Alaska, it was a spill that couldn't happen, but it
did, '' he said.
   The same pumps used to evacuate 40 million gallons of Alaskan
crude from the Exxon Valdez after it ran aground March 24 in Prince
William Sound and spilled more than 10 million gallons were being
used on the World Prodigy in Naragansett Bay.
   But they were pumping a far different substance.
   While the Alaskan crude continues to pollute shorelines as far as
450 miles away from the original spill, the 420,000 gallons of
refined heating oil that poured out of the World Prodigy have
largely evaporated or dissipated.
   On the Delaware River, cleanup crews were contending with yet a
different consistency: basketball-sized globs of oil from 800,000
gallons that oozed out of a Uraguayan tanker Saturday. But that was
also easier to clean up than the Alaskan crude.
   Coast Guard officials said shoreline damage downriver in
Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey was almost nonexistent because
the oil was thick and was not washing up on the shore. In Alaska, by
contrast, the soft crude seeped deep into beach sand.
   In the Galveston Bay outside Houston, 250,000 gallons of oil that
spilled in the collision of a tanker and a barge was confined to a
small shipping channel and most of the oil that washed ashore
affected only industrial property.
   Weather conditions after both the Alaskan and the recent weekend
spills were mild, but brought far different results. Off the Rhode
Island Coast, the sun speeded up evaporation of the light oil off
the Rhode Island Coast.
   ``In Alaska, what we needed was a storm to break up the oil,''
said Meidt.
   He said booms also were used quickly and effectively in the East
Coast spill to contain and divert the oil in a way that was never
possible after Alaska's midnight spill 25 miles out in Prince
William Sound.
   ``This one was literally in the Coast Guard's backyard,'' said
Meidt. ``We just went out and put a boom around it.''
   Officials said a response system being reviewed as a result of
the Alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling the smaller
spills. But officials still need to know how the response system
would work with a much larger spill.
   David Pascoe, chief of the Coast Guard's environmental response
branch, said that response of officials may have been heightened
over the weekend because of the reviews they are conducting, but he
said there have been no policy or operational changes since the
Alaskan spill.
   No equipment or personnel had to be moved from Alaska for the
latest spills, he said.
   The workload is also being handled differently.
   Exxon is paying thousands of workers to clean up oil in the
Alaskan spill. Private contractors, volunteers, National Guardsmen
and Coast Guard personnel are involved in cleaning up the latest
spills, but shippers have to pay the costs.
   In each of the latest spills, local Coast Guard officials were
overseeing the cleanup, said Pascoe.
   He said it was too early for the Alaskan spill to have much
impact on the way the Coast Guard or other agencies respond to
spills. But he noted Congress is considering several measures to
deal with spills in the wake of the Alaskan disaster. The oil
industry last week announced its own plans for a cooperative
response.

<HEAD>Companies Fined for Failure to Report Toxic Chemical Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of companies face nearly $4 million in
fines because they did not report toxic chemical releases under a
citizens' right-to-know law that took effect last year, says the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The EPA announced its latest enforcement action Monday against
companies that failed to comply with the law, saying that $1.65
million in fines were placed against 42 companies in 20 states.
   The agency previously took action against 43 other companies.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said the agency will continue
to pursue civil penalties against companies that do not comply with
the disclosure law.
   ``We will not allow non-reporting companies to thwart the right
of citizens to find out which toxic chemicals are being released
into their communities,'' said Reilly in a statement.
   The penalties announced Monday ranged from $5,000 to a high of
$262,000 against a California electronics firm, Diceon Electronics,
which allegedly failed to report toxic chemical releases at
facilities in Irvine and Chatsworth, Calif.
   The second highest fine was against International Extrusion
Corp., Waxalachie, Texas, which was assessed a $101,000 penalty.
   Officials from the two companies could not be reached for comment
Monday.
   Nearly 20,000 companies nationwide filed the chemical release
disclosure reports, which covered 1987, before the filing deadline
last July. The statistics recently provided the first detailed
glimpse into the volume of toxic chemicals that are being released
into the air, water and soil by industry each year.
   But the EPA has estimated that about 20 percent of the businesses
subject to the disclosure requirement may not have complied with the
law during the first reporting period.
   The second round of reports covering releases in 1988 are due to
be filed at the end of this month.
   In addition to seeking fines from the 85 companies, the agency
has filed formal notices of noncompliance against more than 1,500
other companies, although no civil penalties in those cases have yet
been sought.
   EPA spokesman Luke Hester said the amount of the fine proposed
against any single company depended on the size of the business,
total quantity of a chemical not reported and quantities
manufactured. Failure to report chemical releases can result in
civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day.
   The companies may appeal the proposed civil penalties and request
a formal hearing.
   The other companies fined in the latest enforcement action were:
   Eyelematic Manufacturing Inc., Watertown, Conn. ($59,000);
Allen's Manufacturing Inc., Providence, R.I. ($5,000); Nyman
Manufacturing Inc., East Providence, R.I. ($17,000); CPC Rexcel,

   President Bush, welcoming five dozen state and
local officials into the GOP, says the political converts are just
part of the ``droves of voters'' being shut out by a left-leaning
Democratic Party.
   Bush, who often extols the virtues of bipartisanship in dealing
with Congress, reached back for some campaign-style rhetoric Monday
at the White House event where the Republicans paraded the
party-switchers.
   ``The Democratic party is leaving droves of voters behind as it
moves over onto the more liberal side, the left side of the
political equation. And now many of those stranded voters have made
a move on their own to the Republican party, our party of family,
faith and the future,'' Bush said.
   Bush had a different sort of White House ceremony on tap today
with plans to greet Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke with full
military honors followed by a private meeting and, in the evening, a
state dinner.
   The emphasis was on politics Monday when the ex-Democrats trekked
through the Oval Office to pose for official pictures with the
president and hear their praises sung in the Rose Garden by Bush,
GOP Chairman Lee Atwater and Rep. Bill Grant of Perry, Fla., who
made his own switch to the GOP in February.
   ``You're tough,'' Grant told the state representatives, judges,
sheriffs, mayors and other officials. At home, he said, ``you're
being accused of being a traitor, turncoat, accused of betraying the
voters by leaving the Democratic Party.''
   Bush praised their political courage and promised to stand
``shoulder to shoulder'' with them as they seek re-election as
Republicans.
   ``The switch is on to the party in sync with the American
principles. The switch is on to the Republican Party,'' said the
president.
   Bush, employing the rhetoric he successfully used to hammer
Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidential campaign, said
Republicans were moving ``in the right direction.''
   The Democrats are ``on the move, too, to the left and out of the
mainstream,'' he said.
   Atwater, embroiled in controversy recently over a GOP attack on
new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, called the event ``absolutely the
proudest single moment I've had since taking office.''
   He said the new Republicans were just part of 118 elected
officials who have switched to the GOP ``since my chairmanship
began'' in January.
   ``And I know of no single example of a Republican party official
... who has switched the other way,'' he said.
   Charles Evers, outgoing mayor of Fayette, Miss., and brother of
slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, said he switched parties
because ``I don't like to be with losers. The Democratic Party is a
loser.''
   Evers added that he didn't want to see an all-white Republican
Party. He said he will try to encourage black voters in Mississippi
to register Republican because blacks are better off with
representation in both parties.
   Dennis Steinberg, an Allenhurst, N.J., dentist and environmental
activist running for the state assembly, was one of only a few
politicians from north of the Mason-Dixon line identified among the
new Republicans.
   He said he changed parties because of Bush's promise to ``make
ending ocean pollution a priority in his administration.''

   First Lady Barbara Bush is springing to the
defense of her spaniel Millie, branded ``ugly'' by Washingtonian
magazine.
   The monthly gave Millie the dubious distinction of being the
``best'' ugly dog in Washington in an offbeat ranking of
bests-and-worsts in the nation's capital.
   It said the White House ``mutt'' has not bitten the president
yet, ``but let's face it: This is a very homely springer spaniel.''
   ``Millie has been slow about writing her book, but this is going
to bring her to action,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters outside the White
House on Monday night after returning with President Bush from a
parade at the Marine Barracks.
   Mrs. Bush ghost wrote an autobiography titled ``C. Fred's Story''
of her previous dog to raise funds for charity.

<HEAD>FDA Makes New Drugs Available to AIDS Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though medical science still has no cure for
AIDS, federal health officials say new therapies and greater access
to experimental drugs are extending and improving the quality of
life of AIDS patients.
   They say this is more reason than ever for people to be tested
for AIDS.
   ``A few years ago, the diagnosis was a death sentence,'' Frank
Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, told
reporters Monday in announcing FDA action on two drugs for
AIDS-related conditions.
   ``Now there's significant hope'' to prolong life by warding off
the infections that invade the weakened immune systems of AIDS
victims, he said. ``The good news is that there are more therapies
that are coming to treat the disease early.''
   Commercial approval was granted for the drug ganciclovir for
treatment of an eye infection that can lead to blindness in AIDS
patients. About one in every four AIDS patients gets cytomegalovirus
retinitis.
   The FDA also is allowing expanded pre-market distribution of an
experimental protien, r-erythropoietin, to treat severe anemia that
weakens nearly half of the 20,000 patients taking the AIDS-fighting
drug AZT.
   Earlier this month, the FDA approved aerosol pentamidine to
prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills about 60 percent
of AIDS victims.
   ``These are important advances, but the disease still remains
demonic,'' Young said.
   Though there is still no cure or vaccine, ``people need to know
as early as possible what the diagnosis is so they can get the
proper care.''
   The FDA, criticized by AIDS advocates for moving too slowly in
getting promising drugs to patients, has been moving the approval
process more quickly while still assuring that experimental drugs
are safe.
   Using a special treatment category formally instituted two years
ago, the FDA allows pre-market distribution of a drug that has been
shown to be safe and may be effective. With this status, called
``treatment investigational new drug,'' or treatment IND, a drug can
be distributed more widely while research on its effectiveness
continues.
   Young said the FDA has also been working with the National
Institutes of Health to develop another avenue designed to give more
AIDS patients access to experimental drugs. This system would allow
experimental drugs to be distributed to AIDS patients who do not fit
the criteria demanded for a clinical trial. Young said it could
allow access to drugs several months earlier than a treatment IND,
he said.
   More than 100 drugs are being investigated for treatment of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and AIDS-related conditions, he
said. So far, four have been approved, but only one _ zidovudine, or
AZT _ is aimed at stemming the AIDS viral infection itself. The
other three _ ganciclovir, aerosol pentamidine and alpha interferon
_ are used to treat AIDS-related conditions.
   The FDA said that though studies have shown ganciclovir to be
effective in retarding the sight-threatening infection, extensive
post-marketing studies are needed to determine whether patients on
AZT can also take ganciclovir. Both drugs are highly toxic. Syntex
Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif., will market ganciclovir under the trade
name Cytovene.
   R-erythropoietin is one of more than a dozen drugs with treatment
IND status, and the fifth AIDS-related drug to have reached this
category. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., is sponsoring
the drug and will make it available free to patients while the
studies continue.

<HEAD>Tanker Accidents Raise Political Heat on Oil Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The latest oil shipping accidents in U.S. waters are
raising the likelihood Congress will widen restrictions on drilling
in promising areas off the shores of Alaska, California and other
states, oil industry analysts and lawmakers say.
   The House Appropriations Committee is to consider Wednesday a
bill containing tough limits on oil development in the Bristol Bay
area of the southern Bering Sea and in federally controlled waters
off California, New England and the Florida Keys.
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., predicted Monday the legislation will
pass the full Congress this session, in part because of publicity
about oil spills over the weekend in the Delaware River, in
Houston's ship channel and near Newport, R.I.
   ``They just point out how delicate the near-shore environment
is,'' Pallone said in an interview. He wrote letters to several
major oil companies earlier this month asking them not to bid for
federal lease sales off the New England coast.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the
latest spills show the ``pervasiveness of the problem'' but don't
require new steps by President Bush such as initiatives to limit oil
exploration.
   The latest spills were a significant blow to the oil industry,
which is still reeling from the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill
March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   That accident, the worst spill in U.S. history, almost
immediately killed chances for congressional approval of legislation
to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, on Alaska's North
Slope, to oil and natural gas exploration.
   A further consequence of the recent tanker accidents _ and public
criticism of the industry's cleanup response _ may be a new ban on
exploration in Bristol Bay, a rich fishing area Alaska's state
government says is more vulnerable to spill damage than Prince
William Sound.
   ``They'll stop Bristol Bay'' exploration, Dillard Spriggs,
president of the New York consulting company Petroleum Analysis
Ltd., said Monday. ``It's going to be hard to explore very much in
Alaska'' until the industry improves its public image.
   Although most of the Capitol Hill focus on offshore oil
exploration has been limited to Alaska, California, Florida and New
England, movements to ban or slow down drilling have emerged in
Oregon, Washington, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   The oil industry, long aware of political pressures to limit
offshore drilling, until recently sought to rely on its past safety
record and assertions that less domestic drilling will mean more
U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers.
   But since the Valdez accident exposed the industry's inability to
handle large-scale spills, oil companies have tried to take the
offensive by promising to devote more money, personnel and equipment
to responding to major accidents.
   The latest spills came just days after a special task force of
oil executives announced plans to spend $250 million over five years
to create a nationwide network of cleanup equipment and workers to
handle a major spill on any coastal waterway. The cleanup system is
not expected to be working until next summer.
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the major oil
companies, gave a muted response to the weekend spills. It said
although its proposed regional response centers will be designed to
handle worse disasters, the centers could have been called into
action by the government if they had been in place.
   The industry counters anti-drilling arguments by noting that U.S.
dependence on foreign oil has risen sharply in recent years.
Imported oil makes up about 45 percent of total U.S. supplies and
the foreign share is expected to grow unless major oil fields are
discovered on federal land.
   The industry and the Bush administration say such reliance on
foreign suppliers undermines U.S. energy security and means more
environmental risk from foreign tanker traffic.
   Bush is awaiting the recommendations of a task force he assembled
in March to review potential environment damage from oil and natural
gas drilling in federal waters off northern and southern California
and the southern Gulf coast of Florida. The group is to report by
Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities are at their lowest level in more than six months.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.4 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.07 percent, down
from 8.22 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent, down
from 8.08 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.98
percent last Dec. 12 and six-month bills averaged 7.71 percent last
Nov. 7.
   The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _
8.35 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,796.00 and 8.21 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,606.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the average
yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 8.53 percent last
week, up from 8.45 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Problems May be Everywhere in HUD, Investigators Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abuse and mismanagement may be everywhere in
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, say investigators
who confess they don't know where their probe will be headed next.
   ``We have made the assumption that there is a problem within
every unit within HUD, and until we learn that there isn't, we're
going to assume that there is,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., a member of the congressional panel investigating the
department.
   So far, the investigations have roamed from one unrelated program
to the next and have been shotgunned from one part of the nation to
another.
   A sampling from around the country:
   _In Denver, U.S. Attorney Mike Norton says his office is
investigating allegations that a suspended HUD accountant embezzled
some $1 million in housing funds.
   _In Indianapolis, auditors are trying to account for $176,965
arising from 11 property sales.
   _In Philadelphia, a pair of real estate brokers are awaiting
trial on charges of defrauding HUD of more than $900,000.
   _In Atlanta, U.S. Attorney Robert Barr's office has filed a civil
suit against two Atlanta men the Justice Department says kept
proceeds from HUD real estate closings. The lawsuit, which contends
HUD lost $840,000 in payments and $860,000 in interest, seeks $7.5
million in damages.
   _In the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C., a private escrow
agent has confessed to stealing more than $5 million from HUD. Her
role was to help the department close on sales of repossessed homes
by signing papers and accepting the buyers' money for the property.
Marilyn Harrell, nicknamed ``Robin HUD'' because she gave some of
the stolen money to the poor, told investigators her operation was
simple: She just didn't give the government its money.
   On Monday, Ms. Harrell turned over her house to the department to
cover part of the thefts. Ms. Harrell and unidentified agents in
Texas and Alabama became the first agents that HUD will bar from
future government contracts, the Washington Post reported today,
quoting Frank Keating, HUD general counsel-designate.
   Investigations involve 11 other private escrow agents around the
country, and as much as $20 million of HUD funds may have been taken
this way, according to Paul Adams, the department's inspector
general.
   On another front, revealed just this week, HUD has moved to halt
losses from a loan program where some $650 million in mortgages are
in default. The department moved swiftly to suspend three mortgage
companies indefinitely, put three others on six-month probations and
review the operations of still three more.
   HUD officials say a certain amount of fraud is to be expected in
a $20 billion government agency involved chiefly in making loans and
giving away money to help people get shelter and aid the nation's
cities.
   But what began quietly as an in-house investigation more than a
year ago has since exploded into charges of influence-peddling,
betrayal and mismanagement by the people who once held the highest
offices in the department.
   Former Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. has been criticized for his
hands-off style of management. His onetime top aide, Deborah Gore
Dean, invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about her role in
handing out HUD grants to developers who sometimes paid six-figure
sums to big-name Republicans to get favorable consideration for
their projects.
   Geography made little difference. Money went to projects in New
Jersey as well as those in New Mexico.
   ``The problem was at the top,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
another member of the House committee investigating HUD. ``Deborah
Dean was in charge of America.''
   Shays agreed.
   ``People who were not fit to hold office were in charge of that
agency,'' he said Monday. ``Mr. Pierce had a good resume. He
inherited an agency in disarray and left it worse than he found it.''
   ``There is always a problem in a democratic society of a
push-pull,'' said Frank. ``The people who are trying to politicize a
program are pulling against the people who are trying to run it
non-politically.
   ``The difference with HUD was there were no people with real
authority to run it non-politically, that you had people in charge
at the top who just didn't care about the program.''

<HEAD>Drug Czar Defends Staff's Experience, Pace of Effort</HEAD>

   Drug czar William J. Bennett rejects criticism
that he has hired people inexperienced with drug issues, saying his
assistants understand the problem and what they don't know, he finds
out from his ``kitchen cabinet.''
   ``There's plenty of experience,'' Bennett said in an interview.
``There isn't anybody who knows all of it. All the people here know
various pieces. We call on our colleagues in the government all the
time, certainly on the Hill too.''
   He can call on other experts to fill in some of the gaps, said
Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   ``Calling in the experts is fine,'' he said. ``You don't have to
have everybody on staff. I've been given a fairly small staff and I
have to make it travel a long way.''
   Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee's Task Force on International Narcotics, and New
York City's chief narcotics officer said in interviews that Bennett
will have difficulty drawing up a national drug strategy, due in
September, with his current staff.
   The comments echoed criticisms against Bennett by some federal
officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``He's not going to be able to draw up a comprehensive strategy
... and prevent turf wars and figure out how to minimize duplication
without having people who have worked in the agencies and know how
to do that,'' Smith said.
   ``Bennett himself, without any real drug experience, has
surrounded himself with people who don't have any real drug
experience, and, without that, they're going to be operating in a
vacuum,'' he said.
   Sterling Johnson Jr., New York City's special narcotics
prosecutor, said, ``There is no one that I know of with any real law
enforcement experience on his team.''
   Johnson said Bennett has asked him to join his ``kitchen
cabinet'' of unofficial advisers and he'll probably do so.
   ``I told him that I want him to succeed. If he fails, we all
fail,'' said Johnson.
   John Walters, Bennett's chief of staff, defended the office's
experience, saying more than half of its 60 workers have been sent
there from ``every major federal agency involved in anti-drug
efforts.''
   Some three dozen federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Coast Guard and the departments of Education and
Health and Human Services, are part of the war against illegal drugs.
   Some of the officials criticizing Bennett come from agencies that
opposed Congress' creation of his office, which is charged with
scrutinizing their budgets and priorities as it develops a national
strategy.
   That oversight role, as well as traditional rivalry between
agencies, may be responsible for some of the complaints, Walters
said in an interview.
   ``Frankly, I am suspicious of some of the offers for help,
because those take the form of a desire to write the strategy for us
from people in particular agencies, on the Hill and elsewhere,''
Walters said. ``We want competent staff help, but we do not want
someone to do our job for us.''
   Bennett also has generated criticism by deciding not to fill many
permanent positions until his top two deputies are in place,
depending for now on temporary staffers detailed from other agencies.
   His candidates for the deputy slots _ U.S. Marshals Service
Director Stanley Morris for the supply reduction job and Dr. Herbert
Kleber of Yale University for the demand reduction job _ have not
yet been nominated by the White House. Kleber is already on the
payroll as a consultant.
   Bennett said he has urged the White House to act on the
nominations and he presumed the need for thorough background checks
was causing the delay.
   But he added that he consults with both men regularly and the
empty posts will not hinder preparation of an anti-drug strategy.

<HEAD>West Germany Moving Against Firm in Iran Chemical Weapons Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government is taking action
against a German firm that arranged the sale to Iran of chemicals
used in the production of poison gas, according to U.S. officials.
   ``We've been very happy'' with the West German response, one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press Monday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed the sale with
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher during Genscher's visit to
the United States last week, the officials said.
   The officials said they did not have precise details of exactly
what West Germany was doing in the case, which they said involved a
Dusseldorf firm they did not identify.
   The New York Times reported today that the firm had arranged the
sale to Iran of hundreds of tons of thionyl chloride, a chemical
used in the manufacture of mustard gas, by an Indian manufacturer.
   The bulk of the chemicals was not delivered, according to the
Times.
   During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Iran complained that its
people and troops were the targets of several gas attacks by Iraq.
   Last winter, U.S. officials accused German firms of helping Libya
built a plant that could be used to produce chemical weapons, though
Libya insisted the plant would be used for pharmaceuticals.
   In response, the Bonn government has proposed legislation to
stiffen export controls and penalties.

   Actress Robin Givens says ex-husband Mike
Tyson threatened to kill her at times and on one occasion even
placed a pillow over her head, according to a published report.
   ``Michael told me that he was going to kill me and that the world
would be grateful because he's made them think that I'm bad,''
Givens said in an interview published in the July 1 issue of TV
Guide magazine.
   Tyson's attorney, Howard Weitzman, said that when he told Tyson
of the comments, the boxer shrugged and said, ``Come on, man.''
   A new biography of Tyson, ``Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of
Mike Tyson,'' describes him as a wife-beater who reportedly said
that he never hit an opponent as hard as he hit Givens on one
occasion.
   The two were married Feb. 7, 1988, and Givens filed for divorce
in October. The divorce was finalized last month.
   Even though she said Tyson hit her at times, Givens said she
still loves him.
   ``What people don't understand, what they have forgotten in all
this, is: I love Michael.''

   Rob Lowe's lawyer challenged a federal lawsuit by
the mother of a teen-age girl who allegedly was videotaped with the
actor during a sexual encounter.
   Attorney Edgar Neely III told U.S. District Judge G. Ernest
Tidwell on Monday that Georgia law allows only a custodial parent
the right to sue on a matter concerning a child. Neely said Lena Jan
Parsons' parents have divorced during the past year and her father,
John Parsons, was granted custody.
   The attorney also argued that the mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, has
suffered no direct harm from the tape, which has been copied, widely
circulated and shown in edited form on television.
   Tidwell did not indicate when he would rule on the motion to
dismiss the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit filed last month accused Lowe of seducing the
then-16-year-old Miss Parsons during the 1988 Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Lowe inflicted emotional
harm on the mother and seeks unspecified damages.
   Mrs. Wilson's attorney, Hue Henry, said Miss Parsons was living
with her mother at the time the videotape was made, and that the
tape has caused direct harm by humiliating the family and straining
the parent-daughter relationship.
   Lowe, the 25-year-old star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire''
and ``About Last Night,'' did not attend the hearing.

   NBC sportscaster Marv Albert met his wife at
Shea Stadium, and she had to pass a sports quiz before their
relationship got serious.
   Their home on New York's Long Island is a veritable house of
games, with at least 15 televisions and five VCRs, two pools (indoor
and outdoor), a hot tub, tennis court and volleyball pit, an arcade
style table-hockey game that plays the national anthem, a
regulation-height basketball rim and a lower rim where the 5-foot-11
Albert can slam dunk.
   Albert's wife, Benita, had a cement stoop built near the tennis
courts so her husband could relive his Brooklyn childhood by playing
stoop ball, according to the July 1 issue of TV Guide magazine.
   Benita was ushering at the first night game at Shea in April 1964
when Albert spied her. He taped a phony interview and said he needed
her home phone number.
   Benita impressed Albert with her knowledge of sports. She not
only knew ERA stood for earned run average. She also knew how to
calculate the figure.
   Benita Albert gets pretty wild at sports events, especially New
York Knicks games, her husband said.
   ``Nobody wants to sit with her,'' Albert said.

   As Batmania sweeps the nation, Donald
O'Neill sweeps the film hero's furry namesakes from Michigan homes.
   O'Neill is known as the Batman of Oakland County, but he isn't a
caped crusader. He's an exterminator.
   Instead of Bathooks and Batarangs, O'Neill's tools are a good
flashlight, a net, and a 4-wheel-drive Ford Ranger for cruising the
roads northwest of Detroit.
   O'Neill's Bounty Hunter pest control company rids old mansions
and abandoned buildings of the flying mammals. He braves rotting
stairs, dusty attics and damp cellars in pursuit of his prey.
   ``I figure I've done thousands of (bat calls),'' said O'Neill,
59. ``From just one which flew in a living room window to a colony
of hundreds inside a church.''
   ``The Batman is a nickname I picked up as a salesman for a
pesticide company. I held the record for selling more bat stuff than
anyone else around,'' he said.
   ``Batman,'' the film, batted a week-old box office record out of
the park to earn $42.7 million its first three days in release.

   A freelance paleontologist was explaining
to a group of 7-year-olds what dinosaur bones looked like when he
stumbled on the real thing.
   The June 10 birthday party outing led by Peter Kranz to a housing
construction site resulted in the discovery of what may be the most
complete fossilized skeleton of the Dinosaur Age found in the
Washington, D.C., area in a century, said Nicholas Hotton, a
research curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian Institution's
Museum of Natural History.
   Kranz said he was describing fossilized dinosaur bones to the
children when he found a chunk of dark carbon. Other fragments were
uncovered, then Kranz sent the young amateurs home and called the
Smithsonian.
   ``I was nervous about handling such a large specimen,'' Kranz
said. Hotton exposed more of the find and confirmed its significance.
   The find included a portion of the head and skeleton of a 20-foot
mosasaur, a large seagoing predatory lizard that thrived during the
Late Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, said Hotton, who
has worked at the Smithsonian for 30 years, specializing in fossil
reptiles.
   For Kranz, the find is especially timely. His book, ``Dinosaurs
in Maryland,'' has just been published as part of an educational
series by the Maryland Geological Survey. Kranz teaches classes in
natural history for students from kindergarten to graduate school.

<HEAD>Report: Romania Pulling Down Fence on Hungarian Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania is tearing down a barbed wire
fence it had constructed along the Hungarian border in an apparent
bid to stop people from fleeing, the state-run MTI news agency
reported.
   At a human rights conference in Paris last week, even the Soviet
Union criticized its Warsaw Pact ally for putting up the fence.
   ``The `wire curtain' and the concrete pillars were almost
completely removed from Saturday to Monday,'' MTI said Monday.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, on a visit to Austria,
said Monday, ``I haven't heard it yet, but the news delights me.''
   Horn called for Romania to re-establish an autonomous region to
safeguard ethnic and cultural rights of its 1.7 million-member
Hungarian minority. Many ethnic Hungarians have fled Romania,
complaining of persecution.
   MTI said the dismantling of the fence was announced by Col. Janos
Pal, commander of Hungarian frontier guards in the Oroshaza
district..
   During the first five months of this year, 3,231 Romanians
crossed illegally into Hungary, Hungarian officials said.
   About 30,000 Romanians have fled to Hungary in recent years
seeking refuge from chronic hardships and discrimination under
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Relations between Hungary and Romania have been deterioratating.
   As Communist authorities in Budapest prepare to embrace
multiparty democracy and free elections next year, Ceausescu's
hard-line government is going ahead with plans to raze thousands of
villages to force assimilation.
   MTI reported June 20 that Romania had completed a barbed wire
fence 6{ feet to 8\ feet high along 90 percent of the countries'
common border.
   A subsequent MTI report said Romanian authorities had piled sand
on roads leading to the border, apparently to block traffic, and
border guards had noticed a kind of steel ``car trap.''
   MTI said Romania started building the fence 1{ years ago, but the
pace of construction was speeded up in March.

   A commuter plane caught fire just after
takeoff today in the southern city of Kaohsiung, clipped an
apartment building and crashed, killing 12 of the 13 people on

   The Formosa Airlines twin-prop Cessna 404 had just taken off from

<HEAD>House Panel Says Federal Mining Agency Violated Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government cleared the way for
strip mining in a national forest in Ohio after a skimpy review and
without independent documentation, congressional investigators say.
   ``No record exists which suggests that the Office of Surface
Mining conducted a thorough analysis'' before deciding a coal
company had a legal right to strip mine in Wayne National Forest,
said a report by the House Interior Committee's mining subcommittee.
   The agency violated its own policy when it determined Belville
Coal Co. could strip mine for coal on 5,440 acres of the
government-protected land in southern Ohio, the report said.
   ``It is improper for the Office of Surface Mining to have based
this decision on considerations other than its stated policy,'' it
concluded. ``It is inappropriate for a decision of this magnitude
... to have been based on a dearth of written independent agency
analysis and supporting agency documentation.''
   Interior Department spokesman John Wright on Monday said a deputy
assistant secretary was reviewing the Wayne Forest determination
``to see what prompted the decision, how it was based.'' The Office
of Surface Mining is part of the Interior Department.

   Columnist Jack Anderson has rejected a
reprimand he was issued for his ``role in bringing a gun into the
Capitol'' for a television show on terrorism.
   Anderson has said he engineered the plan to smuggle the gun into
the Capitol last month to show a need for better security. He did
not carry in the gun himself.
   The reprimand was issued Monday by a five-member committee of
journalists which provides credentials to reporters who cover
Congress. Anderson, in a response, said, ``With no disrepect
intended, I must reject the reprimand of the standing committee.''
   During a May 24 interview with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., in Dole's
private office, Anderson pulled from his pocket a gun that had been
concealed in his televison crew's equipment. The incident occurred
during taping for a segment of his TV program and Anderson claimed
it was to demonstrate security breaches in the building.
   It is a felony to bring a firearm onto the Capitol grounds or
into any of the congressional office buildings, and Capitol police
and the U.S. attorney are investigating whether to press charges
against Anderson, said officer Dan Nichols.

   The dollar ended sharply higher against the Japanese
yen Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 95.11 points the
previous day, shed 156.61 points, or 0.47 percent, ending the day at
33,469.21 points.
   The dollar closed at 141.23 yen, up 1.05 yen from Monday's
140.18-yen finish. Opening at 141.15 yen, the dollar fluctuated
between 140.90 yen and 141.30 yen.
   Trading was extremely light in the absence of market-affecting
news, said Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co. ``Trading was almost dead,'' he said.
   ``Japanese investors lost incentives to buy the yen following the
Liberal Democratic Party's election loss on Sunday,'' Kanai said.
   Socialist Party candidate Kinuko Ofuchi defeated the candidate of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in a by-election Sunday in
Niigata, northern Japan, winning a seat in Parliament's upper house.
   Japanese investors are gradually unloading yens due to their
pessimism over the Liberal Democrats' prospects in an upper house
election scheduled for July 23, Kanai said.
   On the stock exchange, dealers attributed weaker prices to the
yen's slip against the dollar.
   A dealer with Nikko Securities said Japanese participants
remained on the sidelines and avoided major moves ``mainly because
of the lower yen.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An overnight loss in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York
also discouraged Japanese investors, he said.
   ``External factors were not favorable enough to prompt buying
incentives,'' the dealer added.

<HEAD>Bush, Two State Senates Call for Flag-burning Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and senates in Illinois and California want
penalties for desecrating Old Glory, and a town that prides itself
as ``Flag City USA'' planned a rally against a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling permitting flag burning.
   ``We take our patriotism very seriously in Findlay,'' said
Marjory Buckingham, organizer of a Rally for Flag and Country
planned for Thursday in the northwest Ohio city. ``We feel that any
desecration of the flag is wrong, and people who burn flags should
know how we feel.''
   The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that burning the American flag
as a form of protest is protected by free-speech guarantees.
   ``If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment,
it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable,'' Justice William J. Brennan said in his opinion for
the court.
   The U.S. Senate reacted Friday by passing legislation aimed at
making desecration of the flag unlawful, and the House may consider
a similar resolution this week.
   Bush supports legislation prohibiting the desecration of the
flag, but has not decided whether to back a constitutional
amendement, his spokesman said Monday.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``shares the views of
members of Congress and others who have all expressed their feeling
that the flag should not be desecrated in any way.''
   Bush, who said after the ruling that flag burning is ``dead
wrong,'' told The New York Times in an interview published today
that he has asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Chief of
Staff John H. Sununu to recommend ways to circumvent the Supreme
Court decision.
   Bush said he was ``open-minded'' about how to protect the flag.
Lawmakers are divided on whether to offer legislation or seek a
constitutional amendment.
   In Sacramento, the California Assembly voted 58-2 Monday to ask
Congress to amend the Constitution to outlaw flag burning.
   ``What kind of message are we sending our children when we say
it's OK to burn the flag?'' Republican Assemblyman Tim Leslie asked
in a debate in which he described his father's death during World
War II and displayed the flag used for his father's services.
   Democratic Assemblyman John Burton, who opposed the resolution,
said ``our country is great because we allow people to be wrong ...
and do some stupidly outrageous things.''
   In Illinois, the Senate unanimously approved a bill Monday that
would make it a felony to intentionally place the flag on a floor.
Offenders could receive up to six years in prison. The measure goes
to Gov. James R. Thompson.
   The bill was one of several proposed in response to an Art
Institute of Chicago exhibit that featured a flag on the gallery
floor.
   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. Thomas Dunn, said placing the
flag on the floor is ``the most insulting thing to do in this
country.''
   The Senate on Friday also approved a resolution that calls for
Congress to take measures to protect the flag from desecration.
   In Findlay, about 1,000 people are expected to attend the rally,
Ms. Buckingham said.
   ``It's a hard pill to swallow that the Supreme Court would pass a
ruling that would support the burning of the American flag after
Americans have given their lives for it,'' said Thomas Mazey,
commander of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in the Ohio town.

<HEAD>Four Cases of HIV-2 Confirmed in NYC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strain of the AIDS virus that's widespread in
west Africa but is rare in the United States has infected at least
four people in New York City, authorities said.
   The four confirmed and two unconfirmed but likely cases of HIV-2
infections represent the largest concentration of such infections in
North America, The New York Times reported today.
   They were discovered among hundreds of blood samples from people
who sought to be tested for AIDS in New York City, officials said.
   ``The bad news is that, yes, HIV-2 infection is here,'' said city
Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen C. Joseph. ``The good news is it
apparently has not gotten into the blood supply.''
   HIV-2 is not always detected by standard AIDS tests. The finding
means uncertainty for people who already have passed such tests and
also means blood banks will have a tougher time making sure a
donation is AIDS-free.
   But AIDS researchers say the number of HIV-2-infected people in
the United States is probably small and mostly limited to immigrants
from western Africa, the Times said.
   Dr. James Curran, director of AIDS programs at the federal
Centers for Disease Control, said that while HIV-2 cases are likely
to become more common in this country, ``It is not currently a great
threat to the public.''
   Curran said that outside New York, there have been fewer than 10
reports of HIV-2 infections in the country.
   The standard AIDS test is designed to detect antibodies generated
by the HIV-1 virus. It is able to detect HIV-2 between 45 percent
and 90 percent of the time, Curran said, citing figures presented at
an international AIDS conference in Montreal.
   Health officials say America's blood supply appears safe. If an
AIDS test is inconclusive, blood banks discard the donation. And
blood banks routinely ask donors who are in high AIDS-risk groups
not to give blood, or to donate it for research rather than
transfusion.
   Health experts disagree on whether HIV-2 is as dangerous as HIV-1.
   Some studies suggest that fewer HIV-2-infected people go on to
develop full-blown AIDS. But researchers note that HIV-1 has had
longer to spread and develop and that the development of symptoms
may take more time in an HIV-2 infection.

<TEXT>
   A tribunal of Cuba's highest-ranking military
officers recommended early today that a highly-decorated general be
court-martialed for allegedly organizing rings that trafficked in
cocaine, ivory and diamonds.
   The state-run news agency Prensa Latina said the 47-member
tribunal recommended after two days of hearings that Division Gen.
Arnalfo Ochoa be dishonorably discharged and lose all his military
honors.
   The panel called Ochoa's acts a serious blow to Cuba's
international prestige and said they threatened national security.
It said a ``serious lack of moral character and corruption,
dishonest management, improper use and pilferage of economic
resources'' had been proved.
   In testimony broadcast by state-run television Monday, witnesses
told of officers under Ochoa's 1987-88 command in Angola selling
troops' supplies on the black market, smuggling diamonds and ivory
and receiving kickbacks.
   They also said he had helped Colombian cocaine bosses use Cuba as
a way station for smuggling operations to the United States.
   The witnesses _ three colonels, two lieutenant colonels and two
captains _ testified before the tribunal on Sunday, the day Ochoa
admitted guilt and ``accepted responsibility'' for his actions,
according to Prensa Latina.
   Defense Minister Gen. Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel
Castro, told the tribunal Sunday that Ochoa's punishment should
``set an example.''
   Some Foreign Ministry officials interpreted this to mean Ochoa
might face a firing squad. But others speculated Ochoa might be
spared because of his combat service, his long friendship with the
defense chief and his high rank.
   In their testimony, the witnesses gave detailed accounts of black
market dealings involving diamonds, ivory, sugar, TV sets, tape
recorders, coffee, wheat, dried fish and sides of beef.
   Most said they had believed the sales and conversion of the
proceeds into dollars were geared to shoring up the troubled Cuban
economy. They also said they believed the money was meant to improve
the quality of life of the Cuban troops in Angola, who were helping
the Marxist goverment fight guerrillas.
   At least $200,000 of the proceeds from those sales ended up in a
Panamanian bank account apparently managed by Ochoa, witnesses said.
   They testified that part of the money went toward buying
refrigerators, stereo equipment, juice extractors, a bed, and
clothing for several officers, including Ochoa.
   Capt. Jorge Martinez Valdez, Ochoa's assistant and one of the
witnesses, testified that he began money-laundering transactions
with Panamanians and Colombians as early as 1985 on behalf of Ochoa.
   He described direct contacts with leaders of the Medellin cartel,
the world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation, based in Colombia.
   Martinez said that the Colombians were under the impression that
their Cuban connection had official sanction.
   ``The Colombians thought that we were official representatives of
Cuba,'' Martinez testified. ``In the visit to Cuba, they were put up
at an official protocol house and a Mercedes-Benz was placed at
their disposal.''
   Martinez said the Colombians, during one of their three visits to
Cuba, proposed printing dollars in Cuba and even setting up a
cocaine laboratory on the Caribbean island. He said the Cuban
officers involved only accepted helping the Colombians push their
product toward the United States.
   Martinez said he traveled to Colombia on a false passport
provided by the cartel and met with cartel head Pablo Escobar. He
said the drug lord talked about obtaining some ground-to-air
missiles ``for his own personal protection so he could defend
himself against helicopters.''
   Cuba has mounted an intensive public relations campaign against
Ochoa, describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary detail in
Granma, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.
   In a break from its usual reticence to report on internal
affairs, Prensa Latina has distributed extensive reports on the drug
scandal.
   Ochoa was decorated for his service as a field commander in
Angola in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever
awarded the Hero of the Republic of Cuba.

   A grant from a tobacco company is
keeping the National Women's Hall of Fame open, and one of the
nation's leading feminists is incensed.
   After launching an urgent fund-raising drive June 13, the hall's
board of directors on Monday announced that a $35,000 donation from
the Philip Morris Companies and a $100,000 Gannett Foundation grant
would provide funds for five years.
   But the decision to take money from Philip Morris, whose products
include cigarettes, drew heat from Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women.
   ``Smoking is a feminist issue,'' Yard said. ``Cigarettes are
killing women. Women's organizations are going to have to stop
taking money from the merchants of death.''
   The news of the donations brought hearty applause from a meeting
of about 50 hall members led by Board President Jane E. Howland.
   Howland said she is a former smoker and ``I think everybody ought
to quit.'' But she said smoking ``is still legal in this country. I
might feel a little different if it was the Mafia; I might not as
long as the money was there.''
   The hall, founded in 1968, is located in an old bank building in
this upstate New York village that bills itself as ``The Birthplace
of Women's Rights.'' Elizabeth Cady Stanton and 300 other women held
the first U.S. women's right convention here in 1848 and issued a
demand for equal schooling and wages for women, as well as suffrage.
   The Women's Rights National Historical Park, which commemorates
that event, is funded by the Department of the Interior.
   But the hall, a private, non-profit educational institute, had
overdrawn its operating account and was $68,000 in debt before the
drive.
   Philip Morris spokeswoman Posie DiSesa said the company made its
donation of $10,000 in cash and $25,000 in public relations and
fund-raising services out of ``corporate benevolence,'' and did not
expect any promotion in exchange.
   Despite her displeasure with the Philip Morris donation, Yard
said it was important to keep the hall open.
   ``It's the only place in the country where there's any attempt to
keep records of leading American women,'' she said.
   An earlier appeal for funds the national women's organizations
might have made it unnecessary to resort to Philip Morris, she said.
   One former president of the National Organization for Women
defended the decision.
   ``It seems to me they have a perfect right to be involved,'' said
Karen DeCrow, now an attorney in Syracuse. ``I hope people don't
drink and drive and I hope kids don't smoke cigarettes, but that
doesn't mean they can't be involved.''

<HEAD>Critics Lash Supreme Court Ruling as `Barbaric'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Scotus Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors praised Supreme Court decisions that allow the
execution of teen-age or retarded murderers, but defense attorneys
and civil rights groups said the rulings degraded the nation.
   In two 5-4 votes Monday, the Supreme Court said the
Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit
execution of juveniles as young as age 16 or adults with the
reasoning capacity of children.
   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers noted that the court last
year threw out the death sentence of an Oklahoman who murdered at
age 15, and said the rulings together provided a clear age
delineation for prosecutors and lawmakers considering capital
punishment.
   ``Lines have to be drawn somewhere,'' Bowers said on ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' program. ``I do not think the line is drawn
inappropriately.''
   Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union's
capital punishment project in New York, however, called the decision
``barbaric and medieval.''
   ``If you were to open up the paper tomorrow and read that the
French government or the British or some other civilized nation were
holding 30 kids that were going to be executed, you'd think, `Good
God, wrong dateline. They mean Iraq or Bangladesh,'' Schwarzschild
said.
   Of the 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows in the United
States, at least 32 committed their crimes under age 18.
   At least 11 states have one or more inmates under a death penalty
for crimes committed before they were 18, according to state
officials. Texas topped the list with nine, followed by Alabama and
Georgia with four each.
   Mike Hoey, a lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Conference, said
the ruling probably will make it more difficult to persuade state
lawmakers to pass a measure setting 18 as the minimum age at which
murderers can be subjected to capital punishment.
   Hoey, who unsuccessfully pushed such a measure during the 1989
session, said many lawmakers think it's ``political suicide'' to
vote against the death penalty, although voters who support capital
punishment might be more lenient toward teen-agers.
   ``Adolescents don't think out the consequences of their acts,''
Hoey said. ``It's an emotional, turbulent time of their lives.
Although they can do adult acts, they don't think like adults.''
   The high court's ruling upheld death sentences for Kevin
Stanford, who was 17 when he abducted and murdered a gas station
attendant in 1981, and Heath Wilkins, 16 when he stabbed a Kansas
City, Mo., area liquor store clerk to death in 1985.
   Wilkins' crime was especially gruesome. He stabbed Nancy Allen, a
26-year-old mother of two, in the back and chest, and stabbed her
four times in the throat after she pleaded for mercy.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster said arguments that the
ruling would lead to large-scale executions of minors was
``hogwash.''
   ``There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door.
That's ludicrous,'' said Webster.
   Webster said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty,
he or she has to be certified as an adult, go through a battery of
mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating
circumstance by the judge.
   William L. Touchette, the attorney for Paula Cooper, said the
ruling probably will not affect her case. She was 15 when she
stabbed a retired Gary, Ind., Bible teacher to death. Her case has
drawn international attention and a call for clemency from Pope John
Paul II.
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said convicted murderers have a
right to demand that sentencing juries and judges consider mental
retardation as a possible mitigating factor.
   Arguments on cruel and unusual punishment have been raised in two
pending California cases with mentally impaired defendants, said
Deputy Attorney General Dane Gillette in San Francisco.
   In one case, James Richard Odle of Pinole was sentenced to death
for the 1980 slaying of a woman and the killing of a policeman three
days later.
   Defense lawyers have cited the brain damage Odle suffered in a
1973 auto accident and a later lobotomy operation that removed a
portion of his brain. In the second case, Melvin Meffrey Wade, a
mentally disturbed San Bernardino man, was condemned for the torture
murder of his 10-year-old stepdaughter in 1981.

<HEAD>The State Department Wants To Talk to Willie Star</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Star quotes and edits throughout.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Willie Star, the State Department wants to talk
to you.
   T.W. ``Willie'' Star is listed as the ambassador to the United
States from Nauru, a tiny dot in the western Pacific, and is next in
line to become dean of the diplomatic corps in Washington. That is,
if he's still the ambassador and if he returns to the United States.
   Star presented his credentials to President Carter on June 6,
1980, and then vanished. For a long time, he doubled as Nauru's
ambassador to Australia and was living in Melbourne.
   But while the State Department couldn't find Star, he was quietly
going about his business as the consul-general in Guam, about 1,000
miles northwest of Nauru.
   Star, reached by telephone from Hawaii, said he has been Nauru's
consul-general there for about a year and seemed puzzled that the
State Department was looking for him.
   ``I have to talk to my government,'' he said today, in response
to questions.
   But Star wasn't sure about his diplomatic status in the United
States. Asked if he is still Nauru's ambassador to the United
States, he answered, ``I don't think so. I don't know. I'll have to
talk to my government,'' and refused elaboration.
   Star's presence on Guam, half a world away from Washington,
explains why he's little known in the capital city.
   ``I've never met him, but I understand he's in his 40s and that
he's been an ambassador for some time,'' said Fred Radewagen, a
part-time consultant for the government of Nauru. ``I'm told that
he's articulate, gregarious and quite intelligent.''
   The State Department's manhunt began shortly after the retirement
last month of Swedish Ambassador Wilhelm Wachtmeister, who was dean
of the diplomatic corps for three years.
   Under the rules of protocol, the largely ceremonial post goes to
the foreign ambassador with the most seniority, based on the date
when the envoy's credentials were presented to the U.S. president.
To be eligible, an ambassador must maintain an official residence
here.
   That ruled out the diplomatic representative from Western Samoa,
who was next in line but doesn't live in Washington. Next was the
southwestern Pacific nation of Tuvalu, but its ambassador had
already been transferred elsewhere.
   Then came Cypriot Ambassador Andrew Jacovides, who had barely
succeeded to the deanship when he was summoned home for a job in the
foreign ministry. Next on the list was Turkey's Sukru Elekdag, but
he's retiring.
   So up popped the mystery name of T.W. Star, who was listed as the
only ambassador of the steaming hot island of Nauru, the third
smallest country in the world after Vatican City and Monaco and
surely on nobody's list as a vacation paradise.
   The fewer than 9,000 people who inhabit Nauru's eight square
miles of coral just south of the Equator must endure an average 82
inches of rainfall annually. They are consoled, however, by the
wealth of their phosphate mines, which produce $100 million a year
in fertilizer exports.
   Although Nauru does have swaying palm trees, Radewagen said,
``they've been digging a large part of the island and carting it
away for years, and now it's so pockmarked and barren that it looks
like the Badlands of South Dakota.''
   The State Department sent a letter to Star via the U.S.
ambassador in Australia earlier this month informing him of his
opportunity to become dean of the diplomatic corps, provided he
moves his residence to Washington. So far, Star has not replied.
   Meanwhile, several cables have been dispatched to U.S. Embassy
officials in Canberra about the matter ``but they haven't said much
of anything,'' reported one insider.
   If Star doesn't respond by the time Jacovides leaves Washington
for Cyprus in early July, they said, the job probably will be
offered to the next in line, Ambassador Jose Luis Fernandes Lopes of
Cape Verde.
   One State Department official, who spoke only on condition that
he not be identified, said he has a hunch Star completed his
Washington assignment some time ago and the Nauru government never
bothered to name a successor.
   ``He is still on the books as ambassador, but I'm not sure he
really is,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Vatican Rejects Appeal to Keep Detroit Churches Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican has turned down an appeal by 14 Roman
Catholic churches of an archdiocesan order to close by July 1, and
five parishes that had planned to defy Cardinal Edmund Szoka were
reconsidering their opposition.
   The Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Clergy rejected the 14
appeals filed in March as lacking foundation in law and fact,
archdiocese spokesman Jay Berman said Monday. The archdiocese has
announced plans to close 30 churches due to declining membership.
   ``There is a real discouragement among the people here that Rome
didn't care about the injustices that have happened,'' Sister Jolene
Van Handel said. Van Handel is coordinator of the Detroit Catholic
Pastoral Alliance, a coalition of priests and laypeople opposed to
Szoka's plan.
   Nine parishes had said they would remain open, but some
opposition eroded after a series of private weekend meetings between
priests and Szoka, who ordered the closings in January after two
committees made up of church and civic leaders recommended the plan.
   Two parishes that had planned to defy the cardinal said they now
expect to accept the order, and close by Friday. The pastor of a
third congregation urged his parishioners to drop their opposition.
   Another pastor said Monday he will try to convince his members to
close and a fifth parish said it now was undecided.
   Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James Hathaway is scheduled to
consider a request by 18 parishes for an injunction against the
closings at a hearing Wednesday.

<HEAD>Former Housekeeper Says Hurt Ordered Records Shredded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor William Hurt became worried that his house
was bugged when he learned his former live-in lover was suing him,
and ordered his housekeeper to shred financial records, the former
employee testified.
   ``He told me I had to take the financial records and quietly
destroy them,'' Dianna Schiebel said Monday on the fifth day of a
trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law marriage with
dancer Sandra Jennings, the 32-year-old mother of Hurt's son.
   Jennings is suing Hurt for divorce, claiming that a common-law
marriage exists between them, based on four weeks the couple spent
in Beaufort, S.C., where he was filming ``The Big Chill.'' She says
the marriage began Dec. 9, 1982, when the actor learned he was
divorced from actress Mary Beth Hurt. He and Jennings left the state
Jan. 10, 1983.
   Hurt and Jennings were together about three years, spending most
of the time in New York, which does not permit common-law marriages.
   Schiebel said she met Hurt in May 1987 when he hired her
housekeeping firm. She said he often called Jennings and their son,
Alexander Devon Hurt, now 6, ``my family.''
   Schiebel, who eventually became Hurt's personal assistant, said
Hurt became worried that his house was bugged when he learned
Jennings was going to sue him.
   ``He started looking for a company to sweep the house for bugs,''
she said.
   She said Hurt told her: ``We have to be very careful from now on
in everything we say and do because Sandy will be looking for
information that could hurt me.''
   Schiebel said she put the financial records through Hurt's
personal shredder after she was asked to destroy them.
   Schiebel said Hurt told her he was afraid he could lose
everything.
   Hurt, at the defense table, lowered his head and ran his fingers
through his hair during the testimony. Jennings sat with her back to
him and stared at the witness.
   In another development in the state court case, a professor at
the University of South Carolina Law School hired by Hurt testified
Monday that Hurt and Jennings did not meet that state's requirements
for a common-law marriage.
   Randall Chastaine testified that common-law marriage is defined
under South Carolina civil statutes as an agreement at a specific
time between a man and a woman that they are married.
   Earlier Monday, Scott Graber, a lawyer from Port Royal, S.C.,
said Hurt and Jennings came to his Beaufort office in late December
1982, and signed what he considered to be a premarital agreement.
   ``I remember being impressed by the detail and its length,''
Graber testified.
   Hurt previously testified that he did not recall ever signing any
documents in South Carolina and that he never referred to his lover
as his wife.
   Jennings wants up to half of everything Hurt has earned for the
past 6{ years. Her attorney says Hurt, who starred in ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman,'' ``Gorky Park,'' and ``Body Heat,'' has assets of
about $10 million.

<HEAD>Two Palestinian Prisoners Reported Killed as Collaborators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian inmate at Israel's desert prison
camp killed two fellow Arabs, and Israel radio said the attacker was
retaliating for the prisoners' alleged collaboration with Israel.
   The killings, discovered today during the morning prisoner count,
raised to four the number of prisoners slain in the last two weeks
at the Ketziot prison in the Negev Desert.
   In Jersualem, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
the Israeli leader planned to hold the first meeting on his peace
plan in July with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner denied reports in the Israeli media
that Shamir will meet with supporters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which has rejected the plan.
   In its report on the overnight prison slayings, Israel radio said
the killer attacked the two victims because he suspected them of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The army confirmed the deaths, but said police were still
investigating the reason for the murders. An army spokesman
identified the victims as Mahmoud Abdul Abedgalla and Ali Hijazi
Taaf, both of the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The spokesman, who may not be identified under military
regulations, said a fellow inmate was arrested and confessed to the
murders. He gave no details on how or exactly why the men were
murdered.
   Last week at the prison, a 23-year-old Palestinian carried the
body of Mohammed Faraj Abu Jadalla out of a tent, threw it in front
of a guard and said he strangled Jadalla because the man
collaborated with Israeli authorities, the news agency Itim said.
   Earlier in the week, another Palestinian, 19-year-old Samir
Mohammed Antiz was found dead in his tent.
   Israel radio said Antiz apparently was killed by fellow prisoners
who accused him of collaborating with the Israeli authorities.
   Also today, a 17-year-old Palestinian died of wounds sustained in
a clash with troops on Saturday, Arab hospital officials and the
army said. The victim, identified as Tarek Salih Awad, was wounded
during a confrontation in the West Bank village of Idna.
   The three deaths today raised to 539 the Palestinian death toll
in the 1{-year-old uprising against Israeli rule. Seventy of the
victims have been killed by fellow Arabs as collaborators.
Twenty-three Israelis also have been slain.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops opened fire on a group of Palestinian
stone-throwers today and wounded 13 people, including four
11-year-olds, Arab hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman said the military was investigating the
incident.
   Also today, Israel radio quoted police as saying that ballistics
tests showed a 20-year-old Bedouin shepherd fatally wounded Friday
was shot by one of seven Jewish settlers held in connection with a
settler raid on a West Bank village.
   Police did not release the name of the accused, the radio said.
   The Haaretz newspaper published a poll showing Israelis are
almost evenly divided on whether settler vigilante raids in reaction
to Arab stone-throwing attacks are justified.
   The poll, conducted by the Tel Aviv-based PORI Institute, said
44.3 percent of the 1,200 Israelis questioned found the attacks
justified and 44.6 percent did not.
   Seven percent said raids should depend on the circumstances, and
4 percent gave no answer. No margin of error for the poll was given.
   In his comments, Pazner said Shamir would begin meetings with
Palestinian leaders from both the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
in July. Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East War
from neighboring Arab states.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in the
occupied territories. The PLO and most Palestinian leaders instead
support an independent Palestinian state.
   ``There will be no PLO supporters,'' Pazner said when asked about
news reports that such people would be included. He said Palestinian
leaders have agreed to attend, but he would not reveal their names.

<TEXT>
   A smouldering controversy among Bible scholars
has burst into the open over the long delay in publishing the rest
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
   Although the first-century manuscripts were found 42 years ago,
fewer than half has been published, and some researchers in ancient
religious history say they're fed up with waiting.
   ``It's disgraceful,'' said historian Morton Smith of Columbia
University, charging that the scrolls editors have ``sat on the
material for years,'' keeping it from other scholars and the public.
   The scrolls contain portions of the Old Testament far older than
any previously available. It also contains documents about Jewish
life during the early days of Christianity.
   Much of the material has remained only in the hands of a small
team of scholars deciphering it.
   David Noel Freedman, professor of biblical studies at the
University of Michigan, said 40 years is ``much too long to keep the
material from public scrutiny.''
   Only the scroll scholars ``and their friends know what is going
on,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``They've kept that work in
the dark and a whole generation has gone by. It's long past time for
some changes.''
   Smith said the inaccessbility has caused him to postpone
research. ``I've just been disgusted,'' he said.
   ``This is an important body of material for understanding both
intellectual and religious history,'' he said. ``For it to be kept
secret from other scholars and general knowledge, I think is simply
outrageous.''
   Renewed complaints about the matter were published in the current
issue of the bimonthly, Biblical Archaeology Review, which headlined
an editorial, ``Dead Sea Scrolls Scandal.''
   Harvard University's John Strugnell, who heads the scroll team of
about 20 scholars, said critics are unaware of the complexities of
the work. He also said the work is being speeded up.
   ``They are ignorant of a project like this,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Jerusalem. ``They don't know the kind of
material we're working with. We must deal always with small
fragments that must be put together.''
   He acknowledged the work had gone too slowly for the first 20
years, mainly because of a lack of financing. Only three volumes of
scrolls were put out during that period, but nine volumes have been
produced since l976.
   ``We are producing,'' he said. ``It's slow business. But we're
getting faster. An immense amount of work is being done.''
   Freedman, editor of a 30-volume Anchor series being publish by
Doubleday on books of the Bible, said that within a year or two
after such manuscripts are found, photographic slides should be
available to any scholar.
   ``For a single person to retain access to these materials is
simply unacceptable,'' he said.
   The scrolls contain portions of every book of the Old Testament
and are about 1,000 years older than any previously available
biblical manuscripts, including the complete book of Isaiah and much
of Lamentations.
   There also are documents of the Qumron community of ascetics
known as the Essenes, including a still unpublished, much-awaited
letter from the head of the community, the Teacher of Righteousness,
to Jerusalem's high priest.
   ``We hope to have that out by the end of the year,'' Strugnell
said. ``That's a top priority.''
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Department of Antiquities under which the
work is being done, said it has set up a timetable in which the
scholars had agreed to publish all of their materials by 1996.
   Amir Drori, head of the department, said the scholars had been
urged to share the workload with other researchers.
   If ``someone does not complete his work on time, we have the
right to deliver the scrolls to someone else,'' Drori said.
   The team of which Strugnell is a part began their work about
1954. He said that intitially there was insufficient funding
available for it, but he has found donors to fill that gap.
   ``For the last five or six years, we've been trying to get
additional scholars on the project,'' he said. ``That should
acclerate it.''

   The convictions of three of New Jersey's most
powerful mafia members in a plot to kill reputed New York godfather
John Gotti and his brother are a major setback for the mob,
prosecutors said.
   ``We have a hope of making organized crime a historic relic
rather than something that preys on people in the community year in
and year out,'' assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said Monday.
   A federal jury Monday convicted Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna of
Jersey City, the reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader of the
Genovese crime family; restaurateur Martin ``Motts'' Casella; and
enforcer Richard ``Bocci'' DeSciscio of plotting to kill Gotti, the
flamboyant reputed boss of the rival Gambino family, and his brother
Gene.
   They also were found guilty of arranging the 1987 New York
restaurant murder of Irwin Schiff, a 350-pound, mob-linked
businessman.
   Also convicted of racketeering conspiracy were the group's arms
supplier, former Hoboken police Lt. Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello and
laborer's union official Rocco J. Napoli. John Derrico, 27, of
Hoboken, a cook at Casella's restaurant, was acquitted on all counts
but a gambling charge.
   The jury returned the verdict on the morning of its fifth day of
deliberations after a 3{-month trial.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the convictions were
particularly damaging because the Genovese family dominated Mafia
activity in northern New Jersey.
   ``Any organization that can plot to kill John and Gene Gotti from
the rival Gambino crime family is obviously a very powerful force,''
said Alito. Manna's faction has operated since the 1950s with
``virtual impunity,'' he said.
   The FBI tipped Gotti to the plot. He was targeted in a power
struggle, authorities said.
   The government has said Schiff may have been killed because he
threatened to expose Genovese activity or because he could no longer
be trusted with a $25 million-$40 million mob money-laundering
operation.
   The defendants barely reacted to the verdict announcements.
DeSciscio blinked and looked away as his wife Ellen sobbed.
   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry ordered that all the
defendants except Derrico be held until sentencing.
   Manna, Casella and DeSciscio face up to 65 years in prison,
Napoli 75 or more, Daniello 40 and Derrico five.
   David Ruhnke, DeSciscio's attorney, said the verdict left him
``extremely disappointed.''
   ``I can understand the jury believing people were involved in
gambling,'' Ruhnke said. ``It's very difficult to believe my client
was involved in murder.''

<HEAD>Vote to Split Venice In Two Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venetians have decided to stay together,
defeating a referendum that called for divorcing the romantic lagoon
city from a dependent, blue-collar suburb on the mainland.
   The referendum, with balloting on Sunday and Monday, was pressed
for by officials in Mestre, a community that is administratively
part of the city across the causeway but has little in common with
the fabled place of singing gondoliers and smelly canals.
   Mestre politicians say the growing community's needs are
different from those of aging, tourist-choked Venice and that
Mestre's identity is overwhelmed by Venice's fame.
   While citizens of Mestre outnumber the citizens of historic
Venice, 3-1, the measure nevertheless went down to defeat, 58
percent against separation, 42 percent in favor.
   Lacking affordable housing, young Venetians have been steadily
moving out of the lagoon city to Mestre.
   In 1951, historic Venice had 175,000 people while Mestre had
about 50,000.
   In 1987, Venice's population stood at 83,000 while Mestre has
250,000.
   With souvenir stores far outnumbering butcher and grocery shops,
remaining Venetians depend greatly on Mestre for shopping.
   Ten years ago, a group of influential Venetians lobbied for a
similar referendum. That proposal was defeated with more than 72
percent of the voters opposed to separation.

<HEAD>Cambridge Tightens Animal Experimentation Regulations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rules for humane treatment of laboratory
animals adopted by this city will serve as a rallying point for
protection campaigns elsewhere, says an animal rights activist.
   The ordinance, adopted unanimously Monday evening by the
Cambridge City Council, will affect vertebrates used in studies at
Harvard University, Massachusetts Institution of Technology and 11
other academic institutes and private research firms.
   The council put teeth in the guidelines by creating a
commissioner's post to oversee and enforce the regulations.
   ``A gaping loophole in the federal law is now closed,'' Gul Agha,
who initiated the legislation three years ago when he was a
researcher at MIT, said after the vote.
   Agha, who teaches computer science at Yale University, said that
as a researcher he saw lab animals subjected to insufficient
ventilation, physicial abuse, rusted cages and starvation.
   Agha estimated that animal research is a $100 million-a-year
business in Cambridge, and said about 60,000 animals annually are
the subject of experiments.
   The vote Monday marked the first time a local jurisdiction has
ordered such far-reaching regulations on animal experimentation,
according to the Cambridge Committee for Responsible Research Inc.
   Grassroots groups have begun organizing campaigns for similar
measures in Amherst, Mass., San Francisco and Berkeley, Calif., Agha
said.
   Researchers in general have not fought the ordinance, maintaining
that they already comply with state and federal regulations.
   ``Cambridge institutions are now carrying out high quality animal
care,'' said Dr. John Moses, chairman of the animal care committee
at MIT. ``Involvement by the city will help prevent further
misunderstandings about the nature of that care by ... increasing
public accountability.''
   The newly adopted legislation expands federal and state
regulations concerning humane treatment of laboratory animals by
including all vertebrates. A vertebrate is any animal with a
backbone or spinal column, including mammals, fish, birds and
reptiles.
   Current federal law deals with dogs, cats and monkeys and
excludes reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits, said Steven
Wise, an animal rights attorney. In 1987, the mayor named Wise along
with a physician and a veterinarian to come up with recommendations
now contained in the ordinance. The panel inspected several research
laboratories in Cambridge and found no significant animal abuse.
   The position of commissioner of laboratory animals created by the
ordinance can make unannounced visits to research sites, conduct
hearings and impose fines of $300 per day, per violation.

<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot is offering
advice as well as money, and others have contributed gifts ranging
from flowers to chicken soup to help the historic Treaty Oak recover
from a poisoning attack.
   Concerned people have lent moral support by leaving the tree
get-well messages, bunches of flowers and rock crystals, which some
believe have healing powers. Monday, a votive candle and a can of
cream of chicken soup were among the offerings.
   Meanwhile, an officer on the case said police are taking a
``long, hard look'' at a suspect in the poisoning.
   ``We're getting there,'' said Austin Police Sgt. John Jones. He
said officers are concentrating on someone identified in telephone
tips to make sure the person is a ``legitimate suspect.''
   ``The publicity and the reward tend to bring out everyone,'' said
Jones, who is investigating the case as second-degree felony
criminal mischief.
   Velpar, a powerful herbicide, was poured around the oak's base.
   According to legend, Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas,
signed a treaty with the Indians under the tree's branches. The
Handbook of Texas, however, gives little credence to that story.
   The tree was admitted to the American Forestry Association's Hall
of Fame in 1927. The live oak is about 50 feet tall, has a 127-foot
limb spread and is 52.5 inches in diameter at chest height.
   The centuries-old live oak has been losing leaves and expending
its reserve energy to replace them.
   City forester John Giedraitis said Monday that Perot, who has
pledged funds to help the tree, told him, ``Don't worry about the
bureaucracy, let's just do it.''
   Perot has recommended using dechlorinated water to mist the
tree's foliage, Giedraitis said.
   ``What we're trying to do is lower the stress on the tree ...
When they (twigs) are cool, they're not under as much stress,'' he
said.
   James Houser, head of a task force that gathered at the oak
Monday and chairman of the Austin Urban Forestry Board, said the
experts would work to come up with a coherent plan of action.
   Task force members are from the U.S. Forest Service, North
Carolina State University, Texas A&amp;M University, University of
Texas, Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Forest Service, St.
Edwards University, American Society of Consulting Arborists, the
city and Du Pont, maker of Velpar.
   A $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the
poisoner has been offered by Du Pont, and $1,000 has been offered by
the Texas Forestry Association.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Dumps Rain in Texas; Thunderstorms Over Nation's Middle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison dumped rain today over the
Gulf Coast, causing streams to jump banks and roads to turn into
waterways. Elsewhere, thunderstorms drenched parts of the Midwest.
   Allison hit land in Texas on Monday, bringing more than 9 inches
of rain to Houston in the 12 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT. The storm
headed north at 3-4 mph, and was downgraded to a depression at 6
a.m. EDT, with winds of 35 mph.
   Some streets in West Beaumont, Texas, were under 3 feet of water,
and 2 feet of water covered a highway near Batson, Texas.
   The storm was blamed for the fatal traffic accident of a
46-year-old Port Neches man Monday evening, police said. It also was
blamed for the partial collapse of the roof at Northline Mall in
Houston and for capsizing a tugboat in Galveston Bay. No serious
injuries were reported in those incidents.
   The storm spawned two tornadoes, both in Galveston County. One
house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.
   Elsewhere, a solid band of rain and thunderstorms extended from
Illinois across much of Missouri and Kansas to the Texas panhandle
today.
   Some areas received heavy rainfall. In the Kansas City area, the
storm flooded streets and downed trees and power lines.
   In the Jacksonville, Ill., winds blew trees onto houses and cars.
Power was knocked out in half of the city. The thunderstorms moved
into northern Oklahoma today, producing winds of more than 60 mph.
   Thunderstorms also occurred over portions of southern Michigan on
Monday night. A gust of 60 mph was reported in Gaines, Mich., and
three-quarter-inch hail pelted Detroit.
   Scattered thunderstorms also occurred late Monday across the East
Coast states. A lightning bolt zapped the roof of a house in
Morgantown, W.Va., leaving a hole more than a foot in diameter,
while winds blew off a garage door in Bridgeport, W.Va.
   The high temperature in the nation Monday was 108 degrees at
Bullhead City Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over
southeast Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley; scattered showers
and thunderstorms over Florida, and from central Texas across
Oklahoma, the middle Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys and
Great Lakes region to northern New England; and widely scattered
thunderstorms over portions of the Intermountain region, the
northern Rockies and western portions of the northern Plains.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s and 70s over northern portions of the
Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and along the California coast;
over 100 degrees for the Rio Grande Valley of southwest Texas to the
desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest of the
country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 90 degrees at Phoenix, Yuma,
Ariz., and Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>FBI Reportedly Asked Gray About Philadelphia Accountant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents who met with Rep. William H. Gray
III in recent weeks questioned him about a financially troubled
accountant who had worked for the Democratic congressman, according
to a report.
   In today's editions, The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted an
unidentified source as saying that most of the specific questions
that the agents asked Gray concerned Neil B. Godick, president of
Godick &amp; Co., a Philadelphia accounting firm that filed for
bankruptcy in 1987.
   Godick has been accused of embezzlement by one of the creditors
in the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Gray's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said that Godick worked for Gray at
various times between the late 1970s and 1986 as a personal
accountant, an aide in his congressional office, and a campaign
consultant who helped prepare Federal Election Commission reports.
   Lowell would not talk about what the FBI and Gray discussed, nor
would he confirm that Godick had been mentioned in the interview.
   Gray met first with FBI agents on Memorial Day, triggering
reports that he was under investigation. The reports came while Gray
was making an eventually successful bid to become House majority
whip.
   The Justice Department has said that Gray is not the subject of
an investigation.
   Gray declined to discuss his meeting with the FBI.
   ``I have consistently attacked the leaks that have plagued this
investigation,'' Gray said in a statement released by his office.
``Indeed, I have called for the appointment of an independent
counsel to determine the source of these leaks. Therefore, it would
also be hypocritical of me to comment on the substance of The
Inquirer's story.''
   Godick refused requests for an interview by the newspaper.

<HEAD>Marine Biologists Fail To Move Dolphins To Ocean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine biologists and the Coast Guard suspended
efforts to herd two wayward dolphins out of the East River toward
open water because the dolphins showed signs of stress.
   ``The dolphins were getting very excited,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman Jeff Crawley, and the attempts to steer them down river
were not working when they were halted Monday evening.
   Biologists and government officials were to meet today to discuss
other methods to move the white-sided dolphins.
   A lone dolphin was first spotted last Tuesday by staff at
Metropolitan Hospital and students and teachers at an Upper East
Side school. On Monday, the marine biologists trying to move that
dolphin out to sea spotted a second dolphin swimming with the first.
   The Coast Guard, the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation Inc., the
National Marine Fisheries Service and the state Department of
Environmental Conservation worked to try to herd the white-sided
dolphins to open waters.
   The marine biologists tried to lure the dolphins by placing an
electronic device in the water with a high-frequency sound to
attract them. They had hoped the dolphins would follow their boat
down the East River, through New York Harbor, past the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the Atlantic Ocean.
   Sam Sadove, research director at Okeanos, said Sunday the first
dolphin appeared to be in relatively good health, although it was
making sudden changes in its swimming direction, possibly because of
impaired sonar.
   A humpback whale that strayed up the Hudson River on New York's
west side last June turned and swam back out to sea a couple of days
later when several Coast Guard boats gunned their engines, banged
pipes and sounded horns.

<TEXT>
   Dynamite exploded in a passenger compartment of a
train outside Shanghai, killing at least 24 people and seriously
injuring 11, official reports said today.
   An official of the city's Foreign Affairs Office described
Monday's blast as an accident. Western diplomats in Shanghai said
there was no indication it was linked to this month's military
suppression of the pro-democracy movement.
   The national television news showed tape of a gaping hole in the
side of the train from the explosion, which it said occurred in a
toilet at the front of a third-class compartment.
   The inside of the train was severely damaged but there was no
fire, reported the Japan's Kyodo News Service
   China's official Xinhua News Agency and government-run television
said the blast was caused by dynamite but gave no details.
   The Foreign Affairs Office official said the blast occurred on a
train bound for Shanghai from Hangzhou, about 110 miles to the
southwest.
   The official, who did not give his name, said an unknown number
of passengers suffered minor injuries and 11 were seriously hurt. He
said 24 people were killed in the blast.
   A local railroad official who identified himself only as Qi said
he was uncertain how many people were on the train. But he said the
capacity of the compartment where the blast occurred was 100 people.
   The television news showed Mayor Zhu Rongji at the crash site
investigating the damage and talking to the injured.
   Explosions on Chinese trains are not uncommon. Sometimes they are
the result of peasants carrying dynamite for their farms or
fireworks for New Year celebrations.
   Shanghai was the scene of major protests before soldiers killed
hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing in crushing the
pro-democracy movement.
   On June 6, six people were killed in Shanghai when a train
smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators.
   Three men convicted of setting fire to the train after the crash
were subsequently executed.

   Dad's Coffee Shop, where java in a
plastic cup will cost you $2, has been fined $16,000 for using
topless waitresses.
   Magistrate John E.V. Pieski on Monday cited Dad's prices as
evidence the adults-only business offers entertainment, for which it
is not zoned.
   ``These are not waitresses who as a necessary and customary
incident to the service of food are friendly. Their primary purpose
and objective is to entertain by their nakedness and by their
fraternization,'' Pieski said.
   The judge also cited Wasley's newspaper ads: ``Noon to 6 p.m. _
Topless Colleen from L.A. (38-24-34),'' read one.
   Thomas Wasley said his business, which opened Feb. 15, will
continue to use topless help while he appeals. The borough said it
probably will seek additional fines.
   ``How can you really say when a girl serves you coffee that it's
entertainment?'' Wasley asked. ``The question here is uniform. ...
Where are they going to draw the line as to what's entertainment and
what's dress?''
   Frank Siderowicz, who led a petition drive against Dad's, said he
will not be happy until the business closes.
   ``We don't want this type of business in Dickson City,'' he said.
``This is small-town America. It's bringing a bad type of people to
Dickson City.''
   About 1,100 of the borough's 6,700 residents signed a petition
circulated outside churches opposing Dad's ``or any other enterprise
of obscene nature.''
   ``It's disgusting,'' Dad's regular Joe Olszewski said of the
ruling. ``A woman giggling is not entertaining. God made them that
way.''

   Gov. Norm Bangerter says the University of
Utah's fusion experiments have gotten enough independent
confirmation for the state to release $5 million for more research.
   However, the Legislature gave control of the $5 million to a
fusion advisory committee, not the governor. Members of the
committee, who are scheduled to meet with university officials on
Thursday, have complained the university has not shared enough
details.
   Experiments at other universities have only partly duplicated the
process by which Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and British colleague
Martin Fleischmann claimed to have achieved nuclear fusion at room
temperature. Their table-top experiment, announced March 23, raised
prospects of a cheap, safe energy source but was derided by many
physicists.
   ``There's nothing in the legislation that requires it to even be
fusion or to have commercial applications,'' Bud Scruggs,
Bangerter's chief of staff, said Monday. ``The governor won't put
pressure on the committee, but he will say he thinks the legislation
is designed to kick in now.''
   Hugo Rossi, director of the university's fusion research, said he
is eager to go before the committee with a proposal for the $5
million.
   James Brophy, the university's vice president for research, said
a collaboration agreement with General Electric Co. is expected this
week.
   Pons and Fleischmann are in England working on a scientific paper
and will not be at Thursday's meeting, but Pons is expected to
attend a July 11 meeting of the panel.

   Merchants weary of panhandlers are
sending a psychotherapist into the streets to talk to the homeless

   The 244-member Downtown Merchants Association voted last week to
hire Sarah Howard to strike up conversations with street dwellers
and direct them to the appropriate agency for help.
   Gregory Borrelli, president of the association, said he started
the program to give panhandlers ``hope and dignity.''
   Hope and dignity aside, merchants have been irked by panhandlers,
fearing they are driving away business. The organization had planned
to hire a security guard to police the area but abandoned the idea
for the psychological approach.
   ``What I'm getting from the homeless people is that they don't
feel respected by the mental health community,'' said Howard. She
said she will try to ``find out what they want.''
   Howard, who has a master's degree in psychology, will supervise a
staff of volunteers who will keep tabs on the progress of homeless
people seeking help.

<HEAD>Defendant Seen Following Palme Just Before Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a hot dog stand today
testified that he saw the accused killer of Prime Minister Olof
Palme behind the Swedish leader moments before the shooting.
   The testimony was one of the most damaging to the defendant,
Christer Pettersson, since the trial began June 5. Pettersson has
denied the killing.
   Kiosk owner Ljuvica Nadik said he noticed someone walking 10 to
15 feet behind Palme and his wife, Lisbeth, down a street after they
left a movie theater on Feb. 28, 1986.
   ``I'm certain this is the man who followed them,'' said Nadik, a
Yugoslav immigrant who occasionally was helped by a translator.
   He remembered noticing that Palme had no security guards and
feeling disappointed that the couple were simply dressed.
   Asked how he could identify Pettersson with certainty, Nadik said
``the image is very vivid with me. I've been reminded so many times.
Every time I watch television or look through a newspaper and there
has been something about the Palme murder, I have seen the image of
the man who followed them,'' he said.
   A second witness, Anders Bjorkman, testified that he saw the
shooting from a distance of about 15 yards, but he could not
identify the gunman.

   Max Kowalski lived in the shadow of the swastika
at Auschwitz, where the Nazis were killing 10,000 Jews a day by
1945. His father, mother, sister and brother perished, but he
survived _ until last weekend, when the shadow reappeared on the
door of his boarding house room.
   Police say it was the work of a fellow boarder, an apparently
unbalanced man with whom Kowalski had quarreled in the past. He went
to the man's room to complain, and a fight ensued. When it was over
Kowalski, 72, was dead on the floor in a puddle of blood.
   Ruben Martinez Zucarino, 36, was charged with second degree
murder. Detectives said he stabbed the old man repeatedly with a
fork and scissors, and hit him over the head with a religious
statue. He admitted having drawn the swastika, they said.
   ``Max survived a monster,'' said Rabbi Israel Steinberg of the
state's human rights office. ``It's a shame he couldn't survive a
bite from a mosquito.''
   Kowalski, a Polish Jew, came to the United States in 1949 and
settled with many other Eastern European immigrants in the Brighton
Beach section of Brooklyn. It was a simple but balanced life, built
on rituals such as a chat with the card players under the trees in
Asser Levy Park or a stroll along the boardwalk on the ocean.
   Kowalski lived with his wife in an apartment complex, but rented
a room in a house near the beach as a combination hangout and
workshop. He was a handyman who seemed to do half his work for free.
   ``He fixed a closet in my house once, but I couldn't force the
money on him,'' said Harry Zukoff, a friend. ``He would do anything
for you. I knew him 25 years _ a beautiful man.''
   But a few months ago another room on the second floor of the
boarding house was rented by Zucarino, with whom Kowalski quarreled
over the condition of a kitchen area they shared. When Kowalski's
son Lenny went to visit his father on Saturday morning, he found a
swastika and skull and crossbones written on the door with blue ink.
   Kowalski, whose arm still bore the five-digit identification
number which the Nazis branded on him, had not noticed it, and he
quietly cleaned the markings off his door. But as his son Robert
later said, ``If somebody put a swastika up and you had numbers on
tatooed on your arm, you would be upset.''
   Kowalski's friends were struck by the irony: to survive Hitler,
the greatest villain in history, only to be killed a man whom they
described as a garden variety anti-Semite.
   Brighton Beach is still a fairly safe neighborhood, but there
have been other incidents. These immigrants, who have seen the worst
the Old World had to offer, and wonder if the new one will turn out
any better.
   ``We came here to live, not to fight with people,'' said Eva
Uszerowicz, another Auschwitz survivor with numbers on her arm.
   But eventually the conversation kept coming back to Kowalski, and
what a nice man he had been. The one thing everyone seemed to
remember was his attendance at funerals.
   For a proper Jewish funeral, a quorum of 10 men is needed _ a
minyan. Sometimes, when the deceased is particularly old or without
family, 10 men are hard to come by. But Kowalski was always ready to
drop whatever he was doing and go off to help form the minyan,
whether he knew the deceased well or not. It was a mitzvah, a good
deed.
   On Monday afternoon, at Kowalski's own funeral, there was no
problem with a minyan. About 200 people jammed into the funeral home.
   The congregation included Kowalski's landlady, Tuey Chin, who
sobbed throughout the service. In a city where landlords and tenants
fight like Hatfields and McCoys, this was no small testament to Max
Kowalski's spirit.
   During World War II, ``six million people died because they were
Jews,'' Rabbi Steven Ziskind said in Yiddish. ``Today, you died
because you're a Jew.''

<HEAD>Khashoggi Refuses Extradition to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi has
refused extradition to face U.S. charges that he helped Ferdinand
and Imelda Marcos plunder the Philippines, a Swiss Justice Ministry
official said today.
   Spokeswoman Ursula Riedel said Khashoggi was asked whether he
would accept immediate extradition, but refused.
   Swiss police arrested Khashoggi in April at the request of the
U.S. Embassy and authorities are considering a U.S. extradition
request.
   They will decide only after Khashoggi's lawyers give formal
reasons for his refusal, expected in about a week, Ms. Riedel said.
   Since Switzerland seems likely to approve extradition and
Khashoggi's lawyers would fight the decision in court, the
international financier probably will spend his 54th birthday, July
25, in a Bern jail cell.
   A U.S. District Court in New York in October indicted Khashoggi,
the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank.
   The ousted Philippines president and his wife are accused of
stealing art and more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury
to buy real estate and art objects.
   Khashoggi allegedly posed as owner of some assets.
   He is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of
justice and mail fraud. Racketeering alone carries a penalty of up
to 20 years in jail.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday.
   I have a brief opening statement, and then I'd be glad to take
questions. On Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court issued a decision
which held that a person could not be convicted for desecration of
our flag, the American flag, and because to do so would infringe
upon the right to political protest. Now, we've got to be very
careful in our society to preserve the right to protest government
action. However, I believe that the flag of the United States should
never be the object of desecration.
   Flag-burning is wrong. Protection of the flag, a unique national
symbol, will in no way limit the opportunity nor the breadth of
protest available in the exercise of free speech rights. And I have
the greatest respect for the Supreme Court, and indeed for the
justices who interpreted the Constitution as they saw fit. But I
believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a
constitutional amendment.
   Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecration of
the American flag. And we are reviewing proposed language for a
constitutional amendment. We are beginning consultation with members
of the United States Congress who hold similar views. And as
president, I will uphold our precious right to dissent, but burning
the flag goes too far, and I want to see that matter remedied.
   Tom?
   Q. Mr. President, when you were last with us, you said that you
had tried to contact the leaders of China, and the line was busy;
you were unable to get through. In light of the fact that there is
now a new party secretary, have you renewed that try? And also, in
light of what you just said, have you planned to ask Prime Minister
Li Peng to return the Texas cowboy boots with the American flag on
it that you gave him in China?
   A. I have no such plans. But _ and I hope he doesn't ask for his
bicycles back either. But in terms of contacts, we are trying,
through our embassy, to have contacts. We have contact _ their
ambassador has access to and contact with our officials here. And so
there has been some exchange of views. But I have not, you know,
renewed a phone call request, if that was your question.
   Q. As a follow-up, Mr. President, do you intend to go ahead and
send a Peace Corps team to China in the fall to teach English, or
will you go along with the Chinese request that that be delayed?

   A former fireman traveled from a retirement home
in Las Vegas for the high school graduation of a girl he hadn't seen
since he pulled her from a burning building 14 years ago.
   At Lisa Greene's invitation, Marvin Bunch, 60, watched the
17-year-old receive her diploma Monday at Thomas Jefferson High
School.
   ``I've always wanted to thank him personally and I wanted to show
him that it was really worthwhile saving my life,'' Miss Greene said.
   Bunch said he wept when he got the invitation.
   ``The recognition that Lisa gave me and the efforts of the men in
Engine Company 332 was better than any medal or award that I could
have gotten,'' he said.
   Miss Greene was pulled from a fire that destroyed her Brooklyn
home when she was 3. ``I thought about how I am here today and did
not even know who rescued me. So I decided to find out,'' she said.
   Her family contacted the Fire Department six months ago to trace
records that led to Bunch, who retired in 1979.
   Bunch on Monday recalled rushing into the burning house and
groping through smoke on the second floor.
   ``I stepped and my leg hit something soft. I reached down and I
felt someone's arm,'' he said. He brought the unconscious child out
and she was taken to a hospital, where she underwent skin grafts and
took four months to recover.
   Other firefighters brought out her sisters, Rebecca, 1, and
Trina, 2.

<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Burmese troops backed by
mortar and artillery fire today attacked Karen guerrilla positions
near the Thai border, Karen rebel sources said.
   Thai border patrol police said more than 50 mortar and artillery
shells fell into Thailand, and Burmese machine-gun fire hit three
houses and a Buddhist temple in the border village of Mae Kone Kane.
   Thai police returned the fire, the border patrol said.
   Fierce fighting began before dawn as at least 800 government
troops attacked the Karen base of Pa Loo, about eight miles south of
the Thai border town of Mae Sot, said the guerrilla sources on
condition of anonymity.
   Burmese troops pounded Pa Loo and the nearby camp at Kaw Moo Ra
with hundreds of mortar and artillery rounds, they said. Both camps
are separated from Thailand by the Moei River.
   No casualties were immediately reported.
   With about 8,000 armed fighters, the Karens are the largest of a
dozen ethnic groups that have fought for more than four decades for
greater autonomy from Rangoon.
   Since December, government forces have seized five key guerrilla
bases.
   The guerrillas claim they have killed up to 2,000 Burmese and
wounded another 4,000 in the government offensive.
   Thai military sources said that up to June 15, about 185 Burmese
troops were killed and at least 470 wounded in attacks on Pa Loo and
Kaw Moo Ra that began in May. Karen casualties have been light, they
said, with only six rebels reported dead and another 17 wounded.
   In an interview on Sunday at the Karen headquarters of Manerplaw,
rebel commmander Bo Mya said that his fighters would revert to
broader guerrilla actions against targets inside Burma following the
loss of key border positions.
   He dismissed suggestions that the rebels were near defeat, but
other Karen officials based along the Thai border said the
insurgency was at its lowest point ever.
   Bo Mya blamed recent Burmese successes on the economic boost
Rangoon received from its trade ties with Thailand. The Karens also
charged that government forces have been permitted to enter Thailand
to attack their positions from the rear.

<TEXT>
   A survey of more than 3,000 adults suggests that
if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s, most Americans missed
it.
   The survey, conducted in 1970 but published this week for the
first time, found that Americans overwhelmingly disapproved of
prostitution, extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely
opposed to homosexuality.
   ``The number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is
exaggerated, I think, just as the number of homosexuals in the
population has been exaggerated,'' one of the study's authors,
Eugene E. Levitt, a psychologist at the Indiana University School of
Medicine, said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The survey, which could help researchers understand how AIDS
spreads, was not released for so long because two of its authors
fought over whose name should appear first on the title page, said
Hubert J. O'Gorman, who edited the survey report to be published
Thursday.
   The survey's other authors were Albert D. Klassen of the
University of North Dakota and Colin Williams of Indiana
University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.
   ``This is the first major study that dealt with the morality
aspect'' of sexual behavior, said Levitt. ``And, by the way, it
shows how bitterly anti-homosexual the American people are.''
   More than two-thirds of respondents said homosexuals should not
be allowed to be judges, teachers, ministers, doctors or government
officials, Levitt said.
   The study, ``Sex and Morality in the U.S.,'' is the only survey
of sex and morality taken in a representative sample of the U.S.
population before AIDS, said Charles Turner, a sociologist and
director of the committee on AIDS research at the National Academy
of Sciences.
   ``It's unique data that cannot be reconstructed. It's of great
historical interest,'' said Turner, who had prior access to the
findings under a special arrangement with the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University.
   Among the findings:
   _Extramarital sex was described as ``always wrong'' or ``almost
always wrong'' by 87 percent of respondents.
   _Homosexual relations among people who don't love each other were
described the same way by 88 percent of the respondents. Even among
individuals who love each other, homosexual sex was disapproved of
by 79 percent of respondents.
   _Eighty-two percent disapproved of teen-age girls having
premarital sex; 73 percent disapproved of teenage boys having
premarital sex.
   _Seventy percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by women,
and 65 percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by men.
   Fewer respondents disapproved of sexual acts if the partners
loved each other, ``leaving little doubt, therefore, that many
respondents still cherished the ideal of love as a basis for sexual
behavior,'' the authors said.
   ``These data will be indispensible to any attempt to describe the
effects of AIDS on American sexual morality and behavior,'' O'Gorman
of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., said in an introduction
to the survey.
   The survey had been nearly forgotten when researchers at the
Kinsey Institute began to search their files for information that
could help explain the spread of AIDS, said June Reinisch, the
institute's director.
   ``In the course of this search, we recognized the potential value
of the unpublished 1970 survey data,'' she wrote in a preface to the
book.
   Klassen took until 1979 to prepare the findings for publication.
Williams had been called in to speed the writing. Both demanded to
be listed as the first author.
   Two years ago, Reinisch pushed a compromise in which Klassen was
listed first and Williams was designated the official spokesman for
the book.
   The data have already allowed Turner to estimate that in 1970 at
least 20 percent of adult men had had homosexual contact at some
time during their lives.
   ``We haven't had a good number for that,'' said Turner, adding
that such numbers are critical to understanding the AIDS epidemic.

<TEXT>
   Sellling communion wine to the public has gotten a
bookstore owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in trouble with
state liquor agents.
   A Liquor Control Commission investigator seized a case of
sacramental wine after the Detroit Catholic Bookstore sold it to him
Friday, manager Dennis Klotz said.
   ``I was kind of shocked by the whole thing,'' Klotz said. ``I was
not out to break the law. ... It's not like I was selling it out the
back door.''
   The manager said he began selling 11 varieties of wine to the
public in May and was unaware his wholesale liquor license was
insufficient to do it.
   Commission spokesman Elwood Webb said the case could lead to
penalties ranging from a warning to revocation of the store's
wholesale liquor license.
   A hearing will be held within six months, Webb said.

   President Bush said today he would keep trying
to get in touch with the leaders of China but acknowledged he had
not been able to make contact in the last few weeks.
   Bush, at a White House news conference, said he had still not
received a telephone call from Beijing despite his efforts to
discuss the recent turmoil in the world's most populous nation.
   But Bush said there have been ``some exchange of views'' at a
lower level, And he stressed that the Chinese ambassador here, Han
Xu, has had easy access to senior U.S. officials.
   Bush first disclosed his inability to make contact at a news
conference last week. He appealed publicly for a show of clemency,
but executions proceeded.
   In his remarks, Bush was mildly critical of moves by the Chinese
to suspend Peace Corps visits to the country.
   ``That's too bad,'' he said, ``One of the things that moved
reform is contacts with Americans. I don't want to see those
contacts cut off.''
   Bush again avoided any heavy denunciation of the arrests and
executions in China. ``I reiterate my desire not to do damage to the
people themselves.''
   He said U.S. contacts with China had promoted economic reform in
the country. ``Someday we will move the process of political reform
forward,'' he said.
   In the meantime, he said 30,000 Chinese now studying here will be
``going back there with a sense of what democracy and freedom is all
about.''
   He said U.S. ties had helped China move out of a period of
cultural isolation and that ``this relationship is important.''
   Repeatedly, Bush said good relations with Beijing are in the U.S.
interest. But he did not respond to two questions asking him to give
specific examples.
   ``At this moment,'' Bush said, ``it's impossible to have normal
relations for very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level
best to find a way to see improvement there.''
   And yet, the president said he could not ``dictate'' to the
Chinese who should be leading the country.
   Since Army troops fired on students June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square
the leadership of the government and the Communist party has been
revised to remove leaders who showed some sympathy for democratic
reform movements.
   Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing and claims
expertise in Chinese affairs, said he could not have predicted the
recent turn of events.
   But, he said, ``I guess the lesson is to go forward as best you
can'' and ``to hold high the banner of values you believe in.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a speech Monday night
in New York, was optimistic about long-term prospects for democracy.
   ``In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape,'' Baker
said in a speech summarizing Bush Administration policy on Asia.
``While the rites of passage will be painful _ China proves that _
it is an order full of promise and hope.''
   ``We and some other nations have suspended business as usual,''
Baker said. ``But we and the rest of the world must not let our
revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform.''
   Baker spoke for 25 minutes before 1,000 guests at a black-tie
dinner of the Asia Society, a private group dedicated to improving
American understanding of Asia.
   He outlined a proposal for a new association of Asian countries
to increase trade and investment and handle other regional issues
ranging from cultural affairs to the environment.
   Baker said he plans to seek input on the form such an
organization might take during a trip to Asia that starts July 3.
   Baker will stop in Tokyo to help plan multinational economic aid
for the Philippines. In Brunei, he will attend the annual meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, an economic organization
of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
   Japan's new foreign minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who met with
Bush earlier Monday, spoke at the dinner before Baker.
   He stressed the need for America ``to maintain a strong
political, economic and military presence and commitment to the
region.''
   Mitsuzuka also called China's ``path toward isolation''
regrettable and appealed to China's leaders to ``govern in a spirit
of reconciliation and restraint.''
   Meanwhile, 11 Americans were detained Monday by Chinese officials
in Kunming and charged with distributing religious tracts, said Adam
Shub, a State Department spokesman.
   The Americans were believed to be members of an evangelical
Christian group, the Latter Rain Ministry of Litchfield, Ill.
   A U.S. diplomat from the American consulate in Chengdu was
investigating.
   In the past, Americans who distributed religious tracts have been
fined and asked to leave.

   A. John, something might be happening in some department today
that I know nothing about. We've got an enormous bureaucracy. We've
got a tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world. And
there might well be some corruption out there that's going on that I
would be responsible for, but that I don't know about. But I am not
going to try to assign blame; I want to look to the future. And
that's the way I'm going to handle that one.
   Yeah, Lesley?
   Q. Mr. President, you've spoken out emotionally, obviously, about
the Supreme Court's decision on the flag. I wonder if you'd like to
take this chance to speak out emotionally on their affirmative
action decisions, which make it harder for women and minorities to
sue for discrimination?
   A. I'm not sure that I agree with your _ the hypothesis of your
question. As I said at a _ the last press conference, formal press
conference _ I was going to ask our attorney general and our general
counsel to look into this matter. And I am strongly committed to
equal opportunity for all Americans. And I am advised that nothing
in these decisions jeopardizes that principle or calls into question
affirmative action or minority outreach efforts. This was _ this is
the opinion of the attorney general, who, I understand, will be
speaking on this at noon today.
   The Justice Department has told me that the decision reflects
interpretation of the civil rights laws by the court on technical
subjects, and we're talking about burdens of proof and statutes of
limitations. But, that is the advice I am getting, and I will
certainly support the attorney general.
   Q. All right. Constitutional scholars say, for instance, that if
a minority student is _ faces racial harassment at school, at
private schools _ they are no longer covered. There are some
situations where people cannot sue for racial harassment, for
instance, and there are other sort of niggling things, but it's
really the question of your emotional response, because you jump out
of the box on the flag.
   A. I have just given it to you. Affirmative action I've _ you
know my position on that: commitment to equal opportunity. I hope
people know my commitment on that, but we're getting into a
technicality that neither you or I are competent to discuss. And I
am going _ you are going on the advice of who you call ``legal
scholars,'' and I'm going on the advice of the attorney general and
a very fine general counsel. So, I think we have a difference on the
interpretation of what this means, and I've seen that some of the
civil rights leaders disagree. But, I am committed, and if the
decisions actually turn out to hamper civil rights enforcement,
along the lines you're talking about, obviously I would want to take
steps to remedy the situation.
   Q. But are you saying you won't support legislation...
   A. Is this your third question. Come on, Lesley.
   Q. I'm sorry.
   A. Go ahead.
   Q. Are you saying you won't support legislation that...
   A. I'm saying that my advice from the attorney general is that
legislation isn't necessary.
   Back here in the middle. Yeah.
   Q. Mr. President, you've expressed your strong feelings again on
this Supreme Court decision on the flag burning, but the Supreme
Court is expected to make a decision this week on the abortion
issue, which is among the most emotional in the country. And I
wonder, going into that decision, if you view your role as a healer
after this decision, as simply to enforce the law? What is your
view, going into that decision as the president, and this very
important emotional issue?
   A. It is an emotional issue. And I am firmly positioned in favor
of, you know, overturn of Roe-Wade. And that's my position, and I'm
not going to change that position. But I don't want to see it _ the
divisiveness that that whole issue causes _ split this country. And
yet the decision is going to be _ I don't know what they're going to
decide. But my position on it is very clear.
   Owen.
   Q. During the campaign, you came out many times for a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I'm curious why now
you've moved so quickly to call for a constitutional amendment
concerning flag-burning, which is solely a symbolic issue, and yet
you haven't moved at all on balancing the budget in terms of a
constitutional amendment, which is substantive and which a lot of
people in this country think would accomplish a lot more for the
economy. Can you explain that?
   A. Yeah _ oh, easily. Let me take this opportunity to make a
clarion call for a balanced budget amendment. Absolutely. It has to
be phased in, but I'd like to see it.
   Q. Why do you have to be prompted to do that? Why do you give
such a high priority...
   A. Because my position is so well-known on it, Owen.
   Q. Why do you give such a high priority to the issue of
flag-burning, and you haven't said anything until now about a
balanced budget amendment?
   A. I said a lot about it all last year. I thought you got tired
of hearing it. But I will repeat it. And _ but if you want to know,
I've got to confess, I do feel viscerally about burning the American
flag. And I don't _ and therefore, I express it. And I feel
viscerally about fiscal sanity, also. But this decision just came
down and it is one that causes, I think, the American people, and
certainly this president, great concern. And I think it can be
remedied without doing violence to a person's right to protest.
   Yeah, David, and then Charles.
   Q. Mr. President, you're going to Poland in a few weeks, and I
wonder, a lot's happened since your Hamtramck speech; we've had free
elections, Solidarity now may have a much bigger role in what
happens in Poland. When you go, are you interested in bringing some
expanded debt relief, financial aid? Walesa has been saying to the
world that he really needs help now. Do you think you are in a
position to bring it?

   President Bush today said the Soviet Union
knows ``we want to move forward'' on a nuclear weapons reduction
treaty and applauded Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for visiting
Western Europe.
   The president spoke to reporters a day after five former
secretaries of state and defense urged the administration to push
for the treaty but warned that the United States does not know
enough about Kremlin intentions ``to justify extraordinary political
or economic concessions.''
   Bush said he had no timetable for a first summit meeting with
Gorbachev but said such a meeting did not need to wait for a major
treaty agreement between the superpowers.
   ``I don't think it should be something to sign, but I'd like to
think that the governing criterion would be that the world would see
the meeting as successful, something good coming out of it,'' Bush
said.
   Bush, speaking in general terms about arms negotiations with the
Soviets, said ``they know we want to move forward with START,'' an
acronym for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.
   ``I feel comfortable,'' about the pace of improvements in
U.S-Soviet ties, Bush said, adding that a number of medical and
cultural exchanges had helped improve the relationship.
   ``We're coming closer on some of these broad, broad-scale
objectives,'' Bush said. ``All I want to say is I think the
relationship is going in the right general direction albeit we have
tremendous differences with the Soviet Union still.''
   Bush applauded Gorbachev's recent visits to West Germany and
England and said he did not expect the Kremlin ``to be uptight''
about his upcoming visit to Poland, a Warsaw Pact ally of the
Soviets.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev goes to Western Europe and he is well received; I
will go to Eastern Europe and I will be well received,'' Bush said.
   The report released Monday and signed by the five secretaries and
six other ex-officials also counseled Bush to show restraint on
developing space-based defenses.
   It concluded that Gorbachev is more inclined than any of his
predecessors to reach accords with the United States that further
Western interests.
   But it added that U.S. knowledge of current and future Kremlin
policy was ``too problematical to justify extraordinary political or
economic concessions which we would otherwise not consider.''
   James Schlesinger, secretary of defense in the Nixon
administration, criticized the Soviet leader for agreeing last week
to resume arms aid to Iran. He said it showed Gorbachev is still
seeking ``marginal advantage'' over the West and in that respect
``failing the test.''
   Still, the report urged the administration to push hard to
complete the treaty to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines by 30 to 50 percent. After a seven-month recess, the Bush
administration resumed negotiations last week in Geneva.
   At the same time, the United States and its NATO allies are
negotiating with the Warsaw Pact in Vienna to reduce troops, tanks,
artillery and other non-nuclear armories in Europe.
   The report said completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty
``will make it easier for the United States and its allies to obtain
large and asymmetrical reductions in conventional arms, and should
not wait on success in the latter.''
   Gorbachev already has made ``especially significant'' commitments
to cut more men and arms than the West and to shift the role of
Soviet troops toward defense, the report said.
   ``I do worry,'' said Harold Brown, who was secretary of defense
in the Carter administration, ``if START is pushed to the back
burner it will not get done at all. That would be a big mistake.''
   Schlesinger and Brown, who held a joint news conference, were
joined in the report by former Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird and
former Secretaries of State Cyrus R. Vance and Edmund S. Muskie.
   The other ex-officials who issued the report were David Abshire,
Michael Blumenthal, Arthur H. Hartman, Richard Helms, Peter Peterson
and Thomas Watson.
   On space-based defenses, they said the United States should be
willing to recommit itself for 10 years to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty and discuss with the Soviets what kind of tests for a
space-based defense are permitted.
   This could have the effect of constraining the program undertaken
by former President Reagan to develop a shield against Soviet
ballistic missiles combining sophisticated technology and nuclear
weapons in space.
   However, the report also suggested the 1972 treaty could be
amended or a new one concluded with the Soviets through negotiations.

   Here is an at-a-glance look at President Bush's
news conference Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FLAG-BURNING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush called for a constitutional amendment to prohibit
desecration of the flag, saying support of the First Amendment need
not extend to activities that would deface ``the unique symbol of
America.''
   He said it was important to protect free speech, but that
protecting the flag would in ``no way limit'' constitutional rights.
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last week that burning the American flag
as a form of protest is protected by the Constitution.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POLAND</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The president said he would carry a package of economic aid for
Poland when he travels to Eastern Europe next month, but first wants
to make sure that Poland's Communist government implements reforms.
   He said Soviet leaders should not be ``uptight'' about his
presence in Eastern Europe, saying he didn't expect his stops in
Poland and Hungary to be disruptive to the communist world.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHINA</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   ``I'm going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement
there that will help the Chinese people,'' Bush said, also again
declaring that he doesn't want to see contacts with the Chinese
government cut off despite the continuing crackdown on dissidents.
   Contacts with the West ``hopefully someday will move the process
of political reform forward,'' Bush said.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HUD</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush decried ``cronyism'' in the Department of Housing and Urban
Development as investigators look into alleged irregularities in
housing programs in several states and congressional committees
probe the department's operation.
   Expressing confidence in HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Bush vowed to
get to the bottom of scandals plaguing the department under the
Reagan administration.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush said his advisers have concluded that none of the recent
Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action jeopardizes the
principles of equal opportunity for all Americans. Civil rights
advocates say several recent decisions undercut progress toward
equal rights.
   The president said, however, if the court's decisions turn out to
hamper civil rights enforcement, he would consider legislation.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ABORTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   With the Supreme Court expected to rule later this week on a case
involving abortion, Bush renewed his opposition to the procedure.
The president said he was not going to change his position.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHILD CARE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush criticized legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled
Senate on child care, saying it ``does not fit what I think is the
proper prescription for child care.'' But Bush said he would wait to
see the final bill before deciding what steps to take.

<HEAD>Two Bomb Squad Officers Injured In Explosion, Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An explosion and fire ripped through a
building today, injuring at least two bomb-squad officers
investigating a fireworks blast that tore off part of a youth's hand
hours earlier, authorities said.
   Officers with burns and facial cuts were taken to two hospitals,
where their conditions were not available, said Firefighter Jim
Williamson.
   ``It's too confusing right now to tell just how many were
injured,'' he said. ``It's anywhere from two to seven, and we think
they're all officers.''
   About 35 firefighters put out the blaze at a Victorian structure
described as either a single-family house or small apartment
building, he said.
   The youth injured by fireworks was treated at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, police said. The victim's condition was not
available.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: bring it?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Yes, I'm in a position to discuss it. Inasmuch as some of what
I want to do will require legislation, that will not be _ have been
completed. But I called Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman of the Finance
Committee, to thank him over the weekend for his stance in the
Finance Committee in terms of support for Poland. And so we will
have a package that I'm not prepared to discuss now in detail, that
I hope will help. I know this will be a subject of great concern
after my Polish _ the visit to Poland in the _ in our summit,
economic summit meeting.
   But the problem is, we would like very much to help Poland. I am
very encouraged with what's happened in Poland. But I want to be
sure that when we do offer the specifics and the specific plan to
help Poland, that Poland itself takes, will have taken, the steps
necessary to have the money well spent. I don't want to just push
money down, down the drain. So I think along with what we can offer
there will have to come from their side some reforms. And that, I
want to talk to General Jaruzelski about, and obviously Lech Walesa,
and we'll see where we go.
   Charles, and then John here.
   Q. Let me follow on the Poland question. Both there and in
Hungary, you're entering countries that are in a transition at a
very delicate situation politically, and vis-a-vis their own allies.
What cautions do you take and do you exercise going in there so as
not to be a negative catalyst?
   A. I think being there is the significant thing. It is important
that the United States show its interest in these countries that are
undergoing change. You don't want to over-exhort. You don't want to
over-promise. You don't want to rally people to levels of political
activity that might cause repression. And so what I want to do is
make clear where the United States stands in terms of our respect
for freedom, encourage reform as much as possible, and then _ back
to David's question _ offer some specifics where we can help on the
economy. Our _ my views on differentiation have not changed over the
last few years. We will differentiate. We will support those that
move towards us economically, politically and in terms of human
rights. And it's more on those general themes that I will be talking
to the Hungarian leaders and the Polish leaders.
   Q. If I could follow.
   A. Yes.
   Q. Do you send any signal at the same time to the Soviet Union?
Or have you had any communication to them about the purposes of your
visit?
   A. No, but I would not expect them to be uptight about it. Mr.
Gorbachev goes to Western Europe and is well-received. And I will go
to Eastern Europe and I will be well-received. And I think it was a
good thing, his trip to Germany. I've talked to Chancellor Kohl
about it personally. And I don't get all into some state of
competition when I see Mr. Gorbachev get a good, warm response in
Germany. The NATO Alliance is together.
   One of the things that came out of the Brussels NATO summit
meeting was the fact that there is strong unity there. And so it's a
good thing for him to go to Western Europe, and it's a good thing
for the president of the United States to go to Eastern Europe. And
I want to see us move beyond containment. I want to see a much more
open Europe. And I think that this _ so the importance of the visit
is along that line. And it's not going to be that we're going to
solve the problem of the Hungarian economy or the Polish economy.
   John?
   Q. Let me ask another question about abortion and Roe versus
Wade. We may get that decision this week. Now, I understand your
position: you're for a constitutional amendment regardless of which
way the Supreme Court rules.
   A. I've, yeah, I've already...
   Q. Is that right? Now, if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe
versus Wade and sends this back to the states, would it not be less
divisive to let the states decide this rather than go through the
whole long, tortuous process of a constitutional amendment?
   A. John, I hate to not respond to your question, but the court is
probably going to make a decision very soon, and I would prefer to
address myself to the question after the court has decided.
   Q. It is still your position, though, sir, that you favor a
constitutional amendment regardless?
   A. I've positioned it _ my position on that abortion question has
not changed.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, you'll soon be proposing some campaign
financing reforms. What is it about the current system of campaign
financing that makes you think some kind of broad reform is
required? And if broad reform is important, why not go ahead and go
all the way to public financing of campaigns, or some kind of a
limit on overall spending on congressional campaigns?

<HEAD>West Germany Checking Allegations of U.S. Company's Deal With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials are checking U.S.
allegations that a West German company was involved in the sale of
chemicals aimed at producing poison gas for Iran, the Foreign
Ministry confirmed today.
   West German officials also had asked Iran to recall a Bonn-based
diplomat allegedly linked to the suspected chemicals deal but he had
already left the country, the ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman, Hans Schumacher, said the request to have
the diplomat recalled was based on U.S. information about his
suspected links to the chemicals purchase.
   ``The person in question has not worked at the (Iranian) Embassy
for some time and will not resume his duties there,'' Schumacher
said.
   Schumacher did not say when the Iranian diplomat was asked to
leave or identify him by name.
   Informed sources in Bonn, who requested anonymity, identified him
as Seyed Karim Ali Sobhani.
   Another Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that federal
officials are taking steps to investigate the U.S. allegations. ``We
were informed by the Americans about this last week,'' said Rainer
Mueller, a ministry spokesman for Middle East affairs.
   Mueller was replying to a query about a report in The New York
Times today that a Duesseldorf company had acted as a broker to sell
of tons of thionyl chloride to a manufacturer in India.
   The chemical can be used to make mustard gas, and was intended
for use by Iran, the report said. It said the bulk of the chemicals
was not delivered.
   ``We have notified the appropriate departments to take the
necessary steps'' for an investigation, Mueller said in a telephone
interview.
   Mueller declined to name the company being investigated.
   The Iranian diplomat, Sobhani, was allegedly involved in the case
of a West German national who was arrested in July 1988 in the
United States for attempting to ship thiodiglycol, a precursor for
mustard gas, to Iran via Singapore and Karachi, Pakistan.
   The West German, Peter Walaschek, later pleaded guilty to
violating U.S. export laws and said he purchased the chemicals at
the request of Sobhani.
   Walaschek fled a halfway house where he was confined, and U.S.
officials said in May that they believe he returned to West Germany.
   Late last year, U.S. officials accused West German firms of
helping Libya to build a chemical weapons plant south of Tripoli.
Libya said the plant was to make pharmaceuticals, not weapons.
   Following a lengthy investigation, officials arrested Juergen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen, the former head of Imhausen-Chemie company, in
connection with the Libyan deal. His case is still pending.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling That CBS Lost Trademark for Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
CBS Inc. no longer enjoys trademark protection for the ``Amos `N'
Andy'' radio and television shows.
   The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal
appeals court ruling that CBS abandoned the trademarks when, under
pressure from civil rights groups, it suspended commercial use of
the shows.
   The asserted trademarks were challenged by Stephen M. Silverman,
who wants to produce a musical play based on the ``Amos `N' Andy''
shows and their characters.
   The case now returns to a federal judge in New York City, who is
to rule on other aspects of the dispute. Today's high court action
does not remove all legal hurdles confronting Silverman.
   The characters of Amos Jones and Andy Brown were created in 1928
by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, who wrote and produced the
``Amos `N' Andy'' radio program, one of the nation's most popular.
   Gosden and Correll were white, but Amos and Andy and all other
characters portrayed on the program were black.
   CBS bought all rights to the show and its creations in 1948, and
broadcast it until 1955.
   In 1951, CBS began broadcasting an ``Amos `N' Andy'' television
show using black actors.
   The television series also attained great popularity, and a
generation of TV viewers came to know George ``Kingfish'' Stevens;
his wife, Sapphire; lawyer Algonquin J. Calhoun and the Mystic
Knights of the Sea Lodge.
   The television show was aired on CBS affiliate stations until
1953. It continued in reruns and non-network syndication until 1966,
when CBS responded to criticism that the show presented a demeaning
portrayal of blacks.
   Silverman in 1981 asked CBS for permission to produce a play
based on a script called ``Amos `N' Andy Go To the Movies.'' The
play's proposed title later was changed to ``Amos `N' Andy In
Hollywood,'' and finally to ``Fresh Air Taxi.''
   CBS refused permission, and Silverman sued in 1984.
   The suit alleged that CBS had no trademark or other exclusive
rights in the material contained in the first 20 years of Amos `N'
Andy radio shows.
   U.S. District Judge Gerald L. Goettel ruled for CBS on the
trademark issue. He said the network offered a reasonable
explanation for its decision to keep the programs off the air and
asserted its intention to resume use at some indefinite future date.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Feb. 6 reversed
that ruling.
   The appeals court said the trial judge misinterpeted the federal
trademark law's handling of abandonment.
   ``More likely, Congress wanted a mark to be deemed abandoned once
use has been discontinued with an intent not to resume within the
reasonably foreseeable future,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for CBS said other appeals
courts have ruled that ``an outside cause for suspension of use of a
trademark precludes abandonment.''
   The case is CBS Inc. vs. Silverman, 88-1804.

<HEAD>Socialist Mandate To Form Coalition Government Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing Premier Andreas Papandreou today
failed to gain communist support in forming a coalition government
that would lead Greece out of a nine-day political deadlock.
   Negotiations between the premier's Panhellenic Socialist Movement
and the communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended at
noon without an agreement.
   Papandreou was forced to appoint a representative to negotiate on
his behalf.
   The 70-year-old premier was admitted to General State Hospital on
Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoing
heart surgery. Hospital officials said he developed heart and kidney
complications Sunday and was on a dialysis machine for three hours.
   A medical bulletin issued by his doctors today said he was
``continually improving.''
   Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party
received a majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat
Parliament.
   Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said Tuesday that the
socialist proposals ``were equally interesting'' as those made to
him last week by the conservatives, who finished first in the
elections but failed to build a coalition.
   Florakis did not disclose the proposals. The conservative New
Democracy Party had proposed a government in which the leftists
would control the justice and interior ministries.
   Florakis said that he would hold meetings with conservative and
socialist representatives on Wednesday, when his alliance begins
attempts to build a coalition government.
   It appeared that the Coalition had little chance of leading an
alliance with either the support of the Socialists or the
conservatives.
   If the three major parties cannot form a coalition government,
new elections will be called.

<HEAD>Recator Accident May Have Contaminated Soviet Submarine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leak in the nuclear power system of a
Soviet submarine probably contaminated the vessel but not the
environment, a Norwegian expert said today.
   The submarine, built in the 1960s, billowed smoke and steam when
its reactor's cooling system broke down Monday, 70 miles from the
coast of northern Norway.
   Soviet officials say there was no radiation leak. They say the
reactor was shut down and no one was injured.
   But Knut Gussgard, acting chairman of Norway's Committee on
Peacetime Nuclear Accidents, said pieced-together details of the
accident aboard the Echo-II Class submarine show a reactor cooling
circuit most likely leaked radioactive water and steam into the
vessel.
   Gussgard, from the Norwegian Nuclear Energy Safety Authority,
said by telephone that too little information is available to judge
the effect of such radiation on the crew.
   Just before Monday's accident, submarine Capt. V. Ovisjinnkov was
quoted as telling the Soviet publication Smena that Soviet nuclear
submarine crews are poorly trained, know little about procedures and
can handle fewer than half the situations they should master.
   It was the second Soviet submarine accident in three months. On
April 7, an advanced Mike Class nuclear submarine sank 207 miles
away in the Norwegian Sea. Forty-two Soviet sailors died. No
radiation was reported.
   Last week, the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky rammed the ice
pack off Norway. None of the 950 passengers were hurt.
   Johan Baarli, of Norway's Institude for Radiation Hygiene, said
preliminary water and air tests show no radiation from the Echo II
accident.
   ``But the tests would not measure radiation aboard ship,'' Baarli
said in an interview.
   Reports said that with its reactor being kept cool with fresh
water pumped from a Soviet escort vessel, the damaged submarine was
sailing toward its home port in the northern Soviet Union.
   ``We don't like the idea of them having to cool the reactor with
water from another ship. Even with the reactor shut down, if it
loses all cooling the afterheat of the reactor could be enough to
cause problems,'' said Gussgard.
   Officials of this NATO member nation have criticized Moscow's
slowness in warning them of potential danger and express concern
about general safety of Soviet submarines.
   Oslo's Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst called Monday for a
special agreement requiring the Soviets to inform Norway of
dangerous situations near its coast.
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman told the newspaper Dagbladet today
that the Soviets regretted the delay but had not considered the
accident threatening enough to warrant a warning.
   Norway is concerned that 100 nuclear submarines operating out of
the Soviet North Fleet base on the Kola Peninsula, just over
Norway's northern border, may be dangerous even in peacetime.
   The submarines, including about 30 of the older Echo II design,
regularly pass through and patrol a narrow, strategically important
corridor to the North Atlantic that follows Norway's coast, a
Norwegian defense spokesman said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: congressional campaigns?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. I oppose public financing of these campaigns. I think people
should be able to attract private support, and I think participation
by individuals in the political process through financial support is
very, very important. I don't want to see eroding out, the eroding
out of participation by Americans in the political process. So, I'm
opposing, I will oppose and have opposed the public financing of all
of these campaigns. Now, there are proposals that I'm not prepared
to discuss in detail, though I see others have already started
dicussing what I might do on Thursday. I will have specific
proposals, but _ and I think they'll be fairly far-reaching, because
I want to see reform, real reform, and they'll be good proposals.
But I'm not prepared to go into what I'm going to do now except to
say, I will not support kicking the citizen out of the political
process by saying hat a citizen cannot financially support the
candidate of his or her choice.
   Q. So if I could follow-up. If the broad outlines of what you are
going to do as reported are correct, there's going to be some
accusations that they help Republicans more than Democrats. How are
you going to respond...
   A. Why would anyone make a charge like that against me when I'm
looking at it as objectively as I can? Let's wait till you see what
the _ what it, what it, what the proposals are. I mean, I would be
outraged by a suggestion of that nature.
   Yeah?
   Q. You and Mr. Gorbachev are touring each other's back yards in
Europe. And now that you've finished your foreign policy reviews
with regard to the Soviet Union, have you moved any closer to
perhaps meeting with the general secretary?
   A. That _ I wouldn't say ``closer.'' That matter will be
discussed again. It's having been discussed once by the secretary
and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. But I _ so I guess I'd, I'd leave
it right there.
   There will, obviously at some point, be a meeting, but I still
feel I'd like the meeting to be seen as productive rather than just
the meeting itself. But I _ let me say this. I feel comfortable
about the wavelength we're on with the Soviet Union now and I think
they feel comfortable in the sense that I think they know we want to
move forward with START. They know that we are prepared to move
swiftly forward with the conventional force, rectifying the
conventional force imbalance and indeed, I got the feeling from
talking to Chancellor Kohl that Mr. Gorbachev was not hung up on the
timetable that we set.
   So, we're coming closer on some of these broad, broad scale
objectives and then there are some very nice smaller things, their
help, that Soviet ship helping with the cleanup; and our kids from
Brooks going over to help with the burn _ our specialized burn unit,
really qualified people, the best in helping with burns, going to
the Soviet Union, and then the outreach at the time of Yerevan. So,
there are some atmospherics that I think are very, very important
and harmonious that will help when we sit down to hammer out the
details on the strategic arms talks or on these other matters.
   Q. Could I ask you, to follow up, to perhaps define a little bit
more what ``useful'' or ``progress'' would be in terms of a meeting?
Are you setting a precondition, as President Reagan did, that you
need something to sign? Or is there...
   A. No, I don't think it should be something to sign, but I would
like to think that the criterion, the governing criterion, would be
so that the world would see the meeting as having been successful,
something good happening out of it. And it doesn't have to be
signing necessarily, although, I've been around this track long
enough to know that you can always whip out something to sign, a
fishing agreement or something of this nature. But, so we could have
that, but I'm not saying that we _ that it should be hung up on a
major treaty of some sort before I would sit down with Mr.
Gorbachev. Maybe we'll do it like this: say, ``Hey, let's get
together.'' And, I'm interested in what he thinks about it. And
we've had some communication back and forth. But all I want to say
is I think the relationship is going in the right general direction,
albeit we have tremendous differences with the Soviet Union still _
and I still have _ guided by a certain sense of caution.
   Over here and then up here.
   Q. Mr. President, you made much during the campaign and after
your election of your relationship with China's leaders and, yet,
for the past several weeks, been unable to contact them. And China
appears to have ignored our calls for clemency and for dialogue.
Sir, do you not think the relationship was oversold?
   A. No, I don't think it was oversold.
   Q. Then tell us what benefit we've gained from it.

   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison battered
the Gulf Coast today with torrential rain, sending streams and
bayous over their banks, turning roads into canals and killing at
least one person.
   Before it was downgraded to a tropical depression early today,
the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season also was
blamed for the partial collapse of the roof at Northline Mall in
Houston and for the capsizing of a tugboat in Galveston Bay. No
serious injuries were reported in those incidents.
   The slow-moving storm swept ashore Monday about 60 miles
southwest of Houston. Forecasters said rainfall eventually might be
measured in feet.
   ``We hope it won't become a reality but it is a possibility,''
Ron Stagno of the National Weather Service in Houston.
   No relief was expected until late today because the system was
moving so slowly _ only 6 mph to the north.
   During the morning rush hour, high water closed both major
highways into Houston from the north, and freeway underpasses and
service roads were littered with abandoned vehicles.
   ``It's a helpless feeling,'' said stranded motorist Miles Nye.
``There's nothing you can do. You just watch the water moving up.''
   Some underpasses had as much as 15 or 20 feet of water. An empty
city bus stuck in an underpass near downtown was barely visible in
the water.
   At 5 a.m., the poorly defined center of the depression was about
50 miles north of Houston.
   Maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph with 45 mph gusts along
the eastern Texas-western Louisiana coast, the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. Maximum sustained winds must be
at least 39 mph for a depression to be a named tropical storm.
   More than 10 inches of rain fell in the Houston area during the
24 hours that ended early today, the weather service said. ``The
main thing is the rain,'' said meteorologist Larry Vannozzi. ``It's
a heavy rainmaker.''
   The heavy rain and flooding extended into southwestern Louisiana,
where a tornado overturned trailers in rural Hackberry today. In
Texas, authorities reported a tornado Monday evening at Smithpoint
and Double Bayou.
   The storm was blamed for the fatal traffic accident of a
46-year-old Port Neches man Monday evening, police said.
   Rain fell at an inch per hour in some areas and deluges were
expected to continue today into east Texas and southwest Louisiana.
   Hardest hit areas were along the Texas coast although damage
appeared to be minor, confined to downed power lines and some roof
shingles blown away. Damage from high water also was reported.
   Flash-flood warnings were in effect for the coastal counties
south of Houston while the rest of southeast Texas was under a
flash-flood watch.
   ``It's starting to come up pretty fast,'' Don Best, of Danbury in
Brazoria County, said as his family tried to save household
belongings from rising waters. ``We're trying to put our furniture
up as fast as we can.''
   In east Houston, fire department airboats were used to evacuate
dozens of residents of two apartment complexes bordering a bayou.
   ``It doesn't look like there's going to be any relief,'' fireman
Lester Tyra said. ``The only way out is with an airboat.''
   Allison was upgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning. The
storm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved from the
Pacific Ocean across Mexico last week. The Atlantic hurricane season
runs from June to November.
   In Galveston Bay, the capsized tugboat sent a barge loaded with
benzene aground in the Houston Ship Channel. Three people escaped
serious injury and the barge was not believed to be damaged, Coast
Guard spokesman Mark Kennedy said.
   ``It may be able to ride out the storm aground,'' Kennedy said.
``These are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it won't
be a problem.''
   Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. at one point reported 30,000
customers without electricity.
   The University of Houston, Rice University and Texas Southern
University were among schools to cancel classes.

   Authorities today released two American
and two West German pilots 10 days after they were detained and
questioned for flying over restricted airspace, U.S. and West German
diplomats said.
   ``I can confirm that the four pilots ... were unconditionally
released on Tuesday,'' said a U.S. Embassy official who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   The State Department has identified the Americans as Frank Haile
Jr. of Dallas and Carson Gilmore of Rocksprings, Texas.
   A West German Embassy official said two Germans, whom he
identified only by their last names as Kuhlmann and Kuffner, also
were released today.
   ``I can confirm that the two Germans left this morning at 11.26
a.m. for Bahrain in their Beechcraft plane,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   U.S. diplomats in New Delhi refused to disclose more information
about the Americans or their whereabouts, citing the U.S. Privacy
Act.
   The Americans also were flying a Beechcraft Bonanza, in formation
with the West Germans, when Indian air force fighters forced them
down June 16 for intruding into restricted airspace in western
Gujarat state, Defense Ministry officials said.
   Indian officials said the planes had deviated 310 miles from
their prescribed course and had come close to a defense airfield in
Bhuj, 500 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   The airspace over Bhuj, near the Pakistan border, is closed to
commercial air traffic.
   Civil aviation authorities cleared the planes to fly from New
Delhi to Bahrain via Bombay.
   Haile, 57, the owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering
firm, had departed with Gilmore from Addison airport more than four
weeks ago on an around-the-world trip.

<HEAD>Radical Students Fight Police; Threaten to March to North Korea</HEAD>

   A national student group said today it
will defy a government ban and march to communist North Korea to
attend a youth festival.
   Other students hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police on two
campuses Monday. Official Yonhap news agency said 15 students were
arrested.
   The chairman of the radical National Council of Student
Representatives told a news conference he expects 15,000 students to
congregate at Seoul's Hanyang University for a march Friday, the eve
of the festival.
   ``We've not given up hope to go to North Korea,'' said Im
Chong-suk.
   The World Youth Festival will be held in North Korea's capital,
Pyongyang, July 1-8.
   Prosecutors confirmed they issued warrants Monday for the arrest
of Im and two other leaders of the radical student group, charging
them with violating the National Security Law by talking on the
telephone with North Korean students. The law forbids communication
with people in an ``anti-state'' body. Im was undeterred. He said
South Korean students plan to draft a joint communique with North
Korean students and, if they cannot get to Pyongyang, details will
be arranged through third countries using telephones and facsimile
machines.
   Students holding valid passports and those studying overseas are
being encouraged to try to get to Pyongyang through third countries,
he said. The Seoul government says any who attend without notifying
the government or a South Korean Embassy can be prosecuted.
   Seoul accuses Pyongyang of using the festival to stir up
dissident movements in South Korea _ a charge the Noth Korean
government denies. The festival is a political and sports event
attended mostly by youths from the Third World and communist bloc.
   At Hanyang University Monday, fighting erupted when 200 students
screaming anti-government slogans and hurling rocks and firebombs
attacked riot police blocking campus gates.
   About 500 visored police ringed the campus and stopped outsiders
from entering. Student leaders said some students from the provinces
already were inside.
   In provincial Taegu city, police fired tear gas to disperse 500
students from three schools who attacked them with firebombs and
rocks outside Yongnam University, according to Yonhap.
   The South Korean agency said 15 students were arrested.
   South and North Korea have been bitter rivals since their land
was divided at the end of World War II. North Korea invaded the
south in 1950 and the three-year Korean War left more than l million
dead on both sides. A truce was never signed and enmity deepened.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: was oversold.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. What we've gained is, China has a much more open economic
system than when the Shanghai communique was signed quite a few
years ago. What we've gained is 30,000 students right this minute, I
think the figure is, studying in the United States. Chinese kids
going back there with a sense of what freedom and democracy is all
about. What we have gained is helping China move out of a period of
Cultural Revolution isolation. And this relationship is important.
And I can continue to express my outrage about what happened in
Tiananmen Square. But _ and I will _ but I am determined to do my
level best to keep from injuring the very people that we're trying
to help, and I'm talking about the Chinese people generally.
   So we've gained a lot from this relationship, and so have they.
And I still think that it is in the strategic interest of the United
States. I'm not talking about the old adage of playing the China
card or something of that nature, or playing the Soviet card. But if
you look at the world and you understand the dynamics of the Pacific
area, good relationships with China are in the national interest of
the United States. Now, it's hard to have them. It's impossible at
this moment to have what I would say are normalized relations, for
various, very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level best to
find a way to see improvement there that will help the Chinese
people.
   Q. If I could follow, sir.
   A. Please.
   Q. It's your personal relationship with China's leaders that I'm
speaking of. I'm looking for the benefit when you cannot even
complete a phone call to Deng Xiaoping. I'm wondering if the
personal relationship is...
   A. The benefit is, I understand the situation. That's the
benefit. And leaders are changing all the time over there, so _ I
mean recently _ so we've got to deal with who is there. We don't
dictate to China about their leaders. We express our concerns, as
other leaders have. But let me be very clear. In my view, the United
States has been out front, we've been out front on the steps we've
taken. And I am very pleased that there has been broad support for
the position I have taken. And I heard it just today from the prime
minister of Australia, one of the most knowledgeable men about
China. The Australians, you see, have always had a _ they've had,
been a little out front. They've had relations before we did. And
they have a rather, almost a unique standing in China; they've done
a lot of business with China. They've worked _ they've had a lot of
exchanges with China. Bob Hawke feels that he knows most of the
Chinese leaders, the ones that we had been dealing with. And to hear
him say _ be as supportiv as he was today _ was very reassuring to
me.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, how concerned are you...
   A. Yes, Jesse, you're next.
   Q. How concerned are you that the retreat _ the political retreat
that we've seen in China in recent weeks _ could be duplicated in
the Soviet Union?
   A. Well, I did not predict what would happen in Tiananmen Square
and I don't know of any China expert, scholar or otherwise, who
predicted that. And I guess the lesson is go forward as best you
can, keep your eyes open, hold high the banner of values that we
believe in the United States. We have a special responsibility
around the world in terms of human rights and democracy, freedom.
But keep your eyes open. That's what I've learned from this.
   Q. Have you had any communications with Secretary Gorbachev on
the situation in China?
   A. Not on China. Maybe others in the administration _ not
Gorbachev personally, but I've followed carefully the statements out
of there and, obviously, the Soviet Union has tried to, with
Gorbachev's visit to China, tried to improve relations. But I think
that's on a little bit of a hold, although maybe they're more
accommodating than we are right now.
   Yeah, Jessica?
   Q. Mr. President, women's groups have been very pleasantly
surprised and saluting you for your statements yesterday about
violence, crimes against women and spousal abuse. And a couple have
asked the question whether you will be willing to take that message
to men's groups _ one said those ``macho groups'' _ such as the NRA,
the American Legion, the Police Chiefs of America, and ask them to
stop _ to get the word out to stop beating their wives and stop
beating _ the generic thing, not specific.
   A. Hey listen, I'm a member of the NRA. You're hurting my
feelings, as they say in China.
   Q. And the question is whether you will take the message to men's
groups, instead of to the American Association of University Women.
   A. Jessica, I hope that the message that _ because of the line of
work you all are engaged in _ I hope that message got to every
group. But I don't want to single out or acquiesce in a hypothesis
here and..
   Q. But you did say...
   A. Say that the NRA is against women or the other groups you
singled out?
   Q. But you spoke _ you talked about...
   A. Come on, Jessie.
   Q. But you talked about it to women who are very well aware of
the problem. Your staffers here say they move their cars closer to
the White House after dark and have someone walk out with them. So
women know about the problem. My question is whether you will go and
take the message to men's groups and ask their help in eradicating
the problem.
   A. I'm trying to take the message to the whole country. That's
what our whole crime package is about _ absolutely, anybody that
wants to listen.
   Q. Now, you said also that you wanted to...
   A. This is a follow-up, yes.

   A. Well, you have no choice, Tom. If the Chinese say they're not
welcome, they can't come in. And it's too bad, because one of the
things that moved forward the reforms was contact with Americans.
And I don't want to see those contacts cut off. And I'm sorry that
the Chinese have made that decision. I would like to have seen those
young volunteers go to China and help teach English to the Chinese.
And I like these student exchanges, and I don't want to hurt the
Chinese people.
   Now, I have expressed my concern about what went on in China;
I'll reiterate my concern here today. But I reiterate also my desire
not to do damage to the people themselves, because I believe that it
was contact with the United States and others in the West that have
moved the process of economic reform forward, and hopefully, some
day, will move the process of political reform forward.
   Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, while you were vice president, millions were
syphoned off from HUD through self-confessed influence peddlers,
many of which _ who _ were your friends. The homeless grew by the
thousands. I have not heard one word of outrage about this from you.
You seem to absolve Pierce, who sat on this gold mine, permitted
this kind of abuse for so many years, and _ not absolve him _ but
you don't criticize him at all. Who was to blame? Where did the buck
stop?
   A. That matter is being looked into by our very able, dedicated
secretary of HUD and we are going to do everything we can to clean
up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur.
   But you're always looking for winners and losers, and I am not
about to prejudge the secretary himself. I assume that he would
accept responsibility for what happened _ past tense _ in his
department, just as I would have to assume responsibility for
something that goes on in my administration, whether I know about it
or not. But let's not be trying to find winners and losers. Let's
guarantee the American people that we are not going to have cronyism
and special favors and giving contracts because of who you know.
Let's keep it on the merits.
   Q. The people were the losers in this. The Republican leaders
apparently, their influence peddlers, and so forth, were the
winners. Where were you in eight years?
   A. I wasn't handling HUD, Helen, in eight years...
   Q. I know you weren't handling HUD, but...
   A. But if you want to assign _ look, this will give you a little
relief. If you want to assign blame of the vice president for what
happened over a past of eight years, okay, that's fine. I accept it.
But what I want to do as president is see that we don't have any
recurrence and I have total confidence that Jack Kemp is working to
see that this does not happen again and I hope that the message has
gone out loud and clear to every cabinet officer that we want the
highest possible ethical standards.
   Q. Were you aware of any atmosphere? That's all I'm asking.
   A. No.
   Q. Mr. President?
   A. Yeah, Brit?
   Q. In light of your renewed concern about the display of proper
reverence to the flag, I wonder if you think it helps the situation,
sir, for you and other political figures of both parties to make the
flag the kind of instrument of partisan politics that it was in your
campaign last fall, with the visit to Flag City and the tour of flag
factories and flags at all the conventions and so on.
   A. I don't view that as partisanship. I think respect for the
flag transcends political party, and I think what I've said here is
American, it isn't Republican or Democrat, it isn't liberal or
conservative. And I just feel very, very strongly about it. And
perhaps I haven't been quite as emotional as I feel about it, but I
want to take this opportunity to say, protest should not extend to
desecration of the unique symbol of America, and that is our flag.
   Follow up.
   Q. You wouldn't dispute, would you, sir, that your visit to Flag
City USA and your visit to the flag factory last year were for the
purpose of advancing your political campaign.
   A. Everything I did last year was for the purpose of advancing my
_ everything I did politically _ advancing my election. And of
course, I'm not going to say that. But I'm not _ I didn't put it on
the basis that Republicans are for the flag and Democrats are not.
   John?
   Q. Mr. President, leaving aside the winners and losers question
on the HUD scandal, isn't it fair criticism, nevertheless, that the
laissez-faire sort of management exhibited by Sam Pierce was, as a
matter of fact, encouraged by the president himself, and that they
really didn't pay attention to what was going on over there?

   More than 200 Iranian legislators are
urging the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's son, Ahmad, to run for
parliament, Tehran Radio reported today.
   Iranian opposition groups claim the move is to head off an open
power struggle between radicals led by Ahmad Khomeini and so-called
pragmatists headed by Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Majlis, or
parliament. Rafsanjani is the only announced candidate in the July
28 presidential election.
   ``We call upon your excellency to be in the Majlis ... to become
a cause of strength, encouragement and guidance for this important
pillar of legislation in the arena of the country's decisions,''
said a letter signed by 205 deputies, the radio said.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the daily Tehran
Times as saying the deputies suggested Ahmad Khomeini become speaker
of the 270-seat legislature if he wins an election in Rafsanjani's
Tehran constituency. The radio and agency were monitored in Nicosia.
   Rafsanjani will have to relinquish his seat to run for the
presidency. But no date has been set for the by-election.
   There has been growing speculation that the politically ambitious
Ahmad, 43, would declare himself a candidate to run against the
powerful Rafsanjani.

   A harbor pilot today said he radioed
three warnings to the World Prodigy to change course before the
tanker ran aground and spilled 420,000 gallons of oil.
   But the pilot, David G. Leonard, told a Coast Guard-National
Transportation Safety Board hearing he could not be certain the
message was received because there was a lot of radio interference
at the time.
   The 533-foot Greek tanker hit a reef at the mouth of Narragansett
Bay on Friday after failing to wait for the pilot to board and guide
the vessel into port.
   Rhode Island authorities are investigating whether the ship was
past the point at which a pilot is required by state law.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete testified that hours after the spill, the
captain admitted he was at fault. The governor said he asked Iakovos
Georgoudis, ``Why were you in that location which requires a pilot
to be on board?''
   ``He said, `That was my mistake,''' DiPrete said. ``He made no
bones about it.''
   Leonard said he first talked with the ship about 4:30 p.m. Friday
and that the tanker reported it was about 2{ miles from the point
where Leonard was supposed to meet it and guide it into the bay.
   ``My first words were, `Aim the vessel more toward the (Brenton
Light) tower,''' Leonard testified. ``That was not correct, so I
said `Head the vessel more toward the tower.' Then I said, `Keep the
red buoy on your starboard bow.'''
   The pilot said he repeated the warning twice but could not be
sure it got through.
   ``That transmission, there was interference with a lot of
small-boat traffic,'' Leonard said. He said that interference is
common during the summer and called on the Coast Guard to do
something to free up vital radio channels.
   Most of the spilled oil had dispersed or evaporated by today and
no longer posed much of a threat to the shore, officials said.
   ``It's going to flush out by itself,'' said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Mike Gilmore, overseeing the cleanup at Hull Cove in
Jamestown.
   There had been reports of lobsters killed and several small birds
found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be widespread.
   State Attorney General James O'Neil seized the ship's records and
has begun criminal investigation. He planned to convene a grand jury
on Wednesday.

   Q. Please. You want to be sure that your seven granddaughters
have the same opportunities that your pride and joy, George P., has.
George P. is one whom you take on fishing trips, into the back rooms
with the boys, and to the research camp at the University of
Nebraska and things like that. I wonder if you're planning to take
some of the granddaughters on some of these kinds of excursions
where you're doing the business of the nation to prepare them to be
president?
   A. Yeah. When they get older than about 3, I will do that,
because now _ I know, now don't you say it, I'll say it _ Jenna and
Barbara are about 7, but that's a little young to go fishing in
Jackson Hole with their grandfather and put up with Marlin Fitzwater
and all of these people. I mean, I want them prepared for the real
world. I'm serious. I want them prepared, and I look forward to the
day that those _ they're the _ Noelle, who is just a couple of years
behind George P., she came up here, we had her with us and she
brought her cousin, and we had a wonderful time. And I want her to
come back. Indeed, they'll be with us this summer. So _ but no, you
raise a good point, and it isn't _ my affection for our oldest
grandson is _ it's just that he's there and he's ready. And he plays
ball and he does stuff, and we're going to the Orioles game
tomorrow, I think it is. And so _ but it is not discriminatory, it
is not discriminatory.
   Yeah.
   Q. Mr. President, if I could ask one last question...
   A. Or wasn't I not supposed to say that _ What, about the ball
game? Come on.
   Q. Some things that you just can't ...
   Q. If I could ask one last question on the HUD scandal?
   A. Yeah?
   Q. I think that many people would think it's unfair to hold you
responsible when you were vice president for the things that were
going on at HUD. But some of the people who have been implicated in
this scandal are very close to you. I'm thinking of both Frederick
Bush, who was your key fundraiser in the campaign, and Paul
Manafort, who was an adviser to your campaign and a partner of Lee
Atwater, your campaign manager. Have you made any effort to find out
exactly what these people who are close to you were doing with HUD,
or to express your views of it to them? Have you made any efforts in
those regards?
   A. I'm not singling out any, you know, _ going, say, look for
people that I know that may have done business with HUD in the past.
What I am trying to do is do it generically. Say to the degree there
was any breaking of the law, obviously the people should pay the,
whatever the price is. To the degree we can guard against any abuse
for the future, I want to go the extra mile to do that. And one of
the first things I did as president, unnoted though it was, was to
meet with the inspectors general in here and encourage them towards
independence and thorough investigation. And so, that's the way I am
trying to handle that matter.
   Q. As a follow-up, does this affect your relationship with these
people, to know that they were involved apparently in influence
peddling?
   A. Well, it doesn't improve things, but on the other hand I want
to be fair. I want to be sure that I don't jump at conclusions as to
what guilt is and what it isn't, whether law was broken or were
people just out there, you know, doing what was permitted. I want to
have the standard higher, though, even if it's permitted. I want to
have the highest possible standard, but I haven't put it on that
kind of a personal basis yet.
   Q. Mr. President, the Senate has just passed a child care bill
that would spend almost $9 billion in federal funds on child care.
Your spokesman says that bill is a candidate for a veto. Do you
intend to veto that bill, and what are your objections?
   A. I want to see what comes down here. But if there was one thing
that was clear _ I've got to be careful of these gestures, the way
these, Rich Little and these guys _ but if there was one thing that
was clear, one thing that was clear, it was my position on child
care: maximum choice through credits. And the ABC bill does not fit
what I think is the proper description for child care. And to then _
for me to take the back seat and say, ``I'm less concerned about
child care because I'm unenthusiastic about the ABC bill,'' I don't
accept that at all. So I remain convinced that what I have proposed
is the right way to go about it. I would like to see what comes down
here before I make further statements about what action I will take
or won't take. I want to know the final, you know, piece of
legislation that hits this desk.
   Q. But you would veto the bill as it stands now.
   A.I've made my position clear on the ABC bill.
   Yeah.
   Q. Sir, you say you don't want to prejudge Secretary Pierce, but
doesn't the evidence of mismanagement and influence-peddling make it
evident to you that there were major problems there at the very top?
   A. Yes, yes.
   Q. And what can be done about that?
   A. Well, that's what the process, that's what the secretary is
trying to do right now, is to make guarantees and put out
regulations to see that these kinds of abuses _ a woman sitting in
Maryland ripping off $5 million from the American taxpayers, that's
wrong. And that _ and I expect that's in the courts. I don't know,
that's where it should be, in my view.
   Yeah, Frank?

<HEAD>Five Bulgarian Dissidents Arrested, Emigre Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five dissidents have been arrested in
Bulgaria, but it is unclear when or if they will go on trial, an
emigre source reported Tuesday.
   The source confirmed the arrest in Sofia last month of the Rev.
Hristofor Sabev, an Orthodox priest from Veliko Turnovo who founded
the Independent Committee for Religious Freedom.
   It was believed that Sabev, 43, was taken into custody because of
his support for religious and human rights in Bulgaria, including
the Turkish minority's ethnic rights.
   In early June, authorities also arrested Todor Gagalov, an
economist and vice president of Podkrepa, an independent
intellectuals' union, one of about eight dissident groups that have
arisen in Bulgaria recently.
   Three other leading members of Podkrepa, including Konstantin
Trenchev, its president, were arrested last month.
   Bulgarian government officials said Friday about 50 people were
under investigation for their role in ethnic Turkish disturbances
last month that Western diplomats say killed 30 people.
   The clashes with Bulgarian security forces occurred as
authorities sought to disperse demonstrators calling for restoration
of religious and civil rights of the 1 million-member Turkish
minority.
   More than 70,000 of the ethnic Turks have already left Bulgaria
for Turkey after the Sofia government opened its borders early this
month.

   The wing of a taxiing jetliner clipped the tail
section of another today at Heathrow Airport as the aircraft were
preparing to take off, but none of the 480 people on the planes was
injured, airline officials said.
   The incident involved a British Airways Boeing 757 carrying 111
passengers and seven crew members to Brussels and a Thai Airways
International Boeing 747 en route to Bangkok.
   Both jets suffered minor damage when the wing of the Thai jet
struck the tail section of the stationary British Airways jet as the
Bangkok flight was taxiing toward the runway, said Linda Jones, a
spokeswoman for British Airways.
   ``It was actually a very minor accident,'' Ms. Jones said.
``People on board probably were not aware of it.''
   British Airways passengers were transferred to another plane.
Thai Airways was making alternative arrangements for its 348
passengers, said airline spokesman Jeff Bacall. The Thai flight had
a 21-member crew.
   A Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity in keeping with British practice, said: ``It is a
reportable incident and will be investigated by the Air
Investigations Branch.''

<TEXT>
   Kraft today said it is mailing $250 checks to
hundreds of people who claim they won a $17,000 van that was
supposed to be the grand prize in a botched contest.
   Letters accompanying the checks say that the payment ``represents
our appreciation for your understanding and good will'' and that the
company is ``sorry for any confusion or disappointment the flawed
game may have caused.''
   Because of a printing error, the ``Ready to Roll'' game pieces
Kraft offered last month in newspapers in the Chicago and Houston
areas matched virtually all game pieces in packages of Kraft cheese,
making hundreds, possibly thousands, of people apparent winners of a
1990 Dodge Caravan.
   The company nullified the contest June 12 after the error was
discovered, prompting at least two class-action lawsuits by would-be
winners.
   Kraft USA spokeswoman Kathy Knuth said from company headquarters
in suburban Glenview that the number of people who mailed in
matching game pieces for the van and other prizes is not available.
Kraft is owned by Philip Morris Cos.
   The company announced the $250 consolation-prize checks along
with a modified contest in which Kraft gave claimants until June 16
to qualify for a July 14 drawing for four vans and other prizes.

<HEAD>Fire in Test Engine Could Delay Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers examined a space shuttle
main engine Tuesday to determine if damage it suffered in a
test-firing could delay this summer's launch of the shuttle Columbia.
   ``Engineers have to inspect the engine and look at the data
before they can make a decision about Columbia's launch,'' said Dave
Drachlis, a space agency spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   The failure happened Friday on a test stand at the Stennis Space
Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., during firing of a development
engine that has been ignited 23 times over several years to test new
parts for future shuttle flights.
   Columbia's three main engines already are in place as technicians
here prepare it for a launch in late July or early August on a
classified Defense Department mission.
   Jerry Smelser, head of the engine program at the Marshall center,
said NASA needs to determine if the problem involves parts similar
to those in Columbia's engines.
   Drachlis said the test engine operated normally until about 21
minutes into a planned firing of 22 minutes 17 seconds, when there
was a sudden shutdown and a fire. During a shuttle launch, the main
engines normally fire for about 8 minutes 30 seconds.
   There was significant damage to several internal parts, Drachlis
said.
   ``The engine did not blow up; it's still fundamentally intact,''
he said.
   The engine was flown to its manufacturer, the Rocketdyne Division
of Rockwell International in Canoga Park, Calif. Drachlis said
engineers would take the engine apart for detailed inspection.

   A Chinese TV factory has signed an
agreement with a South Korean company, the first time the Seoul
government has given approval for direct investment by a business
from a communist nation, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
   The Hanzhou TV Factory has signed an agreement to invest $2.8
million in a joint venture with Orion Electric Co. of South Korea
and Zhejiang Fuchen Co. of Hong Kong, a ministry spokesman said.
   Foreign investment in Korea is subject to approval by the Finance
Ministry.
   The spokesman said the joint venture with the factory was
expected to produce 580,000 20-inch tubes for color TV sets in 1989,
1.1 million tubes in 1990 and 1.2 million in 1992.
   The joint venture was expected to export 20 percent of the
production to China and Hong Kong through Zhejiang Fuchen, which has
invested $1.2 million in the venture, the ministry said.
   South Korea, which has no diplomatic relations with neighboring
China, is trying to expand trade with communist nations to enlarge
its markets and ease tension with communist North Korea.

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins today
announced a 10-point plan to ``chart a new course'' for what he
called the department's failed system of protecting the environment
and public health from nuclear weapons production.
   Watkins also said he would press for Senate confirmation of
Victor Stello as his chief assistant for nuclear weapons even if
investigations of Stello's controversial background reveal ``some
chinks in his armour.''
   Bush announced the Stello nomination as assistant secretary for
defense programs last week.
   In 1987 a Senate panel conducted a hearing on whether Stello, as
the staff chief of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was guilty of
improprieties in connection with a commission investigation of the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
   The probe included the question of whether Stello improperly
advised the manager of nuclear power at TVA on how to respond to a
commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under
construction. Stello denied any improprieties.
   ``If he has some chinks in his armour ... so be it,'' Watkins
told a news conference before flying to New Mexico to tour a desert
site on which the department is building the nation's first
permanment dump for waste generated by the weapons program.
   He disclosed that the dump, which was scheduled to open in
September, would not start receiving any waste until sometime next
year.
   Watkins said Stello has the knowledge, experience and commitment
to perform the job, which Watkins said is one the most important
management spots in the department.
   Watkins said the Stello nomination was part of a broader effort
to improve Energy Department management of the nuclear weapons
program, which has been crippled in recent years by a series of
mechanical failures and questions about safety.
   The program, conducted through 17 major weapons facilities in 12
states, produces plutonium and other nuclear materials for the
weapons, assembles the arms and conducts tests on them.
   ``I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I have seen over
my first few months in office,'' Watkins said. ``As a result, I must
continue to implement measures that can lead the department to a new
culture which takes pride in being good stewards of public lands.
...''
   Among the measures announced by Watkins:
   _Creation of a set of environmental ``tiger teams'' to conduct
independent assessments of whether the weapons plants are complying
with federal and state laws.
   _Changing the terms of department contracts with the private
companies that run the weapons plants, to put more emphasis on
rewards for safety and environmental compliance.
   _Accelerating the cleanup of the weapons plants by allocating an
additional $325 million for the budget year beginning Oct. 1,
bringing the total for the year to $2.4 billion.
   Also today, a group of 21 environmental, scientific and church
groups sued the Energy Department to try to force a broad public
review of plans for modernizing the weapons plants.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington said the
department should be compelled to prepare a Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement, a comprehensive analysis of the
environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives.
   Watkins, at his news conference, declined to comment directly on
the suit except to say he was committed to ensuring full compliance
with all environmental requirements.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group
that announced the suit, said the department is required by the
National Environmental Policy Act to prepare a public review of its
modernization plans.
   ``It is time DOE came clean with the American public about its
plans for what is really one of the nation's largest and most
dangerous industrial operations,'' said Dan W. Reicher, an attorney
for the group.
   Among the groups that joined in the suit are the Environmental
Policy Institute, Greenpeace, the Federation of American Scientists,
the Lawyers Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control Inc., and the
Physicians for Social Responsibility.

   The full-figured look just didn't suit a woman who
arrived on a flight from Guatemala, and federal agents found she was
wearing four girdles stuffed with cocaine.
   U.S. Customs Service agents detained the 38-year-old Colombian
woman Monday while she stood in line for a baggage search at Houston
Intercontinental Airport.
   ``An agent noticed she was very nervous and that she was wearing
very bulky clothing,'' said Candace Vice, chief customs inspector at
the airport.
   ``We continued the inspection and discovered 16.3 pounds of
cocaine secreted inside four girdles she was wearing,'' Ms. Vice
said.
   She said the woman was holding a ticket for a flight from Houston
to Amsterdam.
   ``She was apparently heading to Holland because the value of
cocaine is much greater there,'' she said. The cocaine would have
been worth about three times more than the estimated $92,000 it
would fetch in the United States, she said.

   China has asked the United States to delay the
start of the Peace Corps program that was to begin sending American
volunteers to China this fall to teach English, a U.S. official said
today.
   Authorities also ordered two Americans _ a teacher and a student
_ to leave the country, apparently for participating in the
student-led pro-democracy movement, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Eleven other Americans, detained Monday in Kunming and charged
with distributing religious tracts, were released and told to leave
China by Friday, the embassy said. It said the Americans, members of
the Latter Rain Ministry of Litchfield, Ill., would leave in the
next day or so.
   In Tokyo, group tours to China involving 43,000 Japanese have
been canceled since martial law was declared in Beijing in May and
troops crushed the pro-democracy movement, Japanese officials said.
Transport Ministry official Tokuji Nakamura said the cancellations
cost the agencies $60 million in sales.
   In Madrid, Spain, European leaders today called for an embargo on
arms sales to China and urged the World Bank to postpone new loans
to China to protest the government's crackdown.
   The leaders of the 12-nation European Economic Community, at
their two-day summit, condemned in a statement ``the brutal
repression taking place in China.''
   Official Chinese media reported today that the steering committee
of China's legislature would meet in special session Thursday to
endorse the Communist Party's tough stance on dissent.
   Also to be discussed are a draft law on tightening controls over
rallies and demonstrations. Plans to discuss a long-pending bill
defining the rights and responsibilities of the press have been
shelved.
   The student demonstrations of April and May _ now called the
period of turmoil _ called for greater press freedom, and for
several weeks the press enjoyed unprecedented leeway in objectively
reporting events.
   But, since political hard-liners gained the upper hand, the press
has reverted to its former role as mouthpiece of the party line.
   The Chinese gave no reason for their request last week for the
Peace Corps postponement, the U.S. official said, saying they just
wanted to put the program off ``until a more appropriate time.''
   The decision was apparently triggered by continuing tension
following the June 4 military crackdown in which soldiers killed
hundreds of unarmed protesters in clearing central Beijing of
student protesters.
   Martial law remains in effect in most of the capital.
   Twenty Americans had been scheduled to go to Sichuan province in
central China to teach English from this fall, said the U.S.
official, who would not be further identified.
   China has criticized Washington for cutting off military aid
because of the bloody crackdown and for harboring leading dissident
Fang Lizhi in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   But ``we're not reading anything retaliatory into'' the Peace
Corps postponement, the official said. ``It's not by any means
canceled.''
   The volunteers began a training program in May to prepare for
their assignments in China, which would be the 65th nation and first
communist country with a Peace Corps program.
   The two Americans ordered to leave China by Friday are a teacher
and a student at Nankai University in the northeastern port of
Tianjin, a U.S. Embassy official said on condition of anonymity.
   Contacted by telephone, a foreign affairs official at the
university identified the two as Mark Radicia, 25, of Omaha, Neb.;
and Helen Qubain, 21, of Buena Vista, Va.
   The official quoted the pair as saying police had ordered them
out of the country for violating unspecified regulations on the
behavior of foreigners. The official said Radicia taught business
management.
   Six journalists _ three Britons and three Americans _ have been
ordered out of the country since June 4 for ther reporting on the
situation.
   The official media said the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress would hear a report at its session Thursday on
``quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The Standing Committee, consisting of about 160 members, meets
every few months, usually for about a week, to discuss legislation
to be put before the annual full session of the Congress.
   Decision-making power in China rests with the party, and the
Congress' role has generally been limited to formal approval of laws
and government appointments.
   In recent years, however, it has been given more freedom to delay
or revise legislation and to debate national issues.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, reacting to a Supreme Court
decision that protects the right of protesters to burn the American
flag, called today for a constitutional amendment that would
prohibit desecration of the flag.
   Bush said ``support of the First Amendment need not extend'' to
desecration of the flag, which he termed ``the unique symbol of
America.''
   Bush fielded questions on subjects ranging from international
diplomacy to child care legislation to baseball in a free-wheeling
45-minute news conference in the White House briefing room.
   The president said:
   _ He will carry a package of economic aid when he travels to
Poland next month, but wants to first make sure that the communist
government there will follow through on economic and political
reform. He said Soviet leaders shouldn't be ``uptight'' about his
journey to Poland and Hungary.
   _ He still favors U.S. contacts with China despite the continuing
crackdown in Beijing against pro-democracy leaders.
   _ He has no plans to call for legislation to alter recent Supreme
Court rulings on affirmative action that drew criticism from civil
rights groups.
   _ He intends to make sure that any wrongdoing at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development is thoroughly aired and remedied.
   _ He criticized legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled
Senate on child care, but said he hopes agreement can be worked out
on the subject.
   Bush opened his visit to the briefing room by declaring his
support for a constitutional amendment that would negate last week's
5-4 Supreme Court decision. The court held that burning the American
flag as a form of protest is protected by the Constitution.
   Bush said it was important to protect th free-speech guarantees
of protest, but he didn't want to extend that to the flag.
   The court's decision provoked an emotional response in Congress
and elsewhere, and Bush said protection of the flag will ``in no way
limit'' constitutional rights. He said he favored a constitutional
amendment over legislation because a law ``cannot correct, in my
view, the egregious offense of burning the American flag.''
   A constitutional amendment must be approved by a two-thirds vote
of the House and Senate, and then ratified by 38 of the 50 states.
The day after the Supreme Court ruling, proposed constitutional
amendments were introduced in both houses of Congress.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., reacted angrily today when
reporters suggested that Republicans could make flag burning a
partisan issue if Democrats fail to support a constitutional
amendment to overturn the ruling.
   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,''
Foley said, calling such partisanship ``reprehensible and
disgusting.''
   Foley expressed caution about a constitutional amendment.
   ``I do not feel we should rush into an amendment to the First
Amendment of the Constitution,'' he said.
   Bush also he does not want to see contacts with the Chinese
government cut off, despite a continuing crackdown in Beijing
against leaders of a pro-democracy movement.
   ``I'm going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement
there that will help the Chinese people,'' he said. He said it was
too bad the Chinese have decided against a visit by Peace Corps
volunteers this fall.
   ``I believe that it was contact with the United States and others
in the west that moved the process of economic reforms forward and
hopefully someday will move the process of political reform
forward.''
   Bush said he does not expect his stops in Poland and Hungary next
month to be disruptive to the Communist world, and said he does not
expect Soviet leaders to be ``uptight'' abnout his presence in
Eastern Europe. He noted that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
recently went to West Germany, and was very well received there.
   ``I think it's important that the United States show its interest
in these countries,'' he said of the two Eastern European nations
currently undergoing delicate transitions to greater political
rights.
   He also vowed his administration would get to the bottom of
scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ``We
are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism and see
that matters of that nature do not recur,'' he said.
   Bush said he would not try to assign blame for the problems at
HUD.
   ``Something might be happening in some department today that I
know nothing about. We've got an enormous bureaucracy. We've got a
tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world and there
might be some corruption going,'' he said.
   Bush said he had confidence in HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who also
has vowed to clean up his department. Investigators are looking into
alleged irregularities in housing programs in several states, and
congressional committess also are probing the operation of the
department under Samuel Pierce, who served as secretary for eight
years under President Reagan.
   Bush also said his advisers have concluded that none of the
recent Sypreme Court rulings on affirmative action has jeopardized
the principles of equal opportunity for all Americans. The court has
made several rulings in recent weeks that civil rights advocates say
undercut progress made toward equal rights, and have said they
intend to ask Congress to write new protections into law.
   Bush said if the court's decisions turn out to hamper civil
rightrs enforcement, he would consider legislation.
   But he had no such reluctance on the volatile flag desecration
issue, which the court addressed last week.
   ``I believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a
constitutional amendment. Support for the Constitution need not
extend to the desecration of the American flag,'' he said.
   ``I do feel viscerally about burning the American flag,'' he said.
   Bush also used his question-and-answer session before White House
reporters to renew his opposition to abortion. The Court is expected
to issue a ruling later this week on a case involving abortion.
   Bush, an avid baseball fan, declined to answer a question on
whether Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose is being treated fairly by
an investigation into his alleged gambling on baseball games.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: Yeah, Frank?    Q. Mr. President.    A. Then I've got
to go. We've got Bob Hawke appearing...    Q. In your message...    A.
About whom I spoke highly because of his support for our policies.   
Yeah?    Q. In your message on the rescinding of the pay raise, you said
that action was necessary for judges and top federal officials. It's been
some time now. I'd like to ask what you're doing about that and when you
plan to propose some action. People are still quitting.    A. Well, I
know it, and I want to see that remedied. I'd like _ I still would like
to see the separation of consideration for judges and other key executive
branch posts. I'm thinking of some of the researchers in the NIH and people
of this nature. And I want to see it separated out so it doesn't get caught
on the question of congressional pay. Now, whether the Congress is willing
to do what I've suggested, I don't know. But I will have suggestions when
we make our announcements, I think Thursday, on _ further announcements
along this line _ as to what I think needs to be done. And I am not
trying to dictate to the legislative branch, but I am going to have to
make some recommendations, and maybe I can do that as a former member of
Congress who is concerned about what the legislative branch ought to do.
This is a matter of considerable concern.    This is the last, and then
one behind you. And then I've got to go because Bob Hawke is appearing.
   Q. A follow up, Mr. President.    A. Next time, Sarah. I'm sorry.
I got half, I got two-thirds back there. Yes?    Q. Your suggestions will
be specific pay raise proposals, and will they take the form of a proposed
legislative bill?    A. Excuse me?    Q. Will your suggestions, when
you mention them on Thursday, be specific as to salary increases?    A.
Yes.    Q. And will they take the form of a bill?    A. No _ well, yes.
I think we will have specifics on the _ I haven't, you know, gone over
this with the final recommendations internally, although I'm reading now
what I've decided and _ very clear. But there will be some specific
recommendations with amounts.    Yes, now I do _ Johanna, yes?    Q.
Mr. President, a lot of Americans this summer are talking about Pete Rose
and I wondered, without prejudging his case, what you think about betting
on baseball and whether you think that that should be reviewed by the courts
or the commissioner of baseball?    A. I am not going to get into how
that matter should be resolved. Baseball, the national pastime, has sound
rules regarding betting on baseball games and I simply am going to _ I
don't _ I'm not going to get into that one.    Yeah, last _ this is the
last. Mr. Matthews, then I'm going.    Q. Mr. President, are you concerned
that a deterioration in the U.S. relations with China would disrupt the
strategic balance between the U.S and the Soviet Union? And is that of
overriding importance in your reaction to events there?    A. It is a
matter of _ that as you look at the whole Pacific area, you have to consider
that. I have never been one who thinks that the relationship with
China ought to be based on playing the Soviet card or quote, ``playing
the China card,'' unquote. But _ and it is not _ I will not overlook fundamental
abuses of human rights because of a strategic concern. But, of course when
you look at your _ all of your relationships, a president must be concerned
about the strategic importance of the relationship. And not only is our
relationship with China of strategic importance. It has this whole cultural
and educational and art and, hopefully, some human rights side of it. So
you look at it in what is right between China and the United States. But,
of course, I'm concerned about the strategic implications.    And it's
not just the strategic implications vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Take a
look at what Deng Xiaoping used to call ``encirclement.'' And look at what
he means. Just take a look at China on the map and you'll understand why
the Chinese leaders still, as recently as three months ago, talked about
encirclement. And that gets you into the questions of the ASEAN countries;
it gets you into the question of what's happening in Cambodia today; it
gets you into question of, obviously, then Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula,
and there's a lot of strategic interest involved here.    Q. Sir, if you're
terribly sorry, why don't you do something about it? Why don't you let
me have a question a minute?    A. The questions take too _ a real short
one, and I'll go for it.    Q. All right, all right. When you went out
to see Claude Pepper, and he was dying, he rose up and said, ``Mr. President,
when are we going to get home health care?'' And you looked at him and
you wanted to cooperate with him, and I'm sure you're anxious to do something
about that. Will you tell us if you're going to do something about it?
   A. Regrettably, we can't go the route that the late Claude Pepper wanted.
But I hope we can have more emphasis on care at home. And I think that
would be a very good way to approach the health care needs of this country.
But we can't go totally with what Claude was suggesting.    Q. You didn't
explain to me what the constitutional groups have legislated on flag burning.
   A. Because I am told that legislation cannot correct the, in my view,
egregious offense of burning American flags.    Q. How about the death
penalty for teen-agers and the retarded?    A. I really do have to leave.

<HEAD>The Universal Appeal of a Danish Prince</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to Shakespeare, ``Hamlet'' is still
very much the thing.
   In recent months, Britain's two large government-subsidized
theaters have tackled the Prince of Denmark, and two other London
plays are now on using Hamlet as a central character.
   It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and Hamlet's
celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese (``si
hai shi huo''), Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'') or English
(``To be or not to be'').
   In Paris, Patrice Chereau's production recently swept the Moliere
Awards, the French equivalent of Broadway's Tony. Britain has
averaged eight major ``Hamlet'' productions every year for the past
three years. New York's Public Theater presented it in 1986 with
Kevin Kline as the prince.
   Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress
Sarah Bernhardt a century ago, Dame Judith Andersonand more recently
Diane Venora at the Public in 1982.
   Laurence Olivier called it ``the best play ever written,'' and
his 1948 film portrayal was the only Shakespeare work ever to win
Academy Awards for best film and best actor.
   Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great
18th-century actor David Garrick hated the graveyard scene. ``I
swore,'' he said, ``that I would not leave the stage 'till I had
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.''
   The Victorians left out Hamlet's lapses into vernacular, along
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect
prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot
involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole,
much-applauded play by British dramatist Tom Stoppard about two
characters who find they do not exist outside the play.
   In 1987, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed production
with his Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm had a week-long run in
Britain, and in September Russian director Yuri Lyubimov will stage
``Hamlet'' with a British company at the Leicester Haymarket Theater.
   Drawn from Scandinavian legend, ``Hamlet'' is about a prince who
comes home from university to discover that his father has been
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the
queen he has widowed.
   Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of Denmark, Hamlet
plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched
poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by
dying in a sword fight.
   At its most basic, Hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be
reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over
the ages have seen Hamlet as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist,
militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of
action.
   This troubles some actors including Jonathan Pryce, who derides
what he calls the ``Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the
play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to
everything and everyone, ``Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in
particular.
   ``Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks
Lynne Truss in The Listener magazine. ``The answer seems to be that,
on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any
interpretation seems to be valid.''
   In recent years Londoners have been treated to Roger Rees' dry,
intensely cerebral Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company; Peter
Stormare's manic, military Hamlet for Ingmar Bergman; and now Daniel
Day-Lewis' highly emotional and impetuous Hamlet at the National.
   Richard Eyre's production continues the National's tradition of
doing a ``Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's
tenure. Day-Lewis, best known for the films ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``A Room With
a View,'' has inherited a part played in 1963 by Peter O'Toole and
in 1976 by Albert Finney.
   Also on show are Iris Murdoch's ``The Black Prince,'' adapted
from her 1973 novel, and the revival of Anton Chekhov's 1887
``Ivanov,'' with Alan Bates as a penniless landowner who sees
himself as a failed Hamlet figure.
   Murdoch, 69, first encountered Hamlet as a school text when she
was 15. She ``an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of
Bradley Pearson, the sardonic tax inspector of ``The Black Prince''
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of Hamlet.
   ``I became absolutely entranced by it and by Shakespeare
generally,'' she recalled in an interview. ``He's very good on
politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.''
   From Garrick and Henry Irving through John Barrymore, Olivier and
John Gielgud to today's acting generation, Hamlet remains the hurdle
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And
they rarely agree on whether Hamlet is an easy role or a difficult
one.
   ``It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which
adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues Michael
Pennington, who played the role in 1980 at Stratford.
   But Mark Rylance, who plays ``Hamlet'' in the Royal Shakespeare
Company's current Stratford production, disagrees.
   ``I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role,
it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. ``The
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot
of people cop out of that.''
   Eyre, 46, first directed ``Hamlet'' in an acclaimed London
production in 1980, then returned to the play intrigued by its
elasticity.
   ``I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing
up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over
the novel and films, too,'' he said.
   ``It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with,
a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off,
Hamlet is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince.
   ``This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of
Realpolitik.''

<HEAD>Grain Export Dispute Center of Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Top 10 grafs new with details of meeting; picks up pvs 8th graf,
The Australians say</HEAD>

   President Bush today welcomed Australian Prime
Minister Robert Hawke for talks focusing on the China crisis as well
as a thorny dispute between their countries over grain exports.
   The grain dispute, in which Australia claims that U.S. subsidies
to domestic growers are harmful to its markets, has settled into a
holding pattern. Both sides agree it should be decided at the
current round of trade liberalization talks now under way in Geneva,
said Acting Assistant Secretary of State William Clark.
   Clark told reporters after the president and Hawke met that the
two nations are in agreement that grain subsidies should be done
away with, but the Bush administration is unwilling to take such
steps until an agreement involving other countries is reached at the
international forum.
   In an arrival ceremony on the White House's South Lawn, Bush said
Australians and Americans share a ``pioneer heritage in the taming
of two vast continents, a heritage of democratic ideas and a
heritage of common sacrifice in war and common efforts in peace.''
   The two leaders discussed among other issues the current
repression in China, which the United States and Australia both have
condemned.
   Hawke later gave the president a strong vote of confidence during
a photo session in the Oval Office, saying that his views are
``identical'' to those of Bush in deploring and condemning ``the
barbarism'' of Beijing in violently suppressing the demonstrations
for democracy.
   However, he said, Australia shares the administration's concern
that it not take actions that would reverse China's economic reforms.
   While Bush did not publicly mention the agriculture dispute,
Hawke was outspoken in stating that he would bring up the matter.
   Australia dislikes the United States' Export Enhancement Program,
which provides subsidies to U.S. grain growers.
   Clark said the United States contends its subsidy program is
operated ``in a manner that doesn't harm traditional suppliers.''
   The Australians say the subsidy program has cut into their
exports to other markets and gives the U.S. growers an unfair price
advantage. The United States maintains the program is aimed at
countering only Europe's protectionist policies.
   The subject was a matter of some controversy during Vice
President Dan Quayle's recent visit to Australia.
   During the arrival ceremonies, Hawke addressed the matter saying,
``Mr. President, it is precisely because of the depth and the
maturity of our relationship that the difference of views that do
exist between us can be faced openly and honestly, for example, on
some trade matters particularly aspects of agricultural policy.''
   ``I am quite confident that today we will be able to focus on
ways to minimize, if not entirely resolve such differences.''
   Hawke said in a speech Monday in Washington that although damage
to Australia from the U.S. policy ``has lessened over the past year
or so, owing to lower world grain harvests and a running down of
stocks, there remains a danger that competitive expoert
subsidisation will agian damage Australia when grain surpluses
re-emerge.''
   In addition, Bush said the two leaders would discuss shares
strategic interests and Hawke's strong support for banning chemical
weapons, a position Bush strongly advocated during his presidential
campaign.
   ``You may be assured of our commitment to the early achievement
of an effectively verifiable treaty banning these weapons,'' Bush
said.
   He also hailed Australia's ``bold leadership in foreign policy,
both close to home and far from your shores. From the South Pacific
to Africa, Australia is a force for economic growth and a beacon of
democracy,'' Bush said.

   In Act III, scene 1 of Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,''
the tormented prince contemplates life and death. Brooding over his
uncle's usurpation of the throne and hasty marriage with his widowed
mother, he ponders whether or not he should kill the usurper _ or
himself.
   Hamlet reveals his thoughts to the audience, but not to the other
characters, in what is regarded as one of the most important
passages in drama.
   Just about every school child has at one point or another
memorized Hamlet's soliloquy, and actors throughout the world
explore its meaning in almost every language, including Chinese
(``si hai shi huo'') and Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'').

<HEAD>Second Nuclear Weapons Test in A Week Finally Detonated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAHUTE MESA, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear blast up to 12 times more
powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima rocked the desert this
morning in the second major U.S. weapons test in a week.
   The blast registered 4.6 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said spokesman John
Minsch.
   The test, code-named Amarillo, was deemed a success by the Energy
Department. Spokesman Jim Boyer said monitors indicated no leak of
radiation.
   The device was detonated 2,100 feet beneath the test range at
8:30 a.m. and had an explosive force of up to 150,000 tons of TNT.
The blast that destroyed Hiroshima had an explosive force of 13,000
tons of TNT.
   Ground zero was three miles from where a test code-named Contact
was conducted June 22. That blast measured 5.2 on the Richter scale.
   The test was scheduled for Saturday but was repeatedly delayed by
unfavorable wind. Tests are not conducted if winds are blowing
toward a populated area such as Las Vegas in case radiiation escapes
the underground cavity.
   Both devices were classified as having a range of between 20 and
150 kilotons, the upper limit allowed under treaties with the Soviet
Union.
   Today's test was believed to be near the upper limit. When a test
is conducted near the upper limits, the Energy Department announces
the blast in advance and warns managers of highrise buildings in Las
Vegas not to have workers in precarious positions.
   Today's test was the seventh announced blast of the year at the
Nevada Test Site and the 694th since testing began in Nevada in 1951.

<HEAD>Watermelon Production Making Comeback _ Maybe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department analysts say watermelons
may be making a comeback but have no first-hand figures to back it
up.
   That's because nobody at USDA has counted watermelons since 1981,
although the annual production of honeydew melons is reported
faithfully, including the number of acres planted and harvested,
along with the crop's yearly value.
   Watermelon output is probably four, five or six times that of
honeydew production, which is concentrated in Arizona, California
and Texas. Commercial watermelon farmers are reported in more than
two dozen states.
   ``I don't know why they aren't reported,'' says Gary Lucier of
the department's Economic Research Service. ``I asked that question,
too.''
   In a telephone interview on Monday, Lucier said production
information from the industry apparently will be relied upon heavily
as USDA develops a new marketing program financed by watermelon
growers and handlers.
   Lucier and Amy J. Allred, another economist, analyzed the U.S.
watermelon situation in a new report issued by the agency.
   ``Through 1980, U.S. production was trending downward and
domestic utilization was in a tailspin,'' the report said.
``Domestic watermelon production gradually fell from 29.3 million
hundredweight in 1960 to 26.1 million in 1981, the last year USDA
officially estimated production.''
   Although national figures from the department are lacking, some
states continue to report production. These show that production in
those states have increased one-fourth since 1981, including gains
in Florida, South Carolina and Arizona.
   ``Favorable grower prices have contributed to the gains,'' the
report said. ``In addition, available state production data show
that per capita (use) has increased one-fifth since the 1980 low.''
   Part of the per capita increase is due to an overall trend to
more fresh produce in diets, more watermelon imports and the
convenience of relatively new ``icebox'' and seedless melons _ plus
better produce marketing in retail stores.
   A major step was taken in February when commercial watermelon
growers and handlers voted in favor of a national promotion program
authorized by the 1985 farm law. The USDA is in the process of
writing final regulations and clearing the way for naming a
29-member National Watermelon Promotion Board.
   The board's program will be financed, beginning in 1990, by an
assessment on watermelons sold for human consumption. The levy can
be set at a rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds, paid by first
handlers and producers who grow five or more acres of melons.
   A grower who also is a handler would pay assessments for each
function. The fees are refundable upon request, but the National
Watermelon Association hopes the plan will raise $1 million annually.
   The association last week held its annual Watermelon Feast Day on
Capitol Hill and in the Agriculture Department itself, including the
appearance of this year's national watermelon queen, Jennifer Morris
of Southern Pines, N.C.
   According to the association, the U.S. watermelon industry _ with
a farm value of $160 million _ ``produces two billion or more pounds
of watermelon in nearly 30 states,'' led by Florida and followed by
Texas, Georgia, California, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama,
Indiana, Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Missouri, Maryland,
Delaware and Arkansas.

   An Agriculture Department report shows
vegetable processors have contracted for a sharply larger acreage
this year to help make up for 1988 drought-shriveled production.
   Overall, growers will have 1.41 million acres devoted to four
major vegetable crops in 1989, a 14 percent increase from last year
and 15 percent more than in 1987.
   ``Planted acreage of snap beans is up 22 percent; sweet corn is
up 8 percent; green peas jumped 15 percent; while tomatoes increased
17 percent,'' the report said Monday.
   Vegetables contracted for canning totaled 970,000 acres,
including tomatoes, a 13 percent increase. Freezers contracted
441,000 acres, up 17 percent.
   Reduced production last year because of drought helped boost
vegetable prices sharply, including further rises in the first
quarter of 1989, according to department economists. Consumer food
prices generally this year are expected to rise an average of 4
percent to 7 percent, compared with a rise in 1988 of 4.1 percent.
   The retail price of processed vegetables by themselves rose an
average of 4.8 percent in 1988, compared with a 2.8 percent increase
in 1987. This year, according to USDA economists, consumer prices of
processed vegetables are expected to be 8 percent to 10 percent
higher.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says that
if all requests he receives were honored the federal budget deficit
would be two or three times its current level of more than $150
billion.
   Yeutter told a meeting of the American Seed Trade Association
that around 75 percent of his mail comes from people asking for more
federal assistance of some kind.
   ``Most of these letters are coming from members of Congress, of
course, reflecting concerns of their constitutents,'' he said. ``If
the government were to honor all of those pleas for additional
funding, that ... $150 billion deficit that we have now would
probably double or treble, just based on agricultural requests
alone, aside from what the rest of the economy is asking for.''
   Yeutter said there are many views as to whether American farmers
have become addicted to federal subsidies. He said his home state of
Nebraska last year had a net farm income of ``something over $2
billion,'' of which more than $1 billion came from the government.
   ``That's pretty addictive,'' he said.

   A Belgian air force colonel accused of
giving top secret Belgian and NATO documents to the Soviet Union was
convicted of treason Tuesday and sentenced to 20 years at hard labor.
   Col. Guy Binet was sentenced by the military court to 20 years at
hard labor and discharged from the armed forces. He could have
received life imprisonment, but the prosecutor had asked for a
15-year sentence.
   Binet, 54, had given secret Belgian and NATO military documents
for which he received the equivalent of $105,000, according to
testimony at the trial, which began earlier this month.
   Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme said at the time of Binet's
arrest in September 1980 that the colonel was driven by profit
motives rather than ideological reasons.
   Binet's lawyers argued that he did not act for money, that the
sum he received had been placed in a bank in Luxembourg and turned
over to Belgian authorities.
   Binet began spying for the Soviet Union in 1986, Coeme said, but
an investigation revealed the first contact with Soviet agents took
place three years earlier.

   Laboring under U.S. and British threats to boycott the Moscow
conference if sufficient progress in human rights is not made, the
Soviet delegation tried to dispel doubts about its sincerity.
   The month-long Conference on the Human Dimension, which ended
Friday, was the first of three on human rights held in the framework
of the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   Ambassador Yuri B. Kashlev said his delegation held more than 100
meetings with journalists and human rights groups, assuring a high
profile and an ``open and straightforward position'' that ``drew
positive response.''
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze set the tone in a speech May
30 at the 35-nation forum, saying the affirmation of individual
rights should be the objective of all countries.
   A Soviet official later paid his nation's first clear homage to
Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews
in Hungary in World War II, then disappeared after being arrested by
occupying Soviet forces.
   ``We profoundly regret the death of this noble person,'' said
Vladimir Andreyev of the Soviet prosecutor's office. Wallenberg's
fate, he said, ``is a somber page in our history.''
   Over the following month, the affable Soviet delegation laid on
news conferences and opened its doors to special interest groups
with grievances about human rights abuses in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets deny they fear a U.S. boycott of the Moscow meeting
and say their attitude reflects the fruits of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies of social and economic reforms.
   ``It's not an artificial thing,'' said Kashlev. ``Even before the
decision on the Moscow conference, we were the same open people ...
It's not just a trick to persuade somebody.''
   The United States agreed to attend the Moscow conference ``in the
expectation that progress in human rights would continue'' and that
free access by protest groups be guaranteed, said a ranking member
of the U.S. delegation, who asked not to be identified.
   ``We have agreed ... and we're planning to go,'' he said. ``But
we would have a very hard time sending a delegation if things moved
backward.''
   ``The decision has been taken,'' said the Soviet ambassador.
``There is no force in the world that will stop it (the Moscow
conference) from being held.''
   With or without the Americans, ``the process of democratization
will continue,'' Kashlev said.
   ``It's not because of their pressure. It's our own internal
development. It's Gorbachev who does this, not Mr. Abram,'' he said
of Morris B. Abram, head of the U.S. delegation in Paris.
   The stakes for Moscow are high. Holding the third conference
there amounts to an affirmation of Soviet compliance with the
principles of the Helsinki Final Act subscribed to by the nations of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The conference
includes all European nations except Albania, as well as the United
States and Canada.
   The three human rights conferences were decided on at the close
of a January meeting in Vienna. The second conference will be held
next year in Copenhagen, and a final meeting is scheduled for
Helsinki in 1992.
   The United States and West European nations have acknowledged
broad Soviet progress in human rights under Gorbachev.
   While East bloc allies Romania and Bulgaria were criticized for
human rights abuses, the Soviet Union was praised for progress and a
new spirit of cooperation.
   ``The Soviets have taken some comfort that they are not the
worst,'' said the U.S. delegate. They have used a
``non-confrontational, more tolerant approach than we've seen
before,'' he said.
   ``For quite a long time, our position was `hands off _ it's our
internal affair,''' Kashlev said. ``We have changed completely, much
more than the West.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Remedial Action to Open Suburban Housing to
Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered local, state and federal
agencies to expand efforts to open suburban Boston housing to black
families.
   Ruling in a lawsuit filed 11 years ago, U.S. District Judge
Walter J. Skinner ordered the state to give the Boston Fair Housing
Commission authority to issue subpoenas, levy fines and start civil
actions to attack discrimination.
   Skinner agreed with the charge in the lawsuit by the Boston NAACP
that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development failed to
use its grant programs to produce an adequate supply of affordable
integrated family housing in the metropolitan area.
   Skinner's findings dealt with HUD practices between 1977 to 1982.
But he wrote, ``The conditions, exacerbated by HUD's pattern of
inaction, apparently continue to exist and are currently
remediable.''
   The ruling, made public Monday, is a ``blockbuster _ a whole new
world,'' said Dianne Wilkerson of the Boston chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``This ruling
changes life for minorities in Boston in some very major ways. This
is just amazing.''
   HUD spokeswoman Jacqueline Roundtree said the department had not
decided whether to appeal.
   The ruling orders HUD and the state to require owners of all
government-assisted housing in metropolitan Boston to participate
fully in anti-discrimination programs. It also orders Boston to
create a clearinghouse with a list of federally assisted housing
units.
   In 1985, Skinner dismissed the lawsuit, saying he lacked
authority to review and correct HUD practices. In 1987, an appeals
court said Skinner did have authority and ordered him to reopen the
case.

   Mormons today dedicated a $1 million shrine
in the old jail where a mob 145 years ago killed church founder
Joseph Smith and his brother.
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson, Gov. James R. Thompson
and more than 3,000 others attended ceremonies marking the end of a
restoration project at the site considered sacred by the world's 6.5
million Mormons.
   Gordon Hinckley, first counselor to Benson, recalled the shooting
of Smith and his brother, Hyrum, on June 27, 1844 as part of an
``epic story of martyrdom.''
   ``Few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood
stained the floor of this jail,'' Hinckley said. ``We are grateful
for the reconciliation that has come with the passage of time.''
   The jail has been restored to its 1844 appearance. A statue of
the Smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotations from
Joseph Smith also were unveiled.
   The former jail's renovation was completed to coincide with the
150th anniversary of the Mormons' settlement in the Mississippi
River town of Nauvoo, 200 miles north of St. Louis.
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints envisioned the
town as its home. But non-believers persecuted the Mormons over
Smith's claims that he had spoken with God.
   ``Joseph and Hyrum were summoned to Carthage to stand trial and
were being held at the jail when they were murdered by the mob. It
is a sacred place to us,'' said Loren C. Dunn, president of the
restoration project.
   Two years later, Brigham Young led church followers to their
eventual home in Salt Lake City. The church is spending $20 million
to uncover church roots in Illinois and restore the settlement at
Nauvoo, now a town of 1,100 people.

<TEXT>
   An American free-lance photographer
said Tuesday he was chained and handcuffed after his arrest by
Afghan security forces 19 days ago.
   Tony O'Brien, accompanied by police and agents of the Afghan
secret police, told a news conference that authorities have treated
him well since then.
   His comments came as a U.S. official arrived from India to
negotiate his release.
   O'Brien, 43, of Santa Fe, N.M., said Afghan officials told him he
would be tried for entering the country without a valid travel
document. The charge carries a prison term of five to 10 years.
   Looking relaxed and smiling at the Kabul Press Club, O'Brien
apologized to the government for entering Afghanistan without a visa.
   ``I really want to thank the Afghan government,'' he said at the
news conference, which was videotaped by Afghan television. ``I know
I have broken the laws of the country ... I apologize for that.''
   O'Brien said he was not pressured to make statements. ``I was
told that journalists wanted to meet me,'' he said. ``I was asked if
I was willing.''
   O'Brien said he was handcuffed and chained when arrested June 8
in Kabul, but since then, ``They have really treated me well, I did
not expect this.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said O'Brien had
entered Afghanistan six times in the company of the U.S.-backed
Moslem guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet Kabul government. O'Brien
nodded.
   Journalists enter Afghanistan with the Pakistan-based guerrillas
because the government in the past had refused visas to many Western
journalists. But the government opened up its doors in June 1988,
and 1,200 foreign journalists have entered the country with valid
visas since then.
   At least three Western journalists and two foreign aid workers
have been captured while traveling with guerrillas during the
decade-long civil war. All were released unharmed. O'Brien is the
first American captured.
   O'Brien is a free-lance photographer with the Picture Group photo
agency and was on assignment for Life magazine when arrested.
O'Brien's photos from previous visits to Afghanistan have appeared
in major U.S. publications.
   Renny Smith, a consular officer from the U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi, arrived in Kabul on Tuesday to negotiate O'Brien's release.

<HEAD>Official Says Jailed Financier Will Fight Extradition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi says he
will fight extradition to the United States, where he is accused of
helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos hide stolen wealth, a Swiss
official reported Tuesday.
   Marcos and his wife are accused in New York of stealing more than
$100 million in Philippine government money to buy real estate and
art objects before he was ousted as president in February 1986.
Khashoggi allegedly posed as the owner of some assets.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Ursula Riedel said Khashoggi was
asked, after a U.S. request arrived May 31, whether he would agree
to extradition.
   He refused and his attorneys are expected to provide an formal
explanation by next week, after which Swiss authorities will rule on
the extradition request, she told The Associated Press.
   No decision is expected until mid-July and Khashoggi's lawyers
have said they will appeal any ruling against him to the Federal
Tribunal, Switzerland's Supreme Court.
   Khashoggi, known for his middleman role in the Iran-Contra
affair, was arrested by Swiss police in April at the request of the
U.S. Embassy. It appears almost certain he will spend his 54th
birthday, July 25, in a Bern jail.
   A U.S. district court in New York indicted Khashoggi, the
Marcoses, five other people and a California bank last October.
   The financier is charged with racketeering, conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and mail fraud. Racketeering alone carries a
prison term of up to 20 years.
   Marcos was president of the Philippines for 20 years. The
government of President Corazon Aquino, swept to power by a
civilian-military uprising that drove Marcos into exile, accuses him
of stealing billions of dollars in public funds.

   Authorities are stepping up their

   Five people have died of the disease in Czechoslovakia and
another 145 have tested positive for it, the report said.
   The report, quoting data submitted to the recent World Conference

   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.

``If I think it's not going the way I would like for it to go.''

   Scarlet ribbon stretched across James P. Brawley

   The cutting of the ribbon across the street between the schools
Monday signaled the formation of a new institution _ Clark Atlanta
University.
   ``The significant history in this consolidation is what (the
institutions) bring to the table at this critical point in the life

   The boards of trustees of the two institutions voted to
consolidate more than a year ago.

College, founded in 1869.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Party chief F.W. de
Klerk said Tuesday that European leaders he met on a recent tour
understand South Africa must go through a gradual process of reform.
   De Klerk, designated the next president of South Africa,
indicated that international pressure and economic sanctions on his
country may ease ``as long as it is visible that we're really
working towards a negotiation situation.''
   At the airport news conference, de Klerk did not say how he
planned to engage leaders of the disenfranchised black majority in
negotiations to end the apartheid system of race discrimination.
   He said he gave ``no concrete agenda'' to leaders he met in
Britain, West Germany, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland and the Vatican.
   ``Neither I, nor those whom I had discussions with, attempted to
make unrealistic demands or create unrealistic expectations,'' de
Klerk said.
   His overall impression from the tour ``is that there is
realization that what happens here must be step-by-step and that
there is realization that to really have successful renewal and
change in South Africa which will not affect the stability of this
country the first step is to broaden and intensify the base of
discussions as a phase even before what one could call a real
negotiation phase.''
   Opponents say Pretoria uses minor reforms to shield itself
against criticism and delay the advent of black rule in South Africa.
   At nearly every stop on his European tour, de Klerk was asked
about the release of Nelson Mandela, leader of the outlawed African
National Congress, who has been imprisoned since 1962 under a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Asked about Mandela on Tuesday, de Klerk referred to the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections, after which he is expected to succeed
President P.W. Botha.
   ``I want to win the election for my party and I wouldn't like to
make particular statements as to what I, in whatever position one
might be, will particularly do afterward,'' de Klerk said,
indicating Mandela's release would lose him votes among right-wing
whites.
   Botha suffered a stroke this year and has said he will retire
after the elections.
   Also on Tuesday, West German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said he
had a tough encounter with Botha, with the president refusing to
discuss condemned prisoners or allow him to visit Mandela.
   Instead, Bluem said, Botha briefed him on economic progress in
South Africa.
   Bluem said he replied that human rights are not determined by
``improved living standards alone. A man does not live on bread
alone.'' Bluem said Botha answered that ``he (Botha) will decide
which position is the right one.''
   When Bluem asked to see Mandela, Botha referred him to the
minister of justice, who was not on the West German's itinerary.

<TEXT>
   The head of the National Council of Churches
announced his resignation today in a dispute over the future of the
country's biggest ecumenical organization.
   The Rev. Arie R. Brouwer, general secretary of the council since
1985, said the organization is not ready to pursue the unifying
goals he set for it.
   ``The time is not ripe for it,'' he said in announcing he will
step down on Friday.
   The council, which includes most major Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox churches in the country, has been enmeshed in controversy
for three years over departmental accountability and authority, as
well as financial difficulties.
   Brouwer, who came close to being dismissed a month ago, had
pressed for closer integration of various council units against
stiff resistance by some officials.
   Their ``dream was different than mine,'' he said.
   Brouwer, 53, a Reformed Church in America clergyman, said the
rupture was clarified for him by a 57-57 vote over a move to dismiss
him at the council's governing board meeting in Lexington, Ky., last
month.
   Since the vote, pressure for Brouwer to step down continued.
   ``I will be in prayer and fasting over the days and weeks to
come,'' Brouwer had said after the vote.
   Brouwer riled some board members with a scathing report in
Lexington, saying recent months had been ``a crucifixion, a journey
through hell.''
   He said the ecumenical atmosphere has been fouled with ``rumors,
innuendo and false charges ... poured forth from the bureaucratic
rumor mill,'' public media and religious press. Defending his own
leadership style, he said:
   ``The problem is that I have dared to speak the truth to the will
to power. ... The powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and
they are outraged. They will not have it.''
   The main conflict had come over moves to make the council a more
united body functioning as a ``communion of communions,'' with each
department sharing proportionately in central administrative costs.
   That system was strongly resisted by Church World Service, the
council's relief arm and financially biggest operation. The service
had operated somewhat independently and with its own revenues.
   A furor developed in mid-1988 when the service's executive, the
Rev. J. Richard Butler, resigned because of conflict with Brouwer
over integrating the service more closely with other council units.
   As a result of the internal stress, general recommedations of a
reorganizational committee were approved at the Lexington meeting,
consolidating the council's 11 units into four.
   Measures that would give member denominations more direct
oversight of the council units were part of the plan, specifics of
which were to be worked out in September.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a black
audience today that the Bush administration won't pursue legislation
to overturn recent Supreme Court decisions on civil rights.
   However, Thornburgh said he would monitor implementation of the
rulings and take ``any legislative or executive action that might be
required to resolve inequities.''
   ``The pursuit and promotion of civil rights in America is more
than a legal obligation, it is a moral imperative embodied in our
national sense of fairness and justice,'' Thornburgh told the annual
convention of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group founded by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   The high court, adopting some positions advocated by the Justice
Department under the Reagan administration, has restricted
affirmative action programs and made it more difficult for
plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace.
   The decisions have prompted calls from some lawmakers to consider
legislation to overturn the rulings.
   President Bush told a news conference today his advisers
concluded that none of the rulings has jeopardized the principles of
equal opportunity for all Americans. He said if the court's
decisions turn out to hamper civil rightrs enforcement, he would
consider legislation.
   Thornburgh, in his first public pronouncement on the
controversial cases, said some viewed the decisions ``as a retreat
in the battle for civil rights.''
   But, Thornburgh asked, do ``these decisions ... stand in conflict
with this nation's fundamental commitment to ensure the provision of
civil rights of all Americans? Or do these decisions represent
attempts by the court to fine-tune the complexities of enforcement
of civil rights law in America?''
   Thornburgh said the effect of the rulings would not be felt until
they are applied in new cases, but that President Bush had asked him
to monitor their implementation.
   ``This responsibility is one I take very seriously and one that
the Department of Justice will approach consistent with our
commitment to the goals of fairness and equality in our quest for
equal opportunity,'' Thornburgh said.
   During a discussion following the speech, several panelists
expressed disappointment that Thornburgh didn't favor immediate
legislation to overturn the high court rulings.
   ``In the past six days, the Supreme Court has basically repealed
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,'' said Julius Chambers,
director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.
   ``It disappoints us, to put it mildly, to suggest that we must
now wait to see how these decisions work in practice.''
   ``We ask the administration to express the same reverence for
equal opportunity'' as for the American flag, said employment rights
lawyer Nancy Creiter, referring to President Bush's proposal for a
constitutional amendment to overturn the high court's legalization
of flag burning.
   Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, an umbrella group of civil rights organizations
nationwide, had said the administration's response would be an
important test.
   ``President Bush has repeatedly stated his commitment to civil
rights and to minority outreach efforts. However, a decision to
oppose legislation to overturn the recent Supreme Court decisions
would be completely incompatible with such a commitment,'' Neas said
before Thornburgh's speech.
   ``Indeed, remedial legislation has become the No. 1 priority for
everyone committed to equal employment opportunity for all
Americans,'' Neas said.
   Thornburgh spoke at the invitation of Jackson, who hailed the
attorney general's commitment to civil rights after the two met at
the Justice Departent last winter.
   ``The lights have been turned back on in the Justice Department
and hopefully the dust will be cleared from the books,'' Jackson
told reporters that day. He was referring to the Reagan
administration's civil rights record, which was roundly criticized
by black leaders.
   As he did after the meeting with Jackson, Thornburgh has
repeatedly expressed commitment to ``the full enforcement of civl
rights laws ... and the full enjoyment of equal opportunity by all
of its citizens.''
   But the attorney general has conceded he may have differences
with civil rights leaders about achieving those goals.
   William Lucas, whose nomination to head the Justice Department's
civil rights division has split the civil rights lobby, was
accompanying Thornburgh to the convention.
   A black Republican from Michigan, Lucas' nomination is opposed by
several organizations who contend he lacks the necessary legal
experience to be the Justice Department's civil rights chief.
   But Jackson and other black leaders have expressed support,
albeit muted in some cases, for the Lucas nomination.

<HEAD>Party Session Opens in Bucharest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Romanian Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee convened Tuesday in Bucharest to
discuss the upcoming 14th Party Congress in November, the official
Agerpres news agency said.
   The two-day meeting, chaired by party leader Nicolae Ceausescu,
will discuss ``directives regarding Romania's socio-economic
development in the 1991-95 five-year period, as well as long-term
guidelines until 2000-2010,'' the news agency said.
   The meeting also will approvie programs on the ``development of
revolutionaty worker's democracy, the growing role of the Romanian
Communist Party in ideological and political activity ... and the
fundamental characteristics of the present international
situation,'' Agerpres said.
   The meeting is the first since Romania in April made a surprise
announcement that it managed to pay off a foreign debt which in 1981
stood at $11 billion.
   The price, however, was steep. For nearly a decade, communist
authorities sharply rationed food, gasoline, electricity and other
essentials. Dissent over government policy was suppressed by one of
the world's most efficient police forces.
   Now that the debt is paid off, there is no word yet whether this
will translate into better lives for Romanians.
   Western commercial officials said in addition to the traditional
problems encountered in trading with a centralized economy, Romanian
industry has been starved of investments and is plagued with
breakdowns and supply problems.
   Romanian economists said Bucharest would like to expand its trade
with developing countries by offering better financing.
   The session would also discuss Romania's stand on foreign policy
developments prior to next week's Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest,
which will draw the East bloc's party general secretaries, including
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Eight women arrested for baring their
breasts on a city beach pleaded innocent Tuesday, saying a state law
that permits men to go shirtless discriminates against women.
   Ten women were charged on Saturday with exposure of person, a
violation under state law. Two defendants did not enter pleas and
were rescheduled to appear Wednesday.
   The women, dubbed the Topfree 10, said the state law that permits
men to go shirtless in public is unconstitutional because it
discriminates against women.
   ``Because the law is unjust, I plead not guilty,'' Kathie Reilly
told Judge John Manning Regan in Rochester City Court. He scheduled
a pre-trial conference for Aug. 1.
   The women are repeating a 1986 protest, in which seven women were
arrested in a city park for going topless and spent a week in court
trying to convince a judge that the state nudity law is unfair.
   In 1986, Judge Herman Walz dismissed the charges against the
women, saying they were expressing their right to free speech by
exposing their breasts as a form of protest.
   The women have been having ``Topfree Equality Picnics'' for the
past four years. In 1987 and 1988 they were not arrested.

<HEAD>Bush Advises Gorbachev Not To Be Uptight About His East European
Trip</HEAD>

   President Bush said Tuesday he would not exhort
the Polish and Hungarian people on his visit to their countries next
month to take actions that might invite repression. Bush said there
was no reason for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to get
``uptight'' about the trip.
   ``I want to see a much more open Europe,'' Bush said. ``And I
think that the importance of the visit is along that line. It's not
going to be that we're going to solve the problem of the Hungarian
economy or the Polish economy.''
   At a wide-ranging news conference, Bush took a relaxed view of
U.S.-Soviet competition and Gorbachev's own travels to the West. For
instance, Bush said, ``it was a good thing'' that the Soviet leader
went to West Germany earlier this month.
   ``It's a good thing for him to go to Western Europe, and it's a
good thing for the president of the United States to go to Eastern
Europe,'' Bush said. ``I want to see us move beyond containment.''
   Bush will visit Poland July 9-11, stopping both in the capital,
Warsaw, and in Gdansk, the port city on the Baltic where the
Solidarity labor movement spurred economic and political change in
the Communist government.
   Bush will go on from there to Budapest, the capital of Hungary,
for a July 11-13 visit also designed to accelerate economic and
political change in the most liberal of the Soviet Union's East
European allies.
   He will be the third U.S. president to visit the region while in
the White House. The others were Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter.
   Bush said he would bring an economic package to Poland and had
discussed U.S. legislation to carry out the undisclosed plan with
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. However, the president stressed U.S. support for the
Polish economy would require further reforms there.
   In any event, Bush said in regard to both Poland and Hungary that
``being there is the significant thing. It is important that the
United States show its interest in these countries that are
undergoing change. You don't want to overexhort. You don't want to
overpromise. You don't want to rally people to levels of political
activity that might cause repression.''
   At the same time, Bush said the trip, which precedes his
participation in an economic summit meeting in Paris with the
leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West Germany and Japan,
was not designed to send a signal to Moscow.
   ``I would not expect them to be uptight about it,'' Bush said.
``Mr. Gorbachev goes to Western Europe and is well-received. And I
will go to Eastern Europe and I will be well-received.''
   The pace of change in both Poland and Hungary has accelerated
since Bush scheduled his trip.
   Solidarity has won 99 of 100 Senate seats in two rounds of
elections as well as all the contested races for the lower house. In
Hungary, the Communist leadership chose as party chairman Rezsoe
Nyers, a prominent advocate of democratic change, and appointed him
to a new four-man ruling body dominated by such advocates.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
developments in both countries were welcomed and unlikely to affect
Bush's trip much. However, the official said, there is ``a lot of
nervousness'' in Poland about whom Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
likely president in a new government, will appoint to be prime
minister.
   ``It's the sort of thing that happens when you get into a
democratic system,'' the official said. ``Democracy is less tidy.
And yet, we're relaxed about this.''
   In Hungary, he said, the changes were expected. ``The reform
elements are clearly more in control,'' the official said. ``The
situation looks like it will be relatively stable at least until the
party congress'' in the fall.
   Bush described his intentions in the two countries this way:
   ``What I want to do is make clear where the United States stands
in terms of our respect for freedom, encourage reform as much as
possible, and then offer some specifics where we can help on the
economy. ...
   We will support those that move toward us economically,
politically and in terms of human rights. And it's more on those
general themes that I will be talking to the Hungarian leaders and
the Polish leaders.''

<TEXT>
   The military government has ordered six
universities closed for a year because of student involvement in
riots that left 43 people dead.
   Two other universities will remain closed until the beginning of
the next school year, Sept. 30, according to Education Minister
Jubril Aminu.
   This month, 23 universities and vocational colleges were shut
temporarily after riots by students and others opposed to the
austerity measures imposed by the government.
   The government has refused to retreat from the austerity program,
which was required by Western creditors, but it announced a package
of relief measures, including some pay increases.
   The universities ordered closed for one year were in Lagos,
Benin, Ibadan, Ekpoma and Okigwe.
   Students attending the universities that remain open will be
required to sign an agreement to remain on good behavior and to pay
for damage to university property, Aminu said in his announcement
Monday night.

   The owner of a fireworks company says
he plans to set off two tons of explosives during an Independence
Day display for President Bush.
   ``We're showing off our best, simply speaking,'' said George
Zambelli, who was hired by an anonymous benefactor.
   The 15-minute presidential pyrotechnics performance will be held
next Monday at Bush's seaside home at Walkers Point. Bush is
scheduled to arrive here Friday and stay through July 5.
   Zambelli, whose family has been setting off fireworks in the
United States since 1893, said the show will use about two tons of
fireworks and go beyond what the donor has paid for.
   Zambelli said his business, Zambelli Internationale, is no

   The State Department on Tuesday renewed its
appeal to leftist rebels in El Salvador to negotiate with the
government to end the 9-year-old old civil war.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has formed a national
commission to talk to the FMLN guerrilla movement.
   ``We urge the FMLN to stop the killing and talk to the
commission,'' said department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Her statement was prompted in part by the assassination of a
retired army colonel who had served as head of the Public Security
Academy. An FMLN death squad had admitted responsibility for the
killing, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The nation's attorney general and the minister of the presidency
also were slain recently.
   ``In those cases, the FMLN denied responsibility but other
observers, including President Cristiani, believe them to be the
perpetrators,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

   A prematurely dropped anchor may have
contributed to an 800,000-gallon oil spill in the Delaware River
that had hundreds of workers today gathering blobs of ``black
Jell-O'' that mechanical skimmers couldn't suck up.
   The spill was one of three that occurred in U.S. waters over the
weekend.
   More civilian and military workers were pressed into service this
morning to clean up the Delaware oil, and the state sued in federal
court to recover damages from the owners of the Uruguayan tanker
that caused the spill.
   In Texas, Tropical Storm Allison slowed the cleanup of a
240,000-gallon spill in the Houston Ship Channel. Off Rhode Island,
most of the estimated 420,000 gallons of oil from a grounded Greek
tanker no longer threatened the shore.
   Officials in charge of the Delaware cleanup were concerned about
a forecast for 95-degree heat, which could liquefy the oil.
   ``When we've got it in chunks, we can pick it up; when it's
flowing, you can't pick it up with a pitchfork,'' said Coast Guard
Capt. Larry Murdock.
   More than 500 people, including 300 Delaware National Guardsmen,
and 22 boats were involved in the cleanup today. In Philadelphia,
Coast Guard spokesman David Oney said this morning that Delaware was
sending 150 more Guardsmen.
   ``So far, we've recovered 63,826 gallons from the spill,'' Oney
said.
   In the search for the causes of the spills, two Coast Guard
hearings began this morning.
   In Texas, the pilot of the tanker Rachel-B, which collided with
an oil barge owned by Coastal Towing Co. of Houston, testified that
he was unable to make a proper turn from the Bayport Channel into
the Houston Ship Channel.
   ``It could have been caused by too much sediment in the
channel,'' pilot Michael Gale said.
   In Providence, R.I., Capt. David G. Leonard, a harbor pilot,
testified that he radioed three warnings to the tanker that ran
aground but could not be certain the message was received.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete testified that he asked the tanker captain,
Iakovos Georgoudis, ``Why were you in that location which requires a
pilot to be on board?''
   ``He said, `That was my mistake,''' DiPrete said. ``He made no
bones about it.''
   Coast Guard Capt. Eric Williams said no evidence of mechanical
failure had been found.
   Along 20 miles of the Delaware River, workers in boats scooped up
blobs of congealed oil larger than basketballs, stuffing the goo
into large trash bags. Skimmers dispatched after the Uruguayan
tanker Presidente Rivera ran aground Saturday jammed in the dense
oil blobs.
   ``It's like black Jell-O, it's horrible,'' said Joseph Monigle of
New Castle, Del., as he watched workers from the shore.
   A lawyer representing the insurance company covering the
Presidente Rivera says the spill was caused by the crew dropping
anchor prematurely as the ship prepared to dock at the Sun Oil
terminal in Marcus Hook, Pa.
   Attorney A. Robert Degen said after the ship swung around to pick
up the anchor, ``the decision was made to turn the ship around and
head to Marcus Hook. In the course of turning the ship around, the
bow struck the bottom.''
   Coast Guard officials scheduled a hearing Wednesday in
Philadelphia on the spill.
   Federal officials said shoreline damage in Pennsylvania and
Delaware was light because the oil congealed instead of spreading
across the surface of the water. Winds and tides spared New Jersey.
   Delaware Fish and Wildlife officers found about 25 Canada geese
soaked with oil Monday near the mouth of the Christiana River, which
feeds the Delaware River, Coast Guard spokesman David Oney said.
   In Rhode Island, there had been some reports of lobsters killed
and several small birds found dead, but officials said those did not
appear to be widespread. Some state beaches were being reopened
today.
   A statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect, and seafood
prices increased. Ron Pariseau, manager of Handrigan Seafood, said
wholesale steamer claims jumped from $55 to $85 a bushel during the
past week, while flounder went from 40 cents to 95 cents a pound. At
retail, flounder filets that cost $4.49 a pound 10 days ago were
selling for $5.99 a pound.
   No more than five percent of the oil that spilled from the World
Prodigy after it hit a reef remained floating, officials said Monday.
   ``The worst is over,'' said Debbie Payton of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. ``There's not going to
be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the beginning.''
   In Texas, the storm slowed the cleanup, but workers have been
able to collect nearly 4,000 or the 6,000 barrels of oil.
   In Washington, a spokesman for President Bush accused the oil
industry of moving too slowly on oil-spill cleanup technology and
said the three spills highlight ``the pervasiveness of the problem.''
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration has proposed legislation to give tanker owners
``first level of responsibility'' for paying cleanup costs. He ruled
out a moratorium on new oil drilling and exploration.

<HEAD>Diplomat Willie Star, Found on Guam, Puzzled by Fuss over Whereabouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie Star, the roving ambassador from Nauru,
was found Tuesday on the U.S. territory of Guam and seemed puzzled
by the recent hullabaloo in the State Department over his supposed
disappearance.
   T.W. Star, known to his friends as Willie, is officially listed
as ambassador to the United States from Nauru, a tiny island
republic in the western Pacific, but hasn't been seen in Washington
since he presented his diplomatic credentials to President Carter
nine years ago.
   The State Department had been sending letters and diplomatic
cables for several weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to find Star _
rumored to be living in Australia or the Philippines _ to determine
whether he's interested in becoming dean of the diplomatic corps, a
ceremonial post traditionally held by the senior resident ambassador
in Washington.
   Finally, on Tuesday, an Associated Press reporter in Honolulu
located Star by telephone at the Pacific Star Hotel on Guam in the
western Pacific, where he said he has served as Nauru's consul
general for the past year.
   He sounded puzzled over the State Department's search for him.
   Asked if he is still the U.S. ambassador from Nauru, Star
replied: ``I don't think so. I don't know. I'll have to talk to my
government.'' Then he hung up.
   Larry Dunham of the State Department's diplomatic and consular
section laughed when informed of Star's whereabouts. As small
nations sometimes do, he said, Nauru had failed to follow the
customary practice of informing the State Department of a consular
appointment.
   ``This is unusual, but everything about this case has been
unusual,'' Dunham said.
   Ordinarily, he said, foreign governments inform the State
Department of consular appointments through their embassy in
Washington, but Nauru does not maintain an embassy here. Star's
wife, reached by telephone Tuesday in Guam, said her husband had
never lived in Washington.
   Star's presence on Guam apparently also went unnoticed because
the territory's affairs are administered by the Interior Department.
The State Department has no representative on Guam.
   Mrs. Star, speaking to a reporter in her husband's absence
Tuesday, said Star previously had served as Nauru's consul general
in Melbourne, Australia, and the Philippines capital of Manila
before he was moved to Guam about a year ago.
   The State Department's manhunt for Star began shortly after the
retirement last month of Sweden's popular ambassador, Wilhelm
Wachtmeister, who had been dean of the diplomatic corps for three
years.
   Under protocol rules, the honorary post goes to the foreign
ambassador with the most seniority in Washington, based on the date
the envoy's credentials were presented to the U.S. president.
   The dean, who receives no extra pay, represents other ambassadors
at ceremonial functions and in dealings with the host government
over diplomatic immunity, parking privileges and other collective
concerns.
   After Wachtmeister retired, the deanship passed to the next
eligible ambassador, Andrew Jacovides of Cyprus, who was promptly
summoned home for a foreign ministry job. Next in line was Turkey's
Sukru Elekdag, but he is retiring. Then the State Department turned
to Star, the ambassador from Nauru who had been doubling as consul
general in Melbourne.
   A letter was dispatched to Star via the U.S. Embassy in Canberra,
Australia, informing him of his opportunity to become dean of the
diplomatic corps provided he takes up residence in Washington.
   Star never responded. The embassy had no luck finding him.
   Stan Ifshin, a State Department desk officer for Pacific island
affairs, said that the department will await clarification from
Nauru about whether Star is still U.S. ambassador. ``I don't believe
he is,'' Ifshin said.
   If Star doesn't take the deanship, it probably will go to the
ambassador from Cape Verde, an island republic in the Atlantic off
the West African coast.

<HEAD>Judges Adhering to Federal Guidelines, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges are adhering to federal guidelines
designed to end disparities in criminal sentences, the chairman of
the U.S. Sentencing Commission said Tuesday.
   More than 82 percent of the sentences handed down by federal
judges fall within the guidelines in effect since Nov. 1, 1987,
William Wilkins said at a news conference.
   He said his conclusions were based on a random sample of 25
percent of the guideline cases handled over a 16-month period ending
March 31.
   More than 9 percent of the sentences were below the guidelines
and nearly 3 percent above it, he said, adding that more than 5
percent fell below the guidelines because defendants provided
substantial assistance to the government.
   Wilkins, a federal appeals court judge, said the system was
working well and represented ``a dramatic improvement'' over earlier
sentencing.
   The commission was established because federal judges were giving
widely different sentences for similar crimes. The law enacted by
Congress in setting up the panel mandated that defendants convicted
of similar crimes receive similar sentences.
   ``Critics have predicted that guideline sentencing would bring
the justice system to its knees, inducing an avalanche of trials by
defendants who previously would have pleaded guilty,'' Wilkins said.
   However, he said, more than 90 percent of the more than 7,000
defendants sentenced under the guidelines pleaded guilty.

   Hundreds of Cambodian refugees who fled
a camp controlled by communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas will be
returned to the Khmer Rouge, a Thai security official said today.
   In Washington, however, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said the Thai government confirmed to U.S. officials that
the refugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistance
camps.
   She said the action followed strong appeals from U.S. officials
to the Thai government that the refugees not be placed back under
Khmer Rouge control because their safety could not be assured.
   ``The United States goverment continues to be strongly opposed to
the return of these Cambodians to Khmer Rouge control,'' she said.
   The estimated 600 refugees now are in a camp run by the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   The Khmer Rouge, widely accused of human rights violations in
areas under their control, have asked that the refugees be returned.
But the U.N. Border Relief Operation has insisted the Cambodians be
allowed to decide where they want to live.
   The refugees had fled the Khmer Rouge camp of Kaiche after it was
attacked in mid-April.
   It was unclear why there were conflicting accounts about the fate
of the refugees.
   The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
as a ``compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should be
moved to Site 8, the only Khmer Rouge camp where the guerrillas have
allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other
services.
   Site 8 is north of Kaiche, which is along the Cambodian border
and in Thailand's eastern Trat province.
   The Thai official did not say when the transfer would take place.
   A Western relief official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, called it a ``face-saving'' decision in which the
military would avoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaiche
yet still support the Khmer Rouge, the largest of three guerrilla
groups fighting Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government.
   The official said some refugees ``have reasons to flee Khmer
Rouge control.''
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it
ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnamese forces invaded and ousted
it from power in late 1978.
   The group fled to the border, established camps just inside
Thailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the People's National
Liberation Front and of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Violations reported in Khmer Rouge refugee camps have included
forcing children to porter arms through mine fields and denying
people emergency medical treatment.
   The relief official called the flight of the refugees to Sok Sann
one of the largest escapes from a Khmer Rouge camp in recent years.
   The refugees fled after gunners inside Cambodia shelled Kaiche
and the nearby Ta Luan camp in April. Relief officials believe
hundreds of people were hurt, but the Khmer Rouge refused to allow
any to be evacuated to outside hospitals.
   In early May, the guerrillas moved several thousand refugees from
Ta Luan closer to the border, evidently to prevent the United
Nations from carrying out a plan to move them to a new, safer site.

   Entertainer Lola Falana, whose career was put on
hold two years ago due to a bout with multiple sclerosis, returns to
the stage Friday because, she says ``I'm not into being a chicken.''
   Falana, 42, was partially paralyzed when struck by the
debilitating disease in 1987.
   She was asked in mid-June to play a weekend date at the Sands
Hotel.
   ``They called and asked me `Can you be ready by Friday,''' Falana
said in a telephone interview Monday as she prepared for three days
of rehearsals. ``I told myself it's now or never _ I guess I'll have
to be ready. I'm not into being a chicken.
   ``You'd be surprised how high you can rise above these things if
you set your heart and your mind to it. You have to move ahead, and
make things happen.''
   Falana said her sizzling dance routines, a trademark since she
wowed Broadway in ``Golden Boy'' with Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1960s,
may be less evident in her new show.
   ``I haven't seen a stage in two years, and now it comes down to
four days,'' she said.

your spirit,' the California singer told reporters Monday after he
was greeted at Howard Air Base by Gen. Fred Woerner, commander in
chief of the U.S. Southern Command.
   ``You are a superperformer and a superpatriot,'' the general told
Greenwood.
   Greenwood's USO tour will include three days of performances at
bases and ``miniconcerts'' for soldiers in the field.
   The singer has won seven male vocalist of the year awards, the
Country Music Association's song of the year award for ``God Bless
the U.S.A.'' and a Grammy for best male country performance.

   Singer Bonnie Koloc says her versatility
has hurt her career.
   ``I can sing almost anything,'' she said in a recent interview.
``Country, jazz, gospel and `legitimate' all influenced me. I think
my stuff is not very classifiable; and that has hurt me my whole
career.''
   Her base of popularity is folk music, but she resists the label
folk singer.
   ``It labels you as not salable,'' she said. ``If I'd have played
piano instead of guitar, nobody would have ever called me a folk

   Koloc, who lives in Nashville, has released eight albums,
including the current ``With You on My Side.'' She also has done
theater work in New York, including Thornton Wilder's ``The Human

   Denver Broncos running back Sammy Winder has
responded to a $600,000 alienation of affection lawsuit by saying
the woman in question left her husband because of mistreatment, not
because of Winder's actions.
   Winder asked for a hearing Friday to determine whether he must
answer allegations that he had an affair with Cecelia Evans Spell,
bought her clothes and flowers, gave her money, and wined and dined
her.
   Winder said allegations by the woman's husband, Stanley Spell,
about an affair are vague and can't be countered without more
details.
   The athlete also claims Spell threatened to file criminal charges
unless Winder gave him $60,000.
   Spell encouraged his wife to lead a separate life, told her not
to use her married name and to keep their marriage a secret,
according to court documents filed by Winder.
   Spell seeks $60,000 for physical and mental distress, and
$540,000 in punitive damages from Winder, who owns a Jackson
construction company.

   Environmentalists today rejected a
compromise plan but held the door open for further negotiations with
the timber industry over protecting the spotted owl in Oregon and
Washington.
   Andy Kerr, conservation director for the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said there was not enough time to consider the plan.
   Spokesmen for logging companies said the industry was willing to
accept the compromise proposed Saturday by Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and
the state's congressional delegation at a so-called ``spotted owl
summit'' in Salem.
   The proposal called for a short-term increase in the number of
trees that could be cut on federal land in the two states while
protecting some of the older forests where the rare Northern spotted
owl nests.
   A statement issued by environmental groups said they could not
accept the timber harvest figures in the compromise without more
information.
   The congressional delegation had given both sides until this
morning to accept the plan. The deadline was set to allow Northwest
congressmen to attach a rider to an appropriations bill that comes
up in a House committee Wednesday.
   Robert L. Spence, chairman of the Northwest Forest Resources
Council, said the timber industry reluctantly accepted the plan. The
alternative was ``economic chaos,'' Spence said in a statement.
   ``The simple truth is that less timber means fewer jobs,'' Spence
said.

   A city councilman faced a recall
election today for getting a tough new anti-smoking ordinance passed.
   The ordinance sponsored by Councilman Richard Chapman banned most
indoor smoking in public places as of April 19.
   It led a smokers'-rights group to gather enough signatures to
force today's recall election, the first involving an Albuquerque
city councilor.
   Critics have also charged that Chapman votes his personal views
and ignores the wishes of the people he represents.
   ``He's got an insatiable ego and is arrogant, and his usefulness
has long since expired,'' said Frank Bowden, an organizer of recall
campaign.
   Chapman, 41, said he sponsored the bill because polls showed most
people in Albuquerque favored smoking restrictions. He said he has a
politics-for-the-people attitude but can't please everyone all the
time.
   Chapman will lose his seat if a majority of the voters in his
district choose to remove him. In addition, at least 1,943 would
have to vote against him, half the number of votes cast in the 1987
election in which he won his seat.
   The American Smokers Alliance, a national smokers' rights group,
said Chapman's defeat could deter local governments from getting on
the anti-smoking bandwagon.

<HEAD>Showdown Brewing in Congress Over Junk Bonds and S&amp;Ls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The junk bond market, already troubled by the
prospect of an economic slowdown, could suffer a heavy blow if
Congress adopts legislation forcing savings and loans to sell the
high-risk, high-yield securities, economists say.
   Nevertheless, members of Congress upset about the wave of
corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts are determined to push
thrifts out of the lucrative, but speculative, investment.
   ``The question ... is simple,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
``Should the U.S. taxpayer subsidize leveraged buyouts, takeover
artists and large corporate mergers?''
   Leach is one of the chief backers of a provision, sponsored by
Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in House-passed S&amp;L legislation. It would
forbid thrifts from buying junk bonds and force those that already
own them to sell within two years.
   The Senate version is more lenient. It maintains the current rule
restricting the junk bond holdings of federally chartered S&amp;Ls to 11
percent of assets. It extends the limit to state-chartered
institutions, but allows them to exceed it if they can come up with
extra capital.
   A House-Senate conference begins work in two weeks to resolve the
many differences, including the provisions affecting junk bonds, in
comprehensive legislation to bail out out and reform the S&amp;L
industry.
   High-yield, high-risk bonds, which are often used to finance
hostile corporate raids and management buyouts, are nicknamed junk
bonds because they have no or a low credit rating. Commercial banks
already are forbidden to invest in the bonds, but thrifts have been
allowed to buy them since the early 1980s.
   Relatively few thrifts own junk bonds _ only 161 S&amp;Ls in 36
states, a little more than 5 percent of all S&amp;Ls, according to a
report this spring by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
auditing agency.
   Most of those have relatively small investments. Ten thrifts
account for three-quarters of the industry's investment, and only
seven have junk bond portfolios exceeding the Senate's proposed
limit.
   But those numbers, according to economists, understate the extent
of thrift involvement in junk bonds and the potential ripple effects
of Dorgan's amendment.
   Between 1985 and 1988, S&amp;L junk bond holdings increased by 136
percent to $13.2 billion _ representing about 8 percent of the
entire junk bond market, according to the GAO.
   Economists warn that if the Dorgan amendment becomes law, junk
bond prices likely will fall and investors, including the S&amp;Ls
themselves, will get stuck for the losses.
   ``I think it's going to be very painful for a lot of these
thrifts,'' said economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette. ``Investors who hold junk bonds are going to have to
monitor this legislation very, very carefully.''
   Those who defend allowing thrifts to own junk bonds say such
investments have been unfairly criticized. For all practical
purposes, a thrift buying a junk bond is taking no more risk than a
thrift making a commercial loan, they say.
   Secondly, they say, junk bonds offer high returns and they allow
S&amp;Ls in economically troubled regions to diversify by purchasing
bonds from companies in healthy regions and industries.
   Economist Paul Getman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
consulting firm, said junk bonds have been among the most profitable
activities for thrifts. WEFA studied thrifts and junk bonds for the
Alliance for Capital Access, a group representing junk bond issuers
and investors.
   Junk bond critics say the bonds have never been tested by a
recession, when losses from defaults are likely to rise, offsetting
profits from high-interest earnings.
   They also say extensive junk bond investment by thrifts diverts
money from home mortgages and could allow collusion between S&amp;Ls and
securities firms selling the bonds.
   The largest S&amp;L investor in junk bonds is Columbia Savings and
Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., which owns about $4
billion, representing 35 percent of its portfolio.
   According to published reports, the Securities and Exchange
Commission has been investigating allegedly unlawful trading
arrangements between Columbia and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the
nation's largest underwriter of high yield securities.
   ``Junk bond holdings are one of the areas of most abuse,'' said
economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York. ``I as taxpayer don't want to be the
ultimate guarantor of a sweetheart deal between an S&amp;L and an
investment firm.''

<TEXT>
   A woman charged with giving her baby cocaine
while she was pregnant will be tried next month, despite arguments
by defense lawyers that drug laws do not apply to the unborn.
   Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. refused to dismiss charges against
Jennifer Clarise Johnson, 23, who gave birth in January to a girl
with traces of cocaine in her system. In 1987, she gave birth to a
son who also was exposed to cocaine.
   The unmarried mother is believed to be the second in Florida to
be arrested under the drug-delivery law, normally used to prosecute
drug dealers. It carries a maximum 30-year sentence.
   The other woman, Toni Hudson, 29, was arrested after giving birth
in November to a boy with traces of cocaine in his system.
   Ms. Hudson appeared in court Monday and pleaded no contest to
possession of cocaine. Prosecutors dropped te delivery charge and
charges of child abuse, saying her case posed technical problems.
She faces 22 months to five years in prison.
   Ms. Johnson refused to comment after her hearing Monday before
Judge Eaton, who schleduled her trial for July 26.
   She said earlier she was sorry but did not believe criminal
prosecution would help her. She lives at a drug treatment center and
her aunt and mother care for her four children.
   Assistant State Attorney Jeff Deen contends that such
prosecutions are a way to hold mothers responsible for drug use.
   ``She's had this (drug) problem for many years, and she continued
to have cocaine babies,'' Deen said Tuesday. ``That's one of the
reasons we decided to prosecute this case.''
   But her lawyer and attorneys for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Florida contend the drug-delivery law applies only to
people and a fetus is not a person under the law.
   Babies of cocaine-using mothers are usually born prematurely,
have lower birth weights, face a greater risk of being stillborn and
have a higher rate of neurological problems, according to medical
research.

<HEAD>Question on His Grandchildren Strikes a Presidential Nerve</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush fielded questions on China,
abortion and flag-burning with ease Tuesday but was hard-pressed to
explain why his grandson, and not his granddaughters, gets to go on
the presidential fishing trips.
   ``When they get older than about 3 I will do that,'' Bush replied
with a tone of consternation about why 13-year-old first grandson
George P. Bush was getting all the perks.
   The president said George P. ``plays ball and ... does stuff''
that his younger sister, brother and cousins can't yet handle.
   Actually, four of Bush's seven granddaughters are older than 3,
including George P.'s 11-year-old sister Noelle and 7-year-old twin
cousins, Jenna and Barbara.
   Unlike George P., they haven't spent the past two weeks camped
out at the White House, flying with their grandfather to fish in the
Grand Tetons or donning a tuxedo to attend a Kennedy Center
extravaganza.
   Neither have Bush's three other grandsons, who are ages 5, 4 and
3.
   The question from Jessica Lee of USA Today about the handsome
teen-ager Bush calls his ``pride and joy'' struck a nerve in what
was otherwise an unflappable performance by the early-rising
president.
   Bush squeezed in the 9 a.m. EDT news conference on short notice
before a ceremonial welcome for the visiting prime minister of
Australia.
   Bush was asked when it would be the girls' turn to go fishing or
``on some of these kind of excursions where you're doing the
business of the nation, to prepare them to be president?''
   The girls are ``a little young to go fishing in Jackson Hole ...
and put up with Marlin Fitzwater and all these people,'' Bush
replied, referring to his staff.
   ``I want them prepared for the real world. I'm serious,'' said
Bush, adding that Noelle had ``a wonderful time'' on her last visit
to the White House in April.
   ``My affection for our oldest grandson is just that he's there
and he's ready and he plays ball and he does stuff,'' said Bush.
``We're going to the Orioles game tomorrow, I think it is, but it is
not discriminatory. It is not discriminatory.''
   Prematurely revealing plans to attend the Wednesday night
baseball game in Baltimore's Memorial Stadium was one of the few
slips Bush made.
   It was Bush's 16th formal news conference and his first in nearly
three weeks. The relaxed president held forth for almost 45 minutes,
taking five ``last'' questions before finally heading out the door.
   No, Bush said, he won't ask Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng to
return the cowboy boots Bush gave him in February embossed with the
American flag.
   ``And I hope he doesn't ask for his bicycles back either,'' said
the president.
   Bush made a speech Monday decrying spouse abuse and other
violence against women. Asked if he intended to take that message to
``macho'' groups such as the National Rifle Association, Bush shot
back, ``Hey listen, I'm a member of the NRA. You're hurting my
feelings, as they say in China.''
   He said the Soviets shouldn't be ``uptight'' about his upcoming
visit to Poland and Hungary, just as he didn't mind the raves Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev got on his tour of West Germany.
   ``I feel comfortable about the wavelength we're on with the
Soviet Union now,'' said Bush.
   He cited small things that make him feel that way: the Soviets
dispatching a ship to help clean up the oil mess in Alaska, and Bush
sending the Army's crack burn team to help victims of a pipeline
explosion in the Soviet Union.
   Bush said he won't be rushed into an early summit with Gorbachev
just for appearances' sake.
   ``I've been around this track long enough to know that you can
always whip out something to sign, a fishing agreement or something
of this nature,'' he said.
   But he added that if there was no major treaty in the offing,
``Maybe we'll do it like this: say, `Hey, let's get together.'''
   He was a little more demonstrative than he wanted to be when
asked about the Senate-passed child care bill that Bush disagrees
with.
   ``I've got to be careful of these gestures, the way these _ Rich
Little and these guys _ '' he said, referring to comics who have had
a field day with both the Bush syntax and body language.
   Bush dodged _ or tried to _ only one question, when asked about
Cincinnati Reds' manager Pete Rose and his betting case.
   ``Baseball, the national pastime, has sound rules regarding
betting on baseball games and I simply am ... not going to get into
that one,'' said the president.

   Trash has proved to be a
13-year-old girl's ticket to Washington, D.C.
   Amy Carlton, a Hancock County Middle School student, won first
place in the state and regional competitions of the Invent America
contest. The latest victory means a $500 bond and a trip to the
nation's capital with her ``trash stash'' invention for another
round of competition.
   The device, inserted in the rear deck of a car below the back
windshield, is a slot with a swinging door that allows trash to be
dropped into a bag in the trunk. The bag is easily changed when full.
   ``Our car is always a mess,'' Amy said. It was the car's littered
floorboard which provided her with the inspiration to build the
device.
   Invent America is sponsored by the non-profit U.S. Patent Model
Foundation based in Washington, to encourage schoolchildren to be
inventive.
   After state competitions, five regional winners are chosen for
each grade kindergarten through eighth. So Amy will compete against
four other 7th graders in the national finals July 22-27.
   This week, Amy must send her invention to Patent Model
Foundation. Her working model of the invention includes the actual
rear deck of a car surrounded by plastic foam to resemble a cutaway
section of a car.
   She said she plans to seek a patent on her invention in hopes of
getting rich.

   Sick of slow service? Incensed by
indifference? Does bad food leave you bummed, pal? Well, for a
paltry $2.25, you don't have to take it anymore. Just use a
Consum-Alert sticker.
   The stickers can be applied on the window _ or the employee if
you're that angry _ of the offending business. They aren't permanent
_ they use static cling and can easily be removed and leave no
sticky residue.
   The black and gold flourescent stickers are the idea of radio
announcer Bill Flynn and ad agency owner Greg Fischer.
   ``I can only say there have been ample opportunities in my life
in the last six months where I could have used one of these things
and felt justified in doing so,'' Flynn said Tuesday. ``We live in a
time where it's so easy to be treated like a number.''
   ``The ultimate goal is to just be able to vent ourselves,''
Fischer said.
   Purchasers get six decals to an order. Black letters say:
``Consum-Alert Warning! This Business Has Been Targeted By Your
Fellow Consumer For'' one of four offenses.
   White letters on a black background indicate the offense: ``Slow
Service,'' ``Poor Service,'' ``Bad Attitude'' or ``Poor Hygiene.''
There are two Poor Service stickers and two for Bad Attitude.
   Instructions with the stickers claim ``the feeling of
self-respect and vindication you get is exhilarating.''
   The stickers should be placed, according to the instructions, in
a ``high-visibility, eye-level location for your Consum-Alert. Put
that sucker where everyone can see it!''
   The instructions don't encourage confrontation. The pleasure of
relieving frustration should be sufficient. ``You've joined the
ranks of Robin Hood and The Lone Ranger. Be proud.''
   Some of the proceeds from the sale of the stickers will go to the
Better Business Bureau, although Flynn admits ``We hope to make
money on this.''

   The West German government has agreed to a U.S.
request to expel an Iranian diplomat involved in a German company's
sale of poison-gas chemicals to Iran, the Bush administration said
Tuesday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told visiting West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher about the sales during a
luncheon last week, said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler.
   Genscher said he knew nothing about the incident, Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   The company, to circumvent stricter West German export controls,
bought the chemicals from a business in India, another
administration official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to
name the West German company.
   The diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified
as Said Karim Ali Sobhani, an official of Iran's trade mission.
   Ms. Tutwiler said it was understandable that West German
officials don't know about every sale by every West German company.
She also said the United States was satisfied with the West German
response, but doesn't view the case as closed.
   News of the incident comes as Congress considers several
proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell
chemical and biological weapons.
   The proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year
that West German companies sold Libya equipment for production of
chemical weapons. West Germany tightened its export control laws as
a result of the ensuing furor.
   Iran and Iraq used chemical weapons during their nine-year war
that ended last year.
   Use of the chemical weapons prompted the United States to join
with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can
be used by Third World countries as weapons.

   Preliminary evidence indicates no
wrongdoing in the second death of a sailor within 16 months in
training pools at Pensacola Naval Air Station, a Navy spokesman said
Tuesday.
   ``It appears the safety procedures were followed to the letter''
before Friday's death of Michael Fedie, 22, a naval aviation officer
candidate from Altoona, Wis., said Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, public
affairs officer for the Naval Education and Training Command.
   That wasn't the case with the March 2, 1988, death of Airman
Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., who drowned during an
intense rescue-swimmer drill. Navy officials were secretive about
investigations that led to disciplinary action against five enlisted
instructors and an officer in Mirecki's death.
   ``In this case it is sort of looking like there's nothing like
that, so we are being more forthcoming,'' Hessler said, but he
emphasized that everything was still preliminary.
   Fedie collapsed in shallow water while walking from a pool after
an abandon-ship drill, a Navy spokesman said. In the exercise,
trainees jump from a 12-foot tower wearing flight suits and boots
and swim 15 yards underwater to simulate avoiding burning fuel on
the surface.
   As early as Saturday, the Navy disclosed preliminary autopsy data
that indicated Fedie died of acute cerebral edema, a swelling of the
brain and excess fluid that can be caused by lack of oxygen.
   Hessler said Fedie was conscious after being pulled from the
water. Fedie was questioned to determine if he was coherent, and was
able to tell rescuers who he was and give his class number, Hessler
said.
   In response to a question, Fedie said he did not hit his head on
anything, and the preliminary autopsy also indicated no evidence he
had hit his head, Hessler said.
   But Fedie then went into convulsions and lost consciousness,
Hessler said. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen were
administered at poolside before an ambulance took Fedie to the
Pensacola Naval Hospital where he died.
   Fedie was a strong swimmer and had passed a physical examination
June 9, Hessler said.
   One possibility is that Fedie may have had a pre-existing medical
condition that failed to show up during the exam, Hessler said.
Final autopsy results are expected in a couple of weeks, but Hessler
was uncertain if they would be made public.

   Efforts by Premier Andreas Papandreou to
form a coalition government from his hospital bed ended Tuesday with
a rebuff from the communist alliance.
   A medical bulletin issued by his doctors said the health of the
70-year-old Socialist was ``continually improving.'' He was
hospitalized Thursday for pneumonia, eight months after undergoing
heart surgery, and developed kidney and heart complications.
   Harilaos Florakis, leader of the Coalition of the Left and

Movement were ``just as interesting'' as those made last week by
Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the conservative New Democracy
party.
   Florakis said he favored a ``widely accepted'' government ``not

alliance of the Greek Communist Party and the Greek Left, a
Eurocommunist group.
   Negotiations began after inconclusive elections June 18.
   Officials of Papandreou's party did not disclose their proposals,
but said one condition was that he lead the government. New
Democracy had offered the alliance the Interior and Justice
ministries, but the communists rejected Mitsotakias as head of the
government.
   Doctors said Papandreou's heart condition was under control and
he was being treated successfully with a kidney dialysis machine.
The premier sent a representative to meet with the communists.
   New elections may be held soon if a government cannot be formed.
The communist alliance said it would support an effort to create a
national unity coalition.
   New Democracy won 145 seats in the 300-seat unicameral
parliament, six short of a majority. Papandreou's Socialists, hurt
by scandals in recent months, got 125 seats and the communist
alliance 28.
   Mitsotakis could not obtain communist support in the time allowed
and the Socialists were given their turn Friday, but negotiations
were delayed until Monday because of Papandreou's condition.
   Florakis said he would meet with leaders of both major parties
about the possibility of a broad coalition.

   The 11-year-old Californian flying around the world
in a small plane is getting VIP treatment in Moscow, but his
hoped-for meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains in
doubt.
   Tony Aliengena said Tuesday if he does meet the Soviet leader, he
knows exactly what he will say:
   ``Hello, Comrade Gorbachev, I'm happy I flew to Russia,'' he
pronounced in Russian.
   Meanwhile, the pilot and his family are staying in an exclusive
hotel normally reserved for members of the Communist Party's Central
Committee. Their ``Friendship Flight '89'' was the subject of an
article in Pravda, and they held a news conference Tuesday in the
Foreign Ministry press center where senior government spokesmen
usually give briefings.
   The youngster is scheduled to meet unidentified officials at the
Kremlin on Wednesday. He hopes to present Gorbachev with a
friendship scroll signed by 250,000 American children.
   ``We're still expecting wonders, we're expecting various
surprises,'' said Gennady Alferenko, director of the Foundation for
Social Inventions, a Soviet foundation that helped sponsor the
flight.
   After the news conference, Aliengena visited Red Square, where
two years ago West German teen-ager Matthias Rust got a very
different reception. Rust gained worldwide attention and more than a
year in Soviet prison for piloting his small plane past Soviet air
defenses and landing in Red Square.
   The Californian took off in his blue-and-white Cessna Centurion
from California on June 5. His flight plan will take 47 days and
19,000 miles in short hops averaging three hours each.
   On July 1, Tony is to fly on to the Volga River city of Kuibyshev
and stop in at least eight Soviet cities before eventually cross the
Bering Straits to Alaska.
   He is collecting signatures of Soviet youngsters to present a
friendship scroll to President Bush on his return.
   The boy said Tuesday he undertook the trip because ``When I got
done crossing the United States, I wanted to fly around the world,
and my dad said I had to come up with a good reason, so I came up
with the friendship idea.''
   He said he looks forward to riding his bicycle and seeing his dog
when he gets home to San Juan Capistrano.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's ``visceral'' reaction to a
Supreme Court decision on flag burning echoes the emotional response
by the four dissenting justices and millions of other Americans.
   And as Bush demonstrated in 1988 _ to the undying regret of
Michael Dukakis _ defending the flag against would-be desecrators
also is good politics.
   The same emotion that moved Justice John Paul Stevens to read a
dissenting opinion in court last week, and that Bush cited in his
news conference Tuesday, is on display in Congress where Republicans
and Democrats already are rushing to overturn the court's ruling.
   Bush, in calling for a constitutional amendment to undo the
court's June 21 ruling _ that burning the American flag is a
protected form of political protest _ described the flag as a
``unique national symbol.''
   Stevens, like the president a decorated World War II veteran,
used that exact language in the dissenting opinion he read from the
bench in a voice filled with emotion.
   He said if the ``ideas of liberty and equality'' that motivated
war heroes are worth fighting for ``it cannot be true that the flag
that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of
protection from unnecessary desecration.''
   Stevens isn't concerned with the next election, but that makes
him unusual in a hotly debated issue which links the court, the
Congress and now the president.
   The president's successful 1988 presidential campaign emphasized
patriotic values, and included a much-publicized visit to a factory
where American flags are made.
   He also attacked Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis, the
governor of Massachusetts, for vetoing a bill that would have
required public school teachers in that state to lead daily pledges
of allegiance to the flag.
   The lesson has not been lost on Democrats.
   One Democratic member of Congress, Douglas Applegate of Ohio,
said of the Supreme Court ruling, ``I'm mad as hell. What in God's
name is going on. America should be outraged.''
   Even new House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who later said he
does not favor a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning,
called the decision ``deeply offensive.''
   But Foley reacted angrily Tuesday when reporters suggested that
Republicans could make flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats
fail to push for a constitutional amendment.
   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,''
Foley said.
   He added that trying to capitalize on the flag-burning flap would
be ``playing the most cynical politics ... for the most base and
crass political purposes.'' But he also said a House subcommittee
would soon conduct hearings on the various congressional proposals.
   In the Senate, a resolution opposing the decision passed 97-3.
The dissenting votes belonged to Democrats Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and Republican Gordon
Humphrey of New Hampshire.
   Humphrey, one of the Senate's bedrock conservatives, has
announced he will not seek re-election.
   The court's decision dealt with symbolic speech. Some may
consider the president's response a form of symbolism as well.
   To date, emotional reactions have overwhelmed substantive
discussion.
   Just what, and who, did the ruling protect?
   The court overturned the conviction of a man charged with burning
a flag _ not with stealing that flag, or trespassing, or disturbing
the peace, or threatening anyone's safety.
   Nothing in the Constitution would protect him from those other
charges.
   People have a right to burn their flags as a means of
self-expression even if it offends most people, the court said. But
that constitutionally protected right does not apply when it's
someone else's flag, on someone else's property, or someone else is
endangered.
   Some day somewhere in America, someone so disturbed by high taxes
might take a miniature American flag into the backyard and set it
afire.
   Should that be a criminal act?
   Five Supreme Court members who apparently would view that act as
the equivalent of an angry letter said no.
   Four high court members who apparently would view that act more
as conduct than expression said yes.
   The constitutional amendment backed by Bush would permit criminal
prosecution of that backyard protester.

   A Palestinian prisoner in a desert detention
center killed two inmates, the army said Tuesday, and police
suggested the victims may have been accused of collaborating with
Israeli authoritiies.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli troops wounded at least 29
Palestinians when they opened fire on stone-throwers, hospital
officials said. Four victims were 11 years old, they said.
   Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he will meet
Palestinian leaders from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip next
month to discuss his election plan.
   The killings in Ketziot, a Negev desert jail for Palestinian
security prisoners, were discovered when the men failed to report
for morning roll call, said an army official, who cannot be
identified under military rules.
   Police said the men may have been killed as suspected
collaborators. But the army spokesman said the killer may have been
avenging the 1985 killing of a friend.
   Israel radio said a prisoner confessed to the slayings, which
raise to four the number of inmates killed by fellow prisoners in
the past two weeks.
   Itim news agency said the victims were strangled, and police are
investigating whether the killer had accomplices.
   Those killed were identified as Mahmoud Abdul Abedgalla, 24, and
Ali Hijazi Taaf, 30. Both are from the Gaza Strip.
   Also Tuesday, Tarek Salih Awad, 17, died of bullet wounds from a
Saturday clash with Israeli troops, said officials at Mukassed
Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem. The army confirmed the death.
   His death increased the toll to 537 Palestinians killed since
Arabs started revolting against Israeli occupation in December 1987.
Sixy-eight have been killed as collaborators by fellow Arabs.
Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   In Gaza Strip, Israeli troops opened fire on stone-throwing
demonstrators in Rafah town, wounding 21 Palestinians, doctors said.
Victims include a 17-year-old with a bad head wound, they said.
   Three other Palestinians were wounded in Khan Yunis refugee camp,
three in Shati refugee camp and one each in Nuseirat and Bureij
camps, hospital officials said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed three injuries in Rafah, all from
plastic bullets, and said troops were forced to open fire when a
large crowd began hurling stones.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the Israeli leader will meet
Palestinian leaders in July, but declined to reveal their names.
   Pazner denied Israeli media reports that some Palestinians at the
talks will be supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections to select Palestinian
representatives from the occupied lands to open peace talks with
Israel. The proposal has been rejected by the PLO and prominent
Palestinians in the territories who say it does not recognize their
aspiration for an independent state. Hard-liners in Shamir's Likud
bloc want the proposal amended because they say it could lead to
creation of a Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Eds: Subs 3rd graf to CORRECT Saturn's to Jupiter's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering space probe suggested
Saturn's largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid
natural gas, but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it
may have some dry land or an icy surface.
   ``We interpret our results to mean that the surface of Titan is
highly variable,'' planetary scientist Duane O. Muhleman said in an
announcement issued Monday by the California Institute of Technology.
   Titan, nearly twice as massive as Earth's moon, is one of only
three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres. The
others are Jupiter's moon Io and Neptune's moon Triton.
   Data from Voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane,
components of natural gas, condense in Titan's mostly nitrogen
atmosphere and rain on the surface, leading some scientists to
believe Titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and
methane.
   Muhleman and his colleagues bounced 360,000-watt radar signals
off Titan during three 5{-hour periods on June 3, 4 and 5.
   An ethane-methane ocean would have low reflectivity, creating
weak radar echoes. Instead, they found strong radar echoes during
one observation period and weak echoes during the other two while
Titan rotated on its axis. That suggests Titan has oceans in some
places and a solid surface in others.

<TEXT>
   A Union Pacific freight train derailed Tuesday,
forcing the shutdown of a gasoline pipeline that exploded and
leveled a neighborhood last month in San Bernardino, Calif., a fire
official said.
   No injuries were reported in Tuesday's accident north of downtown
Las Vegas, said fire department spokesman Evert Wilson.
   Workers for the Calnev Pipeline Co. shut down the pipeline
shortly after the derailment, Wilson said. The line, which parallels
the tracks at the point of the derailment, did not appear to be
damaged.
   Twenty-one cars derailed, narrowly missing some trailer homes.
Most of the cars were empty, although some were carrying gravel,
officials said.
   The pipeline carries much of the area's gasoline and diesel fuel
supply from Southern California refineries to storage tanks on the
northern edge of Las Vegas, where it is distributed to local dealers.
   Two lines in the pipeline were shut down, said Calnev's spokesman
Richard Kline. Both lines were drained as an added precaution.
   Calnev spokesman Richard Kline said the lines could be reopened
within a matter of hours once the safety of the lines was assured.
   It was not immediately known when the lines would be turned on
again, officials said.
   On May 12, a Southern Pacific freight train speeding from Cajon
Pass jumped the tracks in San Bernardino, plowing into a row of
houses. Calnev officials checked a pipeine paralleling the tracks in
San Bernardino and said the line was safe.
   But the Calnev line ruptured May 25, torching 22 homes. A total
of six people were killed in the two incidents and 42 were injured.

   President Bush said Tuesday that China remains
a country of strategic importance to the United States but a
`normalized relationship'' is impossible so long as Chinese
authorities continue their harsh crackdown on dissent.
   At a news conference, Bush also expressed regret over China's
decision not to accept American Peace Corps volunteers for the time
being.
   ``I'm sorry that the Chinese have made that decision,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, Chinese authorities gave 11 Americans associated with
a religious order until Friday to leave the country. Last Saturday,
officials seized religious materials from the group.
   Bush, in his appearance before reporters, maintained the same
posture on overall U.S. policy toward China that he embraced after
the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators three weeks ago.
   ``It's impossible at this moment to have what I would say are
normalized relations, for various, very obvious reasons. But I am
going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there
that will help the Chinese people,'' Bush said.
   On the other hand, Bush said he cannot ignore the strategic side
of the relationship with China.
   He said China is important not only because it is a neighbor of
the Soviet Union but also because it is able to exert influence in
such senstive areas as Cambodia and the Korean peninsula.
   Citing what he said were the gains in relations with China, Bush
said tens of thousands of Chinese have studied here _ ``30,000
students right this minute'' _ and go back home ``with a sense of
what freedom and democracy are all about.''
   The ties with China also helped that country end the isolation of
the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and contributed to the evolution of
a much more open economic system, Bush said.
   With some fanfare, before the upheaval in China got under way
this spring, the two countries signed an agreement for a Peace Corps
contingent to go to China this fall to teach English.
   China's decision to postpone the arrival of the volunteers is the
latest indication of the decline in relations between the two
countries.
   Bush said, ``If the Chinese say they're not welcome, they can't
come in. And it's too bad, because one of the things that moved
forward the reforms was contact with Americans. And I don't want to
see those contacts cut off.''
   As for the 11 American ordered to leave, State Department
officials had been concerned that Chinese authorities might detain
them for carrying out religious activities in China.
   They had been charged by police with distributing religious
literature and were ordered to remain in Kunming.
   The group, associated with the Latter Rain Ministry, of
Litchfield, Ill., had gone to China on June 13, ignoring a State
Department warning that travel for Americans to China might be
dangerous.
   They had planned to leave China in early July but Chinese
authorities curtailed their visas, ordering them out of the country
by Friday.
   A 12th American was not ordered out of China but his
multiple-entry visa was taken away, Ms. Tutwiler said.

   An elementary school principal who drafted his
own 11-point peace plan said Tuesday he canceled a trip to Egypt to
promote the proposal because Israel barred him from meeting PLO
officials.
   Assad Saftawi attracted attention with his plan calling for local
Palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy for the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The plan brought positive reactions from Israeli officials who
said it indicated Palestinians from the occupied territories are
willing to start negotiations without the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel designates a terrorist group.
   The officials considered it a favorable response to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for elections in the occupied
lands to choose Palestinians to negotiate with Israel about
self-rule. Talks on the final status would be left until later.
   But Saftawi, headmaster of a school in the Gaza Strip's Bureij
refugee camp, told Israeli officials he needed PLO approval.
   ``There is no way that my peace plan will be valid unless the PLO
looks at it and agrees on it,'' he said.
   ``But the Israelis think that if they let me go and talk to the
PLO they will recognize the PLO in a roundabout way.''
   Saftawi, 54, said he is canceling his trip to Egypt since the
main purpose was to meet PLO officials.
   He met Monday with Shmuel Goren, Israel's coordinator for the
occupied territories, and conferred last month with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   The Rabin meeting was considered significant because of Saftawi's
history as a pro-PLO activist convicted in 1973 for belonging to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
   Fatah official Salah Khalaf was quoted Tuesday as criticizing
Saftawi's plan. The Kuwait daily Al-Watan quoted Khalaf as saying:
``I think we differ with this blueprint because we consider any
separation between the elections and comprehensive solution to be
designed to serve Israel's interests.''
   An Israeli military official said Goren warned Saftawi he faced
prosecution if he violated Israeli laws barring contacts with the
PLO.
   ``We told him that if he wants to go abroad, he can do it. ... If
he disobeys the law, however, he will have to take the
consequences,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.
   ``Every Palestinian who asks for permission to meet with PLO
officials gets the same answer,'' he added.
   Violators from the occupied territories can be sentenced to up to
10 years in jail, said an army spokesman. Israeli violators can get
up to three years in prison.
   The attorney general's office said Tuesday it is investigating
three Israeli legislators for meeting with Arafat. Those under
investigation are Communist Party Members Meir Wilner and Tawfik
Ziad and Abdel Wahab Darousha, an Israeli-Arab from the Democratic
Arab Party.

<TEXT>
   Berlin's largest synagogue, nearly destroyed by
World War II bombs, will be rebuilt as the center of Jewish worship
and culture in the city's communist eastern sector, organizers said
Tuesday.
   The announcement was made at a news conference in East Berlin
attended by Heinz Galinski, the leader of West Germany's Jewish
communities, along with members of East Berlin's Jewish community.
They make up a group called the Association for Rebuilding, which is
coordinating restoration of the synagogue.
   East German leader Erich Honecker laid the cornerstone for
rebuilding the synagogue last year, but workers soon discovered that
nearly the entire building will have to be torn down and reassembled.
   West Germany has pledged about $500,000 toward restoration of the
building, but more is needed, said Hermann Simon, secretary of the
rebuilding association. He said there were no final estimates of the
cost.
   East German officials are counting on most of the cost to be
covered by donations.
   About 173,000 Jews lived in Berlin before the Nazi Holocaust.
Today, about 6,000 Jews live in West Berlin, and about 300 Jews live
in East Berlin.
   The Berlin synagogue was burned during the Nazis' ``Crystal
Night'' attacks of Nov. 9-10, 1938, but a policeman saved the
building by calling the fire department. Allied bombers virtually
destroyed the complex during the war.

   Lawyers working on a new legal hotline for foreign
students received dozens of queries Tuesday from Chinese worried
about possible danger when they return home after joining in
anti-government protests.
   Some of the callers asked how to get foreign passports or how to
defect, said Kohei Sugino, a spokesman for the free telephone
service sponsored by the Tokyo Bar Association Committee for the
Protection of Human Rights.
   The hotline had 74 calls Tuesday _ its first day _ and will
operate for two more days, Sugino said.
   Most of the callers were Chinese, worried that their
participation in anti-government demonstrations might endanger them
when they go home.
   ``They are extremely uneasy because Japan grants visa extensions
on a case-by-case basis,'' Sugino said.
   The Japanese Ministry of Justice has announced it will consider
granting individual six-month visa extensions for students who have
finished their studies and whose visas have expired. As of June 21,
43 such students had applied, but no one had yet been granted the
special extension, said a Justice Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Since Japan does not give blanket visa extensions, China will be
able to find out which students are seeking to avoid going home,
Sugino said.
   He also said some students were concerned about returning home
even temporarily. There are rumors going around that students
visiting home must report on their political activities to obtain a
Chinese exit visa to return to Japan.
   Sugino said the lawyers advised callers on Japanese visa
procedures.
   Government officials say more than 7,700 Chinese students are in
Japanese universities or colleges, and another 120,000 Chinese are
in Japan for business or other purposes.

   Democratic change is so far advanced in Hungary
that it is conceivable a majority of the Hungarian parliament will
become noncommunist in the next two to five years, a State
Department official told Congress Tuesday.
   The official, Curtis W. Kamman, deputy assistant secretary of
state for European affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee the Bush administration does not believe House
legislation to reward Hungary with a five-year exemption from
economic and trade restrictions is needed.
   He explained that Hungary has removed practically all
restrictions on the ability of its citizens to travel abroad or to
emigrate at will, the objective of the restrictions.
   Kamman said that while both Hungary and Poland are building
democratic institutions, Hungary has drafted a new constitution and
has scheduled multiparty local elections for the fall and multiparty
national elections next year.
   ``It is conceivable that within the next two to five years, you
could have a majority in the Hungarian parliament that will be
noncommunist,'' Kamman said.
   He said both Hungary and Poland have permitted more freedom of
speech and the press than ever before in modern times.
   President Bush will visit Hungary and Poland during his trip to
Europe next month and Kamman said: ``By his presence, we will
encourage and signify our commitment to their struggle for freedom
and democracy.''
   Kamman said the administration is working on economic initiatives
for Hungary similar to those Bush announced for Poland during a
speech last month.
   He was asked whether or not that progress could or might be
reversed.
   ``The potential for reversal is very, very low,'' he replied. ``I
really don't foresee it in either Poland or Hungary if the present
leaders remain in power.
   But he noted that the climate for democratic change could be
altered if ``dramatic changes occurred in the Soviet Union,''
altering its apparent present tolerance toward independent political
development in Eastern Europe.
   Kamman said Eastern Europe can no longer be seen as a
Moscow-dominated, communist monolith.
   He said democratic reforms are most advanced in Hungary and
Poland and that there have been modest changes in Czechoslovakia,
East Germany, and Bulgaria. The exception is Romania, where he said
the political and economic situation appears to be rapidly
deteriorating.
   ``What we see now is that if the promise of reform is kept,
Eastern Europe will be a very different place: more true to its own
historical traditions, more independent and ultimately more
prosperous and stable,'' Kamman said.
   ``It is no longer a bloc but an increasingly interesting and
important grouping of individual countries _ each moving forward or
sideways or, as in Romania's case, backwards.''

<HEAD>Soviets May Help to Resolve Mass Migration of Ethnics from Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet ambassador met with Turkey's
foreign minister Tuesday and indicated Moscow may try to help
resolve problems that have led to the exodus of tens of thousands of
ethnic Turks from Bulgaria.
   ``We are at the beginning of a road,'' Ambassador Albert
Chernishev told reporters Tuesday after meeting Foreign Minister
Todor Zhivkov. ``This diplomatic process will continue.''
   In the past month, more than 75,000 ethnic Turks have crossed
into Turkey to escape an assimilation campaign, the Anatolia news
agency said Tuesday.
   The mass emigration followed protests by ethnic Turks in May in
which Bulgarian police used clubs and dogs to quell. Bulgaria said
seven people died in the protests, but Western sources say up to 30
died.
   Bulgaria then relaxed its emigration policies. Last week, it said
250,000 ethnic Turks had applied for passports and 150,000 of them
had received travel documents.
   Chernishev returned to Turkey on Monday after meeting last week
with Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov and gave Turkish officials a
message from Zhikov, which he did not disclose.
   ``Bulgaria is a Soviet ally. But we also want to improve our
relations with the friendly country Turkey,'' Anatolia quoted
Chernishev as saying upon his return.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement after the meeting and
said ``there was no reason to be optimistic yet, but the efforts of
the Soviet Union were appreciated.''
   The ministry said the Soviet Union was trying to figure out how
it could be helpful in solving the problems of ethnic Turks, who
make up about 1 million of Bulgaria's 9 million people.
   Chernishev flew to Moscow on June 21 after Yilmaz summoned him to
the Foreign Ministry and reportedly urged the the Soviet Union play
a more active role in the plight of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria.
   Premier Turgut Ozal has called on Bulgaria to open negotiations
on the status of the mainly Moslem ethnic Turks, who were forced to
take Bulgarian names and cannot speak their own language or practice
their religion in Bulgaria under a 1984 law.
   Bulgaria's ethnic Turks and Christian Slavs have been deeply
suspicious of each other since its 500-year rule by the Ottoman
Empire. Bulgarian officials blame Turkish propaganda for the exodus.
   Ozal wants to hold talks with Bulgaria and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees for an orderly transfer of ethnic Turks
who want to leave Bulgaria. Turkey wants the ethnic Turks to be
allowed to dispose of their property and take their liquid wealth
with them.
   Ozal said Monday the Soviet Union has been boasting about its
social and democratic reforms under Mikhail S. Gorbachev and that
the Kremlin's attitude to the problems of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria
would put that to the test.
   ``Let us see what kind of a democrat Gorbachev is,'' Ozal said in
a speech at Gazi University here.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat for delivery this year under the
long-term grain agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Officials said the sale, by unidentified private exporters, was a
straight commercial transaction and did not involve subsidies under
the department's Export Enhancement Program.
   The Soviet Union has bought more than 4.2 million tons of wheat
under EEP arrangements for 1988-89 delivery, the most recent being
96,000 tons announced on June 23.
   Although the Soviets had virtually used up the previous EEP
allocation, a new deal for an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat
was announced May 2. Officials said Moscow still has 814,200 tons
available under the program.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. According to the latest USDA five-day average, the price
of wheat has been $3.85 per bushel, meaning the latest sale of
approximately 14.7 million bushels could have a farm value of around
$56 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The sale announced Tuesday boosted to more than 21.2 million tons
the amount of grain Moscow has bought for delivery in the sixth year
of the agreement, which began last Oct. 1. Of that, corn makes up
nearly 16.2 million tons, and wheat, more than 5 million tons.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 442,500 tons of soybeans;
1.35 million tons of soybean meal; and more than 1 million tons of
grain sorghum.

<HEAD>Iranian Diplomat in Poison Gas Deal Returns to Tehran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian diplomat accused of
coordinating the purchase of chemicals for making poison gas has
left the country and won't return, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
   The ministry also said it was investigating a Duesseldorf company
the United States claims was a broker for the transaction.
   Spokesman Hanns Schumacher said West Germany asked Iran to recall
the diplomat after receiving information from Washington about his
alleged links to the deal, but the man already had left.
   ``The person in question has not worked at the embassy for some
time and will not resume his duties there,'' Schumacher said.
   He did not identify the diplomat or indicate why he left before
the formal request. Informed sources in Bonn identified him as Seyed
Karim Ali Sobhani and said he had worked at the Iranian Embassy in
Bonn since September 1987.
   Sobhani's name also came up in the case of Peter Walaschek, a
West German arrested in the United States in July 1988 for trying to
ship thiodiglycol, which is used in mustard gas, to Iran. Walaschek
pleaded guilty and said he bought the chemical at the request of
Sobhani.
   Walaschek later fled the United States and officials believe he
is hiding out in West Germany.
   Rainer Mueller, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, said ``we
were informed by the Americans ... last week'' about the Duesseldorf
company that allegedly acted as a broker.
   ``We have notified the appropriate departments to take the
necessary steps'' for an investigation, Mueller told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
   Mueller, the ministry spokesman on Middle East affairs, refused
to name the company and U.S. officials also have not identified it.
   Tuesday's editions of The New York Times said the company acted
as a broker in arranging the sale to Iran of hundreds of tons of
thionyl chloride, which can be used to make mustard gas. It said the
gas was to be made by an Indian manufacturer, but most of the
chemical was not delivered.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III told the Hans-Dietrich Genscher about the
sales when the West German foreign minister visited the U.S. capital
last week.
   Late last year, U.S. officials accused West German companies of
helping Libya build a facility south of Tripoli that was described
by the Americans as a chemical weapons factory and by Libya as a
pharmaceuticals plant.
   After a long investigation, West German authorities arrested
Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, former head of Imhausen-Chemie
company. His case is still pending.
   Iran reached a cease-fire with Iran in August after eight years
of war. Iraq acknowledged using poison gas during the war, but
accused the Iranians of using it first.

<HEAD>U.S. Judge Orders HUD, Boston, State To Combat Housing Bias</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, the state and the city to work harder
to eliminate racial discrimination in housing in metropolitan Boston.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner stems from a
lawsuit filed 11 years ago by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People against HUD.
   Dianne Wilkerson of the NAACP in Boston called the ruling ``a
blockbuster _ a whole new world.''
   ``This really is a challenge,'' Ms. Wilkerson said Tuesday. ``In
the end it's a challenge to (HUD Secretary) Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp has
said fair housing is a challenge for his administration. If that's
true, they won't appeal.''
   Jacqueline Roundtree, a HUD spokeswoman in Boston, said agency
attorneys were reviewing the ruling and had not decided whether to
appeal.
   The Boston Fair Housing Commission has found that eight of 10
blacks who look for a home to rent or buy encounter discrimination,
Ms. Wilkerson said. Friday's ruling gives them more means to fight
back, she said.
   From 1977 to 1982, Skinner said in his ruling, HUD broke federal
law by failing to use its grant programs to produce an adequate
supply of affordable integrated housing and failing to require
effective fair housing enforcement by the city.
   ``The conditions, exacerbated by HUD's pattern of inaction,
apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable,'' the
ruling said.
   Skinner's ruling orders:
   _ HUD to require that all landlords who get federal aid
participate in programs that market suburban housing to low-income
minorities.
   _ Boston to create a Housing Opportunity Clearinghouse that lists
available public housing.
   _ The state to give the Boston Fair Housing Commission legal
authority to issue subpoenas, levy fines and initiate civil actions
against discrimination.
   In 1985, Skinner said he agreed with the NAACP suit, finding that
HUD was aware that Boston had a history of racial bias in housing
and that its acute shortage of low-income family housing affected
blacks more than whites.
   However, he dismissed the lawsuit then, saying he lacked
authority to review and correct the agency's practices. In 1987, an
appeals court said Skinner did have authority, and ordered him to
reopen the case.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn said Tuesday he welcomed the decision and has
supported many similar remedies since becoming mayor in 1984.
   Marcia Hertz, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of
Communities and Development, the state housing agency, praised the
ruling.
   ``It actually mirrors the state policies already in place. Our
programs and policies all have strong affirmative action
components.''
   Ms. Roundtree said, ``If you ask whether there's been some
improvement in Boston since 1978, from a public housing standpoint,
our survey and monitoring report in 1987 showed there are still some
problems.
   ``We're not 100 percent where everybody has equal housing but
we're moving in that direction, it's probably not as much as the
judge wanted.''
   Metropolitan Boston refers to an area of 2.8 million people in
about 110 municipalities. While 13 percent of Boston's 573,000
people are black, there are no current figures available on the
percentage in the metropolitan area.

   The West German government has agreed to a U.S.
request to expel an Iranian diplomat involved in a German company's
sale of poison-gas chemicals to Iran, the Bush administration said
Tuesday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told visiting West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher about the sales during a
luncheon last week, said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler.
   Genscher said he knew nothing about the incident, Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   German authorities undertook an investigation into the activities
of the company, a small firm in Dusseldorf, said a West German
Embassy official.
   The company, to circumvent stricter West German export controls,
bought the chemicals from a business in India, another
administration official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to
name the West German company.
   The diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified
as Said Karim Ali Sobhani, an official of Iran's trade mission.
   Ms. Tutwiler said it was understandable that West German
officials don't know about every sale by every West German company.
She also said the United States was satisfied with the West German
response, but doesn't view the case as closed.
   News of the incident comes as Congress considers several
proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell
chemical and biological weapons.
   The proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year
that West German companies sold Libya equipment for production of
chemical weapons. West Germany tightened its export control laws as
a result of the ensuing furor.
   Iran and Iraq used chemical weapons during their nine-year war
that ended last year.
   Use of the chemical weapons prompted the United States to join
with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can
be used by Third World countries as weapons.

   Amending the Constitution is a difficult
process. Thousands of amendments have been proposed, but in more
than 200 years only 26 have been ratified.
   There are two ways to amend the Constitution, one initiated by
Congress and one by the state legislatures.
   Under the Constitution's Article V, a proposed amendment
originating in Congress must be approved by two-thirds votes in both
houses. It then must be approved by 38 state legislatures.
   Two-thirds of the state legislatures may call for a
constitutional convention. Any amendment approved by that convention
must then be ratified by three-fourths of the states.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran said
Tuesday his country is committed to peace talks with Iraq, but he
insisted the Persian Gulf rival give up occupied Iranian territory.
   ``We will support the talks if they lead to peace, but we cannot
find the necessary faith as long as the enemy is on our soil,''
Khamenei said in comments carried by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``How can they have pretensions to peace when they have kept
their forces on our soil?'' he said. ``Iraq must withdraw its forces
...''
   The eight years of fighting ended in August under a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire agreement. But talks on a permanent peace
remain deadlocked over several issues, including possession the
Shatt al-Arab waterway, prisoner exchanges and the withdrawal of
troops to pre-war borders.
   Iraqi troops still occupy about 380 square miles of Iranian
territory.
   The Iranian news agency said Khamenei's remarks came in a speech
to volunteer forces from throughout the nation. Khamenei was chosen
as Iran's senior leader after the June 3 death of revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The remarks follow a Saturday speech by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, who urged Iran to work for peace in the gulf region instead
of rebuilding its armed forces.
   Hussein also suggested the two sides exchange prisoners of war in
a goodwill gesture, but Khamenei did not address that point. An
estimated 100,000 soldiers remain to be repatriated.

<HEAD>Thai Military Says Cambodian Refugees to Be Returned to Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Thai security official said Tuesday
that a group of up to 600 Cambodian refugees would be returned to
the control of the communist Khmer Rouge, but the U.S. State
Department said that wouldn't happen.
   The refugees fled the Khmer Rouge camp of Kaiche after it was
heavily shelled in mid-April and traveled a few miles to Sok Sann
camp, run by the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, or KPNLF.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting Vietnamese
forces in Cambodia, wanted the refugees returned to Kaiche. But the
U.N. Border Relief Operation and the International Committee of the
Red Cross, which have reported widespread human rights violations in
Khmer Rouge camps, insisted the refugees be allowed to choose where
to live.
   The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
as a ``compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should be
moved to Site 8, the only Khmer Rouge camp where the guerrillas have
allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other
services. Site 8 is north of Kaiche, which is along the Cambodian
border and in Thailand's eastern Trat province.
   He could not say when the transfer would take place.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington
that the Thai government confirmed to U.S. officials that the
refugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistance
camps. She said this followed strong appeals from U.S. officials to
Thailand that the refugees not be returned to Khmer Rouge control
because their safety could not be assured.
   ``The United States goverment continues to be strongly opposed to
the return of these Cambodians to Khmer Rouge control,'' she said.
   A Western relief official, also speaking anonymously, called the
Thai decision a ``face-saving'' move in which the military would
avoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaiche yet still
continue support for the Khmer Rouge.
   ``The refugees should have individual choice,'' he said. ``Some
people have families in Sok Sann and they should stay in Sok Sann.
Some have families in Site 8 and they should go to Site 8. Some
people have reasons to flee Khmer Rouge control and they should not
be sent to Khmer Rouge control.''
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnamese forces
invaded and ousted it from power in late 1978. Washington says 2
million people, a fourth of the population, were executed or died of
famine in the Khmer Rouge's attempt to impose radical agrarian
communism.
   The Khmer Rouge fled to the border, established camps just inside
Thailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the KPNLF and of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Violations reported in Khmer Rouge refugee
camps included forcing children to porter arms through mine fields
and denying people emergency medical treatment.
   Western aid officials have been barred from Kaiche. The flight
from Kaiche was one of the largest escapes from a Khmer Rouge camp
in years, one relief official said.
   The refugees fled after gunners inside Cambodia rained heavy
shells on Kaiche and nearby Ta Luan camp. Relief officials believe
hundreds of people were hurt, but the Khmer Rouge refused to allow
any to be evacuated to outside hospitals.

   Climbing temperatures on Tuesday melted
blobs of heavy oil scattered over 21 miles of the Delaware River and
slowed down cleanup efforts already being challenged in court as too
slow.
   Coast Guard officials revised downward the number of gallons
spilled from 800,000 gallons to 306,684 gallons, based on new
assessments.
   A Uruguayan tanker went aground early Saturday, spilling No. 6
industrial heating oil. The oil coagulated in the cool water into
chunks, averaging about the size of a basketball but with some up to
2 and 3 feet across.
   Cleanup workers had been using pitchforks and even their hands to
snare the blobs of oil from the water while skimmers, jammed up by
the larger chucks, were deployed in areas of the river where there
were smaller lumps. The crews also have tried out fishing nets.
   ``When we've got it in chunks, we can pick it up,'' said Coast
Guard Capt. Larry Murdoch.
   But on Tuesday, the temperature headed into the 90s, the melting
range for the No. 6 industrial heating oil.
   During an inspection tour, officials pointed to patches where the
rainbow hue of petroleum on water showed up and said it was coming
from oil blobs close enough to the surface to heat and melt.
   The melting oil poses a much greater haal Guard, federal
government and private contract employees walking along the
shoreline and working out of 22 boats snaring the oil blobs.
   Coast Guard officials said they hoped to have more than 500
people involved in the cleanup Tuesday. But Roger A. Lucio of the
Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control
said 207 National Guard and private contractor employees were
working along with 100 federal government workers.
   The heat was reaching the point where officials also began to
worry about the cleanup workers.
   ``We ... have to recognize if we work them unreasonably in this
kind of weather, we can also do bad things to their health,''
Murdock said.

   President Bush said Tuesday he accepts some
responsibility for recently unearthed Reagan-era problems at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development since he was vice
president at the time.
   He also said that while he doesn't want to jump to conclusions,
congressional questioning of people close to him about influence
peddling on housing projects ``doesn't improve things'' in his
relationships with the men.
   ``If you want to assign blame to the vice president for what
happened over the past ... eight years, OK, that's fine, I accept
it,'' said the president during a news conference at the White House.
   Bush said he wants to make sure there is no recurrence of
``cronyism'' and ``special favors'' in awarding government contracts.
   ``That matter is being looked into by our very able, dedicated
Secretary of HUD and we are going to do everything we can to clean
up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur,'' said
Bush.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development has been rocked
in recent months by allegations that several Republican insiders and
former government officials were paid as consultants and developers
in the agency's moderate rehabilitation program.
   Bush said he would not single out anyone when asked specifically
about two men who were key aides in his presidential campaign last
year.
   Paul Manafort, an adviser to Bush's 1988 presidential campaign
manager, Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, told a
congressional panel last week that the more than $300,000 he earned
as a consultant on one project could indeed be characterized as
being for ``influence-peddling.''
   Frederick Bush, who was deputy chief of staff for then-Vice
President Bush, no relation, earlier testified before the same panel
about his role in another project.
   He has been asked to make a second appearance this week before
the House subcommittee on employment and housing to further clarify
his company's $260,000 consultant's fee on the Los Jazmines project
in Puerto Rico.
   The president was asked, ``Does this affect your relationship
with these people, to know that they were involved apparently in
influence peddling?''
   ``Well, it doesn't improve things, but on the other hand I want
to be fair,'' he answered. ``I want to be sure that I don't jump at
conclusions as to what guilt is and what it isn't, whether law was
broken or were people just out there, you know, doing what was
permitted.
   ``I want to have the standard higher, though, even if it's
permitted. I want to have the highest possible standard, but I
haven't put it on that kind of a personal basis yet,'' Bush said.
   The president praised HUD Secretary Jack Kemp for his work but
sidestepped placing blame on former Secretary Samuel Pierce for
problems at the agency.
   ``I am not about to prejudge the secretary himself. I assume that
he would accept responsibility for what happened _ past tense _ in
his department, just as I would have to assume responsibility for
something that goes on in my administration whether I know about it
or not,'' said Bush.
   ``The message has gone out loud and clear to every Cabinet
officer that we want the highest possible ethical standards,'' Bush
added.
   HUD Inspector General Paul Adams has said at least a dozen
private escrow agents nationwide are under investigation for
possible embezzlement of millions of dollars of HUD funds.
   Bush said he has met with investigators and encouraged
independence and thoroughness in their work.
   His statement came as reports revealed the U.S. attorney in
Atlanta is seeking $7.5 million in damages from two agents accused
of keeping more than $1 million in proceeds from real estate
closings there.
   In Maryland, Marilyn Harrell, an escrow agent dubbed ``Robin
HUD'' by investigators, has admitted she stole $5.5 million from HUD
closings she conducted.
   Harrell has turned over her Temple Hills, Md., home to the agency
to compensate for part of her theft.
   Mike Norton, the U.S. attorney in Denver also is investigating
allegations that a suspended HUD accountant embezzled $1 million in
housing funds.
   Meanwhile HUD announced $89.2 million in new grants Tuesday to
private, non-profit and government sponsors to develop 131 projects
nationwide in a demonstration transitional housing program for the
homeless.

   Glenn Michael Souther may have been a Soviet
spy, but it's unlikely he was a Russian mole who infiltrated this
country, his former associates said Tuesday after Souther's death
was reported in the Soviet Union.
   Rather, he was a rambuctious young American who satisfied his
craving for attention by defecting to the Soviet Union three years
ago, a decision that may have cost him his life, they said.
   ``They used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they
were going to finish with him, they finished with him,'' said
Barbara Fahey, a professor's wife who knew Souther when he was an
Old Dominion University student.
   Souther, 32, was a former Navy intelligence specialist who
disappeared shortly after he graduated from ODU in May 1986 with a
degree in Russian. He appeared on Soviet television last July and
said he had defected. The Soviet military newspaper Red Star
reported Tuesday that Souther was a KGB agent named Mikhail Orlov
and that he died unexpectedly June 22.
   ``There's some attempt to imply that he was really a Soviet-born
citizen and became a mole, but that was never really stated and I
don't believe it's true,'' said Ronald Kessler, a Maryland author
who is writing a book on Souther.
   ``He was in fact a very successful spy,'' Kessler said in a
telephone interview from his home in Potomac. ``He was an American
mole. It's possible that he took this Russian name after he
defected.''
   ODU professors who taught Souther said he was an outgoing,
well-liked student who started out poorly in his Russian major.
   ``There was, throughout the years, not a single indication that
he could have been not an American,'' said Leonid I. Mihalap, a
Soviet-born professor who taught Souther Russian. ``He did not look
Slavic and besides he didn't drink vodka.''
   But Mihalap said he reread one of Souther's final papers in
Russian and was surprised that it was grammatically flawless except
for one misspelling.
   ``His Russian was better than what I taught him,'' he said.
   Fran Hassencahl, Souther's speech professor at ODU, said he
talked often about his childhood in the Midwest and she met several
members of his family. She said she understood that he had married a
Russian woman and his mother had visited him in the Soviet Union.
   Kessler, who said he has obtained evidence of Souther's spying,
said he received a letter from Souther this month in response to the
writer's request for an interview.
   ``He said, `According to your letter you have already convicted
me of espionage: guilty until proven innocent' and then he said that
due to that he didn't want to be interviewed but would respond in
writing to questions,'' Kessler said.
   John Fahey, a retired Navy commander who taught Souther Russian
at ODU, said Souther loved to clown and play pranks.
   One of Souther's pranks may have led to his decision to defect,
Fahey said. Because he was suspended from ODU in 1984 for biting a
female student on the neck, Souther was turned down for officer
candidate school in the Navy.
   ``He was very bitter about what happened to him as far as the
problem on campus,'' Fahey said. ``He really wanted to become a
naval officer.''

<HEAD>European Leaders Plan for Monetary Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European leaders made a deal Tuesday to take
the first steps toward economic and monetary union, but Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain fended off moves for a single
currency and one central bank.
   Leaders of the 12-nation European Economic Community fell far
short of embracing sweeping proposals that would lead to tight
economic integration of the trading bloc.
   ``We've made as much progress as we can at this stage while
leaving longer term issues for further discussion,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said at the end of a two-day summit.
   Mrs. Thatcher was pitted against French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wanted a
quick monetary marriage.
   Despite their differences, the leaders praised the agreement to
coordinate more closely their economic and monetary policies.
   Kohl described the summit outcome as ``superb.''
   ``The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the
EEC further together and brings political union one step nearer,''
he said.
   Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said, ``A week ago, I
would have said this would have been impossible.''
   Jacques Delors, a top Common Market official who championed
radical plans for monetary unity, said, ``I can say the (community)
is moving forward.''
   The leaders expanded the Common Market's drive to fashion a
single market by the end of 1992. By that date, the nations hope to
remove the many trade barriers that block the free movement of
people, goods, services and money.
   In their final statement, the leaders said they decided ``the
first stage of the realization of economic and monetary union would
begin on July 1, 1990.''
   They asked Common Market officials to complete measures required
for the initial phase, which generally stresses greater cooperation
on economic and monetary issues.
   In agreeing only on greater economic coordination, the leaders
failed to back wholeheartedly a report, pushed by Delors, setting
out three stages for a monetary union.
   They did, however, agree to start work on a special conference to
alter their founding treaty. Such changes would be necessary to set
up a European-wide central bank system and joint currency.
   Delors said the unity movement ``has been started, and I'm
tempted to say it's irreversible and will lead to economic and
monetary union.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said, however, ``There is absolutely nothing
automatic about going beyond stage one. All that is for future
decisions.''
   The leaders also sidestepped the touchy question of a proposed
``Social Charter'' to set out minimum rights for workers in the new
European-wide market.
   Mrs. Thatcher, a conservative, had criticized the proposal as a
socialist move.
   ``We have agreed at this (summit) that it can't be done now and
we have said it is all for further discussion,'' she said.
   But Gonzalez said the plan had not been shelved.
   The agreement for further discussion, he said, ``constitutes a
clearing of the way to continue working for social rights.''
   Also Tuesday, the EEC leaders called for an embargo on arms sales
to China and urged the World Bank to postpone new loans to that
country to protest the government's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   They also froze visits by high-level EEC members to Beijing,
extended visas of Chinese students in Europe and placed limits on
cultural and scientific exchange programs.
   The leaders also called for the participation of the Palestine
Liberation Organization in any U.N.-sponsored peace conference on
the Middle East.
   The declaration spoke of the ``continuing deterioration of the
situation'' in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and
called on Israeli authorities ``to end repressive measures'' in the
territories.
   The 18-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of
the territories has claimed 539 Palestinian and 23 Israeli lives.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
disappointment with the EEC's Middle East declaration.
   EEC members are Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark,
Luxembourg, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and
Ireland.

   While residents of southeastern Texas
remember Tropical Storm Allison for flooded homes and cars, serious
water-lovers will talk about the gnarly waves the radical storm
brought.
   ``This is a dream, right here!'' surfer Scott Cannary, 22, said
gleefully Monday when he rushed to the city's seawall to take
advantage of the rare fast, high waves. ``This is the best time.''
   A few blocks away, Ron Smith, 21, said he and a group of friends
rushed from League City for the same reason that Cannary braved the
storm.
   ``Big waves! Big, big ones!'' he said.
   Smith said Monday's waves were 4 feet high, a vast improvement
over the 1- to 2-foot waves that prevail on the upper Texas coast.
   Lt. Vic Maceo, director of the Galveston County Sheriff's
Department beach patrol, said his staff allowed no swimming on
Galveston Island beaches but would allow experienced surfers in the
water.
   ``You can tell immediately who they are,'' Maceo said.

   Nine more people were put on trial for rioting
during the suppression of China's democracy movement, including one
accused of disemboweling a dead soldier, official media reported
Tuesday.
   Also on Tuesday, officials investigated a train explosion that
killed 24 people, with state television saying it was caused by
dynamite.
   China's legislature is scheduled to convene Thursday to endorse
the hard line against dissent that began with the army assault June
3-4 on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   U.S. officials said China had asked the United States to delay
the start of a Peace Corps program, under which 20 Americans were to
teach English in Sichuan province. The action was the latest
cultural exchange to be threatened or suspended because of the
crackdown.
   President Bush told a news conference in Washington on Tuesday
that China remains a country of strategic importance to America but
a `normalized relationship'' is impossible so long as the harsh
crackdown on dissent continues. He expressed regret over China's
decision not to accept American Peace Corps volunteers for the time
being.
   Among the nine defendants in the latest trial, which began Monday
in Beijing, was Zhang Jianzhong, 26. The Beijing Daily said he took
party in the demonstrations since April 17 and, when the army moved
in, slit a dead soldier's stomach open with a piece of glass.
   It said another defendant, Bai Xinyu, set fire to two armored
personnel carriers and tried to incite other people to riot. It said
Bai, 60, had a criminal record covering 30 years and had served two
prison terms for murder.
   News reports said charges against the seven other defendants
included arson, robbery and theft.
   More than 1,800 people have been arrested for participating in
what the government calls ``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' during
the June 3-4 army attack in Beijing, and 27 have been executed.
   The government says 300 people were killed in the assault, most
of them soldiers. Diplomatic and intelligence estimates range up to
3,000 and say nearly all the dead were unarmed civilians.
   Investigators examined the wreckage of a train blown off the
tracks by an explosion Monday night on its way from Hangzhou to
Shanghai.
   News reports said at least 24 people were killed and 11 seriously
wounded by the explosion in a third-class coach about 20 miles from
Shanghai, China's second-largest city.
   State TV showed a huge hole in the side of the car and said
dynamite exploded in a toilet.
   It was not clear whether the explosion was retaliation for the
executions in Shanghai last week of three men who set fire to a
train that killed six people when it crashed through a barricade set
up by protesters.
   The National People's Congress is to endorse both the tough new
policy and recent changes in the Communist Party leadership.
   On Saturday Jiang Zemin, former mayor and party boss in Shanghai,
became national party chief in place of Zhao Ziyang, who was seen as
too soft on the student protesters.
   Western diplomats said Tuesday that Jiang, an economic pragmatist
who supports the aging leadership's rigid position on dissent, ran
the propaganda campaign to convince the people the crackdown was
necessary.
   For days after the weekend of violence, television showed
``thugs'' smashing windows of army trucks and setting military
vehicles ablaze.
   An old revolutionary gave a ringing endorsement Tuesday to senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, who apparently ordered the represssion.
   While the turmoil allegedly supported by Zhao nearly engulfed the
nation, ``it is with Comrade Xiaoping being at the helm that this
matter has been promptly solved,'' former President Li Xiannian, 80,
told a Communist Party meeting, according to the official news
agency Xinhua.
   Wan Li, chairman of the legislature, said it would speed up
China's program of economic reform, which Deng began a decade ago,
after studying mistakes that had been made.
   He said the government was stable and in control, and the unrest
``has made us sober-mindedly draw experience from the past and look
forward to the future.''
   Helen Qubain, 21, of Buena Vista, Fla., and Mark Radicia, 25, of
Omaha, Neb., a student and a teacher at Nankai University in
Tianjin, were accused of being deeply involved in the democracy
movement there and were ordered to leave China by Friday.
   Eleven missionaries from an organization called the Latter Reign
Ministry of Litchfield, Ill., were accused of distributing religious
literature illegally. They also were given a Friday deadline.

   The makers of ``Big Wheel'' riding toys will
replace the ``on'' switch for 39,000 of the battery-powered vehicles
because of possible burns from overheated switches or loss of
control due to stuck switches, the Consumer Product Safey Commission
said Tuesday.
   The CPSC said the free replacement offer by Empire of Carolina
Inc. of Tarboro, N.C., covers toys sold nationwide from 1986 to
1988. The models covered by the replacement offer are Kawasaki KLT
250 ``Prairie Big Wheel,'' Nos. 1215, 1220 and 1223, and
``Sweet-Tee-Nuff Big Wheel,'' No. 1221.
   To get a replacement, owners should call Empire toll-free at
1-800-334-5666, or if in North Carolina, collect at 1-919-823-4111.
Or they can write: Empire Campaign, c@o Empire of Carolina Inc.,
P.O. Box 427, Daniel Street Extension, Tarboro, N.C. 27886.
   The ``on switch'' is on the handlebar and is pushed down to drive
the toy, which can travel up to 5 mph. The toy should stop when the
button is released.
   Empire and the CPSC said they know of five instances in which the
switch overheated or burned out, and one in which the switch stuck
and the operator could not stop the toy. Minor burns were reported
in two of the incidents.

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov bowed to pressure from
the new legislature Tuesday and withdrew seven Cabinet nominations.
It was the first time elected Soviet representatives had kept such
officials from taking office.
   Six of the nominees were rejected in first-ever confirmation
hearings last week by committees of the 542-member Supreme Soviet,
which replaced the old rubber-stamp body this year.
   Ryzhkov also withdrew his nominee, not identified, to head the
Ministry of Instrument-Making, Automation Equipment and Control
Systems, and said he had no nominee to lead the government
environmental agency.
   He could have taken the fight for his first choices to the full
Supreme Soviet this week, but said in a speech to the lawmakers that
he would submit new candidates.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the Supreme Soviet later
confirmed 60 nominees for posts in government ministries and
committees.
   The new Supreme Soviet is the country's first full-time
representative legislature, a branch of the larger Congress of
People's Deputies chosen this spring in the first national
multiple-candidate elections.
   The six nominees rejected after committee hearings were Culture
Minister Vasily G. Zakharov; Gennady P. Bogomyakov, nominee for
minister of the oil and gas industry; Polad A. Polad-Zade for
minister of land reclamation and water management, a controversial
department in charge of dams and canals; Marat V. Gramov for head of
the sports committee; Lira I. Rozenova for the price committee, and
Vladimir G. Gribov for head of the central bank.
   Ryzhkov said candidates for a first deputy premiership and head
of a new Commission on Food and Purchases were withdrawn during
other committee work.
   He indicated the nomination of one first deputy premier, Lev A.
Voronin, still was active but did not say which of the candidates
for the other two deputy premierships, Yuri D. Maslyukov or Vladimir
I. Kalashnikov, was dropped.
   A Supreme Soviet committee rejected Kalashnikov as head of the
food commission, however, so he may have been the one.
   The premier said he had no nominee for the top position at the
State Committee for the Protection of Nature, now held by Fyodor T.
Morgun.
   In response to a question, Ryzhkov said four scientists had been
offered the job but turned it down. He said nothing about Morgun.
   In other action in the Supreme Soviet:
   _ The environmental protection budget will quadruple to about
$612 billion for the next 15 years, and factories will face
pollution fines starting in 1991. U.S. businesses, citizens and the
government spent $71.4 billion in 1987 for pollution abatement, the
U.S. Commerce Department recently reported.
   _ The Supreme Soviet will ``work out a political assessment'' of
the 1979 decision to send Soviet troops into Afghanistan and report
to the next session of the Congress. The Soviet forces, which backed
Kabul in its fight with U.S.-and Pakistan-supported Moslem
guerrillas, were withdrawn in February.
   _ The legislative agenda for this 40-day summer session includes
new laws on consumer protection, inventions, the court system, the
press, taxes, citizen associations, the criminal code and economic
reform, and first readings of new laws on trade unions, youth,
freedom of conscience and religious organizations.
   Some deputies called for consideration of land-owning _ now
reserved exclusively to the government _ and on the state's response
to emergencies. The last was apparently in reference to
congressional debate on the use of troops to clear a demonstration
in Soviet Georgia in April. At least 20 people died in the Georgian
unrest.
   Vladimir Lapygin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee on
defense and the KGB, told the newspaper Izvestia the heads of these
agencies will report to his committee. Lapygin also said lawmakers
should consider eliminating the military draft in favor of a
professional army.

<TEXT>
   A 37-ton Hercules cargo plane, salvaged from
Antarctic ice and snow more than 16 years after it crashed, is set
to arrive in California this week, officials said Tuesday.
   ``The airplane is just in the final stages of rework at Air New
Zealand in Christchurch,'' U.S. Navy Cmdr. Keith Armstrong said by
telephone from Point Mugu Naval Air Station, about 50 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   The huge, once-icebound LC-130 Hercules is expected to arrive
Friday at the Navy's Antarctic Development Squadron 6, the
``Puckered Penguins,'' who fly support missions for the National
Science Foundation in Antarctica.
   So far, about $4.2 million has been spent to excavate the plane
and overhaul it, said Guy Guthridge, a National Science Foundation
spokesman in Washington.
   An additional $2.8 million still must be spent to install new
electronic equipment at Cherry Point, N.C., Guthridge added. But
that's cheaper than the $35 million price tag for a replacement
plane.
   The aircraft is specifically designed and equipped to operate in
polar climates, including the use of one-ton, teflon-coated
``wheel-skis'' needed to break the grip of ice on takeoff.
   ``We left the plane there in '71 because we simply had no
capability in place to go back to a remote location in extremely
cold weather and retrieve it,'' Guthridge said.
   The Hercules was one of seven owned by the foundation, and its
loss ``affected our ability to install science projects in the
field, which really is the payoff of our program,'' Guthridge said.
   Over a 42-day period the cargo plane was dug from the snow that
had buried all but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot high tail
and it flew out on Jan. 10, 1988.
   Much of the time since then was spent in Christchurch, New
Zealand, where it was inspected and renovated before it is returned
to the United States, Guthridge said.
   ``A lot of people were worried that the stresses induced by the
aircraft being covered in snow would damage the air frame,''
Guthridge said.
   But the salvage crew was surprised to find that the below-zero
climate, with air too frigid to carry moisture, had preserved the
Lockheed aircraft amazingly well, said Joe Dabney, a spokesman for
the manufacturer in Marietta, Ga.
   ``It was in effect just frozen, with no deterioration in the
structure,'' Dabney said.
   Lockheed engineers found many of the hydraulic systems were still
working, the electronics still worked, there still was air in the
tires and fuel in the tanks, Dabney said.
   The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site,
about 700 miles from McMurdo Sound, after supplying fuel and other
supplies to a scientific team measuring snow accumulation on the
East Antarctic Plateau.
   The field team, part of a joint American, French and Soviet
effort, was in a rugged area of high winds and snow accumulation,
said Winifred Reuning, National Science Foundation spokeswoman.
   The pilot was forced to abort on takeoff after a jet
malfunctioned, Ms. Reuning said.
   The pilot managed a crash landing, damaging the front landing ski
and nose of the aircraft. But the crew and several French scientists
who were aboard walked away without injury.

   Florida's privacy laws should be
extended to minors, a lawyer told the state Supreme Court Tuesday in
the case of a teen-ager forced to ask a judge to allow an abortion
without parental consent.
   ``The statute clearly fails to protect a minor's privacy right,''
attorney Jerri Blair told the justices. ``A minor who is pregnant
has a right to submit to any medical procedure except abortion under
Florida law.
   ``There is no question it should be applied to the minor's
abortion decision,'' Ms. Blair told reporters later.
   The Florida law requires unmarried minors to get permission from
their parents or a judge before having an abortion.
   The case argued Tuesday began when Ms. Blair's client, a
15-year-old known only as ``T.W.,'' did not want to tell her parents
about her pregnancy _ then in its 11th week _ and sought judicial
permission for an abortion.
   A Lake County judge denied her request last month, saying the
state law was vague and unworkable. An appeals court then ruled the
law unconstitutional, and a series of legal maneuvers landed the
case in the U.S. Supreme Court, which returned the case to state
justices without comment.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has left the law unenforceable until the
Florida high court reviews it.
   Suporters of the law contend it protects the unborn and the right
of parents to supervise their children.
   ``When you elevate the right of privacy over the right to life,
you have elevated an inferior right over a superior right,'' said
Ken Connor, a Tallahassee attorney for Florida Right to Life.
``Without the right to life, there is no right to privacy.''
   Attorney James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, Ind., who served as
guardian for the fetus, argued that minors are not mature enough to
make decisions about abortion.
   ``I don't believe the people of Florida intended to subvert
parental rights (or) to subvert the state's traditional interest in
protecting innocent human life, and withdraw the ability of the
state to protect vulnerable minors when they adopted the 1980
Florida right of privacy,'' Bopp said.
   A ruling by the seven justices could be weeks away as the court
begins its annual vacation period next month. The court's decision
could affect thousands of unmarried pregnant teens and possibly set
a broad precedent, attorneys said.
   Similar privacy issues dominate a case pending before the U.S.
Supreme Court and the original 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision giving
women the right to have abortions.
   Before Florida's parental consent law was declared
unconstitutional, 60 teen-agers received judicial permission for an
abortion.

   Amnesty International said Tuesday that rulings by

retarded offenders are a step backward for human rights.
   In two 5-4 votes, the Supreme Court said Monday the
Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit
execution of people who committed crimes as young as 16, or adults
with the reasoning capacity of children.
   ``The imposition of death sentences on juvenile offenders was in
clear contravention of international human rights treaties and
standards including the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights, both
of which the U.S. government signed in 1977 but has not ratified,''
Amnesty International said.
   The London-based group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977,
said the death penalty was particularly inappropriate for
individuals who had not attained full physical or emotional maturity
at the time of their crimes.
   ``To impose the death penalty in such cases, whether as
retribution or as an intended deterrent, violates basic principles
of humanity,'' the group's statement said.
   Amnesty International noted that 72 countries that retain the
death penalty have abolished it for criminals under the age of 18,
including the Soviet Union, South Africa, Syria, Paraguay and Libya.
   Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran are among the countries that
have executed people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes,
Amnesty International said.

   Leftist rebels Tuesday took
responsiblity for the assassination of an army colonel and said he
participated in rightist death squads.
   Col. Roberto Rivera, director of the National Firemen's Corps
since June 1, was slain Monday as he drove to work.
   He was previously director of the Public Security Academy and
assistant director of Treasury Police.
   ``Col. Rivera was a military man with a criminal and repressive
trajectory,'' said a rebel communique broadcast on the clandestine
Radio Venceremos. ``His activity was clearly linked to death
squads.''
   A nine-year civil war between the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, known as FMLN, and the U.S.-backed government has
left an estimated 70,000 people dead. Human rights groups say more
than 20,000 people were killed by military-linked rightist death
squads in the early 1980s.
   ``The FMLN reiterates that the `dirty war' actions of the
government against civilans will receive a firm response from the
people in arms,'' said the rebel communique.
   In Washington, the State Department on Tuesday renewed its appeal
to the rebels to negotiate with the government on ending the civil
war in a statement prompted by Monday's slaying.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted that Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani has formed a national commission to talk
to the guerrilla movement.
   ``We repeat our call to the FMLN to end the violence in El
Salvador and to enter into negotiations without preconditions aimed
at ending the conflict,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

<TEXT>
   The executive director of the National Women's
Hall of Fame said Tuesday that the board had no qualms about
accepting $35,000 from a cigarette company to keep the financially
ailing museum open.
   In fact, Sally Parr said the board of the Seneca Falls, N.Y.,
museum approached Philip Morris Cos. and was rateful for its help.
   But the decision to accept the money has drawn stinging criticism
from a leading feminist who said cigarettes are killing women.
   ``Women's organizations are going to have to stop taking money
from the merchants of death,'' Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, said Monday.
   Parr said at a news conference Tuesday that the $10,000 in cash
and $25,000 worth of public relations and fund-raising services from
Philip Morris gave the museum ``a starting point to move on.''
   Philip Morris spokeswoman Posie DiSesa said the company didn't
expect any promotion from the museum in exchange for the donation.
   The museum board launched an urgent fund-raising drive June 13,
saying the Hall of Fame would close if $100,000 wasn't raised by
June 30.
   The board announced Monday that the $35,000 donation from Philip
Morris and a $100,000 Gannett Foundation grant would keep the shrine
alive. The private, non-profit educational institute was $68,000 in
debt before the drive.
   The National Women's Hall of Fame, founded in 1968, is in an old
bank building in the upstate New York village that bills itself as
``The Birthplace of Women's Rights.''
   Women's rights pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton and 300 other women
met there in 1848 to issue a ``Declaration of Sentiments,'' which
demanded the right to vote, equal schooling and wages.
   Despite her displeasure with the Philip Morris donation, Yard
said it was important to keep the hall open.
   ``It's the only place in the country where there's any attempt to
keep records of leading American women,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush urged Americans Tuesday to thank
God for their freedom on the Fourth of July and celebrate ``the
resounding success'' of their 213-year-old experiment in democracy.
   ``To every American citizen, here and abroad, Happy Fourth of
July!'' Bush said in an Independence Day message.
   ``The Fourth of July is a day to pause and thank God that men
such as Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin had the strength, courage
and insight to forge a nation predicated upon the noble ideal, `that
all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights,''' Bush said.
   ``After 213 years, Americans can say that the experiment is a
resounding success,'' said Bush. ``The Fourth of July is a time to
rejoice in this success, which has inspired all who seek to break
the shackles of totalitarian rule and breathe in the life-giving air
of liberty.''
   As a boy growing up in Connecticut, ``the Fourth of July
represented the best of holidays. It held the promise of parades,
picnics and fireworks,'' Bush said.
   ``More important, however, it introduced a small boy to the
promise of America,'' said the president. ``Everywhere I turned, I
would see the red, white and blue of our flag.
   ``As a grew older, I realized that the flag has reminded
generations of Americans how fortunate we are to live in a free and
democratic republic,'' said Bush, who said Tuesday he will seek a
constitutional amendment to overturn a Supreme Court ruling that
struck down flag desecration laws. ``It is a banner respected around
the world.''
   Bush will leave Friday for his oceanfront home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, to spend the holiday with family and friends. He will return
to Washington on Wednesday July 5.

<HEAD>Grosz Says He Wants To Quit As Party Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karoly Grosz, his power curbed in a new
four-man leadership dominated by reformers, was quoted Tuesday as
saying he plans to resign as Communist Party chief next year.
   Mai Nap, an independent afternoon daily, quoted Grosz as saying
in an interview he ``will no longer be general secretary'' after
parliamentary elections scheduled for 1990. He has held the post 13
months.
   ``We have to make room for the younger generation,'' the paper
quoted him as saying. ``Obviously, I'll continue to be engaged in
politics at some level, but I never again want to be a general
secretary.''
   Rezsoe Nyers, father of pioneering economic reforms in the late
1960s, was chosen as party chairman Saturday, and a four-man
Presidium was formed to run the party until the Communist Party
Congress scheduled for Oct. 7.
   The paper quoted Grosz as saying the Central Committee had
``agreed that we will need to hold (another) Congress after the
elections as well. It's obvious that there will be a new balance of
forces and a new leadership.''
   Grosz, considered a centrist, has lost standing recently with
contradictory statements.
   He angered other leading Communists, and many other Hungarians,
when he said on television May 30 there was no need to rehabilitate
Imre Nagy, who led the 1956 uprising crushed by Soviet tanks,
because Nagy's execution was ``not a party decision.''
   A day later, party issued a statement that described Nagy as a
forerunner of reform and amounted to de facto rehabilitation. Nagy
since has been reburied with honors.
   Grosz replaced Janos Kadar as party chief in May 1988, heading a
new leadership that seemed to strike a balance between reformers and
more orthodox Communists.
   As reformers gained the upper hand over conservatives wary of
relinquishing power, Grosz jockeyed unsuccessfully for a middle
ground.
   Communists and democratic opposition groups agreed to cooperate
in drafting legislation to govern the first multiparty elections in
more than 40 years, and work began June 13.
   The government has said elections will be held by June of next
year, but there have been increasing calls for the date to be
advanced.

<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday endorsed and sent to the
Senate legislation that would give final approval to a
self-government plan for the Western Pacific islands of Palau.
   The measure, passed on a voice vote, also provides final
authorization for spending of $238 million over the next five years,
including an immediate $36 million payment to cover Palau's debt for
a power plant.
   ``This is a highly responsible act for the United States,'' said
Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   The measure ``brings an honorable end to a very difficult chapter
in the history of the United States in the Western Pacific,'' said
Ron de Lugo, the non-voting House delegate from the Virgin Islands.
   Palau is the last of four parts of the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands, created following World War II, to define its
political status. The plan, called the Compact of Free Association,
provides self-government in all areas except defense, which is
reserved for the United States.
   The United States also retains a 50-year right to establish a
military base on Palau should it need an alternative to its current
bases in the Philippines.
   Palau itself has failed in six referendums to approve the
compact, and the bill provides another $200,000 to hold a seventh
referendum.
   The island nation has been troubled by political corruption,
crippling debts and fiscal mismanagement, drug abuse and crumbling
public facilities. The legislation would create a anti-drug program
for Palau and establishes controls for the spending of U.S. aid
money.
   The House acted despite warnings from Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
who argued that the United States doesn't have the money to spend.
``We are playing fast and loose with our budget agreement. We are
squeezing things in and declaring them emergencies,'' he said.
   In a separate action, the House also approved and sent to the
Senate a bill establishing regular diplomatic relations with two
other former Pacific trusteeships, the Marshall Islands and
Micronesia. The measure would elevate the status of the U.S. envoys
in those two island groups to ambassador.

   The House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday
slashed $1.1 billion from President Bush's proposed Star Wars budget
and cut funds for the B-2 stealth bomber to save a Marine aircraft
the administration wants to cancel.
   Beginning full committee action on the $295.6 billion Pentagon
budget for fiscal 1990, the Democratic-controlled panel did side
with Bush on some issues.
   It rejected an amendment introduced by Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., to terminate the Midgetman missile program. And it voted
to restore $71 million for the Lance missile and other short-range
attack weapons _ money that had been cut by a subcommittee.
   By voice vote, the full committee approved a $3.5 billion budget
for the Strategic Defense Initiative, considerably less than the
$4.6 billion Bush had proposed for the Star Wars program to develop
lasers and other weapons to stop enemy nuclear missiles.
   The committee decision came just two months after Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, in slashing $10 billion from the budget, had
already cut $1 billion in proposed Star Wars spending. The committee
action, if supported in later votes in the House and Senate, would
take $1.1 billion more.
   By a 39-12 vote largely along party lines, the committee rejected
an amendment by Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., to accept Cheney's
spending level for Star Wars.
   ``I believe the American people will support a strong, robust SDI
program,'' Kyl told his committee colleagues before the amendment
was defeated.
   One of Cheney's most controversial budget decisions was scuttling
the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, a revolutionary aircraft designed to
take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane.
   His move met with stiff opposition in Congress where last week
Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., succeeded in
persuading the Research and Development Subcommittee to approve an
amendment to pump $351 million into the program by taking money that
had been earmarked for the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.
   Rep. William L. Dickinson, R-Ala., introduced an amendment to
restore some of the funds for the bomber. But Weldon argued that the
amendment ``in effect kills the V-22.'' His argument succeeded as
the committee voted 31-19 to reject Dickinson's amendment.
   The vote leaves $2.7 billion in procurement funds for the B-2
bomber and cuts the proposed $1.8 billion for research and
development to about $1.5 billion.
   Three committee members _ Reps. John Kasich, R-Ohio; John
Rowland, R-Conn., and Dellums _ plan to introduce an amendment
Wednesday to eliminate all money for the aircraft, which is
considered one of the most expensive in history at a cost of between
$500 million and $650 million a copy.
   After the committee rejected the administration's requested
figure for Star Wars Tuesday, Kasich proposed spending $3.8 billion
plus inflation on SDI, reaching that level by cutting added items
including a proposed $200 million for the National Aerospace Plane.
The high-speed transport could fly around the world in two hours.
   Kasich's amendment lost 32-15, largely along party lines.
   The panel didn't take up other Star Wars amendments, reasoning
that there was no need to engage in rancorous debate at this point
over an issue that is expected to reach the House floor for full
discussion next month.
   At that time, Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., plans to introduce an
amendment cutting Star Wars to $3.1 billion, and Dellums, chairman
of the subcommittee, plans a measure limiting fiscal 1990 funds to
$1.3 billion for SDI.
   Dellums said that based on ``the reality over the past few
years,'' the research and development total for Star Wars will
likely be cut on the House floor to $2.8 billion.
   The committee on Tuesday also rejected a surprise amendment by
Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., to eliminate money for the Army's light
attack helicopter, commonly known as the LHX.
   ``Santa Claus should not come to town every day,'' Hopkins said
in response to arguments that funds for Army research and
development projects were drastically low and the service deserved a
modernized force.
   His amendment failed, 41-8.
   In approving the research and development budget, the panel also
approved $50 million for the Defense Advance Research Projects
Agency to spend on high definition television. The agency has $10
million available annually for the program during the next three
years.
   Earlier, the full House committee approved the Seapower and
Strategic and Critical Materials Subcommittee's budget of about $14
billion for shipbuilding, two additional mine-sweepers and other
items.

<HEAD>Kidnappings May Have Been a Mistake, Hezbollah Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The kidnapping of foreigners, 14 of whom
are believed still held in Lebanon, may have been ``a very big
mistake,'' said a spokesman for Shiite Moslems thought to be the
captors' umbrella group.
   Ibrahim Amin, the spokesman for Hezbollah, or Party of God said:
``It is possible that we might feel that some acts might have
involved a very big mistake.
   ``But we have to face our mistakes in the way that preserves and
respects our society,'' Amin said.
   Hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the kidnappings,
and the black-turbaned Amin reiterated those denials at a news
conference. But Western and local intelligence sources have linked
the organization to extremist groups who claim responsibility in
most of the abductions.
   Hezbollah supported the anti-West policies of Iran's late
spiritual leader and founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who died of a heart attack on June 3. It was
unclear whether Hezbollah's attitudes would change with his death.
   Hezbollah has declared support for Iranian President Ali
Khamenei, who was appointed Khomeini's successor as supreme leader.
   Among those held are nine Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Mormons gathered Tuesday to
dedicate a $1 million shrine on the ``hallowed spot'' where church
founder Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob
145 years ago.
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson; Jayne Thompson, wife of
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, and about 3,000 others attended a
ceremony marking the completed restoration of the old Carthage jail
where Smith died _ a site considered sacred by the world's 6.5
million Mormons.
   ``Few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood
stained the floor of this jail,'' said Gordon Hinckley, first
counselor to Benson, as he recounted the shooting of the Smiths on
June 27, 1844.
   ``We are grateful for the reconciliation that has come with the
passage of time,'' said Hinckley, who described the founder's death
as ``an epic story of martyrdom.''
   ``This is a hallowed spot,'' Hinckley said.
   The five-room, bullet-riddled jail stands as a reminder of the
religious persecution of the Mormons and the hatred that drove them
from the Mississippi River town of Nauvoo, 30 miles west, he said.
   The two-story stone jail, with its two cells and the bedroom
where the Smiths died, has been restored to its 1844 appearance.
   Bullet holes are still visible in the bedroom door and Hyrum
Smith's blood-stained cloths are on display, along with a statue of
the Smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotes from Joseph
Smith.
   Renovation of the jail, built in 1840, was completed to coincide
with the 150th anniversary of the Mormon's settlement in Nauvoo, a
town of about 1,100 located 200 miles north of St. Louis that
briefly was home to Smith's followers _ the core of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sains.
   Smith and his congregation arrived in Nauvoo in 1839, when the
town was named Commerce.
   They settled on 1,000 acres in the swamp ``flats'' below the
town's main business district. The land was drained and divided into
four-acre farm plots. Each member was given an acre for a house,
barn and a few animals.
   Within a few years, a city of 15,000 sprang from the swamp.
   Named Nauvoo by the Mormons _ from the Hebrew for ``beautiful
location'' _ it rivaled Chicago as the largest city in Ilinois. A
huge, limestone temple was built on a bluff overlooking the town.
   But the friction with outsiders that had forced Smith to leave
other towns followed the settlers into Illinois.
   Mormons clashed with local residents who rejected Smith's claims
that he had spoken with God, been visited by angels and was a
prophet.
   The conflict eventually led to the arrest of the Smiths and two
associates.
   They were awaiting trial in Carthage when the jail was stormed by
a mob estimated by some accounts at 125.
   ``The historic preservation of this site will foster an ongoing
growth of tolerance which is Illinois and America,'' Mrs. Thompson
said.
   After the deaths of the Smiths, Brigham Young assumed leadership
of the church and two years later led a mass exodus west from
Nauvoo, eventually settling in Salt Lake City.

   Burma's military government said on
government radio and television Monday that it will act under
martial law to stop unauthorized organizations from printing and
distributing books and pamphlets.
   The announcement said there were ``48 unauthorized organizations
engaged in activities aimed at disturbing peace and tranquility in
the country and also printing and distributing pamphlets illegally.''
   The government added that ``51 similar unauthorized organizations
are also operating in the name of students organizations.''
   ``Legally registered political and other organizations can apply
for registration under the ... law .. and ask for exemption to print
and distribute books and pamphlets purely for election purposes,''
it said.
   It said 226 political parties were registered with the Election
Commission and 57 social organizations with the Ministry of Home and
Religious Affairs.
   The military government, which seized power last September, has
promised a general election next year,
   Karen rebel sources in Mae Sot, Thailand, said up to 900 Burmese
soldiers backed by mortar and artillery fire attacked Karen
guerrilla positions close to the Thai frontier before dawn Tuesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said heavy
fighting followed at the Karen base of Pa Loo, about eight miles
south of Mae Sot.
   Soldiers fired hundreds of mortar and artillery shells into Pa
Loo and a nearby camp at Kaw Moo Ra, they said. The Moei River
separates the camps from Thailand.
   More than 50 shells fell into Thailand near Pa Loo and Burmese
machine-gun fire hit three houses and a Buddhist temple in Mae Kone
Kane village, Thai border patrol police said, adding that Thai
security forces returned fire.
   No casualty reports were available.
   The Karens are among a dozen ethnic groups in Burma which for 40
years have fought for greater autonomy. The Karens, with about 8,000
armed fighters, are the largest group.
   Government forces began a major campaign against the Karens last
October.

   Showers and thunderstorms from the remnants of Tropical Storm
Allison spread heavy rain Tuesday over southeastern Texas and
western Louisiana, and thunderstorms were scattered along the Ohio
Valley.
   In the East, Baltimore posted a record-tying high of 98 degrees.
   The highest sustained wind speed associated with the tropical
depression was near 35 mph, with gusts to 45 mph in heavy squalls
along the extreme upper Texas coast. Tides 2 to 3 feet above normal
along the upper Texas coast and the western coast of Louisiana were
expected to slowly decrease during the night.
   Heavier rain amounts for the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
3.95 inches at Lake Charles, La., 2.65 inches at Shreveport, La.,
2.57 inches at Lufkin, Texas, and 1.27 inches at Fort Polk, La.
   A thunderstorm in southwestern Louisiana unleashed a tornado at
Hackberry that destroyed three to four houses and damaged 12 others,
the National Weather Service said. A thunderstorm at Lake Charles
produced high wind which damaged the roof of a hangar and blew the
roofs off two smaller buildings.
   The Shreveport, La., fire department reported that it rescued a
woman whose car slipped into a flooded irrigation ditch. Rescue
personnel said she was in good condition at a local hospital.
   Ahead of a cold front in the upper Midwest, showers and
thunderstorms were scattered from the middle Mississippi Valley to
the central Appalachians, the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes region.
   Thunderstorms packing high winds damaged houses, uprooted trees
and knocked down power lines in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Officials said no
injuries were reported.
   ``At first it started real hard rain. You couldn't see across the
street,'' said Wapakoneta resident Adis Roop. `Then here come the
trees. I ran for the house, I couldn't hardly get through the door.
The suction pulled me back out.''
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from the central
Gulf Coast to southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Bremerton, Wash., to 102 at Phoenix, Ariz. The nation's
low was not supplied by the weather service.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas to the Atlantic Coast
states. Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Montana to Minnesota and Iowa.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted from northern New England to the
Great Lakes, and from western Montana to the northern Pacific Coast
and along the California coast; in the lower 90s across the southern
half of the Atlantic Coast region, and across much of the area from
southern and central interior California to the great Plains region;
and above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   The Air Line Pilots Association asked federal
mediators Tuesday to intervene in talks with strikebound Eastern
Airlines, a request that could complicate the troubled carrier's
plans to reorganize.
   The union made the request of the National Mediation Board even
as it continued negotiations with Eastern in talks ordered by the
bankruptcy judge overseeing the airline, which filed for court
protection from its creditors after its Machinists union struck in
March.
   A Mediation Board spokesman said the request had not been logged
in as of the close of business Tuesday. But the union provided a
copy of the filing, which the union said was delivered to the board
Tuesday afternoon.
   Most pilots have honored Machinists' pickets lines and under
labor law are considered legal sympathy strikers.
   But the request for mediation could trigger a pilots' strike as
well. Nearly 300 ALPA pilots have crossed Machinists picket lines
but ALPA officials contend most of them would refuse to work if
their union struck Eastern.
   Mediation also would add a number of legal and jurisdictional
questions that are likely to further complicate Eastern's legal
odyssey.
   Airline disputes are regulated by the Railway Labor Act, which
gives the mediation board broad powers to try to resolve contract
disputes. Unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless released
from mediation, a situation which occurred prior to the Machinists
strike. Mediation requests generally are granted as a matter of
routine.
   Eastern last week sough bankruptcy court permission to cancel its
contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work rules
it said it needed to reorganize as a smaller carrier.
   Parties engaged in federal mediation, however, are prohibited
from altering terms of their contracts. Mediation Board spokesman
David Bushnell said he believed a mediation request involving a
company in bankruptcy proceedings was unprecedented and could not
say what it would mean for Eastern's bid to abrogate the pilots'
contract.
   ``If in fact mediation is granted, that issue would probably end
up in court,'' said Bushnell.
   Board procedures call for the appointment of a mediator and a
fact-finding process that takes several weeks. The mediator then
would arrange sessions between the parties, which already are
involved in bankruptcy court proceedings and the contract talks
ordered by that court.
   If the mediator declared an impasse, a 30-day cooling off period
would begin after which the union would be free to strike and the
airline free to change provisions of existing contracts.
   Union spokesman Ron Cole said the union decided to seek mediation
after Eastern officials refused to schedule future negotiating
sessions under terms of the Railway Labor Act. Those sessions would
be separate from the bargaining ordered by the bankruptcy judge. A
second meeting under that process was held Tuesday but resulted in
no progress, Cole said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said company officials believed
the bankruptcy court proceedings would supersede the authority of
the Mediation Board.
   He disputed the union's assertion that Eastern had refused to
bargain under the Railway Labor Act, saying Eastern declined to meet
with the union because it has not made a counter-offer to a proposal
Eastern made three weeks ago.
   ``We don't know what they are trying to accomplish with the
mediation,'' he said. ``We believe that the bankruptcy court and the
examiner are better able to handle bankruptcy-related labor
agreements.''
   Also Tuesday, ALPA and Eastern exchanged a new round of charges
and contract charges about whether the carrier will be able to
recruit and train enough new pilots to meet its planned summer
schedule.
   The union said its analysis of new pilot hiring and training
indicated that Eastern would fall at least 236 pilots short, perhaps
as many as 358, of the 837 it would need to fly the August schedule
it has presented to its creditors.
   Eastern dismissed the union's conclusions as the product of
``voodoo arithmetic'' and the overall report as part of attempts by
the pilots and Eastern's other unions to force Texas Air Corp. to
sell the airline.
   ``We have no shortage of employees or other staff to fly the
schedule,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Cermesak. ``The criticism
of insufficient resources will continue as long as they are on the
outside looking in.''
   She said Eastern had told the creditors committee it would fly
221 flights a day in July but had revised the schedule to 226
flights because of progress in training replacements.
   Eastern figures indicate that 276 of its pre-strike pilots have
been crossing picket lines and about 100 replacements have completed
training and begun carrying passengers. More than 500 pilots are in
training.
   Industry analysts have said the airline will be hard-pressed to
recruit and train enough pilots to reach 1,700 by the end of the
year, the number it would need to meet its reorganization goal.

   A 7-year-old girl who was swept away by
fast-flowing water was rescued Tuesday from a storm drain after
clinging to the cracks of the sewer's brick lining for more than 12
hours, authorities said.
   ``She spent the entire night in the city's major sewer system
with all that flood water coming in on her, and hardly had a
scratch,'' said Fire Department spokesman Mike Warnke. ``It's just a
miracle that she could still be alive.''
   Latricia Reese was playing outside her home Monday afternoon when
her young cousin saw her lose her footing in the fast-moving storm
water and slip into a 18-inch culvert.
   She was retrieved around 8 a.m. Tuesday by two construction
workers who removed manhole covers near the spot where she
disappeared and found her clinging onto some cracks in the brick
lining of the sewer, Warnke said.
   ``I just held onto the crack in the cement,'' Latricia said
several hours later from her hospital bed, while watching cartoons
and smiling occasionally at friends and relatives gathered around
her.
   Her mother, Karen Reese, said that after Latricia slipped into
the sewer opening she dropped several levels under the street, twice
plunging more than 6 feet before reaching out and clutching a crack
in the channel wall.
   She said Latricia told her she was bothered throughout her ordeal
by ``mosquitos and ants and bugs.''
   Latricia suffered only abrasions to her knees and elbows and mild
shock. She was in very good condition at Humana Hospital-Southmore,
said spokeswoman Ramona Branch.
   Thunderstorms spawned by Tropical Storm Allison dumped about 10
inches of rain in the Houston area.
   The water was pouring so quickly into the drain where she
disappeared that fire department personnel were unable to reach her,
or even conduct a proper search Monday, Warnke said.
   ``The fire department diving team was called out and they refused
to go in the hole because the water was just so swift that it was
too dangerous,'' he said. ``They thought that at that point, because
the water was moving so fast, that she would have been swept down to
the place where the sewer system empties into the bayou.''
   ``We used a flashlight and saw a little figure about 30 feet
under the street,'' said Timothy Gabrysch, a construction worker who
went into the drain. ``It was pitch dark and she couldn't see
anything.
   ``I have no idea how she stayed there,'' Gabrysch said. ``It's
pretty nasty down there. There's all kinds of debris down there.''
   ``They began yelling her name, and she answered back: `Who are
you?''' Warnke said. ``They told her and she was reluctant to come
outof the hole after being in there all night hanging on through
that swift water.''
   Latricia's reactions were initially confused in the hours right
after her rescue.
   ``When they keep asking her what happened, she gets a little
foggy about that and you don't get really clear answers,'' Ms.
Branch said. ``She also thought she didn't spend the night there.
She thought she went home.''

<UNK>Brazilian Police File Charges Against Super-Investor</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillionaire investor linked to a
financial scandal that shook Brazil's stock markets has been charged
on two counts of financial wrongdoing, police said Tuesday.
   Police questioned Nahas Monday night about his role in the
scandal, but the charges filed were unrelated to the crisis, which
led to the closing of six brokerage houses, police spokesman Mauro
Ament said from Brasilia, the capital.
   Nahas is accused of trying to illegally take dollars out of the
country in 1987 and of violating the Financial System Law in 1983,
Ament said.
   Ament said that in December, 1987, police at Sao Paulo's
International Airport found $20,000 in Nahas' suitcase as he was
about to board a plane for London. By law, Brazilians then were only
allowed to take $1,000.
   In 1983, a construction firm owned by Nahas borrowed the
equivalent of $12 million from the Sogeral Bank, of which he was a
major shareholder. ``This was a violation of the Financial System
Law, which prohibits this kind of transaction,'' Ament said.
   The spokesman said that if convicted on the charges, Nahas faces
an 11-year jail term.
   Federal police also questioned Nahas on his alleged role in the
stock market scandal that broke June 9, but Ament said there was
still insufficeint evidence to bring charges against the investor.
   Nahas bounced $31 million in checks to pay for highly speculative
deals on the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange, according to the
Brazilian Securities Commission.
   On June 12, the government closed all of Brazil's nine stock
markets to avoid panic among investors. Nahas was prohibited from
leaving the country. The market reopened the next day.
   The government has closed six brokerage houses involved in the
scandal, including one owned by Elmo Camoes, former president of the
Central Bank. Camoes resigned shortly before his brokerage was
closed.
   Nahas, a Lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from
mining and farming to real estate and insurance, is a common sight
in Brazilian society pages. In 1984 he hosted Saudi Arabian arms
merchant Adnan Khashoggi on a visit to Brazil.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States
also has linked Nahas with Texas billionaires Nelson Bunker Hunt and
William Herbert Hunt in their ill-fated try to corner the world's
silver bullion market.

   The District of Columbia Council approved
legislation Tuesday to sharply limit outside income for city
officeholders, a move some say is designed to prevent the Rev. Jesse
Jackson from running for mayor.
   The bill, sponsored by council member John Ray and approved on an
11-2 vote, sets a $10,000 limit on income from speeches for the
mayor and council chairman and includes an amendment by council
Chairman David Clarke that limits the mayor or council chairman to
$10,000 income from book royalties.
   Both Ray and Clarke are running for mayor in the 1990 race.
Incumbent Marion Barry has not said whether he will seek re-election.
   Jackson, who earns most of his income from speeches, has not
ruled out running for the $82,500-per-year post.
   ``I am awfully suspicious when two announced candidates put
together legislation to keep someone from running,'' said council
member Frank Smith.
   ``We can ... say that this is a Jesse Jackson bill for sure,''
said council member Nadine Winter. ``We have railroaded a piece of
legislation in 19 days only because the political campaign is
heating up, and it seems to me we have a problem here.''
   Smith and council member Betty Ann Kane voted against the measure.
   Ray denied the bill was meant to keep Jackson off the ballot and
said he began working on it after constituents complained last year
when the council voted itself a pay raise.
   Council member H.R. Crawford said the honoraria limit would be an
unfamiliar concept for most city officials.
   ``From what I hear in the community, most people would pay us
$10,000 only to be quiet,'' Crawford said.

<HEAD>Most of PSA Air Crash Cases Settled Just Before Final Arguments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The families of 38 of the 42 people killed
when a fired airline employee brought down a jetliner in December
1987 settled their cases out of court on Tuesday.
   The settlements came just before final arguments were to be heard
in the liability trial against USAir and others. Damage cases
brought by the families of two passengers, a flight attendant and
the pilot remain.
   Families who did not request confidentiality said settlements
ranged from $200,000 to $3.7 million, attorneys said. The total
payment was less than $37 million but more than $20 million.
   Evidence presented during the trial included allegations of lax
security at both Los Angeles and San Francisco international
airports that allowed fired USAir employee David Burke to board
Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 with a .44-caliber Magnum
pistol.
   ``I think we brought out how bad it was,'' said plaintiff
attorney Ronald Wecht, referring to airport security. ``Among other
things, this was the first public hearing of this airplane crash.
... I think the public had a right and a need to know about this
kind of disaster.''
   A telephone call seeking comment from lead defense counsel George
Manfredi was not immediately returned.
   Forty-three people, including Burke, died in the Dec. 7, 1987,
crash. Federal investigators concluded that midway through the
flight, Burke shot his supervisor, then entered the cockpit and shot
the crew.
   Minutes later, the BAe-146 four-engine plane slammed into a
hillside north of San Luis Obispo in an explosive crash. There were
no survivors.
   Marshall Foreman, who represented the families of crew members
killed in the crash, said the most damaging testimony in the trial
came from former USAir employee Joe Drabik, who loaned Burke the gun
used in the shootings and was a USAir supervisor in San Francisco at
the time.
   Drabik testified that in November he loaned the gun and 12 rounds
of ammunition to Burke, a longtime friend, at Burke's request. Burke
had already been fired by USAir for allegedly stealing $69 from a
petty cash box.
   Drabik said that on the day he loaned Burke the gun at the
airport he helped him get it through security by walking through an
employee bypass at the metal detector station while Burke walked
through the detectors.
   Although Drabik insisted that he did not carry the gun through
for Burke, he could not explain how Burke could pass through the
detectors and not set them off.
   ``Not one juror we talked to later said they believed that,''
said Foreman. ``It was the most damaging testimony for USAir. An
employee had knowingly violated security.''
   Other testimony came from experts on how Burke managed to sneak a
gun aboard Flight 1771 at Los Angeles International. Both sides
agreed that Burke used an unreturned employee identification badge
to move unchallenged through the airport, but his route to the plane
with the gun was disputed.
   Plaintiffs contended Burke could have simply flashed his
identification badge at security guards and used a bypass to avoid
metal detectors.
   Since the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration has
tightened requirements for airline employees passing through
security areas and regulation of identification badge issues.
   The settlements came before closing arguments or jury
deliberations began in the Los Angeles Superior Court case overseen
by Judge Jack T. Ryburn.
   Defendants included Pacific Southwest Airlines, its parent
company USAir, the city Department of Airports and Ogden Allied
Security, the private firm that handles metal detection and
passenger screening stations at Los Angeles International Airport.
   By agreement, the Airports Department was dismissed as a
defendant by all plaintiffs.
   Wecht, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, suggested that the
remaining cases might eventually be settled out of court as well.
   ``It wasn't feasible for them to settle at this time,'' said
Foreman, who refused to elaborate.

   National guardsmen opened fire on
villagers protesting a mining operation, fatally wounding a young
man, officials reported Tuesday.
   A National Republican Guard spokesmen said six shots were fired
after a guardsman was injured Monday by villagers throwing stones.
   Carlos Simoes, 20, was shot in the head and taken to a hospital
in Oporto, 45 miles away, where he died Tuesday.
   More than 200 residents of this northern village fought with
about 80 armed guardsmen during the protest.
   Portugal's National Republican Guard is a paramilitary police
force, similar to Spain's Civil Guard, that operates mainly in rural
areas.
   Villagers say a nearby mine, where porcelain clay is extracted,
pollutes the air and water and uses machinery that violates noise
restrictions.
   The guard spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping with
regulation, said the Interior Ministry had ordered an investigation
of the use of firearms in the confrontation.
   At least 12 other villagers and a guardsman were treated at
hospitals for injuries siffered in the fighting. Protesters fled
into nearby cafes and houses.
   A villager reached by telephone from Lisbon on Tuesday said
Barqueiros was calm and ``we're in mourning.'' Witnesses said the
mine was operating.
   In a statement issued Monday, the Mibal mining company said it
would not be ``intimidated by ... threats in clear disrespect of the
law and democracy.''
   Residents of Barqueiros boycotted European Parliament elections
this month as part of their protest.

<HEAD>Head of Church Council Quits, His ``Dream'' For It Rebuffed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the National Council of Churches said
Tuesday he's quitting because ``ecumenical dreams'' for the council
as a more unifying movement have been blocked.
   The Rev. Arie R. Brouwer said that in recent struggles over
council objectives, ``differences in dreams led to the sharpness of
the conflict,'' with him favoring fuller integration of the
council's operational units.
   ``I can do no more in this position to fulfill'' that goal, he
told a conference.
   Brouwer, 53, said he would step down Friday as the council's
general secretary, a post he has held for four and a half years, the
last two embroiled in turmoil over future council directions.
   The council, the country's largest ecumenical organization,
includes most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations
totaling more than 40 million members.
   Brouwer, a tall, quiet-spoken Midwesterner from Iowa and a
clergyman in the Reformed Church in America, emphasized he was not
leaving the council office ``in a spirit of anger or bitterness.''
   The conflict over goals boiled to a near breaking point at a May
meeting in Lexington, Ky., of the council's governing board, which
split evenly _ 57 votes to 57 _ over a move to oust Brouwer.
   He said his resignation ``is a direct result of events
precipitated'' at that meeting, which initiated steps to consolidate
11 council units into four, each run by church representatives
largely independent of other units.
   Brouwer said this essentially perpetuated the past loosely linked
units, mostly setting their own policies.
   He had clashed sharply with Church World Service, the council's
relief arm and largest operational unit, in trying to bring it into
joint administration, efforts that CWS strongly resisted.
   At the Lexington meeting, Brouwer sharply delineated the
conflict, denouncing a tide of ``rumors, innuendo and false
charges'' against him. Critics had called Brouwer harsh and
autocratic.
   He said the problem was that he dared speak the truth. ``The
powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and they are outraged.
They will not have it.''
   Brouwer said he spoke out strongly about the matter then because
``I wanted to set it openly before the entire community,'' knowing
that doing so involved ``personal vulnerability and professional
risk.''
   The tie vote over his continuing in his post showed that the
governing board could not resolve the issues, he said, and in
reflecting about the impasse, he concluded he should resign.
   ``Under those circumstances, I could not carry further the work
which is essential to my vocational fulfillment,'' he said in a
written statement.
   ``To outside observers, this must surely seem to be a time of
great brokenness for the council. It is, but it is also a time of
healing and binding. The experiences of the past few weeks have in
some ways brought us closer together.''
   Brouwer was chief executive of the Reformed Church in America
before he took the council post in 1985 at a time when a special
panel had presented plans for making the council a closer-knit
``communion of communions.''
   Acknowleging that he had been rebuffed in trying to implement
that larger dream, he added, ``That does not, however, mean that I
am giving up on those dreams or on the council.''
   A statement by other council officers said, ``We profoundly
regret the developments in our life together that now deprive our
community of Arie's leadership.''
   The Rev. Patricia McClurg, a Presbyterian and the council's
titular president, said there has been a ``great deal of hurt'' in
the conflict, and the council wanted to move forward toward greater
unity, but she added:
   ``This was not the right time. We didn't learn to do it quickly
enough. We've had some rough sledding. But we haven't given up.''
   The Rev. James Hamilton, a United Methodist and the council's
Washinton, D.C. public-policy representative, was named as the
council's acting general secretary until Brouwer's successor is
chosen.

   Environmentalists on Tuesday rejected a
compromise plan that would have preserved the best Northwest forest
land for the rare Northern spotted owl while freeing enough timber
to keep mills operating.
   The environmental groups, however, said they were willing to
continue negotiating toward a solution that would overcome a bitter
court battle, which has tied up billions of board feet of timber on
federal lands.
   ``We are talking about the extinction of a species and shouldn't
act precipitously,'' said Andy Kerr, conservation director for the
Oregon Natural Resources Council. ``Conservationists, like misers,
may be hell to live with, but we make great ancestors.''
   Timber industry officials had said they were willing to accept
the compromise offered Saturday by members of the Oregon
congressional delegation and Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   The proposal called for a short-term increase in the number of
trees that could be cut on federal land in Oregon and Washington
while protecting some of the older forests where the rare Northern
spotted owl nests.
   A statement issued by the environmental groups said they could
not accept the timber harvest figures in the compromise without more
information.
   ``The proposal was a bittersweet pill,'' Robert L. Spence,
chairman of the Northwest Forest Resources Council, said at a news
conference in Seattle. ``The simple truth is that less timber means
fewer jobs.''
   In Washington, D.C., Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., reacted angrily to
the rejection, while Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., expressed hopes for an
eventual resolution.
   ``All bets are off,'' said Smith, who has proposed legislation to
allow unrestricted logging for five years while the status of the
owl is studied more.
   ``No doors are closed,'' said AuCoin spokeswoman Rachael Gorlin.
``We're in touch with everyone.''
   The compromise was offered at the so-called spotted owl summit
meeting in Salem among representatives of the timber industry,
environmentalists, all seven members of Oregon's congressional
delegation and Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.

<TEXT>
   Tehran Radio said Tuesday that 205 of the
270 deputies in Iran's Parliament have asked Ahmad Khomeini, son of
the late revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to run
for Parliament.
   Political foes said it was intended to avert an open power
struggle between radicals led by Ahmad Khomeini and pragmatists led
by Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the only announced
candidate in the July 28 presidential election.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the Tehran
Times daily as saying the deputies suggested that Ahmad Khomeini
become speaker if he wins an election in Rafsanjani's Tehran
constituency.
   Rafsanjani, who polled 1.3 million votes in last year's
parliamentary election, will have to give up his seat in the Majlis,
or parliament, to run for president. No date has been set for the
by-election.
   ``We call upon your excellency to be in the Majlis ... to become
a cause of strength, encouragement and guidance for this important
pillar of legislation in the arena of the country's decisions,'' the
radio quoted the deputies as saying in a letter to Ahmad Khomeini.
   The Iranian news media were monitored in Nicosia.
   The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors,
opposition group said the deputies' offer was aimed at leaving
Rafsajani a clear run.
   Speculation has grown that the politically ambitious Ahmad
Khomeini, 43, would declare himself a candidate for president to run
against Rafsanjani.
   Many analysts said that would lead to an open fight for power
between the pragmatists and their radical rivals.
   The Mujahedeen said in a statement telexed from their Baghdad
headquarters to The Associated Press in Nicosia: ``Ahmad has told
his aides that if Rafsanjani becomes president, that would lead to
splits within the regime and its disintegration.''
   It said the deputies sent the letter to Ahmad on Sunday and that
Rafsanjani was a signatory.
   ``The letter ... reflects the deputies' profound fears that any
factional alignment in the presidential elections would lead to the
disintegration of the whole regime'' following Ayatollah Khomeini's
death June 3, the Mujahedeen said.
   Analysts believe that if Rafsanjani is elected president, he will
take over the day-to-day running of Iran. Once entrenched, his
pragmatic faction is expected to maneuver to loosen the government's
grip on the economy and to mend relations with the West.
   Such policies are anathema to the radicals. The Mujahedeen say
the radicals are engineering to promote Ahmad Khomeini in the
hierarchy to curb the power of their rival camp.
   The younger Khomeini, a low-ranking clergyman, has held no
official position, but he was a close aide to his father and
controlled access to him.

with an explosion several times the force of the Hiroshima atomic
bomb.
   The blast registered 4.6 on the Richter scale of ground motion at
the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
according to spokesman John Minsch.
   Monitors atop highrise hotels in Las Vegas, 100 miles from ground
zero, registered the blast. But the readings were not as distinct as
with some previous tests.
   The test, code-named Amarillo, was the second major U.S. nuclear
weapons test in six days. Energy Department officials deemed the
latest shot a success.
   The device was detonated 2,100 feet beneath the surface of Pahute
Mesa on the sprawling desert test range and had an explosive force
of up to 150,000 tons of TNT. The blast that destroyed Hiroshima had
an explosive force of 13,000 tons of TNT.
   ``The seismograph needle is swinging wildly from side to side,''
Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said as he monitored the blast
in a control center 30 miles from ground zero.
   The test was originally scheduled for Saturday, then delayed
several times because of unfavorable wind conditions. It was
rescheduled for Sunday, then delayed again for the same reason.
   Tests are not conducted if winds are blowing toward a populated
area such as Las Vegas in the event that nuclear radiation escapes
the underground cavity where the nuclear device is detonated.
   Boyer said monitoring equipment surrounding ground zero indicated
there was no leak of radiation.

   The communist New People's Army
acknowledged on Tuesday that its rebel fighters killed 39 villagers
at a church over the weekend, but said anti-communist vigilantes
among the victims fired first.
   Officials reported at least eight people wounded in the encounter
Sunday at the United Church of Christ chapel in Rano, 640 miles
southeast of Manila, and said two of those killed, a Protestant lay
leader and his brother, were beheaded.
   The NPA has been fighting for 20 years to establish a communist
state in the Philippines.
   A church official in Manila said all 39 people killed were
members of the congregation.
   A survivor said two rebels also were killed, but military
officials said the guerrillas apparently carried away their dead.
   An NPA statement, distributed to reporters in Davao City,
expressed regret over the deaths of women and children. It said
rebels gave some wounded first aid.
   The statement said 24 guerrillas entered Rano ``to hold a
dialogue with the residents,'' many of whom were also members of an
anti-Marxist vigilante group.
   It said the rebels asked the vigilante commander to leave the
chapel ``and offered a peace dialogue.''
   ``But they answered back with hostility and attacked the team,''
the statement said. ``What occurred at Rano was more of self-defense
than attack. The NPA ... had no alternative but to fight back.''
   Lt. Col. Jose Maneja, deputy commander of Davao del Sur province,
said on Monday, that the bloodshed came after about 100 guerrillas
entered the village looking for the vigilantes' leader.

<HEAD>Ruling Leaves Just One `Bill Haley's Comets'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate's ruling Tuesday
cleared the way for just one of Bill Haley's Comets to rock around
the clock.
   U.S. Magistrate John Jarvey approved a preliminary injunction
request by John ``BamBam'' Lane Barrowclough of Crum Lynne, Pa., a
drummer who joined Haley's band in 1965, to stop a New Jersey man
from performing under the name Bill Haley's Comets or any similar
name.
   Haley, one of rock 'n' roll's pioneers known for such hits as
``Rock Around the Clock'' and ``See Ya Later Alligator,'' died in
February 1981, nearly 30 years after forming the band Bill Haley &amp;
The Comets.
   Barrowclough, one of five musicians who comprise the group Bill
Haley's Comets, contended that a group headed by Joseph Grazino of
Pemberton, N.J., was causing confusion by using Haley's name and was
costing Barrowclough's band jobs.
   The complaint was filed after a June 3 performance in Mason City
by Grazino's band, which also bills itself as Bill Haley's Comets.
   Barrowclough and two partners _ band member Al Rappa and the
Jolly Joyce Agency booking agency _ have held trademark rights to
the names Haley's Comets and Bill Haley's Comets since Oct. 21,
1987. The group claimed trademark infringement, unfair competition
and false designation under the federal trademark act.
   Grazino, who does business as Joey Rand and was referred to as
Rand throughout the injunction hearing, did not attend the session
nor was he represented by anyone. There is no telephone listing for
Grazino in Pemberton, N.J., and efforts to reach him were
unsuccessful.
   Barrowclough said he was happy with the ruling and hopes it will
clear up confusion among booking agents and fans.
   ``The market for Bill Haley's Comets is worldwide,'' he said.
``When people come to see Bill Haley's Comets, they don't know there
are, or used to be, two Bill Haley's Comets.''
   Grazino received permission from Jolly Joyce to use the Haley
name for his performances from Dec. 8, 1981, to Dec. 8, 1984.
Barrowclough said that was during a time when he and the agency were
fighting each other on the trademark issue and that Joyce had no
authority to grant permission. The differences have been reconciled
and Joyce no longer books acts for Grazino.
   ``Rand has never worked with Bill Haley, although he states he
has. He never appeared with Bill Haley ... and to our knowledge he
has never even met Bill Haley,'' said Barrowclough.
   Barrowclough and his partnership have asked for triple damages,
court costs and any profits earned by Grazino's band since Dec. 8,
1984, but a hearing on those issues has not been scheduled. The
injunction will be in effect until the hearing.

<HEAD>$250 Checks Go to Would-Be Van Winners in Kraft Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft has begun sending out $250 checks as
consolation prizes for would-be winners of a $17,000 van offered in
the company's botched ``Ready to Roll'' contest, officials said
Tuesday.
   The food company based in this northwest Chicago suburb had
planned to give away only one van in the game. But a printing error
in newspaper inserts distributed June 11 created hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of winning combinations with matching pieces in packages
of Kraft Singles cheese.
   The firm nullified the contest June 12, but offered the $250 to
those holding game pieces that indicated they had won the van.
   ``We hope that the actions we're taking will show consumers how
much we appreciate their understanding and patience during this
situation,'' said Kathy Knuth, a spokeswoman for Kraft USA.
   The checks from the food company are accompanied by letters
saying that the company is ``sorry for any confusion or
disappointment the flawed game may have caused.''
   The grand prize in the game, offered only in Chicago and Houston
areas, was a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE worth $17,000.
   Officials of Kraft USA _ a division of Kraft General Foods, which
is part of Philip Morris Cos. Inc. of New York City _ have so far
not specified how many people mailed in matching game pieces for the
van and other prizes offered.
   ``That information isn't available right now,'' Ms. Knuth said
Tuesday.
   After the error was discovered and the game canceled, Kraft
officials announced a modified contest.
   Claimants were required to have mailed their pieces by midnight,
June 16, to qualify for cash and a July 14 drawing for four vans and
other prizes. The company also announced plans to send $250 checks
to van claimants.
   Jerry O'Hearn, 48, of suburban Brookfield, got his check in the
mail Monday _ just 10 days after he sent in his game pieces.
   ``Those Kraft people just made a big flub out of the whole
deal,'' said O'Hearn.
   But he said he does not intend to participate in class-action
lawsuits against the company. At least two such lawsuits were filed
earlier this month, with plaintiffs seeking more than the $250 the
company offered.
   ``I can see how a mistake could happen,'' said O'Hearn. ``It's
pretty fair what they've done.''
   In addition to the van, Kraft had originally planned to award 100
bicycles, 500 skateboards and 8,000 packages of cheese.
   Ms. Knuth said that payments have also started going to would-be
winners of those prizes _ $50 to bicycle winners, $25 to skateboard
winners and $5 to cheese winners. She said she was unsure whether
all checks had been mailed.
   Only one winner is allowed per household, under company rules.

<HEAD>Hurt Trial Ends with Former Wife Saying He Did Not Want to Marry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Mary Beth Hurt testified Tuesday that she
urged her then-husband, actor William Hurt, to marry his pregnant
lover but he rejected the idea, saying he would never wed again.
   ``I'm finished with marriage,'' Ms. Hurt said the actor told her
when they discussed his relationship with former ballerina Sandra
Jennings in a September 1982 meeting. She said Hurt had asked for
the meeting because he wanted to talk about finalizing their divorce.
   Ms. Hurt said that, except for a brief reconciliation in 1978,
she and Hurt had been separated since 1975 and she asked him why he
wanted to complete the divorce at that time. She said he replied,
``Because Sandy's having a baby.''
   ``Do you intend to marry her?'' Ms. Hurt said she asked him.
   ``No,'' she said Hurt responded.
   ``I said, `Marry her, Bill.'''
   ``He said, `No. I'm finished with marriage.'''
   Ms. Hurt testified on the final day of a Manhattan state Supreme
Court trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law marriage
with Ms. Jennings, 32, his former live-in lover and mother of his
6-year-old son Alexander.
   Ms. Hurt's testimony appeared to support Hurt's contention that
he never considered Ms. Jennings his wife and never intended to
marry her.
   Later in the day, movie producer Tim Zinnemann testified that
Hurt told actress Mary Kay Place at a baby shower for Ms. Jennings
in Beaufort, S.C., to ``Mind your own business!'' when she asked
whether Hurt planned to marry his lover.
   Zinnemann, who married actress Meg Tilly in Beaufort during the
filming of ``The Big Chill,'' said the possibility of a double
wedding with Hurt and Ms. Jennings was discussed.
   Zinnemann said that after their wedding Ms. Tilly threw her
bouquet over her shoulder toward Ms. Jennings, who almost caught it
but dropped it.
   The producer said he invited Ms. Jennings and Hurt to be
witnesses at his wedding, but Hurt did not show because ``he
purportedly overslept.''
   Ms. Jennings, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, is
suing Hurt for divorce, basing her claim on four weeks they lived
together in Beaufort while Hurt was filming ``The Big Chill.''
   Ms. Jennings says the common-law marriage began under South
Carolina law Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned he was divorced. They
left South Carolina Jan. 10, 1983.
   If state Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann finds there
was a marriage, she could give Ms. Jennings a piece of Hurt's income
for the past 6{ years. Ms. Jennings' lawyer, Richard Golub, says
Hurt is worth about $10 million.
   Hurt's former housekeeper-personal assistant, Dianna Schiebel,
returned to court Tuesday with a lawyer. The judge had advised her
to do so after she admitted taking Hurt's personal files and giving
them to Ms. Jennings' lawyer.
   Ms. Schiebel, who testified that Hurt told her to shred his
financial records after learning Ms. Jennings was suing him, said
she gave the files to Golub in March, after Hurt married Heidi
Henderson, daughter of bandleader Skitch Henderson.
   Ms. Schiebel, who also claimed that she developed emotional
problems after going to work for Hurt, said she was under
psychiatric treatment as a result.
   ``Are you claiming Mr. Hurt caused these (ailments)?'' asked Hurt
lawyer Frances Jacobs.
   ``Yes, I am,'' Ms. Schiebel replied.
   Ms. Silbermann said she will accept briefs with closing arguments
from the lawyers in the near future and render a decision soon after
that.

   A U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who defected to
the Soviet Union in 1986 complaining of FBI harassment actually was
a long-time Soviet spy, a newspaper said Tuesday in disclosing his
death at the age of 32.
   The disclosure that Glenn Michael Souther had been ``a staff
member of the KGB'' was a rare admission of Soviet spying.
   The military newspaper Red Star published an obituary signed by
the KGB collegium and his ``work comrades'' of the man it called
Mikhail Yevgenievich Orlov. It said he died suddenly June 22, but
did not give a cause of death.
   A picture accompanying the obituary showed a clean-cut Souther
wearing a suit and tie.
   It was not clear whether he was a Soviet mole working under cover
for years in the United States, or whether he began working for the
KGB _ the Soviet secret police and intelligence unit _ only after
his defection.
   ``I think it's probably too early to tell,'' FBI spokesman Mike
Kortan said in Washington.
   He said Souther was born in Hammond, Ind., went to high school in
Cumberland, Maine. The FBI believes he took the name Orlov when he
defected, Kortan said.
   ``There's some attempt to imply that he was really a Soviet-born
citizen and became a mole, but that was never really stated and I
don't believe it's true,'' said Ronald Kessler, a Maryland author
who is writing a book on Souther. ``He was an American mole.''
   Kessler spoke in a telephone interview from his home in Potomac,
Md.
   The FBI says Souther was a Navy veteran who disappeared in May
1986 after graduating from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.,
with a major in Russian. He served in the Navy in the 1970s and
worked as a civilian intelligence specialist in the Navy's 2nd Fleet
headquarters in Norfolk. He apparently was being investigated for
espionage at the time.
   Old Dominion professors said in Virginia that Souther was an
outgoing, well-liked student who started out poorly in his Russian
major.
   Leonid I. Mihalap, a Soviet-born professor who taught Souther
Russian, said he may have become disillusioned with the Soviet Union
and committed suicide.
   Barbara Fahey, a professor's wife who knew Souther when he was a
student, said: ``I think they decided that this was a bad apple.
Probably somebody just said, `Hey, let's get rid of him.'''
   Kortan said Souther's wife did not defect with him.
   ``All that's come out is the fact that his wife has said she
suspected him several years before he left,'' Kortan said, adding he
did not know the status of their marriage.
   Soviet media reported in July 1988 that Souther had been granted
asylum in the Soviet Union after he claimed FBI agents persecuted
him.
   The obitary said he was a ``Soviet intelligence agent'' who had
worked a long time to ``remove the threat of nuclear war hanging
over humanity,'' and had ``performed special assignments and made a
large contribution to ensuring Soviet state security.''
   The newspaper did not say exactly what he did for the KGB, or how
long he had spied for the Soviets.
   Shortly after his defection was disclosed, Souther appeared on
Soviet TV to describe his American work with secret reconnaissance
photographs taken by satellites to help plan the U.S. bombing raid
on Libya in April 1986.
   The attack was to retaliate for what Washington claimed was
Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West German disco in which a
U.S. serviceman was killed and 50 others wounded.
   In his TV appearance, Souther said nothing about spying for the
Soviets.
   During the broadcast, Souther indicated he had not settled in to
Soviet life and wasn't satisfied with what he was doing.
   Although he said he had a comfortable Moscow apartment, Souther
added, ``There's a lot of work here, but I haven't found my niche
exactly. I don't feel that I'm being the most productive for what I
have to offer.''
   Red Star said he ``made a great contribution to maintaining the
Soviet Union's security.''

<HEAD>Senate Staff Report Challenges Shoreham Closure; Seabrook Sirens
OK'ed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee staff analysis concluded
Tuesday that running the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant
on Long Island would be cheaper that shutting it down, contrary to
an analysis by state regulators.
   After hearing some of the report's conclusions, Chairman Peter
Bradford of the New York Public Service Commission characterized the
study, which he had not seen, as ``baloney.''
   The analysis was released as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board decided that it was acceptable to
use pole-mounted sirens on trucks to notify nearby Massachusetts
residents of an emergency at the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power
plant, the other completed but not operating reactor in the
Northeast.
   Though some of the truck sites would slightly exceed federal
guidelines of that it should not take more than 15 minutes to set
off warnings, the board said the plan by the Seabrook operators was
adequate considering ``the fact that concerned political
jurisdictions can reduce alerting and notification times by making
sites available for sirens permanently mounted on poles.''
   The state of Massachusetts and its towns in the evacuation zones
have refused to cooperate in emergency planning, and Massachusetts
Deputy Attorney General Stephen Jonas said the state would appeal
the decision to an appeal board.
   The Senate report, an analysis of a New York commission study
performed last year of the plant owned by Long Island Lighting Co.
or LILCO, was prepared by an economist with the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources, which is chaired by Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La.
   ``His study concludes that the PSC report is a biased and unfair
comparison of Shoreham In-Service and the Settlement,'' Johnston
said in a letter to Bradford. ``The study shows that Shoreham
operation would save three-quarters of a billion dollars in real
economic costs over the first 15 years of its life.''
   The settlement refers to the pending deal, to be voted on by
LILCO shareholders Wednesday, to turn the $5.5 billion plant over to
the state for $1 and assurance of a decade's worth of rate increases
of about 5 percent a year. Though fully licensed, the plant has
never entered commercial operation. Local and state authorities
contend nearby residents could not be evacuated in an emergency.
   Bradford said Johnston assigned staff ``to go and find every
fault that they could with the PSC-LILCO study.''
   The Senate staff analysis concludes that LILCO's electric rates
with Shoreham in service would average about 15.22 cents per
kilowatt-hour, 0.29 cents cheaper than under the shutdown.
   The state study estimated the average rate if Shoreham operates
sat 14.96 cents or 0.52 cents more expensive than closing it down.
   The report criticized the PSC analysis for placing too much
emphasis on electric rates in the first 11 years of Shoreham
operation while ``utility investments are typically analyzed over
planning horizons of 20-30 years.''
   ``That's flat wrong,'' Bradford countered. ``The PSC's study runs
out to the year 2003, I believe, but a lot of the further
calculations run out over the life of Shoreham.''
   The committee staff study also said, among other things, that the
state had overestimated the savings to the company of being able to
carry more debt with Shoreham retired, had failed to assign enough
cost to shrunken generating reserves without Shoreham and had
assumed the implausibly low price for oil, LILCO's major fuel, in
the year 2000 of $15 per barrel vs. $20 to $25 a barrel forecasts by
private consulting firms.

<HEAD>Coroner Says Former Raiders Star Overdosed on Darvon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from coroner and parents, background.
A version is also moving sports wires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former pro football star John Matuszak died of
an accidental overdose of a mild narcotic painkiller, the coroner
said Tuesday in a report that also found non-lethal traces of
cocaine in his system.
   Also contributing to the death of the former Oakland Raider
defensive lineman were an enlarged heart and pneumonia, Los Angeles
County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said.
   ``The manner of death is listed as an accident,'' Dambacher said.
   Matuszak's parents immediately acknowledged his use of prescribed
and illegal drugs for his chronic pain.
   ``At the proper time, we will have things to say about substance
abuse and the scoundrels in the medical profession who recklessly
dispense prescription drugs and the parasites of society who
distribute illicit drugs from back alleys to fashionable
condominiums,'' his parents, Marv and Audrey Matuszak, said in a
statement released within minutes of the coroner's report.
   Matuszak, who was 38 when he died June 17 in a Burbank hospital,
had been given a prescription for Darvocet early that morning,
Dambacher said.
   Darvocet is a combination of two drugs: propoxyphene, a mild
narcotic painkiller found in Darvon, and acetaminophen, the
painkiller found in Tylenol, Anacin-3, Panadol and Tempra.
   High doses of propoxyphene ``taken for prolonged periods may lead
to physical dependence on the drug. However, it is less addictive
than other similar drugs, and most people are able to stop treatment
without difficulty,'' according to the American Medical
Association's ``Guide to Prescription And Over-The-Counter Drugs.''
   The propoxyphene level found in Matuszak's blood was 3.4
micrograms per milliliter, Dambacher said.
   ``Anything could be fatal over 1.0 (micrograms), but that depends
if you've perhaps been using it, you can build up a tolerance,''
Dambacher said. ``With his size (6-foot-8, 280 pounds) and his prior
use of it, we don't know how much it takes.
   Dambacher said he did not know how much of the painkiller
Matuszak took before his death.
   Tests also showed traces of a byproduct of cocaine, but that was
not considered to have contributed to Matuszak's death, Dambacher
said.
   Side effects of Darvocet _ including dizziness, drowsiness and
nausea _ are more common in active people, and often can be relieved
by lying down and resting. ``Serious adverse effects are rare except
in overdose,'' the AMA said.
   Matuszak's parents alluded to their son's battle against chronic
pain ``and his resulting use of drugs, both prescription and
otherwise.''
   ``For now, however, we do not wish the dark side of these
realities to detract from the celebration of the good and great
deeds of this kind and wonderful man _ our son.''
   The Matuszaks' statement was released by a publicist. They were
in California for a memorial service and could not immediately be
reached for additional comment.
   Matuszak played for the Raiders from 1976-81 and was on two Super
Bowl championship teams. He was on the injured reserve list when the
club moved to Los Angeles in 1982.
   Matuszak retired that year to pursue an acting career fulltime.

<HEAD>Doctors Conducting Trial Of Chinese AIDS Drug</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced
Tuesday it is investigating doctors in several U.S. cities who are
testing an AIDS drug from China without federal approval.
   Nine doctors in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City have
treated 42 patients with Compound Q, imported from China with the
help of couriers who in some cases bribed Chinese government
officials, doctors said Monday. Three patients showed adverse
reactions and one died Saturday.
   Compound Q is the name AIDS researchers have given to
trichosanthin, a protein from the root of a cucumberlike plant that
Chinese doctors have used to induce abortions and to treat cancer
since the third century.
   Dr. Paul Rothman, one of the doctors in the underground testing,
said that observations of 15 patients in Los Angeles indicated the
drug ``appears to be the most effective AIDS medication available or
on the horizon.''
   ``We would have liked to have done this study formally, and with
the approval of the FDA,'' he said. ``But one person dies from AIDS
every 30 minutes. We felt that as long as we proceeded on a rigorous
scientific basis, we would be on very strong ground.''
   The FDA, under its so-called compassionate use decision, allows
individuals to import ``personal use'' quantities of experimental
drugs. The supplies must be no more than enough for one individual
use for three months. Large-scale importation of unapproved products
for commercial use is prohibited. Violating FDA policy on
distributing unapproved drugs could result in seizure of the
material; cease and desist orders; or, in rare cases, mostly
involving for-profit schemes, criminal penalties.
   The agency said drug testing must be done under its scrutiny.
   ``We will be investigating this matter, to see just what has
occurred,'' said FDA spokesman Brad Stone in Washington.
   The FDA has approved only one drug, AZT, to treat AIDS, and side
effects keep many patients from taking it.
   The FDA in April approved testing on AIDS patients of GLQ223, a
highly purified form of trichosanthin developed at the University of
California at San Francisco and Genelabs of Redwood City, Calif.
   At the time, Genelabs warned that AIDS patients should not turn
to China to get the active ingredient because it might have toxic
side effects.
   Some AIDS activists charged that the university and Genelabs were
taking that position to protect an agreement giving their financial
backer, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz Ltd., exclusive
rights to market GLQ223.
   At least one doctor not involved in the underground testing said
the extreme side effects of Compound Q could have contributed to the
death Saturday of an AIDS patient at San Francisco's Mount Zion
Hospital.
   That was denied by Martin Delaney, co-director of Project Inform,
a San Francisco AIDS education group that organized the network of
doctors in the underground testing.
   ``But I want to stress that this is not herbal tea,'' said
Delaney. ``This is radical chemotherapy. Some of the patients have
had a very rough ride.''
   San Francisco immunologist, Dr. Alan Levin, who helped set up the
study of Compound Q, said the program is at least six months ahead
of mainline research on the drug's efficacy and contended he could
have dosage recommendations within three months.
   ``From our tests, we'll have better scientific data in 10 percent
of time and 1 percent of the cost it is taking regular science to do
the job,'' said Levin. He and his wife, Dr. Vera Byers, designed the
trial.
   ``Our scientific (procedures) are very good and rigorous,'' said
Levin. ``I resent people calling us underground, illegal or guerilla
groups. We're not amateurs. We're first-class doctors.''
   Levin said lawyers for doctors involved in the program had
informed FDA officials earlier this spring of the treatment trial.

<HEAD>House Rejects Special Status for Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday rejected a five-year
extension of most-favored-nation trading status for Hungary, with
some members arguing the issue should be left to the president's
discretion.
   President Bush already has announced he intends to extend the
trade preference for another year.
   The House vote was 242-172 for the legislation, less than the
two-thirds necessary to pass a bill under suspension of the rules, a
procedure generally reserved for non-controversial bills.
   During debate, Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the House
Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said: ``The people of Hungary
have demonstrated since World War II that they seek and yearn for
freedom. They're close now. It is time for us to take them off of
probation and extend a helping hand.''
   Earlier, at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Curtis W.
Kamman, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs,
said Hungary had made progress in human rights, including free
travel and emigration.
   Hungary, a communist nation in the Warsaw Pact, will clearly meet
the criteria for a new extension of its most-favored-nation status,
which presidents have renewed annually over the past decade, he said.
   In light of that, there is no need for Congress to direct a
five-year extension, he said.
   Countries in most-favored-nation status are guaranteed the lowest
tariffs applicable to their products _ in other words, they will be
treated like ``the most favored nation.''
   Speaking against the measure on the House floor, Rep. Ben Gilman,
R-N.Y., said the trade benefits should be left to the president to
determine, and pointed to the recent Chinese crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement as an example of how quickly situations can
change.
   Gilman also hinted that President Bush might want to make the
announcement himself during a trip to Budapest in about two weeks.
He asked colleagues not to ``pre-empt the president from taking the
kinds of steps he would be inclined to do later on this year.''
   Bush on May 31 announced his intention to extend Hungary's trade
benefit for another year.
   The president also has generally held out the hope of increased
economic aid to East Bloc countries that expand freedoms, and has
promised a longer-term extension of most-favored-nation trading
status to Hungary if it passes a liberalized emigration law.
   Current law bars most-favored-nation status, with its
preferential customs duty rates, to communist countries with
restrictive emigration policies. Since the ban was imposed in 1974,
three nations have been granted waivers: Hungary, Romania and China.

   Frank Trapani, a longtime jazz trumpeter with
the Dukes of Dixieland, has died of a blood clot to the lungs. He
was 52.
   Trapani died Monday at a hospital. He will be given a traditional
jazz funeral on Thursday.
   ``Frank was one of the greatest trumpeters in town,'' said John
Shoup, manager of the Dukes of Dixieland. ``He was a true New
Orleans player. But in the same breath he could play all styles of
music.''
   Trapani played with the orchestras of Charlie Barnett, Les Elgard
and Billy May, as well as with artists such as Pearl Bailey, Tony
Bennett, Lou Rawls and Quincy Jones.
   He was lead trumpeter with the Dick Stabile Orchestra in New
Orleans for 12 years until 1974, when he joined the Dukes of
Dixieland.
   For the past 12 years he was the Dukes' front man, the musician
who introduced each number to the audience.
   Survivors include his wife, four children and several
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Committee Would Bar Referrals To Some Affiliated Labs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee approved
legislation Tuesday that would bar doctors from referring patients
to testing labs they own, but do not supervise.
   The anti-referral package, pushed by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,
is part of an overall Medicare bill the committee is expected to
approve on Wednesday.
   Even though the section on referrals technically could be changed
before the overall bill wins final committee approval, committee
staffers said it and several less controversial matters are
considered final for all practical purposes.
   The panel left the most controversial part of the Medicare bill
until Wednesday, the second of two days of closed hearings: whether
to clamp a limit on the overall amount Medicare will pay for doctor
bills and whether to adopt a new fee schedule for Medicare-covered
services.
   The health subcommittee headed by Stark proposed setting targets
under which Medicare doctor bill spending could not grow more than
somewhere between 10 percent and 12 percent next year.
   If actual 1990 billings exceeded that amount, fees would be held
down to compensate.
   The anti-referral provisions are aimed at removing the financial
incentive for doctors to enhance their income by referring patients
to labs in which their sole interest is financial rather than
professional.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs, bgng ``Watkins announcement,'' to include information
on lawsuit filed against Energy Department after 6th graf, bgng ``Waste
production.''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Tuesday
launched a broad shakeup of nuclear weapons production, pledging to
``chart a new course'' of environmental safeguards and conceding
that a key waste storage facility has to be delayed.
   ``The chickens have finally come home to roost,'' Watkins said,
after ``years of inattention to changing standards and demands
regarding the environment, safety and health.''
   Watkins announced new steps for improving management of the
weapons production complex, including 17 major plants or
laboratories in 12 states, and for determining the extent to which
the facilities are violating state and federal environmental laws.
   He also said a New Mexico site that was scheduled to open in
September as the nation's first permanent dump for waste from the
military facilities would not begin receiving waste until sometime
in 1990. He said he had no more specific target date.
   ``We have had a flawed plan'' for opening the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, he said.
   Waste production has been reduced, which should allow the
production plants to continue operating normally until the New
Mexico site opens, he said.
   Watkins announcement came as a group of 21 environmental,
scientific and church groups sued the Energy Department to try to
force a broad public review of plans for modernizing the weapons
plants.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington said the
department should be compelled to prepare a Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement, a comprehensive analysis of the
environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives.
   Watkins declined to comment directly on the suit except to say he
was committed to ensuring full compliance with all environmental
requirements.
   At his first formal news conference since taking office last
March, Watkins said he was surprised and disappointed to learn of
the depth of problems in the weapons program, which has been
crippled by mechanical failures and safety problems.
   ``It has been a nightmare for me to unravel the background
sufficient to make a decision,'' he said, adding that he was being
forced to act ``on a crisis basis'' because of the urgent need to
get key weapons plants running again.
   Three nuclear reactors at the Savannah River Site in South
Carolina, which are the nation's only source of tritium needed for
nuclear warheads, have been shut down for more than a year because
of uncertainties about their safety. Watkins said he hoped to
announce a reactor restart scheduled in July.
   In what he called an illustration of the breadth of change he
seeks in the weapons program, Watkins said the Savannah River
restart plan would require Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs
the plant under a federal contract, to devote ``far more resources
than our own program coordinator ever demanded'' in the past.
   He said he was creating environmental ``tiger teams'' to closely
examine each weapons plant to assess its compliance with state and
federal environmental laws.
   ``This is a complete review, with my tiger teams moving out to
see to what degree we have actually been complying with the intent
as well as the letter of the law,'' Watkins said.
   The department's increased attention to health and safety issues
comes just days after the Justice Department raided the Rocky Flats
weapons plant in Colorado in search of evidence of illegal dumping
and incineration of hazardous wastes.
   Watkins was mildly critical of Justice for refusing to give him
any information about its findings at Rocky Flats, which makes
plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons.
   He said he wanted to find ``a new way of doing business in these
events in the future, if we get into this situation, because I think
it's important that we know at once whether there has been any
violation of the environment, particularly when radioactivity is
involved.''
   Watkins said Rocky Flats illustrated the extent of turmoil in the
weapons program.
   ``I cannot certify to you today, or to the public, that we know
exactly'' what is contained in radioactive waste stored at Rocky
Flats, he said. It will take another four months to ``revalidate''
the contents of the waste, he added.
   Watkins also defended President Bush's decision to nominate
Victor Stello as assistant secretary for defense programs, the top
job in the weapons program, despite what Watkins called ``the
potential controversiality'' of the choice.
   In 1987 a Senate panel conducted a hearing on whether Stello, as
executive director for operations of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, was guilty of improprieties in connection with a
commission investigation of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
   The probe included the question of whether Stello improperly
advised the manager of nuclear power at TVA on how to respond to a
commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under
construction. Stello denied any improprieties.
   ``If he has some chinks in his armour, so be it,'' Watkins said.
``I have to have somebody in here who wants to serve _ and let me
tell you, not many want in on this one _ and has the skills and
background to understand from Day One what it means to run a
reactor.''

   A Koreatown apartment exploded in flames
Tuesday as police investigated a stash of fireworks, injuring 10
police officers. A resident was later arrested for allegedly
possessing explosives.
   After the blast, a bomb squad detonated more explosives at the
two-story Victorian building in city's Koreatown section, said
police Officer Margie Reid.
   ``There was a large cache of fireworks,'' Reid said. ``They were
there on a follow-up investigation because a guy showed up at the
hospital with the fingers blown off his hands.''
   Gary Wexler, 39, was later arrested and booked for investigation
of possession of explosives after treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center for severed fingers.
   Bomb squad experts Robert Gollhofer, 46, and Dan Johnson, 34,
were inside the apartment when the 6:14 a.m. explosion occurred and
suffered cuts, burns and chest injuries. Johnson was being kept in a
hospital overnight, Reid said.
   Six officers were treated at hospitals for temporary hearing loss
and two others were treated at the scene of the explosion, Reid said.
   The officers were in the building investigating a minor fireworks
explosion several hours earlier that had severed part of Wexler's
hand. Wexler said he held a firecracker too long.
   About 35 firefighters battled the blaze at the six-unit apartment
house, about five miles west of downtown, after the blast, said Fire
Department spokesman Jim Williamson. It took a half-hour to
extinguish the fire. Damage was estimated at $140,000.

<HEAD>USC Foundation Appeals Judge's Order to Open Records To Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of South Carolina foundation
filed an appeal with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday in an effort
to keep its records from being opened to the public.
   Circuit Judge Carol Connor on Monday ordered the Carolina
Research and Development Foundation to open its records as a result
of a 1987 lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and The Greenville
News.
   The news organizations requested access to the records under the
state's Freedom of Information Act, which requires, with some
exceptions, that public bodies open their records and meetings to
the public.
   The foundation was established as a non-profit corporation to
engage in land acquisition and development for the university.
   In their lawsuit, the news organizations said the foundation had
received and spent more than $28 million in public funds.
   Foundation attorneys argued that the foundation is a private
entity separate from the university and thus is unaffected by the
law's disclosure provisions.
   But Ms. Connor agreed with the AP and The News, ruling June 13
that the foundation was subject to the Freedom of Information Act.
On Monday, Ms. Connor acted on the written order that she had
instructed the news organizations' attorneys to prepare in the
earlier ruling.
   Attorneys for the foundation filed a motion in circuit court
Tuesday requesting a stay of the order so that the foundation's
records could not be opened while the appeal was being considered.
   The judge said the ruling did not necessarily apply to all
foundations related to state schools or to businesses that receive
public money.

<TEXT>
   Pete Rose tried to get involved in cocaine
deals arranged by his associates so he could pocket tax-free cash,
and once offered to store cocaine in his house, a former associate
told baseball investigators.
   The allegation was dismissed as ``ridiculous'' by one of Rose's
lawyers.
   Paul G. Janszen, who claims he ran bets for the Cincinnati Reds
manager, told baseball investigators in February that Rose once
asked him to set up a cocaine ring and include him.
   Janszen also said Rose once said he might consider throwing a
game if he had a large bet on it. He also told investigators that
Rose checked by telephone with other major-league managers about
their players' physical status before placing bets on their teams.
   Janszen's claims were made in an interview included in thousands
of pages of exhibits to investigator John M. Dowd's report, which
was released Monday.
   It was the first time Rose has been linked to the cocaine ring
operated by former associates who ran a gymnasium in Cincinnati
where the manager worked out.
   ``This idea of Rose being involved with drugs is so far off the
wall that it's ridiculous,'' Rose lawyer Robert A. Pitcairn Jr.
said. ``(To) anyone who knows Pete Rose and has known Pete Rose over
the years, there's just no question he wouldn't get involved with
drugs.
   ``For Janszen to say this is slander of the worst kind. It's
further evidence to us that this guy will do anything to follow
through with his blackmail attempts of Pete Rose. Why Dowd's
investigators even went into areas like this is beyond me.''
   According to a spokeswoman for Dowd, the investigator said he
left the drug references out of his 225-page summary report to
baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti because it was not
relevant to the gambling inquiry.
   In other developments, the former girlfriend of a Rose associate
said she had corroborated the Dowd report's charge that Rose
conspired to hide racetrack winnings from a $47,646 Pik-Six ticket
in 1987 at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky.
   If the charges are true, Rose faces possible indictment on
charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. A federal
grand jury is investigating Rose's income taxes.
   Rose Fernbach Billiter, the former girlfriend of Thomas P.
Gioiosa, told The Associated Press that she had provided first- and
second-hand information supporting the charges to the FBI and the
Internal Revenue Service.
   Also, a Jan. 20 letter from Janszen to another attorney for Rose,
Reuven J. Katz, reveals Janszen's feelings on why his relationship
with Rose deteriorated.
   ``Because I covered for him with his wife, while he was sleeping
his way around town, she no longer wanted me in their house,''
Janszen said of Rose's wife. ``Carol doesn't have the guts to leave
him, so she has to blame his friends for his disgusting behavior.''
   Attempts to reach Mrs. Rose by telephone Tuesday were
unsuccessful.
   Rose, who faces a possible lifetime ban by baseball if it is
determined he bet on his own team, won a temporary restraining order
preventing Giamatti from holding a hearing on the charges.
Baseball's lawyers have asked a three-judge panel of an Ohio appeals
court to suspend the restraining order and Rose's response is due
Wednesday.
   Janszen, who recently completed a four-month sentence for failure
to report income, didn't say that Rose used drugs, but he said the
manager thought he could get cash from drug deals conducted by a
circle of associates. Several of the associates were sentenced after
federal authorities cracked a ring that smuggled cocaine from
Florida to Ohio.
   Gioiosa faces trial in Cincinnati next month on charges of tax
evasion and conspiring to arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida to
Cincinnati between 1985 and 1987.
   Gold's Gym, where Rose worked out, was operated by Donald J.
Stenger, who admitted smuggling 40 to 50 kilograms of cocaine from
Florida to Cincinnati. Stenger was given an 10-year prison sentence
last March following a guilty plea.
   Michael E. Fry, who owned the gym, is serving an eight-year term
for cocaine trafficking and tax evasion.
   During his interview last February with baseball investigators,
Janszen said that Rose showed him a copy of his income tax return in
1987.
   ``He showed me that and he told me at the same time, `Paul, if
you get me involved and if you can, if you will set up a cocaine
organization and include me in it, you can spend as much money as
you ever want to because if they ever come to you and say where do
you get your money, I will tell them from Pete Rose,''' Janszen said.
   Janszen also said Rose told him that Gioiosa, a former housemate
of the manager, brought a suitcase with $200,000 into the Reds'
clubhouse sometime during 1987 and showed Rose the money, which
supposedly was going to be used to buy cocaine in Florida.
   Janszen said that when he asked Rose why he wanted to get
involved in cocaine, Rose responded that he had a certificate of
deposit for $65,000 or $75,000 that was maturing in a few weeks. He
quoted Rose as saying:
   ``I'll use that money and buy the kilos and I'll keep them in my
house because nobody would have the ----- to come to my house.''

<HEAD>British Philosopher A. J. Ayer Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the British philosopher who
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, died Tuesday night. He was 78.
   Ayer died after a lengthy respiratory illness in University
College Hospital, said journalist Nigella Lawson, whose late mother,
Vanessa, was Ayer's third wife.
   Ayer was known to generations as A. J. Ayer and to friends as
``Freddie.''
   His first book, ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' in 1936 was the
first exposition of logical positivism in the English language.
   The movement, which Ayer helped to develop in Britain, expounds
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, and that any idea that cannot in principle be
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical.
   Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, it accepts that language
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument.
   The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates
many British and American universities.
   ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' which jolted the metaphysicians by
its assault on ``much of what has passed for philosophy,'' owed a
debt to empiricists such as Russell and Rudolph Carnap. It brought
the term ``logical positivist'' to the attention of British
academics.
   ``I maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy to
warrant the existence of conflicting philosophical `schools,''' he
wrote. ``And I attempt to substantiate this by providing a
definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief
sources of controversy between philosophers in the past.''
   ``The principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply because
we never allow them to be anything else,'' he added.
   Ayer wrote ``The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in 1940 and
``The Problem of Knowledge'' in 1956, as well as volumes of
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he
extended the traditions of British empiricism.
   Born Oct. 29, 1910, Ayer was the only child of a French-Swiss
father and a Dutch-Jewish mother. His father, Jules, a timber
merchant, became a naturalized British subject before the birth of
his son.
   Educated at Eton and at Oxford University, he was a philosophy
lecturer and research student at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1932 to
1944, and dean of Wadham College, Oxford in 1945-1946. He served as
an intelligence officer in France during World War II.
   Ayer was professor of mind and logic at University College London
from 1946 to 1959, then professor of logic at the University of
Oxford and fellow of New College, Oxford, until 1978.
   He was a visiting professor at New York University in 1948-1949,
at City College, New York, in 1961-1962, and at Bard College in New
York State, from 1987.
   Ayer earned a first-class literary humanities degree at Oxford
University in 1932, then spent several months in Vienna where he
came under the lasting influence of the Werner Kreis, a school of
Austrian philosophers dominated by Wittgenstein and Carnap.
   In the 1930s, he introduced and popularized at Oxford University
severe Viennese philosophical attitudes when Oxford philosophy was
considered vague and explanatory rather than opinionated.
   Ayer married Grace Lees in 1932, and they had two children. His
second marriage, to American journalist Dee Wells, ended in divorce
23 years later in 1983. He then married Vanessa Lawson, former wife
of Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. She died two
years later.

   Israel's national airline made its first
direct flight to the Soviet Union on Tuesday and brought 61
survivors of the Armenian earthquake to Israel for six weeks of
treatment.
   The 49 amputees and 12 victims suffering from multiple fractures,
known as the ``crush syndrome,'' came slowly down the ramp. Those
able to walk supported themselves with crutches as they limped off,
taking their first look at the Jewish state that gathered them in
for six weeks of medical treatment.
   The El Al Boeing 757 took off for Yerevan, the capital of the
Soviet Armenian republic, at 1:30 p.m. and returned to Ben Gurion
airport from its historic flight nine hours later.
   Israeli officials and Archbishop Kerkin Kazanjian, head of the
Armenian Church in Jerusalem, greeted the survivors. Israeli
immigrants from Armenia brought flowers.
   Health Minister Yaakov Tzur told reporters at the airport, ``This
definitely shows we are experiencing a new relationship with the
Soviet Union.''
   Moscow cut diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East war in a show of solidarity with Arab nations. The Soviet Union
and Israel exchanged low-level consular delegations in 1987.
   The Armenian patients looked confused and smiled uneasily upon
their arrival. During the 2{-hour flight from Soviet Armenia, many
burst into tears recalling the ordeal of the Dec. 7 earthquake that
left an estimated 25,000 dead, many thousands injured and 500,000
homeless.
   ``I lost 18 classmates in the earthquake,'' said 17-year-old Egor
Khatchaturian of hard-hit Spitak.
   ``They told me a week ago that I was going to Israel. I feel very
well. I hope they will make a prosthesis for me,'' he said.
   Khatchaturian, who lost his left leg, could not recall what he
did after the quake and wept the moment the disaster was mentioned.
   The youth was traveling alone, his parents back in Armenia.
Clutching his crutches, he sat silently in an armchair, dressed in
blue sports jacket and blue hat.
   An Armenian team of two doctors and four nurses accompanied the
victims. They will be trained in Israel to provide the pateints with
follow-up treatment.
   In Yerevan, Armenian officials held a reception for the Israeli
group and laid out cheese, meat, vodka and Armenian cognac.
   On the main table, an Israeli flag stood beside the red-and-blue
Armenian flag. The restaurant band played Hava Nagila, the popular
Israeli tune, as officials of the American Jewish Joint Distribution
Committee performed a lively dance.
   ``I hope the time will come when planeloads like yours will land
in Yerevan without any disaster having prompted their visit,'' said
Narine Balayan, the Armenian minister of social affairs who acted as
host.
   The mood grew quieter as survivors emerged one by one from the
main building and were carried onto the plane. A bearded Armenian
approached and made the sign of cross on their foreheads.
   ``Go with God,'' somebody muttered.
   The New-York based JDC, a Jewish relief group, sponsored the
mission after collecting about $500,000 in donations. The money will
be used to build a rehabilitation clinic in Leninacan, Armenia, and
to bring victims for treatment in Israel.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav saw off the flight to Yerevan and
described it as a new stage in the thawing relations between the two
countries.
   Katzav said, ``It is primarily a humanitarian operation, but
Israel is interested and is looking forward to a resumption of
diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.''
   The plane also carried to Armenia 10 tons of medicine and medical
equipment accidently shipped to Israel by a Dutch relief agency, a
Jerusalem municipal spokeswoman said.
   Israel sent military medics to the Soviet Union during the last
year to help victims of the Armenian earthquake and of a rail
disaster in the Ural Mountains.

   The House on Tuesday approved plans to require
the government to collect and publish for five years statistics on
crimes based on the race, ethic group, sexual preference or religion
of the victims.
   ``This legislation is an opportunity to begin the counterattack
against crimes based on hate,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
D-N.Y., as the House approved the measure 368-47 and sent it to the
Senate.
   Supporters said the nation is being hit by a growing wave of
so-called hate crimes, ranging from gang attacks on members of
minority groups to cross burnings and the spray painting of
swastikas and bigoted slogans.
   Under the bill, statistics would be collected on homicide,
assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism, trespassing,
threats and others deemed appropriate by the Justice Department if
they involved bias involving race, ethnicity, sexual preference or
religion.
   The House has passed similar measures in the past but the Senate
has not acted. A hate crimes bill was approved by the Senate
Judiciary Committee on March 9 and supporters are hoping for a floor
vote.
   The FBI publishes annual crime statistics but does not include
hate crimes. Supporters have relied on unofficial reports and
anecdotal information from news accounts in estimating that the
problem is growing worse.
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said 1,281 anti-semitic incidents were
reported by the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith in 1988. He
said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported 7,008
incidents of anti-gay violence in 1987. ``There is also evidence of
growing Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead and other hate group activity
throughout the nation,'' Green said.
   ``The tremendous rise in crimes against minorities is widespread
and extremely serious,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said.
   Compiling data on such acts would help in fighting them,
supporters said ``The more we know about crimes of hate the more
chance we have of preventing them,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly,
D-Conn.
   ``Congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimes
based on race, religion or sexuality will not be tolerated,'' said
Rep. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Constitutional Amendment Banning Flag Desecration</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS name of Ted Weiss in 8th graf, bgng ``But Rep.''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring the American flag a
``unique national symbol,'' Tuesday called for a constitutional
amendment to set aside last week's Supreme Court decision and forbid
flag desecration.
   ``As president, I will uphold our precious right to dissent, but
burning the flag goes too far, and I want to see that matter
remedied,'' he said at a news conference.
   His announcement came as efforts already were advancing in
Congress to condemn last week's decision extending First Amendment
free speech rights to protesters who burn the flag.
   The House voted 411-5 Tuesday night for a resolution that
expressed ``profound concern'' over the court decision and called
for ``continued commitment to preserving the honor and integrity of
the flag as a living symbol of our nation.''
   The resolution, whose chief sponsor was House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, also ``condemns all actions intended
to desecrate the American flag'' and urged Americans to display the
flag.
   Brooks said the committee would begin hearings soon to ``examine
the matter from the standpoint of the need for constitutional
amendment or statutory remedies.''
   House members used the resolution to vent their feelings. Rep.
Carroll Hubbard Jr., D-Ky., said those who burn the flag should
``consider moving to Iran, China or Cuba, where burning the flag ...
is encouraged.''
   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., deploring desecration of the flag,
said the court acted correctly: ``I exult in the decision ...
because the Supreme Court has has validated once again the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.''
   ``We should be careful of a reckless tampering with the
Constitution,'' he said.
   Voting against the resolution were Reps. Weiss; Gus Savage,
D-Ill.; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.; William Clay, D-Mo., and George W.
Crockett Jr., D-Mich.
   Bush, who made patriotism, the flag and the pledge of allegiance
a central theme in his 1988 presidential campaign, asserted, ``I
think respect for the flag transcends political party and I think
what I've said here is American. It isn't Republican or Democrat, it
isn't liberal or conservative.''
   He said adding an amendment to the Constitution would be the only
foolproof way to set aside the Supreme Court ruling, which nullified
flag-desecration laws in 48 states.
   However, the process is a lengthy one _ requiring two-thirds
votes in both House and Senate and then ratification by no less than
38 state legislatures. In the Constitution's 200-year history,
thousands of amendments have been proposed but only 26 have been
ratified.
   Still, Bush said, ``the importance of this issue compels me to
call for a constitutional amendment.''
   ``Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecration
of the American flag,'' he added. ``Protection of the flag _ a
unique national symbol _ will in no way limit the opportunity nor
the breadth of protest available in the exercise of free speech
rights.''
   Bush's comments were praised by conservatives but denounced by
civil-liberties groups.
   ``We think it violates the fundamental principle of this nation
that every person has a right to express their views and express
them in a way they choose, no matter how obnoxious the majority find
those views,'' said Morton Halperin, Washington director of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   David Cole, staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, said: ``The First Amendment has survived for 200 years
without exceptions. It is outrageous for the president to urge that
we deviate from the fundamental principles of toleration and freedom
of expression.''
   Last week, the Senate by voice vote added language to child-care
legislation that would make desecration of the flag punishable by a
maximum $1,000 fine and a year in prison.
   However, this language would not be added to the Constitution and
therefore could be overturned by the Supreme Court.
   Senators also voted 97-3 for a resolution expressing ``profound
disappointment'' in the court ruling and pledging to ``seek ways to
restore sanctions against such reprehensible conduct.''
   A number of proposed constitutional amendments on the subject
have been introduced in both houses. No hearings have yet been
scheduled.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he supported Bush's call
even though he harbored an ``instinctive conservative's dislike'' of
ameding the Constitution.
   The court decision ``leaves me with no alternative,'' Michel said.
   ``Unfurl the flag, fly it, flaunt it, argue about it if you want
to, but don't desecrate it _ that's all we're asking. Surely that
view reflects the common sense of the American people,'' Michel said.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., one of numerous lawmakers to propose
constitutional amendments to overturn the decision, said, ``With the
president's backing I intend to move forward expeditiously. This
egregious decision by the court must be corrected.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who has criticized the court
decision while voicing objections to amending the Constitution to
overturn it, reacted angrily to suggestions that Republicans could
make flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats fail to support a
constitutional amendment.
   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,''
Foley said. But he added that anyone who does so with the flag issue
would be ``playing the most cynical politics ... for the most base
and crass political purposes.''
   In his 1988 campaign, Bush frequently blasted Democratic opponent
Gov. Michael Dukakis for vetoing a Massachusetts law requiring
public school teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of
allegiance.
   Bush said during the campaign that, if he had been governor, he
would have found ways to make the law stick. He reinforced his theme
by visiting a flag factory.
   On Tuesday, asked if he hadn't used the flag for partisan
purposes during that campaign, Bush responded: ``Everything I did
last year was for the purpose of advancing my _ everything I did
politically _ advancing my election. But I didn't put it on the
basis that Republicans are for the flag and Democrats are not.''
   On another court-related topic, Bush was asked about recent
Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action that have drawn
criticism from civil rights groups _ rulings making it harder for
employees to bring discrimination cases against employers.
   Bush said he had been assured by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
that follow-up legislation was unnecessary.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico Citry
ordered the police intelligence unit disbanded Tuesday after three
commanders were charged in a murder plot that led to the death of an
investigative journalist.
   In a statement, he branded as intolerable their purported
involvement in the May 30, 1984, death of columnist Manuel Buendia.
   He said the order to disband the Intelligence Division of Mexico
City Police because of the Buendia case and ``other crimes'' was
effective at once.
   The brief statement gave no details.
   Commanders Juventino Prado Hurtado, Sofia Naya Suarez and Raul
Perez Carmona were charged over the weekend with Buendia's murder.
All three said they were tortured into confessing.
   Authorities say the men acted on orders of Jose Antonio Zorrilla
Perez, then head of the Federal Security Administration. All three
served as officers under Zorrilla in the agency, which was the
Mexican equivalent of the FBI but was disbanded for corruption in
1985.
   Zorrilla, 47, is under indictment as having masterminded
Buendia's murder. He faces other charges, including obstructing
justice and abuse of authority.
   Authorities say Zorrilla feared that Buendia would expose his
lucrative links with Mexican narcotics kingpins.
   Zorrilla denies ordering Buendia's death.
   The intelligence police have been under fire by human rights
activists, public officials and the press since the unit was created
late last year as part of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
crime-fighting program.
   The first commander, Miguel Nazar Haro, is wanted in San Diego on
a 1982 U.S. indictment alleging he was part of an auto theft and
auto smuggling ring.
   The unit also was assailed for its role in quelling a prison riot
in Tepic, 500 miles from Mexico City. A videotape viewed by The
Associated Press indicated that six prisoners who surrendered were
later shot.
   Repeated demands were made in the Federal District Assembly, the
capital's equivalent of a city council, for disbanding the unit,
which was accused of illegal detentions, torture and extortion.
   In March, intelligence agents were accused of detaining nine
women coming home from an illegal abortion clinic. The women said
they were beaten and their elderly doctor was tortured before they
were released without charge 14 hours later.
   Police and city officials refused to discuss the incident but
they closed down the intelligence police's notorious detention
center, Tlaxcoaque, in April.
   Reps. Victor Orduna, chairman of the Justice Administration
Committee of the Federal District Assembly, and Ramon Sosamontes,
chairman of the Public Safety Committee, and human rights groups
told the AP the intelligence police have been using four other
locations as clandestine jails since then.

   A booby trap bomb killed a
police reservist in a country hamlet late Tuesday, hours after an
incendiary bomb exploded in a paint store in Londonderry, injuring
13 people.
   David Black, 34, a full-time reserve constable, died when a bomb
exploded under his car outside his home in Ballymagorry, 12 miles
south of Londonderry, said Belfast press officer Sgt. Margaret
Breakey.
   Black, married with an 18-month-old daughter, was on his way to
visit his recently widowed mother, Breakey said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has targeted security
forces in its campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland.
   Black joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary's reserve unit 10
years ago, Breakey said. The 4,600-member force, which includes many
part-time officers, supplements the province's 8,200-member main
police force.
   Earlier Tuesday, the outlawed IRA claimed responsibility for
planting a device at a paint shop in Londonderry, British
Broadcasting Corp. TV reported.
   Police said they checked the shop and found nothing, but after
they left, an incendiary device detonated and set the shop afire.
   Ten adults and three children were treated for burns and shock at
Altnagelvin Hospital, police said. An 8-year-old boy and three
women, including the boy's mother, were admitted.
   Witnesses said paint cans burst in the heat of the fire.
   Police said two men claiming to speak for the IRA made an
anonymous telephone call Tuesday warning of bombs in the paint shop
and four other sites.
   No bombs were found at the offices of British Telecom and other
locations mentioned, police said.
   Police removed a bomb from a hijacked city bus parked at the
railway station, but another bomb on a bus left on a bridge exploded
Tuesday night. No one was injured, police said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Tom King, the top British official in the
province, visited Londonderry to announce that British Telecom would
be hiring 80 people to staff a new directory inquiries center in the
city.
   ``The Provisionals (IRA) responded in the only way they know, to
bomb, to disfigure and to maim,'' King said after the paint store
explosion.
   Alexander Cameron, 22, died in a Belfast hospital Tuesday 10 days
after he was beaten with a hatchet. Police said Cameron had been
sleeping beside a pile of wood in a Protestant district of the city.
News reports said his attackers fled into a Catholic neighborhood.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years of political
and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. The IRA wants to unite
the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.

   Death penalty opponents are calling for new
state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the
wake of Supreme Court rulings they say are ``medieval and barbaric.''
   ``To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before
they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,''
said American Bar Association President Robert Raven.
   Of the 37 states permitting capital punishment, 15 now bar its
use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18.
   The court, voting 5-4, said Monday the Constitution does not bar
states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young
as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers.
   In the case of the mentally retarded, the justices said convicted
murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider
their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the
death penalty.

   Three weekend oil spills have given new urgency
to a review of traffic control in the nation's busiest shipping
lanes, a process that began after the Exxon Valdez shipwreck raised
questions about safety.
   ``The waterways are crowded. Like any system, it doesn't work 100
percent, and accidents do happen,'' says Rear Adm. Robert Nelson,
chief of the Coast Guard navigation safety office.
   The review, the first in 15 years, will look at volume of traffic

said. It will take several months to complete.

   Despite mixed reviews, ``Batman'' earned a
record $42.7 million in its first three days and the caped
crusader's financial heroics carried Hollywood to an unprecedented
$95 million weekend.
   Figures released Monday showed the Warner Bros. movie demolished
the previous opening-weekend record set the week before by
``Ghostbusters II,'' which grossed $29.5 million.
   ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack
Nicholson as the Joker, also scaled new heights for the best opening
day ($15.3 million) on Friday; and the biggest Saturday ($14.6
million) and Sunday ($12.7 million) gates in movie history.
   Those figures were rounded; the exact figures yielded the $42.7
million gross, according to John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co.,
which tracks box-office performance.

   Former House Speaker Jim Wright says he's
leaving Congress for good on Friday, ending speculation that he
might seek re-election to the seat that ethics charges forced him to
give up.
   Wright issued a statement saying he is gratified by supporters'
calls for him to seek re-election _ and political vindication _ in a
special vote to be called after he steps down.
   ``As deeply as I appreciate the devoted friendship which impels
these sincere petitions, I must conclude that I was right in
announcing my retirement from Congress,'' the Fort Worth, Texas,
Democrat said Monday.
   ``It is best for the institution and best for the people whom
I've served that I step aside now and make room for others,'' he
said. He said his nearly 35-year House career will end Friday and he
will not seek elective office again.

   A survey of more than 3,000 adults suggests that
if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s, most Americans missed
it.
   The survey, conducted in 1970 but published this week for the
first time, found that Americans overwhelmingly disapproved of
prostitution, extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely
opposed to homosexuality.
   ``The number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is
exaggerated, I think, just as the number of homosexuals in the
population has been exaggerated,'' one of the study's authors,
Eugene F. Levitt, a psychologist at the Indiana University School of
Medicine, said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The survey, which could help researchers understand how AIDS
spreads, was not released for so long because two of its authors
fought over whose name should appear first on the title page, said
Hubert J. O'Gorman, who edited the survey report to be published
Thursday.

   Volume control and the absence of mosquitoes,
ants and rain are some of the advantages of spending the Fourth of
July in front of the tube.
   A few of the guests on holiday television specials are also
unlikely to show up at the family picnic, not to mention some
spectacular fireworks displays.
   But regardless how spectacular is TV's version of July Fourth, it
is traditionally the lowest viewing period of the year. Most
Americans prefer to celebrate Independence Day with the real thing,
even if it means listening to Uncle Herbert instead of Henry Mancini
or waving a sparkler in the back yard rather than watching the
rockets' red glare over the Jefferson Memorial.
   But for those stuck indoors, or who choose to be inside,
television is doing its part.
   CBS gets an early start on the festivities with a
pre-Independence Day special Monday, ``Freedom Festival '89.'' Buena
Vista Television is syndicating a live Fourth of July special from
Walt Disney World. But the patriotic place to be is the nation's
capital, and PBS takes viewers there with its traditional ``Capitol
Fourth'' concert.
   Patrick Duffy of ``Dallas'' is host of the one-hour CBS special,
which was taped outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall.
   The show is a string of tributes: to the music of the street by
Philly native Frankie Avalon, to America's musical heritage by the
Oak Ridge Boys, to the nation's ethnic diversity by Nell Carter and
the Philadelphia Mummers, and to freedom by Take 6, the a capella
singing group.
   Public television stations will offer ``A Capitol Fourth 1989''
on Tuesday night, a traditional live concert from the grounds of the
U.S. Capitol where thousands gather with picnics to enjoy the music
and the fireworks.
   E.G. Marshall is host this year of the 90-minute broadcast.
Musical guests include James Galway, Henry Mancini, Pearl Bailey and
Peter Nero. James Conlon conducts the National Symphony Orchestra.
   The 1989 ``Capitol Fourth'' is the 10th in the concert series.
Highlights include flutist Galway's participation in a salute to
Mancini _ with Mancini conducting the orchestra. Pianist Nero plans
to play George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue.'' Bailey will sing
``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ``God Bless America.'' Conlon,
currently music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic, will lead
the NSO in the traditional rousing medley of Sousa marches for the
finale _ the fireworks display over the Washington Monument.
   Buena Vista's ``Walt Disney World 4th of July Spectacular'' is
also live Tuesday night and has been syndicated in 95 percent of the
nation's television markets. The prime-time, two-hour special stars
the rock group New Kids on the Block, gospel singer Sandi Patti,
weatherman Willard Scott, Miss America and the cast of the new
Mickey Mouse Club.
   The special, set at Walt Disney World, will include a look at new
attractions at the amusement park, coverage of the Walt Disney
World's traditional Fourth of July parades and a musical salute to
Independence Day.

   Felicita Rodriguez is ready to start her life
over.
   ``I have a future in front of me,'' said the 24-year-old resident
of New York City's lower East Side. ``A better future.''
   That future includes a high school equivalency degree, a job and
the chance to raise her two young children properly. Rodriguez said
it won't include using or selling drugs, which is what got her into
trouble in the first place.
   It also got her into state prison.
   ``This inmate thinks she can do it,'' she said. ``I know I'm
special now.''
   Rodriguez and 14 other women this month became the first female
platoon to complete New York state's shock incarceration program.
About 1,400 of the state's 40,000 prison inmates are women.
   While doing their six months at the shock camp, the women
followed an intense regime of military drills, manual labor,
exercise, remedial education and drug and alcohol counseling. They
lost weight, gained some self-respect _ and won their freedom
earlier than they would have in a traditional prison.
   They opted into the program, trading a tough six months in an
environment very much like a Marine boot camp for a shorter prison
term.
   First-time, non-violent offenders sentenced to three years or
less in prison who complete the shock program are immediately
eligible for parole. That means they can cut up to 2{ years off
their minimum prison time.
   That's good news for the state, whose prisons are so overcrowded
that officials recently decided to start housing inmates in prison
gymnasiums. And it's very good news for inmates who want to go home
early.
   ``I'm going home and growing my hair,'' said Christine Conti, a
cocaine dealer, as she stuffed her possessions in a paper bag and
prepared for a ride home to New Jersey. The women in shock camp
don't have to shave their heads as closely as the male inmates, but
their hair is cut to about collar length.
   Conti, 25, said most of the other shock inmates ``thought I was
crazy'' because she liked the running and the strenuous exercise
that begins every day at 5:30 a.m. But other aspects of the military
life didn't sit as well.
   ``The worst part is the mess hall,'' she said. ``I like to talk
when I eat ... You can't talk. You can't even look.''
   Sherrell Radcliffe, 26, of Rochester, couldn't wait to get out of
the fatigues she'd been wearing for six months. ``I keep looking at
what everyone else is wearing,'' she said of inmates' friends and
relatives at graduation.
   Superintendent Rosetta Burke said the military basis of the shock
program teaches the inmates responsibility, discipline and respect,
traits most had ``very little grounding'' in before.
   Conti said drug counseling helped her get over a cocaine
addiction. Before shock camp, she said, ``I wouldn't have told you I
was a drug addict. They taught me how to open up and deal with my
problem.''
   Other programs taught her she didn't ``always have to say
something about everything.
   ``When I first came in here, I was trying to tell the lady how to
run the community meeting. That's how I was. I wouldn't listen to
anybody.''
   The women who completed shock camp this month were effusive in
praising the program and thanking the staff. That may be because the
program is voluntary.
   Inmates who don't like it can transfer back to a regular prison
and their longer sentences. Troublemakers are sent back.
   The platoon of 15 started out with 25 women six months ago, most
of them convicted of drug charges. One woman owes a month because
she was hospitalized during her shock term. Another left for medical
reasons. Five were kicked out because of disciplinary problems.
   Inmates like the three who chose to go back to prison ``can't
take it any more,'' said Burke. ``They don't like getting yelled at.
They don't like getting up in the morning. They don't like the
responsibility.
   ``We don't let them off the hook.''
   While all of the graduating platoon spoke sincerely of new,
brighter futures, the odds are that a few of them will get in
trouble again. Shock inmates have a 17 percent to 19 percent
recidivism rate, Burke said. However, the average prison inmate
return rate is 25 percent.
   That improvement _ and the millions the state can save through
shorter prison terms _ has prompted Gov. Mario Cuomo to propose
raising the current 26-year age cap for shock camp to 29. The shock
programs operated by a growing number of states _ Louisiana and
Mississippi also have graduated classes of women _ have attracted
the attention of national drug policy chief William Bennett, who is
interested in it for federal prisons.
   Several of the women leaving the camp about 50 miles west of
Albany cried as they said their goodbyes to each other and to their
guards, who kept up their drill sergeants' roles to the end.
   As the platoon fell into formation to march their last drill,
chanting loudly, to the graduation ceremony, one officer barked:
   ``Don't march like girls. March like shock graduates!''

<BYLINE>Where Are Automotive Stocks Headed?</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through marketing ingenuity, incentives, good
design, improved quality and sheer persistence, automakers have
managed to stretch their selling cycle long beyond its usual
lifespan.
   Now they are faced with another situation: With the delayed but
inevitable end of their growth cycle appearing on the horizon, can
they manage to maintain their stock prices until the next upturn?
   Automaking is a cyclical industry, meaning it has at least as
many ups and downs as the economy itself. The pattern is as distinct
as in real estate: a rising demand, overproduction, big inventories,
a downturn and a recovery.
   It's been a bit different this time. Amid intense competition,
the carmakers developed techniques to shift the production mix _
cars vs. trucks, for example _ offer discounts and below-market
interest rates, and fine-tune production.
   In so doing they demonstrated that the cycle can indeed be
stretched, if only to a point. Now, with indications it could snap _
July output may be at an annual rate of only 5 million cars, lowest
for any month since 1982 _ you might think the appeal of automaker
stocks would fall. But it might not.
   With industry earnings heading for a second-half decline,
automotive stocks still remain in many portfolios, one reason being
that analysts believe the automakers might be able to do for their
stocks what they did for their sales.
   How do you keep stock prices up?
   _By using the money you earned in the good times to buy back your
stocks, as General Motors and Ford are doing, thus tending to
maintain the supply-demand ratio.
   _By maintaining dividends at a rate higher than most blue chips.
General Motors current dividend yield is 6.6 percent, Ford's 6.2
percent and Chrysler's 4.8 percent.
   _By making operations more efficient, thus buffering earnings to
some degree against a sales downturn.
   Ford often is cited as the best example of improved operating
efficiency. Moreover, it chose to meet demand in the good days by
expanding overtime rather than expanding plants. It costs less to
reduce overtime than to close a plant.
   Still another factor, low price-earnings ratios, conceivably
could protect share prices. GM sells for six times earnings, Ford
four and Chrysler five. For the market as a whole, the P-E is in the
double digits.
   Reflecting some of these considerations, The Value Line
Investment Survey offers these views of the Big Three automakers on
the eve of a sales downturn:
   GENERAL MOTORS. ``We look for negative quarterly matchups for the
remainder of `89, and expect the full-year's earnings to decline by
about 12 percent ...
   These shares have impressive total return potential for the
three- to five-year term. In the meantime, (they) provide an
above-average yield based on a secure payout ....''
   FORD. ``We expect Ford shares to keep pace with the market in the
year ahead, protected from most downside risk by a secure dividend
that provides an attractive yield.''
   CHRYSLER. ``Patient investors should keep this stock in mind.
Although recent earnings comparisons suggest the stock is only
likely to be an average performer in the year ahead, we project
sharply improved earnings for the company by 1992-1994.
   If it turns out that way, the major automakers may have succeeded
not just in muting the ups and downs of the car market but of the
stock market too.''

   The drugs, booze, divorces and deaths may
have softened the cockiness just a bit, but pioneer rocker Jerry Lee
Lewis still has plenty left as he tries for a recording comeback
spurred by a new movie on his tumultuous life.
   ``I'm as good as I ever was, if not better,'' Lewis said about
recent performances and his soundtrack for the movie ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' starring Dennis Quaid.
   The soundtrack demonstrates that Lewis still knows how to rock
'n' roll, with remakes of such classics as ``Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On'' and ``Great Balls of Fire.''
   As for the movie itself, Lewis said he enjoyed Quaid's acting but
didn't give too many points to accuracy. ``This is a movie, and it
needs to be accepted as just a movie.''
   Initially, there was talk that Quaid, who has his own band, would
perform at least some of the songs in the movie. Lewis had to
audition to get the job.
   ``All the way on the plane he was saying, `This is ridiculous.
Jerry Lee auditioning for himself.' But he pulled it off great,''
said his former manager, Jerry Schilling.
   Schilling is also creative projects manager for the Graceland
Division of Elvis Presley Enterprises. He and Lewis parted this year
after Lewis was quoted in print as calling Presley a dummy who
wasted his talent.
   ``Jerry Lee says some things that can be very damaging. A lot of
times, he's striking out at himself,'' Schilling said.
   Lewis wants to record again _ if he can do it his way.
   With his pumpin' piano and wild stage antics, Lewis was at the
top of the rock world in the late 1950s.
   Presley, then the undisputed king of rock 'n' roll, had been
drafted into the Army, and Lewis was regarded as a possible
contender for Presley's crown. But his rocket to fame, launched by
records cut at the old Sun Studio in Memphis, was deflected by a
scandal over his marriage to 13-year-old cousin Myra Brown.
   ``It totally destroyed his career,'' said the former Mrs. Lewis,
now Myra Williams. ``He went from making $10,000 a night to $200 a
night. That's starvation wages when you're trying to travel on the
road and pay a band.''
   Lewis, then 22, was advised to keep the marriage quiet, but he
insisted on showing off his young bride on a concert tour to
England. Lewis knew the marriage would upset people, but he didn't
care. The reaction, however, was stronger than expected. ``It didn't
quite go like I thought it was going to go,'' he said.
   ``Jerry has been headstrong all his life,'' Williams said. ``You
just couldn't tell him anything. You couldn't stop him from doing
anything.''
   Now married to a real estate broker in Atlanta, Williams wrote
the book on which the movie is based.
   At 53, Lewis has been on the road all of his life, sometimes
playing 200 or more dates a year. And though he's had long dry
spells between records, and often found himself snarled by tangled
finances and business squabbles, his stage show has kept its fire.
   His recording career, which peaked in the 1950s, blossomed again
in the late '70s with such country hits as ``Middle-Age Crazy'' and
``I'm Gonna Find It Where I Can.'' He did well in the early `80s
with ``39 and Holding'' and ``Over the Rainbow,'' then took a break
from recording to concentrate on live shows.
   ``I just got so tired and bogged down with that country style,
slow-singing, beer-drinking type music. I just had to kind of get
out of it,'' he said. ``It's great music, don't get me wrong. But I
like to rock 'n' roll.''
   Lewis has made hundreds of thousands of dollars over his career,
but he likes his money in cash and has tastes that run to flashy
jewelry and fancy cars rather than ledger books. He filed for
bankruptcy last year and hasn't had a hit record in quite a while.
He told the bankruptcy court he will make about $200,000 from
``Great Balls of Fire.''
   Dogged by the Internal Revenue Service, he's had trouble getting
concert dates. The worst may be over, thanks to the movie and to
efforts begun in 1987 to clean up his image with promoters.
   Lewis recently completed a three-week stint in Las Vegas and
headlined two large concerts in California and Colorado. But those
jobs would have been closed to him two years ago.
   ``I tried to get him in Las Vegas for six months, and they
literally laughed at me,'' Schilling said. ``Evidently, there was
some bad past history with Jerry Lee in Vegas.''

<HEAD>Arab Day Labor Is Controversial Issue in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to keep Palestinian day
laborers in a fenced-in compound while they wait to be hired in
Petah Tikva has fueled debate over the wisdom and morality of using
Arabs to work in Israel.
   Critics of restrictions on Arab laborers say the practice is
similar to what Nazis did to Jews in Germany, but proponents
maintain that after 18 months of a violent Palestinian uprising in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, restrictions are necessary for safety
and security.
   Caught in the middle are the Arabs, who usually work as
construction laborers, street cleaners, garbage collectors and at
other menial jobs, and their employers, who pay them about half what
Israeli workers would have to be paid.
   In the West Bank settlement of Ariel, officials backed down from
a plan to make the Arabs wear tags labeling them ``alien workers''
after critics compared them to the yellow Stars of David that Jews
were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.
   When the town council in Petah Tikva, a city of 150,000 six miles
east of Tel Aviv, approved the holding area for Arab workers in May,
some Israeli newspapers said it amounted to a ``temporary prison.''
   The original plan called for a fenced-in holding pen where Arab
workers would be required to show their identity cards and wait to
be hired.
   But after the public outcry, the town decided to do away with
plans for the fence and a legal requirement that workers wait inside.
   Instead, a metal-frame shelter with a green plastic roof was
erected over three park benches; a portable toilet was put up
nearby. On one recent day, the shelter was empty and several Arab
workers waited at a corner about 100 yards away.
   ``People are afraid to go to the shelter,'' said one of the
workers, identifying himself as only as Faisal. ``They are afraid of
the police or of citizens here who might plant bombs or shoot guns
at us.''
   Avraham Oren, a Petah Tikva town council member who opposes the
shelter, said it would probably never be used because of the
controversy it has caused.
   ``This idea that it is possible to put people in pens is like
segregation of the races,'' he said.
   But council spokesman Shuki Yelin defended the shelter, saying it
was meant to ease fears by Jewish parents that their children might
be attacked by Arabs on the streets.
   ``We built it because ... many Jewish citizens protested and sent
petitions, saying they are suffering because of the presence of the
Arabs near their houses,'' Yelin said.
   ``It's not racist. We know we are criticized, but it's not a
jail. We don't force them to go. It's an open place.''
   Similarly expressed fears have been behind other moves to
restrict Arab workers.
   Mayor Zvi Zilker of the southern Israeli town of Ashdod
temporarily barred all Palestinian laborers recently after a soldier
was killed nearby and another disappeared and was believed
kidnapped. Police said they suspected Palestinians from the Gaza
Strip in both cases.
   After the attacks on soldiers, the Israeli government also began
requiring Gaza Arabs to obtain new work permits and restricting
those with records of crime or security offenses.
   But right-wing calls for barring all Arab workers from Israel
have brought an outcry from employers who depend on them.
   The issue has opened up a debate that touches not only Israel's
economy but also many Israelis' vision of their country as a bulwark
of Jewish morality that does not condone exploiting the Arabs.
   Professor Ehpraim Yuchtman-Yaar, a social psychologist at Tel
Aviv University, says Israelis are torn between dependence on Arab
workers and guilt over their treatment.
   ``People recognize the labor is vital for the Israeli economy,''
he said. ``They are doing low-status jobs that Israelis prefer not
to do. But morally, many Israelis feel the Arabs should be treated
equally to Jewish workers. ... Because they are not, it is
exploitation and should be denounced.''
   Moshe Semyonov, a Tel Aviv University sociologist, says the
segregation of Arabs is being fostered by a curious alliance between
right-wing Israelis and traditionalists who see the use of Arab
labor crushing their dream of an Israel built by Jews.
   ``People on both ends of the political spectrum are against
depending on Arabs _ one out of antagonism, the other for humanistic
or moral reasons,'' Semyonov said.

<TEXT>MEMPHIS: in Vegas.''    Bad history has always been with Lewis,
and he hasn't been bashful about letting people know that he acts how he
likes, when he likes.    ``Jerry Lee is a rebel. He's not some namby-pamby,''
said his sister, Linda Gail Stefanow. ``I think he's a lot more of a hero
than people realize. He wouldn't be Jerry Lee Lewis if he had lived his
life differently.''    Lewis, the first cousin and boyhood companion of
TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, quit school at 16 and briefly tried preaching
and selling sewing machines before focusing on rock 'n' roll.    He has
had six wives. His fourth wife, Jaren, drowned in a swimming pool in 1982
while suing for divorce; his fifth wife, Shawn, 23 years his junior, died
of an apparent drug overdose in 1983. Within a year, Lewis married his
sixth wife, Kerrie, 21, who filed for divorce in 1986, accusing him of
roughing her up and infidelity. Lewis countersued, but both petitions were
dropped. The Lewises live with their 2-year-old son, Jerry Lee III, near
Nesbit, Miss.    Lewis has bounced in and out of courtrooms throughout
his life, suing or being sued over busted concert dates, troubled romances
and other entanglements.    He also has a history of alcohol and drug
abuse, and in 1986, according to a former road manager, checked himself
out of a detox program because he didn't like making his own bed.    In
1976, Lewis was detained by police after ramming his Lincoln Continental
into the front gates of Presley's Memphis residence, Graceland, while armed
with a .38-caliber pistol. Admitting he had been drinking heavily, Lewis
told police he was called to Graceland because Presley was depressed and
wanted to talk.    Presley never commented publicly on the gate-ramming
escapade, but Shilling, who was a member of Presley's entourage for 11
years, said the two performers were never close friends.    ``You don't
call Jerry Lee if you're depressed,'' Schilling said.    The son of a
one-time bootlegger, Lewis was born in Ferriday, La., and taught himself
to play the piano as a child. His early plans were to become a piano-playing
preacher, and he gave a brief try at attending a fundamentalist bible college
in Texas following his first marriage, at age 16.    Lewis' third marriage,
to Myra, set off cries from parents across the country that it was irrefutable
evidence of the dangers of rock 'n' roll. But marrying young was nothing
new to Lewis' family. His sister Frankie Lee married at 12, and Gail, who
has been married seven times, first wed at 14.    ``I think we're oversexed,''
said Gail Stefanow, who toured as a backup singer with her brother for
15 years.    Lewis has been fighting the IRS for more than a decade. He
went to trial for tax evasion in 1984 and was acquitted, but the government
said he still owed more than $650,000.    In fighting the tax charges,
Lewis' lawyer presented his client as an uneducated country boy overwhelmed
by trying to keep up with the thousands of dollars he was making, much
of it paid in cash. The government said $31,000 was found stuffed in a
paper bag at the singer's Mississippi home, and a former girlfriend said
Lewis once gave her $80,000 in a shoe box to keep for him while he was
hospitalized.    Lewis nearly died from a ruptured stomach in 1981 and
has since had much of his stomach removed. He still gets out from time
to time for late-night drinks at his favorite bars, but is becoming more
of a homebody since the birth of his new son.    Lewis' first son, Jerry
Lee Jr., was killed in a traffic accident at age 19. Aother son, Steve
Allen, drowned in a swimming pool at age 3. He also has two daughters.
   Lewis acknowledged that many of the lumps and bumps in his life may
have been of his own doing, but he stopped short of offering any apology.
   ``I don't think I overshot my runway,'' he said. ``I'm still rockin',
brother ... and I did it my way.''

<TEXT>
   Early in 1988, a letter composed by four Israeli
writers appeared in The New York Times urging American Jews to speak
out against Israel's violent crackdown of Palestinian protesters in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   One of the writers was A.B. Yehoshua, whose novels include ``A
Late Divorce'' and the recently released ``Five Seasons''
(Doubleday, $19.95). Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Yehuda Amichai and other
Israeli writers uphold a tradition of active participation in their
country's politics. Zionism, or Jewish statehood, they note, was
created by a writer _ Theodor Herzl.
   ``The main figures of the first Zionist congress were writers,''
said Yehoshua, professor of literature at Haifa University. ``By
their imagination they understood what was going to happen to the
Jewish people.''
   Avraham Bulli Yehoshua was born in Jerusalem in 1936 at a time
when the city was part of British-controlled Palestine. When he was
12 years old, Israel was granted independence and won a fierce war
with Arabs for possession of the land.
   ``I remember always sitting under the shelters and being without
food. I remember the fighting, the shelling, the bullets. I was
worried about my father, who was working in the secret service,
listening to the Arabs' telephone calls,'' he said.
   He didn't originally want to be a writer, dreaming instead about
a legal career. But as a teen-ager, Yehoshua joined a youth group
and impressed his peers with humorous pieces about local events. He
continued to write while serving in the army.
   ``I was writing about things in the unit _ creating absurd
situations in a very fantastic kind of style, describing what was
inside the camp. This was the idea: absurd stories, fantastic
stories.''
   His first published work, a short story about a dying man, was
also an absurdist piece.
   ``He's still alive but the old woman decides to bury him alive,
to get rid of him,'' Yehoshua said about the work. ``The neighbors
are participating in this live burial, and I'm writing about how
this can be achieved.''
   Yehoshua soon became influenced by the works of William Faulkner,
admiring the great Southern writer's stream-of-consciousness prose
and blending of myth and reality.
   The use of myth is important for an Israeli writer. ``We don't
have a long history as an independent country so you have to relate
yourself to some myth,'' Yehoshua said. ``Israel has changed so
radically it's unbelieveable.''
   A self-described ``dove'' who favors talks between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization and eventual Palestinian
self-determination, recalled a short story he had written in 1962:
   ``A student is sent to a forest because he didn't finish his
studies and his friends are advising him to finish his thesis. So
he's sent to a forest. There's an Arab in the distance planning to
set fire to the forest because it was built on his village. Finally,
the forest is set on fire.
   ``In 1962, it was an indication that the Palestinian problem was
being repressed. The Palestinian problem has been coming, expecially
in the last year. It's a sign that the Israelis have to realize the
limits of Zionism.''
   Politics are not mentioned directly in ``Five Seasons,'' which
chronicles the difficulties of a middle-aged government bureaucrat,
Molkho, in adjusting to the death of his wife, who succumbs to
cancer at the start of the novel.
   Molkho anxiously seeks companionship, flying to Berlin for a
weekend with the legal adviser from work, and spending time with the
wife of his old youth group counselor, who has encouraged the
meeting. But Molkho is unable to connect with either woman, as the
grief over his late wife makes him alternately abrupt and distant,
incapable of understanding their feelings.
   ``My point in this book is that this was the year Molkho thinks
he'll be free,'' Yehoshua said. ``Without believing in ghosts he
interiorizes his wife in such a way that she's still alive after her
death. And this is the way he has to struggle until then he's
liberated.''
   Where ``A Late Divorce'' showed Faulkner's unmistakable
influence, Yehoshua's writing in ``Five Seasons'' is in keeping with
his main character: restrained, introverted and obsessed with minor
details.
   ``It had to be much more subtle,'' the author said. ``When you
are writing stream-of-consciousness, everything has to get out. With
this, there's what you say and what you don't say. There's a gap
between the two. In a way, I was returning to the style of my short
stories.''
   In one passage, Yehoshua describes Molkho's thoughts while
attending a dinner party given by the legal adviser:
   ``The conversation rambled intimately. Though he had prepared a
few subjects to talk about, especially several of a legal nature, he
saw at once that he needn't make the effort, for everyone appeared
harmoniously acquainted and he, it seemed, was passed back and forth
among them in a discreet and unaffected fashion.
   ``Afraid of being suspected of some organic problem if he went to
the toilet too soon, he sat with his legs together to ease the
pressure on his bladder while one by one the men came up to him,
introducing themselves once again ...''
   Yehoshua is a strong critic of the diaspora, the dispersion of
Jews around the world, stating that the failure of Jewish people to
return to their homeland presents a greater threat than the Arabs to
Israel's national security. Yet in the final chapter of ``Five
Seasons,'' Molkho helps an unhappy Russian-born girl return to her
home country.
   ``It was a healthy thing for her to do,'' Yehoshua explained. ``I
don't tell you to stay. You have to feel natural. By understanding
the Russian's feelings, Molkho can better understand himself and
demonstrate his belonging to the country.''

   Homeowners increasingly have been refinancing
their mortgages as interest rates drop and adjustable-rate home
loans lose some of their luster, according to those in the industry.
   ``We're seeing a rash of these variable rate loans coming for
refinancing to a fixed rate, even some where their current (ARM)
rate is lower,'' said Angelo Mozilo, president of Countrywide
Funding Corp. in Pasadena, Calif., one of the nation's largest
mortgage lending companies.
   ``(And) we're getting inquiries by the thousands,'' he said
Monday.
   Mortgage rates, particularly on conventional fixed-rate loans,
have declined steadily in recent weeks as market interest rates
dropped amid continued signs the economy and inflation are cooling.
   In the past month, more and more lenders have dropped their
30-year conventional mortgage rates to below 10 percent for the
first time in about 16 months.
   HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage reserach firm, said
10.5 percent of the 2,000 mortgage lenders surveyed last week
dropped their fixed rates to 9 percent to 9.9 percent, compared with
about two dozen at the end of May.
   The national average for 30-year loans was 10.3 percent, while
the average for one-year ARMs was 9 percent, the survey said.
   Some lenders say the drop in interest rates has helped spur
interest in new and existing homes lately.
   The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that
existing home sales fell 5.6 percent to their lowest level in 16
months. However, some experts predicted the pace would pick up this
summer as the full impact of the rate drop was felt.
   Right now, ARM holders with rates in the 11 percent to 14 percent
range have become the first to cash in on the rate decline by
rushing to lock in lower, fixed rates, industry experts said.
   ARMs are adjusted up or down at specified intervals to reflect
prevailing interest rates, usually one-year Treasury bills. In many
cases, ARM rates may be raised by up to 2 percentage points a year,
or 6 percentage points over the life of the loan.
   For someone who received a $100,000 ARM three years ago with a
7.5 percent rate the first year of the loan, monthly payments would
total $902.78. But payments could rise to $1,361.11 a month this
year, if the rate rose to the maximum 13.5 percent.
   Experts say homeowners should consider refinancing if prevailing
market rates fall at least two percentage points below their
mortgage rate. Otherwise, with closing costs running anywhere from 3
to 5 percentage points of the refinanced loan, it may not be worth
it, they said.
   The rush to refinance appears to be spotty, according to experts.
   Fred Koons, chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp.'s home mortgage
division, said he's seen a sharp increase in refinancings in
California, where ARMs are particularly popular. He said half of the
current mortgage applications there were for refinancings.
   But Ronnie J. Wynn, president of Colonial Mortgage Co. of
Montgomery, Ala., said refinancings made up only 1.5 percent of
outstanding mortgages, compared with 40 percent in 1986 and 1987,
when interest rates were significantly lower.
   ``Refinancings are up a little bit but most of the people who had
interest rates of 12 percent or above, where it would be worthwhile
to refinance, refinanced in '86 or '87,'' Wynn said. ``I do think
we'll see them (refinancings) pick up as interest rates fall.''
   For homeowners with ARMs that started out with low interest rates
the first year but headed higher each year as overall interest rates
rose, refinanicng means more than securing a steady rate.
   ``It's brought peace of mind for some people,'' said Mozilo of
Countrywide, where 10 percent of the $800 million are loan
applications are for refinancings. ``Many people were very naive to
the consequences of these adjustable rate mortgages. Of course, many
people also couldn't qualify to buy a home without ARMs.''

   A new generation of supersonic jetliners
might be built, but only if manufacturers can conquer the immense
environmental, technical and economic problems of a plane that would
fly at twice the speed of sound while costing twice as much as a
747, a Boeing Co. official says.
   ``This is Boeing dreaming,'' said Michael Henderson, manager of
High-Speed Commercial Transport studies for Boeing. ``But it's our
job in new airplane development to protect the future of the company.
   About 70 Boeing employees has been looking at whether a new
supersonic transport could be flying within the next 20 years. The
early outlook, Henderson said Monday, is that it could be done, but
not easily.
   Henderson said that McDonnell Douglas Corp. _ the only other U.S.
maker of commercial jets _ the Europeans and the Japanese also have
looked at new-generation SSTs, and appear to have reached similar
conclusions.
   ``We and Boeing have been working on parallel paths,'' said
McDonnell Douglas spokesman Keith Takahashi in Long Beach, Calif.
   Boeing and McDonnell Douglas each received $4.5 million from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a two-year study
on the feasibility of a new SST. Both companies decided to continue
the research after the study ended last fall.
   Boeing declined to say how much it has spent so far.
   Boeing pinned a lot of hopes and a lot of money in the late 1960s
on building an SST. When the government cancelled the program over
environmental concerns, it contributed to the Boeing slump that
plunged Seattle, its headquarters city, into hard times in the early
1970s.
   Because of this, Boeing executives have said they are wary of
committing the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take to
build a new SST.
   Richard Albrecht, executive vice president of Boeing's Commercial
Airplanes division, has said that while the Concorde SST has been
successful as a premium trans-Atlantic service, he doubts anyone
would build _ nor would airlines buy _ a plane that must command a
much higher ticket price to serve a niche market.
   The Anglo-French Concorde began flying passengers in 1976. Only
about a dozen of the sleek jets now fly, operated by Air France and
British Airways, and are severely limited in routes because of noisy
engines and ear-rattling sonic boom resulting from it flying about
twice the speed of sound.
   Boeing is studying a plane capable of flying 1.8 to 2.5 times the
speed of sound, or roughly 1,330 to 1,850 mph. That would permit it
to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo in 4 hours 20 minutes, compared
with the 10 hours, 20 minutes a non-stop subsonic flight takes today.
   Boeing doubts a faster plane would be practical, because it would
require new fuels such as liquid natural gas or liquid hydrogen, and
special airport facilities, Henderson said. Further, a plane that
could fly 2,500 mph or better would have scant time at cruising
speed on a 5,000-mile trans-Pacific flight.
   Boeing's four-engine HSCT, a long, languid curve in profile, is
envisioned to be about 293 feet long, 60 feet longer than a 747-400
jumbo jet, with a wingspan of just 142 feet, or 70 feet less than
the 747-400. It would haul 200 to 300 passengers about 5,000
nautical miles non-stop.
   The Concorde is about 204 feet long with an 84-foot wingspan and
carries 100 to 128 passengers 3,360 nautical miles non-stop.
   By using engine noise suppressors, Boeing planners think their
HSCT could meet the government's strict new standards for airport
noise. Sonic boom is another matter.
   ``We saw no way and still see no way we could reduce sonic boom
to acceptable levels over land,'' Henderson said.
   Another environmental worry is possible damage to the ozone
layer. By limiting the plane to under Mach 3, or three times the
speed of sound, it could still fly below the ozone layer, in the
troposphere, where engine emissions should be dispersed, Henderson
said.
   The HSCT would require some yet-to-be developed technology,
especially in lightweight composite materials. Just as critical is
making the plane economical to fly, he said.
   Boeing estimates air traffic in 2015 will be about 1.9 million
passenger miles per day, roughly twice what it is now. About a third
of all passengers would be on routes that could be served by an
HSCT, Henderson said.
   The problem, he said, is that to compete, an HSCT has to offer a
ticket price roughly the same as the newer and cheaper-to-operate
long-range widebody jets. That could be tough, he said, for a plane
that probably would cost twice as much as a 747-400, which sells for
about $125 million.
   In Boeing's market research, ``even an optimistic look says that
if you were to increase the ticket prices by as much as 20 percent,
we'd lose over half the market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Time Rejects Sweetened Paramount Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. has rejected Paramount Communications
Inc.'s $12.2 billion takeover bid, noting that the sweetened offer
is subject to the same unresolved conditions as Paramount's earlier
$10.7 billion proposal.
   Time's board, which turned down the revised $200-a-share bid
Monday, also called the offer financially inadequate, and the media
giant restated its intention to pursue a $14 billion tender offer of
its own for Warner Communications Inc.
   ``The Paramount offer remains as highly conditional and
conjectural as it was when Paramount started it nearly three weeks
ago,'' Time said in a statement Monday.
   Paramount has conditioned its buyout on being able to obtain
financing for the deal _ which it did not accomplish while its
earlier $175-a-share bid was on the table _ and on obtaining the
rights to operate about 800 cable television systems Time owns. The
bid is also contingent upon the termination of Time's merger
agreement with Warner.
   Time, which has focused on these conditions in its campaign
against Paramount, claims they will prevent the Paramount bid from
being completed and has urged its shareholders not to be tempted by
the size of the offer.
   ``It's not just the question of price,'' Time Vice Chairman Jerry
Levin said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Paramount was undaunted by the latest rejection. ``We will
continue to pursue our acquisition of Time in a calm, studied and
deliberate manner,'' it said in a statement.
   Time announced its rejection of the Paramount bid after the close
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Time stock seesawed in nervous trading as investors awaited the
board's response, rising as high as $172.25 a share before closing
at $164 a share, down $1.87{ from Friday's close.
   Securities analysts had expected Time to reject any sweetened bid.
   However, observers said they did not expect Paramount to raise
its offer again and Levin indicated the company expected the
takeover struggle to be resolved in Delaware Chancery Court, where
Paramount has sued to block Time's planned $70-a-share buyout of
Warner.
   A key issue before the court in Delaware _ where all three
companies are incorporated _ is whether Time put itself up for sale,
thereby opening itself up to the bid from Paramount, when it
announced its merger agreement with Warner in March.
   Time and Warner originally agreed to merge in a stock-for-stock
transaction but revised their merger agreement to provide for Time's
tender offer after Paramount announced its first bid on June 6.
   Paramount contends that Time's tender offer for Warner was begun
solely as a defense against the Paramount bid.
   ``I just believe that when the court looks at these issues, that
there's a fairly persuasive case that we have a transaction that has
not been done defensively...'' Levin said. ``It's something we've
studied for so long.''
   When they announced their plans to merge, Time and Warner said
they had been negotiating over two years.
   Time stated that its board based its unanimous rejection of the
Paramount bid partly on the opinions of its financial advisers,
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., that the
offer was inadequate.
   ``Paramount's original offer of $175 was absurdly low,'' Time
Chairman J. Richard Munro stated. ``Paramount's revised offer has
not changed the conclusion of our management and board that the
acquisition of Warner by Time is in the best interests of Time and
its stockholders.''
   Meanwhile, speculation continued on Wall Street that Paramount
itself might be the target of a hostile bid. Investors bid Paramount
stock up $2.37{ a share to $60.37{ Monday.
   Warner stock was up 25 cents a share to $58.87{.
   Also Monday, two large Time shareholders, Robert M. Bass Limited
Partners and a partnership of the Cablevision Systems Corp. and
Jerry Perenchio, filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to
block Time's annual meeting, scheduled for Friday.
   Bass and the Cablevision-Perenchio group have been mentioned as
possible bidders for some of Time's assets, The New York Times
reported in Tuesday's editions.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in quiet, early European
trading today, and foreign currency dealers said the market was
waiting for cues from economic news to be released this week.
   Gold prices fell.
   ``The dollar is completely flat today,'' said one trader in
Milan, Italy.
   He said investors were uncertain about where to go and were
waiting for Thursday's release of U.S. leading economic indicators
and for the outcome of the West German central bank's policy meeting
the same day.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 141.23 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 141.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.9558 West German marks, up from 1.9552; 1.6840
Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.6343 French francs, down from 6.6380;
2.2045 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2003; 1,415.55 Italian lire, up
from 1,414.00; and 1.1943 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19405.
   The dollar fell slightly against the British pound in London. It
cost $1.5495 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5450 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $374.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $375.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $373.55.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.85, down from $374.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.15 to close at a bid of
$375.11.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.29 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $5.33.

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index plunged.
   The dollar closed at 141.23 yen, up 1.05 yen from Monday's close

yen and 141.30 yen.
   The dollar had fallen 4.77 yen in three trading days before
today's rebound.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader at Daiwa Bank, said the rebound
mainly reflected position adjustments.
   ``Nothing happened today,'' he added. ``There were no buying
incentives, there were no releases of major economic indicators this
week, there was no central bank intervention _ nothing.''
   Kinugasa said, ``The yen's sharp rebound last week has come to a
halt, and the majority of investors are now avoiding major moves
until they find a new trend in the market.''
   The dollar had risen to a nearly two-year high closing of 151.30
on June 15 before heading back down.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
156.61 points, or 0.47 percent, closing at 33,469.21. The market's
main barometer had gained 95.11 points Monday.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities, said the
index fell mainly because of the yen's decline against the dollar
and the governing Liberal Democratic Party's loss in a parliamentary
by-election on Sunday.
   ``Japanese investors were reluctant to buy issues because of
uncertainties over the direction of the foreign exchange and
pessimism over performance in the upper house election,'' he said.
Elections for half the seats in the upper house are scheduled for
July 23.
   Other dealers said speculative investors sold spot issues for
arbitrage deals between the spot and the futures markets, prompting
the Nikkei's fall in the afternoon session.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500
million shares, up from Monday's 430 million.

   Eastern Airlines and its pilots' union are
negotiating under court supervision over the strike-bound company's
attempt to cancel the pilots' contract and impose wage concessions.
   The Air Line Pilots Association and Eastern were to meet for a
second day today after Monday's first session ordered by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland produced ``nothing fruitful,''
said a union spokesman.
   The meeting was the first between Eastern and ALPA since the
airline last week sought court permission to cancel its contract
with the pilots. The two sides met at the offices of David I.
Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing the airline on
behalf of the bankruptcy court.
   ALPA spokesman Dan Ashby said Monday's meeting was mainly a
``feeling-out process, a discussion of basic issues.'' Eastern
declined comment.
   Other ALPA officials said they did not expect Eastern to offer
the job-security provisions the union says would be necessary for an
agreement.
   Most of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants have been honoring
the pickets of the International Association of Machinists since the
machinists began their strike March 4, forcing the carrier to
sharply cut back the number of its flights.
   A House subcommittee plans this week to examine the impact of the
nearly four-month-old strike and a Senate panel has asked the
General Accounting Office to assess the impact of Eastern's proposed
reorganization on the airline industry.
   Six senators also are asking Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner to block Eastern, at least temporarily, from selling more
assets as part of the airline's reorganization plan.
   Eastern last week asked the bankruptcy judge for permission to
impose about $50 million in wage and benefit concessions, as well as
changes in work policies that would allow Eastern to increase
pilots' hours.
   Eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as
part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protections as a smaller carrier.
   A consultant to the pilots' union said over the weekend that
Shapiro would oppose Eastern's bid to terminate the contract.
Shapiro did not return calls seeking comment Monday and Eastern said
it wasn't aware of Shapiro's position.
   The unions contend Eastern and its parent company, Texas Air
Corp., are trying to use the bankruptcy court to destroy Eastern's
unions.
   Lifland would have to approve Eastern's reorganization plan,
which includes major asset sales. The unions have unsuccessfully
sought the sale of Eastern.
   Lifland said three weeks ago the court would no longer consider
the buyout offer of Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie,
although he said Ritchie was free to pursue his offer with Eastern.
   On Capitol Hill, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation has requested the GAO investigation, saying in a
letter that its review ``should examine whether the proposed
business plan of Eastern has any realistic prospect of revitalizing
the carrier.''
   In a separate letter to Skinner, six senators called on the
transportation secretary to ``seek a delay in additional sales that
could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry.''
   The senators specifically cited Eastern's reported plan to sell
its South American routes.
   The senators who wrote to Skinner were Democrats Frank R.
Lautenberg of New Jersey, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, Bob Graham of
Florida, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.

   The stock market rose in early trading today,
bouncing back from Monday's round of selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 12.71 to 2,524.09
in the first 30 minutes of trading.
   Gainers outnumbers losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 576 up, 343 down and
517 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.58 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   The early gains indicated the impact of Monday's more than
20-point decline in the Dow industrials may have waned. But there
was little economic news or other factors that appeared to be
driving the market early today.
   The stock market advanced last week to new highs following the
1987 crash amid gathering signs of a slowing economy. The Dow Jones
industrials average gained 66 points on Thursday and Friday alone.
   A slowdown today also was attributed to waning support from
``window dressing'' by money managers at investing institutions, who
were readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
182.94, up 0.74 at 10 a.m.
   Among gainers, Eastman Kodak was up 1] to 49{, United Airlines
jumped 3 to 142\, British Telecommunications gained ~ to 42} and
Chevron was up | at 53{ in early trading.
   Time, which Monday rejected a $200-a-share buyout offer from
Paramount Communications, was up 1 at 164. Paramount was unchanged
at 60].
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.49 to
2,511.38.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by nearly 4 to 3 on the NYSE,
with 629 up, 825 down and 494 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 143.60 million shares, against 198.72
million in the previous session.

   European Economic Community leaders today
agreed on a compromise plan for gradually unifying their economies
after Britain succeeded in blocking attempts to create a single
currency and a central bank.
   ``We have conceded nothing at all,'' British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said at the end of a two-day summit.
   However, France and West Germany, which were aligned against
Britain in the dispute over broad plans to unify the economies, also
declared themselves pleased with the compromise pact.
   Closer monetary union is part of the EEC's drive toward December
1992, when the member nations will drop trade barriers to form a
single market.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the agreement at the end
of a two-day EEC summit was a ``superb result.
   ``The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the
EEC further together and brings political union one step nearer,''
Kohl told reporters.
   The 12 EEC leaders have been divided over how far and how fast to
go toward closer economic and monetary union as part of the
establishment of a single Europe-wide market in 1992.
   In a final communique, the leaders endorsed only part of a
sweeping plan for monetary union drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of
the EEC's executive body, the European Commission.
   The communique avoided setting any deadline on the more
controversial aspects of the plan: creating a single currency and a
central bank. But it did provide for the calling of the
intergovernmental conference on those proposals, something Mrs.
Thatcher had sought to avoid.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said he would call an
intergovernmental conference after next year. The conference can be
called by a simple majority, but once there any member nation could
then veto the changes.
   Britain also agreed in principle to link the pound to the
exchange rate mechanism that aligns the value of the EEC's major
currencies.
   But Mrs. Thatcher hedged the move, which she has long resisted,
with strict conditions. These included that Britain's 8.3 percent
inflation must drop to near the 4.5 percent average in the EEC and
that arrangements for the single market must be complete.
   Besides Britain, some smaller EEC nations, including The
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Portugal, have also expressed
reservations about the Delors plan.
   Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher clashed repeatedly during the summit
behind closed doors, officials reported, and jibed publicly at each
other afterward.
   Each claimed that it was the other who was the other who had been
most isolated at the conference.
   ``It was not me who was isolated,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``It was
President Mitterrand.''
   Mitterrand agreed with a French radio interviewer that Mrs.
Thatcher was the ``brake'' on Europe.
   She retorted at a news conference, ``Its a bit rich, isn't it _
someone who has not got freedom of capital movement ... calling me a
brake on Europe. He has scarcely got into the car.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, adopting a more conciliatory manner than usual at
this summit, agreed Monday to support in principle the linking of
the British pound to a system that aligns the major EEC currencies.
   Mrs. Thatcher rejects full monetary integration as surrendering
to the EEC national policy-making powers on budgetary and other
financial matters.
   Mitterrand conference said he was ``very satisfied'' with the
summit.
   Asked if he was angry about Mrs. Thatcher's resistance to the
Delors plan, which he strongly favored, he said, ``One should not
confuse a certain firmness with anger.'' He added smiling, ``I am
used to her ... she's very nice.''

<HEAD>May Department Stores Considers Sale of Discounters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. today said it is
exploring the possibility of selling its Caldor and Venture
subsidiaries, the company's discount segment.
   David C. Farrell, May chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company has asked the investment banking firm Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. Inc. to look into the possible sales.
   ``The divestiture of Caldor and Venture will allow May to focus
on the operations and expansion of our higher-return and
faster-growing businesses, department stores and specialty shoe
stores,'' Farrell said.
   Farrell said that with the additions last year of Foley's and
Filene's, two department store chains, May's 14 department store
divisions produced sales of $7.5 billion and operating earnings of
$802 million. Volume Shoe's sales were $1.1 billion with operating
earnings of $138 million.
   Caldor's sales for 1988 came to $1.6 billion with earnings of $50
million and Venture's sales amounted to $1.3 billion with earnings
of $81 million.
   May said it anticipates using a significant portion of any
proceeds from the divestiture to buy back its stock, depending on
market conditions and other factors. The company said it would use
the balance of any proceeds for general corporate purposes,
including expansion of its department store and specialty shoe
businesses.
   May is one of the largest retailers in the United States. It
currently operates 283 department stores in 29 states and the
District of Columbia, 120 Caldor stores in eight states in the
Northeast, 73 Venture stores in the Midwest and 2,628 Volume Shoe
stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Improves Dramatically</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6 percent increase in exports helped Britain's
merchandise trade deficit narrow more sharply than expected to 1.72
billion pounds in May, the government said Tuesday.
   The figures provided some evidence that the government's strategy
of cooling the economy with high interest rates was working. The
numbers raised hopes that interest rates, which stand at 14 percent,
won't be pushed higher again.
   The British pound and stock prices rose after the figures were
announced.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a shortfall of 2.16
billion pounds, or $3.35 billion, in April, the Department of Trade
and Industry said.
   The current account deficit shrank to 1.32 billion pounds from
1.76 billion pounds.
   The current account includes invisible trade such as overseas
investment earnings. Invisible trade was estimated to be in surplus
by 400 million pounds.
   The figures compared with market expectations of a merchandise
trade gap of 2.1 billion pounds and a current account deficit of 1.6
billion pounds.
   Exports totaled 7.58 billion pounds, up from 7.14 billion pounds.
The department attributed 243 million pounds of the rise to aircraft
deals.
   Imports were flat at 9.3 billion pounds.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade deficit
has grown to 9.74 billion pounds compared with a deficit of 7.06
billion pounds a year earlier.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade although
there was little fresh news of interest to the markets.
   The modest advance in corn and soybean prices suggested those
markets had already discounted the beneficial effects of overnight
rains in the Midwest and that some traders viewed Monday's steep
losses as excessive.
   Wheat prices continued a rally begun Monday on talk of a
significant Soviet purchase of U.S. wheat.
   The Agriculture Department issued its weekly crop update after
the close of trading Monday, rating the U.S. corn and soybean crops
in mostly fair to good condition as of Sunday.
   The USDA said most spring wheat was in good shape and winter
wheat harvesting was about 25 percent complete, compared to 49
percent on the same date last year.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.05{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 2 cents higher with July at $2.59 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1{ cents higher with July at $1.49} a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 3 cents higher with July at $7.31 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were moderately lower and most pork futures were
down sharply in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .47 cent lower with August at 70.30
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with
August at 81.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent to .77 cent
lower with July at 49.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1

<HEAD>Baker Proposes Asian Trade Alliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
proposed establishing an Asian trade alliance involving the United
States and the emerging economic powers of the Pacific Rim.
   Although he didn't provide a detailed blueprint, Baker told a
black-tie dinner of the Asia Society, a non-profit group, late
Monday his plan would focus on coordinating the region's trade and
economic policies.
   He said the new alliance should also focus on other issues
ranging from cultural affairs to the environment.
   Baker said he plans to seek input on the plan during a trip to
Asia that starts July 3.
   Baker will stop in Tokyo to help plan multinational economic aid
for the Philippines. In Brunei, he will attend the annual meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, an economic organization
of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
   Intra-Asian trade last year totaled nearly $200 billion,
reflecting the rapid pace of Pacific Rim economic integration, Baker
said.
   ``Yet unlike Europe,'' he said, ``there are inadequate regional
mechanisms to deal with the effects of interdependence.''
   Japan's new foreign minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who met with
President Bush earlier Monday, spoke at the Asia Society dinner
before Baker. He stressed the need for America ``to maintain a
strong political, economic and military presence and commitment to
the region.''
   If a Pacific Rim group could be established it would ensure the
United States a stronger role in the region and provide a forum for
working out nagging trade problems.
   On China, Baker defended Bush's cautious response to the brutal
crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators, saying it would be a
mistake to dismantle the relationship the United States built up
over two decades with the Communist government in Beijing.

   Recognition Equipment Inc., battling federal
bid-rigging charges, on Tuesday rejected a $78 million takeover bid
by a New York investment firm, but said the company is in
``preliminary stages of negotiation'' with several other suitors.
   REI's board said the $11-per-share offer by The Prospect Group
Inc. was ``coercive, inadequate and not in the best interests of the
company and its stockholders.''
   Chairman Tom Ringer, who took over after former chairman William
G. Moore Jr. was indicted on bid-rigging charges, said REI is
looking for buyers as well as considering pursuing ``management's
long-term business plan.''
   Dallas-based REI makes document management systems, including
automated mail sorters. Prospect Chairman W. Wallace McDowell has
said the buyout would enable REI to regain U.S. Postal Service
contracts it has been blocked from bidding on because of the
indictment.
   A spokesman for Prospect said the company would have no immediate
comment on the REI rejection of Prospect's June 14 offer, which was
its second bid in six months to buy the company.
   REI, Moore and former Vice President Robert W. Reedy have been
indicted on charges they conspired to rig a bid to obtain a
multimillion-dollar contract from the Postal Service for
mail-sorting equipment.
   The indictment led to REI being banned from bidding on Postal
Service and U.S. Army contracts. The Army ban has since been lifted,
but the Postal Service exclusion remains in effect.
   McDowell and Reedy resigned as officers, but remain as employees,
although they are on a leave of absence. Trial on the charges
currently is scheduled for September in Washington, D.C.

   UAL Corp.'s stock soared more than $7 a share this
morning on speculation that the parent of United Airlines may become
a takeover target.
   The buying surge apparently was prompted by a report in USA Today
that an investment group headed by Texas billionaire Robert Bass had
acquired 2.5 percent to 3 percent of UAL's stock.
   Susan Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Bass, declined comment on the
report. UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company would not comment
on the stock activity.
   At noon EDT on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock was
trading at $146.50 a share, up $7.25 from Monday's close. The jump
followed gains of $1.75 on Monday and $15.50 last week.
   Analysts said takeover specialists are eyeing airline companies
following an investor group's successful $3.6 billion bid last week
for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines.

at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 916 up, 489 down and
516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 125.26 million shares at 2
p.m.
   Traders said the gains indicated the impact of Monday's more than
20-point decline in the Dow industrials had waned.
   Declining interest rates in the bond market and a stronger dollar
also helped propel stocks higher, analysts said.
   ``I think the market is finding a trading range here,'' said
Eugene Peroni, director of technical research for Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc. ``There seems to be good buying interest today.''
   The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid
gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators
that inflation would not accelerate. That would be positive news for
corporate earnings.
   The Dow Jones industrials average gained 66 points on Thursday
and Friday alone.
   Today's gains also were attributed to institutions who are
completing their second-quarter trading ahead of the July 4 weekend
to prepare midyear portfolio reports for clients.
   UAL was up 8{ to 147}\ on unconfirmed reports that Texas investor
Robert Bass was part of a group that had acquired a stake in the

   Share prices ended sharply higher on the London
Stock Exchange Tuesday as recent fears of a rise in British interest
rates were soothed by a surprising narrowing of the British trade
deficit in May.
   Adding further momentum to the market's rise were strong gains in
early Wall Street trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 26.8
points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,206.4, just 1.1 points below its
peak. It was the first time the key index closed above 2,200 points
in more than five weeks.
   At its lowest, the index was down 5.8 points at late morning, as
players anxiously waited for the release of the May trade report.
   Volume accelerated to a moderate 498.2 million shares from 369.9
million shares on Monday.
   Share prices took their cue from the British pound, which rallied
on the strength of the trade report and on news that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher had reached an agreement on plans for monetary
union with other European leaders meeting in Madrid, Spain.
   ``Anything at the moment that is good news for sterling is good
news for interest rates, which is good news for the (equity)
market,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 20.4 points at 1,829.7.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 11.27 points to 1,249.56.

   A federal judge today ordered nearly
43,000 coal miners in nine states to end a wildcat strike and go
back to work.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp issued the indefinite
restraining order against the United Mine Workers at the request of
the National Labor Relations Board.
   The nearly 43,000 miners walked out in support of 1,900 UMW
members who have been on strike against Pittston Coal Group since
April 5.
   UMW Vice President Joe Corcoran in Washington did not immediately
return a telephone call.
   Miners have ignored previous restraining orders and remained off
the job.
   Knapp said union officials must report to the NLRB within 10 days
on what steps they have taken to meet the court order.
   The judge could have restricted the back-to-work order to West
Virginia and parts of Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, but instead made
it nationwide, ordering that it apply to all coal companies with
whom the UMW has contracts.
   About 1,600 UMW miners in Virginia and West Virginia went on
strike against Pittston on April 5 after working 14 months without a
contract. They were joined by 300 Pittston miners in Kentucky
earlier this month.
   That strike spurred wildcat sympathy walkouts beginning June 12
in Appalachia and the Midwest. At one point, 46,000 miners in
Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia were off the job. Missouri's
miners went back to work on Monday.
   Most of the nation's union miners began their two-week vacations
this week, and the coal fields have been relatively quiet since the
weekend.
   On Monday, a second attempt by Gov. Gaston Caperton to mediate in
the 11-week-old Pittston walkout fell short when Pittston Chairman
Paul Douglas declined to say whether he would meet with UMW
President Richard Trumka.
   Caperton had invited Douglas and Trumka last week to meet at the
governor's mansion.
   But Caperton attached several conditions unacceptable to Douglas,
including asking that Pittston not use other coal companies to fill
its orders and that other companies suspend any lawsuits against the
UMW over the strikes.
   The governor's latest offer contained no conditions.

   There are more than balmy breezes
blowing from the south.
   Hundreds of sweet-talking scam operators are working the
telephones to con victims out of a few hundred dollars or, in some
cases, their life savings.
   Investigators estimate 90 percent of all the major ``boiler
room'' telemarketing schemes in the nation are based in either South
Florida or Southern California, with affluent Orange County, Calif.,
dethroning Fort Lauderdale several years ago as the country's scam
capital.
   The pitches are limited only by the imagination _ from oil wells
to medical breakthroughs; worm ranches to low-cost precious metals _
and rope in nearly $1 billion annually, according to the Federal
Trade Commission.
   Officials say the best salesmen can mold a lump of truth into a
monument of credibility and disguise a sham as a once-in-a-lifetime
deal.
   ``These boiler room guys like life in the fast lane: the yachts,
the fancy cars, the sunshine,'' said Kent Neal, head of the Broward
County Economic Crime Unit based in Fort Lauderdale. ``South Florida
and Southern California offer the kind of lifestyle they want.''
   Scam artists also like southern climes for their transient
populations and ready pools of pitchmen.
   ``Some of the ads they run specifically target struggling actors
or musicians,'' said David Katz, coordinator of the Southern
California Fraud Task Force based in Los Angeles. ``In an way, it's
like an acting job. They try to give the pitch as sincerely and
convincingly as possible. Too many times it works.''
   Tougher state laws and more aggressive enforcement have driven
many boiler room operators from the Fort Lauderdale area, but Neal
estimates about 80 large telemarketing fraud operations still carry
on from Miami to Palm Beach. Katz said at least 150 boiler rooms
have staked out Southern California, with most centered around
Newport Beach.
   The boiler room's ability to survive is partially due to lack of
coordination betwen federal and state law enforcement agencies and
the con artists' nomadic instincts, say investigators.
   ``When the law gets too close, they pack up shop and begin
again,'' said Deputy State Attorney Albert Sheldon, a boiler room
specialist based in San Diego.
   The first telephone scams began in South Florida in the 1920s,
when salesmen would pitch mosquito-infested swampland as prime
property. The boiler rooms _ so called for their typically spartan
surroundings _ did not flourish again until the 1970s. This time,
sure-bet oil and gas fields and inexpensive gems and gold dominated
the pitches, said Neal.
   One of Neal's favorite souvenirs from the early '80s heyday of
South Florida boiler rooms is a piece of wood carved and painted to
resemble a gold bar. It was found with others in the vaults of
International Gold Bullion Exchange, one of the boldest and most
notorious fraud scams on record.
   From unusually swank offices in a Fort Lauderdale skyscraper
topped with the IGBE logo, principals William and James Alderdice
reportedly made $75 million on fraudulent sales of gold, silver and
platinum to 13,000 investors, many reassured by IGBE ads in the Wall
Street Journal. Some IGBE salesmen earned $8,000 a week and the
Alderdices were known to toss $100 bills from their stretch
limousine and watch folks scramble for the cash.
   Neal's successful prosecution of IGBE in 1985 was the first major
boiler room case in South Florida and is credited with beginning the
crackdown that drove many to California. William Alderdice was
hacked to death by his chauffeur before the trial began and his
brother received a 10-year federal and a six-year state sentence.
   ``We are an equal opportunity agency. We prosecute anyone. We
have doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs,'' Neal said, pointing to a
photo of Bernard Kabrahrah, a former Comanche tribal leader who
became involved in a $40 million scam to sell rights to
non-producing natural gas wells in Oklahoma.
   And the victims _ known as mooches or mullets in boiler-room
parlance _ are just as varied.
   ``It's no longer just the retirees getting burned. Yuppies with
money to spend are becoming the new targets,'' said Neal.
   Some emerging scams include bogus job search agencies, travel
club rip-offs and touting low-priced ``penny'' stocks, according to
the Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing, a watchdog group. Neal
has also noticed organized crime taking an interest in boiler rooms.
   In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the
nation's largest penny stock dealer, Stuart-James Co. Inc. of
Denver, with defrauding clients at its Boca Raton office by making
exaggerated claims about companies. ``A good boiler room salesman is
like a chameleon,'' said Neal. ``If you are religious, suddenly they
are born-again. If you have kids, they are suddenly the concerned
parent. They tell you what you want to hear.''
   In Southern California, scams involving vitamins and prize
contests are hot, say investigators.
   The boiler rooms hook customers with a postcard saying they have
won a valuable prize _ sometimes cash, a car or jewelry. The catch
is that the customers must also purchase a supply of vitamins or
some other item. Often the vitamins or prize are never delivered or
they are grossly inferior to the product described by the ``yaks,''
or boiler room salesmen.
   Yet local agencies are often slow to crack down, said Katz.
   ``The cops here are dealing with drug traffic, gang violence and
all sorts of other things,'' said Katz, whose office has prosecuted
300 people since 1986.
   Some areas, such as Clark County, Nev., have discouraged boiler
rooms by requiring costly bonds for each company and every employee
of a telemarking firm.
   California began registration of telemarketing firms in January
1987, and operators face a maximum penalty of one year in prison and
a $10,000 fine for failing to comply.
   Florida adopted tough boiler-room laws in October 1986, including
making schemes involving more than $50,000 in losses a first-degree
felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison. In 1987, Gary Fox was
convicted of swindling $11 million from 4,000 investors in his
United Precious Metals firm and was sentenced to 585 years in
prison, believed to be the longest white-collar crime sentence.
   Neal has one letter he can't forget. It came in early 1987 from
Samuel Kaminsky of Hazleton, Pa., who lost $70,000 in mostly
borrowed money in the United Precious Metals scam.
   ``I feel foolish and unable to make decisions. I always feel as
though I will make another devastating mistake,'' wrote Kaminsky.
   ``These letters tear me up,'' said Neal. ``When a guy robs you on
the street at least he is up front and only takes what is in your
pocket. With telemarketing scams, they don't just take what's in
your pocket, but everything else you own. You can make more money,
but it's the emotional impact you may never recover from.''

<HEAD>Mobil, Union Agree on Withdrawal Terms, Union Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp. and the Chemical
Workers Industrial Union reached an agreement Tuesday on most
elements of the oil concern's withdrawal from South Africa, the
union announced.
   Two issues remain to be worked out in meetings next month, but
otherwise the union won most of its demands, the group said in a
statement.
   Mobil spokesman Mike Morgan in New York said the company would
not comment on any possible accord.
   Mobil announced on April 28 that it was withdrawing from the
racially divided nation and selling holdings once valued at $400
million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd., a South African
conglomerate, for more than $155 million in cash and $10 million
that was expected to be the operation's 1989 profit.
   The company, which blamed U.S. foreign policy for forcing the
pullout, said it would record a net book loss of $140 million on the
sale after adjustments for taxes and accounting.
   The chemical workers' union threatened to strike, accusing Mobil
of lying about its intentions to leave and demanding a series of
concessions. The union represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 black
workers.
   Tuesday's agreement honors labor contracts and provides job
security with the new owner as well as details of the disinvestment,
the union said.
   The ``one vital piece of information'' still to be provided, the
union said, was whether Mobil would continue to supply crude oil to
South Africa after Gencor's subsidiary, Trek, takes over Mobil's
assets June 30.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said in April that Mobil would not
export crude or products to South Africa.
   The union said this and details of a trust fund would be
negotiated with a senior U.S. representative from Mobil next month.
   ``The union regards the progress made so far as a major advance
in its campaign for a fair disinvestment procedure. There is still a
considerable way to go but within the constraints of Mobil's failure
to give notice ... progress has been made,'' the union statement
said.
   Mobil had operated in South Africa for 90 years and was the
largest U.S. company doing business there, with almost 2,800
employees.
   Its decision to withdraw followed months of denials that it would
follow Exxon Corp., who left in 1986, and about 170 other American
companies in bowing to pressure to disinvest in South Africa because
of the country's apartheid racial policy.
   Some major oil exporters claim to observe an embargo on doing
business in South Africa, but the absence of any petroleum shortages
has raised questions about whether and how their products are
funneled into the country.
   Militant black unions joined other anti-apartheid groups in
demanding sanctions and disinvestment by foreign companies during
widespread political unrest in 1985 and 1986, but since then have
cooled their public rhetoric on the subject. Critics of the union
position say the pullouts by major firms hurt black workers as well
as hardening the attitudes of whites.
   Mobil said earlier that all contract and equal employment
policies would remain in effect under the new owners and the company
would continue until at least 1994 to fund a foundation that
supports various social programs in South Africa.

   Mongolian cashmere sweaters hang from
Bloomingdale's racks, and General Electric still hopes to sell China
its locomotives, but the $14 billion trade relationship between the
United States and the People's Republic has been damaged after years
of patient nurturing.
   In the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre and subsequent
string of executions, experts point to pockets of vulnerability
among U.S. companies working with China as well as a decline in
Chinese imports.
   ``It won't be because Americans don't want to buy, but delivery
and reliability will be perceived widely as going down, and that
will affect orders irrespective of whether it's true,'' said David
M. Lampton, president of the National Committee on United
States-China Relations.
   China had replaced other Pacific Rim nations as a low-cost
producer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents while
steadily improving productivity and quality as workers became more
motivated.
   ``The problem is going to be whether the work force will continue
to be as productive,'' Lampton said, as Chinese workers and managers
become more fearful of associating with foreigners.
   ``Communications are snarled, we don't know if longshoremen will
load ships on time,'' and American importers just may not want to
deal with those uncertainties, he noted.
   Without Chinese imports, Americans would pay more for Nike
running shoes, silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls.
   Experts say toy and game importers, who already are stocking up
ahead of the Christmas shopping season, are scrambling to line up
suppliers in other low-cost nations like Thailand and Mexico. Last
year China exported $1.17 billion worth of toys and games to the
United States.
   On the flip side, Midwest farmers would take a beating if their
exports were curtailed. Last year they shipped to China about $700
million in wheat, the largest U.S. export to the People's Republic,
according to the Commerce Department.
   Computer makers could lose a $150 million-plus outlet for their
goods.
   Military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of a
presidential decree prohibiting further sales to China. Grumman
Corp. said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associated
with a $500 million U.S. Air Force contract to develop and modernize
a weapons control system for Chinese fighters.
   U.S. companies that sell products like power-generating equipment
to the Chinese goverment could face trouble because China ``is going
to have a foreign exchange shortage,'' said Roger Sullivan,
president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
   ``They've taken a big hit on their balance of payments. They
can't buy what they thought they would buy, and they're going to
have to cut imports,'' he said.
   Roughly 80 percent of U.S. companies' investment in China lies in
industries that manufacture goods for the domestic market, Sullivan
said. Plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly.
   But most U.S. businesses are not likely to suffer substantially.
While they have committed $3.4 billion to joint ventures in China,
each firm's individual exposure is limited.
   General Electric Co., for example, sold $500 million of
locomotives, aircraft engines and medical systems to China over the
last five years, but the number pales in comparison with GE's annual
revenue of $50 billion.
   And Ball Corp., a $1.1 billion Muncie, Ind., container maker, has
spent just $2 million since 1987 on its joint container-making
venture in China.
   ``From our perspective, it's a very small percentage of sales,''
said Ball spokesman Brad Wilks.
   Still, companies do not want to mothball their China operations.
``It's clearly not because of the money,'' Sullian said. ``It's the
effort. They've spent five or six years building'' a relationship.
   For businesses, the attraction is formidable: China looms as the
fastest growing economy in the world with a gross national product
that has mushroomed at more than 10 percent a year.
   As a market for consumer goods, China is virtually untapped. The
nation's 1.1 billion population is a solid reason ``companies are
reluctant to just bag it. You can't just write off 25 perent of the
globe,'' one China watcher said.
   While most U.S. companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, a
few have found opportunity in the crisis. Jack Shamash, president of
the New York-based trading company Shamash &amp; Sons Inc., said he has
been snapping up Chinese-made products ranging from silks to nails.
   Now that Shamash's competitors are skittish about buying, prices
of Chinese-made goods are lower and the goods are more abundant.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said some American staff of the 175
U.S. companies operating out of the Chinese capital are returning
despite a travel advisory and the embassy's counsel against it.
   The Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lure
businessmen back, even as it simultaneously wages a media campaign
against the U.S. government for alleged interference.
   American companies are being bombarded with long-sought
concessions from the Chinese government and atypical promises of
prompt payment.
   Government-owned Noble Tower, a modern Beijing building that
houses foreign companies, sent faxes to every tenant ``asking them
to come back and that everything is peaceful,'' said one American
tenant.
   But businesses are wary that they may become pawns in China's
powerful propaganda game.
   ``We don't want to be in a position where we're manipulated and
paraded in front of cameramen,'' said Ball Corp.'s Wilks.

   Stock prices moved higher today, rebounding from
a round of selling Monday as interest rates declined in the bond
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.62 to 2,533.00
at 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by almost 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 934 up, 506 down and
516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 143.09 million shares with one
hour to go.
   Traders said the gains indicated the impact of Monday's more than
20-point decline in the Dow industrials had waned. Many traders
cashed in profits Monday after the market rallied last week, pushing
the Dow industrials up more than 45 points.
   Declining interest rates in the bond market helped propel stocks
higher, analysts said.
   Today's gains also were attributed to institutions attempting to
complete their second-quarter trading ahead of the July 4 weekend to
prepare midyear portfolio reports for clients.
   ``I think the market is finding a trading range here,'' said
Eugene Peroni, director of technical research for Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc. ``There seems to be good buying interest today.''
   The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid
gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators
that inflation would not accelerate. That would be positive news for
corporate earnings.
   UAL was up 7~ to 147[ on unconfirmed reports that Texas investor

<HEAD>Wheat Leads Rise In Crop Futures, Soviet Buying Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wheat market led grain and soybean futures
prices to a sharply higher close Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, reflecting ideas that the Soviet Union is seeking to buy more
U.S. wheat.
   The rally drove wheat futures to their highest level since
mid-May and erased most of Monday's steep losses in the corn,
soybean and oat markets.
   Unlike the other grains, wheat futures had risen Monday on signs
that the Soviets had bought up to 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat
at market prices, an indication that they had an immediate need for
the grain.
   Tuesday's rally was fueled by speculation that the Soviets would
be back for more wheat and by reports of rain-induced harvest delays
in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat _ the
variety reportedly sought by the Soviets _ is grown.
   ``There are also a lot of quality concerns in the soft red wheat,
which makes large-scale buying particularly bullish,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York.
   At the close of trading, wheat was { cent to 10\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $4.12 a bushel; corn was
3{ cents to 4} cents higher with July at $2.62{ a bushel; oats were
4} cents to 5{ cents higher with July at $1.53{ a bushel; soybeans
were 4 cents to 13{ cents higher with July at $7.40 a bushel.

<HEAD>Six-Year-Old Airline Typifies Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By INGER SANDAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thirty years ago, Ed Beauvais left an
accounting job at a steel company for one in the airline industry
that offered $15 more a month. Today, he operates the nation's
10th-largest airline.
   America West is a prototype of successful companies in the 1980s
_ slick, opportunistic, oriented to employees' needs. A child of
deregulation, the 6-year-old airline made $10 million last quarter
while some other carriers waded in red ink. It projects a $30
million profit this year.
   While metal fatigue made headlines last year in the wake of fatal
accidents, America West fielded a fleet of 74 aircraft, mostly
Boeing 737s and 757s, averaging only 5.6 years old.
   ``We have a very good market niche ... and we've always been
adequately financed and our people are extremely productive,''
Beauvais says. ``You have to have all these elements in place or you
cannot deal with the significantly competitive atmosphere that we
have.''
   America West recently failed in its most ambitious undertaking _
an attempt to buy Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle out from under
developer Donald Trump _ despite offering $50 million more than
Trump.
   But Beauvais, the 52-year-old chairman and chief executive whose
swashbuckling image is stamped on his airline, didn't get where he
is by putting his eggs in one basket.
   America West has applied for federal approval to start flights to
Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo and is constantly on the lookout for
opportunities to expand into other markets.
   America West succeeds primarily because of strong leadership,
said James Carey, a senior vice president with Airline Economics
Inc., which publishes Airline Quarterly in Washington.
   ``They have proven to be able to make adjustments to their
operating strategies as the marketplace requires,'' Carey said.
   ``I do like the fundamentals of the company,'' said Paul Karos, a
financial airline analyst for First Boston Corp. in New York. ``They
clearly are well into a turnaround.''
   For its first five years, America West averaged about 65 percent
annual growth in carrying capacity but lost money in all but one
year, Karos said. In 1988, he said, the company began to slow its
growth in seat-miles to focus on profitability.
   It posted a profit in the second quarter of 1988 and has been
profitable each quarter since then.
   ``They changed their operating strategy,'' Carey said. ``They
actually changed from their emphasis on long-haul operations and
re-emphasized the feeder services through Phoenix and have improved
their profitability because of that revenue growth.''
   Carey said trans-Pacific air service is growing at a higher rate
than travel to Europe and is almost triple domestic growth.
   Beauvais said America West was serious about buying the shuttle
but ran out of time to come up with the financing. The airline is
going ahead with expansion of service to the East Coast through
Washington's National Airport and New York's LaGuardia via landing
slots acquired in May.
   America West needs approval from the U.S. Department of
Transportation and the Japanese government before it can start
service to Japan and Australia.
   Deregulation provided opportunity but also unprecedented
competition, and most of the new entrants failed.
   ``There's not many survivors,'' Beauvais said. He is one of them.
The Colorado native entered the industry in 1960 as an accountant
for Frontier Airlines and moved through jobs in Las Vegas, Phoenix,
San Francisco and Washington.
   In 1981, while in Phoenix for a second time, he linked up with
current company president Mike Conway, who had quit as a vice
president of Continental Airlines.
   By 1983, Beauvais, Conway and five others had raised $20 million
through public stock offerings and bank financing and were ready to
fly.
   The company started service Aug. 1 of that year with 280
employees and three Boeing 737s, serving four points between Los
Angeles and Kansas City, Mo.; today, America West has 8,800
employees and serves 47 cities.
   Beauvais said he chose the Phoenix area because no carrier
dominated the region.
   ``Other airlines failed to see the opportunity,'' he said. ``The
timing was right to build a hub-and-spoke system.''
   Two constants of the airline's history have been its original
marketing slogan _ ``Less Fare, More Care'' _ and management's
willingness to bend over backward to keep its employees from union
afflilation.
   America West offered ``more care'' through assigned seating,
complimentary beverages and free copies of the Wall Street Journal
and USA Today. After some complaints about late flights, the carrier
recovered and ranks first in on-time operations for the period since
the Department of Transportation began keeping figures in 1987.
   America West employees are stockholders who participate in a
profit-sharing program. Employees move around, working as a flight
attendant one day and taking reservations or doing ramp duties the
next.
   ``It's helped America West be extremely productive and given
individuals very good professional atmosphere,'' Beauvais said.
   The practices apparently convinced employees to reject two unions
in elections this year and keep their airline the nation's largest
without any unionized employees. Continental Airlines is largely
non-unionized but has a weak flight attendants' union.
   Beauvais' second-floor office is directly beneath the flight
paths into and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport,
allowing the chief executive officer the opportunity to watch his
planes land and take off.
   ``I don't regret a moment of it,'' he said. ``I'd never work in
any other industry.''

<HEAD>May Department Stores Considers Sale of Discounters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. Tuesday said it is
exploring the possibility of selling its Caldor and Venture discount
chains.
   Divesting the two general merchandise discounters would enable
the retailer to more easily pursue its intention to concentrate on
its department store and shoe businesses.
   ``The divestiture of Caldor and Venture will allow May to focus
on the operations and expansion of our higher-return and
faster-growing businesses ...'' said David C. Farrell, May chairman
and chief executive officer.
   May, one of the largest retailers in the country and owner of
Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht's, Sibley's, plus other department stores and
specialty shoe chains, said it anticipates using a significant
portion of the proceeds from a possible sale to buy back its stock.
   The remainder of any proceeds would be spent on general corporate
purposes, including investment in the department store operations
and shoe businesses, the company said in a news release.
   May management have been working to restore Caldor to higher
levels of profitability and recently have expressed optimism about
Caldor's prospects.
   Caldor, which operates in the Northeast, was taken over by May in
1986 as part of the acquisition of Associated Dry Goods. Caldor's
operating earnings came to $50 million in 1988 on sales of $1.6
billion.
   May launched Venture in 1970. It operates in the Midwest and last
year had operating income of $81 million on sales of $1.3 billion.
   Both Venture and May sell a range of items including hard line
goods, such as appliances, and soft line goods, such as clothing.
   Thomas A. Hays, May's president, described Caldor and Venture as
two ``well-positioned businesses with excellent management and
committed associates.''
   As a condition of any sale, May will insist on provisions
regarding jobs, compensation and benefits for Caldor's and Venture's
employees.
   Retail industry analysts had been expecting that May eventually
would shed Caldor and Venture.
   ``I think it was something we were all expecting them to do,''
said Jeffrey Edelman, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``But it is a
little earlier than expected.''
   Edelman said he thought May would have waited to look for buyers
until Caldor and Venture had shown steady financial progress over a
longer period of time.
   Given May's plan to use much of the money it would get from
selling the two units to buy its shares, the move seems aimed
chiefly at enhancing the value of the retailer's stock.
   Some shareholders had become disgruntled when May diluted its
earnings through the acquisitions of the Associated Dry Goods
properties in 1986 and then the Foley's and Filene's department
store chains in 1988.
   ``I think it's an attractive move for them to make as far as
shareholders are concerned,'' said Edelman.
   Farrell said May has asked the investment banking firm Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. to look into the move.
   With the addition of Foley's and Filene's last year, May's 14
department store divisions produced sales of $7.5 billion and
operating earnings of $802 million. Volume Shoe's sales were $1.1
billion with operating earnings of $138 million.
   May, which is based in St. Louis, currently operates 283
department stores in 29 states and the District of Columbia, 120
Caldor stores in eight states in the Northeast, 73 Venture stores in
the Midwest and 2,628 Volume Shoe stores in 43 states and the
District of Columbia.

   Sustaining success has been difficult for
Eastman Kodak Co. this decade and that's one reason the company's
name keeps coming up on Wall Street as a possible takeover target.
   The company has managed to turn around a sagging bottom line
twice since 1980, only to see the same problems _ increased
competition, a rising U.S. dollar and higher costs _ return to chew
up profits.
   ``It seems like they wipe their brow and say, `Whew, we're glad
that's over,' and they turn around and have to do it all over
again,'' said Mark Obenzinger, a stock analyst for Wood, Gundy &amp; Co.
in New York.
   Call it the three-year twitch.
   Kodak laid off thousands of workers in 1983 saying unfavorable
exchange rates and soft markets overseas had hurt its business. The
company's profits went up 63 percent the next year.
   In 1986, the company had to lay off more than 10,000 workers,
radically restructure the company and start a cost-cutting program
in an effort to remain competitive.
   Profits more than tripled the next year and set a record in 1988.
   Now in 1989, after profits declined 23 percent in the first
quarter of the year, the company has announced plans to cut costs by
consolidating its photofinishing and consumer photography units,
which could mean hundreds of layoffs.
   ``It does seem to go in cycles and we're at the point where the
company is under pressure again,'' said Eugene Glazer, a stock
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Meanwhile, Kodak is having trouble controlling expenses at
Sterling Drug Co., which it bought for $5.1 billion last year. And
the company is battling in court to prevent a large damage award to
Polaroid Corp. in the two companies' patent infringement lawsuit
over instant photography.
   As if all these problems-that-won't-go-away aren't enough, Kodak
was named last month as the No. 1 emitter of the industrial
pollutant methylene chloride by a Washington-based environmental
group.
   Analysts point to several reasons for Kodak's roller-coaster ride
through the '80s.
   First and foremost is the value of the U.S. dollar.
   When the dollar is strong compared to other countries'
currencies, Kodak gets hurt in two ways: its profits overseas are
smaller when translated back into dollars, and foreign rivals gain a
price advantage in sales to the U.S. market.
   This double whammy hurt Kodak throughout the first half of the
decade and helped competitors like Fuji Photo Film Co. and
Agfa-Gevaert Inc. loosen Kodak's strangle hold on photographic film
sales around the world.
   In the 1970s, Kodak sold between 90 and 95 percent of all
photographic film in the world. Today, that has fallen to between 80
and 85 percent, according to industry estimates.
   The dollar has been gaining strength for the past year and,
unless it weakens soon, Kodak is going to have to continue cutting
costs to offset the losses it will bring.
   ``I'm not sounding alarm right now on the dollar, but I'm getting
ready to,'' Kodak's Chairman Colby Chandler said. ``If it hasn't
started down by year-end, I'm going to be concerned.''
   Chandler said it's difficult to determine how much of Kodak's
woes can be traced to outside factors like the dollar or to
management decisions made by Kodak executives.
   ``America basically has sort of a chip on its shoulder these
days. We're always trying to find who's to blame for something,''
Chandler said. ``Instead of taking responsibility, we have learned
to blame everyone else but ourselves for what goes wrong.''
   He said he doesn't want Kodak to join that chorus.
   In an effort to become more in control, Chandler said the company
is planning to sell a number of its businesses that have either been
developed within the company or been acquired.
   ``Each one will not make a significant impact on the company or
the public eye, they're not that big. But the idea is very powerful
inside the company,'' Chandler said.
   Kodak remains a benevolent corporate father figure to the
Rochester area, where it remains the largest employer, said Peter
Enderlin, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``Their idea of dramatic cost-cutting and dramatic restructuring
really isn't that dramatic,'' Enderlin said. ``They still have a
mentality that is somewhat paternalistic.''
   Questions about Kodak being too nice only pump up the takeover
talk on Wall Street.
   Rumors have swirled in the past few weeks speculating that
corporate raider Carl Icahn has begun looking at the company and
that Kodak might be considering a merger with General Electric Co.
   With takeovers sweeping corporate America, stock analysts aren't
surprised that Kodak's name has popped up on the merger and
acquisitions menu, but most agree a takeover of the company is
unlikely.
   ``These rumors get started because the company has
characteristics that attract corporate raiders, but the odds are
against a takeover attempt,'' said Glazer.
   Kodak is a well-known name, it's in a good industry and it's
being managed for long-term growth, three things that appeal to
corporate raiders who want companies that can be changed around to
yield more money right away.
   ``I guess there are some people who believe that some outside
group can wave a magic wand and change Kodak from an ugly duckling
into a beautiful swan,'' said Enderlin of Smith Barney. ``It's not
that easy.''
   Kodak's businesses are complex. The company also has a number of
hurdles that give it some protection from potential hostile
takeovers.
   The company is incorporated in New Jersey, which has tough
anti-takeover laws. If a raider acquired a majority of Kodak stock,
management could issue enough new stock to friendly buyers to
outvote the raider.
   The company also has about $13 billion in long- and short-term
debt, which would increase the cost of a leveraged buyout.
``Nothing's impossible, but a takeover attempt would be hard to
believe,'' said Obenzinger.

   The former head of the British unit of Japan's
Nissan Motor Co. was fined $10,000 Tuesday for filing a false
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission about his
ownership of penny stock.
   The defendant, Frank Shannon, 56, of Hove, England, pleaded
guilty April 18 to a criminal information before U.S. District Judge
Kevin Duffy of Manhattan. Duffy could have sentenced Shannon to five
years in prison and fined him $250,000.
   Prosecutors said Shannon had understated his ownership of stock
in T.S. Industries Inc. According to court papers, Shannon filed a
statement with the SEC on May 16, 1988, that said he had control
over more than 1.5 million T.S. shares. Shannon was charged with not
reporting nearly 1 million additional shares of T.S. stock that he
controlled.
   According to prosecutors, Shannon was an investor in T.S. stock
through Haas Securities Corp., a brokerage house that collapsed nine
days after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   Prosecutors maintain that Haas' alleged scheme to artifically
raise the prices of penny stocks _ inexpensive securities traded
over the counter _ could not be maintained after the market dropped
and share prices tumbled.
   Eugene Laff, former Haas chairman, was charged in March with 15
counts of conspiring to manipulate the prices of stocks to increase
their value.

   Stock prices rose today on the strength of
declining interest rates and rising oil stocks.
   The market gave up some ground late in the session but still
managed to rebound somewhat from Monday's decline, when many traders
cashed in gains made during last week's rally.
   Declining interest rates in the bond market helped propel stocks
higher, analysts said. Lower interest rates improve the outlook for
corporate profits.
   Analysts also attributed today's gains to institutions attempting
to complete their second-quarter trading ahead of the July 4 holiday
weekend to prepare midyear portfolio reports for clients.
   The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid
gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators
that inflation would not accelerate.
   Oil company stocks rose broadly because of a rise in crude oil
prices, traders said. Airline stocks also generally were higher.

   UAL Corp.'s stock jumped higher Tuesday, fueled by
a report that a group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass had
acquired up to 3 percent of the company, which owns United Airlines.
   Bass spokeswoman Susan Hawkins declined comment on the report in
USA Today, and UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company would not
comment on the stock activity.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, UAL rose $6.75 to $146 a
share. The jump followed gains of $1.75 on Monday and $15.50 for all
of last week.
   Analysts said speculators have taken an intense interest in
airline companies following an international investor group's deal
last week to buy NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, in a
deal valued at $3.64 billion.
   The airline industry's strongest performers _ including American,
Delta, United and USAir _ may have much higher value than their
stock prices indicate, said analyst Louis Marckesano of Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   ``I think the Northwest bidding and the subsequent publicity has
kind of highlighted the potential value of the four or five strong
majors, the ones who are strong and prosperous and have been that
way for years,'' Marckesano said.
   ``The mentality seems to be that if NWA can be taken over, why
can't anybody else?'' said Robert Decker, an analyst with Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   United is the nation's second-largest airline after American in
terms of paid passenger miles.
   United owns 80 percent of its 408-jet fleet, the highest
percentage among the major carriers and one of the factors that
could enhance its appeal to suitors, analysts said.
   A buyer could conceivably sell the owned aircraft and use the
money to pay off debt from the acquisition and lease other aircraft.
   United also has a large route network in the Pacific, the world's
fastest-growing air-travel region.
   UAL is the successor to Allegis Corp., which formerly owned the
airline, the Hertz car rental company and the Westin International
and Hilton International hotel chains.
   Allegis embarked on a major restructuring in 1987, after the
investor group Coniston Partners acquired a 13 percent stake and
threatened to mount a takeover of the board of directors to force a
breakup of the company.
   Coniston contended that the stock market would value Allegis more
highly if it dumped its non-airline businesses.
   Allegis sold its non-airline companies and renamed itself UAL,
which was its title before it acquired those businesses and renamed
itself Allegis.

<HEAD>Wall Sees More Initial Spending If Congress Restricts New Agency's
Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will be forced to
double its initial spending on savings and loan rescues if Congress
restricts the financial power of the new S&amp;L bailout agency, thrift
regulator M. Danny Wall said Tuesday.
   If a congressional conference committee next month adopts the
House version of the S&amp;L bill, Wall said the new agency, called the
Resolution Trust Corp., would need to spend at least twice the $50
billion it is due to receive over the next three years.
   The House bill, unlike the Senate version, forbids the bailout
agency from issuing promissory notes or loss guarantees extending
its liability beyond the $50 billion.
   Wall, speaking at a conference of the U.S. League of Saving
Institutions, the industry's largest trade group, said $50 billion
represents the net cost of closing and merging insolvent thrifts. It
reflects the cost after the government recovers some of its expenses
by selling real estate inherited from failed S&amp;Ls, he said.
   Unless the agency can rescue institutions by issuing promissory
notes and paying them off years later after the government sells the
real estate, the initial cash outlay needed will be at least $100
billion, he said.
   In that case, President Bush would be forced to ask Congress in
several years for more money.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, insisted on the restriction, arguing that Wall's agency,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, abused its note-writing powers
last year and, in effect, spent money without congressional approval.
   He has said he wants to ensure the Resolution Trust Corp., which
will take over some of the bank board's duties, will not have
similar leeway.
   Wall also complained about another provision in the House bill
that makes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. the primary regulator
of state-chartered S&amp;Ls, taking away that power from the agency that
will succeed the bank board. Wall's agency, under the Senate
version, retains its power over both state and federal S&amp;Ls.
   Wall said that would create conflicts of interest in the future
because the FDIC, as the insuror of S&amp;L deposits, likely will become
part-owner of rescued institutions. The FDIC should not regulate
institutions it owns while at the same time regulating privately
owned competing institutions, he said.
   On another topic, Wall said both the House and Senate S&amp;L bills
do not give his agency and the FDIC enough power to allow
capital-deficient savings and loans to continue operating.
   Wall said that even advocates of very tough capital rules believe
regulators ought to have the leeway to allow undercapitalized S&amp;Ls
to continue operating provided they are profitable, have competent
managers and stick to a plan to increase their capital.
   However, a recent review by bank board lawyers indicates that
regulators do not have enough authority to grant that leeway.
   ``There's too much pressure to say no and not enough ability to
say yes,'' he said.

   The dollar drifted lower Tuesday against all
major currencies except the Japanese yen in thin, choppy trading.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
troy ounce of gold at $375.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.25 from late
Monday.
   Currency dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish
but that many traders were reluctant to buy the currency prior to
the Independence Day holiday and in the absence of any market-moving
news.
   ``There's a real sense in the market that this lull is a welcome
respite after what we've experienced in the last couple of weeks,''
said J. Thomas Stanley, a vice president at Chemical New York
Capital Markets Group.
   The dollar has risen sharply in recent weeks, then fell back last
week amid concern that central banks will intervene to thwart its
rise and over worries of higher interest rates overseas.
   The dollar came under pressure abroad Tuesday on a report that
the West German Bundesbank might consider an interest-rate hike at a
meeting Thursday of its central-bank council.
   The battered British pound, meanwhile, gained ground against the
dollar, helped by a surprising narrowing in the British trade
deficit in May and news that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher agreed
with other European leaders on plans toward monetary union.
   At least two rounds of intervention by the Bank of England also
encouraged the pound's recovery.
   In London, the pound cost $1.5640, more expensive than $1.5450
late Monday. Sterling bought $1.5660 later in New York, up from
$1.5450.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 141.23 yen. It was quoted
lower at 141.07 yen in London, and at 141.75 yen in New York, up
from 141.10 yen late Monday.
   Traders said the yen was hurt by reports in Tokyo that Japanese
Prime Minister Sousuke Uno was prepared to resign due to allegations

   Stock prices rose Tuesday on the strength of
declining interest rates and rising oil company shares.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which declined 20.49
points Monday, finished up 14.99 at 2,526.37.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 9 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 916 up, 546
down and 504 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 171.09 million shares, up from 143.60
million in the previous session.
   The market gave up some ground late in the session but still
managed to rebound somewhat from Monday, when some traders were
cashing in gains made during last week's strong rally.
   Declining interest rates in the bond market _ where prices rose
by nearly $10 per $1,000 in face value on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond _ helped propel stocks higher, analysts said. Lower
interest rates improve the outlook for corporate profits.
   ``We're back to the same old lockstep environment,'' said Peter
Barry, director of research at Fahnestock &amp; Co. ``The dollar _ the
flight to safety worldwide _ is taking bonds up and lower interest
rates are taking stocks up.''
   The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid
gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators
that inflation and would not accelerate and interest rates would be
stable or lower.
   Analysts said the market also received a boost from the strength
of key blue-chip stocks, especially IBM, which rose 2\ to 114\ as
the most actively traded stock. Digital Equipment, another key
technology issue, rose 3| to 95\.
   ``IBM was a bellwether leader today,'' said Eugene Peroni,
director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. ``That certainly helped to keep confidence at a fairly
high level.''
   Analysts said the gains also reflected how large institutional
investors were attempting to complete their second-quarter trading
ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend to prepare midyear portfolio
reports for clients.
   Oil company stocks rose broadly due to to a rise in crude oil
prices, traders said.
   Chevron gained 2{ to 55], Atlantic Richfield rose 1\ to 94|,
Amoco increased 1{ to 46\, Mobil gained 1~ to 51] and Texaco was up
1\ to 50~.
   UAL soared 6} to 146 on unconfirmed reports Texas investor Robert
Bass was part of a group that had acquired a stake in the company,
parent of United Airlines. AMR, parent of American Airlines, was up
} to 65{. NWA, the parent of Northwest Airlines that agreed to be
acquired for $3.64 billion last week, was down [ at 115\.
   Time fell } to 163\. The media giant rejected a $200 a share
takeover bid from Paramount Communications Inc. after the market
closed Monday. Paramount was down ~ at 59{, while Warner
Communications, which Time is offering to buy for $70 a share, was
up \ at 59[.
   Among decliners, Teledyne dropped 5{ to 370, Reynolds &amp; Reynolds
fell 2| to 26 and Pioneer Electronics slumped 3{ to 48}.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 203.87 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $17.14 billion, or 0.53
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.98 to 183.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.41 to 375.71, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index gained 1.84 to 328.44.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.26 to 448.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 366.43, up 2.42.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Surge With Hopes For Soviet Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices bounded to a six-week high Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of further buying of U.S.
wheat by the Soviet Union, which apparently is strapped for supplies.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower
while oil and precious-metals futures were mixed.
   Wheat settled { cent to 10} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $4.12{ a bushel; corn was 3} cents to 5 cents
higher with July at $2.62} a bushel; oats were 4} cents to 5{ cents
higher with July at $1.53{ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 13
cents higher with July at $7.38{ a bushel.
   The rally pushed wheat futures to their highest level since May
15 and erased most of Monday's steep losses in the corn, soybean and
oat markets.
   Unlike the other grain markets, wheat futures had risen Monday on
rumors the Soviets had bought up to 500,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at market prices, an indication they had an immediate need for
the grain.
   Most of the Soviet Union's recent purchases of U.S. grain have
been through the Agriculture Department's Export Enhancement
Program, which effectively subsidizes grain sales and requires
buyers to submit bids in a process that is not always speedy.
   After the close of trading Tuesday, the USDA said private
exporters had reported sales of 400,000 metric tons of soft red
winter wheat to the Soviet Union for delivery during the current
marketing year, which began Oct. 1.
   Tuesday's rally was fueled by speculation that the Soviets would
be back for more wheat and by reports of rain-induced harvest delays
in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat is
grown.
   ``There are also a lot of quality concerns about the soft red
wheat, which makes large-scale buying particularly bullish,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, reversing Monday's trend.
   The hog market led the way down, reflecting lower spot hog prices
and perceptions that the market was nearing a top.
   Cattle futures were pressured by slack demand and ample supplies.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .07 cent higher with August
at 70.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent
lower with August at 81.25 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .87
cent lower with July at 49.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .80 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at 34.75 cents a
pound.
   Heating-oil and crude-oil futures rose for the fifth straight day
on the New York Mercantile Exchange but the gasoline market's rally
ended with a modest decline.
   Analysts said the market's uncertain performance indicated that a
downturn _ a so-called technical correction _ was likely.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 6 cents to 23 cents higher
with August at $20.48 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .88 cent
higher with July at 50.53 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .01
cent to .25 cent lower with July at 63.68 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures rose slightly while silver futures were nearly
unchanged on New York's Commodity Exchange, in quiet trading that
reflected the dollar's mixed performance against other major
currencies.
   Gold settled $1.50 higher across the board with August at $379.80
a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 1 cent lower with July at
$5.31 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Greenspan Back on the Job After Suffering Heat Exhaustion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
returned to his office Tuesday after spending the night at a
hospital for treatment of heat exhaustion, a spokesman said.
   Greenspan, 63, was rushed to George Washington University
Hospital Monday night after becoming ill at a dinner at the home of
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, spokesman Joseph R. Coyne said.
Greenspan had played tennis earlier in the day when temperatures
were in the 90s.
   Coyne denied what he said were market rumors that Greenspan had
suffered a heart problem.
   The Fed chairman was released from the hospital shortly before 10
a.m. EDT and returned to work in the afternoon.
   Greenspan began a four-year term as Fed chairman in August 1987
and has led the central bank's campaign against inflation by
tightening credit and boosting interest rates. The Fed recently
began to ease its grip on credit amid signs that economic growth was
slowing.
   Greenspan served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
under President Ford from 1974 to 1977 and was chairman of the
National Commission on Social Security Reform from 1981 to 1983.
   He also served as a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy
Advisory Board.
   Greenspan was born March 6, 1926, in New York City and received a
B.S. degree in economics, an M.A. degree in economics and a doctor's
degree in economics, all from New York University.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Says Drexel Sanctions Decision Will Come After Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange is
indicating the Big Board will take disciplinary measures against
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for the firm's involvement in Wall
Street corruption.
   However, an NYSE spokesman said Tuesday the exchange would wait
for Drexel to settle the sweeping criminal securities fraud case
brought against it by the federal government before deciding what
sanctions if any to impose on the investment firm.
   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650
million in penalties to settle its criminal case, which involved
alleged securities law violations stemming from the insider trading
scandals linked to now-jailed speculator Ivan Boesky.
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said in an interview with the
Wall Street Journal that the settlement represents ``the biggest
failure of the (supervisory) system in the history of the financial
markets.''
   Phelan did not specify what sanctions were being considered, but
the exchange could fine, censure or suspend the firm and employees.
Issues before the exchange include whether top Drexel officials
failed to supervise employees properly.
   ``The last thing we want to do is come out looking like a wimp,''
Phelan said.
   Phelan made comments last week that raised doubts about whether
the NYSE would follow up on the federal sanctions being levied
against Drexel by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Justice Department.
   ``I'm not sure what purpose we would serve by adding any more to
that since the commission could have done everything including bar
(Drexel) as a broker-dealer,'' he told a group of reporters.
   Exchange officials maintain Phelan was not indicating the
exchange would not take action against Drexel.
   ``We have not yet determined what action if any the New York
Stock Exchange will take in the Drexel case,'' spokesman Rich
Torrenzano said. ``That determination will be made in the coming
weeks and months once federal regulators have completed all of their
deliberations and settlements.''
   A federal judge last week approved a civil settlement between the
SEC and the firm that places Drexel under strict supervision for
three years. Approval of the separate criminal settlement is pending
before another judge.
   Once that happens, Phelan said, ``we will go full blast.''
   ``The exchange has been talking to the SEC and has been examining
the SEC's proposed settlement,'' Torrenzano said.
   In 1985, the NYSE fined E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. $400,000 and censured
its president and chief financial officer for failing to supervise
the firm properly after Hutton pleaded guilty to federal mail and
wire fraud charges in a wide-ranging check-kiting scheme.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil and wholesale heating oil futures
continued to climb Tuesday, carried aloft largely by technical
buying.
   Gasoline futures prices pulled back.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate rose 23 cents to $20.48 per 42-gallon barrel. The
contract closed with a gain of 54 cents on Monday.
   Contracts for later delivery of WTI, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, posted similar increases.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the July
contract for No.2 heating oil gained 0.88 cent to settle at 50.53
cents a gallon, adding to Monday's gain of 0.16 cent. Other contract
months of heating oil also finished higher.
   The contact for July delivery of unleaded gasoline edged down by
0.01 cent to 63.68 a gallon after Monday's surge of 0.77 cent.
Contracts for August, September and October gasoline delivery also
declined.
   Mary L. Haskins, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said the rally in the crude futures pits was sustained with the help
of technical buying.
   Buying bred more buying as traders pushed the price of crude
futures past thresholds considered significant.
   ``The technicals have pointed upward now for a week and a half
and until we get some dramatic bearish news the market will keep
moving higher,'' said Haskins. ``The market looks like it wants to
head to $21 or $21.20 (a barrel) in the near term.''
   The market also has been getting a lift this week from news that
some OPEC members intend to curb crude production.
   Published reports have said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
two chronic overproducers, will reduce their output levels closer to
the amount desired by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Kuwait previously had rejected its OPEC-imposed production
ceiling and set its own quota.
   Both Kuwait and the UAE reportedly now plan to scale back
production levels but keep them above the amount mandated by the oil
cartel at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, earlier this month.

<HEAD>Time-Paramount Struggle Could Affect Future of Friendly Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that Time Inc. has rejected a sweetened $12.2
billion takeover bid from Paramount Communications Inc., the focus
of their struggle is shifting to Delaware, not only the fate of Time
but also the future of friendly mergers may be decided in court.
   Time is fighting to preserve a planned merger with Warner
Communications Inc. _ and it is that merger on which the takeover
fight may turn.
   Paramount, after announcing its original $175-a-share, or $10.7
billion, bid on June 6, filed suit in Chancery Court in Delaware to
stop the transaction that would create Time-Warner Inc., the world's
largest communications concern. All three companies are incorporated
in Delaware.
   Time and Warner first proposed their friendly stock-for-stock
merger transaction in March. After Paramount began its pursuit of
Time, the merger agreement was amended and Time began a $14 billion
tender offer for its would-be partner.
   Paramount contends Time opened up a Pandora's box _ effectively
putting itself up for sale _ by announcing it would merge with
Warner.
   Under Delaware law, if a company has put itself up for sale, its
board is required to seek the maximum value for shareholders. If the
court rules that Time in fact put itself up for sale, the company's
board could be hard-pressed to reject Paramount's $200-a-share bid,
which is $74 higher than the price at which Time stock traded before
Paramount announced its bid.
   Time rejected Paramount's latest offer Monday, calling it
financially inadequate and subject to too many conditions. Time
contends that its merger plans with Warner did not put the company
up for sale, meaning its board does not have to consider higher bids.
   A court hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 11.
   The case has generating much interest among companies and
corporate lawyers because of the possibility it could set a
precedent affecting mergers between other companies.
   Many U.S. companies _ including about half of the Fortune 500 _
are incorporated in Delaware to take advantage of state tax laws
aimed at attracting business. As a result, business law decisions by
the Delaware courts _ which have established a strong reputation in
dealing with corporate issues _ widely are seen as important
precedents.
   Harry DeAngelo, a professor at the University of Michigan, said a
ruling in Paramount's favor could place a chill on friendly mergers
such as the original Time-Warner deal in favor of cash buyouts.
   ``You would want to make sure, if you didn't want to be acquired,
you were clearly the buyer'' in a deal, he said.
   But DeAngelo said a ruling favoring Paramount would not
necessarily mean an end to mergers such as the Time-Warner deal, and
predicted that corporate lawyers would find a way to structure
mergers in accordance with such a ruling.
   ``You'll see a period of uncertainty and people will tread
carefully as they get used to the new rules,'' he said.
   Donald Margotta, a professor at Northeastern University in
Boston, said that even if the court rules in Paramount's favor, a
merger transaction structured differently from the Time-Warner
proposal might not be affected.
   However, Margotta said, a ruling against Time is ``going to make
it much more difficult'' to accomplish a friendly stock-swap merger.
   Many observers decline to predict how the court might rule, but
some believe the fight will come down to a question of money and
Paramount's $200-a-share bid.
   ``The legal issue is nothing more than a subterfuge for some
basic economic conflicts,'' said Alfred Rappaport, a professor at
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
   Time stock has fluctuated since Paramount announced its bid, as
traders try to forecast how the court might rule and how the
struggle will end. On Tuesday, Time stock slipped 75 cents to
$163.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Warner was up 25 cents to $59.12{ a share, and Paramount was down
87{ cents to $60.37{ a share.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Moving Some Jobs to Jersey City; New York City Miffed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has decided to move about
2,600 jobs to Jersey City, N.J., and New York City officials said
they have decided to remove the firm as senior underwriter for
future municipal bond offerings.
   ``They are now a New Jersey company,'' said George Arzt,
spokesman for Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   However, the giant financial services firm, which currently
employs about 13,000 people in New York City, said its headquarters
would remain in Manhattan.
   ``Even after this move, the firm will continue to be the largest
employer among securities firms in New York,'' said Fred Yager, a
Merrill Lynch spokesman.
   Merrill Lynch's planned 43-story office tower is to be built on
the site of a former Colgate-Palmolive factory in Jersey City. The
site, still owned by Colgate, is being developed by the Linpro Co.
of Berwyn, Pa.
   ``We were very disappointed to learn today of Merrill Lynch's
decision to relocate 2,600 of their employees from Manhattan to New
Jersey,'' Koch and city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin said at a
late afternoon news conference at City Hall. ``Accordingly, we have
agreed to remove Merrill Lynch as the senior managing underwriter
for any future New York City bond offerings.''
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean issued a statement in Trenton,
N.J., applauding the firm's decision to move to the Hudson County
waterfront.
   ``By combining all the standard incentives available at the
state, county and local levels, we are able to construct a winning
financial package,'' he said.
   New Jersey is hoping Merrill Lynch's relocation will energize its
efforts to redevelop the waterfront area.
   Rick Cohen, director of the Department of Housing and Economic
Development in Jersey City, called Merrill Lynch's announcement ``a
major shot in the arm to the waterfront development.''
   ``It's been a little slow and this is really going to perk up the
waterfront and stimulate other tenant leases,'' he said.
   Details of the financial package offered to Merrill Lynch by New
Jersey were not available.
   Terms of the Linpro-Merrill Lynch agreement were not disclosed,
but the move is expected to reduce Merrill Lynch's annual occupancy
costs for the operations by 50 percent.
   ``We don't disclose those costs, but I can tell you the reduction
is 50 percent,'' said Yager.
   The jobs being relocated to Jersey City involve back-office
administrative functions in support of Merrill Lynch's consumer
investment and capital markets businesses.
   Separately, Merrill Lynch said it will relocate approximately 500
data center employees to Manhattan and Staten Island from Boston and
from Somerset and New Brunswick, N.J.

   The Federal Communications Commission denied a
request to delay a new pricing scheme scheduled to go into effect
July 1 for the nation's largest long-distance company, AT&amp;T, the
agency said Tuesday.
   The requests for a stay had been filed in June by the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. and La Telefonica Larga Distancia, which had said the
new plan to place a ``cap'' on the prices American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. can charge would put the two companies at a
competitive disadvantage. They also said the plan would harm the
public interest.
   But the FCC, in a decision reached Friday and made public
Tuesday, said the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a
stay and that the public would benefit from the new pricing.
   The so-called ``price cap'' plan, which the FCC adopted in March
after a two-year study, replaces a 20-year-old ``rate of return''
regulatory scheme that had placed limits on what AT&amp;T could earn
above its costs. Most recently that limit was 12.2 percent.
   FCC spokeswoman Patricia Chew said the commission also was
reviewing other petitions to suspend the price cap plan, so it was
not immediately known if the plan would go into effect July 1.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was confident it
would prevail.
   ``We expect price caps will go into effect July 1,'' Linnen said.
   AT&amp;T last month told the commission it would lower its prices by
$140 million on July 1, through reductions is basic long-distance
rates and its special Reach Out America calling plan.
   In its decision, the FCC said ``Price cap regulation offers
significant consumer benefits that do not exist under rate of return
regulation. ... In light of the proposed decreases, we believe that
the public interest weighs strongly in favor of proceeding with the
implementation of our price cap rules.''
   The price cap plan allows AT&amp;T, which in 1988 controlled 68
percent of the U.S. long-distance market, to raise rates 3
percentage points less than the rate of inflation in three
categories of service: residential and small business; 800 calls;
and other business services, mainly for large customers.
   The FCC has said the plan is intended to give AT&amp;T an incentive
to cut costs and that consumers could save $900 million in charges
over four years.
   Under rate-of-return regulation, AT&amp;T's long-distance rates have
dropped 38 percent since 1984. Much of that decrease, however, has
resulted from higher prices consumers have been paying to connect to
local telephone networks.
   With consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paid
less to the local telephone networks, and the FCC has forced AT&amp;T to
pass those savings along to its long-distance customers.
   Puerto Rican Telephone argued that AT&amp;T will be able to apply the
``flow through'' savings to individual services in a way that would
disadvantage competitors. The company also argued that the FCC
should consider price cap regulations for the local Bell operating
companies at the same time it does for AT&amp;T.
   The FCC has proposed to impose price caps on the seven Bell
companies beginning in July 1990.
   La Telefonica Larga Distancia, a Puerto Rican long-distance
company, argued it would be harmed by the access charge provisions
and that the FCC should have imposed tighter limits on AT&amp;T price
changes.
