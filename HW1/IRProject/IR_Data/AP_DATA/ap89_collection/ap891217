   Robert D. Blue, a champion of the
elderly who served two terms as Iowa's governor in the 1940s, has
died of complications from a stroke. He was 91.
   Blue died Thursday at Trinity Regional Hospital in this city
about 70 miles northwest of Des Moines.
   The son of a locomotive engineer and a teacher, Blue worked his
way up from county attorney to city attorney, state representative,
speaker of the House and lieutenant governor. The Republican served
as governor from 1944-48 before losing a primary in his bid for a
third two-year term.
   Blue made enemies in organized labor during his second term when
he supported and signed what became known as Iowa's Right to Work
law, which prohibited companies from barring non-union employees.
   Other than the four years he served as governor in Des Moines,
Blue spent his entire life in his hometown of Eagle Grove 100 miles
north of Des Moines, where he practiced law.
   Blue was a charter member of the Iowa Commission on the Aging in
1965, and served until 1976.
   He also served on advisory committees on problems of the aging
for five governors, on the National Planning Board of the White
House Conference on Aging and on the National Advisory Council of
the Office of Economic Opportunity.
   As governor he pushed through a retirement pension for public
employees, and the inspection and licensing of nursing and
retirement homes.
   Speaking on the loneliness felt by the elderly, Blue once said,
``It isn't the salt and pepper that gives taste to food, it's the
company.''
   ``He made a difference for Iowa, and we are proud to have had
the benefit of his service,'' Gov. Terry Branstad said Friday.
   Blue is survived by his wife, Cathlene; a daughter; five
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Monday afternoon at the United
Methodist Church in Eagle Grove.

   Franklyn G. Jenifer, a Massachusetts educator,
was named president of Howard University on Saturday, the first
time in the predominately black college's 122-year history that an
alumnus has been given the post.
   A 13-member search committee deliberated for more than six hours
before selecting Jenifer, the chancellor of the Massachusetts Board
of Regents, over two other finalists. He succeeds James Cheek, who
retired in June after 20 years as Howard's president.
   Jenifer, a native Washingtonian, received bachelor's and
master's degrees from Howard in 1962 and 1965, respectively. He
earned a doctorate in plant virology from the University of
Maryland in 1970.
   Jenifer has pledged to streamline the school's financial aid and
housing programs, which many of the school's 13,000 students
complain are frought with lengthy delays and red tape.
   Jennifer was picked over acting president Carlton Alexis and H.
Patrick Swygert, an executive vice president at Temple University.
   Prior to his current job, Jennifer served as vice chancellor of
the New Jersey Board of Higher Education and also worked as an
associate provost at Rutgers in New Jersey.

   A federal appeals judge was killed
by a mail bomb that went off at his home Saturday afternoon and his
wife was seriously wounded, authorities said.
   Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance,
58, died instantly when a package delivered to his home went off
around 3 p.m., FBI spokesman Chuck Steinmetz said in Washington.
   Authorities said they had no suspects or motive.
   ``There is speculation that it is drug-related,'' said Tom
Moore, an FBI spokesman in Birmingham. ``We will review that avenue
along with all the cases he's handled. We will talk to everybody
who might have an inkling of what happened. There will be
absolutely no pebble overlooked.''
   It was believed to be only the third time this century a federal
judge has been assassinated.
   ``Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and FBI Director William
Sessions tonight expressed outrage over the murder,'' Steinmetz
said, reading from a statement.
   The judge's wife, Helen, was in serious condition at St.
Vincent's Hospital with lacerations and internal injuries, said
hospital spokeswoman Barbara Traylor.
   The FBI, Postal Service investigators, the U.S. marshal and
local authorities were investigating the blast, said U.S. Attorney
Frank Donaldson. He added that the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms might also become involved.
   State Attorney General Don Siegelman told staff members to
``dedicate every resource of this office to find the perpetrators.''
   U.S. Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said officials were ``greatly
alarmed over his death and we wonder why'' it happened.
   ``As a member of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, they heard
many appeal cases related to drugs from Miami,'' Heflin said in an
interview from his home in Tuscumbia. ``There's speculation in that
regard, but nobody knows.''
   Alabama Supreme Court Justice Janie Shores, a friend of Vance,
said the slain judge's colleagues assumed the blast had something
to do with cases decided by him.
   ``But I didn't know Bob had an enemy in the world. It must ave
been a disgruntled defendant,'' Mrs. Shores said. ``They handle so
many drug-related cases.''
   State Democratic Party Chairman John Baker, who said he had
known the judge for about 20 years, said he couldn't imagine who
would want to harm Vance.
   ``I can only speculate that it had something to do with cases he
had handled or was handling on the federal bench,'' said Baker.
``It's been so long since he's been a lawyer that I wouldn't think
it had to do with any of those cases.''
   Steinmetz said Sessions described the attack as ``an affront to
the very strength of our democratic society: our justice system''
   The spokesman said Thornburgh said, ``Violent acts, such as that
which occurred today, are at odds with the underlying belief of our
nation and the rule of law. Such acts are to be condemned.
   ``My heart goes out to the family of Judge Vance, who has served
with distinction on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals,'' the
attorney general said.
   Gov. Guy Hunt called the attack ``a cowardly thing'' and ``an
affront against civilization, against our form of government.''
   ``Judge Vance had a very sharp legal mind. He was one of the
leading judges in the country,'' the governor said.
   ``I just hope and pray the perpetrators of this crime will be
quickly brought to justice and receive swift punishment, and our
prayers are with the family,'' Hunt said.
   Vance was chairman of the state Democratic party from 1967 to
1977. In 1978, President Carter appointed him to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
   Heflin said Vance would ``occupy many of the pages of the
history of Alabama for his leadership of reasoned sanity'' as party
chairman during those ``turbulent years.''
   It is believed that only two other federal judges have been
assassinated this century.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco, 56, was shot and killed at
his home in May 1988 by a former New York City police officer angry
at Daronco's dismissal of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by his
daughter. Charles Koster, 67, killed himself after gunning down the
judge.
   District Judge John H. Wood Jr., 63, was killed by a sniper
outside his home in San Antonio, Texas, in 1979. Charles Voyed
Harrelson was convicted of the contract killing and is serving two
life sentences in a Texas prison. El Paso drug trafficker Jamiel
``Jimmy'' Chagra, who authorities say ordered the hit, was
convicted of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of Wood's
murder and various drug charges. He is serving a life sentence in a
federal prison.
   Chagra had been scheduled to go on trial on drug charges before
Wood the day the judge was slain.

   Fires swept through apartments in several poor
neighborhoods Saturday, killing six people, injuring 15 and leaving
scores homeless in zero-degree weather. The dead included three
young children.
   Fast-moving blazes trapped many people on upper floors, and at
least two people jumped from a second-story window to escape
flames, firefighters said.
   ``People were hanging out of the windows when firefighters
arrived on the scene,'' Fire Department spokesman Stanley Spann
said of one fire on the city's southwest side. ``They must have
rescued 20 to 25 people.''
   Two people were killed and 12 injured, including three
critically, in that early evening blaze in a 60-unit building,
Spann said.
   A man was killed and three people injured in a South Side fire.
   The three young children who were killed were trapped in their
attic apartment by a fire that swept through their west side home
before dawn, firefighters said.
   Two women, including the mother of the victims, were forced by
the flames to jump from a second-story window, authorities said.
   Neighbors reported seeing two men running from the building
shortly before the fire was discovered early Saturday, but police
said their investigation turned up no evidence of arson.
   The fire apparently started at about 2 a.m. on an enclosed back
porch and spread quickly through the rest of the house, said
Battalion Chief Frank Chambers.
   The children, Andrew Smith, 2; Jasmine McKinney, 1, and
Dominique McKinney, 3 months, were pronounced dead at the scene.
   Two women, identified as sisters Janet and Geraldine McKinney,
escaped by jumping from a second-story window, and were both
reported in fair condition. Firefighters said one was the mother of
the dead children, but didn't know which one.

   A suspended county judge accused of
running the rural courthouse like a fiefdom was convicted of
bribery and official oppression Saturday but acquitted of open
lewdness and three other counts.
   Suspended Cambria County Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki, who rose from
poverty to win his first judicial election 18 years ago, showed no
emotion as the verdicts were read after 16{ hours of deliberations
over two days.
   O'Kicki faces a maximum term of 26 years and $57,500 in fines.
No sentencing date has been set. On sentencing, he will lose his
$80,000-a-year job and his pension.
   O'Kicki said he will appeal.
   ``This verdict today is a sad day for the justice system in
Pennsylvania,'' O'Kicki said. ``The sad day for O'Kicki was Oct. 8,
1988, when he was suspended.''
   Prosecutors said the 59-year-old judge used fear and favors to
rule the elegant 19th-century courthouse in the foothills of the
southern Allegheny Mountains in eastern Pennsylvania.
   O'Kicki maintained that the charges were prompted by his feud
with a Johnstown political power broker who has family ties to the
lieutenant governor.
   The judge was convicted of six counts involving the acceptance
of $500 from a court employee for a promotion that never came;
asking a Johnstown attorney for $500 after a favorable ruling; and
demanding a favorable settlement on a bank loan.
   Charges included official oppression, demanding property to
secure employment, criminal coercion and bribery. All are felonies.
   He was acquitted of charges of requiring court employees perform
personal chores for him on county time, of open lewdness for
allegedly asking two secretaries into his office while he was
wearing only his underwear, of using inside information about an
estate in a money-making scheme and of seeking a bribe from a
Johnstown strip-mining company.
   O'Kicki also faces a second trial on 16 additional charges
focusing on private business dealings. No date has been set for
that trial.
   The prosecution and defense called 82 witnesses and introduced
nearly 200 pieces of evidence. Testimony began Nov. 7.
   O'Kicki, who prided himself on streamlining the county's civil
court system, was suspended by the state Supreme Court in June 1988
and was indicted in March.
   During two days of testimony, O'Kicki blamed his legal troubles
on Johnstown millionaire W.E. Schonek, the politically influential
father-in-law of Lt. Gov. Mark Singel.
   According to O'Kicki, the millionaire was angry at him for
encouraging Schonek's brother, Rudolph, to make a stock gift worth
more than $200,000 to St. Francis College in Loretto.
   O'Kicki said Schonek yelled threats at him about the gift in
1987 at a Johnstown-Cambria County Airport restaurant.
   Schonek and Singel have denied influencing the investigation.
   Northampton County Judge Richard Grifo, who presided over the
seven-week trial, told the jury that the investigators' motives
were irrelevant.
   O'Kicki sat impassively through the testimony with his second
wife, Sylvia, at his side, but he said the trial was physically,
emotionally and intellectually devastating.
   On the stand, O'Kicki denied the charges as his attorney asked
him about them one by one, answering many of the allegations, ``No,
absolutely no.''
   He broke down in tears once when he referred to his empty home
following his divorce from his first wife, Theresa, in 1986.
   After unsuccessful bids for district attorney's office and
Congress, O'Kicki, a Democrat, was elected judge in 1971 by
defeating the endorsed Democratic candidate in the primary and then
winning the general election.
   He won a retention election for a second 10-year term in 1981
and was elected president of the Pennsylvania Conference of Trial
Court Judges two years later.
   O'Kicki reached the pinnacle of his success in June 1988 by
becoming president of the five-judge county court but a state
investigation into his dealings already was under way.
   Defense attorney Richard Galloway indicated that in the appeal,
he will make an issue of the trial judge's refusal to declare a
mistrial after an unusual development.
   When jurors were asked to state their verdicts individually,
James C. Miller of Johnstown said he disagreed with the other 11
jurors on three of the six convictions. Although an unanimous
verdict is required, Grifo rejected Galloway's mistrial request,
saying he didn't hear any discrepencies.
   Miller, reached at home afterward, said he agreed with the other
jurors' conclusions, although it appeared to courtroom witnesses he
had disagreed when the jury was polled.
   ``I absolutely did,'' he said when asked if he concurred in the
guilty verdicts.

   A Chinese airliner hijacked to Japan was flown
back to Beijing on Sunday, with the hijacker's wife and 10-year-old
son on board.
   The Air China Boeing 747 was heading from Beijing to New York on
Saturday when a knife-wielding man ordered the pilot to fly to
South Korea. South Korea refused permission to land, and the pilot
diverted to Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   President Yang Shangkun, at a brief news conference before
setting out on an 11-day trip to the Middle East, thanked Japanese
authorities for their cooperation in ending the hijacking.
   The hijacker, who was hospitalized, was not on the return flight.
   Police and airline officials said they did not know the status
of the returning wife and child, but foreign reporters saw her led
from the plane in handcuffs.
   The hijacker told police he had participated in China's
pro-democracy protests in June and decided to flee his homeland
after the violent crackdown on the movement, the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. reported.
   The father, who was identified by police as cotton factory
foreman Zhang Zhenhai, 35, is being treated at a hospital for
injuries suffered after he was shoved out the back door of the
plane by a crew member after arriving in Fukuoka, 560 miles
southwest of Tokyo.
   Japanese police said Zhang's wife, whose name has not been
released, said she wanted to return to China. They quoted Zhang as
saying she and the child did not know about his hijacking plans.
   An official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, in
charge of all airlines, said 185 of the 200 passengers on Air China
Flight 981 flew back with the plane and would re-start their
journey. He said the others planned to continue their trip from
Japan.
   CAAC said most of the passengers were Chinese. Japanese police
said there were 19 non-Chinese, including 12 Americans.
   Flight 981 was on a flight from Beijing to New York via Shanghai
and San Francisco when Zhang ordered the plane to fly to South
Korea.
   South Korean authorities refused to allow the plane to land, and
the plane changed course and landed at Fukuoka at 2:52 p.m., nearly
four hours after taking off from Beijing, a Japanese Transport
Ministry said.
   After the plane landed, purser Wei Li opened a rear door and
told Zhang, ``Look, this is Seoul,'' an official of the Fukuoka
prefectural police said.
   When Zhang peered out the door, Wei pushed him out and he fell
to the ground, said the official, who would not give his name. He
said he did not know if Wei was a man or woman.
   Television footage showed Zhang lying face down on the airport
tarmac and later being rushed into a local hospital.
   Zhang suffered injuries that officials said require up to six
months' treatment. A woman companion whom Zhang described to police
as his wife was overpowered, along with a 10-year-old boy.
   Zhang told Japanese police he intended to bring aboard a bomb
but instead left it at a hotel in Beijing, the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. reported.
   Air China is the international division of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, China's state airline.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier was fatally shot
Saturday night as he and three other American servicemen tried to
flee a crowd of Panamanian troopers and civilians, a U.S. Southern
Command spokesman reported.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces said Sunday that the U.S.
servicemen had fired several shots at the military headquarters of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, wounding three Panamanians, including
a soldier and a 1-year-old girl. U.S. officials said the Americans
were unarmed.
   U.S. and Panamanian troops went on alert after the incident, the
most serious in a series of confrontations between the two forces.
American troops in battle gear could be seen around Fort Clayton,
and tanks were heading toward the base. Several unidentified
helicopters flew over the city shortly after midnight.
   A U.S. spokesman, Col. Ronald Sconyers, said four off-duty
American soldiers in civilian clothes were stopped by about 40
civilians and five Defense Forces troopers as they were driving by
military headquarters.
   The spokesman said the crowd tried to pull the Americans out of
the car, and as the U.S. soldiers drove off shots were fired at the
car, wounding one of the Americans. He said the other U.S.
servicemen were not injured.
   The wounded American was taken to the U.S. military's Gorgas
Hospital where he died, Sconyers said. He did not identify the
victim pending notification of his relatives.
   The Defense Forces made no mention of the American casualty in a
statement issued at 4 a.m. Sunday.
   It said a car with U.S. license plates broke through
checkpoints, drove past the Defense Headquarters and fired several
shots at it, wounding three Panamanians. The 1-year-old, Elin
Bethancourt, was wounded in the left arm, the Defense Forces said.
   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, the duty officer at the time, called
the incident ``a provocation against the life and property of our
people.''
   Civilians said Panamanian troopers condoned off the area
surrounding the Defense Forces headquarters.
   The television channel of the U.S. Southern Command announced
that a ``Delta'' alert was in effect, restricting U.S. military
personnel to their bases. That alert was ordered during the October
revolt by a small group of Defense Forces personnel.
   Since May, there have been several confrontations between
Panamanian and U.S. forces in Panama that included shouting
matches, but no shooting.
   A Noriega-organized paramilitary force, the Dignity Battalions,
have demonstrated and tried to block recent U.S. maneuvers. In a
recent letter, the U.S. high command told the Panamanian military
that any action against U.S. personnel would be considered an
action by the Defense Forces.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Noriega, who was declared Panama's chief of government Friday, was
in the western province of Chiriqui late Saturday.
   In appointing Noriega chief executive, the rubber-stamp
legislature said the action was necessary because Panama was in a
``state of war'' with the United States. It based the state-of-war
declaration on severe ecnomic sanctions imposed on Panama in an
effort to force Noriega to step down.
   Noriega had been Panama's de facto ruler as Defense Forces chief.
   The general, who is under indictment on drug-trafficking charges
in the United States, thwarted an Oct. 3 coup attempt when loyal
troops came to his support after he was trapped and held hostage by
the rebels for several hours.
   At least 10 of the rebellious officers and soldiers who launched
the October coup were killed, either in fighting or after they
surrendered.
   Noriega has denied the U.S. drug charges and says Washington's
efforts to oust him are an attempt to avoid complying with the 1977
Panama Canal Treaties. The accords turn the waterway over to Panama
at the end of the century.
   After the October coup he claimed the United States was behind
the revolt, but Washington denied that. Some of the 12,000 American
troops stationed in Panama had blocked streets near Defense Forces
headquarters but they did not become engaged in the conflict.

   A man stole a car and then abandoned two toddlers
that had been left in it, leading police to search with cars and a
helicopter, authorities said.
   The boys, ages 2 and 4, were found about two hours later,
frightened but OK. Temperatures were below freezing when they were
dropped off in a large city park Saturday.
   ``That's the most low-down car thief I've ever heard of,'' said
Detective Roberto Garza. ``Those two little children could have
frozen to death in that dark park, but he just drove away and left
them there.''
   The boys' mother, Araceli Delgadillo, told police she had parked
at a grocery store and had left the engine running. She said she
had told the boys to lock the door behind her. When she returned
after 20 minutes, the car and her sons were gone.
   Police used patrol cars and a helicopter to search for the
missing children. A volunteer found the boys shivering in the park
about 6 p.m.
   No one has been arrested.

   The mayor of this northeastern Ohio city
has been using city stationery to wage a religious battle against
pornography, a tactic critics say violates the principle of
separation of church and state.
   Mayor Donald J. Kainrad is a 37-year-old Roman Catholic and a
self-described born-again Christian who was elected in 1983. He
also heads a local citizens' group against pornography, and has
been sending letters to a national convenience store chain seeking
the removal of Playboy, Penthouse and other adult magazines from
four city stores.
   ``God cannot and will not bless the Dairy Mart corporation or
other businesses that willfully violate his commandment,'' Kainrad
wrote in a Sept. 28 letter to Charles Nirenberg, chairman of
Enfield, Conn.-based Dairy Mart Convenience Stores Inc.
   Nirenberg wrote back, informing Kainrad that a statewide survey
of people entering Dairy Mart stores showed they overwhelmingly
supported customers' rights to buy the magazines.
   The debate intensified after Nirenberg forwarded Kainrad's
letters to Simon, Porteous &amp; Associates Inc., of Great Barrington,
Mass. The non-profit company publishes The Freedom Writer, a
nationwide, 21,000-circulation newsletter that describes itself as
``the national newsletter that defends the separation of church and
state.''
   The newsletter's publisher, Skipp Porteous, a former Pentecostal
minister, threatened Kainrad with a federal lawsuit if Kainrad
continued to use city stationery for his anti-pornography campaign.
   ``He's using his elected position to endorse a religion. A
number of Supreme Court decisions say it's a clear violation of
church and state,'' said Porteous, who said he founded the
newsletter after his Christian zeal ebbed and he became worried
over fundamentalist Christians putting ``the Bible above the Bill
of Rights.''
   Kainrad said in an interview last week that he will stop using
city stationery to write to Dairy Mart and has asked Citizens for
Decency in Portage County, of which he is chairman, to print
stationery.
   However, he added, ``I have a very strong personal relationship
with God, with Jesus Christ. If someone asks me what I think of
pornography, I will respond on city stationery.
   ``As mayor, I'll continue to address my office as a Christian,''
Kainrad said. ``There is not a separation of church and state; I
don't believe that.''
   Kainrad, who displays the 23rd Psalm on his desk, waved a batch
of letters he said were from supporters and said he has received
numerous phone calls as well.
   The mayor also said he similarly wrote Revco, another national
drugstore chain, a few years ago. The chain was one of several that
withdrew adult magazines from its stores in 1986 after
letter-writing campaigns from religious and anti-pornography groups.
   City Councilman Eric Hellekson said Kainrad's mixing of his
personal views with his role as a mayor could set a bad precedent
for this quiet, rural town of 12,000 that lies just beyond Akron's
outer suburbs heading toward Amish country.
   ``My concern is the use of city facilities to support a group
not backed by the city,'' Hellekson said. ``The argument I have is
the use of city personnel making copies of letters. We don't know
if he's been doing a lot of copies and mailing them out around the
country.''
   At the Dairy Mart on Main Street, cashier Robin McElhiney, 19,
said of selling adult magazines: ``The people who buy them are
responsible. If somebody looks too young, we won't sell it.''
   Porteous said Kainrad's remarks that he will use non-city
stationery for future mailings is enough for him to drop his plans
for a lawsuit. He intends to feature the issue in the next edition
of Freedom Writer.
   However, Porteous said he will monitor Kainrad in November when
the mayor traditionally declares Thanksgiving week ``Bible Week.''
   ``I've made a note in my 1990 appointment book so we can head
him off at the pass,'' Porteous said.

   Anti-Western radicals have won several
parliamentary seats in special elections, strengthening hard-line
opposition to President Hashemi Rafsanjani's policy of economic
reform.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
reported late Saturday that former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, a middle-ranking cleric, took 225,570 votes in polling
to win from a Tehran district.
   Another hard-line cleric, Hojatoleslam Movahedi Kermani, also
was elected Friday in Tehran with 287,921 votes, IRNA reported.
   Diplomats said the mid-term elections were seen as a test for
Rafsanjani's policies.
   Sixty-four candidates ran in the elections, called to fill nine
vacant seats in the 270-member Parliament. Iran's official media
reported a heavy turnout but gave no overall figures.
   Most of the seats were left empty when Rafsanjani appointed
legislators to his Cabinet following his election July 28.
   Tehran Radio said four other candidates, including lesser-known
radicals, won seats in provincial centers.
   The state radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said no candidate
won a majority in two other Tehran districts and the provincial
Bandar Turkman constituency, so a second round of voting will be
held.
   The front-runners for the remaining Tehran seats are all
radicals _ former Commerce Minister Habibollah Asgarowladi, former
Labor Minister Aboloasem Sarhadizadeh and former Posts and
Telegraphs Minister Morteza Nabavi.
   Mohtashemi's election marked a comeback for the 43-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist, who has close links with pro-Iranian
militants holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, dumped
Mohtashemi and other hard-liners in August, when he formed a
Cabinet dominated by technocrats designed to revitalize Iran's
economy following last year's cease-fire in the eight-year war with
Iraq.
   Mohtashemi is allied with Ahmad Khomeini, son of the late
revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and considered a
focal point for the radicals espousing the ayatollah's ideological
legacy.
   The hard-liners oppose Rafsanjani's moves to improve Iran's
relations with the West to acquire badly needed investment to help
the post-war economy.
   They contend his policies move too far from the fundamentalist
principles that form the bedrock of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Rafsanjani, while no less committed to the revolution than his
rivals, believes Iran cannot afford to remain isolated and that its
55 million people have had enough hardship after a decade of
turmoil and war.
   Radicals already dominate the Majlis and their gains are likely
to further inhibit Rafsanjani's room for maneuver between guiding
Iran into a more open, prosperous era while preserving Islamic
principles.

<TEXT>
   Brooke Michele Ward, the first bone marrow
recipient to be matched with a donor through a national registry,
died in her father's arms exactly two years after receiving the
transplant in Seattle. She was 8.
   The girl died on the way to Rex Hospital in Raleigh, said her
parents, Marguriete and Michael Ward.
   Mrs. Ward said the leukemia prognosis had been good, but Brooke
continued to be afflicted with graft vs. host disease, a condition
in which the transplanted marrow is rejected by the body.
   Randy Hedgepeth, the girl's doctor, said that problem caused her
death.
   ``They were really encouraged with Brooke since she had made it
two years and had not relapsed,'' Mrs. Ward said. ``It looked like
just a matter of time and her body would accept the bone marrow.''
   Her operation Dec. 16, 1987, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle was the first transplant in which marrow
was located from the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry.
   The girl's struggle brought recognition to the program, with the
registry growing from 23,000 potential donors to 40,000 in the
succeeding six months.
   Brooke met her donor, Diane Walters, 50, of Milwaukee in March,
moments before they appeared live on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.'' They had become friends through letters and telephone
calls.
   Brooke is survived by her parents; brothers Jeffrey Michael Ward
of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and Jerry Lee Ward of Raleigh; maternal
grandfather, C.E. Wheeler of Raleigh; and paternal grandfather,
L.A. Ward of Everette, Wash.
   Funeral services were scheduled Monday in Raleigh.

<TEXT>
   The democratic revolution sweeping Eastern
Europe in recent weeks has been greeted happily by Poles, who have
had the satisfaction of seeing their hard-line neighbors finally
following in their footsteps.
   In a few tumultuous weeks, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria have all seen the birth of mass civic opposition movements
demanding pluralism, abandonment of the leading role of the
Communist Party and free elections.
   For Poland, all those things were old hat. They were won in the
independent Solidarity movement's decade-long struggle, first in
the 1980 shipyard strikes, through the long winter of the
martial-law period and then in the triumphant years of 1988-89 when
the movement was reborn, handily won parliamentary elections and
took control of the government.
   ``Cribbing from Poland,'' one newspaper headline crowed last
week about events in East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   ``We have gone the farthest and without the fireworks,''
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said.
   While much of the world may credit Mikhail S. Gorbachev with
sparking the reform movement in the Soviet Union's former
satellites, Poles generally ask: Would there have been Gorbachev
without Walesa first?
   Even Poland's Communist Party, a minor partner in a
Solidarity-led coalition government after it couldn't form a
parliamentary majority of its own, is patting itself on the back.
   ``We decided a year ago that all the processes would be managed
in an evolutionary way,'' party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said. ``In
the other countries, there was no such logical decision by the
establishments.''
   Amid the joy, there has been the occasional discordant voice,
worrying that Poland might be overtaken by its neighbors in the
race for reforms or elbowed to the sidelines as others seek aid
from the West.
   For instance, the Polish Parliament still has not removed the
clause in the constitution granting the ``leading role'' to the
Communist Party, with parliamentary leaders saying that clause is
obviously moot at the moment but economic issues are more pressing.
   Zdzislaw Najder, a sociologist close to Solidarity, noted in the
government newspaper that other countries are overtaking Poland in
this aspect of constitutional reform.
   ``Faced with this new situation, shouldn't we perhaps reconsider
another acceleration of institutional reforms in this country? This
is not just a matter of winning the race for priority claims _ this
is a question of installing a sound political system and of our
international prestige,'' he said.
   For Poles, the current situation is fraught with irony.
   Normally known as the most restive country in Eastern Europe,
Poland has been an island of tranquility this autumn while its
previously staid neighbors in East Germany and Czechoslovakia were
packing public squares by the hundreds of thousands.
   ``We Poles _ constant rebels, as we were thought of the world
over _ are the prop of stability in Eastern and Central Europe
today,'' government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska declared
at a news conference.
   And the Polish transition to democracy this year was achieved
more through hard, dull negotiating and grassroots political work
than through mass rallies, dramatic gestures or ultimatums.
   Instead of a huge wave of euphoria sweeping Poland after the
installation of a Solidarity government in September, activists
barely stopped to celebrate before getting down to the serious work
of reforming the moribund economy and rebuilding democratic
institutions after 45 years of one-party rule.
   But with the possible exception of the rise of populism in East
Germany, which has been accompanied by reports of anti-Polish
discrimination and has awakened fears of German reunification and
expansionism, Poles express paternal pride in the developments
elsewhere in the region.
   Adam Michnik, editor of the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza, recalled the appeal issued at the Solidarity trade union
congress in 1981 urging the other peoples of Eastern Europe to rise
up.
   At the time it was said, even by union sympathizers, that
Solidarity had gone too far and was inviting Soviet intervention.
   But in his recent travels around Eastern Europe, Michnik told a
gathering of Solidarity activists, he is surprised at how widely
that appeal is still remembered.
   ``Sometimes actions which seem pragmatically unwise in the short
term bear fruit in the long term, in great moral and political
capital,'' he said.
   Michnik said the model created by Solidarity of demanding
independence while eschewing violence or retribution has been
widely emulated.
   ``In this sense, Solidarity's path has become the path of the
most enlightened and best democratic forces in Central and Eastern
Europe,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Four months after a Hollywood
executive and his wife were slain in their mansion, the motive is
unclear although police say they suspect the shootings were
``message'' murders.
   Relatives have maintained that Jose Enrique Menendez,
hard-driving chairman of Live Entertainment Inc., was killed for a
reason related to his video and music distribution business.
   Nothing was stolen from the Spanish-style, $5 million home.
There were no signs the killers forced their way in. No clues were
left at the scene. The couple were killed the night of Aug. 20 by
multiple shotgun blasts at close range. Their sons said they found
the bodies after a night out.
   Police say they are continuing to investigate possible mob links
to the death of Menendez, 45, and his wife Mary Louise ``Kitty''
Menendez, 44. But detectives have pursued many other angles,
including questioning the Menendez couple's sons, Erik, 19, and
Lyle, 21, about the night of the deaths.
   The sons did not reply to an interview request relayed by
probate lawyer Stephen B. Goldberg.
   Police also are looking into the disappearance of an apparent
reference to Menendez's plans to write a new will.
   Under terms of the parents' 9-year-old wills, the sons will
share a $10 million estate that Goldberg estimates will exceed $5
million after debts and taxes are paid _ ``next summer if all goes
smoothly.''
   They also were beneficiaries of a $400,000 life insurance policy.
   Goldberg said he tried to determine a few weeks ago whether the
boys had been ruled out as suspects, but the answer was
inconclusive. ``The only thing I have been able to confirm is that
there are no prime suspects,'' Goldberg said last week.
   Police won't rule out anybody or anything, at least not
publicly. A $25,000 reward posted by family friends had brought in
some leads, police said.
   ``There has been no specific motive determined,'' said Lt.
Robert Curtis, a spokesman for the department. ``It's fair to say
some progress has been made, but that's about all I can say.''
   He refused to comment on the disappearance of an apparent
reference to a new will in the Menendez home computer.
   Family members, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
relative tried to read a computer file named ``will'' after the
murders, but was unable to do so. Before a computer expert was
brought in, the file disappeared.
   The relatives would not say who could have erased the file.
   No new will has been found. The family and Goldberg say they are
convinced none was made, although Menendez had discussed drawing
one up to replace the wills made in 1980 in New Jersey, when he was
far less wealthy.
   Menendez had little money when his parents sent him out of Cuba
after Castro took power. Smart and a perfectionist, he was an
executive for RCA and Hertz before joining Live Entertainment.
   Companies operated by Live had been linked to organized crime
and pornography before Live bought them, but company officials have
vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link.
   Curtis said that was still considered possible, and Menendez's
sister, Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., said not long
after the slayings that the family blamed organized crime.
   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had
been used before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run it
straight,'' she said.
   Richard Stavin, former head of a federal task force into
organized crime's influence in Hollywood, noted that vast amounts
of money are at stake in the booming video business, and said,
``It's conceivable that this could be a mob hit.''
   Meanwhile, the family says the sons have tried to get on with
their lives. Talented tennis players, they practice obsessively
nowadays and talk of getting into the real estate business. It's
unclear if Lyle will return to Princeton University in January.

<HEAD>Legal Loophole Allows Firms to Tap Pensions for Cash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. corporations are skimming billions of
dollars from their employees' pension programs to finance buyouts,
ward off takeovers or simply pocket the profits.
   These ``reversions,'' legal under a 1974 law, face growing
criticism amid warnings that parts of the nation's $2 trillion
private pension system are on shaky ground and could eventually
force a massive taxpayer bailout.
   Big business, backed by the Bush administration, argues that the
pension raids only involve surplus money, most of it supplied by
the employer in the first place. Some unions and workers, however,
say they are being robbed of money that is rightfully theirs.
   Corporate raiders, taking hundreds of millions of dollars in a
single reversion, have attracted most of the attention. But big
business isn't alone in taking advantage of the law.
   Some 2,000 companies have applications pending with the Internal
Revenue Service for pension reversions. Among them, according to
IRS documents obtained by The Associated Press: The Museum of
Modern Art in New York, which is seeking $17 million; the Detroit
Athletic Club, seeking $842,000; Niagara University, $500,000; the
St. Louis Country Club, $736,000.
   The 1974 Employment Retirement Income Security Act, known as
ERISA, allows employers to pull back the money by terminating the
pension programs and paying off the employees, usually with a lump
sum.
   Industry statistics show that 25 percent of the plans are not
replaced. In many other cases, the pensions are succeeded by
programs that provide fewer benefits. And even if a plan is
restored, it has been stripped of its cushion against potential
future losses from bad investments or stock crashes.
   The Labor Department estimates that about 80 percent of private
pension plans contain some sort of surplus, making them potential
targets.
   Michael S. Gordon, a Washington pension attorney, likens the
maneuver to ``breaking into a piggy bank.''
   ``In order to get its mitts on what is usually a surplus, the
employer will terminate the plan. Not for any sound business
reason, but to help finance a takeover or ward off one,'' Gordon
said.
   ``That money should stay in the retiree system,'' said James B.
Foley, a retired American Red Cross vice president whose former
employer took an almost $100 million reversion this year.
   The West German company, Tengelmann Group, recouped the money it
used to buy Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. by terminating the A&amp;P
pension plan and netting more than $200 million. On the other side,
Union Carbide helped thwart a takeover by GAF by pulling $500
million from its pension plans.
   Exxon Corp. drew a record $1.6 billion reversion in 1986.
   The government's official tally shows that since 1980, about
2,000 companies have terminated their employer-paid plans to nab
about $26 billion. And those figures do not include the far more
numerous reversions of less than $1 million.
   Ten reversions of more than $1 million were completed in May and
June of this year, the IRS documents show. At the same time, 298
smaller ones were completed.
   Jeffrey Mamorsky, a New York pension attorney and author, says
the money is a well-deserved reward for companies, large or small,
that have managed their pension programs well.
   ``We don't live in a communist country,'' he said. ``There's
nothing that's forcing employers to install the plan or keep the
plan.''
   Gordon, who helped write the ERISA law, disagrees. ``The
attitude of the (Bush) administration and business is totally at
war with the interests of the beneficiaries across the United
States,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum says he's been fighting for six years to
make it tougher for companies to skim off the excess money.
   ``I don't think it should be legal,'' the Ohio Democrat said.
``I'm not saying any of these people are being evil; I just say
they're being unfair.''
   But Mark Ugoretz, executive director of the ERISA Industry
Committee, argues that restrictive laws will cause employers to
dump their plans.
   ``Ultimately you will see a complete reduction in plan
funding,'' Ugoretz said. ``It would weaken the retirement security
of people in the plans. It would substantially jeopardize the
status of the PBGC.''
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, is the
federal insurer for employer-paid plans. Already holding a deficit
of $1.5 billion, the PBGC gets most of its revenues from premiums
paid by the companies.
   James B. Lockhart, executive director of the PBGC, said most of
the deficit stems from the beleaguered steel industry but noted
that pension funds of the major airlines are underfunded by about
$2 billion. Should they collapse, the burden would fall on the
federal agency.
   Papers obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed that
Delta Air Lines and Pan American World Airways are among the
companies that have been fined by the PBGC for making late premium
payments. Both have underfunded plans.
   The PBGC also filed a contingency claim against Eastern Air
Lines to cover an estimated pension plan underfunding of $1.1
billion.
   The pension agency faces another threat from the Dallas-based
LTV Corp. The company declared bankruptcy in 1986 and saddled the
PBGC with claims of about $2.3 billion for more than 108,000
employees.
   LTV has since restructured and come out of bankruptcy, but
contends that the government should still have to pay its pension
obligations.
   The case is before the Supreme Court, where a ruling in favor of
LTV could open the door to similar maneuvers by other companies
seeking to dump their pension obligations on taxpayers.
   ``Like the federal savings and loan insurance program, the
pension termination insurance program is in dire financial
condition,'' the Justice Department says in a legal brief backing
the PBGC's suit.

   Parents and students at Chattahoochee Elementary
School knew that a child there had AIDS. They didn't know who. So
third-grader Brett Lykins decided to tell them.
   ``It was my turn to go up'' for show-and-tell on Friday, he said
afterward in a soft, unwavering voice. ``I just went up and said I
was the one. It's been hard to keep this secret. I decided not to
keep it anymore.''
   Brett's identity had been kept secret from all except the
principal and his teacher, in accordance with the Gwinnett County
school system's 2-year-old AIDS policy.
   ``I think the kids in class felt really happy that I did this,''
he said. ``I think some of them knew I had it, but there were some
who didn't.''
   One classmate told Brett, 9, she would pray for him every night,
said his mother, Marty Lykins, who accompanied her son to school
after he told her of his plans to reveal his secret.
   Another friend gave him a wind-up doll. ``She said she wanted me
to have it. But that's not why I did this. I don't want them to
give me a lot of stuff. I just want them to know.''
   After show-and-tell last week, Brett's teacher, Nancy Terry, led
the class in a health lesson that focused on AIDS, which destroys
the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers.
   Brett's father, Steve Lykins, said his son's health has been
relatively good despite the AIDS infection, which was contracted
from a blood transfusion received shortly after his premature
birth. His parents learned in 1987 that he had the disease, and
Brett was told this year.
   Health experts say Brett's presence in class does not endanger
his classmates.
   Ms. Terry said Brett's show-and-tell session ``was a wonderful
experience. ... The children have been so nice.''

<HEAD>Judge's Ad Finds Delinquent Parents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fifty-five people responded to a judge's
newspaper ad that they'd be jailed for not paying child support
unless they appeared in court.
   Judge Stephen E. Levin had placed an ad in the Philadelphia
Daily News a week ago, listing 142 people accused of delinquency in
child support payments. The judge's message: Appear in court Friday
or ``YOU WILL BE JAILED!''
   ``This is an experiment, and I think it's worked out very
well,'' Levin during a break between cases.
   The ad, which cost the court $5,525, listed 136 men and six
women and offered ``ONE LAST opportunity to appear and work things
out.''
   In addition to the 40 people in court Friday, 15 others had
surrendered earlier in the week and resumed support payments.
   Several men waiting their turn said they had been alerted to the
ad by friends.
   ``When I went to cash my check, the guy told me,'' said an
electrician who declined to give his name. ``I couldn't believe
they put it in the paper. I felt like I had murdered somebody or
something.''
   The man said he fell behind in his support payments for his
9-year-old after losing his job about two years ago and then ``got
scared and took off'' when a bench warrant was issued for his
arrest.
   Many of those waiting to be heard Friday were angry and said the
ad had embarrassed them and their families.
   ``They printed my father's name on the list and he is very
embarrassed. My name is Joseph Ciambella Jr., and they left off the
`junior,''' the younger Ciambella said.
   ``I'm the one who hasn't paid my child support, and it's because
I haven't seen my son, who's 5, in two years. My mother and father
have only been able to see him five times since he was born.''
   Levin said if the ad proves to be cost effective, he will run
others.
   ``These people are really afraid. What will happen is that a lot
of people who would have totally ignored us will pay what they owe
in child support,'' he said.
   ``It is clear that there will be some people on the list who are
not deadbeats, but they will be rare exceptions,'' he added.

   A chronic pilot shortage has forced
Northwest Airlines to cancel hundreds of flights in recent months
and prompted the airline to temporarily cut back its pilot training.
   But the carrier says its flight cancellations are back at
``normal'' levels and contends its record for the 12 months before
October was consistent with that of other major airlines.
   Some of the carrier's pilots say postponing training could only
aggravate the problem, according to a story in Sunday editions of
the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   ``That's the best that can be said about it,'' said Gerald
Wallin, Northwest's senior director of flight administration until
mid-August. ``It's like eating your seed corn.''
   In October, Northwest canceled 707 flights for non-mechanical
reasons _ 1.8 percent of all flights. That's the worst rate among
the 13 major carriers, according to an internal U.S. Transportation
Department report obtained by the newspaper.
   Wallin and others called the number of halted flights
extraordinary and said they believe cancellations at Northwest
stemming from pilot shortages have at least doubled since early
this year. The Transportation Department, which counts canceled
flights, would not release historic data for comparison.
   Other major carriers facing fast industry growth have had
similar problems with flight cancellations. According to the
Transportation Department figures, USAir cancelled 1.3 percent of
its flights for non-mechanical reasons in October, followed by
United, which cancelled 1.1 percent of its flights.
   A statement from the suburban Eagan-based airline acknowledged
that cancellations were higher than normal in late October and
early November. However, it said its record for the 12 months ended
Sept. 30 was ``consistent with the performance of all other major
airlines.''
   ``It is unfair to judge Northwest's flight schedule
dependability based on only one month.''
   The statement also said, ``Northwest has not at any time
canceled required FAA training for its pilots.''
   A Northwest spokesman would not elaborate on the statement.
   But Northwest employees past and present said the situation is
troubling because the airline has scrapped many high-revenue
international flights on large jetliners.
   Moreover, the carrier's new owners hope to build the airline by
wooing new passengers with good service. Northwest chairman Alfred
Checchi intends to double the size of the airline in the next five
years to help reduce $3.1 billion in debt from his group's August
takeover of the company.
   A group led by Checchi bought the nation's fourth largest
carrier for $5.65 billion. In September, Checchi became Northwest's
chairman when former chairman Steven Rothmeier and Rothmeier's top
four executives resigned.
   Northwest's problem with cancelled flights has been building
over several years, according to pilots and former managers, and
was exacerbated by top-level decisions during the years Rothmeier
ran the carrier.
   ``Rothmeier's group continually had a pilot shortage and they
never hired enough pilots to meet demand,'' said Duane Woerth, a
member of the Master Executive Council of the Northwest chapter of
the Air Line Pilots Association union, which represents the
carrier's 5,400 pilots.
   Woerth and others said Northwest is taking steps to remedy the
problem. In mid-November, it halted all pilot-advancement training;
the company said it is continuing to train newly hired pilots.

   Fifth-grade teacher Susan Nardinger is
rallying the faithful in this river city to defend its short
reputation, which has been assaulted once again by river rats in
Lincoln City, Ore.
   Students in Nardinger's class touched off the battle two years
ago, when they petitioned the Guinness Book of World Records to
declare the 201-foot-long Roe River northeast of Great Falls the
world's shortest river.
   Guinness editors agreed, and the Roe displaced Lincoln City's D
River in the 1988 edition of the record book.
   But Lincoln City was not about to be sold short.
   They remeasured the D River and announced that it was 120 feet,
mysteriously smaller than the last measuring. And, Guinness editors
notified the Lincoln City Chamber of Commerce recently that the D
River would be back in the books by the 1991 edition _ unless a
shorter river is found.
   Well, that's just what students in Great Falls intend to do, and
they'll look no farther than the Roe.
   Nardinger said the Roe could claim a length of only 30 feet
because it has two forks, and the students submitted the longer of
the two for consideration of the record.
   ``I stand behind the kids 100 percent,'' she said Friday.
   She dismissed the D River as an ``ocean water backup,'' not a
river at all and suggested Guinness officials take a look for
themselves.
   Molly Peterson, one of the students who helped petition on
behalf the Roe, took a more philosophical approach. She said the
Roe is still the shortest river, but ``records are made to be
broken.''

   A 6-foot alligator out for an evening
stroll on a suburban sidewalk drew a neighborly reaction from Ruben
Hernandez. He tackled the meat-eating reptile, kept it safe for its
owner and refused to tattle.
   ``I grabbed the tail and put a foot on (the alligator's) back,''
he said. ``I started screaming to put the duct tape around the
alligator's mouth.''
   Hernandez, 32, said he took a few shots to the head wrestling
the 200-pound alligator when the beast whipped its powerful tail,
but he and his brother-in-law loaded the gator into their pickup
truck.
   When the sun came up Friday, Hernandez watched the huge reptile
lash at a chain holding it in the truck and questioned his bravado
of the previous night.
   ``I could have gotten hurt,'' he said.
   Hernandez said contacted the animal's owner and arranged to
return the beast. He refused to identify the owner, who officials
said lacked permits to keep the exotic animal.
   ``I can't imagine that anyone in possession of an alligator
legally would allow it to run loose in an area where it could come
in contact with people,'' said Eva Schultz, a warden for the
California Department of Fish and Game in Long Beach.
   She said it is illegal to keep an alligator without a special
permit, adding that those permits are rarely issued.

   Ms. Crier, 35, has had a 2-month-long TV career, all as

many television critics to launch blasts at her.
   ``It really has been an accelerated learning process,'' Crier
said. ``It has been a situation in which I didn't have time to

Which was good in terms of alleviating personal stress, because you

   Ted Nugent hopes to inspire a packed
house, not for one of his frenzied guitar extravaganzas but for
something just as close to his rock 'n' roll heart: the right to
hunt.
   Some residents of Milford Township, claiming the community 50
miles north of Detroit has become too densely populated, have
petitioned to ban hunting. That struck a sour note with Nugent, who
wrote a letter urging opponents of the ban to attend a hearing
Monday night.
   ``You, the good people of Milford Township, should not allow
anyone to take away your God-given, morally sound, environmentally
necessary, Michigan tradition, the right to hunt,'' Nugent said in
a letter to supporters of the Citizen's Rights Protection
Association.
   Nugent probably won't attend the meeting, said his
brother-in-law, Jim O'Keefe, who runs Ted Nugent's Bowhunting World
Inc. in Grand Haven.
   The hearing will be held by the Hunting Area Control Commission,
comprising representatives of the state Department of Natural
Resources, state police, Oakland County Sheriff's Department and
the township. The panel will hear arguments from both sides and
later make a recommendation to the Milford Township Board.

<HEAD>Recession Fears to Prompt Cuts, Experts Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will move
to push interest rates lower, possibly as early as this week,
private economist say.
   The expected round of credit easing in response to evidence of a
weakening economy and moderating inflation would cause a variety of
business and consumer rates to fall, the economic forecasters say.
   Among the rates that could drop would be the prime rate and home
mortgage rates.
   The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting Monday and Tuesday
for its final strategy sessions of the year. Most analysts were
looking for the Fed to decide to reduce a key interest rate, the
federal funds rate, by another 0.25 percentage point.
   ``Fed officials have more than enough evidence to justify
another easing step before the end of the year,'' said David Jones,
chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. ``It will take
additional easing steps to guarantee that we don't go into a
recession. I think we will avoid a recession, but just barely.''
   Some analysts said the reduction could come before the week is
out while other analysts said the rate drop might not occur before
early January.
   The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on
overnight loans, is the primary lever the central bank uses to
control short-term interest rates.
   When it does fall, economists were predicting that the benchmark
prime lending rate, to which one-third of all business and consumer
loans are tied, would be cut from 10.5 percent to 10 percent with
another cut to 9.5 percent expected before summer as the Fed eases
further.
   Analysts were looking for mortgage rates to drop as well in
response to the Fed's credit easing moves. Many predicted that
fixed-rate mortgages, which have already fallen to a national
average of 9.75 percent, could fall as low as 9.25 percent by next
summer.
   Jones and other economists point to various signs that the
economy is passing through a period of extreme sluggishness, with
unemployment beginning to inch back up, raising fears that some
unexpected shock could spell the end of a recovery that has already
lasted a peacetime record of seven years.
   When 1989 began, the central bank was in the midst of a
year-long effort to push interest rates higher in an effort to
dampen demand and keep inflationary pressures in check. However, in
May the Fed switched course and began a series of gradual easing
moves as signs mounted that economic growth was beginning to slow
in response to the earlier credit-tightening.
   Inflation has eased with the slowing of growth.
   On Friday, the government reported that wholesale prices fell in
November for the third time in the past five months, with the drop
led by a big decline in gasoline costs.
   ``Inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank has
a margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economic
growth,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   The Bush administration has complained that the central bank has
been too timid in its credit-loosening campaign and will have to
bear the blame if the economy does go into a nosedive.
   But the consensus among most economists is that the Fed's dose
of easy money has come in time to keep the country out of a
recession.
   Before the Fed began its gradual credit-easing moves, the
federal funds rate stood at 9.75 percent. It is now at 8.5 percent,
having been reduced in a series of five 0.25 percentage point drops.
   Jones said he expected the federal funds rate would fall to 7.75
percent before the Fed calls a halt to its easing campaign.
   But when the economy begins to rebound next summer, many
economists were looking for the Fed to reverse course once more and
begin tightening up on credit to guard against triggering higher
inflation.
   ``We think the economy will start accelerating in the second
half of next year and inflation will become a little worse as labor
costs begin to accelerate,'' said David Wyss, senior financial
economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.

   While the heavy metal rock band Motley Crue
sent 16,000 screaming teen-agers into high-decibel heaven, Phil and
Kathy Hawkins sat across the hall writing Christmas cards in a
quiet paradise reserved for the kids' chauffeurs.
   The Hawkinses joined more than 200 other parents recently in the
``Quiet Room'' at the Capital Center, a suburban Washington arena
that says it pioneered the idea of providing a noise-free sanctuary
for parents who drive their children to rock concerts.
   Since the Capital Center opened its quiet room in October 1986,
similar facilities for parents have spread to arenas in many other
major cities. They include the Spectrum in Philadelphia, the Great
Western Forum at Los Angeles, Madison Square Garden in New York,
the Superdome in New Orleans, the Miami Arena, the Palace in
suburban Detroit, the Scope at Norfolk, Va., the Richfield Coliseum
at Cleveland and the Nassau Coliseum in suburban New York.
   ``We always had people dropping off their kids and then driving
home again until the concert was over,'' said Matt Amodeo, a
Capital Center spokesman. ``Rather than drive long distances, some
parents would sit in their cars and wait for three hours.''
   When some parents began huddling in the lobby for warmth, Amodeo
and his colleagues invited them into the arena's Capital Club
restaurant, where they were offered free snacks and soft drinks,
magazines and low-volume TV sets.
   Three years later, Amodeo says, veteran rock concert chauffeurs
greet each other like old friends. Some of the single parents who
met in the Quiet Room are dating now. It's become a place to read,
doze, write letters, cut a business deal or fill out income tax
returns.
   ``I'm impressed. This is wonderful,'' said Ruthie Moore, a
visiting nurse who drove her 16-year-old son, Chris, and two
friends from the far-away Mount Vernon area of Virginia. She spent
her first evening in the Quiet Room doing needlework.
   Mrs. Moore and other parents say they like the Quiet Room
because they are close enough to their children to know they are
safe, yet far enough from the musical melee to hear only the
muffled thumps from the megawatt bass speakers.
   Outside the doors, the Capital Center hall was filled with
writhing, stomping ``metalheads'' wearing the de rigeur outfits of
true believers _ torn jeans, leather jackets, black miniskirts,
fishnet stockings, yards of Spandex and pounds of mascara.
   Braces and bellybuttons abounded.
   Brian Hopkins, 15, of Crofton, Md., said he was ready for ``lots
of loud music and fun.'' Aaron Platt, 15, of Reston, Va., stuffed
cotton in his ears in anticipation of ``a whole lot of loud music,
craziness and cigarette smoke.''
   Just as Leslie Morgan, 15, and her sister, Tina, 13, were
watching Motley Crue raise the roof with ``Shout at the Devil,''
their parents, Dennis and Sandy Morgan of Mechanicsville, Md., were
dealing another hand of gin rummy in the Quiet Room.
   ``Any music we like they don't want to buy,'' sighed Dennis, who
prefers country and golden oldies from the 60s.
   ``This is a good place to do some mindless paperwork,'' said
Richard Kenney, 42, opening his briefcase over a supper of pretzels
and ginger ale. Still wearing his business suit, Kenney had raced
his 15-year-old son to the concert from a high school basketball
game in suburban McLean, Va.
   Hawkins, a Coast Guard commander who lives in Woodbridge,
celebrated his 43rd birthday by writing Christmas cards with his
wife while their son, Gary, 15, attended the concert. ``I'm having
a quiet birthday this year,'' he said.
   It was the fourth chauffering stint for Clare Weiland, a
dietician from Waldorf, Md., who drove her 14-year-old daughter,
Kay, and two friends to the show.
   Mrs. Weiland spent the evening reading an Eric Segal novel while
listening to her favorite Kenny Rogers and Neil Diamond tapes on a
portable cassette player.
   ``I remember my first night here,'' she said. ``I sat in my car
out in the parking lot. It was freezing cold. I wore thermal
underwear and layers of clothing, and brought a thermos full of hot
tea. I had a little lamp attached to my paperback so I could read.''
   Mrs. Weiland smiled. ``Crazy, right?'' she said. ``But I'd
rather sit out in the cold than listen to that music.''

<TEXT>
   The frightened faces of
schoolboy militiamen barely in their teens peered from the windows
of a bus commandeered by grinning warriors no older than the
captives.
   The captives and the captors were Tamils from rival guerrilla
groups that have turned on each other in their struggle for
independence from the Sri Lankan government.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam took control of the village
of Iruthayapuram and nearby Batticaloa after a raid Tuesday in
which as many as 100 members of the so-called Tamil National Army
were killed.
   The Tigers' leaders have put away their camouflage uniforms to
negotiate with the government in Colombo for political power, and
the raid was meant to demonstrate that they are the only Tamil
force worth reckoning with in northeastern Sri Lanka, where most
members of their ethnic minority live.
   The Sri Lankan government, which gave up any claims to control
of the Batticaloa district 2{ years ago, acknowledges it is
virtually impotent to halt the Tamil power struggle.
   ``The Tamils are going to liquidate each other,'' said Foreign
Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, who is also the deputy defense minister.
   He blamed the departing Indian peacekeeping force for ``arming
to the teeth'' the Tamil National Army, which was created by
pro-Indian Tamils shortly before the Indians withdrew from the
Batticaloa area.
   India has repeatedly denied training or arming that Tamil force,
despite claims to the contrary by the Sri Lankan government,
families of teen-agers conscripted by the militia and several
longtime Batticaloa residents.
   Asked what the Sri Lankan armed forces should do to prevent the
Tamil infighting, Wijeratne replied:
   ``So do you want us to go and kill all the people? We have
deliberately restrained ourselves. Let good sense prevail.''
   Sending in the Sri Lankan army could lead to a repeat of the
ethnic war that prompted India to intervene in the first place.
   The Sri Lankan government is controlled by the island's
Sinhalese majority. The Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people and, according to Wijeratne, 99 percent of the
army. About 18 percent of the population is Tamil. Most Sinhalese
are Buddhists and most Tamils are Hindus, but there are Christians
in each group.
   It is this Sinhalese domination that touched off the Tamil
separatist revolt in 1983.
   The Tigers and an array of other Tamil militias, alternately
allying and feuding with each other, demanded a separate nation _
or at least autonomy _ to preserve the language, culture and
economic opportunities of their people.
   The guerrilla war led to terrorist attacks and massacres of
Sinhalese civilians. The Sri Lankan military, although unequipped
for all-out war, responded with heavy force that included pitching
barrels packed with explosives out of their light transport
airplanes.
   Six years later, at least 11,000 people have died in the Tamil
revolt, including 1,100 of the Indians who intervened at the urging
of their own nation's politically powerful Tamil minority.
   The Indian force, which started arriving July 30, 1987, is now
withdrawing. It set in motion a political formula to give the
Tamils a measure of autonomy, but it failed in its mission to
disarm the Tigers.
   After 2{ years of fighting the Indians, this once rag-tag bunch
of guerrillas has evolved into an experienced fighting force
determined to deny the Tamil National Army or any other Tamil
rivals the right to run the provincial government in the northeast.
   ``The armed struggle is a means to achieve a political end,''
the Tigers' chief negotiator, Anton Balasingham, said in an
interview in Colombo. ``We are not laying down our guns. We will
have our weapons as long as this problem is there.''
   In Iruthayapuram, a senior Tiger who uses the code name
Karikalan said: ``Now we are going to restore normalcy _ civilian
adminstration, transportation, everything.''
   Karikalan, who had a Czech automatic pistol on his hip, an
Italian machine gun slung over his shoulder and a spare ammunition
clip tucked in the waistband of his camouflage pants, described
himself as ``the political-wing leader'' of the Tigers in the
Batticaloa area.
   As for the frightened Tamil National Army members on the bus,
the 39-year-old Karikalan said: ``After interrogation, they will be
released.'' He would not say how long that might take.
   After Tuesday's raid in Batticaloa, fishermen scooped shrimp and
crabs from the smooth blue water as young Tigers patrolled the road
in trucks and jeeps that had been driven by local government
officials a few days earlier.
   At the Soboraj cinema, where films are shown only during the day
because most people prefer to stay off the streets after dark,
``Uncommon Valor'' starring Harrison Ford was playing. Only 39
people _ about one-fifth the ususal turnout _ bought tickets the
day after the Tigers took the town.

   Would Lebanon's real ambassador please stand
up?
   The request reflects the anomalous situation at the Lebanese
Embassy, where the battle for control of Lebanon is being
re-enacted between loyalists of embattled Christian Gen. Michel
Aoun and supporters of newly elected Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
   Hrawi, who has fired Aoun from all his posts, last week removed
Lebanon's veteran ambassador to Washington, Abdallah Bouhabib, and
handed control of the embassy to the No. 2 diplomat, Sleiman Rassi.
   On Wednesday, the State Department said it had been informed by
Lebanon's new government that Bouhabib had resigned effective Dec.
11 and Rassi was now in charge. The Department said that since it
recognizes the Hrawi government as the legitimate ruler of Lebanon,
it would now deal only with Rassi.
   So far, so good.
   But Aoun _ who is holding out with 20,000 troops at the
presidential palace in Beirut and refuses to recognize the Hrawi
government _ sent Bouhabib a telex ordering him to stay put.
   ``Aoun says Bouhabib is the legitimate ambassador because he,
Aoun, is the legitimate ruler,'' said embassy spokesman Yousef
Sayah.
   So Bouhabib, a staunch Aoun backer, continues to occupy the
ambassador's office and residence.
   He argues that under foreign service regulations he is entitled
to a two-month transition period to put his affairs in order and
transfer the embassy to his successor.
   ``Even from a humanitarian point of view, you can't just tell
someone who has been in office six years to just leave
immediately,'' said Sayah.
   But Lebanon's Prime Minister, Salim al-Hoss, decided he could.
In recent months Bouhabib had made derogatory statements about
al-Hoss, and the Moslem leader demanded he cede his job
immediately, said Lebanese sources.
   Bouhabib, who owns a house in Washington and whose wife and
children are Americans, turned to his American and Arab friends for
help.
   He asked Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, the envoy of the 22-nation
Arab League, to intercede on his behalf with al-Hoss.
   Maksoud, a skilled diplomat, urged the new Lebanese government
to grant Bouhabib a two-month transition and avoid public
embarrassment, said the Lebanese sources.
   Bouhabib also controls the embassy's bank accounts and has
insisted he will retain control unless he is guaranteed a graceful
transition, they said.
   ``Then, too, he could be hoping that within two months Aoun may
gain control and he (Bouhabib) could stay,'' said one official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   All this leaves the State Department in a bind.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut has been shut for several months for
security reasons, and the main channel of communications with the
Hrawi government is through its ambassador here.
   ``We will deal with Rassi,'' said one American official, adding,
``We're not looking to chase Bouhabib out, but we have to go with
what the new government says.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Planners Recommend Halving US Troops in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Pentagon officials are recommending to
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that U.S. troop strength in Europe
eventually be cut in half if Soviet reductions continue for several
years, The Washington Post reported Sunday.
   The newspaper said that according to defense officials familiar
with option papers presented to Cheney, reducing the current force
of 305,000 U.S. air and ground forces to 150,000 would retain a
``political minimum'' to maintain a military presence in Europe.
   That reduced level would enable the United States to meet global
responsibilities in an era of deficit reduction at home, they said.
   The Post said the proposals recommend the United States for the
first time consider reducing its naval commitment to defend North
American sea lanes in order to reinforce Europe from America in
wartime.
   Pentagon planners also have concluded that the Soviet Union no
longer can count on the armies of its East European allies to
support it in any hostilities, the story said.
   Senior defense officials last week presented Cheney with their
views on U.S. armed forces for the next century during the first
two of nine marathon sessions.
   According to The Post, the meetings were attended by Cheney,
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin L. Powell, military
service chiefs and civilian service secretaries. The sessions will
resume Monday and then recess until January.
   One policy paper assessing Germany's future role in Europe
predicted that some form of reunification will occur ``within a few
years.''
   The Post quoted the paper as saying that ``we will likely face
by the next century a Europe shaped as much by German economic
influence and military potential as by Russian military presence.''
   Meetings this week will cover options for reshaping Pacific
Basin forces and strategic nuclear forces. For next month's
sessions, Cheney has requested a senior review of the Strategic
Defense Initiative and space programs, weapons acquisition and the
defense industrial base.

<HEAD>Two Main Sikh Parties Stay Away From Political Meeting on Punjab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday held a meeting of
political parties to discuss Sikh separatism in Punjab but the two
main Sikh parties stayed away, demanding an investigation into
alleged human rights abuses.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh presided over the meeting, his first
political initiative to address Sikh militants' demands for an
independent homeland in the northern farming state. More than 7,000
people have died in an 8-year-old separatist movement in the region.
   About 40 leaders from 21 parties attended the meeting, and they
later issued a statement that was endorsed by all but one of the
parties.
   ``While serious efforts to find a political solution continue,
the people must be reassured that there would be no letup in the
fight against terrorism,'' the statement said.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party dissociated
itself from the statement, saying it could not be considered a
consensus document since Congress had no part in drafting it.
   Punjab's two main Sikh parties, the Akali Dal-Mann and Akali
Dal-Badal, boycotted the meeting. Before discussions can be held,
they said, tensions must be eased in the state and police must be
investigated for alleged human rights violations.
   Akali Dal-Mann Party, known to be supported by Sikh extremist
groups, won nine of the state's 13 parliamentary seats in last
month's general elections.
   The conference condemned the daily killings in Punjab but made
only one specific recommendation _ repealing a law that gives the
government broad powers to detain suspected extremists.
   The law was passed by Gandhi's government and officials at the
meeting said the recommendation to repeal the statute probably was
the reason the Congress Party refused to endorse the joint
statement.
   Congress issued a separate statement that said the government
asked the participants to reach a consensus without stating its own
position.
   Gandhi was forced to resign as prime minister after the party
failed to maintain a majority in Parliament following the general
elections.
   Singh took office on Dec. 2. He visited Sikhism's holiest
shrine, the Golden Temple, five days later but described the visit
as personal.
   Nonetheless, he was the first prime minister to visit the temple
in five years and the trip was seen as an astute move to assuage
Sikhs angered by an army raid on the shrine in June, 1984.
   The attack was ordered by Indira Gandhi, the former prime
minister's mother and predecessor, to flush out Sikh extremists
entrenched inside.
   She was assassinated four months later by two Sikh bodyguards.
Anti-Sikh riots ensued nationwide and more than 3,000 Sikhs were
killed.
   Militants say India's Hindu-dominated government discriminates
against Sikhs socially and culturally and wants an independent
homeland in Punjab.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority in the state, which borders
Pakistan. Nationwide they make up 2 percent of the 880 million
people, while Hindus make up 80 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Egypt and Syria Try to Settle Rift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad met Sunday with an
Egyptian government minister for the latest in a series of talks
aimed at ending a 10-year-old rift between the two major Arab
powers.
   Egyptian Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif was sent by
Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak.
   Al-Sharif became the first Egyptian presidential emissary to
visit Demascus since Syria broke relations with Cairo in 1979 to
protest the late President Anwar Sadat's peace treaty with Israel.
The rift between the two Arab states has been a major stumbling
block to Arab unity.
   Assad's spokesman, Jibran Kourieh, said the Syrian president
will dispatch a personal envoy to Mubarak within the next few days.
   He said that during the meeting with al-Sharif, Assad
``expressed Syria's keenness to strengthen cooperation with Egypt
in various fields.''
   The Egyptian envoy, accompanied by senior officials of Cairo's
Foreign Ministry, delivered a letter from Mubarak to Assad, who in
turn gave Sharif a letter to deliver to Mubarak.
   The contents were not disclosed. But Sharif said when he arrived
at Damascus airport that the rapprochement that was started ``when
the two leaders met in Casablanca is continuing permanently, and we
are all witnessing the positive developments between the two
countries.''
   Assad and Mubarak met in the Moroccan city in May during an Arab
summit conference. They met twice in October and agreed to build
economic ties in agriculture, oil and industry.
   Sharif said, ``God willing, we hope to proceed forward on the
road of common Arab action and joint struggle through the mutual
understanding between presidents Mubarak and Assad.''
   Egypt was returned to the Arab fold after an Arab summit in 1987
gave the green light to restoring relations with Cairo. Since then
most of the Arab states that severed links in 1979 have resumed
them. Only radical Syria and Libya have yet to do so formally, but
both are now moving down that road.
   Last week, Mubarak and Assad agreed during a telephone
conversation to resume direct flights between Cairo and Damascus by
their national airlines.
   The first Egypt Air jetliner to touch down in Damascus in a
decade landed Tuesday, carrying Maj. Gen. Samir Rashad, Egypt's
deputy transport minister.
   Egypt and Libya restored air links in June and reopened their
border, closed since 1977 when they fought a five-day war.
   Mubarak has lately been acting as a key mediator between Israel,
the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arab states in
trying to forge a Middle East peace settlement.
   Syria also is at odds with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and has
rejected his peace initiative toward Israel, a move strongly backed
by Egypt.

<HEAD>Astronauts Ready to Grab a Giant Christmas Present in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five astronauts are ready to rocket
into orbit on a holiday voyage to capture a prized Christmas
present for eager scientists.
   The treasure is a satellite the size of a small school bus that
has orbited for nearly six years and will crash to Earth in March
if it is not corraled.
   It is called LDEF, for Long Duration Exposure Facility, and is
packed with 57 experiments containing a wealth of scientific and
technological information.
   The astronauts are to ride the shuttle Columbia into space later
this week to track down and retrieve LDEF, which is 30 feet long,
14 feet in diameter and weighs 21,400 pounds.
   They had been scheduled for liftoff Monday, but lagging work at
the launch pad last week forced a delay until Thursday. Sources
reported Saturday the work remained behind schedule and that a new
date, possibly Friday or Saturday, would be set Monday at a meeting
of shuttle managers.
   On Day 2 of the 10-day mission, the space travelers are to
deploy a Navy communications satellite and start several medical
and scientific experiments as commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot
Jim Wetherbee maneuver Columbia toward their target.
   They will rendezvous with LDEF on Day 4, 5 or 6, depending on
the time and day they lift off.
   ``We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families and
loved ones at Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a great
big Christmas present for all the scientists who are working on
LDEF,'' Brandenstein said in an interview. ``We'll celebrate
Christmas when we get back.''
   Brandenstein will steer to within 35 feet of LDEF and mission
specialist Bonnie Dunbar will extend the spacecraft's 50-foot robot
arm to snare the satellite.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' Brandenstein
said. ``But NASA has had plenty experience doing this type of
rendezvous, and Jim and I have practiced it to perfection in the
simulator.''
   Once Dunbar has grasped the satellite, she will hold it on the
end of the arm, turning it frequently, for as long as five hours
while mission specialists Marsha Ivins and David Low photograph
each of its exterior experiments.
   ``Some might have become so eroded or weakened by the long
exposure to space and bombardment by micrometeoroids and atomic
oxygen that they could fall apart during the stress of atmospheric
re-entry or a return to Earth's gravity,'' Dunbar explained. ``So
we want good documentary photos in case that happens.''
   Then she will load LDEF into the cargo bay and the astronauts
will concentrate on experiments for the remainder of the flight,
the second longest planned so far in 33 shuttle missions.
   The flight will be a stepping stone for even longer missions as
Columbia gradually is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days in
1992 and eventually for 28 days.
   Scientists are eager to examine LDEF to learn how various
materials and systems have withstood the long exposure to the space
environment, information that will help in designing permanent
space stations and other long-term spacecraft such as those planned
for a ``Star Wars'' missile defense system.
   ``LDEF is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flight
director, Al Pennington. ``It is chock full of every material we
use in space flight.''
   LDEF has been in space nearly five years longer than it was
supposed to.
   It was launched by a shuttle crew in April 1984 and was to have
been retrieved 10 months later. But scheduling problems and the
1986 Challenger disaster delayed the rescue.
   ``If LDEF is not recovered, the loss would be tremendous,'' said
Robert M. Walker, director of the McDonnell Center for the Space
Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, who is
co-investigator of one of the experiments.
   ``We would not only lose experiments that could provide clues to
the origin of our sun and planets but, more importantly, we will
lose valuable information about the changes and damage to
spacecraft after long exposure to the space environment.''
   Also aboard are 12.5 million tomato seeds, which will be
distributed to American students in grades 5 through university
level for research into such things as germination rates and
genetics.

<HEAD>Film Critic Says Romance Is Gone From Today's Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film critic Rex Reed says he loves movies, but
thinks so much of what is produced today is horrible.
   ``Ninety percent of the films today are toxic waste,'' he said.
``On every screen, you're confronted by the same girls you saw the
night before, buying yogurt and Kleenex at the Safeway.''
   Reed, who was born in Fort Worth, said romance has been replaced
with ``blood-splattering violence and a lot of crude sexual
calisthenics.''
   He also said movie-goers must get the idea that women today are
``whores, emotional cripples or birdbrains.''
   Reed said it isn't really a chore to review movies even though
he doesn't think highly of many of them.
   ``When they're bad, you don't remember them at all, but at least
you had fun for a couple hours,'' he said. ``So I do like movies,
and every time there's a good one, it revives my faith in the movie
business all over again.''

<HEAD>Bennett Calls Legalized Drug Supporters Indifferent to Minorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The argument that drugs should be legalized is
fed by indifference to the fact that a large number of drug users
are minorities, federal anti-drug coordinator William Bennett said
Sunday.
   ``I have to tell you I've heard in some circles, `Well, let them
kill each other,''' Bennett said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week
With David Brinkley.''
   ``That is not worthy of the American people,'' said Bennett, who
did not say who harbored that attitude.
   Bennett, who is director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, has been a vocal opponent of calls to make illicit drugs
legal. Among the advocates of legalization are Baltimore mayor Kurt
L. Schmoke, who is black, economist Milton Friedman, and U.S.
District Judge Robert Sweet, who last week became the first federal
judge to publicly voice such an opinion.
   Friedman and Sweet also appeared on the show, but did not
address Bennett's comments.
   Bennett made his remarks in response to a question by
conservative columnist George Will.
   ``Do you think if the people disproportionately killing
themselves off were white suburban high school students there would
be a different kind of argument going on?'' Will asked. ``I'm
asking is there a certain racial indifference in this argument?''
   ``I'm afraid there is,'' Bennett responded.
   The drug coordinator said that neither Sweet nor Friedman had
that attitude.
   But he said: ``I'm afraid that's in the air. But these are our
children we have to protect, black or white, whatever, and we're
not going to protect them very well if we let this genie out of the
bottle.''
   Sweet and Friedman said that law enforcement efforts, rather
than halting the multi-billion dollar drug industry, are resulting
in wasted money.
   ``What we have now is not working,'' Sweet said.
   Bennett called such arguments ``irresponsible nonsense.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-drug smuggling project to
create radar coverage along the entire U.S.-Mexico border is nearly
complete, with the last two of six surveillance balloons installed
and undergoing final tests.
   Unavoidable radar scrutiny will stretch from the Pacific Ocean
to the Gulf of Mexico when the two helium-filled aerostats begin
full operation early in 1990 at Eagle Pass and Rio Grande City in
southern Texas, officials said.
   U.S. Customs directs the project and already has radar-equipped
balloons operating at Yuma and Fort Huachuca, Ariz., Deming, N.M.;
and Marfa in West Texas.
   The aerostat at Eagle Pass, southwest of San Antonio, probably
will be fully deployed in two weeks, said Judy Turner, Customs
spokeswoman in Houston.
   Radar testing probably will begin this week at the other site,
north of Rio Grande City in Starr County, said Hood Goodrich, site
manager with contractor General Electric Government Services.
   A rutted dirt road provides the only access to the remote,
treeless base, surrounded by ranches thick with brush and cactus.
   The white, fish-shaped, 241-foot-long aerostat already presents
an imposing sight hovering 50 feet above its base near Rio Grande
City. When placed into duty, expected by the end of March, it will
rise 15,000 feet on its tether and will have a 160-mile tracking
range.
   For federal drug agents, the aerostat system will ease the
frustration of not knowing what flies across the border along the
vast stretches out of the reach of fixed radar installations, Ms.
Turner said.
   ``We would certainly hope that it means less air smuggling, that
the traffickers will be forced to use another method or another
route,'' she said.
   The radar balloons will track planes entering U.S. air space and
feed the data to the federal aviation center in Riverside, Calif.
   ``That gives them the information from which to launch an
interdiction or tracking plane,'' Ms. Turner said.
   Since federal agents began a crackdown in Florida several years
ago, much of the drug traffic, especially cocaine, is believed to
have shifted to the Mexican border.
   Ms. Turner said Customs agents believe a sharp increase in drug
seizures on the ground in Arizona during the past year is related
to the radar balloons there, forcing the drug traffic out of the
air.
   Customs also operates radar aerostats in Florida at Patrick Air
Force Base and Cudjoe Key, and another at Grand Bahama Island. More
are planned along the Gulf Coast.

   James Lawlor wants to send a greeting card
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But first, he wants a million
Americans to sign it.
   Lawlor, an Iowa businessman, is touring the country with his
56-foot card as an expression of support for the Gorbachev's
reforms.
   On Saturday, the 34-year-old Lawlor was in this town's suburban
shopping mall, one of 50 stops he is making. He started his trek
last May, taking a break from his safety goggle business in
Fairfield, Iowa.
   ``This is to show the people in the Soviet Union that we do
encourage the positive things Gorbachev is doing,'' Lawlor said.
``It's a way to show them that we _ common, everyday Americans _ do
care and hope for the best.''
   The card, designed by art students at the University of Iowa,
shows the American and Soviet flags overlapping each other behind a
drawing of a dove. Its message, written in Russian, reads: ``Dear
Mr. Gorbachev and the people of the Soviet Union: We the people of
the United States of America wish to express our gratitude for your
contribution towards World Peace. Happy New Year!''
   Lawlor has collected 400,000 signatures so far as he carries his
card in a van. The effort is being paid for by contributions and
T-shirt sales.
   The card is actually his second to Gorbachev. A year ago, he
collected 30,000 signatures in a few weeks on a card sent to
Gorbachev.
   After a final appearance in New York City, Lawlor and a group of
volunteers plan to board a plane Dec. 29 for Moscow, where he hopes
to present the card to Gorbachev and have it displayed in the
Soviet House of Friendship in Red Square.

   Comic Jackie Mason and Mayor-elect David Dinkins
made up at a holiday party, although Mason couldn't resist a few
wisecracks.
   Mason got in hot water in September for calling Dinkins ``a
fancy shvartze with a moustache'' while working on the campaign of
Dinkins' opponent, Republican Rudolph Giuliani. Shvartze is a
derogatory Yiddish word for a black.
   The comedian, with Dinkins by his side, said Saturday he was
glad Dinkins won the mayoral race.
   ``I'm on his side as much as I would've been if I'd been on his
side from the beginning,'' he said. ``I know he's going to call on
me for help a lot, and if he doesn't I'm still going to help.''
   ``There has never been bad blood,'' Dinkins said.
   Before Dinkins arrived at the party for the families of
firefighters killed in the line of duty, Mason joked with reporters
about a report that Dinkins has asked to be called ``Mr. Dinkins,''
rather than ``Dave,'' at news conferences.
   ``They called Truman `Harry.' They called Reagan `Ronnie.' Maybe
if he doesn't like his name, they could call Dinkins `Jackie' and
call me `Dave,''' Mason said.

   The Greek Orthodox Church celebrated
Mass on Sunday in a 16th-century building that it finally restored
after settling a long dispute with the Turkish government with the
help of Jimmy Carter.
   Patriarch Dimitrios II, who led the service, said the reopening
of the refurbished building, which was severely damaged by fire 48
years ago, could help improve relations between Greece and Turkey.
   More than 1,500 people, including representatives from 13
Eastern Orthodox churches around the world, attended the Mass at
the Patriarchal Church of St. George. The celebrants included 400
people from Greece, including four government ministers and two
former premiers.
   The ceremony was broadcast by the state-run ERT television of
Greece.
   Turkey's tourism minister, Ilhan Akuzum, also attended.
   In his address, Dimitrios said he hoped the inauguration of the
building would contribute to the development of peace between
Greece and Turkey, which have been bitter enemies since Turkey
occupied the northern part of Cyprus since 1974.
   Greece's state minister, Nikos Temelis, said after the ceremony
that his country would work toward furthering cooperation between
the two nations.
   A message of congratulations was sent by former President
Carter, who helped obtain the Turkish government's permission to
rebuild the four-story wooden structure, which houses offices and a
small church.
   The building was gutted by fire in 1941. An adjacent building
has been used as the church's offices since then.
   The Turkish government for years denied repeated requests for
permits to rebuild, saying the Greek government had refused similar
project requests by the Turkish-Moslem minority in Western Thrace.
But the Greek Orthodox church was finally granted permission in
1987 after the intercession of Carter and Archbishop Iakovas of
Americas during 1986 visits.
   Turkey, a predominantly Moslem country, is a secular state.
   There are 5,000 ethnic Greeks living in Istanbul, down from
100,000 when the republic was set up in 1923.

   When she lived in near poverty with a young
son, Romy Koecher often heard East Germany's Communist leaders
proclaim they were doing everything they could for the country.
   Now, as disclosures grow about the lavish living of former
leader Erich Honecker and his ousted cronies, she feels deeply
betrayed.
   ``I always knew there were privileged layers in society,'' says
the 32-year-old art historian. ``But people just didn't know the
extent of what was going on.''
   For years, Honecker manipulated the official news media to
proclaim a phoenix-like recovery from the ashes of World War II and
accused the West of waiting to plunder East Germany.
   But according to recent revelations, Honecker and his friends
were themselves plundering the country. There were fancy hunting
lodges, imported foods and clothes, shining Volvos.
   So far, the allegations have hit mainly a several dozen top
Communist Party members, and much of the ousted leadership faces
criminal prosecution. Seven former Politburo members are in jail,
and Honecker is under house arrest.
   Wandlitz, the compound where the party bosses lived, is being
turned into a health center for children. The compound includes an
indoor swimming pool, perfectly manicured grounds and houses that
are the envy of the rest of the nation's 16.3 million people.
   Honecker's summer retreat, complete with two restaurants, is
being turned into a tourist hotel that can accommodate 50 people.
   ``I never knew there were these mafia-like organizations,'' said
Ms. Koecher, referring to businesses set up to hide financial
irregularities.
   The accusations of corruption reached a peak on Dec. 1, when one
member of Parliament suggested the disgraced leaders stashed $54
billion in Swiss bank accounts.
   While prosecutors have not used that figure, they have said that
hundreds of millions of dollars left the country.
   The reform movements in other Soviet bloc countries have not led
to anything like East Germany's anti-corruption fervor.
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel said that if he is elected
Czechoslovakia's president he will try to prevent a ``witchhunt''
against the Communists.
   ``There must be justice, but not revenge,'' Havel said.
   Polish Prime Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki, a member of the
Solidarity opposition, has cut off government subsidies that helped
the Communist Party build a vast bureaucracy and acquire companies,
buildings, hotels, fleets of cars and garages. The government has
said it has no plans to recover property, however.
   The best-known Soviet case involved Yuri Churbanov, son-in-law
of the late Kremlin leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. Churbanov, former
deputy interior minister, was convicted a year ago of taking bribes
and is serving a 12-year prison term.
   The current leaders are fanning popular resentment of
corruption, in part to deflect any criticism of them.
   ``The whole thing is being played up,'' says Guenther Buch, a
West German government expert on East German affairs. ``Certainly,
people knew about it. But before, people were punished if they
started talking.''
   ``Now they're venting their anger,'' he said.
   Buch said he fears the resentment could turn into violence,
especially if there are disclosures of corruption in the middle and
lower levels of the Communist Party.
   In an interview with the Communist newspaper Junge Welt,
opposition leader Rainer Eppelmann said he believes there also are
cases of corruption in the four parties long allied with the
Communists.
   The former head of one of those parties, the Christian
Democrats, already is under investigation for unspecified financial
irregularities.
   Part of East Germany's anti-corruption campaign is in the hands
of a commission headed by new Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi.
   Gysi, a 41-year-old lawyer, has promised to uncover all abuse
but has cautioned against ``tearing ourselves to pieces.''
   One of the best-known cases of corruption so far is that of
Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, wanted for overseeing a ring that
sold weapons to countries in South America, Africa and the Middle
East.
   The former top-ranking government official is in a West Berlin
prison and says he will fight any extradition attempts.
   He has said he was repaying about $30 million to East Germany
from Swiss bank accounts, but that is only a small part of what the
nation's official news media claim he embezzled.
   ``Schalck-Golodkowski is worried he'll be sacrificed if he is
sent back,'' says his West Berlin lawyer, Peter Danckert.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived Sunday for a historic two-day visit to visit
NATO headquarters and sign a trade and economic cooperation accord
with the European Community.
   Shevardnadze was greeted at Abelag Airport by Belgian Foreign
Minister Mark Eyskens. He made no statement upon arrival.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnadze will pay a 90-minute visit to the
headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for talks
with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner and the ambassadors of
the member nations.
   Officials have said there is no fixed agenda for the talks at
alliance headquarters and have described it as a courtesy call that
is indicative of the new East-West climate.
   On Monday, Shevardnadze will meet with the foreign ministers of
the 12-nation EC trade bloc and sign a cooperation agreement.
   He also will meet separately with Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens and King Baudouin and will discuss the reforms
sweeping acrosss Eastern Europe with government ministers during a
meeting that will continue over lunch.
   The economic agreement with the EC was concluded Nov. 27 and
provides for a gradual lifting of EC import quotas on Soviet
industrial goods by 1995.
   The accord also lists a dozen areas in which the EC and the
Soviet Union plan to establish economic cooperation. These include
science and technology, banking, transport, agriculture,
environmental protection, energy, raw materials and mining.
   The accord excludes trade in goods that are considered
militarily sensitive, according to EC sources.
   The EC-Soviet accord is the fourth between the community and an
East European nation since the EC and the Moscow-led Comecon trade
bloc signed a mutual recognition accord June 25, 1988.
   Since then the EC has concluded trade and economic cooperation
accords with the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The EC's trade with Eastern Europe is small. It totalled only
$56 billion in 1987, the last year for which complete figures are
available and about half of that was with the Soviet Union.
   By comparison, the EC's trade with Switzerland that year was
some $66 billion.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Says US Negotiating Controls With Hungary, Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States has started negotiations
with Poland and Hungary aimed at preventing diversion to the Soviet
Union of U.S. high-technology exports to those two East European
countries, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Sunday
   Mosbacher's remarks came a day after President Bush signaled
that his administration is ready to consider a major relaxation of
export controls with regard to Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``I think it is timely that we take a new look at the commercial
restraints,'' Bush said Saturday at a news conference on the
Caribbean island of St. Martin after meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Mosbacher, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program, was
asked about a pending request by the Control Data Corp. to sell
several high-powered computers to the Soviet Union.
   The commerce secretary responded that ``we'll have to look at
each item on a case-by-case basis.''
   ``We released middle technology and we're going to look to see
whether it should go higher than that,'' Mosbacher said. ``Eastern
European countries, yes; the Soviet Union, we'd have to be very
careful.''
   Later in the program, Mosbacher was asked how the United States
could be confident that high-technology items exported to Poland
and Hungary, which remain members of the Warsaw Pact, would not end
up in Soviet hands.
   He replied: ``Well, because both of them have started
negotiations with us on verification and continuing observation on
what they do with whatever we send them. And it would be on that
condition and that we make that negotiation a reality that we would
send them these things so that there couldn't be transshipment.''
   Mosbacher also was questioned about the announcement Friday that
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit had surged to $10.2 billion in
October, the biggest deficit in 10 months.
   The commerce secretary replied that he did not believe the
October figure spelled bad news for longer-term efforts to help
reduce the trade deficit.
   Mosbacher said he expects the U.S. trade imbalance for all of
1989 will total about $110 billion, down from approximately $120
billion last year.
   ``We're chipping away at it _ not fast enough, but we're working
on it,'' he said.

<HEAD>US, China Discuss Release of 2 Dissidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and China are discussing the
release of Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian,
to a third country, a published report said Sunday.
   The discussions about a possible release of Fang occurred as a
result of private talks that former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger held in Beijing last month, The Washington Post said,
quoting an anonymous Bush administration source.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft followed up on those
talks last weekend when he and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger met with officials in Beijing on a much-criticized
surprise mission, the newspaper said.
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger are former business partners of
Kissinger's in a consulting firm that has clients in China.
Kissinger has been involved with China since the Nixon
administration, which paved the way for a reopening of relations
between the two countries. Former President Nixon visited China in
late October.
   Fang and Li have taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
since the Chinese government's bloody crackdown in June on the
democracy movement. The suppression culminated in the killing of
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people at Tiananmen Square.
   The recent U.S. overture, including a toast by Scowcroft to the
Chinese leaders who led the crackdown, has been criticized in the
United States. Some lawmakers have threatened to seek sanctions
against China when Congress returns in January.
   President Bush, however, said Saturday in St. Martin that he had
seen ``a couple of indications'' that the visit would have
``positive results.'' He did not elaborate.
   Bush made the remarks after a meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   According to the official quoted in the Post, China's leaders
have said they would not release Fang to the United States or
France. Both countries host numbers of Chinese student dissidents.
   The official said the United States ``wants to get him out of
there'' and the search is continuing for a compromise, the Post
reported.
   Kissinger, appearing Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
declined to comment on his discussions.
   But he did say: ``I would expect that over the next four to six
weeks it will be obvious that the human rights issue was not put on
the back burner and that important considerations with respect to
human rights were raised.''
   Asked if there were a conflict of interest between his business
interests and his private diplomacy, Kissinger said: ``Well, the
funny thing is that I'm trying to keep the list of my clients
confidential for that very reason, that I don't want to raise
conflict-of-interest questions, and others are trying to make me _
get me to make them public, because our client list is not revealed
to the governments concerned.''
   He added, ``My opinions are not for sale.''

<HEAD>Panel to Explore `Roots' of Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal-plagued Department of Housing and
Urban Development must establish ``a new level of credibility''
before Congress will back significant new housing programs,
according to the head of a Senate panel that plans a new probe of
the department.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., chairman of the newly appointed
subcommittee on HUD investigations, said multibillion-dollar abuses
uncovered at HUD during the Reagan administration are the result of
deep-rooted problems in the way the agency's housing subsidy
programs are structured.
   He said his panel will open hearings soon after Congress
reconvenes in January aimed at finding ways to change federal
housing subsidies for the poor to make influence-peddling and
mismanagement more difficult and more detectible.
   ``It may be that the plunder reached new heights during the
Pierce era, but it is not by any means the first time there have
been scandals similar to those that have come out in the last few
months,'' Graham said, referring to former HUD Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr.
   ``Our approach is going to be one of trying to understand and
legislate on why these programs of HUD have been so subject to
plunder for an extended period of time,'' Graham said.
   ``Clearly, the original objectives of these programs is not
being achieved.''
   Graham's investigative panel was appointed by Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich. He commented in a recent
interview in his office during the congressional recess.
   Graham contended that a package of management reforms proposed
by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and enacted by Congress as one of its
final actions before recessing for the year did not end all the
potential for abuse in housing laws.
   He said developers continue to be able to ``layer'' their
federal subsidies from HUD, combining multifamily housing grants
with other subsidies, including low-income housing tax credits.
   Graham is among the Senate cosponsors of a bill that would
overhaul most housing programs aimed to benefit low-income people,
and which has been pushed strongly by advocates of increased
federal housing aid.
   That legislation did not advance during this year's session, and
Graham suggested it was unlikely to move until his panel makes its
report.
   ``There has to be a new level of credibility in the department
and in the programs before it is likely the Congress will support
significant new housing initiatives,'' Graham said.
   Still, the Senate committee's move to investigate HUD has raised
questions about its timing and motives, since furor over the fraud,
influence-peddling and mismanagement at HUD seems to be fading
after first gaining attention last spring.
   A House subcommittee headed by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,
conducted nearly 30 hearings over eight months. It subpoenaed
Pierce and his former aides _ prompting Pierce and three others to
refuse to testify on grounds of self-incrimination. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh has begun a preliminary inquiry into
whether a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate
Pierce.
   Graham's probe also comes as Kemp has voiced anger at Congress
for appropriating millions of dollars to specific HUD projects that
the department's own staff says is unnecessary or wasteful.
   Talbot ``Sandy'' D'Alemberte, a Florida attorney hired by Graham
to lead the panel's staff, said the probe would not focus on the
scandal's ``rats,'' as the Lantos probe did, and would not create
the sensation that the House panel did with its parade of witnesses
invoking 5th Amendment rights.
   D'Alemberte is a former dean of the Florida State University Law
School and president-elect of the American Bar Association.
   Graham said his panel would focus instead on ``vulnerability''
to abuse in housing laws and probably would not try to compel
testimony from witnesses who have refused before the Lantos panel.
He said it would conclude hearings in 60 to 90 days.

   More than 800 aging, old-time
Communists reaffirmed their loyalty to a hard-line ideology Sunday
at a meeting to reorganize the party, which reformers disbanded two
months ago.
   Communist reformers declared the old party dead on Oct. 8 and
formed the Hungarian Socialist Party.
   Former general secretary Karoly Grosz denounced the move as a
``coup.''
   Grosz and other leading conservatives since have tried to
reassemble like-minded Communists, asserting that the old party _
officially known as the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party _ still
exists.
   The tone of Sunday's session was set by Gyoergy Marosan, 82, who
told the gathering in a voice choked with emotion: ``I am glad I
don't have to begin by saying `ladies and Gentlemen' because we are
all comrades here.''
   The delegates responded with deafening applause.
   The old Communist Party had more than 750,000 members and they
have not been allowed to join the new party unless they sign a
declaration reflecting support for democratic reforms similar to
those taking place in other Eastern European countries.
   Marosan urged efforts to avoid ``fratricide,'' referring to the
split. ``No one can sweep Marxism off the table of history,'' he
told the cheering audience.
   In his keynote speech, Grosz declared that the Communist Party
``is alive because members want it that way'' and said it had about
100,000 members.
   He attacked the new government's economic plans, which are
similar to his when he was premier 18 months ago, and warned
against ``capitalist restoration.''
   Grosz announced that the committee that organized the
conservatives was resigning and urged the delegates to elect ``new
faces, new personalities into the leadership.''
   That organizing committee had been an uneasy alliance of former
government leaders. It included former Communist ideologist Janos
Berecz, one-time Foreign Minister Frigyes Puja and Robert
Ribanszki, a former personal secretary of the late party chief
Janos Kadar.
   A strong candidate to lead the party is Gyula Thuermer, Grosz's
former foreign policy adviser.

   More than 38,000 members of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints are expected to participate in
dedication services for a new $18 million Mormon temple here.
   The dedication services, which will continue through Monday,
began Saturday with church president Ezra Taft Benson heading a
delegation that presided over the ceremonies.
   The 192-room Las Vegas temple is the church's 43rd operating
temple.
   Some 300 church members attended services in the temple's
Celestial Room Saturday, while another 3,100 members watched via 50
closed-circuit television monitors in rooms throughout the temple.
   Benson was accompanied by his church counselors, Gordon Hinckley
and Thomas Monson. Hinckley said Las Vegas Valley Mormons had
exceeded by 300 percent the amount of money they were asked to
contribute to the temple.
   An estimated 90,000 Mormons live in Nevada, nearly 10 percent of
the state's population.

   For Czechoslovak journalists, the
whirlwind revolution of the past month has set them free from the
dictates of ideology but left them grappling with the constraints
of the marketplace.
   ``What we need is an editor who is a humanist, a visionary, a
person with a clear moral point of view. But we also want someone
who is hardworking and aggressive, a manager who knows how to get
us a new printing press,'' said Michal Horacek, a reporter on the
mass circulation weekly Mlady Svet and a member of the opposition
group Civic Forum.
   Among the first acts of the new opposition-approved government
sworn in Dec. 10 was the firing of the official state censor. Last
Monday, reporters at Mlady Svet, who were required by unwritten
rule to be party members, celebrated the new government by
destroying their membership cards.
   Even the Communist Party dailies Rude Pravo and Pravda now carry
news. Instead of Pablum and propaganda, each day's pages offer
reports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police and
corruption in the highest party circles.
   It's a big change from only a month ago when editors made weekly
visits to the Communist Party press office to hear about the
previous week's ``errors'' and receive ``advice'' that was passed
along to the staff.
   Offensive passages were deleted, offensive publications
confiscated before they hit the street and some journalists who
operated too far from the party line, like those editing
underground journals, wound up behind bars.
   ``The people of this country were trained to read between the
lines,'' said Horacek, whose column ``Letters of Love and Hate''
was addressed to dead heroes but with a political message that was
clear to Czechoslovak cognoscente.
   When information was strictly controlled, every text had a
sub-text, every word a hidden meaning. People knew better than to
believe what they read and literature became a refuge from reality.
   In this way, the traditionally important role of writers and
other intellectuals in Eastern Europe was enhanced. Cultural
variety substituted for political plurality, and the censor and the
written word both carried enormous weight in the battle for
readers' minds.
   Now, the rules of this Kafkaesque game have changed.
   ``What was only suggested before can now be said, and this means
we have to be more accurate, more tolerant and we have to learn to
compete in the marketplace,'' said Lubos Beniaka, Horacek's
colleague, who wrote 121 pages for his newspaper on the
pro-democracy demonstrations that began Nov. 17 and will end in
free elections next year.
   ``We are quite in the dark about what we are going to be,'' he
said.
   Whatever it is, newspaper staffs will have to decide quickly
since state subsidies in a democratic system will disappear.
   Reporters throughout Prague, exhausted by the non-stop coverage
of fast-breaking events but exhilarated by new opportunities, are
spending much time in meetings discussing their fate.
   ``We can be bought by Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch now,''
Horacek said. ``Anything can happen. But, above all, we want to be
independent. And now we are asking, would we be independent in Mr.
Murdoch's world?''

   The government's efforts to rebound
after the recent failed coup have largely consisted of rhetoric,
partly because of a political system designed to check presidential
action.
   It is widely assumed that President Corazon Aquino must make
sweeping changes in her administration and leadership style if the
nation is to recover from the political, economic and social damage
caused by the Dec. 1-9 military mutiny that nearly ousted her.
   More than a week after the last rebel surrendered, there have
been no Cabinet changes. She seems to have delayed action so it
does not appear that she bowed to the mutineers' demands for
change, including an end to government corruption and inefficiency.
   There also have been no major domestic policy reforms. But the
Philippine political system, which Mrs. Aquino proudly describes as
a ``restored democracy,'' is not designed for speedy action.
   It was designed to divide power among the executive, legislative
and judicial branches after 20 years of strongman rule under the
late President Ferdinand Marcos. For better or worse, the Aquino
administration and citizens are discovering what that means in time
of crisis.
   In a bid to restore public confidence, Mrs. Aquino declared a
state of national emergency on Dec. 6. The declaration exists in
name only, however, because Congress has not ratified the final
version of a bill spelling out what Ms. Aquino would be empowered
to do during a state of emergency.
   The Senate and House of Representatives planned to take up the
legislation on Monday.
   It would grant few new powers beyond price controls, state
operation of public utilities and recovery of ``loose firearms.''
   Congress amended the original proposal to require adherence to
the constitution, language that virtually guarantees court
challenges if the legislation passes.
   For example, the compromise bill would not allow the government
to arrest suspects without warrants or circumvent other legal
restraints. Lawmakers also have weakened proposed curbs on the
right to strike and media reporting.
   The idea of emergency powers has been severely criticized by
people with bitter memories of martial law, which Marcos imposed
from 1972 until 1981.
   ``We see a repeat of the Marcos regime,'' wrote columnist Neal
Cruz in the Philippine Daily Globe. ``Marcos refused to heed
appeals for reform. Instead, he declared a state of emergency, then
imposed martial law. ... Now that housewife is turning out to be
another Marcos.''
   In the heady days after the 1986 ``people power revolution''
that toppled the Marcos administration, Mrs. Aquino appointed a
commission to draft a new constitution to guarantee no more
one-person rule.
   The commission restored the two-house legislature precisely
because Marcos had been successful in transforming a single-house
National Assembly into a rubber-stamp chamber.
   Last week, the system seemed to work: Congress refused to give
the administration everything it wanted.
   The president is constitutionally empowered to declare a state
of emergency ``and under reasonable terms ... temporarily take over
or direct the operations of any privately owned public utility or
business affected by the public interest.'' No other specific
powers are cited.
   Even if she declared martial law, Mrs. Aquino would hardly have
a free legal hand.
   The constitution stipulates that martial law ``does not suspend
the operation of the constitution'' or the operations of Congress
and the courts.
   Mrs Aquino could order arrest without warrants for 60 days but
Congress is empowered to overrule such a decree after 48 hours.
   One step that she could take would be to dismiss her Cabinet,
which had been widely criticized as ineffective months before the
coup attempt.
   Presidential staff sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
say Mrs. Aquino was preparing to drop some Cabinet members but did
not plan a massive shake-up because she believes much of the
criticism is unfair.

   Robert S. Vance was remembered by
friends and colleagues as a thoughtful federal appeals court judge,
who earlier helped heal racial wounds that threatened to destroy
the Alabama Democratic Party.
   Vance, 58, a judge on the Atlanta-based U.S. 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals, was killed by a mail bomb that went off at his home
Saturday afternoon. His wife, Helen, was seriously injured.
   ``He was a voice of sanity in turbulent times and a leader of
reasoned action,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who met Vance
more than 30 years ago when they were young trial lawyers.
``Alabama and America's jurisprudence has suffered a tremendous
loss.''
   In 1977, then-President Carter appointed Vance, a former
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, to serve as a member of
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He later was assigned to the
new 11th Circuit, which reviews appeals from trial-level federal
courts in Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
   As a judge, Vance did not receive the attention that his party
chairmanship had given him, but he did have a hand in some cases
heavily publicized regionally.
   ``Bob was intellectually brilliant,'' said Huntsville attorney
Julian Butler, a longtime friend. ``He had an incredibly innovative
mind but was realistic and pragmatic. ... He understood the
realities of politics.''
   Vance, a student body president at the University of Alabama,
first gained statewide notice with his efforts to get the Alabama
Legislature to redraw legislative districts to reflect changes in
population in the early 1960s.
   At that time, the State Democratic Executive Committee was under
the control of a staunchly conservative coalition of states' rights
advocates and Dixiecrats loyal to then-segregationist Gov. George
C. Wallace.
   Vance, then a young lawyer, became the champion for loyalist
Democrats who were afraid that Wallace's growing influence would
cause a split with the national Democratic party.
   The Talladega native was elected state party chairman in 1966
and won re-election twice over the next 11 years. He soon began the
political wrangling necessary to fully integrate the all-white
state Democratic party.
   ``He was just such a fine example of what the Democratic party
needed for leadership,'' former state Sen. George Lewis Bailes
said. ``He was very pro-people, pro-Democrat.''
   ``Bob Vance, more than any other human being in Alabama, was
responsible for keeping the Democratic Party in Alabama a
democratic party,'' Butler said.
   One of Vance's first moves as party chairman was to bring about
the removal of the white rooster _ a symbol of white supremacy with
the slogan ``For the Right'' _ from atop the party's election
ballots.
   ``He felt like we had to move forward out of the racial unrest
we were in,'' Heflin said. ``He believed we ought to approach these
things, not draw a line in the dust.''
   Wallace unsuccessfully challenged Vance's leadership of the
party numerous times, backing candidates he thought could unseat
the chairman.
   Vance never held an elected office other than his party
chairmanship and seat on State Democratic Executive Committee. But
his tenure saw some other changes that left their impact on Alabama
politics.
   The party pushed vigorously for election law reform and later
adopted a rule requiring its candidates to disclose their finances
before the party primary elections.
   Vance was survived by his wife of 36 years and by two sons,
Robert S. Vance Jr. and Charles Vance.

   East Germany's premier says his nation is
willing to change its policy of denying responsibility for the Nazi
Holocaust as a way to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``We have approached Israel officially with a request to discuss
establishing diplomatic relations,'' Premier Hans Modrow was quoted
as saying in an interview published in the daily Haaretz.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told Israel radio Sunday that
officials had not received a formal East German request for
diplomatic relations. But he welcomed what he called growing signs
of ``repentance'' by Soviet bloc nations for unwavering support for
the Arab world.
   Many East bloc countries that broke ties with Israel after the
1967 Middle East war recently have expressed interest in renewing
relations.
   But Israel never has had diplomatic ties with East Germany,
which has maintained that it bore no responsibility for the
Holocaust because the nation did not exist at the time.
   The Nazis killed about 6 million Jews before Germany was
defeated in World War II and divided into two states.
   When Modrow was asked about payments to Holocaust survivors, he
told Haaretz: ``We are certainly prepared to discuss the issue with
official representatives of the Jewish organizations dealing with
it and of Israel.''
   East German Deputy Foreign Minister Heinz-Dieter Winter said
last week that his country would discuss ``humanitarian
assistance'' but not war reparations.
   Motti Amichai, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
said that would not be enough.
   ``What we want is very clearly the acceptance of responsibility,
and if you accept the responsibility, then you need to pay
reparations,'' Amichai said.
   The Holocaust still is a deeply painful issue in Israeli
society, but many believe that establishing ties with East Germany
would not cause the riots that erupted when Israel began diplomatic
relations with West Germany in 1965.
   Shevach Weiss, a left-wing legislator and Holocaust survivor,
said in a telephone interview Sunday: ``Forty-five years after the
war the population of East Germany is made up of young people. Most
Israelis understand that you have to have relations with East
Germany, especially after having ties with West Germany.''
   Weiss said, however, that Israel should insist that East Germany
accept responsibility for the Holocaust and pay reparations.
   Since 1952, West Germany has paid more than $43 billion in
reparations to Holocaust survivors and their families.
   Newly elected East German Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi
also told Haaretz he expects his nation to establish diplomatic
ties with Israel.
   ``We are interested in ties with Israel in all fields, including
of course diplomatic relations,'' he said. ``This doesn't mean we
agree with Israel on every issue, but we have relations with many
countries that we disagree with.''

   Tens of thousands of students
marched on Sunday and hundreds attended a special Mass to
commemorate a rally a month ago that turned violent, shocked the
country and triggered a peaceful revolution.
   Roman Catholic priest Vaclav Maly, who was stripped of his state
license to preach for signing a human rights charter, addressed
about 1,000 people under the baroque, vaulted ceiling of St.
Margaret's Basilica.
   Hundreds of Roman Catholic faithful who could not get inside
stood in the rain to hear Maly's first public Mass in 11 years.
   The Mass was dedicated to a peaceful student rally Nov. 17
organized to honor a student killed by the Nazis 50 years ago. The
rally ended when club-swinging police attacked the students, and
143 people were injured.
   Czechoslovakia exploded in the weeks that followed, with
hundreds of thousands of people pouring into the streets demanding
democratic reform. The embattled Communists surrendered their
41-year monopoly on power, swore in a new government dominated by
non-Communists and promised free elections.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe on Sunday:
   _The East German Communist Party called for a ``human,
democratic socialism'' and stressed its opposition to German
reunification as an emergency congress ended. The party adopted a
new platform designed to guide it until a regular congress in
February.
   _Poland's Solidarity-led government introduced radical economic
legislation in an effort to break monopolies, cut subsidies,
privatize industry and curb 900 percent inflation.
   _Some 800 mostly elderly delegates of Hungary's Communist Party
held a congress in Budapest in an effort to reorganize the party,
which was disbanded Oct. 8 and transformed into the Hungarian
Socialist Party.
   _Romanian police clashed with thousands of anti-government
demonstrators over the weekend after authorities tried to deport a
dissident clergyman, the Hungarian state news agency and other
sources said Sunday.
   After the Mass in Prague, students retraced the three-mile path
of the Nov. 17 march, walking to Vysehrad Cemetery and cathedral
and winding through Prague's historic streets for a rally at
Wenceslas Square.
   About 100,000 people marched, many carrying candles and banners
saying ``Havel for President'' and chanting ``Long live Havel!''
   Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel is the opposition Civic
Forum's candidate for president, a largely ceremonial but symbolic
post. Hard-line President Gustav Husak resigned one week ago.
   The students paused for a moment of silence and to light candles
at the site of the police charges.
   Bystanders cheered and applauded as the marchers headed slowly
to Wenceslas Square through clogged streets.
   ``We are just so grateful to the students for what they did to
bring about this change,'' said an elderly woman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It's such a terrible shame that our generation was not able to
do the same thing.''
   Havel was reported Saturday to have reached an agreement with
the other main presidential contender, Alexander Dubcek, in which
Dubcek would accept another top post and Havel would become
president. But Dubcek, who engineered the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
crushed by the Soviet-led invasion in 1968, was quoted as telling
an Italian newspaper on Saturday that he remains interested in
becoming president.
   Havel, in a televised speech Saturday night, said, ``We are all
grateful to the students for having given the revolution its
beautiful, dignified, peaceful, and I daresay, affectionate face
that is now admired by the whole world.
   ``It was a revolt of the truth against the lie, of purity
against filth, of the human heart against violence.''
   At the start of Sunday's Mass, Maly was bathed in television
spotlights as he received a one-minute ovation.
   Switching from Czech to English halfway through his sermon, Maly
said:
   ``You can experience here an alive church that ... doesn't wish
to master, to rule society, but a searching church, searching for
God's truth.''
   The service ended with voices raised in the haunting hymn of St.
Wenceslas, patron saint of Bohemia, and Czechoslovakia's national
anthem. One by one, the crowd slowly raised their hands in the
now-familiar sign of victory.
   Under Communist rule, the Roman Catholic Church struggled to
serve the nation's estimated 9.3 million Catholics, who comprise 60
percent of the population.
   Maly, like many of his fellow priests, could not preach or hold
services without a government license. Communist authorities
refused to approve many of the men proposed by the Vatican to fill
bishoprics.
   Bishoprics fell vacant and remained so. Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, 90, remained spiritual leader despite his age out of fear
he might not be replaced.
   Maly was stripped of his license to preach after signing the
Charter 77 human rights document. He held services illegally in his
cramped apartment for laymen who faced discrimination for their
Christian beliefs.
   Now, Maly's name is being mentioned as a replacement for Tomasek.

<HEAD>Pioneer in Diabetes Research Dies at 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Priscilla White, whose research
sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic
women, died at age 89 after a long illness.
   White died Saturday at her home in this Boston suburb, according
to a statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
   Her studies identified ways to decrease the risk of maternal and
child death in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, the statement
said.
   White's research and the treatment process she developed
increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54
percent in the 1920s to about 97 percent in the late 1970s and
1980s, it said.
   Born in Boston, White attended Radcliffe College and graduated
third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.
   She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and
in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the
clinic now known as the Joslin Diabetes Center.
   White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant
professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors, and
was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American
Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.
   In her research, White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother
often would be healthy a month before delivery but would die if
allowed to go full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic
women should be delivered by Caesarean section at eight months.
   She gradually discovered that babies could remain in the womb an
extra week to develop. She also learned that although infants of
diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size
despite premature birth, they require the same special care needed
for premature infants.

<HEAD>Couple in Kidnap, Rape and Murder Appeared to be Randomly Picked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men kidnapped a couple at a drive-in
theater, raped and killed the woman and viciously beat her
boyfriend before dumping him in an alley, authorities said.
   There were no arrests in the case Sunday, and Los Angeles County
Sheriff's deputies said the attackers apparently picked their
victims at random.
   ``They're animals,'' sheriff's Detective Joe Barnes said of the
assailants. There was no sign that drugs or gangs were involved, he
added.
   ``That's the scary part,'' he said. ``It can be you and your
wife. You and your girlfriend.''
   Detectives on Saturday found the body of Irene Franco, 20, who
was kidnapped at gunpoint with boyfriend Jesus Martinez, 26, from a
six-screen complex about 17 miles south of Los Angeles.
   Martinez, who was left bloodied and bludgeoned in an alley,
called authorities from a pay telephone after the men drove off
with his girlfriend, sheriff's Deputy Dean Scoville said.
   Martinez told authorities he and Ms. Franco were watching a
movie at the theater late Friday when a man wielding a pistol
walked up to the car and ordered the couple into the back seat as
two other men hopped in. Martinez said neither he nor his
girlfriend knew the assailants.
   The men tied up the couple and ordered them to keep their heads
down, authorities said. The gunmen drove the car to an alley and
beat and raped Ms. Franco as they took turns beating Martinez,
using a board they apparently found nearby, Scoville said.
   ``When they weren't assaulting the girl they were assaulting
(Martinez),'' Scoville said.
   Martinez, a construction worker from the Los Angeles suburb of
Gardena, was bound with electrical cord before the men drove off
with Ms. Franco.
   They shouted something like, ``Don't worry about your
girlfriend. we'll drop her off in a few minutes,'' Scoville said.
   Ms. Franco, a Mexican immigrant living in Wilmington, died of a
gunshot wound to the back of the head, Scoville said.
   A 13-year-old boy playing with a cousin spotted the woman's
badly beaten body Saturday morning in a field several miles from
the drive-in. Authorities did not identify her body positively
until 5 p.m., Scoville said.
   Martinez was taken to a hospital, treated for numerous injuries
and released. The couple's car was found abandoned at a third
location, where it had been set afire, he said.
   Detectives were trying to locate witnesses from the drive-in but
had been unable to find anyone who saw the assault, Scoville said.
   The murder shocked members of Ms. Franco's parish in Wilmington,
where the Rev. Luis Valbuena worked to arrange for her relatives in
Mexico to come to Los Angeles to make funeral arrangements.
   ``Nothing makes sense,'' Valbuena said. ``This is the time
before Christmas. It has to make you think, `Where are we going?' ''
   He described Ms. Franco, a regular churchgoer, as ``very
beautiful, very religious.''

   Blustery winds and fresh snow frustrated
rescue workers searching for a twin-engine airplane that
disappeared during a snowstorm with six people aboard, authorities
said Sunday.
   About 20 airplanes and helicopters were searching a four-county
area of the Catskill Mountains for the Piper Navajo that apparently
crashed Friday night, state police Sgt. John Vansteenburg said in
Catskill.
   Darkness forced rescuers to call off the search until Monday
morning, trooper Robert Carl said.
   ``We've found no sign,'' said Lt. George Ezzo, who is heading a
team of forest rangers in the search. Rescuers gave up searching on
foot because the plane ``could be anywhere along a 100-mile line,''
he said.
   The airplane took off Friday afternoon from Warren County
Airport, 50 miles north of Albany, bound for Orange County Airport
just north of New York City, said Civil Air Patrol spokeswoman Ann
MacMillan. It was reported about 30 miles south of Albany when it
disappeared, she said.
   The plane took off in blustery weather, and as much as 7 inches
of snow fell in the area. Although skies were clear Sunday, snow
that has fallen since Friday may have buried the plane,
Vansteenburg said.
   Salvatore Arlotta, a vice president of the Middletown-based
environmental consulting firm Wehran Engineering, and Peter Lovi, a
scientist for the company, were returning from a trip to a landfill
project northeast of Glens Falls, said Wehran spokeswoman Phyllis
Phegn.
   Authorities have not released the names of the pilot or the
other three passengers.

<HEAD>Record Cold Moves Into Virginias, Heavy Snow in New York State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Arctic air drifted further east Sunday, breaking low-temperature
records from the Midwest to the Virginias and casting frost across
northern Florida, and another wave of cold air was expected to move
into Wyoming.
   Snow was widespread, stretching from northern Maine to parts of
the Great Lakes, covering parts of the northern Plains and Rockies,
and reaching south to Arkansas and Tennessee.
   The official low temperature for the Lower 48 states Sunday
morning was 17 degrees below zero at Lewisburg, Va., but smaller
communities in West Virginia and southwest Virginia reported much
lower temperatures. In West Virginia, Greenbank reached 26 below
and Seneca State Forest hit 23 below, while Burkes Garden, Va., had
a low of 19 below zero.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set or tied in at
least 22 cities in 11 states because of the arctic air mass
centered over the lower Ohio Valley. Six new records were set in
Ohio, including 12 degrees below zero Columbus, 10 below in
Youngstown, 9 below in Cincinnati and 7 below in Cleveland.
   Other new records included minus 2 degrees in Charleston, W.Va.,
minus 7 in Detroit, 10 below in Indianapolis, 11 below in Fort
Wayne, Ind., minus 6 in Lexington, Ky., and minus 5 in Springfield,
Ill.
   The cold also persisted in Honolulu, where the early morning low
of 57 degrees tied the record for the date set in 1980.
   Northern Florida got frost and freezing temperatures Sunday
morning, with lows of 26 degrees at Crestview and Tallahassee, 30
at Pensacola and 31 at Gainesville.
   Cold weather also was expected to move into Southern California.
A frost advisory was posted for the San Diego area, with lows
expected to drop to around 27 degrees in nearby agricultural areas
Sunday night.
   Another surge of snow and lower temperatures was forecast to
move into Wyoming on Sunday night, dropping temperatures to as low
as 15 below zero. Monday's highs were expected to be between zero
and 15 degrees above zero. From 3 to 6 inches of snow was forecast
for the mountains and 1 to 3 inches elsewhere in the state.
   Early Sunday afternoon, snow was falling in sections of Maine,
New York state, Tennessee, Michigan, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa,
Minnesota, the Dakotas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and eastern
Washington state.
   A snow squall warning remained in effect in parts of western New
York state southeast of Lake Ontario. Hancock has received 2 feet
of snow since Friday, and another 6 inches or more were expected.
   Heavy snow caused authorities to extend an avalanche alert in
the Rockies of northern Colorado Sunday. The area has received 2 to
5 feet of snow over the past week and there were at least two dozen
avalanches on Saturday, Nick Logan of the state's Avalanche
Information Center in Denver said.
   Skiers rejoiced, though, particularly at Steamboat Springs where
the resort reported a 59-inch snow depth. ``It's good powder skiing
_ soft powder skiing,'' said Joe Puchek of Gunnison.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 4
inches at Pellston, Mich., and Syracuse, N.Y., 3 inches at
Muskegon, Mich., and 1 inch at Rome, N.Y.
   Sleet and light snow was falling in north-central and west
Texas, causing hazardous road conditions, and rain was falling on
the central Texas Gulf coast.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 10 degrees below zero at
the Air Force base near Grand Forks, N.D., to 79 degrees at Miami
and Fort Myers, Fla.

<HEAD>Opposition Scores in Portuguese Local Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opposition Socialist Party claimed
major victories in local voting Sunday with the election of its
leader as mayor of Lisbon and the capture of other large cities and
government strongholds.
   The governing, center-right Social Democrats of Prime Minister
Anibal Cavaco Silva received most votes nationwide when initial
results were announced, winning an estimated 40 percent of the
vote, according to state RTP television.
   However, the loss of Lisbon, Oporto in the north, the major
cities of Coimbra and Faro, and Social Democratic strongholds on
Madeira and in the Azores islands were hailed as triumphs by the
opposition.
   ``This is a clear defeat for the government and the Social
Democratic Party on a national scale _ and the Lisbon result shows
the capital doesn't even trust the ministries it houses,''
Socialist Party leader Jorge Sampaio told a news conference at his
party headquarters.
   Three hours after polling stations closed, about 35 percent of
the vote was reported as having gone to the Socialists, 11 percent
to the conservative Democratic Social Center and 9 percent to the
Communists. No vote totals were available.
   Sampaio won in Lisbon as candidate of an unprecedented alliance
between Socialists and Communists that won from 48 to 50 percent of
the city vote.
   His conservative opponent, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, admitted
defeat after hearing first estimates.
   Shortly after initial results were announced, Socialist Party
spokesman Antonio Lopes Cardoso said Sampaio would not join forces
with the Communists in the next legislative elections slated for
1991.
   The Social Democrats had warned that a leftist victory in Lisbon
could tempt the Socialists to maintain the alliance in general
elections and so let the Communists into the federal government by
the back door.
   The government has slipped in popularity since winning
Portugal's first absolute majority in 1987 on the promise of
free-market economic policies and rapid modernization.
   A consumer boom and big foreign investment have brought
prosperity to some, but annual inflation of more than 12 percent
has squeezed low-income budgets.
   Persistent rumors of high-level corruption also plagued the
Social Democrats.
   About 8 million Portuguese were eligible to vote in elections
for 55,000 local authorities.
   Voting in Cunha Alta in the northern region of Mangulade was
postponed until Sunday, Dec. 24, after strong winds ripped roofs
off houses and injured at least two people, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.

   Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief
Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei
D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as
his country's conscience.
   Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks _ two of the groups
Sakharov helped _ joined rank-and-file Communists, teachers and
engineers in filing past the body of the physicist, Nobel Peace
Prize winner, human rights advocate and legislator.
   Based on official sources, an estimated 45,000 people filed
through, and the flow of mourners continued into the night. A
friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
heard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it was
returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight.
   ``My God! Forgive us!'' one elderly woman cried out as she saw
Sakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of the
beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow. She apparently meant
to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier.
   A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's
feet, and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov
with his hands over his mouth, deep in thought. An organ and piano
alternated dirges.
   Sakharov died Thursday alone in his study at the age of 68,
apparently of a heart attack, ending a three-decade fight against
the jailing of innocent people, for free emigration, for
disarmament and other causes.
   Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies, and the
outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and
committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote
city of Gorky.
   There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9
million people, as though a government leader had died. The huge
line of mourners, sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against
below-zero temperatures, stretched a mile from the palace and
poured continuously out of a subway station.
   So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that
authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the
coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.
   Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a member of the official funeral commission,
said about 3,000 people an hour were arriving initially, but the
official news agency Tass said that rate doubled later, making for
a total of 45,000 by nighttime.
   Police lined the sidewalks where people waited. Sakharov's widow
Yelena Bonner, pleased authorities were not turning people away,
praised them for being ``very democratic.''
   In her first detailed public comments on her husband's death,
Bonner said she hopes he will not be idolized.
   ``I would not wish a living person _ he has lived an animated,
happy life _ to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be used
by various forces in their interests,'' Bonner said in an interview
broadcast on Soviet TV.
   She said, however, that she hopes Sakharov's writings, published
abroad long ago, will become widely available in his homeland so
there can be a conversation of ``the people of the future with
Andrei Dmitrievich.''
   Mourners carried small portraits of Sakharov and red and white
carnations to place near his coffin. One man, Sergei Kosykh,
brought his 7-year-old daughter along.
   ``My daughter, who is being brought up with the belief that
there is nobody greater than (Soviet founder Vladimir) Lenin, I
have brought her here today just to show her the person greater
than Lenin,'' he said.
   A middle-aged woman drew from Russian literature to reflect on
Sakharov's contributions.
   ``He was like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tales who used
his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to
light and truth,'' said the woman, a teacher who declined to give
her name.
   ``Sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced
our leadership to do the same,'' said Boris Sorokin, a 50-year-old
designer.
   Unofficial shrines sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscow
apartment, where candles flickered alongside his portrait. Outside
the offices of the weekly newspaper Moscow News on Pushkin Square,
a popular gathering place for political activists, portraits and
flowers were displayed.
   An entry in a notebook for mourners' comments outside Sakharov's
apartment building declared, ``The conscience of the nation has
died.''
   Moscow News _ an organ of the official press, which had branded
Sakharov an ``utterly ignorant person'' _ took the rare step Sunday
of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.
   Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence
telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President
Bush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech he
delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet
hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''
   On Sunday night, Soviet TV's newscast ``Seven Days'' also paid
tribute to Sakharov, leading the program with a 10-minute report on
him.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda published a poem by Yevgeny
Yevtushenko that read in part:
   ``History's most peaceful rebel, in dying, did not come down
from the cross, but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of
the world.''
   On Saturday, Pravda published what amounted to a public apology
to Sakharov.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders said in
an obituary that Sakharov had been the victim of ``gross
injustices'' and praised him as a ``man of honesty and sincerity.''
   Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rights
activist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag and
periodically closing her eyes. A son and daughter from his first
marriage and son and daughter of Bonner also attended, along with
four grandchildren.
   Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when the
funeral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M.
Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-voting
member of the country's ruling Politburo.
   The foreign dignitaries expected to take part in Monday's
ceremonies include Lech Walesa, head of Poland's Solidarity
movement, who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union,
and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak, who now live
in Israel.
   Israel's best known Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky, was
refused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to Moscow,
said Sharansky's spokesman, Avraham Ben-Yaakov. Begun and Slepak
said they would lay a wreath on Sakharov's grave in Sharansky's
name.

<HEAD>Couple Who Committed Suicide Linked to Spiritual Guide, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former professor and his wife who shot
themselves to death had consulted a spiritual guide who is facing
lawsuits in the deaths of seven associates, according to a report
published Sunday.
   David and Glenda Goodman, who killed themselves in late October,
were among a tightly knit group who followed the teachings of Terri
Hoffman, who reportedly told students she was an incarnation of
Christ, The Dallas Morning News said.
   The Goodmans' deaths bring to nine the number of associates of
Hoffman who have committed suicide or died in accidents since 1977.
   Mrs. Hoffman is accused in two Dallas lawsuits of profiting and
``mind control'' in the deaths of the seven who died before the
Goodmans: five followers and two of her husbands, the paper said.
It did not say when the lawsuits were filed.
   The suits by the victims' survivors allege that Mrs. Hoffman
used hypnosis to make her associates change their wills and
insurance policies to favor her and her metaphysical organization,
Conscious Development of Body, Mind and Soul Inc.
   Papers filed with the lawsuits allege that Mrs. Hoffman caused
her followers to kill themselves or suffer fatal accidents.
   The Goodmans had written checks to Mrs. Hoffman for more than
$110,000 in return for her showing them the ``purple realm,'' their
promised realm, the paper said, citing police sources.
   Fred Time, Mrs. Hoffman's attorney, refused to discuss specifics
of the case but told the newspaper that she was not connected with
the Goodmans' deaths.
   ``This is character assassination,'' the attorney said. ``You
have nothing to go on. ... What's wrong with giving a large gift in
return for spiritual guidance? Call up some of the big churches and
see if anybody died and left them money.''
   Mrs. Hoffman, who declined an interview with the newspaper, did
not immediately return a telephone call from The Associated Press.
   The Goodmans' badly decomposed bodies were found in their Lake
Highlands home Nov. 25. Authorities have not determined the exact
circumstances of their deaths, but have ruled that no third person
participated in the shootings.
   Goodman was a Berkeley and Yale-educated business and computer
professor at Southern Methodist University. He left teaching at the
private Dallas college in 1987 to begin an investment counseling
service and newsletters.
   Dallas police said Friday the Goodmans' deaths were still under
investigation.
   ``Even though the evidence indicates that these two deaths were
not caused by an outside agency, the unusual circumstances have
caused us to keep this case open,'' Deputy Police Chief Ray Hawkins
told the paper.
   ``When these cases were ruled suicides, we basically got out of
it,'' police Detective Bobby Hammer said when contacted by The
Associated Press on Sunday. He said they were currently not
investigating the other deaths.
   The paper said Mrs. Hoffman had about 20 followers, some of whom
were students at SMU.
   The newspaper said manuscripts police found at the Goodmans'
home show they were studying Mrs. Hoffman's teachings of gods and
spirits, rays, energy and karma.
   ``You are no longer David Goodman, son of Alice &amp; Leonard,''
said one passage addressed to Goodman in his wife's handwriting.
``That person is gone because the programming is wiped out. You are
Jupiter now.''

   Romanian security forces with tanks and
water cannons battled thousands of anti-government demonstrators
after police tried to deport a dissident clergyman, the Hungarian
news agency and other sources said Sunday.
   It was believed to be one of the largest outbreaks of
anti-government demonstrations in at least two years in Romania,
whose hard-line Communist leaders have crushed dissent and rejected
the reforms under way elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   The Hungarian state news agency, MTI, quoting a local Hungarian
television reporter in Szeged, said an eviction order against the
Rev. Laszlo Toekes of the Reformed Church in Timisoara was to be
carried out Sunday afternoon.
   Other sources, however, said the authorities had intended to
deport the minister on Saturday. Toekes' fate was not known, MTI
said.
   MTI said Toekes and his family had been guarded for several days
by hundreds of ethnic Hungarian and other Romanian citizens who
formed a human chain to protect him. Toekes has championed ethnic
Hungarian rights.
   ``They tried to prevent the eviction of their clergyman, when
hell broke loose and the human chain changed into a demonstration
of thousands against (President Nicolae) Ceausescu and his
regime,'' MTI reported, citing eyewitness accounts.
   ``Riot police tried to suppress the demonstration, and a bloody
brawl started,'' the Hungarian report said. ``It took almost two
hours for the policemen to gain the upper hand.''
   The report did not say what day the violence broke out, but
other sources reported protest both Saturday and Sunday.
   MTI, quoting the television reporter in Szeged, said,
``Eyewitnesses saw bloodied young people in the streets of
Timisoara and Ceausescu pictures floating on the Bega Canal. They
said many of the demonstrators were arrested.''
   No number was given for those arrested. There was no immediate
injury toll either.
   MTI, quoting travelers returning from Romania, said police used
water cannons against the demonstrators in the West Romanian city.
A Czechoslovak citizen was quoted as saying he had seen tanks and
blockaded streets.
   Earlier, a source at Hungarian television in Budapest told The
Associated Press that at least 10,000 Romanians had demonstrated
Sunday against Ceausescu's authoritarian rule in Timisoara, about
30 miles from the Romanian border.
   Yugoslav travelers returning from Timisoara told The AP in
Belgrade that tens of thousands of people were milling in the
streets Sunday morning. The Yugoslavs said that ``the entire city
seemed on the streets.''
   They said that when they left the city at 2 p.m. that day,
cordons of soldiers, three-deep, were blocking traffic at main
intersections, and large detours were necessary to depart.
   According to the Hungarian television source, the angry crowd
broke display windows of bookstores and threw out books by
Ceausescu.
   According to the source in Budapest, a large part of the crowd
guarding Toekes marched downtown Sunday afternoon, shouting slogans
such as ``Down With Ceausescu!''
   Police reportedly attacked the protesters and managed to control
the crowd by late afternoon.
   Late Sunday, a caller told the Hungarian Danubiusz radio station
in Budapest that tens of thousands were still in the streets of
Timisoara. He said he got his information by telephone.
   The newspaper Die Welt in Bonn, West Germany, said hundreds of
supporters prevented Toekes' deportation on Saturday.
   According to the report in Monday editions, a crowd of 500 on
Saturday ringed the church where Toekes sought refuge after he had
been stabbed by masked, unknown assailants on Nov. 2.
   The faithful, initially only ethnic Hungarians, took turns
because of sub-zero temperatures, Die Welt reported. Later, ethnic
Romanians and members of the Romanian Orthodox Church joined the
crowd, it said.
   By midnight, more than 4,000 had come to the church to protect
Toekes, the newspaper said. It said police units left after they
were confronted with shouts of ``Away With You!'' They were
replaced by plainclothes officers, the Bonn report said.
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav witnesses reported that around 9 p.m.
Saturday, the main square around the Continental Hotel was filled
with about 3,000 people. Their report could not be independently
confirmed.
   The Romanian state news agency Agerpres did not report on the
weekend demonstrations.
   Ceausescu, who was elected Romanian Communist Party chief on
March 22, 1965, is the longest-serving Soviet bloc leader.
   He has stamped out virtually all dissent in Romania. His crash
industrialization program and his frantic efforts to repay all of
Romania's $11 billion debt have led to perennial shortages of
consumer goods and rationing of basic foodstuffs.
   The last major demonstration was believed to be in November
1987, when at least 10,000 factory workers and other citizens
protested against his hard-line rule in Brasov, Romania'
second-largest city.
   In Budapest, hundreds of Hungarians gathered in front of the
Romanian Embassy on Sunday, chanting slogans and singing
Transylvanian songs.
   Transylvania is in western Romania, where most of the country's
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians. They have long complained of
discrimination by Romanian authorities.

   East Germany's struggling Communists called
for a ``human, democratic socialism'' and stressed their opposition
to German reunification as an emergency party congress ended Sunday.
   The 2,700 Communist delegates scrapped their old party platform
and adopted a new one designed to guide the party until its next
regular congress in February.
   The congress ended with a new name for the discredited party,
which is trying to maintain a role for itself as elections approach
next May. Delegates changed the party's official name from the
Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the Socialist Unity Party of
Germany-Party of Democratic Socialism.
   Under pressure from mass pro-democracy protests, the party in
the past two months has ousted hard-line leaders, opened the Berlin
Wall and other borders, promised free elections and ushered in
reforms.
   In the latest change, Premier Hans Modrow announced that East
Germany's new domestic intelligence services will be under direct
control of the government. The new agency will replace the hated
Ministry for National Security, which was dissolved.
   The new Communist platform says the party roots lie in the
``Communist and social democratic workers' movement,'' a phrase
aimed at disassociating the party from 40 years of Stalinist rule
from the top.
   ``The goal is a new, human, democratic socialism'' in East
Germany, the platform said, in an echo of a phrase used by former
Czechoslovak Communist leader Alexander Dubcek. Dubcek's attempt to
create ``socialism with a human face'' was crushed by East Germany
and four other Warsaw Pact nations that invaded his country in 1968.
   ``It was the first democratic party congress we have staged in
decades,'' East German party chief Gregor Gysi told delegates.
   Gysi, a 41-year-old lawyer who has defended the rights of the
opposition, was elected to head the Communists during the first
part of the congress Dec. 9-10. The meeting resumed on Saturday.
   In a keynote speech Sunday, Gysi urged further political,
economic and military reforms.
   He reiterated the Communists' opposition to German
reunification, saying East Germany must remain ``a humanistic,
socially oriented alternative'' to its capitalist western neighbor,
the official news agency ADN reported.
   He said the existence of two Germanys is ``the guarantee for
ensuring peace and stability in Europe,'' according to ADN.
   However, in Leipzig on Sunday, delegates at the founding party
congress of Democratic Awakening, a church-led reform movement,
voted 350-35 that the right of German unity should be inscribed in
the East German constitution.
   Gysi also urged the adoption of a new national constitution and
creation of a supreme court to defend it. He urged a reduction in
the length of army service and ``an immediate freeing of military
capacities for the economy.''
   Gysi called for discussions with church leaders on a law
protecting religion in East Germany. He said the Communists favor
protecting ``Jewish religion and culture'' and urged Modrow's
government to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.
   Modrow was quoted by an Israeli newspaper Sunday as saying East
Germany is willing to change its policy of denying responsibility
for the Nazi Holocaust as a way to establish diplomatic ties with
Israel.
   ``We have approached Israel officially with a request to discuss
establishing diplomatic relations,'' Modrow was quoted as saying in
an interview in the daily Haaretz.
   While West Germany has paid billions of dollars in reparations
to Holocaust survivors, East Germany traditionally has denied
responsibility on the grounds that it did not exist as a state at
the time.
   On Saturday, meanwhile, President Bush said he would be ``very
responsive'' to any request from East Germany for emergency
wintertime food aid.

   Federal agents Sunday searched the
secluded estate of a federal judge killed by a mail bomb delivered
to his home. Investigators said a drug-related motive was one
possibility being examined.
   Robert S. Vance, an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge,
was killed instantly when the package exploded Saturday afternoon
in the kitchen of his suburban Birmingham home, authorities said.
His wife, Helen, was injured and remained hospitalized Sunday in
serious condition.
   Vance, 58, a progressive force in Alabama during 11 years as
state chairman of the Democratic Party, was the third federal judge
to be assassinated in 10 years. The three are believed to be the
only federal jurists killed this century.
   FBI spokesman Tom Moore said there were ``specific leads'' but
declined to elaborate, saying only that investigators were pursuing
numerous possibilities.
   Asked whether Vance's death was connected to drug cases handled
by his court, ``It is not being ruled out, but it is no more
prominent than several other avenues we are following. We are
reviewing his full case load.''
   Agent Allen Whitaker said every FBI agent in the Birmingham area
was working on the case. He said many details could not disclosed
because of the ``very rapid, breaking nature of this
investigation.''
   U.S. Marshal Thomas C. Greene said Vance had not asked for
protection and the marshal's office was not aware of any threats on
his life. Greene would not say whether security has been increased
for judges because of the slaying.
   Asked about security for other federal judges, Moore said,
``They have been warned,'' but declined to say if any were under
guard. Judges may request security at any time, he added.
   Vance, appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977, served in
a circuit that reviewed cases from Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
   ``As a member of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, they heard
many appeal cases related to drugs from Miami,'' Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., a longtime friend of Vance, said Saturday.
``There's speculation in that regard, but nobody knows.''
   The circuit has 12 judges, as well as six judges on senior, or
semi-retired, status. The judges generally serve on three-judge
panels that review rulings made by trial-level courts.
   In Miami, U.S. District Judge Lawrence King said if Vance's
death were related to drug trafficking, ``you would be more apt to
see this type of violence directed toward a judge or magistrate at
the trial level in Florida, or perhaps Alabama.
   ``But who knows?'' King told The Birmingham News.
   Vance's two-story home in Birmingham's most exclusive suburb was
cordoned off Sunday as federal and local authorities searched it.
   Whitaker said FBI agents and postal inspectors spoke with Mrs.
Vance at the hospital, and she ``has provided information that will
be helpful in an investigation.''
   Whitaker said Mrs. Vance apparently was not standing close to
her husband when the bomb exploded. She was able to call a
neighbor, who then summoned police to the home, Moore said.
   ``Indications are that it was delivered by regular U.S. mail,''
not special delivery, Moore said.
   Moore said Vance's family was being guarded, but declined to
give details. The couple, which had been married 36 years, had two
sons, Robert S. Vance Jr., a Birmingham lawyer, and Charles Vance,
whose residence wasn't known immediately.
   Whitaker and Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber
joined investigators inside the home on a narrow, curving road
lined by houses set deep in wooded estates.
   Vance was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 by
President Carter and took his seat the following year. He continued
to live and work in the Birmingham area, although the court is
based in Atlanta.
   As state Democratic Party chairman from 1966 to 1977, Vance was
a force for racial moderation, fighting off attacks by then-Gov.
George C. Wallace against the national Democratic Party.
   In 1974, Wallace sought to wrest control of the state party from
Vance, but in a secret ballot in Birmingham, Vance turned back
Wallace's handpicked choice for chairman.
   ``He was a voice of sanity in turbulent times and a leader of
reasoned action,'' said Heflin, who met Vance more than 30 years
ago when they were young trial lawyers. ``Alabama and America's
jurisprudence has suffered a tremendous loss.''
   It was believed that only two other federal judges have been
assassinated this century.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco, 56, was shot and killed at
his home in Pelham, N.Y., in 1988 by a former policeman angry at
Daronco's dismissal of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by his
daughter. Charles Koster, 67, killed himself after gunning down the
judge.
   District Judge John H. Wood Jr., 63, was killed by a sniper
outside his home in San Antonio in 1979. Charles Voyed Harrelson
was convicted of the contract killing and is serving two life
sentences in a Texas prison. El Paso drug trafficker Jamiel
``Jimmy'' Chagra, who authorities say ordered the hit, was
convicted of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of Wood's
murder and various drug charges. He is serving a life sentence in
federal prison.
   Chagra had been scheduled to go on trial on drug charges before
Wood the day the judge was slain.

<TEXT>
   Rep. George Crockett has called for the
decriminalization of drugs, becoming the first member of Congress
to do so publicly and drawing sharp criticism from drug czar
William Bennett.
   ``Decriminalization is the only solution,'' Crockett, D-Mich.,
said in an interview in Washington published Sunday in The Detroit
News.
   ``Our courts are burdened down with these drug cases and there
is nothing they can do about it,'' he said. ``And here we are
talking about spending additional billions to build jails and
prisons to send people to.''
   Money now spent on drug enforcement should be shifted to job
training for the urban poor, education, health care and day care,
said Crockett, whose district includes Detroit's economically
depressed east side.
   Crockett said he had no immediate plans to introduce legislation
decriminalizing drugs because it could not win congressional
approval.
   Told of Crockett's position, Bennett cursed, and said, ``Here we
go. We were wondering who was going to be the first,'' the News
said.
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said he feared others in Congress could join Crockett and subvert
the administration's anti-drug efforts.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet became the first
federal judge to publicly support decriminalization. Also favoring
decriminalization are Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke and economist
Milton Friedman.
   Bennett said that giving drugs the same legal status as alcohol
could cause even greater social and economic problems.
   ``Alcohol has done quite enough damage, thank you,'' he told the
News. ``And if you want to see people using crack go from 1
(million) or 2 million to 10 million, make it as available as
alcohol.''
   Bennett also spoke against legalizing drugs Sunday in an
appearance on the ABC-TV program ``This Week With David Brinkley.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fatal shooting of a U.S. military
officer over the weekend came after months of a vitriolic,
government-sponsored campaign against Americans and their
government.
   The campaign peaked Friday when a member of the People's
Assembly, which named Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as chief of
government, asked for guns for the people ``because what we have to
do here is kill gringos and pro-gringos.''
   ``We have to kill all gringos,'' a Panamanian soldier guarding
the Defense Headquarters told reporters earlier, pointing to a U.S.
Army helicopter hovering a short distance away.
   He spoke before the Assembly declared Panama ``in a state of war
as long as the U.S. aggression lasts.''
   Saturday's shooting death of the American officer near Panama's
defense headquarters was ignored by the Panamanian military. Its
communique on the incident referred only to a ``provocation'' by
the U.S military.
   The U.S. Southern Command said the officer and three others, all
off duty, unarmed and in civilian clothes, were detained by
Panamanian soldiers near the checkpoint. According to an official
statment, the officers were ``hassled'' and tried to flee by car
and the Panamanian soldiers shot at the car.
   For nearly two years, the U.S. government has tried to force
Noriega's ouster. Noriega, commander of the Panamanian Defense
Forces, was indicted in Florida in February 1988 on U.S.
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. Noriega denies the
charges.
   The U.S. government has tried to isolate Noriega
internationally, accusing him of annulling presidential elections
in May because his handpicked candidate lost.
   U.S. and Panamanian forces have faced each other several times
when the Panamanians tried to block U.S. military maneuvers that
Washington claims are necessary to train forces here to defend the
Panama Canal.
   Yet, until two years ago, these same forces regularly
participated in joint military exercises and their officers
socialized together.
   It all ended abruptly after the first military coup attempt
against Noriega on March 16, 1988. Noriega accused the United
States of trying to infiltrate the Defense Forces and brought back
Panama officers attending special training programs at U.S.
military bases.
   As the United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama, the
government-controlled news media began a campaign aimed at
discrediting the U.S. government, all U.S. officials and U.S.
military officers here.
   Newspapers depicted U.S. soldiers as cowards and drug addicts
and carriers of the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
   The United States was shown in column after column as a country
where discrimination is practiced against blacks and Hispanics.
   But mostly, the columnists said the United States was trying to
back out of the treaties that call for transfer of the Canal
adminstration to Panama and the closing of U.S. bases at the end of
the century.
   They whipped up nationalistic fervor, portraying Noriega as the
leader of the resistance to U.S. attempts to revoke the treaties.
   No opposition or independent news media exist in Panama.
   A Southern Command source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said of the Saturday shooting, ``This is the result of
anti-American propaganda and the totally unprofessional attitude of
the Defense Forces.''
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, leader of the Christian Democratic Party
and former opposition vice presidential candidate, said, ``It is
the result of the psychological war and the escalation of the
confrontation between the countries' military.
   ``We had warned that the series of confrontations would produce
incidents like this. The danger is that this can provoke a greater
confrontation.''
   The climate of confrontation was new in a country where the
official currency is the U.S. dollar, where relations with the
United States have been close since the United States built the
Canal at the beginning of the century and where thousands of U.S.
soldiers and their dependents used to live off-base in Panama City.
   About 13,000 American troops are stationed in Panama, and a
total of about 40,000 Americans live here.

<TEXT>
   Passengers on an Air China jet hijacked en
route from Beijing to New York said Sunday the flight was
frightening even though they didn't know the plane had been
commandeered until it landed in Japan.
   ``The rumors were spreading around the plane; we didn't know
what was happening,'' said Ann Ofstedal, who said she had been
studying for the past three years at a Beijing university.
   ``Even from talking to the crew, we could get very little
information,'' she told reporters at San Francisco International
Airport. ``They said they were also very worried.''
   Flight 981 was flying from Beijing to New York via Shanghai and
San Francisco on Saturday when Zhang Zhenai ordered the plane to
fly to Seoul, South Korea. Korean authorities refused permission to
land, and the plane was diverted to Fukuoka Airport on Japan's
southern island of Kyushu.
   There, a purser reportedly pushed Zhang out the plane's rear
door, shattering his legs and pelvis. He was being treated at a
Japanese hospital.
   Authorities reported that Zhang, a 35-year-old cotton factory
foreman, threatened crew members with a knife. He reportedly told
Japanese police he participated in pro-democracy demonstrations in
China last June and decided to flee after the crackdown.
   Ofstedal said the crew at one point asked passengers for rope.
Although no one was told why it was needed, she said there was
speculation an overwrought passenger needed to be subdued. Later,
she said she heard Zhang had been tied up with the rope with the
help of passengers.
   The plane returned to Beijing with 185 of its 200 passengers,
including Zhang's wife and 10-year-old son. Police and airline
officials said they did not know what happened to them, but foreign
reporters saw the wife led from the plane in handcuffs.
   The flight to New York then resumed on a new aircraft. China's
Civil Aviation Administration said most of the passengers were
Chinese. Japanese police said there were 19 non-Chinese, including
12 Americans.
   Ofstedal said she became suspicious when the flight from Beijing
to Shanghai, which normally takes 1 hour and 45 minutes, lasted
more than two hours and the plane spent more than an hour circling
a small island.
   ``People were acting very calm,'' she said, ``but it was
obviously very tense.''
   Wang Yuan of Beijing said she didn't realize a hijacking was
taking place, although she and others were worried because the
flight to Shanghai was taking so long.
   When the plane flew to Fukuoka, she said through a translator,
passengers knew something was wrong when they looked out the
windows and saw tall buildings and roadways full of cars, an
unusual sight in China.
   Asked if she was sympathetic to Zhang's comments that he was
motivated by fear of reprisals for speaking out against his
government, Ofstedal replied, ``I think he could have chosen a
better way.''

   U.S.-backed insurgents rocketed
Afghanistan's capital Sunday, killing 10 people and wounding 27,
official Afghan radio said.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said the rebels fired three
U.S.-made rockets from the Paghman heights about 15 miles west of
Kabul. It did not say what kind of rockets were used.
   The guerrillas claimed earlier in the day they had killed 50
troops of the Communist government who tried to dislodge them from
the strategic heights in fighting Dec. 11-13.
   MIDIA, a rebel news agency, also reported heavy losses on both
sides in northern clashes near the Soviet border.
   Radio Kabul blamed Sunday's rocketing of Kabul on the
fundamentalist Ittehad-i-Islami rebel party of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf.
It said children were among the casualties.
   Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government has reported hundreds of
civilians killed in guerrilla rocket attacks on the capital since
June.
   In its telex dispatch, the MIDIA agency said rebels killed 20
government officers and 30 soldiers when troops attacked guerrilla
positions in Paghman. It also said the guerrillas destroyed three
tanks and five other military vehicles while repelling the attack.
   It said two rebels and two civilians were also killed in the
fighting.
   Official Afghan media have not reported any such offensive, but
Radio Kabul claimed on Dec. 15 that government forces found and
destroyed 50 rebel rockets in the Paghman area.
   MIDIA also said Sunday that clashes occurred Dec. 6 and Dec. 8
in Daulatabad in northern Balkh province, about 27 miles south of
the Soviet border.
   It claimed that 22 government troops and militiamen were killed,
and 20 deserted to the rebel side.
   The agency said the government responded with heavy bombing and
shelling that killed 20 rebels and civilians, including two
guerrilla commanders it identified as Chari and Mohammad Nabi. It
said 40 other people were wounded.
   ``Fighting is still going on in full swing,'' MIDIA said.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 military coup that set off the insurgency. Soviet forces
ended nine years of military intervention on Feb. 15, but Moscow
continues to back the ruling Marxists.
   Despite predictions of their early defeat after the Soviet
pullout, government forces continue to hold Afghanistan's major
cities. The guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan, reportedly
control most of the rugged countryside.

   A small airplane that tried to hoist a banner
aloft from an airport and fly it over a professional football game
crashed Sunday, killing the pilot, a police official said.
   The Cessna 182 took off from Lunken Airport and had swooped back
over the airport low enough to hook a banner suspended between two
poles when the accident occurred around 1:30 p.m., said police
traffic officer Dan Katt.
   The plane lost power when it hooked the banner, Katt said. The
pilot quickly dropped the banner and tried to glide back toward the
runway for a crash landing, but clipped the top of a helicopter
which had just landed on a taxiway, he said.
   The pilot _ Robert Jeff Ott, 26, of Batavia _ was taken to
University Hospital in Cincinnati where he died, Katt said.
   Bobby Leach, a traffic reporter for radio station WKRC in
Cincinnati who was in the helicopter, was treated and released for
minor injuries at Mercy Hospital, Katt said.
   The helicopter pilot was not hurt, the officer said.
   The plane was attempting to carry the banner over Riverfront
Stadium for a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Houston
Oilers. Katt said he did not know the size of the banner.

   Police set up a roadblock late
Sunday to prevent 1,000 activists, including Winnie Mandela, from
staging a candlelight vigil outside the prison where black leader
Nelson Mandela is held.
   Mrs. Mandela and the other demonstrators, traveling in 10 buses
and about 50 cars, were stopped by police about a half-mile outside
Victor Verster Prison near Cape Town, where her husband is confined
in a staff house.
   The demonstrators called for the immediate release of Mandela
and all others they consider political prisoners.
   Police gave Mrs. Mandela permission to visit her husband, but
she declined after learning that the other demonstrators would not
be allowed to hold their vigil at the prison's front gate.
   A magistrate turned down an application for the demonstration
because it was not submitted the required five days in advance.
   After reaching the roadblock, the activists sang freedom songs
beside the the road, then held a meeting in the nearby town of
Paarl.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, has been
imprisoned for more than 27 years. He is serving a life sentence
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   His release, however, is widely expected within weeks.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement, met President F.W. de Klerk at his office
Wednesday to discuss prospects for opening black-white political
negotiations.

<HEAD>Final Round for Assault Rifle Lovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAINBOW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recreational shooting of assault rifles
is going out with a bang in California.
   A state ban on more than 50 varieties of the powerful weapons
takes effect Jan. 1. More than 200 people gathered on a windswept
ridge in this town about 50 miles north of San Diego on Saturday to
get in one last round of gunfire.
   ``I just had to get my hands on an Uzi one more time,'' said
Robert Anderson, a self-described ``gun nut'' who paid a $12
admission fee and up to $1 per round to fire a variety of the
military-style rifles.
   Cathy Tolly, a 26-year-old registered nurse who helped organize
the shoot, called it ``a last hurrah for law-abiding citizens who
happen to like assault-type weapons.''
   ``Once the ban takes place, you won't see events like this
anymore,'' she said.
   The state Legislature enacted the ban after a drifter toting an
AK-47 assault rifle shot and killed five children and wounded 30
other people in Stockton last January.
   Angry gun enthusiasts said the ban would do little to stem such
shootings.
   ``They're kidding themselves if they think taking away assault
weapons is going to lessen the crime problem,'' said Bart Montier,
who brought an antique cannon to the shoot. ``The whole thing's
absurd. You're not going to see gang members turn in their
weapons.''
   Montier said he came to the shoot try out an Israeli Gallil
assault rifle.
   ``Now that's a gun,'' he exclaimed after firing several rounds
into a row of clay pigeons set up against a hillside.
   Nearly 40 high-performance weapons were available for shooting,
including more than two dozen types of assault rifles and an
assortment of pistols and shotguns.
   Elodie McKee of Burbank _ who wore a T-shirt reading, ``Just Say
No to Gun Control _ said the shoot was a way of dressing down
gun-control advocates.
   ``Just by showing up here I think we make a statement,'' said
Ms. McKee.
   ``These guns have gotten such a bad rap that a lot of (gun)
enthusiasts would prefer to just go into hiding and not mention
them,'' said T.J. Johnston, another organizer. ``But I don't feel
that way. That's why we held this thing, to show people what
they're going to be missing.''

<HEAD>`Sunshine,' A Play by William Mastrosimone, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not exactly boy-meets-girl, but
``Sunshine'' by William Mastrosimone deals unconvincingly with the
relationship between two unhappy strangers looking for love.
   The play, the second offering of the season by off-Broadway's
Circle Repertory Company, opened Sunday night.
   The title character (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a small-time porno
queen who works in a place called Club Paradise where the women sit
in isolated Plexiglas booths and talk dirty to the customers. She's
the star of the place, has a large following of regular customers
and even gets her name up in lights.
   Two such raunchy scenes frame the heart of the one-act play, an
unlikely and lengthy encounter between Sunshine and her White
Knight, a disillusioned paramedic named Nelson. Their meeting
occurs bizarrely. Sunshine bursts into Nelson's shabby studio
apartment one night after jumping out of a van driven by her
husband.
   It doesn't take long before they are serving as each other's
analyst and patient, offering advice and telling their individual
tales of woe. The anguish level is pretty high. He's trying to
reconcile with his wife who left him some seven years ago. She's
trying to break from a dominating husband and a degrading job.
   John Dossett is fine as Nelson, considering he is forced to
recite _ with a straight face _ such lines as ``My soul hurts.''
Leigh is even better. She brings a conviction to what could be _
and often is _ the stock role of the bad girl with a good heart.
Her tough-as-nails exterior gradually softens, revealing a
vulnerability that rings true no matter what Mastrosimone has her
say. And Jordan Mott delivers a memorable vignette as a college
student, one of Sunshine's more pathetic customers.
   The playwright is best known for ``Extremities,'' a revenge
fantasy play that later became a film. It dealt with one woman's
attempt to punish a would-be rapist. ``Sunshine'' takes a less
savage look at the same subject _ how men and women regard each
other and what sex, whether violent or not, can do to a
relationship.
   Marshall W. Mason directs ``Sunshine'' with his customary
energy, and the production rarely falters, even if you don't
believe the dialogue or plot Mastrosimone has concocted.

   Heavily armed kidnappers claiming
allegiance to a Chilean revolutionary group released a supermarket
tycoon Sunday and turned themselves over to authorities.
   After receiving guarantees of safety, the kidnappers _ a
Canadian woman and six South American men _ left the house in which
they held Abilio Diniz Filho and boarded a bus that took them to
police headquarters for interrogation.
   The 53-year-old Diniz Filho, with a stubble and looking haggard
but otherwise in good condition, emerged from the house smiling and
was greeted by applause after nearly a week in captivity. A police
van drove him to a luxury apartment where his former wife and his
children live.
   More than 200 police, armed with rifles, machine guns and
shotguns, surrounded the house in a lower middle-class neighborhood
of Sao Paulo at dawn Saturday. The kidnappers demanded $200,000, an
armored car and a plane to escape to another country, but police
refused to negotiate on those demands.
   Diniz Filho is vice president of Pao de Acucar supermarket
chain, one of Brazil's largest. He was kidnapped Dec. 11 in front
of his house in Sao Paulo.
   His brother, Alcides Diniz, said the kidnappers never demanded
ransom.
   Police Inspector Nelson Silveira Guimaraes said the seven _ four
Chileans, one Argentine, one Brazilian and the Canadian woman _
``told us they belonged to Chile's Revolutionary Leftist
Movement.'' They were not identified.
   He said police believed they also took part in the abduction of
Brazilian advertising executive Luiz Sales in July. Sales was
released after his family paid $2.5 million in ransom.
   Accompanying the kidnappers in the bus were Roman Catholic
Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, archbishop of Sao Paulo, who took
part in the negotiations; and former Finance Minister Luiz Carlos
Bresser Pereira, a senior executive at Pao de Acucar.
   Bresser Pereira told reporters that part of the agreement with
the kidnappers was that the supermarket chain would pay for their
legal defense.

   The Communist premier has warned
that his government will resign if Parliament rejects a package of
austerity measures he plans to submit Monday to contain
hyperinflation.
   The three-day parliamentary session has already been billed in
the media as ``D-day'' for Yugoslavia, with a sharp clash expected
between liberals and conservatives representing the country's
different regions.
   Premier Ante Markovic's government, which took over in March,
has moved fast to introduce market mechanisms as a way out of
Yugoslavia's worst-ever economic crisis, marked by a 2,000 percent
annual inflation rate, a $17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent
unemployment rate.
   His reform program has been criticized by conservatives in
Yugoslavia's Communist leadership, especially in the republic of
Serbia, who oppose his market-oriented efforts and the promotion of
greater political pluralism.
   Several key government-sponsored reforms have been blocked by
the conservatives, and Markovic is expected to demand urgent
changes in Yugoslavia's constitution that would give more power to
the federal government to implement its program.
   The new austerity package has been kept under strict secrecy,
and speculation about the measures have caused a huge shopping
spree by Yugoslavs fearing their effect.
   ``Never before in (postwar) parliaments have there been so many
expectations and so much guesswork,'' about a session of
Parliament, the state-run Tanjug news agency said Sunday.
   Last week, the U.S. State Department said it was worried by
rising tensions in Yugoslavia and urged the people to unite in
support of Markovic's reform program.
   The tough reform measures are expected to include a substantial
devaluation of the national currency, the dinar, and tight monetary
and budgetary controls accompanied by stiff wage and price
discipline. But government spokesmen have denied rumors of a wage
and price freeze.
   The government has already announced that if the package is
passed, the country would receive ``substantial financial aid,''
including a loan of up to $1 billion from the International
Monetary Fund and some Western countries.
   In Serbia, the largest of the country's six member republics,
the opposition to Markovic's reforms is centered on claims that he
has done nothing to curb rampant inflation.
   Fearing popular discontent that could be sparked by the
austerity program and the economic reforms, Serbian authorities
have instead proposed short-term measures designed to bring down
inflation.
   In an apparent attempt to pressure the government, the state-run
trade unions of Serbia and its ally Montenegro have announced short
general warning strikes for next week to coincide with the
parliamentary session.
   Some delegates at the current Serbian Communist Party congress
have demanded that the Serbian parliamentary deputies not even vote
on Markovic's package, saying they should demand his immediate
resignation.
   Markovic has repeatedly stressed that if his program is not
approved in Parliament he will tender the Cabinet's resignation.
   A prolonged dispute between the leaderships of Yugoslavia's
constituent states over the country's political and economic future
came to a head in November, when Serbia broke off all business and
government ties with the northern region of Slovenia.
   Janez Drnovsek, head of Yugoslavia's collective state
presidency, was expected to address the parliamentary session with
a report on the deep splits that have developed between the
constituent regions and on measures to curb the crisis.
   In another development, a Christmas message from Crown Prince
Alexander, now a London resident, was published in the Sunday
edition of the Vjesnik daily newspaper in Zagreb.
   It was the first time such a thing has been done in the
country's 44-year Communist history.
   Alexander's father, the late Peter II, was Yugoslavia's last
king. The monarchy was abolished when the Communists came to power
after World War II and male members of the exiled royal family were
banned from returning.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved a
reorganization plan for ex-billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, paving
the way for him to emerge from bankruptcy protection next month.
   Under the plan approved Friday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold
Abramson, the $222 million left of Hunt's multibillion-dollar
fortune will be transferred to a trust next month and proceeds from
the trust will be used to repay debts.
   The plan was jointly proposed by Hunt and a group of his major
creditors.
   Hunt's bankruptcy attorney, Russell Munsch, said his client was
``very glad to be out of bankruptcy, but bitter at what bankruptcy
has cost.''
   In September 1988, Hunt and his wife, Caroline _ who owed more
than $1 billion to creditors _ filed for protection under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy law.
   The smaller estate of his brother, William Herbert Hunt, still
remains under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but is expected to
be closed next week. William Hunt's plan faces challenge from two
creditors who have about $25 million in claims.
   About 80 percent of the money raised under the liquidation of
Bunker Hunt's trust is to be used to repay the Internal Revenue
Service. Minpeco S.A., a Peruvian mining concern that won a $132
million court judgment against the brothers stemming from their
alleged attempt in 1979-80 to corner the silver market, will also
receive a large share of the liquidated estates.
   Under terms of the settlement, Hunt lost his real estate
holdings, including the largest cattle ranch in Australia and the
Bronco Bowl recreation center in Dallas.
   He will be allowed to keep his $1.8 million Dallas mansion, his
Cadillac, household furnishings, clothing and 50 percent of the
proceeds from non-producing gas and oil properties.

   A skydiver died Sunday when he, his son and
others leaped from a building more than 40 stories high in a
parachuting sport called base jumping, a police official said.
   Richard A. Pedley, 57, of Walnut leaped from the building in the
Century City neighborhood around 1:30 a.m. along with four or five
other people, said police Sgt. Curt Hussey.
   Pedley's parachute either became snagged or tangled on the
building, and he plunged into a nearby construction site.
   Pedley was flown to the University of California-Los Angeles
Medical Center, where he died later in the morning, Hussey said.
   Pedley's 22-year-old son, Richard A. Pedley Jr., stayed at the
site and was cited for trespassing. The other skydivers fled before
police arrived, Hussey said.
   Base jumping is done from fixed objects, either manmade or
natural, such as sheer cliff faces or bridges over deep ravines. A
clandestine activity in most instances, base jumpers usually make
their attempts at odd hours.

<HEAD>DOE Reopens Plutonium Processing Plant For Limited Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key plutonium production plant at the
Hanford nuclear reservation reopened Sunday to process spent
nuclear fuel that has been stuck in the plant since it was shut
down a year ago, the government said.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins authorized the reopening
Friday based on a review by the department and the need to improve
safety at the facility, said Department of Energy spokesman Tom
Bauman.
   The Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant takes nuclear fuel rods
from Hanford's N Reactor and dissolves them to extract plutonium
and uranium. The plutonium must be processed further at another
facility for use in nuclear weapons.
   The N Reactor has been closed since late 1986, but PUREX
continued to operate until last December to reduce a large
stockpile of irradiated fuel.
   Westinghouse Hanford Co., which operates the nuclear production
complex for the government, said it shut the plant down because
operators did not follow procedures in handling a loss of steam
pressure.
   DOE officials have said previously that the shutdown of the
PUREX plant would not hurt the country's ability to make nuclear
weapons.
   A review of safety requirements and procedures, along with
retraining of about 500 PUREX workers, was completed in March.
Equipment repairs and improvements to waste treatment systems at
the 33-year-old plant delayed the resumption of operations, Bauman
said.
   PUREX is expected to remain open for four to six weeks to finish
processing material that was in the plant when it was shut down,
Bauman said.
   Then, the plant will be shut for another year to make additional
modifications and improvements before resuming the processing of
spent fuel in storage at Hanford, Bauman said. Processing that
inventory is expected to take until 1995.
   From PUREX, plutonium is sent to Hanford's Plutonium Finishing
Plant, which has been operating only periodically for the past
year. Bauman said that plant will gear up eventually to handle the
additional plutonium from PUREX, but he could not say when that
might occur.
   The nation's only other plutonium extraction operation is at the
Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, but it has little to do
because reactors at that site have been closed for safety reasons.

   Scotland's chief law officer was quoted Sunday as
saying criminal trials arising from the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 would probably take place in the United States.
   ``In this matter, on terrorists, I think there can be little
doubt that the Americans could assert a jurisdiction,'' Lord
Fraser, the lord advocate, was quoted as saying in an Edinburgh
weekly newspaper.
   But a spokesman for the lord advocate ``firmly refuted'' reports
that police have gathered enough evidence to charge several
suspects in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the New York-bound flight.
   The Sunday Times of London said that despite their cautious
public statements, Scottish investigators told a secret,
five-nation summit of security services that ``charges are now
possible against certain persons.''
   The report said that police heading the international manhunt
told the meeting in Meckenheim, West Germany, that because of
extradition obstacles, some suspects might have to be tried abroad.
   The newspaper said leaders of security services in Britain, West
Germany, the United States, Sweden and Malta attended the summit.
It did not identify the source of its information or say when the
meeting occurred.
   A spokesman for Scotland's Crown Office, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom, said: ``The lord advocate has no
evidence before him with which to initiate warrants or extradition
proceedings.''
   Lord Fraser and Chief Constable George Esson of the Dumfries and
Galloway Constabulary told a news conference on Friday that
considerable progress had been made in their investigation but that
no arrests were imminent.
   The Pan Am flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and
changed in London to a larger Boeing 747 which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground. Investigators say the blast was caused by a bomb made of a
plastic explosives and packed in a radio-cassette player that was
placed in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo hold.
   About 40 Lockerbie residents whose houses were damaged in the
crash gathered in the rain Sunday to witness the dedication of a
stone memorial to the victims.
   A piper played a Scottish lament, and three clergymen led
prayers and blessed the red sandstone block memorializing the
victims.
   The Sunday Times said police ``have for some time suspected who
the killers are'' but would probably wait until their inquiries are
completed in three or four months before starting criminal
proceedings.
   Esson told the news conference he could not put a timetable on
his investigation. He confirmed that Ahmed Jibril's radical
Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, or PFLP-GC, has been under
investigation. Esson also confirmed investigators' interest in
Mohammed Abu Talb, a member of another Palestinian group, the
Popular Struggle Front, who is in jail in Sweden awaiting verdicts
Thursday on unrelated bombing charges. The Sunday Times said
Scottish police will interview him Monday.
   Terrorism experts and Western media say the PFLP-GC may have
been hired by Iran to avenge the July 1988 downing of an Iran Air
jetliner with 290 people aboard, by a U.S. warship in the Persian
Gulf. Iran has denied involvement.
   CBS reported in February that the attack was in revenge for the
1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and the U.S. decision to talk with the
Palestine Liberation Organization. They said Jibril cleared the
operation with Syrian intelligence and had the full backing of the
Libyan secret service.
   In his interview with the weekly newspaper Scotland on Sunday,
Lord Fraser said criminal trials would almost certainly take place
in the United States if it claimed jurisdiction under international
law. On Friday, he said it was possible trials could be held in
several countries.
   ``While this is an outrage to Scotland ... I never lose sight of
the fact that this was intended as a direct assault on American
sovereignty and for that reason I understand the strength of their
feeling, of their claim to American jurisdiction.''
   Lord Fraser was quoted as saying that Scotland would not compete
with the United States to extradite suspects from other countries,
unless a country holding a suspect refused an extradition request
because the United States has the death penalty.
   ``If, on the other hand, the United States was in that position
to secure extradition when the United Kingdom couldn't, I want
these people brought to justice and I wouldn't stand in the way of
anything,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Lord Fraser was quoted as saying he considered winding down the
police inquiry during the summer because of lack of progress, but
police then discovered new leads pointing to the Mediterranean
island of Malta.
   Unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase bomb was
transferred to Flight 103 in Frankfurt from an Air Malta flight.
Some reported that police have traced scorched clothing and an
umbrella in the suitcase to Malta.
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson said Sunday that Britain's
airports are more secure now than at the time of the bombing,
particularly for American aircraft ``which are regarded as a higher
risk than ours.''

   A Colombian intelligence officer who swallowed
drugs and a Peruvian congressman who failed to declare $25,000 in
cash have been arrested by U.S. Customs agents in separate
incidents, a spokesman said.
   Hernando Parra-Londono, a Colombian military intelligence
officer, was detained at Miami International Airport after getting
off an Avianca flight from Medellin, Colombia, on Thursday, Customs
spokesman Michael Sheehan said.
   He told inspectors he had come to Miami to visit a heart doctor,
but was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital for X-rays after he
displayed nervous and suspicious behavior, Sheehan said Saturday.
   At the hospital Thursday evening, Parra-Londono admitted
swallowing cocaine pellets, and as of Saturday had passed more than
100 weighing about two pounds, Sheehan said. No formal charges will
be filed until Parra-Londono had finished passing the pellets, he
added.
   In an unrelated case Friday, Peruvian Congressman Enrique Lujan
Pujada, 48, was arrested and charged with failing to declare more
than $25,000 in cash.
   He initially told inspectors when he arrived aboard an Aero Peru
flight that he had $5,000 in cash and another $5,000 in checks. But
when inspectors said they intended to pat him down, he admitted he
had more cash, and they found $30,280 in his pockets, Sheehan said.

   Gov. Rose Mofford entered a hospital Sunday after
complaining of chest pains, a spokesman said.
   The 67-year-old Democrat entered St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center about 3 p.m., said Vada Manager, Mrs. Mofford's
press aide.
   The hospital did not immediately issue a report on Mrs.
Mofford's condition, but Manager said a preliminary check indicated
a gall bladder problem.
   ``She did not have a heart attack,'' he said.
   Further tests were expected, and the governor was prepared to
remain hospitalized until Monday, Manager said.
   The voluntary hospitalization came after one of Mrs. Mofford's
most difficult weeks in office.
   On Dec. 9, she apologized for commuting the prison terms of two
convicted murderers and said she would like to rescind the
commutation because the victims' families had not been notified in
advance. Some political observers criticized her apparently
contradictory statements about her intentions.
   On Friday, she agreed with a legal opinion from Attorney General
Bob Corbin, who said the commutations were void due to a
technicality.
   In the same week, Mrs. Mofford was blasted by Arizona's
primarily Democratic labor leaders for lauding an anti-union
organization for ``excellence in the field of employee relations.''
   Mrs. Mofford began complaining of chest pains Saturday while
visiting the Grand Canyon gateway cities of Flagstaff and Williams,
Manager said.
   He said Sunday night that the pains had eased.
   Mrs. Mofford, Arizona's first woman governor and the former
secretary of state, succeeded Republican Evan Mecham in April 1988
when the state Senate convicted him on two articles of impeachment.

   Maoist guerrillas killed 11 people,
including a judge and a teacher, in three separate attacks in the
Peruvian highlands, police said Sunday.
   The bodies of a married couple and another man, all peasant
farmers, were found Sunday in the ashes of a house destroyed by
fire in the town of Chaquicocha, 30 miles west of Huancayo. The
city in the Andean highlands 140 miles east of Lima is a hub of
guerrilla activity.
   Police said a message painted on a wall of the burned house
said: ``Death to informers.'' The victims' bodies showed bullet
wounds in the head and signs of torture.
   Police also said Shining Path guerrillas shot to death seven
people in two neighboring villages 27 miles south of Huancayo on
Friday, including a judge and a teacher from the village of Moya.
The other five victims were from San Mateo.
   Another peasant farmer was shot to death late Saturday in his
home in Sapallanga, a village six miles southeast of Huancayo,
according to police.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its armed insurgency
against Peru's elected governments in 1980. The government says
more than 17,000 people have died in the violence.

   A Colombian presidential candidate on Sunday
called on Americans to step up the war on illegal drug trafficking
while his South American country increases the pressure on drug
barons.
   Colombia is pursuing its war on drugs with renewed vigor
following the death last week of Rodriguez Gacha, the country's
second-most wanted drug trafficker, Cesar Gaviria said here on the
second day of a three-day U.S. visit.
   But Americans need to help by swearing off illegal drugs, said
the presidential candidate, who was in Chicago to enlist the
support of an estimated 50,000 Colombian-Americans.
   ``Not only President Bush, I think every American can do much
more to fight the war on drugs,'' Gaviria said. ``It's a program
for every person in society.''
   ``We are talking about fighting this problem to the end ...
until it is solved,'' he said.
   Gaviria spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel where he
was meeting with Colombian-Americans.
   Several attempts have been made on his life in Colombia, and the
hotel was heavily guarded by U.S. Secret Service agents,
bomb-sniffing dogs and Gaviria's bodyguards.
   Gaviria, who was Sen. Carlos Galan's presidential campaign
manager, became a leading Liberal Party contender after Galan was
assassinated at a political rally Aug. 18. The Colombian government
accused drug traffickers of arranging the killing.
   The Conservative Party, weakened by internal division, is given
little chance of winning the presidential election in May,
political analysts say.
   Gaviria reiterated support for a treaty to extradite drug
traffickers to the United States, saying Colombia's justice system
cannot effectively prosecute the drug lords.
   ``We don't have the capacity to punish these people'' because of
terrorist activities and the assassination of federal judges, he
said.
   Since Colombian President Virgilio Barco declared war on
traffickers and enacted emergency extradition measures this summer,
traffickers have retaliated with a wave of bombings and
assassinations of public officals, including two federal judges and
a leading leftist politician.
   The administration has extradited 10 middle-level traffickers to
the United States as part of its crackdown, but had failed to track
down any top targets until Rodriguez Gacha's death.
   Dr. Luis Yarzagaray, a Colombian-born American citizen, said
Chicago's Colombian community will work to enlist more U.S.
economic support to accomplish those goals in the South American
country.
   ``I want to give a legacy for my children,'' said Yarzagaray, a
Loyola University professor. ``I simply want the right thing.''
   Gaviria was scheduled to return to New York City on Sunday,
where he began his visit, before returning home on Monday,
Yarzagaray said.

   The Rolling Stones' North American
tour ends here with the fortyish band taking fans through a
three-night medley of rock 'n' roll history from 1965's
``Satisfaction'' to 1989's ``Rock and a Hard Place.''
   The Stones opened Sunday night in 16,000-seat Convention Hall,
and were to play there Tuesday and Wednesday nights in their first
indoor concerts of the four-month, 32-city ``Steel Wheels'' tour.
   At a news conference before the concert Sunday, guitarist Keith
Richards said he was satisfied with the road show, but expecting a
bit of a letdown.
   ``I'm always sorry to see the tour end,'' the unshaven Richards
said. ``When I'm lying in bed, the body is saying, `Where's the
gig?'''
   Tickets sold for $38.50, $150 and $250. The show will also be on
pay-per-view TV Tuesday for $19.95 and $24.95, depending on the
cable company.
   Asked whether ticket prices to see the show in person were too
high, Richards shrugged and said, ``You can't justify it.''
   The group started performing together in 1962. Lead singer Mick
Jagger is 46 years old, Richards will be 46 on Monday, bassist Bill
Wyman is 53 and drummer Charlie Watts is 48. Guitarist Ron Wood,
who joined the Stones in 1975, is 42.
   Outside the entrance to Convention Hall, vendors did a brisk
business selling everything from $3 pins to $450 leather jackets
bearing the Stones' trademark tongue emerging from ruby-red lips.
   Laura Stevens, who drove with a friend from Virginia, said the
four-hour trip and $100 scalper tickets for $38.50 seats were worth
it.
   ``It's our last chance to see them,'' said Ms. Stevens, 19, of
McLean, Va.
   Miyano Daisuke, 21, of Tokyo topped the two Virginians in
dedication and deep pockets.
   Daisuke, pulling out his round-trip plane ticket from Tokyo,
said he and nine friends had bought $150 tickets for all three
shows from a broker in Japan.
   ``They're very famous in Japan,'' Daisuke said. ``Every Japanese
guitarist plays the same as Keith Richards.''
   Guests expected to appear with the Stones Tuesday include
guitarists Eric Clapton and John Lee Hooker, as well as vocalist
Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin of the group Guns 'N Roses.
   Guns 'N Roses has been criticized for lyrics offensive to
blacks, homosexuals and immigrants.
   But Jagger dismissed a question about whether he was concerned
about appearing with the group.
   ``We're trying to appeal to the black, gay market,'' he said
with a laugh.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Changes In Views Toward Abortion.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide poll published Sunday suggests a
shift in tolerance toward abortion compared to the results of a
similar survey last spring.
   According to the poll conducted for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV,
37 percent of the 1,000 registered voters surveyed said they
supported legal abortion ``in all circumstances,'' compared to 25
percent nine months ago.
   Eleven percent said abortion should not be legal in any case,
compared to 19 percent in March, according to the Boston Sunday
Globe.
   There was little change over the question whether abortion
should be legal ``in certain circumstances.'' Fifty-three percent
said ``yes'' in December, compared to 51 percent in March.
   The random telephone survey by KRC@Communications Research of
Cambridge had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   On the question of whether public funds should be used for
abortions for women who cannot afford them, 49 percent of the
December sample said the money should be available and 34 percent
said it should not be used.
   In March, 35 percent of those asked said public funds should be
available, while 49 percent said the government should not earmark
money for abortions.
   The December poll posed a question that was not asked in March:
``In general, do you think that a woman should or should not be
able to obtain an abortion?'' Sixty-eight percent said she should
and 25 percent said she should not.
   The Globe said the December poll sought to assess interest in
laws passed in Pennsylvania following the July U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that gave states more authority to regulate abortions.
   Seventy-six percent said they favored for their state the
Pennsylvania rule requiring a woman seeking an abortion to be
advised by medical workers about fetal development, abortion risks
and alternatives and wait 24 hours before the procedure is done.
The law was opposed by 16 percent.
   Sixty-one percent favored the idea of a Pennsylvania law that
requires a woman seeking an abortion to tell her husband unless he
is not the father, cannot be found, would threaten the woman if
told or the pregnancy was caused by rape. It was opposed by 31
percent.

   Exit polls showed free-market champion
Fernando Collor de Mello had defeated his socialist adversary by a
narrow margin Sunday in Brazil's first free presidential election
since 1960.
   Initial returns late Sunday showed Collor de Mello running neck
and neck with Luis Inacio da Silva.
   Many of the millions who turned out waved campaign flags and
sported candidates' buttons in a climate that appeared totally free
of political or military intimidation.
   Unofficial results gave Collor de Mello 14.1 million votes with
37 percent counted. Leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva had 14
million, Globo TV, the nation's largest network said.
   The Superior Electoral Court's official count _ far behind with
just 1.2 percent of the vote tallied _ gave da Silva 452,780 votes,
or 44 percent, and Collor de Mello 408,061, or 39 percent. The rest
of the votes were blank, nullified or abstentions.
   Election officials said final results would be known in three
days.
   Collor de Mello, a member of one of Brazil's wealthiest families
and former governor, and Rep. da Silva , a former lathe worker and
union chief, appeared to be in a dead heat when the polls opened.
   But one survey, by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and
Statistics, gave Collor de Mello, of the rightist National
Reconstruction Party, 52 percent of the vote in an exit poll. The
institute interviewed 1,218 Brazilians after they voted in 95
cities between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
   Da Silva, of the radical left Workers Party, had 48 percent of
the vote, according to the institute.
   ``We are predicting a victory for Collor de Mello by 2.5 million
to 4 million votes,'' Carlos Augusto Montenegro, director of the
polling company, said in a live televised interview.
   A second exit poll, by the DataFolha polling institute, gave
51.5 percent to Collor de Mello and 48.5 percent to da Silva after
11,995 people were questioned in 223 cities nationwide between 8
a.m. and 4 p.m., DataFolha said.
   The exit polls buoyed officials in the Collor de Mello camp.
   ``We are not celebrating yet, but we are relieved because the
polls are confirming our expectations of victory,'' said Claudio
Humberto Rosa e Silva, Collor de Mello's chief spokesman.
   Officials of da Silva's party said it was too early to concede.
   ``We need to get the end of the vote counting before conceding
anything,'' Eduardo Suplicy, a member of the Workers Party's board
of directors, said in a televised interview.
   From the Amazon rain forest to the concrete sprawl of Brazil's
southeastern cities, lines of voters began forming before sunrise.
   Polls opened at 8 a.m. and closed at 5 p.m. (2 P.M. EST),
although voters in line then were allowed to cast ballots.
Unofficial reports from polling stations in several major cities
showed turnout lower than anticipated.
   Election officials attributed this in part to heavy rains in
central, northeastern and far southern Brazil.
   Rain also caused the deaths of four people in northern Brazil
when two trucks carrying voters to polling stations overturned on
slippery roads.
   The Workers Party complained that in some cities, da Silva
voters couldn't get to the polls because private bus companies
idled their vehicles. It asked federal election officials to
investigate.
   Some 82 million voters across Latin America's biggest nation
were registered for the election, seen as a huge step toward the
return of full democracy after a rightist military regime ruled
from 1964 to 1985.
   The new president takes office March 15 for a five-year term.
The current president, Jose Sarney, took office in 1985 after he
was picked by an electoral college controlled by the military
regime.
   The election also was seen as a referendum on the past two
decades, which have been marked by 1,500 percent annual inflation,
sinking real wages and corruption.
   Despite wild street rallies that capped a week of mudslinging by
both candidates, voting was peaceful across the country.
   Da Silva supporters jammed Brasilia's confetti-littered business
district in cars, honking horns and waving huge red-and-white flags.
   Collor de Mello, 40, voted in his home district of Maceio, the
capital of Alagoas state on Brazil's northeastern Atlantic tip.
   ``I am confident in the grand victory the Brazilian people will
obtain with our proposal of rebuilding this country,'' he said. He
later flew to Brasilia to follow the vote count.
   The burly da Silva, 44, kissed his ballot as he cast it in the
southeastern industrial city of Sao Bernardo do Campo, on the
outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city.
   ``Today is the happiest day of my life,'' said the former
factory worker, dressed in a red T-shirt and jeans. He drove to a
friend's ranch to await the final results.
   Collor de Mello and da Silva were the top vote-getters in a
field of 21 candidates in balloting Nov. 15. Neither obtained the
majority needed to win, and Sunday's runoff was scheduled.
   Collor de Mello campaigned for a free-market economy and an end
to government corruption. He was backed by business leaders, the
military and the media.
   He tried to portray his adversary as a radical who favored
violent, Marxist revolution.
   Da Silva also had the support of the Brazil Popular Front, a
coalition that includes Marxists, unionists and the dominant
liberal wing of Brazil's powerful Roman Catholic Church.
   Da Silva said he supports redistribution of land and wealth,
reforms in education and health care and a moratorium on Brazil's
$110 billion foreign debt.
   He criticized his opponent as a media creation with ties to the
``ruling class'' and the former military regime.
   The last popularly elected president of Brazil was Janio
Quadros. He resigned in 1961 after seven months in office citing
``occult forces.''
   A right-wing military regime overthrew Quadros' successor, Joao
Goulart, and ruled from 1964-1985.

<HEAD>Secret Taping Raises Questions On Reaccreditation of Conn. Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national commission is reconsidering
its accreditation of Connecticut's state police because the
department secretly taped telephone calls between suspects and
their attorneys, The Hartford Courant reported Sunday.
   The Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies Inc.
has given the police until the end of the month to document that
its policies in 1988 complied with a requirement that suspects be
given confidential access to lawyers, the newspaper said.
   The commission also called on the department to explain its
taping operations, the Courant said.
   The issue of secret taping arose in a manslaughter trial in
October, and controversy snowballed last month when the Courant
reported that the state police routinely tape-recorded telephone
conversations at state police barracks, including calls between
suspects and lawyers.
   The disclosures led to the forced resignation of the
department's head, Lester J. Forst. A federal grand jury is
investigating the practice, and Congress is scheduled to begin
hearings on the issue Monday. A group of attorneys has sued the
state on behalf of prisoners.
   Tape-recording telephone calls is legal in certain
circumstances, such as with a judge's permission or when one of the
people talking knows the call is being recorded. But recording
calls between lawyers and clients is forbidden under federal law.
   The Courant reported earlier this month that it found evidence
that suspect-attorney phone calls may have been monitored in
several other states, including West Virginia and Utah.
   The newspaper reported Sunday that state police officials
assured the accrediting commission more than a year ago that they
guaranteed privacy for suspects talking to lawyers. The paper cited
a February 1988 report from the non-profit commission, which
accredits police departments across the country.
   The Connecticut department is one of only nine state forces in
the country to win full accreditation. The department prepared 18
months for the evaluation and paid the commission $14,620 for it.
   Bernard R. Sullivan, who replaced Forst as the state's public
safety commissioner and head of the state police, said he wrote the
commission recently to suggest it consider setting a specific
standard on police taping.
   After problems caused by taping in Connecticut and elsewhere
were solved, Sullivan said, ``This may turn out to be a very
positive thing for policing.''
   As part of the accreditation process, four commission inspectors
pored over documents, scrutinized equipment and interviewed
department members for five days.
   Police who knew of the secret taping did not tell commission
inspectors, said Ken Medeiros, executive director of the
commission. Commission inspectors rely mainly on police cooperation
and integrity rather than any investigation of their own, he said.
   Accreditation is considered a seal of approval for a department.
It immediately reduced the Connecticut department's liability
insurance costs by 10 percent. It also enhanced the department's
reputation in law enforcement circles and was supposed to assure
the public that the agency was complying with public safety laws
and regulations.

   A speeding car driven by a man trying to
elude state troopers slammed head-on into another car on an
expressway Sunday, killing three women and critically injuring the
man, police said.
   Robert L. Harrison, 30, of Youngstown sped the wrong way on the
city expressway for about three-fourths of a mile before the
collision around 1 p.m., police said.
   Harrison was believed to have snatched a purse at a supermarket
in nearby Girard, then escaped in what police believe was a stolen
car, said Girard Police Capt. Dominic Petrarca.
   A patrolman gave chase after seeing the car run a red light,
Petrarca said.
   Harrison eluded the police car. But when he spotted a state
Highway Patrol cruiser on Interstate 680 later, he headed eastbound
onto the westbound lane of the expressway, the captain said.
   The victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Their identities
were being withheld pending notification of relatives, officials
said.
   Harrison was listed in critical condition Sunday night at Saint
Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown.
   An officer who answered the phone at the Girard police
department Sunday night refused to say whether charges had been
filed against Harrison. He refused to give his name.

   American soldiers in battle gear
guarded base perimeters Sunday after a U.S. officer was killed, a
second wounded, and a Navy couple beaten in the worst
U.S.-Panamanian confrontation in 25 years, U.S. officials said.
   The White House deplored the killing and termed it a
``consequence'' of Panama's being under the rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Panamanian troopers used trucks and buses to block streets
leading to Noriega's headquarters after the violence Saturday
night. Panamanian officials said the Americans had wounded a
Panamanian soldier and two civilians.
   A U.S. Southern Command statement said the slain officer was
``off duty, unarmed and in civilian clothes when he and three
others were stopped by Panamanian soldiers near the (Panamanian)
Defense Headquarters in the old section of Panama City.''
   The Panamanians tried to drag the Americans from their car and
fired at them as they drove off, killing one officer, it said. His
identity was withheld.
   In Washington, a Defense Department statement confirmed that a
U.S. officer was fatally shot and said a second soldier was grazed
on the ankle by a bullet.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces accused U.S. officers of a
provocation, without mentioning the American's death.
   The Pentagon gave this additional account:
   A U.S. Navy lieutenant and his wife were stopped at the same
roadblock as the other soldiers a half-hour earlier and witnessed
the shooting. The Panamanians then blindfolded both with masking
tape and interrogated them for about four hours.
   They repeatedly beat and kicked the man in the groin and head
and threatened to kill him if he did not give information on his
duties and unit.
   His wife's head was cut when she was slammed against a wall and
she later collapsed. Panamanian soldiers also threatened her
sexually before the pair was escorted back to an avenue that
connects with U.S. military bases and released.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in his statement, ``The
lack of discipline and control in the Panamanian Defense Forces is
further evidence that Panama is a country without a government.''
   Panamanian and U.S. military officers were reported Sunday to be
meeting to discuss the incident, opposition politicians said. The
Southern Command refused to comment.
   The contact was reported to be through the Joint Board, a
liaison between the two countries' military forces that deals with
Panama Canal security and defense.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, a Southern Command spokesman, said the
U.S. officers had made a wrong turn and were lost.
   The Panamanian statement said the U.S. officers had ``broken
through checkpoints and fired at the headquarters building,
wounding a soldier and two civilians, including a 1-year-old girl.''
   President Bush was informed of the situation by National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, White House deputy press
secretary Roman Popadiuk said in Washington.
   ``We deplore this act of violence. We are presently looking into
the circumstances of this incident,'' Popadiuk said. ``The Noriega
regime is isolated both domestically and internationally and has
been using force and intimidation to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people. Acts such as those of last evening are the
consequence of such a regime.''
   Word of the death and rumors of U.S. retaliation spread quickly.
Sunday morning people at a gas station spoke of the imminent
``arrival of the Americans.''
   U.S. soldiers mobilized along the perimeters of U.S.
installations a few miles northwest of Panama City. Lines of
armored personnel carriers and trucks stood at the ready inside the
boundary of Fort Clayton.
   Combat units were not seen at U.S. bases closer to Panama City,
including Southern Command headquarters at Quarry Heights, which
borders the capital to the west.
   The 12,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Panama Canal area were
restricted to base and only authorized movement was permitted.
   A golf course at Fort Amador, a base shared by U.S. and
Panamanian military units, was deserted Sunday. A causeway where
Panamanians picnic near the fort was empty except for a salsa group
rehearsing.
   The nearby Bridge of the Americas across the Panama Canal was
open.
   Panama's opposition leaders refused to comment directly about
the shooting, saying the information they had received was
``confusing.''
   But Christian Democratic leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said the
confrontation was the result of other clashes between Panama and
the United States in recent months.
   The bloodiest previous incident between the nations occurred on
Jan. 9, 1964, in the time of the old Panama Canal Zone, which
consisted of a 10-mile-wide strip across Panama that was considered
U.S. territory.
   U.S. police and soldiers clashed with Panamanian rioters over
the display of the U.S. and Panamanian flags at a high school. Four
U.S. soldiers and 22 Panamanians died, and Panama broke diplomatic
relations with the United States for three months.
   Noriega, who was de facto leader through his control of the
Defense Forces, was named chief of government on Friday by a
rubber-stamp assembly. It said Noriega's leadership was needed to
confront a ``state of war'' caused by U.S. economic sanctions and
other efforts to oust the general.
   Panama and the U.S. government have been at odds since February
1988 when Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in the
United States.
   He denies the charges and says Washington wants to oust him to
make it easier for the United States to renege on the Panama Canal
treaties, which transfer the canal to Panama at the end of the
century and close U.S. military installations here.

   Gales and torrential rain from an Atlantic storm
lashed Britain and France over the weekend, killing at least three
people and leaving 11 missing.
   The storm, raging along the English Channel and Atlantic coast,
briefly pushed into Paris on Sunday with 50 mph gusts accompanied
by thunder, lightning and a sudden downpour.
   The 35-foot fishing boat Destiny sank Saturday in Scotland's
Firth of Clyde, 750 feet from safe harbor, and all six fishermen
were believed lost in heavy seas and driving snow, authorities said.
   David Rowan, captain of the Irish coastal steamer Arklow Victor,
was washed overboard early Sunday in the Bay of Biscay off France
as his ship went down. A French helicopter rescued his five
crewmembers.
   Waves swept two teen-age boys out to sea late Sunday. One, 16,
was hit by a huge wave near Folkstone on England's south coast. The
other, 14, was swept to his death as he and a group of youths
watched the waves from rocks at Castletown on the Isle of Man in
the Irish Sea.
   Rain sent golfers at a course in the Paris suburb of
Villennes-sur-Seine scampering for cover under a covered brick
platform which serves as a driving range, firefighters said. A
sudden gust knocked the structure over, killing Bernard Ecarlat,
58, a doctor, and injuring nine people, three seriously.
   Wind toppled a 6{-foot-high outdoor wall in Aubervilliers,
another Paris suburb, crushing to death two men passing by, police
said.
   On the Normandy coast at St. Pierre-en-Port, a French coast
guard helicopter searched in vain for Stratos Smyranos, 32, a
Parisian taking a seaside holiday who was walking his dog along the
shore Sunday when caught by a high wave.
   No trace was reported of TV cameraman-journalist Joseph Delage,
37, carried out to sea by a huge wave Saturday night as he
struggled to repair his car at Conquet, about 385 miles west of
Paris. Delage had just finished shooting footage of the storm for
the French television network FR3.
   Storms battered the southwest coast of England and Wales all day
Sunday and boats stood by to rescue hundreds of people from
Lymington, on the south coast, as a high tide approached.
   Parts of the town were under five feet of water but the high
tide passed without further flooding.
   Homes were evacuated in Porthleven and Newlyn in Cornwall in
southwesternmost England on Sunday, and there was extensive
flooding in east Devon and Dorset in the south.
   In France, waves broke a protective dike Saturday on the Ile de
Sein, west of Brest, flooding about 13 summer homes, said residents
reached by telephone. No injuries were reported on the island, home
to 600 people.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seemed an unlikely role _ Zsa Zsa
Gabor as Saudi Arabian royalty _ and the sharp-tongued Hungarian
lost the job Sunday because of a tiff with the sheik who's
bankrolling the movie.
   Sheik Mohammad al-Fassi fired Miss Gabor before the pair even
met because of disparaging remarks she made about him in a dispute
over travel expenses, said Chris Christenson, producer of the
planned epic on Saudi history.
   The dispute began Saturday, when Miss Gabor canceled an
appearance with the sheik to promote the project, Christenson said
Sunday.
   The actress-socialite _ recently in the news for slapping a
police officer _ demanded travel expenses and in the course of
discussions with an aide, said she had reservations about the
sheik's character, Christenson said.
   ``She said `I don't trust him. I've heard bad things,' and he
went and told the prince,'' Christenson said. ``And the prince came
to me and said why would we use (her) if she doesn't trust me. ...
He said `I will not have anything to do with that.' ''
   Miss Gabor, believed to be in her late 60s or early 70s, denied
making disparaging remarks.
   ``How can I say something about someone I don't even know?'' she
asked. ``I was supposed to go there and read a script. I think this
was a publicity stunt to get the press over there. ...
   ``I don't know him, I don't wish to ever meet him,'' she said of
the sheik. ``This man didn't come down for half an hour and I said
thank you and I left. No one takes advantage of me,'' she said in a
telephone interview from the Polo Club in Palm Beach County.
   The sheik and producer say they will spend $50 million on the
movie chronicling Saudi Arabia from the time of King Abdel-Aziz ibn
Saud to the present. Their attention was drawn by Miss Gabor's
trial for slapping the officer, and they cast her as the king's
mother.
   After the dispute, Miss Gabor left the sheik's estate, presently
populated by dozens of cats in connection with his $2.5 million
project to save the nation's stray felines.
   Miss Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail fined $2,937 for
her Sept. 29 misdemeanor conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills
policeman.
   Her movie roles include ``Moulin Rouge'' in 1953, ``Picture
Mommy Dead'' in 1966 and ``Up the Front'' in 1972.

<HEAD>Many Scroogy Shoppers in Britain's Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's 15 percent interest rates are
discouraging shoppers from splurging on Christmas gifts and
threatening the country's retailers with the worst selling season
in nine years.
   Many stores are packed with people, but many seem to be
modern-day Scrooges and aren't buying much. Christmas sales are
patchy.
   A last-minute flurry of purchases is expected, but this won't
salvage the crucial season, experts say.
   ``The vote on this Christmas will be that it was a very poor
Christmas,'' said Nick Bubb, a retail analyst with the investment
firm Morgan Stanley International in London. ``It's going to be
flat.''
   The disappointing pre-Christmas season has prompted many stores
to start slashing prices before Britain's traditional January
sales. Many also likely will defy the law requiring them to close
on Sundays and risk a fine of $1,600 to stay open on the day before
Christmas.
   The poor sales trend reflects a months-long downturn, and it's
bad news for retailers' profits, and their stock prices, which
generally have been depressed on London's Stock Exchange.
   But it's good news for consumers, who are benefiting from sales
in jewelry, consumer electronics, clothing and home furnishings.
   It's also positive for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government because slower sales are a sign that its
anti-inflation policy is working.
   ``It's been a bad year. Christmas will make or break some
people,'' said Harry Shepherd, director of the Oxford Street
Association. Oxford Street is London's main shopping street.
   Shepherd said he expects retailers to eke out an overall 1
percent to 2 percent sales gain, but that won't be enough to cover
higher costs.
   ``The Tiffanies of the world appear to be doing OK on the basis
that the very rich will always be rich and the retailers selling
three pairs of knickers for 99 pence are still doing very well.
It's the mass in the middle who are suffering,'' he said.
   Consumer electronics and furniture retailers will be hurt the
most, Bubb predicted.
   Experts agree that trading conditions are tough because of the
higher interest rates, which the government has pushed to an
eight-year peak to fight resurgent inflation. Inflation is running
at an annual rate of 7.7 percent.
   The higher interest rates have squeezed British homeowners, who
mostly hold adjustable rate mortgages and have seen their monthly
payments climb sharply.
   Before the economy began overheating more than 18 months ago,
Britain enjoyed a five-year, steady economic expansion fueled by
consumer demand.
   But growth in consumer spending has slowed from 7 percent in
1988, to an expected 4 percent in 1989, and is predicted to slow to
1 percent in 1990.
   The slowdown has been showing up in the government's retail
sales figures.
   In November, sales declined a sharp 0.8 percent from October,
the government announced recently. That meant sales for the latest
three months rose 1.1 percent over a year ago, the lowest such
growth rate since June 1982, figures from the Central Statistical
Office show.
   The retailers themselves are having to pay the higher interest
rates, and rents are pricey too. Wage costs also are up because
fewer teenage workers are available.
   Although the inflation rate is high, retailers can't raise
prices to enhance their profits, Bubb said.
   Their promotions aren't going to help the bottom line.
   Ratners jewelry stores, for example, are offering the equivalent
of $80 gift vouchers for every $240 worth of sales, while the Tandy
consumer electronics chain has slashed $8 off a radio cassette
player to $48.
   The longer-term outlook is gloomy too.
   The Confederation of British Industry, the country's major
business group, recently said one of its regular surveys showed
that retailers and wholesalers anticipate a deterioration in
business over the coming three months.
   It was the first time since the survey was launched in 1983 that
such a decline was expected.

<TEXT>
   For 25 years, Tom Carroll's volunteer
service corps has sent retired executives overseas to lend their
business expertise to foreign companies.
   Now several of his retirees are getting ready to pack their bags
and head for a new frontier: Eastern Europe.
   Carroll's organization, the International Executive Service
Corps, has embarked on an ambitious project to help meat
processors, textile factories and other government-owned businesses
in Poland. The first executive left in October, and others will
head for the airport after the first of the year.
   The projects are a way for Polish operations to learn Western
businesses ways, while giving retired executives an opportunity to
pass along their skills. The government-owned companies pay the
executives' expenses and also provide interpreters.
   The work in Poland comes as Eastern European nations undergo
revolutionary changes in their governments and economies.
   ``This is such a fantastic, magical time in the history of man.
It is a major renaissance of our time, an industrial revolution,''
said Carroll, who keeps miniature flags of several countries in his
ninth floor office in Stamford, overlooking Long Island Sound.
   ``We've got plenty of men we hope will play a major part in the
progress in Hungary and Poland,'' said Carroll, the chief executive
officer of Lever Brothers before becoming president of the corps in
1981. He is one of 50 paid employees.
   The corps, which has 10,700 volunteers, was founded in 1964 by
David Rockefeller and Sol Linowitz, who separately thought up the
idea of sending retired executives overseas. Since then, volunteers
have worked on more than 12,000 projects in 90 countries.
   The projects in the East bloc began in 1986 when a volunteer
went to Hungary to help a meat processing plant.
   ``It was so successful that when the guy went home, they wanted
him back,'' Carroll said.
   The first Polish project began in October when a former
manufacturing executive left his Texas home to advise a synthetic
fiber operation. Another 10 to 25 projects are expected next year,
said vice president Charles Neiswender.
   Pete Moyer, one of 39 executive recruiters, sat in Carroll's
office last week and briefed him on some of the projects, such as
plans to send a former executive with International Harvester to
advise a Polish tractor factory.
   He said a former RCA executive was leaving Jan. 5 to advise the
managers of an old television tube plant. Another retiree will
leave in April to advise a textile manufacturer.
   The corps is still looking for an executive to advise a copper
mining and smelting operation.
   Officials said many Poles already understand the way a
capitalist economy works, partly because of the black market that
has flourished through the 40 years of Communist rule that
officially ended in September.
   But Moyer said the government-owned operations need help in
organization.
   ``This picture tube outfit said they have 5,500 employees and
over 140 organization units, each of which has its own program and
plan, much of the time not being consistent with what top
management sees as the overall plan,'' he said. ``So they need
help.''
   Neiswender said employee motivation is another concern among
workers not used to the incentive system.
   ``Many of these government-owned companies have so many
employees that productive people are unproductive because they have
to trip on and step over the unproductive,'' he said.
   But Moyer, who worked on one of 17 projects in Hungary, said the
Eastern Europeans are eager to learn.
   ``What struck me was the hospitality, and from a philosophical
point of view, the eagerness to learn the know-how of American and
Western European practices, to understand how to run an
organization,'' he said.
   ``These are smart people. They're bright people. They're not
saying, `We're dumb, teach us something we don't know.' They're
saying, `We're coming from a different way, teach us something
different.'''

   The World Bank, the biggest source of aid to
the Third World, is planning new help to Eastern Europe but will
not reduce aid to developing countries, according to bank Vice
President Stanley Fischer.
   ``As far as the World Bank is concerned, we don't see how
lending to Eastern Europe is going to detract from our lending to
Africa and Latin America,'' Fischer, the bank's top economist, said
at a news conference Friday.
   Bank President Barber W. Conable said the bank had $350 million
worth of loans prepared for projects in Poland and might lend as
much as $1 billion more in the coming year. So far Poland has not
had any loans from the bank.
   ``As Poland stabilizes, if it does, it's very likely that our
lending program will increase,'' Fischer said.
   In the year that ended June 30, Hungary got $345 million in
loans, Yugoslavia $198 million and China $1.3 billion. There would
have been more for China, but Conable cut off new loans when
Beijing violently crushed the movement for more democracy last June.
   The bank's annual report on Third World debt, released Friday,
predicted that the money owed by developing countries would rise
next year to $1.319 trillion from this year's $1.29 trillion. It
estimated that this year Third World countries will be paying out
$51.6 billion in principal and interest beyond what they will be
getting in new loans.
   Third World governments complain that this outflow leaves them
little to put into schools, roads, farms and other public
improvements.
   The bank's loans for the year totalled $21.3 billion, most of
which it borrowed on world markets.
   The United States is the biggest shareholder in the bank, which
has its headquarters in Washington. China, Hungary, Poland and
Yugoslavia are already among the 152 countries that own it.
Czechoslovakia is trying to join, and the Soviet Union has said it
would like to.

<HEAD>Chinese Inflation Down in November; New Loans Made to Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prices in November were only 5.9 percent higher
than a year earlier, the government said Sunday in announcing in
the lowest inflation rate China has seen since 1987.
   However, the government was forced again to bail out large
state-owned factories hard hit by the austerity program that has
reduced inflation.
   The official China Daily said the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, granted the equivalent of $638 million in loans last
week to the state sector, which the government says must be
preserved as a pillar of the socialist system despite its
inefficiencies.
   Similar loans totalling $1.9 billion were reported in October
and November.
   The China Daily said the People's Bank and other banks
anticipate making total emergency loans of $21.2 billion to
state-owned industries in the fourth quarter to keep production
from sliding further.
   Industrial production dropped 2.1 percent in October from
October 1988, its first decline in a decade, and in November was up
less than 1 percent over November 1988.
   Some economists have pointed to the sluggish industrial
performance as a sign that the economy has entered a recession.
   The government clamped down on official spending, new
construction and bank loans in September 1988 in an effort to cut
inflation that peaked at about 40 percent, China's highest rate
since the Communists took power in 1949.
   Since then, inflation has dropped sharply, and the China Daily
said vegetable prices in October were actually 4.6 percent lower
than in October 1988, while fruit prices also declined.
   However, the austerity policy has left many companies so short
of cash that they cannot purchase raw materials, forcing the
government to issue special loans to aid priority sectors such as
the large state factories. The austerity also has resulted in a
backlog of unsold consumer goods, including automobiles and
television sets, which were in high demand last year.
   When foreign joint-venture car makers, including Shanghai
Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot, appealed for help, the government
spent $94 million to buy 7,440 cars. The state also issued
emergency loans to grain bureaus so they could purchase the fall
harvest.
   The repeated emergency loans have dealt a blow to the
government's plan to balance its budget. Earlier this year the
government projected a $2.2 billion deficit, but Western economists
say it could be four times that much.
   They say the government's method of controlling inflation, by
clamping down on credit, has only propelled the economy toward a
recession without resolving the causes of inflation, such as the
irrational price structure.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, which reported the November
inflation figure, said retail sales dropped by 1 percent from the
previous November. Bank savings were up more than 25 percent from
January, to $106.8 billion.

<HEAD>Iran Selling Oil In Advance, Saving On Imports After Abadan Reopened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's advance sales of oil have yielded
$2.6 billion, and it has saved $800 million in imported petroleum
products since its Abadan refinery resumed operations in April, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   In an interview with the daily Kayhan, Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh also reiterated his previous prediction that members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon be
able to produce as much oil as they want.
   Aqazadeh, in excerpts from the interview quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency, said the members of OPEC were nearing their
top production capacity and demand for oil would be strong enough
that quotas would become unnecessary.
   He said a decision was taken by Iran to sell oil in advance,
raising $2.6 billion, because of the ``favorable condition of the
market.''
   He said the contracts were to receive cash now and supply the
oil within 12 to 18 months, ``which truly cannot be considered
(extra) oil revenue, but rather a more flexible sales policy.''
   Aqazadeh said future Iranian oil-related revenues from 1989 to
1994 were estimated at about $83 billion, including crude oil, gas
exports to the Soviet Union, sales of liquefied gas and other
related products.
   Since the reopening in April of the huge Abadan refinery on the
Gulf coast near the Iran-Iraq border, Iran has saved $800 million
on imported refined products, Aqazadeh said.
   He also said the Arak refinery, with a capacity of 150,000
barrels a day, and the Bandar Abbas refinery, with a capacity of
230,000 barrels a day, would soon become operational.
