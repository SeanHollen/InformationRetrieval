<HEAD>Death Row Inmate Released to INS; May Face Deportation Hearing</HEAD>

   A death row inmate freed after serving eight
years for a murder he did not commit was turned over to federal
immigration authorities Wednesday for hearings on his deportation to
Canada, prison officials said.
   Jerry Bigelow's release was cleared last month by the state
Supreme Court when it ruled 6-1 not to review the state's appeal of
a lower court decision to acquit Bigelow of a murder for which he
was once sentenced to death.
   Bigelow, 28, a native of Canada who had been on Death Row at San
Quentin since 1981, was released to Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials at about 9 a.m. and taken to San Francisco, said
prison spokesman Lt. Cal White.
   ``Now he will face a deportation hearing and eventual return to
Canada,'' said Tony Marian, director of the detention and
deportation section of the INS.
   Bigelow's lawyer, Robert Bryan, said Bigelow would not oppose
deportation to Canada and could be deported as early as Thursday.
   Bryan said Canadian authorities have indicated they plan to
prosecute Bigelow for a 1980 prison escape. He said Bigelow had
served only one month of an 18-month robbery term before fleeing.
   But Bryan said he hoped Canada would take into account the years
Bigelow spent on Death Row for a murder he was later found not to
have committed.
   Formal deportation charges had not been filed against Bigelow,
but Marian said common charges include illegal entering the country,
overstaying a tourist visa or committing ``certain serious crimes.''
Bigelow has never been admitted to the United States for permanent
residence, Marian added.
   A bond hearing was planned before an immigration judge for
Thursday morning, said Marian. Bonds are set to ensure an
individual's appearance in court and, in some cases, to protect
public safety, Marian said, adding that authorities had not yet set
a bond amount for Bigelow.
   If Bigelow can post bond, he will be scheduled for a deportation
hearing in the future, Marian said. If he cannot or does not want to
post bond, Bigelow will be scheduled for a deportation hearing ``in
a matter of days,'' he said.
   Bigelow was serving a Canadian sentence for robbery when he
escaped and fled to California. He now faces possible deportation to
Canada to finish his sentence, White said.
   Bigelow was convicted of the Merced County murder of John Cherry,
then 26. Bigelow and Michael Ramandanovic were picked up hitchhiking
by Cherry, who was shot to death in a cornfield.
   Bigelow defended himself at his first trial, was denied a
court-appointed lawyer to assist him, and was convicted and
sentenced to death.
   Although state law requires all death sentences to be appealed to
the state Supreme Court, Bigelow asked the court to dismiss his
appeal. The court refused. Bigelow then tried twice to commit
suicide.
   In 1984, the court overturned his conviction and death sentence,
calling his trial a sham because of the failure to appoint a lawyer.
Bigelow remained on Death Row while facing retrial.
   A jury in Monterey County, where the retrial had been moved
because of publicity, came back with an innocent verdict on the
murder charge in May 1988.
   Citing inconsistencies in the case, Superior Court Judge Harkjoon
Paik refused to record the acquittal verdict and ultimately declared
a mistrial that would have allowed Bigelow to be tried again for
murder.
   But the 6th District Court of Appeal later unanimously upheld the
acquittal.

<HEAD>Alaska Attorney General Asks Exxon For Depositions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's attorney general asked Exxon on
Wednesday to allow the state to question its employees under oath
about how potentially significant documents on the Exxon Valdez oil
spill were destroyed.
   Attorney General Douglas Baily said the destruction of
computerized files at Exxon Co. USA headquarters in Houston was
``potentially a loss of devastating proportions'' to the
investigation of the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I assume that Exxon is as interested as we are in allowing the
public to have the full access, the full knowledge, of exactly what
it was that led to the destruction of those documents,'' Baily said
at a news conference.
   Exxon is under state and federal court orders to preserve its
records of the March 24 tanker spill in Prince William Sound.
Company officials have said the documents were destroyed
accidentally, but that other copies may exist.
   ``I have no idea at this point whether it was deliberate or
whether it was unintentional, but I think there's a big question out
there in the minds of the public as to whether it was deliberate or
accidental,'' Baily said.
   The court orders prevent parties planning litigation against
Exxon from undertaking depositions and other forms of pre-trial
discovery until the courts can settle the issues and procedures
involved, Baily said.
   The attorney general is giving Exxon until noon Thursday to
respond to his request. He said he got no reply from Exxon officials
Wednesday.
   ``In the event that they do not agree to that stipulation, we
will ask the court to alter its order so we can undertake that
limited discovery at the present time,'' Baily said, adding that
quick action was essential.
   Baily's news conference came after Exxon headquarters in Houston
had closed for the night, and calls there went unanswered late
Wednesday.
   A former Exxon computer technician, Kenneth A. Davis, told The
New York Times last week that he inadvertently destroyed the files.
Davis alleged that his superiors' negiligent protection of the
records caused the accident.
   Davis was fired June 8, the day after the destruction was
discovered, the Times reported.
   The destroyed material included internal memos and
word-processing documents from Exxon Shipping Co., which owns the
Exxon Valdez, and Exxon USA, the newspaper said.
   Baily said the documents cover a two-week period about six to
eight weeks after the spill, a time when Exxon was determining how
to defend its actions.
   Loss of the documents could affect others who may become involved
in lawsuits against the oil company, such as fishermen, businesses
and Alaska natives hurt by the spill, he said.
   If the documents cannot be recovered ``there are a variety of
sanctions that could be imposed'' by the courts against Exxon, but
their severity would depend on what the documents held, Baily said.

   For 8-year-old Nicholas Naudain, marching in
a Fourth of July parade was fun but exhausting even though the route
was only around the rooftop garden of the city's only emergency
shelter for families.
   ``My feet are tired,'' he said after the festivities began
Tuesday atop Raphael House in the rundown Tenderloin neighborhood.
   But he quickly added that the event was not boring.
   In another Independence Day celebration, volunteers distributed
soup, carrot cake and more than 100 watermelons to homeless people
in a makeshift campground in front of City Hall.
   About 125 people turned out for the Raphael House party, which
included balloons, streamers and a 20-member marching band. Flags
waved, cymbals crashed and batons twirled as the parade began. A
flag-raising ceremony followed, and then everyone joined in for a
spirited rendition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   ``They usually go all out on celebrations, they really do,'' said
Nicholas' mother, Terry Naudain, 34, who is staying at the shelter
for the second time since 1982.
   After marching in the parade as part of a cardboard fire engine,
Nicholas summed up the meaning of Independence Day.
   ``To me, it's to have a good time, don't worry about nothing.''
   Red, white and blue balloons and streamers created a patriotic
mood on the rooftop, which was filled with blooming petunias,
gladiolas and geraniums.
   Rosa Armas, who lived at the shelter with her three young
children last winter, returned for the party.
   ``This is like our family,'' she said. ``I don't have family
here. They love to come here.''
   Maria Phillips, 53, who lives a couple of blocks away, said she
attends the celebration every year.
   ``It's just beautiful,'' she said. ``It's a perfect place here
because they do an awful lot for the people. It's only an emergency
situation and it's better than being out on the streets.''
   At City Hall picnic, Reginald Carnegie, 38, said he was impressed
by the hospitality.
   ``I've been a lot of places and this is one of the few around
that tries to do anything for the homeless people,'' said Carnegie,
who arrived in San Francisco from Florida last week and rented a
room nearby.
   ``It beats eating air, you know.''

<HEAD>Ruling Party Recognizes First Gubernatorial Defeat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which
has ruled Mexico for all its 60 years, on Tuesday recognized its
first defeat in a gubernatorial election, the government news agency
Notimex said.
   The party acknowledged that the conservative National Action
Party had won in Baja California in Sunday's regional balloting.
   Luis Donaldo Colosio, president of the governing party's national
executive committee, made the announcement in Mexico City.
   Since its founding in 1929, the party has never lost a
presidential election. It lost its first senate seats in the July 6
elections.
   Ernesto Ruffo, the National Action candidate, and Margarita
Ortega of the governing party, known as PRI, each had claimed
victory in the Baja California race. The electoral commission has
until Sunday to announce official returns.
   ``I feel like the governor because of the support of the
people,'' Ruffo, 37, a former mayor of Ensenada said earlier. He
claimed he was leading Mrs. Ortega by a 3-2 margin, with roughly
half the ballots counted.
   Ruffo also claimed his party, known as PAN, was winning the races
for mayors in the Baja California cities of Tijuana and Ensenada.
   Mrs. Ortega, 38, had claimed she was winning by a 9 percent
margin, with 87 percent of the votes counted and that her party's
candidates were leading in those two mayoral races.
   PRI also claimed it was winning a majority in the state
legislature, which has 15 elected members plus four chosen though
proportional representation.
   Opposition parties had said that if such claims were backed by
the electoral commission, they would consider the election stolen.
   The electoral commission, independent voting observers and PAN
all agreed there were numerous irregularities in the voting, such as
theft of ballot boxes, obstruction of opposition observers and the
early closing of some polling places.
   Sunday's elections in Baja California and four other Mexican
states were considered a test for President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, who has promised clean elections in Mexico, even if it
means losses for the PRI.
   Two of the other states holding elections _ Zacatecas and
Campeche _ are traditional PRI strongholds, but in Michoacan the
leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party led by native son and former
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was claiming victory.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party claimed it had won at least 14
of Michoacan's 24 seats in the state assembly.
   In Ciudad Juarez, throngs of disgruntled PAN members staged a
90-minute demonstration Monday night at the local election board to
protest massive irregularities in the Chihuahua state elections for
mayors.
   PAN spokesman Gustavo Elizondo and other party leaders cited at a
news conference dozens of reports of voters having their thumbs
stamped with presumably indelible ink that could be washed off,
allowing them to vote more than once.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Activists Planning State-by-State Campaign</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists planning a state-by-state legislative
campaign for abortion rights say they have little hope that a deeply
divided Supreme Court will protect their interests.
   ``We will do everything we can to make this the issue of the
coming elections,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women. ``We will seek to build a political army all
across the country.''
   The aim, she said Tuesday, is to convince legislators they will
pay a heavy price for supporting anti-abortion laws.
   The high court's willingness to scrap the constitutional right to
abortion it established 16 years ago appears now to hinge
precariously on the vote of Sandra Day O'Connor, the only woman in
the nation's history to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
   Abortion rights groups say they have little reason to hope she
will vote to bar states from enacting tougher and tougher laws to
limit abortions.
   ``She never met a regulation she doesn't like,'' said Sarah
Weddington, the lawyer who successfully argued the 1973 case of Roe
vs. Wade that legalized abortion.
   ``We can't look to the courts for our protection on this any
more,'' said Patricia Ireland of the National Organization for Women.
   Those assessments were prompted by the high court's ruling Monday
that barely stopped short of letting states outlaw abortions.
   In a series of 5-4 votes, the justices ended their 1988-89 term
by removing some of the shackles that barred states from regulating
most abortions for 16 years. In its next term beginning in October,
the court could give states even broader power.
   The court agreed to study three new abortion disputes, giving it
a new opportunity to overturn Roe vs. Wade in 1990.
   ``There is no longer a majority on the court to support Roe,''
said Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Abortion opponents happily agreed.
   ``Roe's days are numbered,'' said Randall Terry of Operation
Rescue.
   O'Connor is one of five justices who have expressed hostility to
the 1973 ruling. In 1983 she said its central premise _ permitting
greater state control as a woman's pregnancy proceeds _ has ``no
justification in the law or logic.''
   But if the 16-year-old structure is tottering, O'Connor has not
yet announced a willingness to topple it.
   The time is not ripe to discard it, she said, choosing instead to
uphold Missouri regulations limiting abortion rights on narrower
grounds.
   She voted, for example, to let states require various medical
tests to determine whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is
``viable'' or capable of surviving outside the womb.
   The court's 1973 ruling allowed states to make it a crime to
abort a viable fetus _ but the justices then drew the viability line
at 24 weeks.
   The tests ordered by Missouri ``are to be performed when
viability is possible,'' O'Connor said.
   That could add $150 or more to the cost of an abortion. But,
O'Connor said, that ``does not impose an undue burden on a woman's
abortion decision.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia's separate concurring opinion expressed
frustration with the caution of his fellow conservatives on the
court.
   ``It thus appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortion
law, constructed overnight in Roe vs. Wade, must be disassembled
doorjamb by doorjamb and never entirely brought down, no matter how
wrong it may be,'' Scalia wrote.
   Others on the court surely ready to dismantle the 16-year-old
ruling are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R.
White and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The addition of Kennedy to the court last year has shifted the
balance of power on abortion and other issues as well.
   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are appointees of former President
Reagan, who also elevated Rehnquist to chief justice to lead the
swing to conservatism. White, named by former President Kennedy,
votes with them on many key cases.

<HEAD>Doctors, Lawyers Should Halt Drug Use by Colleagues, Bennett Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and lawyers may not be scoring crack in
the ghettoes, but some of them are using drugs illegally, and drug
czar William J. Bennett says they'd better get control of their
professions.
   ``These are people who make a lot of money, who exercise a lot of
influence in society,'' Bennett said in an interview. ``They're role
models. Doctors and lawyers, they have a special kind of status. One
stands for health, one stands for lawfulness. There's no good excuse
here.''
   Bennett said he wants law firms and hospitals to conduct drug
testing if management thinks an abuse problem might exist. He said
he plans to include such a suggestion in his national drug strategy,
due in early September.
   About one-third of the physicians who lose their licenses are
tossed out of the profession because of illegal use of drugs,
according to one official. Both the American Medical Association and
the American Bar Association run programs for their drug- and
alcohol-impaired colleagues.
   Dr. Bryant Galusha of the Fort Worth-based Federation of State
Medical Boards estimated that at least 35 percent of the medical
disciplinary actions reported are related directly or indirectly to
controlled substances. The vast majority of the cases involve a
doctor's personal drug abuse, he said.
   In 1986, Galusha said, the federation was notified of 2,302
disciplinary actions against physicians nationwide. Of those, 458
resulted in license revocation, 528 in suspension and 335 in
probation, he said.
   ABA officials said they had no similar records on lawyers in
trouble.
   Bennett, who held separate meetings recently with ABA President
Robert Raven and the AMA's chief executive officer, Dr. James H.
Sammons, said such professionals should meet the same standards he's
trying to set for athletes: ``One strike you're in trouble, and two
strikes you're out.''
   ``If you're serious about this thing, you don't just go battering
down doors in the inner cities,'' said Bennett, director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``To those who have been
given much, much is expected.''
   The ABA and the AMA are voluntary organizations that do not have
the power to discipline their members by lifting credentials, and
neither Raven nor Sammons indicated he would advocate Bennett's
``two strikes you're out'' policy.
   Instead, they espoused treatment for drug abusers. Keeping
records on those who seek help for such problems might make them
hesitant to seek treatment, they added.
   While heads of some law firms might be considering drug testing,
Raven said he doesn't believe it's necessary, especially in the
larger firms.
   ``You have people watching each other,'' Raven said. ``If a
person has a serious problem, either in alcoholism or in drugs,
that's going to be reflected in their work, their attendance, their
punctuality, everything else.''
   However, Dr. Dorynne Czechowicz of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse said even people who are trained to discover such problems
have a difficult time recognizing drug or alcohol abuse by patients.
   The key problem for the legal profession is whether an attorney's
drug use is causing a client to be neglected or a case mishandled,
Raven said.
   ``In many states now, they have procedures where they can move in
and protect the client, and that's very important,'' he said. At the
same time, he said, concern for a client's welfare might hinder
immediate action against the attorney.
   Galusha said medical boards have been criticized for not revoking
more doctors' licenses because of incompetency. But he said the
boards, faced with extreme legal hurdles to prove incompetency,
often will target the physician's use of controlled substances as an
easier way to revoke the license.
   ``The public must come first, not the physician,'' he said.
   The extent of drug abuse among professionals is unclear. Surveys
by the NIDA check whether respondents are employed, but not what
jobs they have.
   The addiction rate for all groups of people _ and all kinds of
substances, including alcohol _ is about 10 percent, said Dr.
Douglas Talbott, who says his drug treatment facility in Atlanta has
``treated more physicians than anyone in the free world.''
   Among health professionals, the addiction rate is 17 percent to
19 percent, he said, with only 10 percent to 15 percent of those
people addicted solely to alcohol.

<HEAD>US Official Hits Use of Aid Money in Egypt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not a single family benefited during the first
10 years of a $134 million U.S.-Egyptian program to provide housing
for low-income people near Cairo, according to the Agency for
International Development.
   A new report to Congress by AID Inspector General Herbert L.
Beckington complains about U.S. aid operations in Egypt. At $2.3
billion a year, Egypt gets more U.S. aid than any country except
Israel.
   The project begun in 1978 at Helwan, about 18 miles south of
Cairo, was to cost $160 million, shared equally by the two
governments. By March 31, 1988, the United States had spent $71
million and Egypt $63 million and not one family had occupied an
apartment, the report said.
   John Riddle, a spokesman for the agency, said that since
Beckington's report was written, 205 families have moved into 158
apartment units. The project had been planned to include 4,000 units.
   The United States will stop paying money into the project after
Sept. 30, Riddle said.
   The AID report said questionable management decisions were
responsible for problems in the housing project. There were disputes
about who would be eligible to get a house, and planners apparently
never considered how money was to be collected from the occupants,
the report said.
   Riddle said the United States is spending 10 million Egyptian
pounds (about $3.9 million) to hire local contractors for what he
called a ``lessons learned analysis'' of the project.
   The money is coming from the sales of U.S. goods sent as aid to
Egypt. Money from such sales usually goes into a joint account
managed by the two governments.
   Beckington also complained about the agency's system for checking
on the $3.4 billion worth of goods sent to Egypt since 1975.
   ``AID had not verified the arrival in Egypt of more than $283
million in AID-financed commodities through April 30, 1988,'' the
report said, adding that the problem has persisted although it was
mentioned in previous reports.
   It also faulted AID's accounting for more than $11 million in
Egyptian currency collected from sales of medical products.
   The report, submitted to Congress every six months, covered Oct.
1, 1988, to March 31 of this year.
   Beckington praised as well-managed the project to improve the
power station at the Aswan High Dam, to which the agency is
contributing $140 million. The dam was built with Soviet help during
the 1960s after the United States rejected the project.
   The Egyptian government has not submitted required reports,
Beckington said, so his agency cannot say if Egypt is contributing
the equivalent of $12 million as promised.
   Despite aid given by the United States and the Soviet Union,
Egypt is in poor economic condition. Its citizens have an average
income of about $680 a year and one of the Third World's largest
foreign debts, $43 billion.
   The government of President Hosni Mubarak is falling behind on
its payments. Unless it makes a payment on the $4.5 billion military
debt to the United States by November, U.S. law requires that
further aid be halted.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Boating is a Presidential Sport</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every time President Bush goes out in
his 28-foot speedboat, ``Fidelity,'' a small navy of power boats
accompanies him.
   Bush is constantly on the 28-foot Cigarette-brand racing boat
during his vacation periods, and local boaters regard his sleek
blue-hulled craft with white and red trim as a familiar sight.
   The president was headed for his boat on Tuesday, in fact, when
he was told by Secret Service agents of former President Reagan's
horseback riding accident in Mexico.
   Television crews following Bush caught a picture of the president
on his boat talking on the telephone. But White House aides denied
that was how he learned of Reagan's accident; instead, he was just
talking to a staff member.
   Just as Reagan relaxed by riding horses, Bush takes obvious
pleasure in bouncing through Atlantic waves in his boat, with a
specially designed hull for ocean racing.
   The smaller boats pursuing the presidential craft everywhere it
goes include several Coast Guard cutters, two Secret Service power
boats _ both products of drug raids _ and a half dozen or so power
boats leased by news agencies. Also, sightseeing boaters often come
along for the ride, just to catch a glimpse of the president behind
the wheel.
   But boats are kept at a safe 250 yards behind Bush by Coast Guard
cutters. Those inching closer receive stern warnings over
loudspeakers.
   Bush bought his boat in 1973 for $15,000, a fraction of the cost
of new Cigarette boats, which can run well over $100,000. Bush sold
stock in the Fidelity Printing Co. of Houston to pay for the boat _
thus, the name ``Fidelity.''
   With twin 185-horsepower inboard engines, the boat can zip along
at speeds up to 50 mph. And Bush seems to enjoy hitting the
throttle, zipping between rocks and leaving the chase boats far
behind in his spray.
   As he told a well-wisher in town the other day, ``I hope we get
out on the water, do some fun stuff.''
   Bush did ``fun stuff'' for the duration of his five-day
Independence Day holiday here.
   Boating shared billing with jogging, tennis, swimming and
frequent golf games, and reporters covering the vacation White House
often felt they were covering sporting events.
   One who didn't think boating with the president of the United
States was ``fun stuff'' was French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Bush tried repeatedly to get Mitterrand out on his boat when the
French leader was his guest here in May. However, Mitterrand, who
reportedly gets seasick, declined. At one point, Bush brought the
boat around in a final effort to get the French leader out for a
spin.
   Bush wound up going out himself, leaving Mitterrand behind to
work on a speech.
   Bush has promised residents of this seacoast resort he would be a
``good neighbor,'' and said he would drive his boat slowly _ at
least in the narrow channel leading into downtown Kennebunkport.
   But he doesn't observe any speed restrictions in the open
Atlantic off his compound that sits on a peninsula, Walker's Point,
jutting out into the sea.
   In fact, one of Bush's favorite tricks is to unnerve his guests
by bringing his boat full throttle into the cove by his house,
seeming to head straight toward a stone wall, and cutting his
engines at the very last moment.
   Then he brakes the boat in a tight circle and, in a fury of spray
and centrifugal force, brings the craft to a docile stop right
alongside his wooden dock.
   But Bush didn't go out in his boat on Monday, when he treated
neighbors to a 15-minute fireworks display from his property.
   The president stayed ashore, with what aide Marlin Fitzwater

   Fitzwater and many other senior White House aides, who didn't
make the cut, watched the fireworks from a tour boat that bobbed in
the Atlantic along with hundreds of smaller craft to watch the
presidential pyrotechnics.
   Several dozen reporters were also on the boat, which was paid for
by the Republican National Committee.
   At first, White House aides did not disclose who had paid for the
boat _ and when it turned out to be the RNC, a number of reporters
refused to get aboard.
   Others who took the trip insisted on paying for their share.
   In any event, Bush was out again on Tuesday evening, boating for
several hours in heavy seas, one final fling at ``fun stuff'' before
returning to Washington and the work of governing a nation.

<HEAD>Priest Who Started Black Catholic Congregation Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspended Roman Catholic priest says he'll
continue leading his unsanctioned African American Catholic
Congregation, contending that Washington's archbishop ``has failed
to deal with racism'' within the church.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings is forbidden to preach, celebrate
mass or administer any of the Roman Catholic Church's sacraments
including baptism, weddings or holy communion, church spokeswoman
Eileen Marks said Tuesday.
   The suspension was imposed by Cardinal James Hickey, archbishop
of the Washington diocese.
   But Stallings said Tuesday he will continue to hold Sunday
services for his new congregation, adding, ``The suspension only
affects my duties with the Roman Catholic Church.''
   ``The cardinal has failed to deal with racism in the Catholic
Church and hasn't responded to issues I have brought to his
attention,'' he said in an interview with WHUR radio.
   Stallings celebrated the African American church's first worship
ceremony in the chapel of a Washington law school on Sunday.
   Marks said Hickey's letter to Stallings, in which he imposed the
suspension, said the Sunday service was ``a public act of
disobedience.''
   Hickey said Stallings' act in establishing a separate group was
``a step toward separating yourself from the unity of the Catholic
Church.''
   The letter from the cardinal said the decision to suspend
Stallings was made partly to help him turn away from a
``destructive'' course of action. Marks said Hickey wants to leave
open the possibility of communication with Stallings despite the
suspension.
   Stallings said he created the new congregation, also known as the
Imani Temple, because he believes the Catholic Church is not
responsive to the cultural and spiritual needs of black parishioners.
   Sunday's ceremony was attended by about 500 people and included
traditional Catholic prayers and liturgy along with elements
borrowed from African and Southern black revival traditions. Black
representatives of other faiths, including Baptists and Muslims,
attended to show support for Stallings' move.
   Stallings, who announced plans for his separate congregation last
month, said Sunday, ``The church can't throw me out, and even if
they do throw me out, I have my own opinion ... they have theirs.''

<HEAD>Fed Likely to Further Loosen Credit Policy</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Should stand; closed-door meeting begins at 3 p.m.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With growing fears of a possible recession, the
Federal Reserve is likely to further loosen credit policy and drive
a variety of consumer and business loan rates lower, many private
economists predict.
   Analysts believe fixed-rate mortgage loans will soon dip below 10
percent and other consumer loans will drop by one-half percentage
point before the summer is over as the central bank struggles to
keep the aging economic recovery alive.
   ``The Fed has a plate full of statistics suggesting that a wise
insurance policy against a recession would be to make another easing
move,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co.
of Chicago.
   The forecasts of a looser credit policy came as Fed officials
gathered for the start today of two important days of closed-door
meetings to map monetary strategy for the rest of the year.
   Decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of
members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the
12 regional Fed bank presidents, will not be revealed until July 20
when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan delivers the central
bank's midyear policy update to Congress.
   The Fed in March 1988 launched a credit-tightening effort which
drove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points in an effort to
dampen growing inflationary pressures by reducing borrowing demands.
   But last month, in a major policy shift, the central bank sent a
key interest rate, the federal funds rate, down by 0.25 percentage
point to around 9.50 percent. The funds rate is the interest that
banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   Many private economists believe the Fed will decide to lower the
funds rate by another 0.25 percentage point in July. Similar small
declines would be likely in the following months if the economic
statistics show that the early-year spurt in inflation is moderating
and the economy is remaining sluggish, the economists say.
   The central bank has been struggling to engineer a ``soft
landing'' where growth slows enough to dampen inflation but without
causing a recession.
   Last week's big drop in the stock market was blamed on growing
fears that the country is headed for a downturn later this year,
based on statistics showing weak consumer spending and a big slump
in factory orders.
   ``The economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underlies
the need for the Fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``Failure to act soon may turn the soft landing into
a recession.''
   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group, an
economic consulting firm, said, ``The Fed cannot ignore the various
signs showing we have a very sluggish economy.''
   ``Clearly, the risk of a recession is higher but my guess is that
the Fed believes we can get by without one'' through gradual moves
to lower rates, Chimerine said.
   Mortgage rates are already falling. Fixed-rate mortgages, which
peaked at 11.24 percent in late March, dropped to a nationwide
average of 10.07 percent last week, according to a survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, another
forecasting firm, predicted that 30-year mortgages will soon fall
below 10 percent and decline to around 9.5 percent by September.
   Other economists forecast a further one-half percentage point
drop in banks' prime lending rate which was cut to 11 percent in
early June, its first reduction in more than a year.
   The prime rate is traditionally considered a benchmark for
business loans, but it now influences a variety of consumer loans,
including home equity loans.
   Various economists said while they are looking for further signs
of easing credit from the Fed, they do not expect anything as
dramatic as a cut in the Fed's discount rate, the interest it
charges to make direct loans to financial institutions.

<HEAD>A Look at the Dairy Cow of the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical dairy cow of the 21st century will
be a much larger producer by today's standards, and might even turn
out some kinds of tailor-made milk, according to Agriculture
Department scientists.
   H. Duane Norman, animal research leader at the department's
Agricultural Research Service facility in Beltsville, Md., said
herds that yield as much as 40,000 pounds of milk per cow annually
(about 4,651 gallons) can be expected in the next century.
   Nationally, 1988 milk production averaged 14,213 pounds per cow,
or about 1,653 gallons.
   ``We've had individual cows already that produced 50,000
pounds,'' Norman said in the current issue of Agricultural Research
magazine. ``In 1945, we had 25 million dairy cows in the United
States; today we have about 10 million. But the milk yield per cow
is up from 4,600 pounds to an average of 14,000 pounds today.''
   The most controversial development is bovine somatotropin, or
BST, the so-called bovine growth hormone that is awaiting clearance
by the Food and Drug Administration before it can be used by dairy
farmers.
   Cows produce BST naturally in their pituitary glands, and it can
be made synthetically. Several companies are working on versions of
the chemical.
   Another Beltsville scientist, Henry F. Tyrell, said BST typically
would boost a cow's milk output by 15 percent, although on a
short-term basis it could rise by as much as 50 percent.
   ``I'd say we'll see basically a continuation of the same trends
of the last 50 years,'' Tyrell said. ``What I see is more emphasis
on tailoring milk to meet specific product demands.''
   Genetically, it is possible to change the relative proportions of
proteins in milk _ the casein, albumin and globulins.
   ``Part of the reason cheeses are different from each other is the
various proteins in the milk,'' Tyrell said. ``It's in this area,
altering the proportions in the milk for specific products, that
we'll see a change.''
   Vernon G. Pursel, a reproductive physiologist at Beltsville, said
he and others have been working for a year on targeting components
to the mammary glands of farm animals _ and that could mean some
rather exotic results.
   ``Depending on what gene you insert, you could have some of the
rare medical proteins produced in the mammary gland,'' Pursel said.
``These special proteins could be extracted from the milk and
purified.''
   One example, he said, is the blood-clotting factor used to treat
hemophilia, a rare protein that some day might be extracted from
milk.
   ``During the past year, we've transfered a gene for a mouse
protein into pigs. If the mouse gene functions correctly, the mouse
protein will be present in the milk produced by our transgenic
pigs,'' Pursel said.
   The next step, he said, will be to connect the regulatory part of
the mouse gene to part of a gene for rare medical protein so it can
be produced in the milk.
   ``The final step will be to transfer such a gene into the dairy
cow,'' Pursel said. ``If the regulatory part of the mouse gene
works, it could also be used to modify the composition of the milk.''

   A newly discovered bee with a long tongue is
turning out to be a friend of rabbiteye blueberry producers, says
the Agriculture Department.
   The department said Monday that honey bees can't pollinate
rabbiteye blueberries because their tongues are too short. But the
new bee's tongue is longer and can reach into the blueberry's flower
for nectar.
   As it probes the flower with its long tongue, the bee also buzzes
it to loosen a cloud of pollen, said Jerry A. Payne, an entomologist
with the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   When the bee moves on, it carries pollen from one blueberry
flower to another, achieving pollination. Payne, who works at the
agency's Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory, Byron,
Ga., said in a report issued here that poor crops of rabbiteye
blueberries often result from poor cross pollination.
   The ground-nesting bee, Habropoda loboriosa, was found during a
three-year study with Auburn University in Alabama. The bee is
prevalent in the southeastern United States where rabbiteye
blueberries are grown on approximately 5,000 acres.
   Payne said the bee, which has been named the Southeastern
blueberry bee, is larger than a honey bee but smaller than a bumble
bee. The female has a black face minus a cream-colored dot that
distinguishes the male. Only the female gathers pollen.
   Depending on the season, consumers pay from $2 to $5 a pint for
rabbiteye blueberries.
   ``We don't know much about the bee's nesting habits,'' Payne
said. ``Therefore, we don't have any way yet to reintroduce it if
nests are destroyed. So we advise growers not to use insecticides
when blueberries bloom.''

   The Agriculture Department has asked for public
comments for designing the 1990 feed grains program.
   Officials say that one of the main items will involve how much
land farmers will be required to set aside in order to qualify for
price supports and other benefits on 1990 crops of corn, sorghum,
oats and, if designated, barley.
   The 1985 farm law requires the annual set-aside to be at least
12.5 percent and no more than 20 percent of a producer's acreage
base when corn inventories exceed the level of 2 billion bushels at
the beginning of the season. The set-aside was 20 percent for 1989.
   Comments can be sent by Sept. 5 to: Director, Commodity Analysis
Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O. Box 2415, Washington D.C.,

<HEAD>Education Department Opposes NEA Resolution on School Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Education Association is drawing
criticism from the Bush administration for its resolution opposing
many plans that let parents choose which public schools their
children will attend.
   Such plans should not be mandated by the states or federal
government, according to a resolution adopted Tuesday by the union.
However, the group did not oppose the idea if it is adopted by local
school authorities.
   The union said it continues to support ``alternative programs ...
for specific purposes'' such as magnet schools designed to promote
desegregation.
   Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders said through spokesman Tom
Lyon the vote was ``very disappointing. All students deserve access
to a quality education _ and choice will make that happen. But
apparently the NEA doesn't even understand the concept.''
   ``The president and the (education) secretary have called choice
the cornerstone for rebuilding American education. Parents want
choice; students need it _ now,'' Sanders said.
   The resolution, adopted by the 8,500 delegates at the NEA's
annual Representative Assembly, indicated the organization is
concerned about whether all students can receive free, high-quality
education under a choice program mandated by a state or the federal
government.
   Bush administration education officials had hoped that more
moderate forces within the NEA would prevail.
   Sanders and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos have argued that
allowing parents to choose their child's school will force schools
to compete and improve.
   However, opponents say schools could become weakened or
re-segregated as students leave. Some choice programs do not provide
transportation for students and most wind up draining funds from the
schools left behind, they contend.
   Delegates representing the nearly 2 million NEA members had
considered proposals ranging from strong opposition to a relatively
moderate statement opposing choice programs that foster inequities
or substandard education for some students.
   The NEA on Tuesday also announced the creation of four ``learning
laboratories'' in school districts in Memphis, Tenn.; Chaska, Minn.;
Marshalltown, Iowa, and Westerly, R.I.
   The four districts will experiment with ways to give teachers and
other local personnel more control over their schools, on the
premise that reform without teacher input is bound to fail.
   School boards and superintendents are cooperating with the
effort, which will bring the districts $280,000 this year in grants
and technical aid from the NEA. Each experiment is expected to last
at least five years and eventually serve as a model for other
districts.
   Since beginning its convention Sunday, the NEA also has decided
to:
   _Ask television stations and newspapers to put the names of
states on their weather maps. The proposal came from the Montana
delegation in the interest of improving geographic literacy.
   _Oppose Channel 1, a television news program with commercials
designed for classroom use that has been denounced by several other
educational organizations.
   _Wage an aggressive campaign for better teacher pay, including
television spots, press conferences and newspaper and magazine
articles.
   _Recommend a series of policies for the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, which is developing standards for
voluntary teacher certification.

   Former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. has been
hospitalized after suffering chest pains.
   Brown, 55, was undergoing tests at Humana Hospital-Audubon,
hospital spokeswoman Denise Damron said Tuesday. He was accompanied
by his wife, Phyllis George Brown, when he entered the hospital.
   Pat Mulloy, Brown's lawyer, said Brown checked into a hospital in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., late Friday and was flown to Louisville on
Tuesday morning.
   Brown, governor from 1979 to 1983, underwent triple bypass heart
surgery at the end of his term and developed serious lung
complications.
   He withdrew from his race against Walter Huddleston for the U.S.
Senate in 1984 because of doctors' orders.
   Brown also had surgery to replace his hip in 1986, a side effect
of treatment from his heart surgery.
   In 1987, he finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary to Wallace Wilkinson.

   President Reagan was recuperating
today from scrapes and bruises after a being thrown by a bucking
horse during what he called ``my own private rodeo.''
   The 78-year-old Reagan was flown to Fort Huachuca's Raymond W.
Bliss Army Community Hospital after the spill at a ranch in the
northern Mexico state of Sonora, said his spokesman, Mark Weinberg.
   After four hours of treatment, Reagan returned to the ranch,
where he has been vacationing since Saturday, officials said.
   Although Reagan did not suffer any serious injury, doctors
suggested he stay at the hospital overnight, officials said.
   Reagan declined, so doctors assigned the hospital's chief nurse,
Lt. Col. Paul Farineau, to accompany Reagan back to the ranch that's
owned by William Wilson, a friend and former U.S. ambassador to the
Vatican.
   The former president plans to celebrate his wife's birthday there
on Thursday before returning to his Los Angeles home at the end of
the week, Weinberg said.
   Capt. Juan Lopez, a U.S. Army doctor who examined Reagan, said he
planned a follow-up check today in Mexico.
   Lopez said he told Reagan to stay away from stressful exercise
for the rest of the week.
   While at the hospital, Reagan made jokes and did not complain of
any pain, Lopez said.
   The spill occurred Tuesday morning.
   ``The horse Reagan was riding bucked wildly several times on a
rocky downhill slope and eventually stumbled,'' Weinberg said.
   The spokesman said Reagan is ``an excellent rider and he held on
quite a while.'' He said Reagan joked that the accident was ``my own
private rodeo.'' In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, the
spokesman said that he didnb't know if the horse suffered any
injuries.
   Lt. Gen. Thurmond D. Rodgers, ranking officer at Fort Huachuca,
said Reagan told him to ```make sure people know that I was thrown
from the horse. I did not fall.'''
   A U.S. Army helicopter flew Reagan to Fort Huachuca from the
ranch near Cananea, Mexico, said Maj. Dennis Seely, a base spokesman.
   June Scobee Rodgers, widow of space shuttle Challenger pilot Dick
Scobee and now wife of the fort's ranking officer, dropped by the
hospital to give her regards.
   After about four hours, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, left the
hospital and returned to Mexico via the Army helicopter.
   Rodgers said Reagan was in good spirits on his departure, saying
nothing to personnel, but saluting as he left.
   While vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush was
informed of Reagan's accident by the Secret Service just before Bush
went boating, White House spokesman Bill Harlow said.
   ``The president was relieved to hear that President Reagan is
OK,'' Harlow said. ``He'll be calling him at some point.''

   The U.S. dollar edged down today against the
Japanese yen while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The dollar ended trading at 140.20 yen, down 0.75 yen from
Tuesday's 140.95 yen. It opened at 141.20 yen and ranged between
139.85 yen and 141.25 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 119.33 points, or 0.36
percent, finishing at 33,309.71. The index lost 46.04 points Tuesday.
   Dealers said trading in Tokyo was mixed with selling and buying,
after the index quickly gained more than 130 points in early trading.
   A dealer with New Japan Securities Co. said Japanese investors
were cautious due to concerns over elections for the upper house of
Parliament scheduled for July 23. The governing Liberal Democratic
Party is expected to lose many of its seats in the upper house of
Parliament, and possibly give up its majority.
   In currency dealings, the dollar fell as market players sold it
to buy European currencies, said Minori Takeuchi, a trader with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Since discount rate hikes of major European currencies last
week, the dollar has become weaker as investors have been less
attracted by it,'' she said, ``This also resulted in the dollar's
weakness against the yen.''
   Last week's concerted discount rate increases in Europe included
a 0.5 percentage point increase in West Germany and France.
   Ms. Takeuchi said Japanese investors would continue to make
technical adjustments and avoid major moves until Friday, when U.S.
unemployment figures for June are to be released.

   In the living room, investigators found the body of Velasquez's
26-year-old wife, Dora Funes, and 12-year-old daughter, Neydy. Both
also were shot in the head.
   Boyle said the shootings apparently resulted ``from a continuing

Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts invited
Shen and other Chinese students to set a floral Goddess of Democracy
in front of the Old State House.
   The statue, created of plastic foam covered with white flowers,
was a replica of the one Chinese students erected in Tiananmen
Square.
   Standing among the uniformed Artillery members, Shen read his own
declaration of independence.
   ``On this spot ... British troops opened fire on peaceful
citizens,'' Shen said. ``People died. People were hurt. But it
sparked the American struggle for independence.
   ``Exactly one month ago in my country, troops controlled by the
Li Peng regime opened fire on a peaceful civilian protest. I do not
believe that the Tiananmen Square massacre was the end of the
democracy movement in China.
   ``It was the beginning _ a beginning that will lead to a new
China, a China governed by the people and for the people.''
   Elsewhere, seven Chinese students at the University of Tulsa
announced at a flag-raising ceremony they want political asylum in
the United States.
   ``We feel very strongly, if we go back _ this year, next year or
any year _ we really face big danger,'' said Guohua Zheng, a
25-year-old graduate student in petroleum engineering at the
Oklahoma school. The Immigration and Naturalization Service had no
immediate comment.
   In Boston, the Chinese students were a new twist on the
traditional Fourth of July celebrations by the artillery company, a
militia founded in 1638.
   The Old State House was erected in 1713 as the seat of the
British colonial government. On March 5, 1770, five unarmed
Americans were killed there while demonstrating against the British.
Six years later, the artillery company's Thomas Crafts read the
Declaration of Independence from the balcony of the Old State House.
   On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Joseph A. Milano read the declaration. The
artillery company, joined by several other militias in colonial-era
costumes, then held a moment of silence for those who died in
Tiananmen Square and for American servicemen who died in wars.
   Milano said he personally paid for the statue but declined to say
how much in cost. ``Just say it was about a dollar for every flower
and there weren't less than 2,000,'' he said.
   Milano said he has visited China three times since 1983 and
decided to invite the Chinese to take part in the American ceremony
because he was moved by the historical similarities.
   ``It was American patriots at that time and now it's a very
similar thing,'' Milano said. ``We brought China to Boston.''
   Shen, who will not say how he escaped from China, used the
ceremony to protest the presumed arrest of a friend, student Wang
Dan.
   Shen made it clear he is not advocating the armed revolt embraced
by the American colonists.
   ``For a thousand years in China, it's always been one dynasty
changing into another dynasty, one violence into another violence,''
Shen said. ``This movement is different. It is non-violent.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Takes Seats Beside Communists, Criticizes Economic Mishandling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: To ADD Solidarity foreign aid proposal, INSERT one graf after
14th, `Unclear now ...' Picks up 15th, `On Tuesday ...' ^By DEBORAH G.

<TEXT>
   Taking seats beside their former Communist
jailers in the new parliament, Solidarity legislators savored the
historic moment and immediately took the government to task for
mishandling the economy.
   Not only did the free trade union movement claim the spoils of
its June election victory on Tuesday. It also saw the discredited
government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski formally resign.
   In his first speech as a deputy, Solidarity veteran Jacek Kuron
lashed into Rakowski for helping precipitate an economic crisis in
which the government's ``chaotic policy caused only social unrest.''
   Rakowski looked on uncomfortably from a balcony.
   Kuron, who spent nine years in jail for opposition activities,
noted that Communist authorities refrained from increasing prices
during the election campaign, then ordered price rises after the
humiliating electoral defeat.
   Despite running uncontested, Rakowski and other key members of
the ruling Communist coalition were denied seats in the new
parliament.
   In the June balloting, Solidarity-backed candidates won all but
one of the races the opposition was allowed to contest. Theirs
became the first opposition movement to enter an East bloc
parliament since the postwar Communist takeover.
   ``There were two great moments in my life _ the August 1980
agreements (that created Solidarity) and today,'' said Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, who did not run for office but sat in places of
honor with Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   With the economy in shambles, many analysts say, the same
government that crushed Solidarity with martial law 7{ years ago had
few options but that which it chose _ reinstating the union in April
and trying to work with it.
   Shortages in basic commodities are worse than ever, inflation is
averaging 100 percent per year and servicing the $39 billion foreign
debt is becoming more problematic.
   Price increases in the last two weeks alone raised the cost of
sugar, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, refrigerators and washing
machines.
   The value of the dollar, Poland's most valued currency,
fluctuated wildly before stabilizing after the government announced
a monthlong wage and price freeze as of July 1.
   In postwar Poland, government-mandated price increases have
touched off labor unrest that has toppled regimes and, last August,
led authorities to agree to negotiate Solidarity's reinstatement.
   Unclear now is whether Solidarity will help the government by
assuming part of the responsibility for seeking a way out of the
economic crisis.
   The union is asking Western leaders for $10 billion in new aid
that would allow Poland to continue on its path of reform _
encouraging free market mechanisms and closing money-losing
industries _ without labor turmoil.
   On Tuesday, Rakowski's Cabinet formally submitted its resignation
to the Sejm, or lower house of parliament, which now counts 161
Solidarity deputies among its 460 members. The new Senate, where
Solidarity won 99 of 100 seats, later convened.
   Walesa had a place of honor at the front of the Sejm for the
opening session. Sitting a few yards away was Jaruzelski.
   When the Senate met, the two sat side-by-side at the front of the
chamber and seemed to joke with one another.
   But as leaders of the two chambers were elected and sworn in, an
intense political struggle persisted over who they will elect as
president when they meet in joint session. That election may not
take place until after President Bush visits next week.
   Jaruzelski said Friday that he did not want the post and
recommended Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, but Jaruzelski
was believed to be reconsidering at the urging of some party members.
   Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, crushed Solidarity with a
1981 military crackdown, jailing thousands of Solidarity activists,
including many of the new senators and deputies. Walesa was interned
for 11 months.
   The presidency has been strengthened under Poland's newly amended
constitution, with the president in charge of the army and foreign
relations and empowered to name a prime minister to form a new
government.
   Stanislaw Stomma, at 81 the eldest senator, convened the chamber:
``One is obliged to state the truth in this solemn moment, that the
breakthrough ... we are experiencing is to a major extent the work
of the Solidarity.''
   Sociologist Mikolaj Kozakiewicz of the communist-allied Peasant
Party was voted speaker of the Sejm on Tuesday and law professor
Andrzej Stelmachowski, a Solidarity adviser close to Walesa, was
chosen Senate leader.
   The Sejm is the main lawmaking chamber. The Senate will supervise
its activities and have the right to veto any Sejm acts.
   Under the April agreement that reinstated Solidarity, the ruling
Communist coalition was guaranteed 65 percent of the seats in the
Sejm.

<HEAD>Flag Fervor Marks the Fourth in Wake of Supreme Court Ruling</HEAD>

   Fireworks rocketed through the air and barbecue coals were stoked
as usual. But this July Fourth saw flames of flag fervor fanned more
than ever following the Supreme Court's recent decision allowing the
burning of Old Glory.
   Attention on fiery fights for freedom in Poland and China also
burned brightly as the United States marked its 213th birthday,
while parades extolling patriotism and lampooning other themes
marched through streets across the country.
   And love blazed on the Golden Gate Bridge.
   In one of the nation's naturalization's ceremonies, a federal
judge in Indiana swore in 141 new Americans from 44 countries.
   New citizen Kathryn Weller, a native of Britain who dressed her
children in red, white and blue, had stern words for those who would
desecrate the flag.
   ``If you want to be American you shouldn't burn the flag, and if
they do burn the flag they can leave,'' she said.
   About 200,000 people turned out for a Boston Pops holiday
concert, and the evening of music was capped with fireworks.
   Earlier, the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of
Massachusetts observed Independence Day by honoring the fallen
protesters in China's Tiananmen Square.
   The ceremonial unit joined Shen Tong, a 20-year-old biology
student from Beijing University who is on the Chinese government's
``most wanted'' list, in unveiling a 6-foot-high floral replica of
the ``Goddess of Democracy'' at the site of the Boston Massacre.
   Another country's fight for freedom was the focus in
Philadelphia. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's wife, Danuta, accepted
the city's first Liberty Medal on his behalf and said that years of
struggle for greater freedom in Poland have reached ``a decisive
phase.''
   She accepted the medal and a $100,000 cash award during
ceremonies in front of Independence Hall, where her husband was
hailed for his ``personal triumph'' as the leader of the country's
only independent trade union and popular opposition group.
   In Manchester, Mass., American Legion members staged a ceremonial
burning of tattered flags to protest last month's Supreme Court
ruling upholding an individuals' right to burn the American symbol
under the First Amendment.
   The ceremony, which includes prayers and comments by the
commander, is observed annually by many posts around the country.
   ``It's the only way to destroy (flags) officially under the flag
code,'' said John Comer, past national commander of the American
Legion.
   Vice President Dan Quayle defended the Bush administration's
proposal to make flag burning unconstitutional as he spoke in
Newport News, Va., at a ceremony to honor the Navy's newest attack
submarine.
   ``Too many Americans have laid down their lives in the defense of
freedom to treat this symbol lightly,'' Quayle said.
   North Dakota marked centennial festivities as temperatures across
the state soared to century marks of their own. Bismarck set a
record of 102 Tuesday, topping the 101 set in 1886, three years
before statehood. Party-goers shaded themselves with umbrellas as
they watched the entertainment.
   In a downtown Los Angeles mission, more than 6,000 homeless
people were treated to a Fourth of July lunch including sloppy joes
and watermelon, all served on red, white and blue tablecloths, said
spokesman Walter Contreras.
   ``It's love in action, that's what it is,'' Contreras said.
   New York City celebrated with a spectacular 30-minute nighttime
fireworks display that included a Liberty Bell, space rocket and
star formations and ``America'' written across the sky. About 1
million people turned out despite the threat of rain.
   In the nation's capital, it rained on the estimated 20,000 people
who turned out for the annual parade.
   ``Everybody was smiling and being more congenial because we had
the bad weather as a common denominator,'' said John Shaw, who came
to Washington from Augusta, Maine.
   The Doo-Dah Parade, a tradition in Columbus, Ohio, featuring
off-beat bands and marchers, was highlighted by the Dental Drill
Team, The Marching Fidels _ a group of marchers dressed like Cuban
leader Fidel Castro _ and the Pete Rose Betmobile, combining popular
interest in the new ``Batman'' movie and the Cincinnati Reds
manager's troubles with major league baseball over his alleged
gambling activities.
   As crowds gathered in San Francisco to await fireworks, a couple
celebrated Independence Day by getting married in a windy ceremony
on the Golden Gate Bridge.
   ``We're both hopeless romantics,'' said Jacque Cooper, 22, who
explained beforehand that she and fiance Richard Lane often met on
the bridge to sip champagne and watch the sunset during their
yearlong courtship.
   ``It was like our world. Whatever craziness was on each side of
the bridge, it was our little sanctuary,'' she said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index more than made
up the previous day's losses today, while the dollar fell against
the Japanese yen for the third consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 140.20 yen, down 0.75 yen from Tuesday's
140.95-yen finish. It opened at 141.20 yen and fluctuated between
139.85 yen and 141.25 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 3.75 yen in three trading days.
   Today, investors were selling dollars and buying West German
marks, which resulted in the yen's gain against the dollar, said
Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities, Co.
   ``The yen has been bought back since Monday, when the result of
Sunday's election for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly came out,'' he
said, adding that most investors had sold dollars too heavily before
the election, anticipating the losses by the ruling party.
   On Sunday, the governing Liberal Democratic Party won just 43 of
128 seats in the assembly, losing 20 seats.
   Kanai said investors still were reluctant to buy yen before
elections July 23 for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.
   ``But the dollar-buying incentive is even weaker before the
release of the U.S. unemployment report on Friday, which Japanese
investors think will determine U.S. monetary policy,'' he said.
   Many investors are anticipating an easing of U.S. interest rates,
which makes dollar-denominated investments less attractive to
foreign investors.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 46.04-point loser Tuesday, gained 119.33 points, or 0.36
percent, closing at 33,309.71.
   ``Trading was directionless and inactive,'' said Masahiro
Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   ``Although the Nikkei rose today, the market lacks energy because
Japanese investors feel insecure about making major moves ahead of
the July 23 election,'' he said.
   The governing party is expected to suffer setbacks in the wake of
an influence-peddling scandal that forced former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita to resign, an unpopular sales tax and allegations
that new Prime Minster Sousuke Uno kept paid mistresses.
   Other dealers said the yen's rise against the dollar had
reassured investors and contributed to the index's rise.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, up from Tuesday's 550 million. Among gainers were
steel, shipbuilding and construction issues.

   The producer of the film ``The Thin Blue Line'' is
``hurt and upset'' that the man whose murder conviction was thrown
out after it was questioned in the movie is suing him for rights to
his life story.
   Randall Dale Adams' lawsuit, filed two weeks ago, claims producer
Errol Morris lost his rights to Adams' life story in ecember 1988,
when he failed to exercise a two-year option purchased from Adams
for $10 in December 1986.
   ``Morris left $10 in Adams' commissary account in jail,'' Randy
Schaffer, Adams' lawyer, said late Tuesday. ``A carton of cigarettes
was what that amounted to.''
   Adams was convicted of murdering a Dallas policeman and served 12
years in prison before an appeals court overturned the conviction.
The court acted after the release of the movie, in which another
inmate all but confessed to the slaying. Adams was freed in March,
and prosecutors declined to retry him.
   ``I worked very, very hard for a number of years to see that
justice was done in this case and to see that Randall Adams walked
out of prison,'' Morris said.
   The producer said his profits from the film, which was not widely
distributed, were ``nil'' and added that he is still paying off
debts from the movie.
   Morris said he is willing to renegotiate the rights to Adams'
story. ``There is a desire on my part to settle this quickly and
without acrimony,'' he said.
   Schaffer said Morris doesn't seem to be the problem in current
negotiations aimed at given Adams clear title to any future rights
to his story. He said Morris had sold all rights he owned, including
those of Adams' to Mirimax Productions Co., also listed as a
defendant in the lawsuit.
   ``We just want to clear up who owns the rights,'' Schaffer said.
   Schaffer said his 40-year-old client is not seeking royalties,
only a declaration that he owns the right to his own life story so
he can pursue offers estimated ``in the neighborhood of six
figures.''

<HEAD>Philippine Democracy Under Siege From Mismanagement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with final figure. Picks up 4th,
`But Western ...' ^By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial nations are pledging
billions to save this nation's ``fragile'' democracy. But Philippine
democracy is under siege not only by armed opponents but by forces
of mismanagement and corruption.
   Delegates from 25 countries and international organizations,
meeting in Tokyo, pledged $3.5 billion for 1989 to be channeled into
the Philippines Multilateral Aid Initiative, a U.S.-initiated plan
to revive an economy devastated by 20 years of misrule under ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The figure could reach about $14 billion by 1992. President Bush
has asked Congress for an additional $200 million in annual aid over
the next five years as the American contribution.
   But Western diplomats believe President Corazon Aquino's
government must tackle formidable problems if the money is to be
effective.
   These include an ill-disciplined military, a cumbersome,
inefficient bureaucracy, ineffective courts, and a burgeoning
population that threatens economic gains.
   Western and Filipino experts give the administration high marks
for restoring business confidence, liberalizing imports, disbanding
state monopolies and removing the tax-exempt status from government
enterprises.
   But critics fault Mrs. Aquino for failing to display the vigorous
leadership necessary to exploit the opportunities that Filipinos
enjoyed after toppling the Marcos administration in February 1986.
   Western diplomats say the government has been unable to spend
between $2 and $4 billion in foreign aid because of inefficiency and
bottlenecks in the bureaucracy.
   ``There are a number of favorable trends,'' said one Western
diplomat, on condition of anonymity. ``But they've got a long way to
go. The system is fragile.''
   Abroad, much attention has focused on the communist New People's
Army, the rural-based, 23,000-strong force that has waged a 20-year
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   Rebels operate in 65 of the 73 provinces and have killed up to 65
policemen and soldiers in the Manila area this year.
   But the most serious armed threats have come not from the
insurgents but from disaffected members of the military, who have
launched six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Analysts believe the insurgency persists in part because most
Filipinos have not benefited from the promise of economic and social
justice.
   About half the country's 58 million people live below the
government's definition of poverty _ on less than the equivalent of
$150 a month for a family of six.
   Unemployment declined from 9 percent in 1987 to 8.5 percent last
year, but government figures show that one-third of the labor force
worked less than 40 hours a week.
   While most Filipinos struggle economically, there are widespread
rumors of official corruption. True or not, they create the
perception that a privileged few benefit from the new administration.
   Last year, Mrs. Aquino promised that at least one well-known
public figure would be charged with corruption. The promise remains
unfulfilled.
   Experts say a major factor holding down living standards is the
lack of an effective population control program, a sensitive issue
in a Roman Catholic country.
   The Asian Development Bank has warned that economic gains in the
Philippines ae threatened by ``a continuing rapid growth in the
labor force.''
   The population is growing at about 2.5 percent annually. That
means 750,000 new jobs must be created each year.
   In a study, the bank also faulted the administration for the slow
pace of land reform, aimed at redistributing property to 3 million
landless peasants.
   The year-old program has virtually ground to a halt because of
scandals in the Department of Agrarian Reform. After delaying for
weeks, Mrs. Aquino recently replaced her land reform secretary
because he authorized purchase of property at grossly inflated
prices.
   Public disaffection is also growing over a feared breakdown in
law and order in Manila after a spate of almost daily police
killings and spectacular bank robberies.
   Coupled with this is a growing feeling that with a backlog of
300,000 cases in the court system, Filipinos cannot rely on the
justice system to protect their rights.
   The government blames communist rebels for most of the police
killings. But last month, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos acknowledged
widespread criminality in military ranks.
   Manila newspapers, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, said
many of the bank robberies in Manila are carried out by 10 gangs of
soldiers and former soldiers, who are shielded from arrest by their
officers.
   Few blame Mrs. Aquino personally. But even supporters believe
that she must shake off her relaxed, detached style in the face of
intractable problems.
   ``The president must now scratch off her slow, gradualist,
evolutionary style,'' wrote her former spokesman, Teodoro Benigno.
``What is needed for her is to...dare the fates and move
decisively.''

   A fisherman who cast his line for a catch
he could sink his teeth into instead reeled in a fish that could
sink its teeth into him.
   The three-pound piranha Greg Dell'Aria caught at a stone quarry
near this southwest Ohio town later devoured every goldfish in a
bait shop tank where Dell'Aria had stored the fish.
   ``He's got teeth as big as your bottom ones,'' the 32-year-old
fisherman said last week.
   Dell'Aria said he and some friends were fishing for bass on June
26 when he caught the piranha in about three feet of water. ``It
blew my mind; I'll tell you that,'' he said.
   Dell'Aria put the piranha in a tank at a friend's bait shop to
keep it alive. But the friend's wife had a baby the next day, so the
bait shop was closed for three days.
   When Dell'Aria's wife finally picked up the fish four days later,
she was told that ``it ate all of his goldfish _ cleaned him out,''
Dell'Aria said.
   By then Doug Maloney, fish management supervisor for the state
Fish and Wildlife District 5 office in Xenia, confirmed that the
fish was indeed a piranha.
   ``They were really surprised,'' Dell'Aria said. ``Everybody was
saying piranhas don't get that big. But I guess if they get old
enough and people feed them enough, they do.''
   The fish and wildlife experts theorized that someone bought the
piranha in a pet store and released it into the stone quarry.
   The piranha lived for several days in a beverage cooler filled
with water before it died. Dell'Aria says he will have his catch
mounted.

   Wanted: family practitioner with a yen for
country living and the qualifications to deliver babies. Reward of
$10,000 offered for information leading to hiring.
   Teton Medical Center, borrowing a tactic long used by law
officers to locate fugitives, has promised a bounty of $10,000 to
anybody whose tip leads to the hiring of a doctor of medicine or
osteopathy with obstetrics qualifications to practice in this
northwest Montana town of 1,800 people.
   The hospital hopes the reward offer will encourage residents to
join the search and make the process of recruiting a physician to a
rural hospital less painful, administrator Roz Bushman said.
   ``It's very difficult to get a doctor into rural areas,'' she
said. Rural physicians have to work long hours, are on call around
the clock seven days a week and earn substantially less than their
urban counterparts, she said.
   Bushman said Teton Medical Center, which serves about 6,500
people in Teton County and the Augusta area, needs another family
practitioner to handle a growing obstetrics practice and to spell
the current family practitioner whenever he leaves town.
   The advertisement featuring the medical center's reward ran twice
in late June in Choteau's weekly newspaper. Bushman said she has
received a couple of responses that she is tracking.
   The idea of posting a reward was suggested by the corporate
office of Lutheran Health Systems, which leases the 14-bed hospital
and its adjoining nursing home, Bushman said.
   The corporate office got good responses from several other small
hospitals that offered rewards and hired doctors within 90 days,
Bushman said.

   Investigators of an early-morning house
fire that killed six unattended children suspect a candle used to
light the house may have caused the city's deadliest blaze in 26
years.
   The victims ranged from age 9 to 14, said Capt. Mike Brown of the
Louisville Fire Department. No adults were home when the fire
started Tuesday, he said.
   The fire was accidental and started in a couch in a front room,
said Capt. Henry Ott, supervisor of the arson unit. It may have been
caused by a candle or a smoldering cigarette, he said.
   Electricity had been shut off because of overdue bills and
candles apparently were being used to light the house, Ott said.
   Chuck Randall, manager of district operations for Louisville Gas
&amp; Electric Co., said the electricity had been disconnected for an
undetermined amount of time.
   The deaths might have been prevented had batteries been in a
smoke detector found inside the home, Brown said.
   A smoke detector found on a mantle inside the home looked like
the type given out by the fire department, said Maj. Dayle Fortney,
chief investigator of the arson bureau.
   Batteries in another smoke detector weren't working, said fire
Maj. Donald Cummins.
   ``We provided a smoke detector at that residence in 1985 ... and
also checked an existing detector,'' Brown said.
   Assistant Jefferson County Coroner Sue Wurst identified the
victims as Shantee Watkins, 14; his cousin, Angie Watkins, 9; her
brother, Dion Watkins, 9; Latrice Gaither, 10; her brother, Don Juan
Gaither, 12; and a cousin of the Gaithers, Ginger Anderson, 10.
   Autopsies showed all died of smoke inhalation, Wurst said.
   Four of the children were found in separate bedrooms and the two
10-year-olds were found in the kitchen near the back door, which was
locked with a deadbolt that could be opened only with a key,
officials said.
   ``It's hard to say if they tried to get out,'' Brown said.
   The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m. The two-story frame house was
engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived and nothing could be
done to save the children, Brown said.
   An uncle of three of the children tried to get inside the house
and was jailed after scuffling with a police officer who tried to
restrain him.
   A woman, apparently a parent who lived at the home, arrived
shortly after the fire began. ``She was in shock, running up and
down the street screaming,'' Fortney said.
   A neighbor, Teresa Smith, 31, said the mother rarely left her two
children alone at the home. The four other children were cousins who
visited frequently, she said.
   ``They were a close family,'' Mrs. Smith said.
   Col. Jesse Spratt of the fire department said it was the city's
deadliest fire since 1963, when seven children were killed at a home
just a few blocks from the site of Tuesday's blaze.

<HEAD>Military Junta Orders Unilateral Cease-Fire in South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a second peace overture since seizing
power last week, the military junta led by Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
Ahmed el-Bashir has decreed a one-month unilateral cease-fire in the
war with southern rebels.
   The junta Tuesday night proposed a general amnesty for all
Sudanese who have taken up arms against the government since May
1983, when the rebellion led by turncoat army Col. John Garang began
in three southern provinces.
   The proposed amnesty in effect would cover the 50,000-60,000
rebels of Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The junta's actions stretched the cessation of hostilities in the
southern regions of Upper Nile, Bahr el-Ghazal and Equatoria into a
third month.
   Both sides stilled their guns in May and June in response to a
unilateral cease-fire proposed by Garang to allow the United Nations
to move 120,000 tons of relief supplies to the south to ward off
famine this summer.
   The new unilateral cease-fire, which took effect Tuesday, and the
proposed amnesty were announced in separate statements from the
Command Council of the National Salvation Revolution.
   The 15-member council overthrew the civilian government of Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi Friday in an apparently bloodless coup.
   The council said el-Mahdi's failure to end the civil war was
among principal reasons for the coup. It pledged to make peace in
the south its top priority, saying it would scrap all efforts begun
by el-Mahdi and make a fresh start.
   El-Bashir's subsequent actions appeared to bear this out. In a
Saudi newspaper interview published Monday, said he had invited
rebel leader Garang to come to Khartoum for peace talks.
   ``Inviting Garang to Khartoum is an initiative meant to
demonstrate good intent,'' el-Bashir, 45, told the newspaper Okaz.
   Tuesday night's announcement ordered ``a one-month truce in all
war zones and fighting scenes'' beginning immediately.
   Despite el-Bashir's repeated peace vows, spokesmen for the Sudan
People's Liberation Army have refrained from comment, saying it was
closely watching developments in Khartoum.
   The armed forces' official newspaper reported today that
el-Bashir told the Ethiopian ambassador that he wanted to send a
delegation to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, to meet with Garang's
representatives.
   Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha said the rebel command replied Tuesday night
that they were ready to talk with representatives of the junta. The
newspaper said no date was set for the delegation to go.
   The rebels have their political headquarters in Addis Ababa;
Ethiopia has backed the rebels with money, arms and training
facilities since they began their armed insurrection demanding
greater autonomy and a better economic deal for southerners.
   After lengthy hesitation, el-Mahdi's government, which took
office in 1986, opened peace talks with the rebels in Addis Ababa in
May. A new round was to have begun Tuesday, also in the Ethiopian
capital.
   It junta said it expected the general amnesty would be enacted
soon. This should not take long because el-Bashir's council has
dissolved parliament.
   Besides chairing the council, el-Bashir made himself premier,
defense minister and military commander-in-chief. He has promised to
form a Cabinet of civilians under the junta's tutelage.
   The junta also announced Tuesday that 15 southern politicians who
worked for el-Mahdi's government were arrested on charges of
corruption.
   This brought to 45 the number of political figures the military
said they have arrested since the coup. The detainees include
leaders of political parties, which have since been disbanded, but
not el-Mahdi.
   The Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram quoted el-Bashir as saying in an
interview that the prime minister, who led the Umma Party, remains
at large.
   He said el-Mahdi had attended the wedding of a relative in a
Khartoum suburb Thursday night and was not at home when troops
arrived after midnight to detain him.
   El-Bashir also told Al-Ahram he used just 300 soldiers and 10
tanks to seize power. He said the guard force at general
headquarters and many other military units immediately pledged
loyalty to his movement and that most political party militias had
surrendered to the army.

<HEAD>Seattle Man Fatally Shot Aboard Amtrak Train</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE WALES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Seattle man was fatally shot on an
Amtrak train and grieving relatives are questioning security
measures that would allow a man to board with a handgun.
   Ward Boole, 64, was shot while in a vestibule between passenger
and crew cars of the Amtrak Silver Star, said Polk County Sheriff's
Sgt. Roy McGuirt.
   ``He got on that thing thinking he was safe,'' said the victim's
brother, Bill Boole. ``The man served in three wars and never got
wounded. Then he goes up to a person like that and gets shot for no
reason. That is the tragedy of this country.''
   Boole said the federal government should require everybody who
boards public transportation to be searched for guns.
   Claude Paige, 69, of Fort Lauderdale, gave his .32-caliber
revolver to an Amtrak employee immediately after the shooting Monday.
   Paige was charged with second-degree murder, McGuirt said,
because there was no evidence the killing was planned.
   Passenger John Nelson said he, Paige and Boole met one another
for the first time on the train and were drinking in the train's
lounge just before the shooting.
   Nelson said Paige was talking to himself and had a revolver
tucked in his right front pants pocket just before the shooting.
After noticing the gun, Nelson said, he left Boole and Paige and
returned to his seat.
   Moments later, Nelson said, Boole left the lounge and walked into
the vestibule, with Paige following. Nelson said he heard a gunshot
and saw Boole fall to the floor.
   It may have been the first passenger murder on the federally
subsidized rail system, said Pat Duricka, an Amtrak spokeswoman in
Washington, D.C.
   ``No one can recall something like this happening,'' she said.
   Paige was held in the Polk County jail in lieu of $15,000 bail,
McGuirt said.
   The Silver Star, which originated in Miami and carried 241
passengers, was stopped immediately after the shooting just west of
Lake Wales and held for 2{ hours.
   Boole had visited relatives in Florida and was en route to see
some of his grandchildren in South Carolina. He died early Tuesday
at Winter Haven Hospital from the blast to his right eye, officials
said.

   The U.S. dollar recovered somewhat in European
dealings early today after plunging earlier amid profit-taking in
Asian markets. Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said the dollar dropped in Asian trading as dealers
continued to take profits in dollar-yen trading, but buying interest
in the European markets was limited and the dollar regained ground
despite speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower
interest rates as soon as Thursday.
   Dealers said activity was moderately active after Tuesday's light
trading during the Fourth of July holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.75 Japanese yen to a closing 140.20 yen. Later, in
London, it eased further to 140.05 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.9110 West German marks, down from 1.9220
   _1.6395 Swiss francs, down from 1.6527
   _6.4845 French francs, down from 6.5375

   In London, the British pound rose to $1.60, up from $1.5870 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $379.40 a troy ounce, up from $376.50
bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.40.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $378.75, up from $376.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.02 to close at $379.33.

<HEAD>Gluttonous Grouper Celebrates Truly Independent Fourth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A greedy grouper whose seemingly
insatiable appetite for his expensive tankmates made him famous
celebrated Independence Day by swimming free in his new home _ the
ocean.
   Eighteen months ago, a foot-long, 3-pound brown-spotted jewfish _
a member of the grouper family _ was plucked from the waters off the
Florida Keys. Terry Haley, owner of an aquarium store in Lansing,
Ill., bought it and took it north.
   He fed the fish five pounds of smelt every other day. But
evidently that wasn't enough for Flazey _ the fish's name, short for
fat and lazy.
   Between meals, he snacked on $5,000 worth of exotic fish that
shared his aquarium. That took six months. Flazey even tried to
consume a two-foot shark.
   The fish grew to 3{ feet and 35 pounds. Haley grew tired of
replacing costly tropical fish.
   So Flazey was returned to the ocean Monday, released from a thick
yellow net off Fort Lauderdale. Haley had flown the fish south
several days before.
   Wearing scuba gear, the store owner accompanied his famous charge
into the waves, and patted him one last time. Flazey then drifted
away.
   ``It was nice of him to hang around for a while,'' Haley said.
   Newspaper and television photographers captured the poignant
parting from a nearby Florida Marine Patrol boat.
   Haley said it was hard to watch Flazey disappear into the
darkness.
   ``I feel kind of bad, to tell you the truth,'' he said. ``It's
hard to explain. Even though it's a fish, it's like any other pet
you care for.''
   Flazey traveled to the site in a 50-gallon tank aboard a 24-foot
boat owned by Noyes Marine Life, the Fort Lauderdale aquarium
supplier that caught the fish and sold it to Haley.
   The store owner said he got phone calls from folks who didn't
want to see Flazey released, fearing he might be caught by an
angler. But Haley decided to return the grouper to his natural home.
   ``If we had never taken him out of the ocean, he would have had
just as equal a chance for survival,'' Haley said. ``He'll do fine.''
   Shortly after letting Flazey go, Haley seemed a bit wistful as he
thought of his former pet.
   ``It'd be great to know where he is right now,'' he said. ``He's
probably looking at the menu.''

   Abortion-rights activists clashed with police in Boston and
burned a flag-draped effigy of a justice in Atlanta during
demonstrations against the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing
states to restrict abortion.
   Pro-choice protesters who burned an American flag in Minneapolis
were attacked by three waiters from a topless bar. One man was
arrested and several protesters suffered bruises and abrasions,
police said.
   On a day when Americans celebrated their liberty, thousands of
people in at least 10 cities heard July Fourth calls to safeguard
abortion rights.
   Counterdemonstrations were held in three cities, but the
anti-abortionists were vastly outnumbered. The rallies came a day
after the high court upheld a Missouri law imposing restrictions on
abortion, inviting other states to do the same.
   ``The most fundamental liberty is the right to control our own
bodies,'' Massachusetts Rep. Susan D. Schur told more than 3,000
people at a rally in front of the Statehouse in Boston. ``For if we
have not the ability to control our own bodies, we are no more than
slaves.''
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy also denounced the ruling, and abortion
rights groups announced a statewide campaign to vote anti-abortion
lawmakers out of office in the 1990 elections.
   ``Vote with your heart, your head and your stomach,'' Schur said.
``Vote as if your life depends on it.''
   Protesters waved American flags, held signs with slogans
including ``My rights have been raped,'' and chanted ``Just Say
No!'' to the Supreme Court decision.
   Demonstrators scuffled with police trying to clear the crowd and
two people were arrested, including one on charges of assaulting an
officer, police said. Police also blocked about 300 protesters who
tried to broadcast their message to tens of thousands of people
gathered for the annual Boston Pops concert and fireworks display
along the Charles River.
   In Seattle, Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., told hundreds at a
pro-choice rally he was outraged by Monday's ruling: ``On the eve of
the Fourth of July, we witnessed an attack on a basic constitutional
right, the right of privacy.''
   Up to three dozen anti-abortion protesters also showed up. One
carried a 10-foot-tall sign of Jesus weeping over a fetus until a
pro-choice demonstrator knocked the sign down and another burned an
American flag on a coat hanger and threw it at him.
   Colorado Rep. Ruth Wright told a crowd of about 350 people at a
Boulder rally they faced a hard fight to maintain abortion rights.
``It's going to be tough; it's going to be ugly. We're going to be
accused of being baby killers. We're going to have to stand up to
that.''
   In Indianapolis, speakers told about 350 demonstrators to fight
backers of anti-abortion legislation expected in the 1990 General
Assembly as a result of the Supreme Court decision.
   ``You take our rights, you lose your jobs,'' said Melinda Rider,
executive director of the Indiana Pro-Choice Action League.
   More than 200 demonstrators outside the Maryland State House in
Annapolis also were urged to begin lobbying for the 1990 state
elections to preserve abortion rights. A few anti-abortion activists
approached the rostrum and interrupted the rally briefly before
police escorted them away.
   In Atlanta, about 450 abortion-rights advocates marched to the
Capitol, where protesters placed a handful of coat hangers on the
statue of former Gov. Eugene Talmadge.
   As the rally was ending, a small group of marchers set afire an
effigy of a Supreme Court justice wrapped in a flag. An unidentified
man tried to stop the flag-burning, shouting ``This is Nazism,'' but
was pushed back.
   The flag-burning in Minneapolis occurred as about 150 abortion
rights demonstrators rallied outside the federal building.
   When a small group of protesters began burning a flag, three
waiters from the Solid Gold nightclub ran across the street and
attacked them, said police watch commander Ed Scott. One of the
waiters was arrested for disorderly conduct.
   In Pittsburgh, an estimated 400 abortion rights advocates in
front of the federal building were challenged by half as many
anti-abortion demonstrators who gathered across the street singing
``God Bless America.''
   ``Let the babies live!'' the Rev. Keith Tucci, an Operation
Rescue leader, yelled through a bullhorn.
   There were no arrests or altercations, although each side tried
at times to out-shout the other and police had to keep anti-abortion
protesters from mixing with their opponents.
   Among the youngest pickets was 3-year-old Jennette Maddock, who
held a sign that read, ``Mommy had a choice _ why can't I?''
   Her father, John Maddock, said he and his wife, Janine, attended
the rally because ``this is a family thing with us.''
   ``Jennette was our choice,'' Mrs. Maddock said. ``It was a
serious decision, emotionally and financially. We think it's
important for people to come out and express their opinion.''
   About 200 demonstrators in downtown Milwaukee listened as Daniel
Maguire, a theologian and professor at Marquette University, told
them: ``You are the moral majority. Don't believe that they
represent the high moral ground.''
   A rally also was held in Madison, Wis.

<HEAD>For First Time in 60 Years, PRI Party Loses Governor's Race</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with PRI history, presidential spokeswoman's
quotes. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in its 60 years, the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party has accepted defeat in a
gubernatorial race.
   Luis Donaldo Colosio, president of the party's national executive
committee, said results compiled by the party showed the
conservative National Action Party (PAN) candidate had won Sunday's
race in Baja California state.
   Since its founding in 1929, the party known by its Spanish
initials as PRI has never lost a presidential election, so
dominating Mexican politics that its name became synonymous with
government.
   Only a year ago did the party suffer its first Senate losses, in
Michoacan state and the Mexico City federal district.
   Sunday's elections in five states were seen as a major test of
whether after seven months in office, President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari would make good on his promise to recognize opposition
victories and clean up the electoral process.
   A presidential spokeswoman said Salinas passed the test.
   ``The president made the decision to plunge into the democratic
game,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is an
unprecedented change in the history of Mexico.
   ``It marks the beginning of a new step in the political life of
the country. ... This opens new channels for political competition
in Mexico and living together in a multiparty system.''
   Official vote results are to be released Sunday, but Colosio's
statement was considered de facto recognition of the PRI loss in
Baja California.
   Salinas, the presidential spokeswoman said, ``is the first
president in the contemporary era of Mexico who has the courage and
the ability to recognize a defeat of his own party at the state
level.''
   Jesus Antonio Rivera, president of PAN's state committee in Baja
California, said he received the news of the victory with ``total
joy.''
   The victorious Ernesto Ruffo, a former mayor of Ensenada, and the
PRI's Margarita Ortega had each claimed victory in the gubernatorial
race.
   Opposition parties had said that if the PRI claim of victory were
backed by the electoral commission, they would consider the election
stolen.
   The PRI in recent years has been increasingly criticized for
alleged widespread vote-manipulation, rigging of elections and
repeated balloting irregularities.
   The party had in the past maintained its strength through a
network of labor unions and organizations of farm workers,
government employees and other groups that turned out the vote in
exchange for jobs, political posts, access to funds and other perks.
   Elections last July showed PRI's power was fading.
   United behind a single candidate for the first time, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the left held Salinas to 50 percent of the vote. The PRI
held onto its congressional majority, but lost the two-thirds needed
to rubber stamp constitutional reforms.
   The electoral commission, independent voting observers and PAN
all agreed there were numerous irregularities in Sunday's voting,
such as the theft of ballot boxes, obstruction of opposition
observers and the early closing of some polling places.
   Two of the other states holding elections _ Zacatecas and
Campeche _ are traditional PRI strongholds, but in Michoacan the
leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party led by Cardenas was claiming
victory.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party claimed it had won at least 14
of Michoacan's 24 seats in the state assembly.
   In Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, throngs
of disgruntled PAN members staged a 90-minute demonstration Monday
night at the local election board to protest massive irregularities
in the Chihuahua state elections for mayors.
   PAN spokesman Gustavo Elizondo and other party leaders said
dozens of voters reported having their thumbs stamped with
presumably indelible ink that could be washed off, allowing them to
vote more than once.

<HEAD>Fun _ And Fireworks _ At Gotti's Party, Despite Police Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police ban on fireworks at the annual Fourth of
July block party thrown by reputed mobster John Gotti failed to
dampen the spirits of thousands of revelers _ or keep the nighttime
skies dark.
   Gotti has thrown an Independence Day bash for some 20 years at
the site of his hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club, and ended
the party with a blaze of pyrotechnics.
   A warning from the local police precinct failed to stop the show
last year, and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward vowed his
department wouldn't be embarrassed again.
   But Tuesday night, the presence of scores of police failed to
stop men on rooftops from sending off rockets to the cheers of
crowds on the streets. Shortly before, taunts of ``Pigs go home''
and ``We want the works'' were heard.
   Police, who had told the party's organizers fireworks would be
illegal without a permit, said the rocket-throwers apparently were
mavericks. They issued one summons for possession of illegal
fireworks but made no arrests.
   Officers lined barricades on each side of the block and closed
off streets for four blocks in every direction, except to cars
driven by local residents.
   ``Gotti! Gotti! Gotti!'' the crowd cheered as their host, the
48-year-old reputed head of the Gambino crime family, emerged
briefly from the club that authorities call his headquarters.
   Gotti is under indictment in the attempted murder of a union
leader. But grateful locals had no trouble downing his hamburgers,
grilled under the supervision of two of the host's brothers.
   ``He's got a good heart,'' said Sal Ceffali, who attended with
his wife and two grandsons. ``He takes care of people in the
community,'' added his wife, Sally. ``You're not afraid to walk
around at night.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Shibley, a defense attorney who
represented Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, and helped
defend 12 Hispanics in the ``Zoot Suit'' murder case of the 1940s,
has died of cardiac arrest at 79.
   Shibley died Tuesday at Good Samaritan Hospital, where he had
undergone heart surgery June 8.
   He was a supporter of Kennedy's presidential campaign when the
senator was shot to death in 1968 in Los Angeles hours after winning
the California Democratic primary.
   But he took on Sirhan's case after Mary Sirhan appealed for help
when her son was sentenced to death.
   Sirhan's sentence was reduced to life in prison when the
California Supreme Court, ruling in an unrelated case, said the
state Constitution prohibited the death penalty. The state has since
restored capital punishment.
   In the 1940s the lawyer, who had graduated from Stanford
University only a few years before, helped defend 12 young Hispanics
in the murder of a Mexican immigrant in what came to be known as the
``Zoot Suit'' case because of the long, baggy suits worn in the
barrio. The case became the basis of a movie and play.
   Newspapers of the era fanned prejudice against the defendants,
who were convicted despite the efforts of seven defense attorneys.
But Shibley, who had filed a rash of objections during the trial,
successfully appealed.
   ``Depending on how you look at it, the case made me famous or
infamous,'' Shibley recalled in 1986. ``It also made the forces of
law and order hate me.''

   Police talked a depressed deaf-mute man down from
the rooftop ledge of a 32-story building with help from two sisters
who know sign language.
   Police were called to the building in upper Manhattan on Tuesday.
Tina and Brenda Pedraza, who live in the neighborhood and heard of
the problem, offered to help.
   Officers Henry Medina and Ray Ruiz told Tina Pedraza, 31, what
they wanted to say. In sign language, she passed it on to Brenda
Pedraza, 22, who signed it to Victor Bruno, 24.
   ``We told him that we had experienced suicide in our family,''
said Tina Pedraza, ``and that he was young and had a life to live.''
   Bruno said he was depressed and wanted to visit his sister in
Michigan, Medina said.
   The officers told Bruno they had a plane ticket to Detroit for
him and threw a watch onto the ledge to show him the flight would
leave soon. When Bruno went to pick up the watch, the officers
grabbed him.
   He was taken to Harlem Hospital for observation, police said.

   Dogs and cats yelped and scratched
firefighters trying to carry them to safety as a fire raced through
a packed kennel, killing nearly three dozen animals, officials said
today.
   Firefighters saved 35 pets in Tuesday's blaze at the Townhouse
for Dogs, which was filled for the long holiday weekend, said Fire
Battalion Chief Joe Milligan. Thirty-five pets were killed and 16
others were missing.
   At least 10 of the rescued animals were treated by veterinarians
for shock and smoke inhalation, Milligan said.
   The fire broke out in a storage building owned by the Hychem Co.
and spread to the adjacent kennel, burning for about two hours and
causing an estimated $1.2 million in damage, Milligan said.
   Pet owners waited anxiously outside the building as an occasional
dog bolted out, chased by firefighters.
   Barbara Christiansen of La Canada scanned the gutted shelter
entrance. ``I have a Scottie named Brindy. I've been taking her here
for years,'' she said. ``I'm sure she would get out if she could.''
   Christiansen wept when she learned the dog had died.
   ``Initially, we could hear the dogs yelling and screaming,'' said
fire Capt. John Higby, whose hands were covered with scratches from
a cat he saved. ``We could barely see anything.''
   The storage building, which contained cleaning chemicals, was
destroyed, but the fire was confined to the rear of the kennel, the
chief said.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation.
   One firefighter was treated after receiving an electric shock.
Another suffered heat exhaustion.

   Belgium, the Netherlands and West
Germany today criticized Moscow for failing to inform them that a
pilotless MiG-23 jet was flying over their territory. The jet
crashed in Belgium, killing one person.
   The three NATO nations lodged stern protests, asking their Soviet
ambassadors why they had to wait for 10 hours Tuesday to get a
reaction to the MiG-23 crash through the official news agency Tass.
   Wreckage of the Soviet plane, meanwhile, was being removed from
the crash site on the French-Belgian border, 55 miles west of
Brussels. Officials said remains will be returned to the Soviet
Union.
   ``There was an extreme slowness in information,'' Foreign
Minister Mark Eyskens told reporters after he summoned Felix
Bogdanov, the Soviet ambassador.
   ``In the age of glasnost, transparency and information without
reserve,'' must be more quickly forthcoming, he added of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   In Bonn, foreign ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said his
government summoned a Soviet diplomat and expressed its annoyance
that ``nothing was done to inform governments involved about the
incident.''
   The Dutch foreign ministry asked ``the Soviet Union for
clarification on the incident ... and for measures that will prevent
any such incident in the future.''
   Eyskens called for improved East-West cooperation. ``My
conclusion, corroborated by the Soviet ambassador, is that
information systems have to be improved between the two blocs,'' he
said, adding Belgium will raise the issue with its allies in the
Western alliance.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov had no explanation why
Warsaw Pact defense forces failed to detect the runaway jet. ``It is
difficult to say why it was not shot down, why it was not
detected,'' Yazov said in Moscow.
   ``A large-scale investigation should be carried out,'' he said.
Investigators were on their way to Kolobrzeg airfield in Poland,
where the plane took off on a training flight.
   ``The afterburner spontaneously switched off during the takeoff
and the plane began to decelerate,'' Yazov said. ``Following the
bail-out, a sufficient thrust, in all probability, developed and the
plane continued its flight.''
   The errant combat plane flew for about an hour over densely
populated areas of West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium before
crashing into a house a few miles from a major urban sprawl, killing
one resident.
   ``The Warsaw Pact had over an hour to warn us,'' said Eyskens.
``They did not. It is regrettable.''
   NATO officials said two American jets intercepted the runaway MiG
over West Germany, but did not shoot it down because it was over a
densely populated area, Tass said.

   Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov had no explanation
today for why Warsaw Pact defense forces failed to detect and shoot
down a runaway MiG-23 jet fighter that crashed into a house in
Belgium, killing a man.
   Also today, West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium said the
Soviet Union should have notified them when the plane entered their
airspace.
   In an interview with Tass, Yazov said investigators were en route
to Kolobrzeg airfield in Poland to find out why the MiG's pilot
bailed out after takeoff on a training mission, leaving the jet to
fly pilotless for 560 miles.
   From Poland, the investigators will fly to the crash site and
discuss compensation for the death and damages with Belgian
officials, the official news agency said.
   ``It is difficult to say why it was not shot down, why it was not
detected,'' Yazov said. ``A large-scale investigation should be
carried out.''
   The defense minister said he believed an engine malfunction
immediately after takeoff on the training flight prompted the pilot
to eject.
   ``As the pilot himself explained, the afterburner spontaneously
switched off during the takeoff and the plane began to decelerate,''
Yazov said. ``Following the bail-out, a sufficient thrust, in all
probability, developed and the plane continued its flight.''
   The MiG-23 flew over some of Western Europe's most densely
populated regions and crashed just miles from a cluster of cities
along the French-Belgian border.
   Two American jets intercepted the runaway MiG over West Germany,
but did not shoot it down because it was over a densely populated
area, Tass said.
   The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany
lodged stern protests today demanding to know why Moscow gave no
information about the plane as it overflew their territories and why
they had to wait for 10 hours Tuesday to get a first reaction to the
crash through the official Tass news agency.
   ``There was an extreme slowness in information,'' Belgian Foreign
Minister Mark Eyskens told reporters after he summoned Soviet
Ambassador Felix Bogdanov.
   ``My conclusion, corroborated by the Soviet ambassador, is that
information systems have to be improved between the two blocs,'' he
said, adding Belgium will raise the issue with its NATO allies.
   A Soviet MiG-29 crashed June 8 at the prestigious Paris Air Show.
   A joint French-Soviet commission established that a bird sucked
into the engine caused the crash.
   The MiG-23 Flogger, a swing-wing single engine jet, first entered
service in 1967. It usually is armed with one 23-mm gun and can
carry anti-aircraft missiles.
   Variations on the basic design are flown by all Warsaw Pact
nations and have been sold to other countries.
   The Flogger, which has been superseded in some Soviet units by
more advanced fighters, can fly at Mach 2.35, or 1,551 mph at 30,000
fett above sea level, according to Jane's ``All the World's
Aircraft,'' published in London.

   Former President Reagan once said, ``There is
nothing so good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.''
   He may not feel that way today following his Fourth of July toss
from a horse at a ranch in Mexico that resulted in minor bruises and
abrasions.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the horse Reagan was riding
bucked on a rocky downhill slope, throwing the 78-year-old former
president to the ground.
   Weinberg said Reagan called the incident ```My own private
rodeo,''' adding that ``he's an excellent rider and he held on quite
a while.''
   Although Tuesday's ride may have been a rough one, Reagan has
generally found serenity on the back of a horse.
   ``That's how he charges his batteries,'' said former Reagan
spokesman Jim Lake in a 1980 newspaper interview. ``He doesn't go
out and drink or carouse or party or entertain, he likes to go up
there in the loneliness of his 677-acre ranch, riding his horses,
building his fences being with his wife. ... I think it's his sense
of personal accomplishment and achievement, his physical handling of
the world.''
   Aides have said that Reagan did much of his thinking about the
problems a president might face in the days prior to his successful
1980 campaign while riding a horse around his ranch 30 miles west of
Santa Barbara.
   Reagan took up riding when he was a young sportscaster in Des
Moines, Iowa in the 1930s, and pursued it enthusiastically right
through his presidency. He would often take off one afternoon a week
to go riding at the Marine base in Quantico, Va.
   As California governor, Reagan rode several times in the annual
trek of the Rancheros Vistadores, a 65-miles ride that was started
as a way for men who enjoy the atmosphere of the old West to get
away for a few days.
   In 1976, when he made his ill-fated presidential run, Reagan told
reporters his Secret Service guards were joining him on rides.
   ``I give them riding lessons,'' he said.
   During his eight years as president, Reagan on a horse was a
familiar sight, serving as a reminder to the nation that its elderly
president was in robust health.
   In September 1985, Reagan joked about taking his first horseback
ride since undergoing colon cancer surgery two months earlier.
   He told reporters, ``My horse and I had a chance to get
reacquainted and I had time to reflect once again on an old truth
from the cavalry _ there is nothing so good for the inside of a man
as the outside of a horse.''

   Afghan jet fighters bombed guerrilla
positions around Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad today, a
day after the government claimed the resistance was preparing a
major offensive.
   Also today, at least eight rockets slammed into Kabul, killing at
least five people, said an official of the Soviet-backed government.
   Two rockets hit a residential area 1,000 yards from the
Continental Hotel in northwestern Kabul, where most visiting
foreigners, including journalists, live. There were no immediate
reports of casualties near the hotel.
   Diplomatic sources and witnesses said the dawn air strikes on the
guerrilla positions near Kabul were the most intensive in weeks, but
there was no immediate report of casualties.
   The Supreme Defense Council, reporting the bombings around
Jalalabad, said its forces ``were combatting with high morale and
inflicting retaliatory blows'' to defend the city, which has been
under guerrilla siege since March 7.
   The statement gave no word on casualties.
   The government official, who demanded anonymity, said the air
force and artillery units battled the U.S.-backed guerrillas
Jalalabad.
   The city is 75 miles east of the capital and 45 miles west of the
border with Pakistan, where many of the guerrillas are based.
   The fighter-bombers were seen flying off from Kabul and nearby
Baghram air base in formations of two and three for the Paghman
Mountains northwest of the capital. The mountains serve as a
sanctuary for resistance fighters.
   Thirty to 35 planes took part in an operation that began at dawn
and continued for 90 minutes, witnesses said.
   Afghan government officials were not available for immediate
comment.
   Some of the aircraft headed for the eastern province of
Nangarhar, where the guerrillas launched their first major attacks
three weeks after the Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal
from Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   Jalalabad, scene of fierce battles between the resistance and
government troops, is the capital Nangarhar and the country's fifth
largest city.
   It is considered of strategic importance because of its proximity
to Pakistan, where the most powerful guerrilla groups are based.
   The government claims it broke the rebel siege on Jalalabad last
month, but official Kabul Radio has reported fighting around the
city for the past two weeks. The radio said guerrillas on Tuesday
fired artillery and rockets into residential areas of Jalalabad,
killing four people, including two children, and wounding eight,
including two soldiers.
   The government said Tuesday that Moslem rebels were planning
simultaneous ``massive attacks'' on Kabul and other major cities,
and asked the United Nations to intervene to stop the ``impending
bloodbath.''
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the guerrillas were planning to
launch the assault in mid-July.
   Wakil said the rebels were being aided in their planned attack by
U.S. and Pakistani army officers. He did not elaborate.
   ``The grave consequences (of the attack) which will include
bloodshed, killings and destruction, will be shouldered by the
Pakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack,'' Wakil
said in a statement Tuesday.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in an April 1978 coup. In December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened
to prop up the Marxist regime.
   Soviet troops left Afghanistan after a U.N.-mediated accord.

   A woman who blamed the deaths of her four
children on ``bad luck'' has been charged with murdering her eldest
daughter in 1982.
   Martha Ann Johnson, 34, was arrested Monday and jailed without
bail in the death of 11-year-old Jennyann Wright, Clayton County
police said.
   Jennyann's death was originally attributed to ``probable
asphyxia'' of undetermined cause.
   Death certificates said the girl's 2-year-old brother and
3-month-old sister died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1977 and
1980. A 2-year-old brother in 1981 died of a seizure disorder of
unknown causes.
   The case was reopened in December after inquiries by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
   Sgt. Ken Stewart said he has ``good information on two of the
four'' deaths but refused to discuss the information or say whether
other murder charges will be filed.
   Authorities said that before each death Mrs. Johnson's husband at
the time, Earl S. Bowen, had moved out. Mrs. Johnson ascribed the
deaths to ``bad luck.''

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk today ruled out a separate peace agreement with the
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh and promised to keep
fighting.
   He told a news conference that Vietnam's promised September
withdrawal of its troops is a farce.
   And Sihanouk clung to his Khmer Rouge allies, saying any
settlement must include the communists who killed perhaps a million
of their countrymen while they were in power 1975-78.
   ``I tell you very clearly that I will not go to Phnom Penh,''
Sihanouk said at his mansion in Beijing, one of several
homes-in-exile.
   ``I refuse to cooperate with Hun Sen on a bilateral basis,'' he
said of Cambodia's prime minister.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge,
has said it will pull the last of its troops out in September.
However, Sihanouk claimed that 130,000 Vietnamese soldiers will
remain disguised as Cambodian soldiers and peasant militia.
   He insisted that no settlement can be reached until all
Vietnamese have left, including 1 million Vietnamese civilian
settlers, and until Hun Sen agrees to a coalition including the
Khmer Rouge.
   ``The problem will not be solved after the 30th of September,''
Sihanouk said.
   ``No one can stop the resistance from fighting. It is not because
we don't have compassion for our people,'' he said. ``We are not for
war. We are fighting for peace. But peace without independence is
meaningless.''
   In talks in May, Hun Sen had proposed changes to make the
Cambodian Constitution more acceptable to the prince and suggested
that Sihanouk return to Phnom Penh as head of state after the
Vietnamese withdrawal.
   Hun Sen has refused to accept Khmer Rouge participation in a
post-Vietnamese coalition government including Sihanouk and a third
resistance group led by non-communist Son Sann.
   Sihanouk, who was held under house arrest when the Khmer Rouge
were in power, appeared in May to flirt with the idea of dropping
his communist allies. However, he said today such a move would put
``the oxen before the cart.''
   ``We must concentrate on fighting the Vietnamese,'' he said. He
said critics focus on Khmer Rouge atrocities but ignore Amnesty
International reports alleging torture and murder by Hun Sen's
government.
   Sihanouk is under international pressure, including from
Southeast Asian nations that support him, to reach an agreement
before the Vietnamese withdraw, but he said he is not optimistic.
   The prince rejected Hun Sen's proposed constitutional amendments
as ``cosmetic,'' saying they would leave the government ``very
Vietnamese-style communist.''
   He said the resistance is preparing its own draft to present at
July 24 peace talks in Paris. It will provide for a ``liberal
parliamentary democracy'' modeled on France, with a president chosen
by direct popular election for a seven-year term.

   Black inmates wielding broom handles and

packed to five times its capacity, officials said. Fifteen inmates
were reported injured.
   The disturbance, which occurred Tuesday in a recreation area at
the El Cajon Detention Facility, continued sporadically for about 20
minutes before it was stopped by guards, sheriff's Sgt. Frank
Ramirez said.
   Fifteen black inmates started the melee in a sector designed for
24 inmates but holding 112, Ramirez said.
   Fifteen inmates were taken to the hospital with injuries
including concussions, a broken nose, cuts and bruises, officials
said. ``None of the injuries were life threatening, and there were
no injuries to the jail staff,'' Ramirez said.
   A series of disturbances in the San Diego County jails over the
past few months have been attributed to overcrowding, racial tension
and a no-smoking policy that took effect over the weekend.

   President Bush returned to the White House
today to work on pre-summit briefings following five exercise-filled
days that his wife said were not exactly restful, ``but a lot of
fun.''
   From his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, on Tuesday, Bush
placed a call to former President Reagan, who was slightly scraped
and bruised when thrown from a horse in Mexico earlier in the day.
   First lady Barbara Bush told reporters today that the president
could not reach Reagan directly by telephone, but sent best wishes
to him through security personnel and Reagan messaged him back.
   Mrs. Bush also disclosed that the five-day Fourth of July
vacation at last produced a successful presidential fishing
excursion.
   After four days with nary a bite, Bush caught five bluefish on
Tuesday, she said, holding her hands about 18 inches apart to
indicate their size.
   The president, who spent his vacation in an almost non-stop whirl
of tennis, golf, running, boating and swimming, hosted 70 people for
dinner one night, including extended family and local friends, the
first lady said.
   She joked that she was going home to rest after the hectic
vacation.
   ``Three grandchildren, two dogs and 500 relatives is not rest,''
Mrs. Bush told reporters flying home with the president. ``But a lot
of fun,'' she added.
   The White House doctor traveling with the president, Dr. Lawrence
Mohr, said Bush's frenetic pace was typical.
   ``I never saw him tired the whole weekend,'' Mohr said, although
Bush himself admitted to reporters he was tired at the end of one
day that had begun with a 6:30 a.m. jog and included boating,
tennis, swimming, golf, fishing and church services.
   Mrs. Bush brushed aside a question on her own feelings regarding
the Supreme Court decision Monday giving the states power to
regulate and restrict abortions.
   ``I go with my president,'' she said. Bush applauded the court
decision as a good step.
   Bush had no public schedule today but was planning to meet with
top advisers for briefings on the upcoming economic summit in Paris.
   He leaves Sunday for Poland, where his call this week for
withdrawal of Soviet troops was apparently designed to have public
appeal.
   Bush looked ahead to his East European trip in an interview with
Polish journalists that was released by his staff on Monday.
   In the interview, Bush urged the Soviet Union to take ``an
historic opportunity to help end the postwar division in Europe.''
   He proposed for the first time that the Soviets remove their
troops from Poland.
   Bush told the Polish reporters that in their homeland, ``there's
an historic opportunity now to help end the postwar division of
Europe.''
   Bush has promised economic incentives for Poland in response for
its recent steps toward democracy. However, he has released no
specific figures or proposals.
   His trip comes just a few days after Poland saw its Solidarity
union become the first independent opposition to enter an East bloc
legislature since the late 1940s.
   After Poland, Bush travels to Hungary, France and the Netherlands.

   Secretary of State James A.
Baker III today arrived for talks on achieving peace in Cambodia
once Vietnam completes the scheduled withdrawal of its forces in
September.
   Baker and his colleagues from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations are anxious to avoid an outbreak of civil war among four
contending factions in Cambodia after the Vietnamese are gone.
   Baker arrived in this tiny sultanate after a one-day visit to
Japan. He plans meetings with his colleagues from ASEAN's six member
states _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
   The association concluded its annual meeting Tuesday and is
comparing notes with the United States and other outside parties in
talks Thursday through Saturday.
   An ASEAN communique issued Tuesday night called for a
comprehensive settlement to the Cambodian conflict. To achieve that
goal, France has suggested a meeting among the contending factions
later this month in Paris.
   The Southeast Asian group has been active in bringing the various
Cambodian factions together for settlement talks, but it is far from
certain that goal can be achieved.
   In Beijing, Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
today ruled out a separate peace agreement with the
Vietnamese-installed government led by Hun Sen and pledged to keep
on fighting with his Khmer Rouge allies. Hun Sen suggested that
Sihanouk return as head of state after Vietnam withdraws but
rejected Khmer Rouge participation in a new government.
   Baker and the ASEAN countries say an effort must be made to
prevent a return to power of the Khmer Rouge, whose bloody 3{-year
rule in the 1970's claimed the lives of 1 million Cambodians. The
Khmer Rouge were ousted by Vietnamese invading forces a decade ago.
   A reported Bush administration plan to provide lethal aid to
non-communist forces in Cambodia has touched off heated debate in
Congress. These forces have been receiving non-lethal U.S. aid since
1985.
   Defending the proposal for lethal aid, Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian Affairs, says
the Khmer Rouge could take power once again and turn Cambodia into
an ``Asian Auschwitz.''
   But Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., have proposed
legislation to ban U.S. military aid to the non-communist factions.
   All representatives at the conference want a political settlement
in Cambodia before the Vietnamese forces pull out.
   China could play a key role in determining the outcome in
Cambodia because it is the major supplier of aid to the Khmer Rouge.
   China had been distancing itself from the Khmer Rouge, but U.S.
officials aboard Baker's plane said China's willingness to cooperate
with the ASEAN-led effort in Cambodia is less certain following the
political victory last month of hard-liners in Beijing over more
moderate forces.
   China was one of the topics of discussion between Baker and
Japanese Prime Minster Sosuke Uno in Tokyo. The two countries appear
to have much the same view of the Chinese situation.
   Both have loosened their ties with the Beijing government since
the June 3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, but neither
plans any additional measures for the time being, according to an
official traveling with Baker.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Baker and Uno agreed
that despite the ``outrage'' committed by Chinese authorities, it
would be a mistake to try to isolate China from the outside world.

   China today announced a crackdown on corrupt local
officials and said it has solved the capital's biggest fraud case.
   The moves were the government's latest attempt to deal with some
of the complaints that fueled the pro-democracy movement.
   The government also promised leniency toward Chinese students who
held protests in the United States to condemn the crackdown on the
movement.
   Also today, the State Tourism Bureau ordered major hotels in
Beijing that receive Cable News Network and the American Forces
Radio and Television Service to shut down reception of the
broadcasts, hotel officials said.
   Tourism officials were not immediately available for comment, and
the city Foreign Affairs Office said it did not know of any such
order.
   In another development, Chinese soldiers confiscated film from
Japanese tourists affiliated with the Japan Socialist Party after
they took pictures from buses of Tiananmen Square, an action
forbidden under martial law.
   The soldiers boarded three of the four buses and asked people who
took pictures of the square to hand over their film, said Hideo
Tarumi of the Japanese Embassy's consular section. Less than 10
people complied, said Tarumi, who added that the embassy considered
the incident over and ``not a big deal.''
   Official Chinese media today reported arrests, confessions and
trials of officials who defrauded their work units and took bribes.
   The stories drove home the theme that the ruling Communist Party
is involved in a major effort to root out corruption.
   Rampant official corruption has been a focus of popular anger.
Calls to eliminate it were common among pro-democracy protesters
whose seven-week movement was crushed June 4 when troops drove them
from Tiananmen Square.
   Chinese media said nearly 100 soldiers and police died in the
crackdown and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians
died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as
3,000.
   A wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists followed the
crackdown, along with the suppression of the free exchange of ideas.
   The corruption cases reported today included what the Communist
Party newspaper People's Daily called the biggest fraud case in the
Chinese capital since the founding of communist China 40 years ago.
   The paper announced the trial of six people charged with
defrauding the Chinese Academy of Sciences Microelectronics Center
out of $105,000. The paper did not indicate when the trial began or
whether a verdict was reached.
   Communist Party chiefs in Henan province and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region announced anti-corruption steps Monday ``as part
of an effort to respond to the central government's call on
construction of an honest and clean government organ to win the
trust of the people,'' a Xinhua report said.
   In Henan, government-run companies will be screened by the end of
August and anyone engaging in profiteering or blackmail will be
sternly punished, Xinhua said. Inner Mongolian officials who have
taken advantage of their positions were urged to turn themselves in
and return ill-gotten money and goods, the report said.
   At a trial in Shanghai, seven people, including four Communist
Party members, were charged with cheating the city government's
Textile Industry Bureau out of $35,000, the Legal Daily said.
   Led by Liu Zhen, deputy director of the bureau, they charged
inflated prices for equipment, concocted bogus expenses and dodged
taxes, the paper said. It did not give any results of the trial,
which began June 20.
   Officials in Wuhan, Hubei province, reported that 13 people have
turned themselves in since Jan. 1, including the party secretary of
a marine transportation enterprise who confessed in May to accepting
bribes of $3,500, the Worker's Daily said.
   Wuhan prosecution authorities ``are using various channels to
promote awareness of laws and consequences of corruption, including
rewarding informers and protecting them from revenge,'' the paper
said.
   Officials in Chengdu, Sichuan province, also reported
achievements in cracking down on corruption in the first half of
this year, the Worker's Daily said without elaborating.
   The government, meanwhile, said it would not investigate Chinese
students in the United States who participated in anti-Beijing
rallies ``without knowing the truth.''
   A statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Washington said
Beijing ``would take a lenient approach toward Chinese students who,
without knowing the truth, participated in the demonstrations ...
and that it will not look into their cases at all,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency.

   Hundreds of people filed past the flower-adorned
open casket of Andrei A. Gromyko today to bid farewell to the man
who steered Soviet diplomacy through the Cold War and detente.
   Diplomats and commoners lined the sidewalk for several blocks
under gray skies as they waited to enter the turquoise-colored
Central Soviet Army House in north Moscow.
   A black-and-white portrait of Gromyko, featuring the dour face
that earned him the nickname ``Grim Grom,'' hung at the entrance.
   Because Gromyko held no public office when he died, he received a
private funeral, but the official media gave accolades to the man
who served as foreign minister for 28 years and retired gracefully
from the presidency nine months ago when Mikhail S. Gorbachev eased
him out of power.
   Gromyko died Sunday at age 79.
   ``His name is connected with the huge successes of Soviet foreign
policy, directed at the relaxation of international tension and
consolidation of world peace,'' Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, premier of the
Russian federation, told 300 mourners at Novodevichy Cemetery before
Gromyko was buried.
   Vorotnikov, a member of the ruling Politburo, was the most senior
Soviet official at the 15-minute ceremony.
   Gorbachev and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who suceeded Gromyko as
foreign minister, were on an official visit to France.
   As a drizzle wet mourners, Gromyko was buried among the ornate
graves of the Soviet elite at Novodevichy, the most prestigious
Soviet resting place after Red Square. A military honor guard fired
a salute as workers shoveled soil over his red and black coffin.
   Gromyko's son, Anatoly _ who followed in his father's foreign
policy footsteps and heads a Kremlin think tank on African affairs _
shook his head solemnly as he held the hand of his veiled, weeping
mother, Lydia.
   Prominent Soviet writers, actors, cosmonauts and political and
military figures are buried in Novodevichy. Buried there are such
Soviet leaders as Nikita S. Khrushchev, Nikolai A. Bulganin and
Vyacheslav M. Molotov.
   As he lay in state earlier, Gromyko's body was surrounded by his
29 medals displayed on red cushions. Among the awards were Hero of
Socialist Labor and the country's highest civilian honor, the Order
of Lenin, which he received six times.
   The cause of Gromyko's death was not announced, but a Soviet
source said today he had been hospitalized for three weeks and died
when his aorta burst. He had been diagnosed as having circulatory
problems five years ago, the source said on condition of anonymity.
   Gromyko became foreign minister after serving as ambassador to
the United States during World War II, to the United Nations and to
Britain in a half-century of public service.
   He was a fixture in world diplomacy for decades, helping forge
the Alliance that won World War II, joining in founding the United
Nations and participating in superpower talks that shaped the modern
world.
   But when Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985, he eased Gromyko
out of the ruling elite, steering Kremlin foreign policy toward a
new, nonconfrontational approach.
   Some Soviets have said Gromyko shared the blame for foreign
policy mistakes, such as the 1979 Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan. The confrontational approach he represented was
reflected in another nickname, ``Mr. Nyet.''
   Those attending the funeral echoed the reserved respect expressed
by the Soviet leadership.
   ``He represented old times,'' said navy officer Andrei N.
Pochtarev. ``Now we must have a new approach. Times have changed.''
   Longtime Soviet ambassador to Washington Anatoly F. Dobrynin, now
an adviser to Gorbachev, told reporters as he arrived to pay his
respects, ``He was leading and working during a very difficult time
in our history. He has done his best.''

   Hyde and Regent's parks became temporary parking
lots today as rail and subway workers again staged 24-hour strikes
and London's bus services were disrupted by a one-day walkout by
maintenance crews.
   Army teams laid metal sheeting over the grass in the two parks to
provide 7,000 extra parking spaces to ease congestion as commuters
who normally take public transportation took to their vehicles.
   Another 1,000 park-and-ride spaces were made available on
London's outskirts, but police said: ``Only drive into London if you
must.''
   Investment manager Jeremy Soutter and three colleagues traveled
to work along the River Thames straddling a 13-foot-long inflatable
tube towed by a speedboat. Their suits got a bit wet, but Soutter
said they enjoyed the meandering, seven-mile ride.
   The Confederation of British Industry estimated nearly 75 percent
of London workers showed up today.
   Many commuters booked hotels and taxis. Some companies hired
buses.
   Harrods department store postponed its summer sale for fear the
strikes would prevent shoppers getting into central London.
   State-owned British Rail announced record profits of $486 million
today, but said most of the surplus was reinvested and not used for
pay rises.
   London has been beset by 24-hour strikes on its subway system for
three months. But today was only the second time that workers on the
three major transport networks struck at once.
   The rail strike was the third one-day nationwide stoppage in
three weeks.
   Union militancy in Britain is on the upsurge following a decade
of reverses as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government curbed union powers.
   On Tuesday, public services from slaughterhouses to libraries
operated by city halls were disrupted throughout Britain by a
one-day walkout over pay. The National Association of Local
Government Officers said 90 percent of its 500,000 members on city
payrolls stayed home.
   The 17-union Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions, meanwhile, has threatened strikes against selected companies
to demand a shorter working week and morepay for 2 million workers.
   Unions say 4,000 North Sea oil workers are involved in a dispute
over pay and safety measures, and dock workers have threatened a
national strike over government plans to abolish their long-standing
jobs-for-life guarantee.
   Strikes this year have regularly shut passport offices and
disrupted news and current affairs programs at the British
Broadcasting Corp.
   Referring to Wednesday's strikes, Mrs. Thatcher told the House of
Commons on Tuesday: ``I think the unions have given no thought to
the general public.''
   But Neil Kinnock, opposition Labor Party leader, accused
Conservatives of seeking to exploit public anger over the strikes
for their own political ends.
   Today's strike by 10,500 London subway employees was their ninth
in 13 weeks to demand extra pay for operating trains without a
guard. They want a $101 weekly increase while management has offered
$47 plus 14 days extra annual vacation, with the raise tied to
increased productivity.
   The 75,000-member National Union of Railway Workers wants a 10
percent pay increase. Management is offering 7 percent, which is
less than inflation.

   Residents returned to their
canyon neighborhood, thankful that a wind-whipped fire that leveled
13 homes and caused an estimated $4.3 million in damage wasn't more
devastating.
   Elsewhere, crews battled forest and brush fires in mostly remote
areas of Utah, where a blaze galloped toward gas lines, and in
Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico.
   Firefighters declared the Hacienda Heights blaze contained
Tuesday afternoon after completing a line around the smoldering
hills, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Joe Silva.
   Most of the firefighters who had battled the flames since Monday
were released, but 100 remained to hold the containment lines on the
1,500-acre blaze.
   Residents whose houses were passed over by flames hopscotching
through the neighborhood Monday returned to their homes to protect
them from looters. Four people were arrested for looting late
Monday, Silva said.
   ``I cannot believe they would want to take more from people who
already have lost almost everything,'' he said.
   Among those returning to the affluent area was George Podunovich,
who dug a shovel into what remained of his house. ``My birth
certificate, my diploma,'' he said. ``All my records _ they're
gone.''
   Also returning was Paul Lukather, who was grateful to discover
that his two-story Spanish-style house was untouched by
flames.Flames fanned by erratic winds came within 20 yards of the
house and consumed a small detached recreation room, he said.
   ``When you think what could have happened, this really was a
blessing,'' he said.
   Also returning was Don Younger, who was visiting friends on
Monday when he saw a plume of black smoke coming from his
neighborhood. When he tried to drive to his home, fire officials
would not allow him through, so he drove to a hill where he could
watch.
   ``I saw the firefighters down on their bellies saving my home. I
wish I could hug them all,'' he said.
   Authorities who surveyed the area Tuesday said 13 homes were
destroyed and eight were damaged. Losses were estimated at $4.3
million.
   Although as many as 600 people were evacuated Monday night, only
10 people spent the night at Los Altos High School, where the
American Red Cross opened an evacuation center.
   Fire officials said the cause was under investigation but was
probably man-made.
   Elsewhere in California, about 200 firefighters were dispatched
to the San Bernardino National Forest to battle a 150-acre blaze in
Santa Ana Canyon, 70 miles east of Los Angeles. It was declared 75
percent contained early today.
   In southeastern Utah, a fire about 20 miles west of the Colorado
line quadrupled in size Tuesday, consuming 7,000 acres by today in
the Flume Canyon Wilderness Study Area, said Mary Plumb of the
Bureau of Land Management.
   Plumb said that the fire, which at one point advanced two miles
in 40 minutes, was a half-mile from two gas compressor stations
owned by Northwest Pipeline and that the company was shutting down
the gas lines.
   A ranch and eight cabins were jeopardized when a 650-acre fire 20
miles north of Roosevelt grew to 1,800 acres in shifting winds, said
BLM spokesman Ray Tate. But winds died down late Tuesday, giving
fire officials time to hose down buildings and set back-burning
blazes.
   In southwestern New Mexico, a wind-driven fire charred about
5,000 acres in the Gila National Forest. More than 650 people, six
air tankers and seven helicopters fought the fire, which was started
by lightning Friday and spread by 30 mph wind.
   Fire officials earlier believed that Gila trout, which are listed
as an endangered species, were threatened by the blaze. But plans to
net the fish and take them to a hatchery were put on hold because
fire crews were able to build a buffer and protect their stream,
said Ken Palmrose, spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.
   Several fires in Colorado had been contained or controlled, but a
fire south of Dinosaur National Monument grew to 1,800 acres and
entered the Skull Creek Wilderness Study Area.
   Officials said early today that the fire was about 70 percent
contained and they hoped to have it fully surrounded by tonight.
   Wyoming firefighters were investigating whether a fire that had
scorched 1,000 acres in the Bridger-Teton National Forest by this
morning was started by fireworks, said Forest Service spokesman Fred
Kingwill.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Rejects Another Cabinet Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet legislators today rejected the nomination of
Nikolai S. Konarev to keep serving as minister of railways,
criticizing the safety record and shoddy service of railroads during
his administration, Tass said.
   It was the second rejection of a candidate put forth by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov in two days. On Monday, the Supreme Soviet voted
against Vladimir M. Kamentsev, who was nominated to oversee foreign
economic policy.
   ``Deputies expressed many sharp critical remarks concerning the
state of railways, traffic safety and the quality of passenger
service during the discussion of the candidate, who headed the
country's railway transport since 1982,'' the official news agency
said.
   Among the rail disasters reported under the policy of glasnost or
greater openness was an explosion that killed 600 people on June 4.
Authorities say the blast was caused by a spark from a railroad
electrical line, which ignited a highly flammable mixture of benzine
and propane-butane gas that leaked from a pipeline in the Ural
mountains near the city of Ufa.
   In May, an undisclosed number of people died when two freight
trains collided near Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, touching off an explosion.
   Last year, at least 118 people died in reported rail accidents,
including two incidents of trains carrying explosives blowing up in
rail yards.
   The vote against Konarev, who had been approved by parliamentary
committees and commissions, was 204-130, with 40 abstentions, Tass
said.
   The Supreme Soviet approved three other candidates for
ministerial posts, Tass reported.
   After a long discussion over pollution caused by the
metallurgical industry, the deputies approved the nomination of
Serafim V. Kolpakov as minister of metallurgy, Tass said.
   Since July 1985, five months after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
came to power, Kolpakov, 56, had headed the Ferrous Metallurgy
Ministry, which was combined recently with the Ministry of
Non-Ferrous Metallurgy.
   Also approved were Boris M. Belousov, 55, as minister of defense
industries and Oleg Shishkin, 55, as minister of machine building.
   ``A long list of candidates remains to be scrutinized: there are
some 40 names on it,'' Tass said.
   Since the Supreme Soviet convened June 26, replacing the old
rubber-stamp parliament of the same name, members have questioned
most Cabinet nominees and criticized many.
   Ryzhkov withdrew the names of seven nominees last week after
unfavorable committee hearings.

   A court said today that an Israeli accused of
shooting two Palestinians near Tel Aviv is a Jewish seminary student
who was freed on bail after being questioned about the slaying of an
Arab teen-ager.
   In the West Bank, Palestinians killed one Arab and tortured
another with razor blades and lighted cigarettes after accusing both
of collaborating with Israeli secret police, hospital officials and
Arab reports said.
   Arab reports today said the leader of the Palestinian Writers'
Association in the occupied lands was detained by troops for
refusing a soldier's order to paint over pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization grafitti outside his house.
   An Israeli army spokesman would not confirm or deny the reported
arrest of the official, magazine editor Assad Al-Assad.
   A Tel Aviv magistrate's court today lifted a gag order on
publishing the name of the 23-year-old Jewish settler who confessed
to shooting and wounding two Arab workers at a bus stop near Tel
Aviv on June 20.
   The settler, Rafi Solomon, was free on bail at the time after
being questioned about another shooting. Solomon said on army radio
today that he shot the two but denied taking part in other crimes.
   Solomon, who lives in the Yitzhar Jewish settlement in the West
Bank, is among eight students of Joseph's Tomb seminary arrested in
connection with an armed attack on Palestinians in the West Bank
village of Kifl Harith on May 29 in which a girl was killed and
another Palestinian wounded.
   Solomon is now in jail in connection with the shooting of the two
Arab workers. The court today extended his detention 10 days.
   Jewish settlers have been blamed for a series of raids on Arab
villages in recent weeks in apparent retaliation for stones and
firebombs thrown at their cars in the occupied lands.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the body of Jamil Kadoumi was
found in the central market today. His skull had been crushed and
his hands were tied behind his back, the reports said. The
32-year-old man was taken from his house by masked youths overnight,
his family said.
   Doctors in a Nablus hospital said a 17-year-old, Anjad Naaneesh,
received razor cuts and cigarette burns after masked youths abducted
him from his home Tuesday night. Both his arms and legs were broken.
   The two victims were suspected of collaborating with Israel's
Shin Bet secret police, Palestinian sources said.
   The attacks in Nablus came less than a day after Palestinians
killed money-changer Khalil Ata Najar, 47, who disobeyed orders from
the underground leadership of the uprising to sell currency at a
fixed price.
   Money-changers in Nablus did not open for business today in fear
of attacks, Palestinians said.
   The deaths in Nablus brought to at least 542 the number of
Palestinians killed in the nearly 19-month uprising against Israeli
rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-three Israelis also
have been killed in the unrest.

   China has ordered major joint-venture hotels in
Beijing to unhook satellite dishes that receive foreign news
broadcasts, mainly from Cable News Network, hotel officials said
today.
   Some hotels also receive the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and
Television Service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   Anyone with a satellite dish can receive the programming, and
hotels do not pay the networks or Chinese government for the service.
   An official at Beijing's Travel and Tourism Bureau said satellite
service was ordered cut because it is unfair.
   ``It is not universal in Beijing hotels. The Chinese hotels do
not have this service,'' said the official who identified himself
only as Sun.
   But Vito Maggiolo, CNN managing editor in Beijing, said: ``Our
guess is that they are concerned that the hotel staff is seeing it.''
   China is engaged in an intensive propaganda campaign to discredit
Western news accounts of a seven-week student movement for democracy
and a military crackdown on June 3-4.
   Chinese media have said nearly 100 soldiers and police died in
the crackdown and that thousands were injured, while about 100
civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as
high as 3,000.
   Sun said the order to cut cable reception was issued in January
but was enforced only in the past few days after the government
realized hotels had not heeded the first order.
   Hotels in Shanghai and Guangzhou said they have not been ordered
to cut satellite reception.
   Beijing hotel officials agreed the government order was issued
about six months ago but said there have been no previous attempts
to enforce it.
   The Great Wall Sheraton was the first to cut its satellite
service last month. It restored the service briefly this week,
reportedly because it realized other hotels were ignoring the order,
but cut it again less than 24 hours later.
   The Jiangguo Hotel, China's first joint-venture hotel, suspended
service Friday, the day after CNN broadcast a videotape of exiled
student leader Wu'er Kaixi saying he will never give up the struggle
for democracy in China.
   A hotel circular a few days later blamed technical difficulties
for the loss of programming.
   At least four other Beijing hotels _ the Shangri-La, Palace,
Kunlun and Holiday Inn Lido _ have cut satellite service.
   Questions and complaints from hotel guests elicited a variety of
responses, from blank looks to talk of mysterious technical problems.
   ``We are upset about it. But what can we do? We have to accept
it. We cannot fight it,'' a Jianguo hotel official said on condition
of anonymity.
   Sun said hotels that refuse to follow the order will not be
punished, but added that hotels in China should obey Chinese law.
   Joint ventures in China are between the government and private
foreign companies.

   President Bush today refused to comment on the
sentence imposed against former White House aide Oliver North and
the White House brushed aside questions about the possibility of a
pardon.
   Bush was in a meeting with White House aides when press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater went to the Oval Office to tell him that North had
received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a $150,000 fine
for his role in covering up his involvement in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``He didn't have any comment,'' Fitzwater said.
   The press spokesman said ``we don't think it's appropriate'' to
comment, noting the possibility of appeal for North.
   Fitzwater said the decision not to comment was ``coming from the
president. ... I know his thoughts on this.''
   As for a pardon, Fitzwater said, ``We haven't discussed a pardon.
There's been no discussion. It hasn't ever been discussed.''

   Two former PTL aides accused of diverting
$1.1 million from the evangelical empire built by Jim Bakker had
authorization to use ministry credit cards and take out cash
advances, their lawyer argued today.
   Brothers David and James Taggart went on trial today on federal
charges they failed to pay $487,000 in income taxes on the amount
from 1984 to 1987 and spent the money on such personal items as a
condominium, jewelry, luxury cars and clothing.
   The case is expected to bring out allegations of high living in
the inner sanctum of PTL before Bakker's downfall in a sex and money
scandal in 1987.
   But special prosecutor Joseph Bender told the jury the case is
not about Jim and Tammy Bakker or whether defendants collected
exorbitant salaries or bonuses.
   ``It's about the income the defendants failed to pay taxes on,''
he said.
   In his opening remarks, defense attorney Ben Cotten argued:
``This case is not about taxes _ we concede at the outset there are
some taxes owed by David and James. This is a case about
authorization, intent and doubt.''
   Cotten said witnesses and documents would show that his clients
had authorization from the highest levels of the TV ministry to use
PTL funds.
   Prosecutors allege that David Taggart, 32, who was Bakker's
personal aide, and his 35-year-old brother, James, PTL's former
interior decorator, used PTL credit cards to get big cash advances
and used blank PTL checks to pay American Express bills.
   If convicted, each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and
fined more than $1 million.
   A grand jury indicted the brothers in December, the same day PTL
founder Bakker and his former top aide, Richard Dortch, were
indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud for allegedly diverting
more than $4 million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring to
defraud PTL contributors.
   Bakker and Dortch's trial is set for Aug. 28. However, a hearing
was scheduled today on whether to move the trial because of heavy
publicity.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor wanted to hold the hearing behind
closed doors, but several news organizations appealed, and an
appeals court overruled him.
   The witness list in the Taggart trial looks like a ``Who's Who''
of TV evangelism.
   The prosecution may call evangelists Jerry Falwell, John Wesley
Fletcher, Rex Humbard and Rex Humbard Jr. Defense witnesses could
include Bakker's daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, and the Rev. Aimee
Cortese, a former PTL board member.
   The Taggarts bought a $660,000 condominium on Fifth Avenue in New
York and a $317,000 home in Charlotte. In 1986, they gave each other
Jaguars as Christmas presents at a cost of nearly $90,000.

   The Idaho Statesman, Boise, Idaho, on the Supreme Court's
abortion ruling:
   The Supreme Court opened the back door Monday and began chipping
away at Roe vs. Wade, the controversial suit that spawned a 1973
decision to legalize abortions.
   The justices ducked the core issue, refusing to consider whether
or not women have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion.
   Instead, they chose the more lengthy, painful process of taking
away abortion rights one rule and one regulation at a time.
   The deeply divided court did not enlighten or direct our troubled
nation either by its opinions or the reasoning used to reach them.
Its muddled message will divide us further by raising the specter
that abortions once again will be available to some, but not all.

   Philadelphia Daily News on the abortion ruling:
   It's easy to see why the Supreme Court of the United States took
so long to announce its opinion in the latest abortion case. It took
that long to jury-rig a majority out of some of the most specious
reasoning in the annals of making the law fit the desired conclusion.
   Although the parties in the suit and others who chose to join the
fight based much of their arguments on the right to privacy, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and his accomplices found that line of
reasoning entirely too clear, too far from the conclusion they
wanted to reach.
   Instead, they used the astonishing conclusion that the
Constitution does not specifically mention the magic words
``trimester'' and ``viability.'' Seldom has such an intelligent
group used such pinheaded logic.
   The claim that the old law is undisturbed is an inelegant
judicial lie. There will be legislation introduced in this state and
others to make abortion as uncomfortable, risky and expensive as
possible.
   The difference between before Monday and after is that the
enemies of privacy now know that the fix is in.

   July 4
   The Tennessean, Nashville, Tenn., on the abortion ruling:
   It was tragic to see the U.S. Supreme Court knock its first chip
out of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that guarantees women the right
to an abortion.
   ... There is no doubt that the court's ruling will give impetus
to the anti-abortion forces. People in every state will push for the
most restrictive state laws the courts will allow.
   Lawmakers should remember that safe abortions have always been
available _ and always will be available _ to women with the money
to pay for them. The states can't write a law that can't be bypassed
with enough dough.
   Wealthy women will be able to shop around for a sympathetic
physician or travel to a state with less restrictive laws. But what
about women who can't afford to take off work and leave their
families for a sudden ``vacation'' to New York? What about women who
don't have adequate health care and certainly can't afford to shop
around for a doctor who will give the necessary approval?
   Those women _ the poor and middle-income, the uninsured and the
unemployed, the young _ will do what they did before Roe. They'll
seek out illegal, unsafe abortions. ... Some of them will have their
babies and give them up. But some of them will just give up their
lives. ...

   July 5
   The Miami Herald, on the Supreme Court's abortion ruling:
   The worst fears of pro-choice advocates did not materialize in
the fractured, and fractious, Reagan Court's abortion ruling. But
the anti-abortion repression of the pre-1973 years now has a
detectable heartbeat that it has not had since Roe vs. Wade. For
women's liberty and equality, that inchoate viability is indeed
evident, ominous, and chilling.
   If abortion were not already a heated issue, the Supreme Court
now has made it white-hot. The Court's long-awaited decision on a
Missouri law challenging the epochal 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
guarantees years more of political turmoil and emotional litigation.
... It in effect told women that they leave their control of their
lives at the door if they must consult a public clinic or hospital.
...
   While the prohibition on using tax money for actual abortions can
be defended, the prohibition on counseling at public facilities
cannot. Moreover, this prohibition will deprive poor and rich woman
alike of their choice of doctors because so many physicians practice
at public hospitals.
   Such a willingness by the Court to permit legislative tinkering
is a clear invitation to the states to reduce abortion rights
inchmeal. What strictures will the Court next approve? Will it allow
legislatures to ban sterilization or dispensing of birth-control
information at public facilities, even for paying patients? And if a
legislature now may mandate fetal-viability tests, will it next be
permitted to mandate procedures? To outlaw abortion beyond the first
trimester or altogether?

   Rain pounded the Middle Atlantic region today, stopping trains
along Amtrak's busy Northeast corridor. The West braced for another
scorcher after Independence Day heat set records from North Dakota
to California.
   The Philadelphia area was soaked with more than 8 inches of rain
in 24 hours, with some suburbs reporting 5 to 7 inches in two hours
this morning. A street in Essington, Pa., was under 3 feet of water.
Heavy rain also fell in Maryland-Delaware area, the mountains of
Virginia and the central Gulf Coast.
   Water rushed over tracks along several sections of Amtrak's line
between Washington and New York. Some trains were canceled and
others had to reverse direction and return to the station.
Passengers were bused between stations.
   Trains ordinarily leave Washington and New York every half hour,
carrying about 20,000 passengers a day.
   On Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms drenched much of the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts, flooding roads and swelling rivers and
streams.
   Hamilton County, Tenn., was pelted with 1.35 inches of rain in 40
minutes; 1{ inches of rain fell in two hours in New Paris, Pa.; 6\
inches poured down on Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina in a
24-hour period.
   Flash flood watches were in effect this morning for most of
Virginia and Maryland and parts of North Carolina, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania.
   Lakes and rivers continued to flood in Louisiana because of heavy
rains during the past week. Four feet of water covered about five
miles of Highway 9, which was closed between Campti and Creston.
   A large upper-level high pressure system brought record heat from
the upper Mississippi Valley across the Plains to California.
   It was 121 degrees at Blythe, Calif., and the 118-degree high in
Phoenix broke a 17-year-old mark for the date. Record highs also
were recorded at Tucson, Ariz.; Jamestown, N.D. and Laramie, Wyo.
Heat records for the date were tied in Duluth, Minn., and Salt Lake
City.
   The forecast Wednesday was for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from much of the Atlantic Coast across the
Appalachians into the Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys, with
strong thunderstorms from North Dakota to northern Minnesota.
   Predicted highs: 70s across northern Maine; 70s and 80s in the
northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest; 80s in much of the
Southeast, the Great Lakes and northern Atlantic Coast; above 90 in
southern Georgia and Florida, from the upper Mississippi Valley
across the Plains, and from the central and southern Rockies to
inland California; and over 100 from the Rio Grande Valley into
southern California; and 110 to 120 in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., and Olympia, Wash., to 97 at Glendale,
Ariz.

   Heavy rain moved into the mid-Atlantic region today, stopping
trains along Amtrak's busy Northeast corridor, one day after causing
flash floods that forced the evacuation of hundreds of campers in
the mountains of North Carolina.
   The remains of Tropical Storm Allison, which have dumped rain on
the South for more than a week, left a trail of damage from the
Tennessee Valley to the Northeast.
   A band of heavy rain pounded the Maryland-Delaware area and
Philadelphia today. The city got 5.5 inches of rain in two hours,
with some suburbs logging up to 7 inches. A street in the suburb of
Essington was under 3 feet of water.
   Water rushed over tracks along several sections of Amtrak's line
between Washington and New York. Some trains were canceled and
others had to reverse direction and return to the station.
Passengers were bused between stations.
   Trains ordinarily leave Washington and New York every half hour,
carrying about 20,000 passengers a day.
   ``Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train
operations severly disrupted and will presumably not be back in full
operation for at least several hours,'' Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black
said shortly before noon.
   Black said crews would have to assess any damage to track beds
before trains could resume.
   In western North Carolina, one woman was swept away in her tent
Tuesday and presumed dead after a creek overflowed its banks in the
Pisgah National Forest. Her husband was rescued from the tent as it
was carried downstream.
   Officials spotted the tent this morning, said Collettsville Fire
Chief Jerry Gragg. ``The best we can gather right now, the tent
traveled 500 to 600 feet before becoming lodged'' in some branches,
he said.
   The latest fatality brought the death toll to 14 since since
Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week ago. Five have died in
Mississippi, four in Texas, three in Louisiana and two in North
Carolina.
   ``It was unbelievable how many people were up there camping in
all the bad weather,'' said firefighter Rusty Dellinger.
   Workers rescued about 30 backpackers and hikers stranded by the
creek's swirling waters by Tuesday evening, and officials today
searched for others who may have been stranded in the rain-soaked
Blue Ridge Mountains.
   ``I'm a nervous wreck. I've got to get out of here,'' said Elaine
Self, 28. ``It's my first time camping here. I'm never coming back.''
   ``I think it's the worst it's been here since the flood of
1940,'' said Tom Huskins Jr., general manager of the Grandfather
Mountain resort in Avery County, where more than 6 inches of rain
fell in 24 hours through Tuesday afternoon.
   Avery County Sheriff Clinton Phillips said officials ordered the
evacuation Tuesday morning of about 400 people because of fears a
32-foot concrete and earth dam across Land Harbor Lake would give
way. State inspectors proclaimed the dam safe but deputies continued
to monitor it.
   More than 1{ inches of rain have fallen since Monday, and the
National Weather Service said up to 2 inches more was likely, with
up to 4 inches in some areas.
   About 60 people returned to their homes Tuesday in Spring City,
Tenn., one day after nearly 5 inches of rain forced their evacuation
from the farming community north of Chattanooga. It was the third
time in three weeks floods had forced evacuations in the area.
   ``We're kind of getting tired of it,'' said Gene Wright, director
of the Rhea County Emergency Management Agency.
   Wright said 400 homes, 21 businesses and seven cars and trucks
were damaged by floodwaters that stood up to four feet deep before
beginning to recede early Tuesday.
   Tuesday's storms dumped about 2} inches of rain in the
Chattanooga area, and more thunderstorms were expected through the
weekend.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority reported that June's big rainfall
produced the highest runoff into the region's streams in 114 years
of record keeping _ 4.10 inches.
   More rain fell Tuesday on Mississippi, where some cotton and
soybean crops have been ruined and two counties were declared
disaster areas. The Coahoma Sheriff's Office said most of the 200
people evacuated from their flooded houses probably would be able to
return by tonight.
   In Texas, an estimated 500 residents in low-lying areas of
Liberty County, northeast of Houston, remained out of their flooded
homes Tuesday because of Allison's heavy rains.
   Allison caused an estimated $1 billion in damage in Texas alone,
officials have said.
   In Dallas, an estimated 9,000 homes were still without
electricity in the wake of a storm that swept the city Sunday night
with winds up to 90 mph.
   About 700 homes have flooded in Louisiana in the last week and a
half as Allison dumped more than two feet of rain in places,
authorities estimated.
   Officials in Winn Parish continued to watch a small earthen dam
weakened by the storm and waters continued to rise in flooded
neighborhoods of Rapides Parish.
   ``Water is rising about 12 inches in a 24-hour time frame,'' said
Bill Godron, Alexandria-Rapides Parish Civil Defense director.
   ``Of course this is all contingent on no more rainfall,'' Godron
said. ``We're supposed to have more rain through Friday.''

   A Soviet nuclear submarine that caught fire
last week off Norway leaked small amounts of radiation, and its
reactor may have come close to a meltdown, a Norwegian scientist
said.
   Traces of radioactive Iodine 131 were found in a water sample
taken two days after the June 26 fire aboard the Echo II class
vessel 70 miles off Norway's coast in the Norwegian Sea, state
researchers said Tuesday.
   Knut Gussgard, director of the Norwegian Nuclear Energy Safety
Board, said the submarine apparently ``suffered what is called a
loss of coolant accident, which is what can lead to a meltdown.''
   Gussgard said the radioactive iodine is a byproduct of nuclear
fission, which means the ``core must have leaked coolant, exposing
(uranium) fuel rods that may have burst or even began to melt.''
   Support for the possibility of a meltdown came from Finn
Ugletveit of the Norwegian Radiation Hygiene Institute. ``The
chances that this kind of radiation came from anything but the core
are slim,'' he said.
   Ugletveit, whose institute conducted the radiation tests, said
the radioactive Iodine 131 was ``diluted by seawater and we expect
it to disappear completely very quickly. All other air and water
tests showed no radiation.''
   Tass on Monday said four sailors were hospitalized and were being
examined for possible radiation poisoning. But the news agency said
today that the four ``were healthy and have no excess radiation.''
   Tass quoted Lt. Gen. Igor Sinoplanikov of the Soviet Defense
Ministry as saying a decontamination of the submarine's crew was
carried out June 28, the day the vessel returned to Soviet naval
base at Murmansk. ``This was done to dispel fears of the sailors and
their relatives,'' Sinoplanikov said.
   In a message to the Norwegian government recieved on Friday,
Moscow said the reactor's primary cooling system leaked, but the
system's design guaranteed the security of the reactor, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
   Gussgard said the size of a submarine reactor is about 2 percent
of a power plant such as Chernobyl, which caused an environmental
disaster after a 1986 nuclear accident.
   ``A submarine reactor is so small that we probably wouldn't see
an environmental catastrophe. But if there was a meltdown off
Norway, we might experience radiation levels similar to those that
passed over Norway and Sweden after Chernobyl,'' he said.
   Chernobyl fallout contaminated livestock and fish in parts of
Norway and Sweden, as well as parts of eastern Europe.
   With two accidents in three months among the 100 nuclear
submarines of the Soviet North Fleet Base near Norway, Gussgard said
a major accident no longer seems theoretical.
   On April 7, a Soviet MIKE class nuclear submarine sank off
Norway, killing 42 Soviet sailors.

   Roman Catholic groups said Wednesday
the government is engaging in political revenge in its investigation
of an opposition lawmaker who visited North Korea.
   The church groups accused the government of trying the case in
the media against Suh Kyung-won, a National Assemblyman charged with
violation of national security laws for visiting the communist
nation.
   The government maintains that contact with North Korea must be
made only through official channels.
   The Agency for National Security Planning, the intelligence arm
of the government, was expected to question Cardinal Stephen Kim in
the case. Suh, a Catholic, told South Korea's Roman Catholic prelate
about his trip after he returned.
   The cardinal said he regarded Suh's conversation about the trip
as private and felt his moral obligation as a priest required him to
remain silent.
   ``Laws are no longer laws, but political reprisals or violence if
laws run counter to human nature and justice,'' said a statement
issued at a news conference Wednesday by Catholic groups, which
included the Justice and Peace Committee of the Korean Catholic
Church.
   ``The article in the national security law forcing a father to
inform against his son, a priest against a believer, a reporter
against his news source and people against each other is
fundamentally against human ethics and the spirit of laws,'' said
the statement.
   The opposition Party for Peace and Democracy to which Suh
belonged said it lodged a protest Tuesday with Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon, accusing the government of exploiting the affair to
discredit the leading opposition party.
   Suh is under arrest after turning himself in June 25 for
traveling to see North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in August 1988 to
discuss unification of the peninsula. The government bans
unauthorized travel to North Korea and maintains dialogue must be
conducted through official channels.
   Prosecutors, concerned that both Suh and North Korea kept his
visit secret for 10 months, broadened the investigation to look into
three other trips Suh has taken overseas since 1985.
   Sources said the Agency for National Security Planning was
looking into the source of campaign funds Suh received for his April
1988 election and into money an aide allegedly received for him from
a North Korean agent in West Germany.
   Warrants were issued for eight people, including Suh's
girlfriend, who were charged with failing to report his trip to
authorities. All but one, who was hospitalized, were in jail.
Several dozen have been summoned for questioning.
   The peninsula was divided north and south at the end of World War
II. The North invaded the South in 1950 to start the bloody
three-year Korean War. A peace treaty was never signed and the two
Koreas remain bitter enemies.
   Also Wednesday, riot police clashed with students staging an
anti-government rally at Dongkook University that drew about 200
demonstrators.
   The clash came a day after hundreds of students battled riot
police in rallies called to support a Seoul student Im Suk-young,
who visited North Korea for the 13th World Festival of Youth and
Students, which ends July 8.
   The government said she would be arrested and charged with
national security violations when she returns home.

   For 10 years famed Kung Fu novelist and
publisher Louis Cha has been wielding the might of his newspaper in
support of Communist China's reform program.
   Now he feels a man betrayed _ betrayed by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping, who ordered the killing of unarmed protesters in Beijing,
and by the People's Liberation Army, who carried out the order.
   Sitting in his ornate office, decorated with pillars covered in
gold leaf and imitation French Renaissance furniture, Cha appears to
be a profoundly disturbed man.
   ``I am very, very sad,'' he said in an interview. ``My hopes for
my country _ to be strong, to have steady progress _ are weak now. I
see bad things in the future.''
   Cha, 65, belongs to a large group of Chinese living overseas who
for decades have carried atorch of patriotism for their motherland.
   Some sent back thousands of dollars for their families, others
designed buildings in China, still others returned to help the
country's development. Cha, for his part, wrote.
   From the early 1950s when he published his first novel, Cha has
pumped out 36 volumes of rollicking Kung Fu adventures in ancient
China.
   In addition, in the 30 years since he started the newspaper Ming
Pao with four friends and the royalties from his successful novels,
Cha has written hundreds of editorials on his country and on the
future of the British colony of Hong Kong.
   In that time, his paper has grown from two pages to about 42,
from a gutsy voice of the patriotic opposition to one of the leading
intellectual Chinese-language papers in the world.
   Cha, who is from the southern Chinese city of Hangzhou, began his
life as a journalist for Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Communist newspaper then
based in Shanghai.
   He left the mainland in 1948, a year before the communist
takeover, and came to Hong Kong to open the paper's office in the
British colony.
   Like many young Chinese of his generation, Cha supported the
goals of the Communists and worked to communicate them in the pages
of the party-backed paper.
   But then came 1957 and with it China's first big political
movement, the anti-rightist campaign. Thousands of intellectuals
were purged and imprisoned for criticizing the government.
   ``I was disillusioned with the Communists distorting the truth,''
he said. ``So I quit and started my own newspaper.'' In 1959, Ming
Pao hit the stands.
   In the 1960s, as China collapsed into the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution, Cha opposed the campaigns against intellectuals and
high-ranking cadres such as Deng and former head of government Liu
Shao-ch'i.
   Communist-backed organizations in Hong Kong issued death threats.
Several bombs were delivered to the paper although none went off.
Cha was placed under police protection.
   When Deng seized power in 1978 and announced a reform program to
open China to the outside world and develop its economy, Cha backed
him with all his editorial might.
   Cha's usefulness to the Chinese government was heightened when,
after a 23-year absence, he returned to the mainland in 1981 and met
with Deng, a fan of Cha's novels, and other top leaders.
   During the early days of the student movement in April, Cha's
paper praised the government for not cracking down on the students.
   But on May 20, martial law was ordered. Cha resigned from his
post on the Chinese legislature and sent letters of protest to
Beijing, urging Deng to talk with the students.
   On June 3-4, Cha stayed home with his wife and watched the
account of the massacre on television.
   A few days later, he appeared on local TV with tears in his eyes
and condemned the violence.
   ``Who could have expected that the magnificent ideals would
vanish into thin air in less than one month?'' he wrote in an
editorial June 11. ``Is it that the encouragement we had and the
belief we held in the past ten or more years are nothing but an
illusion, nothing but a fond dream?''
   China began to criticize Cha's paper.
   On July 1, the People's Daily scolded Ming Pao for
``rumor-mongering.'' President Yang Shangkun called Cha ``an old
anti-communist,'' according to Cha.
   Cha is not optimistic about the future. He has canceled plans to
retire to Hangzhou and is considering leaving Hong Kong for another
country.
   ``If I stay here after 1997, I am afraid they will settle their
accounts with me and it will be dangerous,'' he said. ``I am worried
for me and for my wife.''
   As for his paper, Cha believes the communist takeover will see
more censorship, whether forced or self-imposed. And he fears for
the rest of Hong Kong as well.
   ``Our fates are tied to one another now. As China goes, Hong Kong
will follow,'' he said.
   And finally, Louis Cha fears for his motherland.
   ``They have set my country back years by killing the beautiful
old hundred names,'' he said using the Chinese expression for common
people. ``For that they should never be forgiven.''

PICKS UP 14th graf pvs, `Stolar, whose ...' ^By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish has replaced the Yiddish and Polish that
filled the West Side tenements where Abe Stolar grew up, but the
rundown buildings and littered streets still held their charm after
58 years.
   ``I didn't expect anything. That's what keeps me young.
Everything I get is a gift,'' said the 77-year-old Chicago native,
returning to the neighborhood he left at age 19 for the Soviet Union.
   Accompanied by his Soviet-born wife, Gita Rozovskaya, and Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., who helped draw attention to the family's
14-year fight to leave the Soviet Union, Stolar explored the
once-familiar streets, stopping in front of the rehabilitated flat
where he lived for three years during high school and pointing out
the building where he worked at a photo-engraving shop.
   Many of the buildings are covered with graffiti and gang slogans.
Many doors and windows are barred.
   ``I feel like a baby. It's like opening my eyes and seeing what
the world is like for the first time,'' Stolar said.
   Stolar, who used to lie awake homesick in his Moscow bed _ almost
smelling the flowers of a Chicago rose garden and hearing the roar
of the elevated trains _ returned on Tuesday, the Fourth of July.
   ``I really can't find words,'' he told a crowd of well-wishers
and reporters as he stepped off a flight at O'Hare International
Airport. ``God bless you all. It's wonderful to be here.''
   Stolar was traveling from Israel, where he immigrated earlier
this year from the Soviet Union. He plans to get reacquainted with
his hometown and tour the nation. Tonight, he was to visit Wrigley
Field, which looks pretty much the same except for the lights that
will allow him to take in a night game.
   Stolar, whose Russian-Jewish parents immigrated to America in
1910, was raised on the Northwest Side. But the family returned to
their homeland in 1931 during the Great Depression, believing that
the Bolshevik Revolution had created a workers' paradise.
   It turned out to be more of a nightmare for the family.
   Stolar's father died in the Stalinist purges, and his mother and
sister were sent to camps in Siberia.
   Stolar, just 19 when he arrived in the Soviet Union, served in
the Red Army during World War II. He was wounded by a German hand
grenade and lost the sight in one eye.
   He then worked as a translator and announcer for Radio Moscow,
married and had a son. But in a country where Jews have long been
harassed, he felt isolated. And in the early 1970s, Stolar wanted
out.
   Promises that he could leave were repeatedly broken by Soviet
officials, who refused to let Stolar's whole family leave.
   ``I was an alien there for all the 58 years I was there,'' Stolar
said. ``It was a crime they didn't let me out.''
   Simon met Stolar during a trip to Moscow in 1980, and contacted
Soviet officials and U.S. diplomats in efforts to secure Stolar's
release.
   Freedom didn't come until March, when Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev allowed Stolar, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and two
grandchildren to leave for Israel.
   ``What can I say, really?'' Stolar asked Tuesday, expressing
gratitude to Simon and the media for publicizing his plight. ``I
can't say anything but thank you, thank you, thank you!''
   Stolar used to love to walk the downtown streets, taking peeks
inside the lobbies of the grand hotels. His dream of one day staying
in the fancy, 3,000-room Stevens Hotel has come true.
   From the airport, he went to the hotel, now the Chicago Hilton
and Towers, which is putting up the Stolars in its 23rd-floor
Chicago Suite.
   No special menu is planned during Stolar's week-long stay _ he's
``a junk-food junkie'' who likes hamburgers and hot dogs, said
assistant manager Peter Borup.
   Other stops on the Stolars' 12-city U.S. tour include Anchorage,
Alaska, and Miami. The trip ends Aug. 13 in Los Angeles.
   Their visit was arranged and financed by Chicago Action for
Soviet Jewry.

   A crane operator was knocked to the ground and
critically injured Wednesday when the counterweight of his crane
smashed a hole in a passing subway train, authorities said.
   Frank Davila, 54, of the borough of Queens, was in critical,
guarded condition at Kings County Hospital, said a hospital
spokeswoman, Lucille Parris. Transit Authority officials said he
suffered head and hand injuries.
   No other injuries were reported.
   The crane, a light piece of equipment that can ride on the rails
or on the street, was operating on one subway track adjacent to
another in Brooklyn when the accident occurred about 10 a.m., said
Bob Previdi, a Transit Authority spokesman.
   The counterweight, the backside of the crane's arm, struck the
train and ``it punched a hole 4 feet wide and 1 foot deep into the
train,'' said another TA spokesman, Jared Lebow. Davila suffered his
injuries when he was knocked to the ground.

<HEAD>Israeli Movie on Uprising: When Senseless Killing Becomes the Norm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Israeli film on the Palestinian
uprising brings three generations of Jews to the green fields of the
occupied West Bank and says they failed to recognize when senseless
killing becomes the norm.
   Director Isaac Zepel Yeshuron pronounces his protagonists _ an
Israeli living in the United States, his Berkeley-educated wife and
their soldier son _guilty of accepting violence as the only way to
handle the rebellion in which more than 540 Arabs have died.
   The level of that violence steadily increases in the film, from
beatings to the chilling climax of murder that left some viewers
crying after this week's premiere.
   This is the aim of Yeshuron, who wants to break ``that mechanism
of both knowing and ignoring created by people who wish to have a
bearable life.''
   ``This movie was made so that things would become known,'' he
said in an Israel radio interview this week.
   Yeshuron's ``Green Fields'' is one of three new Israeli movies
devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were screened at
the Jerusalem Film Festival, where 130 films from 44 countries are
being screened June 29-July 8.
   Yehuda Judd Neeman's action-packed ``Streets of Yesterday''
portrays an Israeli named Raz becoming entangled in an international
intrigue involving Palestinian guerrillas, Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency and West Germany's secret service. Raz is an
Israeli peace campaigner who helps an Arab friend belonging to a
Palestinian guerrilla group. In the end, his friend is shot to death
and he is on the run as an accomplice.
   ``End of the Orange Season,'' by director Lihi Hanoch, takes the
viewer on a journey with iconoclastic Israeli rock singer Shalom
Hanoch and his friends through the tense summer of 1988. It is a
compendium of protest music generated when the stone-throwing revolt
reached its peak and Israeli politicians campaigned in national
elections that ended in stalemate.
   ``Green Fields'' is the most gripping of the Israeli entries,
which include a retrospective on the immigration of Iraqi Jews and a
comedy on kibbutz life. It is favored to win the $20,000 award for
best Israeli director and producer and the $10,000 prize for the
most promising Israeli filmmaker.
   The Braverman family _ grandparents, son Shmulik, on a visit with
his American wife, and soldier Rami _ are on their way to an army
ceremony in the occupied West Bank.
   Hitching a ride in a Jewish settler's van, the Bravermans end up
in a Palestinian village under curfew, where masked stone-throwing
youths rule the streets.
   As the first stone hits the car, all taboos come loose, and the
Bravermans act like Israeli soldiers battling the almost 19-month
rebellion.
   They beat up a Palestinian youth, forcing him to remove a
makeshift stone barricade. Then they tie him to the hood of their
car to avoid being stoned, almost killing the youth in the process.
   Rami erupts in violence after capturing another Palestinian who
tried to grab a gun. The Jewish settler then calmly shoots the Arab
in the leg.
   The Bravermans escape and find themselves in the wilderness of
the West Bank. Shmulik, armed with his son's rifle, forces two Arabs
out of a passing jeep he needs to escape.
   ``This is a crime,'' one of the Palestinians keeps repeating
until Shmulik, driven mad, shoots and kills him.
   In addition to Shmulik's blind violence, Yeshuron condemns the
grandparents for whom ``business was as usual.''
   He also attacks the wife who cries, not for the persecution of
the Arabs, ``but for her husband and her marriage falling apart in
front of her eyes.''
   Rami, he concludes, ``did not recognize that point in space and
time beyond which the killing starts.''

   Police are investigating the shooting of two
persons on the Washington Monument grounds during a Fourth of July
fireworks display that drew about 425,000 people.
   Authorities said Stephen Hill, 17, was taken to the Washington
Hospital Center with a gunshot wound to the buttocks, while
Dahkishan Rollins, 15, was taken to Children's National Medical
Center with a gunshot wound to the knee. Both were from Landover, Md.
   Police were searching for five to eight male teen-agers believed
to have been involved in the shooting, said Park Police Sgt. Robert
Kass.
   Several people were trampled in the incident, said district
police spokesman Sgt. Joe Gentile. They were treated at the scene
for minor injuries.
   The annual fireworks show had been in doubt for most of the day
because of rain, and only about 20,000 people attended the
traditional parade down Constitution Avenue on Tuesday afternoon.
   However, the rain let up in time to permit the fireworks, which
were the finale to an outdoor concert by the National Symphony
Orchestra on the Capitol grounds at the other end of the Mall.
   Altogether, police reported about a dozen arrests Tuesday, mostly
for disorderly conduct and vending violations.
   The sparse parade crowd was cheerful about the weather, donning
plastic sheeting, umbrellas and makeshift trashbag ponchos to watch
the marching bands and floats go by.
   ``Everybody was smiling and being more congenial because we had
the bad weather as a common denominator,'' said John Shaw, who came
from Augusta, Maine, with his wife Sue.
   Street vendors were less pleased.
   David Gomez, who came from Atlanta to sell plastic American flags
which he carted around on two wooden placards, said, ``It's not as
many people as I'd like to be out here.'' It took him two hours to
sell 10 flags.

<TEXT>
   Migrant farm workers, drawn by the hope
of work and good pay, have poured into the Red River Valley this
year in what may be record numbers, but what they've found is a
shortage of work and housing.
   ``We enjoy coming here,'' said Gracie Gallegos, who augments her
salary as a school secretary in Crystal Springs, Texas, by working
two to three weeks each summer in the Minnesota sugar beet fields.
   ``We have bills to pay like everybody else. But it's sad this
year because we've had so much difficulty finding a home.''
   City officials acknowledge the housing market is tight. But they
say providing new housing is beyond the community's means and will
require state and federal assistance.
   ``We have neither the resources nor the inclination to build
housing for transients ... (housing) that would only be occupied for
a few months each year,'' said Mike McDonald, city zoning
administrator. ``It would be unfair to local residents to pay for
such housing.''
   In the meantime, migrant workers overwhelm a homeless shelter
operated by Sister Justina Violette, who believes the city is not
doing enough to provide affordable housing for migrants and other
low-income people who stay in the area from May through July. This
year, they began arriving in March.
   As many as 70 migrants spend the night in the crowded shelter,
and another 20 sleep in a 16- by 32-foot army tent on the lawn
outside. Others sleep in their cars and pickups in the center's
parking lot and some sleep under trees in an adjacent city park.
   Gallegos, 40, and her family have been coming to the Crookston
area for 35 years and have never had difficulty finding a home to
rent. This year they were forced to seek shelter at Sister Justina's
center.
   Migrant workers, mostly Hispanic Texans, have been making the
1,500-mile trek to the Red River Valley and this northwestern
Minnesota town of about 8,500 for decades. They are paid to thin and
weed sugar beets that are grown for local processing plants. Workers
can earn as much as $90 a day.
   But farmers use mechanical thinners now, and chemicals are
replacing labor for controlling weeds, said Armando Cuellar, migrant
labor counselor for the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training.
   That means less demand for workers, except in a drought year like
last season when chemicals did not work as well. Last year's high
demand may have lured migrants to the valley this year with false
hopes, Cuellar said.
   As many as 5,000 workers this year are in the valley in Minnesota
and North Dakota, said Richard Fitzsimons, executive director of the
Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association.
   About 1,900 people looking for work have registered with the
Department of Jobs and Training in Crookston and East Grand Forks,
Cuellar said. Last year at this time, 600 to 800 workers had signed
up. Cuellar was unable to estimate how many migrants would be able
to find steady work.
   ``I've been here 13 years and this is the most (available) labor
I've had,'' Cuellar said. ``This is an unusual year ... the
chemicals have worked very well because the weather has been
perfect. That's meant less field work.''
   In the past, growers provided housing for the workers on their
farmsteads.
   However, strict new federal regulations have made that more
difficult in recent years, leaving migrants with nowhere else to go
but into the communities.
   Sister Justina accuses some Crookston residents of being
prejudiced in their treatment of the Hispanic workers. She notes
some landlords require large damage deposits and longterm rental
contracts for migrants.
   ``People in small towns are used to seeing only one color,'' she
said. ``I don't think they realize how beautiful a rainbow is. The
minute they see someone of a different color they look down on
them.''
   McDonald said he does not see the problem as being racial in
nature.
   ``This never was a racial issue,'' he said. ``I see it as a group
issue. We've got a large number of people coming into a system that
is ill-equipped to deal with them.''

<HEAD>Shamir Accepts Conditions On Election Plan For Occupied Lands</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines urgent series. Raises higher Shamir's demand that settlements
continue, elements of the original election plan, PLO reaction. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today
turned back a challenge to his leadership by hard-liners in the
Likud bloc who opposed his election plan for peace negotiations.
   But in reaching a compromise, Shamir accepted the positions of
his rivals and may have burdened his Middle East peace initiative
with conditions that make it unacceptable to Palestinians.
   In a rousing speech before the party's central committee, Shamir
endorsed opponents' demands that east Jerusalem Arabs be excluded
from voting and that the violence of the Palestinian uprising be
ended as a pre-condition for peace negotiations. He also pledged to
continue Jewish settlements and said Israel would not accept a
Palestinian state or the participation of the PLO.
   Moshe Katzav, a Shamir backer, said the compromise was to include
the principles in the speech without voting on amendments to put the
hard-line stands into the peace initiative.
   But Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who had led the opposition, said
on Israel radio after the meeting: ``This decision is binding on the
representatives of the Likud in the Cabinet.''
   The plan was approved 20-6 on May 14 by the coalition Cabinet,
which includes the left-of-center Labor Party.
   The compromise was a victory for Shamir, who had threatened to
resign if the rebel faction voted against his plan.
   But it may have limited his room for maneuver in future
negotiations. Shamir's policy speech, which included four points
demanded by the rebels, was adopted with an overwhelming show of
hands in support.
   Officials have said the peace plan's lack of specifics was
designed to appeal to Palestinians by leaving controversial points
to later negotiations.
   But the points raised in Shamir's speech, especially his pledge
to continue Jewish settlements and exclude east Jerusalem Arabs,
were certain to alienate Palestinians.
   ``The settlements will continue,'' said Shamir, rebuffing U.S.
requests that Jewish settlements are an obstacle to peace. ``I want
to send heartfelt, warm blessings to settlers in Judea, Samaria
(West Bank) and Gaza, and I tell you, your suffering is not in vain
... be strong.''
   The election plan, which has U.S. support, calls for choosing
Palestinians in the occupied lands to negotiate an autonomy plan
with Israel. After three years, separate talks would be held on the
final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians and the
PLO have criticized the proposal, saying it does not lead to their
goal of an independent state.
   Demanding an end to the Palestinian uprising, Shamir said:
``There will be no negotiations as long as there is violence ... We
shall wipe it out.''
   The nearly 19-month uprising has led to the deaths of more than
540 Palestinians and 23 Israelis.
   Bending to the demand of his rivals that Arab east Jerusalem not
be allowed to vote in the elections, Shamir said: ``Jerusalem is not
part of the initiative. Jerusalem is the eternal capital of our
people and our state.''
   A key Palestinian demand has been giving the vote to 140,000 Arab
residents in the city's eastern sector, which was captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shamir drew loud applause and chants when he called on the United
States to end its dialogue with PLO leaders, who he said ``have not
deviated one inch from their criminal ways.''
   Chaim Morad, a Sharon backer, said the challenge was meant to
ensure Shamir will not be pushed by the United States into making
too many compromises to achieve peace. ``The prime minister is being
pushed too far to the left,'' he said. ``We want him to be able to
stand up to the Americans and say: `I can't do any more. My party
won't let me.'''
   Shamir's media adviser, Yossi Ahimeir, said the prime minister's
plan was intended to outmaneuver his rivals by making his speech the
issue of the vote, thus avoiding a direct challenge to the peace
plan.
   Since introducing the elections proposal in April, Shamir has
repeatedly said he would not give up land in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza or agree to negotiate with the PLO.
   But he had also insisted on no changes in his election plan.
   The United States has supported the plan as a way of getting the
stalled Middle East peace process moving and has tried to sell the
plan to the PLO and Arab states.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III has called on Israel to
accept the U.S.-backed policy of trading land for peace as a way of
persuading the Palestinians to agree to the vote.
   Before today's committee vote, Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokeman,
said that the challenge was serious. ``It is a real political test
for Shamir and his peace plan. One goes with the other,'' Pazner
said in an interview.
   Aides said privately that a vote against Shamir could have
jeopardized the plan and forced Shamir to resign.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Francois Mitterrand appealed today for an immediate cease-fire in
Lebanon and an end to arms deliveries to Lebanese groups involved in
the conflict.
   In a statement after two days of talks, the leaders said they
supported attempts by the Arab League to settle the Lebanese civil
war but also said their countries were available to help with other
efforts to reach a peaceful settlement ``notably in the framework of
the United Nations Security Council.''
   France and the Soviet Union are among the five permanent members
of the Security Council.
   The statement said Gorbachev and Mitterrand ``are convinced that
Lebanon must remain sovereign, independent, united, with its
territorial integrity respected.''
   It said they ``called for an immediate cease-fire, rigorously
respected, as an indispensable condition for the establishment of a
constructive inter-Lebanese dialogue, aiming at national
reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded on a
balance of the interests of all Lebanese communities.''
   The 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon, a former French possession,
has pitted Christians against Moslems and Druse militias. Since the
latest outbreak of fighting in March, Druse forces and Syrian troops
in Lebanon have battled the Christian army of Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun
has demanded the withdrawal of the Syrians, in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate.
   The Soviet Union is the main arms supplier for Syria as well as
Iraq, which has been arming the Christian forces.
   The statement followed Gorbachev's meeting with French
intellectuals and students at the Sorbonne in which he challenged
them to help create a new, more peaceful world.
   Seated in a red velvet chair in the packed Sorbonne amphitheatre,
Gorbachev said the new Soviet political and economic system he is
fashioning would be ``a fusion of socialism and democracy.''
   ``It's more difficult than we thought at the beginning, but it's
working. The country is changing, rapidly and irriversibly,'' he
said, speaking through a translator to an audience of 2,000 that
included philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy and Regis Debray, a former
presidential adviser and author.
   Members of the Soviet delegation earlier this week said the visit
to the Sorbonne, the University of Paris founded in the 12th
century, would underline a new understanding between France and the
Soviet Union.
   For the last decade, French intellectuals, many of them former
leftists, have condemned communist totalitarian regimes since the
publication of Alexander Solzhenitsyn ``Gulag Archipelego.''
   Gorbachev called for protecting the global environment, halting
moral decline and for cooperation between ``men of culture, science
and art in France and the Soviet Union'' to solve the political and
social problems of the time.
   Gorbachev began the second day of his visit to France by laying a
wreath on the tomb of France's unknown soldier beneath the Arc de
Triomphe and paying a call on Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac.
   At a state dinner Tuesday, the first day of his three-day visit,
the Soviet president declared his readiness to defend human rights
and called for a united Europe, for moving beyond the East-West
schism that grew from the Cold War.
   ``The postwar period is over,'' Gorbachev said at the gala
dinner. ``Today, a way toward a stable peace is opening before us,
based not on a balance of forces, but on a balance of real and
correctly understood interests.''
   On Tuesday, the Soviet president met with Mitterrand and then
visited the Place de la Bastille, where 200 years ago this month an
angry mob stormed the prison and launched the French Revolution,
which swept away the French monarchy.
   In his dinner toast, Gorbachev said the Soviets feel like
participants in this month's festivities celebrating the French
Revolution's Bicentennial in part ``because perestroika, also, is a
revolution.''
   Perestroika, or restructuring, is the name given to Gorbachev's
4-year-old drive to revamp Soviet society and economy. In his
remarks, the 58-year-old leader noted that perestroika also includes
a keener understanding of the importance of human rights, long an
irritant in East-West relations.
   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, he has
repudiated the vast apparatus of state terror put in place by
dictator Josef Stalin.
   He has also allowed wider expression of dissenting views,
including public challenges to the monopoly on power held by the
ruling Communist Party.
   He told Mitterrand that, like France, the Soviet Union is now
ready to defend the rights of ``individuals and entire nations.''

   A federal judge today fined the United Mine
Workers and two union officers an additional $720,000 for violating
his ban on forming convoys to slow down trucks delivering coal.
   Also today, an explosion damaged a McClure warehouse owned by the
strikebound Pittston Coal Group, State Police said. No injuries were
reported.
   It was not clear whether whether the 2:30 a.m. blast was related
to the four-month strike against the company by 1,900 miners in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. Police said the explosion was
under investigation.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams on June 26 fined the UMW and
two officers $240,000 for organizing convoys of cars and trucks to
block coal traffic, and threatened fines of $120,000 for each day
the traffic jams continued.
   Williams said the union violated his order for six days with
bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads used by coal haulers. Most of
those in the convoys have been UMW members from other states on
sympathy wildcat strikes.
   State Police Special Agent Larry Waddell testified that troopers
wrote nearly 200 tickets for impeding traffic last week.
   ``Despite all the massive ticketing, it's all just sort of
whistling Dixie,'' the judge said. He raised the daily fine to
$550,000 for further violations.
   UMW attorney Mike Passino said the union will appeal the fines,
which now total $960,000. Jackie Stump, president of the union's
Virginia district, said the fines are excessive.
   On Tuesday, the union garnered support from United Farm Workers'
President Cesar Chavez.
   ``Your struggle is our struggle,'' Chavez told more than 5,000
striking miners and supporters at a rally. ``And your victory is our
victory and victory for every worker in this country.''
   Chavez said the UMW's commitment to non-violence during the
strike and the use of civil disobedience has captured the attention
of organized labor.
   ``People know about it in the workplace, even on the West
Coast,'' he said of the labor dispute that began April 5. The public
and all organized labor will be on the UMW's side as long as
non-violent tactics persist, Chavez said.
   Pittston miners had been working without a contract for 14 months
when they went on strike over wages, benefits and working
conditions. The walkout has spawned sympathy strikes by 37,000
miners in the Midwest and Appalachia.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said the company is feeling no
pressure to return to the bargaining table. The sympathy strikes in
have ``zero effect on us,'' Odom said. He added that Pittston
continues to operate with replacements.

<HEAD>Marcos Daughter: Inner Strength Keeping Former President Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos'
inner strength is keeping him alive, but his family knows the end
could come at any time, says Marcos' daughter.
   ``Daddy has the capacity to strengthen us all,'' Irene Araneta
said Tuesday. ``The mere fact that he hasn't given up, we all know
it's the only thing that is keeping him alive.''
   Marcos was in very critical condition Wednesday, on life-support
machines and battling a widespread infection at St. Francis Medical
Center. He has been hospitalized since January. Doctors performed
surgery last week to remove his failed transplanted kidney.
   Mrs. Araneta, 28, Marcos' youngest child, said her family has had
several scares in recent months, but each time her father has
battled back.
   ``Each time we try to take it better. I guess it is like a
rehearsal,'' said Mrs. Araneta, a music student. ``I'm a great
believer in rehearsals. What are we rehearsing for? Well, it has to
come.
   ``We are still hopeful, prayerful, that it won't happen here. But
nobody knows if he is going to last until tomorrow.''
   Marcos was ousted in a 1986 civilian-military revolt that brought
President Corazon Aquino to power.

   Oliver L. North today drew a three-year
suspended prison term and a $150,000 fine for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair. ``You're not the fall guy,'' the judge said in
sentencing the former White House aide.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell placed the former National
Security Council assistant on two years' probation and ordered him
to perform 1,200 hours of community service administering a new
program to help inner-city youth avoid involvement in drugs.
   Gesell cited North's distinguished career as a Marine officer
before he became a staff member at the White House during the Reagan
administration.
   He told North that during the Iran-Contra affair ``I don't think
you were a leader at all.'' He said North was ``really a low-ranking
subordinate who was carrying out the instructions of a few cynical
superiors.''
   North, who has said he will appeal his conviction on three
counts, had faced a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment and fines
totaling $750,000.
   In pre-sentencing remarks, North denied the prosecution's
contention that he lacked remorse, saying, ``I grieve for what has
happened and I truly regret it every day.''
   Speaking in a soft voice, North said he had served his country
for 20 years. ``I would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or
its institutions. I have made many mistakes. I have been convicted
of serious crimes,'' he said.
   Pronouncing sentence, Gesell told North:
   ``Along the way you came to accept the mistaken view that
Congress couldn't be trusted ... that the fate of the country could
be left to a small inside group not elected that was free to act as
they chose while publicly professing to act differently.''
   But Gesell said that even though North was following orders,
``you're not the fall guy for this tragic breach of the public
trust.''
   The judge told North that ``I believe you still lack a full
understanding of how the public service has been tarnished'' by his
activities. But Gesell added, ``Jail would only harden your
misconceptions.''
   Gesell also barred North from holding federal office.
   The Navy said it was suspending payment of North's $23,000 Marine
Corps pension immediately but was asking the congressional General
Accounting Office for legal authority to restore it.
   North, his lawyers, his minister and other members of his
entourage left the courthouse through a side door. He made no
comment to the crowd waiting outside.
   A group of supporters yelled, ``Pardon North now'' as North was
droven off in a van.
   John Keker, North's chief prosecutor, refused to speak with
reporters after the sentencing, driving away immediately.
   Keker's boss, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who had
sought a prison term for North, issued a terse statement saying:
``Sentencing is uniquely a matter for the judgment of the trial
judge. We had a full opportunity to present our views. We have no
further comment.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush had no comment on the sentencing, noting the case was headed
for an appeal. As for a presidential pardon for North, Fitzwater
said, ``We haven't discussed a pardon. There's been no discussion.
It hasn't ever been discussed.''
   Mark Weinberg, spokesman for former President Reagan, declined
comment on the sentence.
   Denise Anderson, forewoman of the jury that convicted North in
May, told CBS News: ``Yes, I think it was a fair sentence. As a
matter of fact, I'm so happy I can hardly talk. I've been praying
for this.''
   North and his attorney urged the judge to consider the suffering
the former presidential aide has already endured because of
extensive publicity surrounding the case and the continued threat of
assassination by a terrorist group led by Abu Nidal.
   ``I ask only that you consider these things when you weigh the
sentence,'' North said. Noting the disruption of his family's life,
North asked that ``you be lenient so that they may have a chance to
rebuild their lives.''
   North remained at the defense table for a few minutes after
Gesell concluded the sentencing. He then walked over to his wife,
Betsy, who was sitting in the front row, kissed her on the cheek and
whispered in her ear. The two then smiled broadly.
   The 45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel was found
guilty May 4 of aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress by
helping write a false chronology of a 1985 arms shipment to Iran. He
also was convicted of destroying sensitive government documents and
accepting a $13,800 home security system from arms dealer Richard V.
Secord.
   Gesell imposed a three-year suspended sentence on North for
aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress, placed him on two
years' probation and fined him $100,000.
   The judge gave North a two-year suspended sentence and a $35,000
fine for destroying or altering government documents. He also
imposed a one-year suspended sentence and a $15,000 fine for
accepting an illegal gratuity from Secord, whose Iran-Contra trial
is pending.
   In describing the community service he ordered, Gesell said he
hoped North would become ``conscious of certain values you and your
associates appear to have overlooked in the elite isolation of the
White House.''
   Gesell said the community service would take advantage of North's
considerable administrative and organizational skills. He directed
that North perform 800 hours on the project the first year and 400
during the second year of the probationary period.
   North testified at his trial that he had acted at the direction
of his superiors, including then-President Reagan. Defense attorney
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. argued against imprisoning his client.
   But independent counsel Walsh recommended a prison term for
North, arguing in court pleadings that the former National Security
Council aide lied at his trial and has shown no remorse for his
crimes.
   The defense team led by Sullivan said in court papers that the
prosecution's request for imprisonment ``demonstrates that it will
stop at nothing in its effort to crush Oliver North.''
   The defense said Walsh had not presented ``a shred of support''
to the accusation that North lied to win acquittal of a charge he
pocketed $4,300 in travelers' checks entrusted to him by Contra
leader Adolfo Calero.
   ``We urge the court to reject the (prosecutor's) efforts to
obtain a prison sentence by smearing Oliver North,'' the defense
said in a brief filed Monday.
   In its sentencing memo, the defense said that sending North to
prison would only encourage high government officials to let
subordinates take the blame for ``legally or politically risky''
ventures.
   The defense cited North's heroism as a platoon leader during the
Vietnam War and his efforts to free U.S. hostages when he worked at
the National Security Council. It urged Gesell to ``give this record
of service great weight in choosing the appropriate sentence for
Oliver North.
   ``A sentence of imprisonment would be cruel and unjust,'' the
defense said. ``Such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally
unfair.''
   North, during six days of testimony at his trial, said his
efforts secretly replaced those of the CIA when Congress barred the
agency from helping the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``I was not stepping in ... I was brought in ... Basically, it
was a handoff _ you've got the ball, now run with it,'' he testified.
   North admitted to jurors that he lied to Congress by denying he
was helping the Contras.
   ``I was raised to know the difference between right and wrong,''
North told the jury. ``I knew it wasn't right not to tell the truth
on those things, but I didn't think it was unlawful.''
   North was acquitted of nine other charges, including allegations
he lied to Congress by denying he was covertly helping the rebels.
   Following the verdict, North said he would ``fight _ and fight
hard _ for as long as it takes to prevail'' in the courts on appeal.
   Since his conviction, North has continued to appear on the
lecture circuit, reportedly being paid $25,000 an appearance.

   A man was killed when a fireworks
explosion sent pieces of a cinderblock through the air, and the man
who set off the blast was charged with manslaughter, police said
Wednesday.
   The fireworks were placed on the cinderblock Tuesday night, and
the explosion caused pieces of the block to fly in different
directions, Suffolk County Sgt. Edward Fandry said.
   One piece hit John Connelly, 20, piercing his chest. Connelly, of
Yaphank, was taken to John Mather Memorial Hospital in Port
Jefferson, where he died.
   On Wednesday, police arrested Jeffrey DeFranco, 28, of Mount
Sinai on a charge of second-degreee manslaughter.
   Four other people who were hit by flying cinderblock pieces were
treated at a hospital and released, police and hospital officials
said.

   The Louisiana Legislature, where
anti-abortion sentiment is overwhelming, went into special session
Wednesday, but abortion failed to make the agenda because of the
state's financial problems.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer refused to amend his instructions for the
six-day tax session to include abortion in light of Monday's U.S.
Supreme Court decision that allows states to place more restrictions
on abortions.
   He said there was too little time to deal with the subject but
said he wants legislative committees to look at possible revision of
the state's laws.
   In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez said Wednesday he will call a
special legislative session to consider legislation further
restricting abortions.
   Louisiana's anti-abortion forces are so strong that the state is
expected to be among the first to tackle new abortion legislation.
   Rep. Alphonse Jackson, a Democrat and a pro-choice leader,
predicted that anti-abortion forces will be able to pass anything
they want.
   ``There is no question that the pro-life forces are in charge of
this Legislature,'' Jackson said. ``They will prevail.''
   Louisiana has laws similar to the ones in Missouri that the
Supreme Court upheld on Monday, blocking the use of state money or
faciliites for abortions.
   Unlike Missouri's laws, however, the ones in Louisiana remained
in effect during the challenge in Washington, so no abortions were
performed at the state's charity hospitals or by state employees.
   Since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling legalizing
abortions, Louisiana has passed stacks of restrictive legislation,
but only one other law has stood the constitutional test. It
requires that parents be notified if their children try to obtain
abortions.
   Louisiana also passed a provision that all pre-1973 laws, making
abortions criminal, go back on the books if the Supreme Court ever
reverses Roe v. Wade.
   Jackson, chairman of the House committee that would hear abortion
bills, said the abortion issue cannot come up until the 1990 regular
session unless the governor calls another special session.
   ``There are no plans for that,'' said P.J. Mills, the governor's
chief of staff. ``He would do so if there was a public necessity.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded today under a tour bus carrying
sailors of the Soviet fishing fleet, injuring 20 of the fishermen
and damaging two other buses with Soviet visitors, police said.
   The explosion occurred when the fishermen were boarding the bus
after shopping in a Lima suburb, police and witnesses told radio
stations.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, but police
blamed the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas group, which has targeted
Soviet citizens and diplomats in the past.
   Gen. Oswaldo Diaz Salvador, Lima police chief, said two young men
carefully placed a package under the bus and then raced off as the
bomb exploded.
   Bomb experts said the explosion was caused by about 12 pounds of
dynamite. Two other buses with Soviet fishermen aboard were damaged
by the explosion, which occurred at 10 a.m., police said.
   Eight of the 20 sailors were seriously injured, police said.
Witnesses said the explosion maimed the sailors' legs and lower
bodies.
   Diaz Salvador said the bombed bus was carrying 49 people when the
attack occurred and 35 sailors were on two smaller buses. The buses
were owned by a tourism service.
   In 1986, a guerrilla was killed after breaking into the grounds
of the Soviet Embassy when the bomb he was carrying exploded.
   Also in 1986, several Soviet fishermen were injured when a bomb
went off in a store frequented by the sailors in the port city of
Callao.
   Lima is a resupply point for the Soviet fishing fleet operating
off the west coast of South America.
   The Shining Path views the Soviet government as traitors to true
Marxism and regards the Soviets as enemies because they have been a
major supplier of arms to Peru for the two decades. More than 15,000
people have been killed in Peru's nine-year guerrilla insurgency.

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday it was
deeply concerned about allegations that Namibia's guerrilla movement
tortured prisoners and said it had asked for an accounting from
neighboring African governments.
   Some of the 150 people freed after years of imprisonment said
many others were tortured and beaten to death while held in
underground pits in neighboring Angola. They said they were among
thousands of dissidents imprisoned by the South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) during its guerrilla war for independence from
South Africa.
   The State Department has been in the forefront of pushing for
independence for the territory. Elections are scheduled in November.
   Several freed prisoners estimated SWAPO still holds more than
2,000 detainees.
   Guerrilla leaders say they held just 201 dissidents and have
released them all. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugeees says it
accepts the SWAPO figures, although a relatives' committee in
Namibia has given U.N. officers the names of more than 300 missing
SWAPO members.
   Asked about the situation, Richard Boucher, a State Department
spokesman, said: ``We are deeply concerned about the allegations of
mistreatment of Namibians by SWAPO. We've asked for a full
accounting of the status of all detainees.''
   Boucher said two U.N. groups were investigating.
   ``We have raised the question of accounting for all SWAPO
detainees with several countries in the region and have asked them
to use their influence with SWAPO to ensure the safe repatriation of
all SWAPO detainees to Namibia,'' the U.S. official said.
   ``We again call upon the concerned parties and governments to
encourage SWAPO to make a full accounting of the detainees.''
   Boucher said the State Department was not dealing directly with
SWAPO, the major black nationalist group in Namibia and likely to
take control of the emerging nation.

   Heavy rains disrupted Amtrak passenger service
along the railroad's busy northeast corridor today, requiring busing
and long delays that affected nearly 10,000 passengers, a spokesman
said.
   Engineers opened a single track north of Wilmington, Del., in
early afternoon after all three tracks through the area were flooded
for several hours, said spokesman Cliff Black. The other tracks
would have to be repaired, he said.
   Trains were creeping through the area 1{ miles north of
Wilmington at 5 mph, and Metroliner express service between
Washington and New York was cancelled between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.,
Black said. The Metroliner normally runs every hour from both New
York and Washington, traveling through Philadelphia, Wilmington and
Baltimore.
   Service was being resumed with the 3 p.m. trains, but delays of
about a half-hour were expected through the rest of the day, Black
said.
   ``Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train
operations severly disrupted,'' the spokesman said shortly before
noon.
   Later, he said the rains had abated and the single track was
re-opened. Black said 20 trains were either delayed or canceled,
affecting 10,000 passengers.
   Special buses set up to carry passengers between Wilmington and
Philadelphia and between Wilmington and Baltimore also had
difficulty because of flooding on roads near the tracks, he said.
   The normally 25-minute trip between Wilmington and Philadelphia
was taking more than two hours, Black said.
   He said several trains have had to reverse direction and return
to the stations they left, including two in Baltimore, several in
Philadelphia and one at Wilmington.
   In some cases, a train was turned around and replaced for another
train that was supposed to go in the opposite direction, picking up
bused passengers, he said.
   There was no service between Philadelphia and Wilmington for
several hours, and trouble also spread south of Wilmington, he said.
   He said water covered all three tracks just north of Wilmington,
and trains carrying crushed stones were standing by to repair
roadbeds if necessary.

   No U.S. Marines guarding the residence of U.S. Ambassador Thomas
McNamara fired their weapons and no one at the embassy or residence
was hurt, said embassy spokesman Steven Gangstead.
   McNamara had left for Miami before the raid took place, an
immigration officer at the El Dorado International Airport told
Bogota radio station RCN. McNamara would not comment on the report.
   Soldiers had arrived in front of an apartment building a block
from the ambassador's residence to raid an apartment when someone on
the seventh floor began firing at the troops, according to a major
with the national police.
   The soldiers, armed with submachine guns, returned the fire, the
major told RCN. The major identified himself only by his last name,
Villamil.
   It was not known if the four people reported dead were in the
apartment being raided.
   Colombia is under a state of siege because of activity by leftist
guerrillas and drug traffickers. This gives the armed forces
authority to arrest civilians.

   Syrian gunners shelled Christian ports
Wednesday to try to prevent Iraqi-supplied arms from arriving, and
Syrian gunboats patrolled the coast to tighten a blockade.
   In Paris, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and French
President Francois Mitterrand appealed for an immediate cease-fire
and a cutoff of arms deliveries to the former French colony. The
Soviet Union is the main arms supplier for the Iraqis and Syrians.
   The newspaper An-Nahar said the Syrian blockade aims to force
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun to remove Soviet-made
medium-range missiles he reportedly obtained from Iraq that could
hit the Syrian capital Damascus.
   The newspaper, in an unattributed report, said Syria ``insists
that the Frog-7 missiles be removed from Lebanon.''
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, has declared support for Aoun's
``war of liberation'' against 40,000 Syrian troops in predominantly
Moslem territories of Lebanon. Rival Christian and Moslem
governments headed by Aoun and Salim Hoss have existed since
September.
   Police said land skirmishes around the Christian enclave quieted
Wednesday. On Tuesday, Syrian-allied Moslem forces reopened gateways
linking the enclave in east Beirut and north of the capital with the
rest of Lebanon, relaxing the four-month siege of 1 million
Christians.
   The police spokesman said only ``a few bursts of machine-gun
fire'' were reported along Beirut's dividing Green Line and the
mountain range southeast of the capital.
   Syrian artillery in Moslem west Beirut intermittently shelled the
Christian ports of Jounieh, Amsheet and Byblos to prevent Aoun from
receiving Iraqi-supplied war materiel. No casualties were reported.
   Police said two Syrian gunboats were cruising the Mediterranean
north of Beirut to search ships plying Christian waters.
   The Syrian navy's activity covered the 28-mile
Christian-controlled stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean
coast, a police spokesman said.
   He said Aoun ``has managed to receive tanks, missiles, howitzers
and a variety of other weapons and ammunition despite the daily
Syrian artillery shelling of his ports.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with standing
rules, said the Syrian navy ``intercepted and searched'' eight
freighters that sailed into and out of Christian ports since
Saturday.
   Aoun on Tuesday summoned ambassadors of the five permanent member
states of the U.N. Security Council and expressed concern over the
Syrian naval blockade of the 310-square-mile enclave.
   The 54-year-old Maronite general also sent messages to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Arab League
Secretary-General Chedli Klibi complaining that Syrian navy vessels
were ``intercepting commercial ships in Lebanese territorial
waters.''
   An-Nahar said Syria has informed a three-member Arab committeee
on Lebanon of its demand about removing the missiles from the
Christian enclave.
   Iraq was reported to have delivered six Soviet-designed Frog-7
missiles to the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia
alliance. But Aoun has repeatedly denied receiving such weapons.
   The Frog-7, which has a range of 43 miles and carries a warhead
of 1,210 pounds of high explosives, is capable of hitting the Syrian
capital of Damascus if fired from the Christian heartland.
   The leftist daily As-Safir said in an editorial: ``The missile
crisis threatens grave repercussions, not just in Lebanon, but in
the entire region.''
   Beirut airport, closed since March 12, was scheduled to reopen
Tuesday. But Aoun threatened to shell the airport, in Syrian-policed
west Beirut, in retaliation for the Syrian naval blockade.
   ``Aoun informed the Moslem side that the airport will be allowed
to operate only when the Syrians lift their naval blockade,'' the
police spokesman said. He did not elaborate.
   The present confrontation broke out March 8, two days after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut that he said were depriving the government of $100 million in
customs dues annually.
   The Syrians retaliated by besieging the Christian enclave.
   In a joint statement after two days of talks, Gorbachev and
Mitterrand called for an immediate cease-fire and supported Arab
League mediation. They said their countries are available to help
with other efforts ``notably in the framework of the United Nations
Security Council.''
   The statement said Gorbachev and Mitterrand ``are convinced that
Lebanon must remain a sovereign, independent, united, with its
territorial integrity respected.''

   A teacher needs a strong voice to control a
classroom and Margaret Halverson must have been one of the best _
she's won the $150 first prize in the 15th annual Jackpot Hollerin'
Contest.
   It may be a hereditary ability. The retired teacher's son was
second.
   Mrs. Halverson, 64, of Lake City, Iowa, regained the title she
lost in 1984 by yelling: ``Hilda Martin had a baby! It's a Boooooy!''
   She beat out four others who made their way to Tuesday's contest
in the Idaho border town, 110 miles northeast of Elko. A three-judge
panel rated the contestants on volume, message, style and breath
control.
   Mrs. Halverson got her start in the 1960s when she became the
first woman to enter the Iowa State Hog-Calling Contest at the state
fair and beat out 25 men for top prize.
   ``I did what everybody else did, but a little louder and I won,''
she explained.
   Second-place finisher Tuesday was her son, George, from
Scotsdale, Ariz., who hollered a cattle call.
   Third was Louis Fontaine, a former member of Paul Revere and the
Raiders.
   In pioneer times, when it could take a day to travel 20 miles
between towns, lusty-throated hollerers would stand on mountaintops
and shout the news in relays.

   Speed is not the only way to win at
the annual ``Do It If You Dare Cardboard Boat Race'' _ the coveted
Titanic award goes to the boat that sinks in the most spectacular
fashion.
   The race, sponsored by the Heber Springs Chamber of Commerce, is
July 22 on Greers Ferry Lake. Last year it attracted about 50
entries.
   ``Though skeptics say cardboard and water don't mix, my mother
always told me that a good idea would float,'' said Pat Zellmer,
chairman of the event. ``Some real incredible boats have been made
by people who simply had good imaginations.''
   Zellmer said Richard Archer, a Southern Illinois University
professor, dreamed up the idea of cardboard racing several years ago
to encourage his students to be creative.
   Zellmer said the rules are simple _ boats must be built of
corrugated cardboard. Hulls may be waterproofed with any paintable
one-part substance. Seams and joints may be taped. Boats can be
propelled by paddles and paddlewheels; props and rudders also are
permitted.
   Engineers will be on hand to make sure no illegal parts are used.

   Black Mist is just a pony, but her owners say
she is a bit of history.
   Her mother, Misty II, is a granddaughter of Misty, a wild
Assateague Island pony immortalized in Marguerite Henry's 1947
children's book ``Misty of Chincoteague.''
   That book and its sequel, ``Stormy, Misty's Foal,'' concern the
wild horses on Assateague and Chincoteague islands off the coast of
Maryland.
   Misty II, now 15, gave birth June 17 to her fifth foat, Black
Mist, at Keith and Kendy Allen's farm near Manheim in Lancaster
County.
   The Allens say Misty II and her new foal will never leave their
farm.
   Mrs. Allen said she takes Misty II to area elementary schools,
and said she gets mail addressed to ``Misty II, R.D. 4, Manheim.''
   Black Mist could not be named Misty III because she doesn't carry
the original Misty's distinctive marking, a spot shaped like a map
of the United States on one flank.
   The original Misty died in 1972.
   The Allens have vowed to carry on the Misty line.
   Black Mist's sire is a 34-year-old Chincoteague pony named Rebel.
   ``We called his owners that morning and they and some of their
friends had a celebration,'' she said. ``They made his favorite food
_ blueberry pancakes _ in honor of the baby.''

<HEAD>$12 Million Paid Out in Agent Orange Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About $12 million has been paid out to Vietnam
veterans poisoned by Agent Orange since the U.S. Supreme Court
cleared the way for the program last year, according to a report
issued Wednesday.
   During the next year an additional $50 million to $60 million
will likely be handed out, said the report.
   As of June 30, more than 6,000 Vietnam veterans or their
survivors in every state had received a cash payment from the Agent
Orange Veteran Payment Program, established to distribute funds to
disabled veterans and their survivors. The program is required to
prepare an annual report on the distribution of funds, and the
report released Wednesday was the first.
   Disabled veterans received their first installments, with
payments ranging from $250 to $2,000, said Deborah Greenspan, an
attorney for the overseer of the fund. She said the veterans would
receive the payments annually for ``several years,'' but couldn't be
more specific. She said families of deceased veterans received a
single payment, generally about $3,400.
   Another 8,000 individuals _ including 4,000 children _ will
receive services funded by grants from the program.
   Under the program administered by U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein of federal District Court in New York, nearly $300 million
is to be distributed before Dec. 31, 1994.
   The Agent Orange Settlement Fund was created in 1984 when seven
chemical companies agreed to pay $180 million to settle a
class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam veterans and their families
who alleged injuries caused by Agent Orange, a defoliant the United
States used widely in the Vietnam War.
   The Supreme Court declined to hear appeals in the case in 1988,
clearing the way for distribution.
   Thus far, nearly 33,000 individuals have applied to receive money
from the program.

   President Bush refused to comment Wednesday on
the sentencing of former National Security Council aide Oliver
North, and the White House said the possibility of granting him a
pardon had not been discussed.
   Bush learned of the sentencing shortly after North had received a
three-year suspended prison term and a $150,000 fine for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he informed
Bush about North's sentence at the end of a meeting in the Oval
Office.
   ``He didn't have any comment,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush, who returned to the White House after a five-day stay at
his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spent the day at the
White House in meetings with aides. He also had his weekly luncheon
with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   During the day, Bush made no appearances where reporters could
ask him about North.
   Fitzwater said the White House would not comment on the
sentencing. ``We don't think it's appropriate,'' he said, noting
later that North had the right to appeal his conviction.
   Pressed on why there was no comment, Fitzwater said, ``That's
coming from the president. ... I know his thoughts on this matter.
   As for a presidential pardon for North, Fitzwater said, ``We
haven't discussed a pardon. There's been no discussion. It hasn't
ever been discussed.''

<HEAD>Oil Slick Off The Coast? Environmental Experts Like This One</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tanker spilled tons of thick crude oil
into the ocean off Norway, and environmental experts liked what they
saw.
   U.S and Norwegian scientists dumped 9,200 gallons of oil into the
North Sea from the tanker Esso Bergen over the weekend. The object
was to study the slick so that cleanup techniques could be improved.
   Researchers who tracked the oil as it spread over six miles
judged the experiment ``a great success.''
   The U.S. Department of Interior paid much of the project's
$600,000 pricetag. Private companies and the Norwegian government
also backed the experiment.
   It was conducted off western Norway because the United States
virtually never allows such experiments to take place, said ocean
engineer Mark Reed.
   Norway permitted the oil to befoul its waters so scientists could
study special buoys for tracking spills and ways to combat oil
pollution. It has permitted smaller spills in the past for cleanup
training.
   Researchers collected 500 samples of the slick, tried chemicals
for breaking down crude oil, trailed the floating oil from aircraft,
and studied its effect on fish and birds, Reed said by radio from
Norwegian research ship Endre Dyroey.
   ``In Norway, we realize that the only way to learn how to prevent
damage from an oil spill is to conduct experiments on a real one,''
said Roar Bjerknes, of the Trondheim marine technology company
Oceannor.
   ``One American scientist told me it was great to be able to come
to Norway and be allowed to create an oil slick,'' said Bjerknes,
whose company led the test.
   The Americans took a keen interest due to a series of spills of
the U.S. coast, including this spring's Valdez, Alaska accident.
   Permission to dump oil of Norway's coast was not granted lightly
by this nation noted for strict environmental rules.
   Morten Hauge, of Norway's Pollution Control Board, said this
record research spill was allowed only after public hearings and
risk analyses. He said cleanup equipment stood by in case the slick
got out of hand.
   ``The oil was spilled 70 miles from land and was too far out to
sea for there to be any risk of it reaching the coast,'' he said.
   The four-day experiment tested about 40 U.S. and Norwegian
electronic buoys designed to track slicks and beam information to a
computer via satellite, said Reed, an engineer with the Applied
Sciences Associates, based in Rhode Island.
   ``The main contract was from the Interior Department to test
three types of surface drifting buoy that send signals via the Argos
Satellite system,'' said Reed, who helped develop the system.
   The test was a day shorter than planned because natural forces of
the ocean broke down the slick faster than expected, said Reed.
   ``It seems to have been a great success ... We will look at the
data and relate it to the way the slick drifted so we can tell where
an oil slick is headed during a real accident,'' he said.
   Bjerknes said chemists from the Norwegian Continental Shelf
Institute and biolgists form the Directorate for Natural Resource
Management checked the effect of the slick on sea water and life as
it drifted for 40 miles before breaking up.
   Norway's pollution board tested its new pollution spotting
airplane and calibrated its data against that gathered by a similar
aircraft from the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works.
   Norwegian environmental experts sent to Alaska after the recent
catastrophic oil spill in which officials were critical of delays in
the cleanup effort.
   ``I think the U.S. has realized that they made a lot of
mistakes,'' Bjerknes said. The Americans are ``making a real effort
to no longer be the third world country of oil spill cleanups,'' he
said.

   If you guessed there were 2,335 names dropped in
``The Andy Warhol Diaries,'' you were close.
   The actual count is 2,338, according to Fame magazine, which
announced Wednesday it has compiled the first complete index to the
diaries and will publish same in its September issue.
   Until now, there has been no substitute for reading the entire
807-page book to find whether one's name was mentioned in Warhol's
diary of his social encounters from 1976 to 1987.
   ``With all that Andy had to say about so many people ... the one
thing that was clearly missing from the book was a complete and
comprehensive index,'' Fame editor-in-chief Gael Love said.
   Many of the names in the book were dropped dozens of times, Fame
found.
   Bianca Jagger got 84 mentions, the designer Halston 98 and artist
Jean-Michel Basqiuat topped that with 111. On the other end of the
scale, Yogi Berra, Idi Amin and Dick Tracy rated one mention apiece.
   The index will have the same page size as the book and will be
detachable so it can be inserted in the book, the announcement said.
``Diaries'' was No. 10 on the non-fiction best seller list in the
latest New York Times Book Review.

   Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or
cancelled Wednesday, with passengers put on buses as heavy rain
covered tracks along sections of the railroad's heavily traveled
Northeast corridor.
   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were
affected by the flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington,
Del., with six inches of water and debris. One of three lines was
reopened Wednesday afternoon, but repair crews were working to build
up the damaged roadbed on the other two.
   Trains were creeping through the area at 5 mph, said Black,
delaying by about 30 minutes service on regular trains and the
Metroliner express between New York City and Washington.
   Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
EDT were cancelled, Black said. The train normally runs ever hour
from both New York and Washington, with regular trains on the half
hour.
   ``Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train
operations severly disrupted,'' Black said shortly before noon.
Later, he said the rains had abated and full service was being
resumed, but with delays still anticipated through the rest of the
day.
   The rains came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison,
which dumped rain on the South for more than a week. Heavy rains
battered the Maryland-Delaware area and Philadelphia early
Wednesday. The city got 5.5 inches of rain in two hours.
   Black said rainfall in the Wilmington area was about 6 inches in
two hours.
   Special buses set up to carry Amtrak passengers between
Wilmington and Philadelphia and earlier between Wilmington and
Baltimore were having difficulty because of flooding on roads near
the tracks, he said.
   The normally 25-minute trip between Wilmington and Philadelphia
was taking more than two hours, Black said.
   He said several trains had to reverse direction and return to the
stations they left, including two in Baltimore, several in
Philadelphia and one at Wilmington.

   Chinese legislators on Wednesday said that ousted
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang tried to enlist the congress in
his fight against hard-line leaders who crushed student
pro-democracy protests.
   Delegates to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress also condemned one of their number for supporting Zhao's
effort.
   The legislators' speeches, made in a closed meeting but carried
by the official Xinhua News Agency, gave the first details of Zhao's
failed power struggle against hardliners led by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping. Party officials who ousted Zhao on June 24 said only that
he ``made the mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting the
party.''
   One congress delegate also lashed out at the U.S. Congress for
voting for trade and aid sanctions against China following the
army's June 3-4 attack on the protesters in which hundreds and
possibly thousands of people died.
   ``It is a violation of the international law as well as a slander
and attack on the Chinese people and Chinese government,'' Xinhua
quoted Fu Hao, a delegate from northwestern China's Shaanxi
province, as saying.
   It quoted another delegate, Song Rufen of Sichuan province, as
saying that after Premier Li Peng declared martial law May 20 to end
the student protests, ``people from Zhao's think tank came out from
behind the scenes and advocated `opposing martial law' and `down
with the puppet government.'
   ``They also demanded ... a special session of the National
People's Congress,'' Song said. ``The very next day, Zhao Ziyang
also suggested that an emergency meeting of the (congress) Standing
Committee be held.''
   Song and several other delegates accused fellow legislator Hu
Jiwei of supporting Zhao. Hu enlisted the help of a research
institute run by China's first private high-technology company, the
Stone Corp., in collecting legislators' signatures on a petition for
an emergency congress session.
   Hu said he collected 38 signatures, but fellow legislators
accused Stone of signing some names of people who did not support
the petition.
   ``Some people with ulterior motive manipulated behind the scenes
to achieve their own secret political goals,'' Beijing Radio quoted
legislator Zhang Chengxian as saying at Wednesday's session.
``Comrade Hu must bear responsibility for this.''
   A warrant reportedly has been issued for the head of Stone, Wan
Runnan, but sources in Hong Kong say he has fled China.
   The congress Standing Committee, a smaller body that acts for the
nearly 2,000-member congress between its annual sessions, began a
special session last week, but has expressed support for the
crackdown on the protesters. Like Zhao, many students had hoped the
congress would meet before the hardliners consolidated their
position and would challenge martial law.
   Several legislators did call for some of the political reforms
demanded by the students, including strengthening of China's new and
incomplete legal system.
   Xinhua quoted Tibetan delegate Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, a longtime
supporter of the communist government, as saying that China had a
good constitution and laws but did not implement them well,
resulting in corruption.
   Other delegates called for quicker action in drafting laws. China
began establishing a body of civil law only in the late 1970s and
many areas remain uncovered.
   Local and provincial governments announced new efforts to combat
official corruption, another demand of the students. It remained to
be seen how thoroughly the reform moves would be carried out or
whether they were efforts to placate an increasingly dissatisfied
public.
   The People's Daily newspaper said officials had cracked the
biggest corruption case in Beijing during 40 years of communist
rule, arresting six people for allegedly defrauding a government
research institute of $105,000.
   Also on Wednesday, hotel officials said the government has
ordered major joint-venture hotels in the capital to unhook their
satellite dishes which receive foreign news broadcasts, including
Cable News Network. China is engaged in an intensive propaganda
campaign to discredit Western news accounts of the crackdown on the
seven-week pro-democracy movement.
   The Japanese Embassy said that soldiers stopped and boarded three
buses carrying a Japanese youth delegation and confiscated film they
shot of soldiers guarding central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
Tiananmen was the center of the student protest movement.
   ``It was not a big deal,'' said embassy official Hideo Tarumi.
   The youths had just arrived in Beijing from North Korea, where
they took part in an international youth festival.

   In his first public show of remorse, a
convicted killer told a judge Wednesday he was sorry for the 1987
shooting rampage that killed six people and wounded 10 at two Palm
Bay shopping plazas.
   ``I'm sorry that all this happened,'' William Bryan Cruse sobbed.
   ``Anything else?'' prompted Circuit Judge John Antoon, who had
said he wanted to hear from Cruse before drafting a sentencing order.
   ``That's all that I can say,'' Cruse added as he choked back
tears.
   The brief exchange came at the end of a 3{-hour hearing at which
lawyers for both sides argued for and against imposition of the
death penalty, which was recommended by the jury that convicted
Cruse.
   The alternative is a sentence of life in prison without parole
for at least 25 years. Formal sentencing for the 61-year-old former
librarian is July 28.
   ``The judge is being supercautious in this case of mass murder,''
said State Attorney Norm Wolfinger. ``He is protecting the record,
getting everything down ... and frankly asking for assistance in
writing his order.''
   Cruse was convicted April 5 of 32 counts of murder, attempted
murder and kidnapping.
   Cruse sat quietly at the defense table. He has been held in the
Brevard County Jail since the morning after the rampage on April 23,
1987.
   His temporary insanity defense was rejected by the jury but he
has been diagnosed as mentally ill. While this in itself is not a
trial defense under Florida law, Cruse lawyers argue it should be a
major factor in deciding whether he should be executed or imprisoned.
   But chief trial prosecutor Chris White argued the ``net result of
his mental illness'' was limited to his belief that other people
considered him a homosexual.
   ``He appreciated what he was doing, the consequences of what he
was doing and that it was wrong,'' White said in summing up the
state's arguments that Cruse should be electrocuted.
   The shootings were part of a cold, calculating, premeditated
plan, and were carried out in heinous, atrocious and cruel fashion,
White said.
   Assistant Public Defender Marlene Alva said there was ``evidence
that he suffered from a mental illness, and part of that was the
belief that people were out to malign him ... that he felt morally
justified because of his twisted and psychotic mind.''
   She argued that Cruse's actions were the result of a boiling-over
of pent-up resentments and emotions rather than ``a master plan
against Palm Bay.''
   Cruse bought guns and ammunition but did not know his victims,
Ms. Alva noted.
   And, she added, shooting people is not heinous, atrocious and
cruel under the law.
   ``The state is asking the court to find that these victims
suffered great pain ... there is no evidence of that,'' she said.

   Hundreds of Soviets lined up Wednesday under gray
skies to pay their last respects to Andrei A. Gromyko, the voice of
Soviet foreign policy from Stalin to Gorbachev.
   The line to view Gromyko's flower-adorned open casket stretched
several blocks from the turquoise-colored Central Soviet Army House
in north Moscow. A black-and-white portrait of Gromyko, featuring
the dour face that earned him the nickname ``Grim Grom,'' hung at
the entrance.
   ``He represented old times,'' said navy officer Andrei N.
Pochtarev as he waited on a sidewalk. ``Now we must have a new
approach. Times have changed.''
   Because Gromyko was retired, there was no ceremony in Red Square
and his funeral was low key. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in
Paris on a state visit, as was Gromyko's successor, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   Only six of the 12 full members of the ruling Politburo went to
the viewing and one attended the burial service later at Moscow's
prestigious Novodevichy Cemetery.
   Gromyko lay in coffin on a bier at the center of the army
building's Red Banner Hall. Twenty-nine medals he received during
his long career were displayed on red cushions sloping to the floor
from the casket. Among the awards were Hero of Socialist Labor and
the country's highest civilian honor, the Order of Lenin, which he
received six times.
   Red carnations lay on the coffin and a mountain of flowers and
wreaths swelled up from the floor. A dozen soldiers stood guard, and
a band played somber music.
   Senior diplomats from embassies in Moscow traveled to the army
building to join Soviets in bidding farewell. U.S. Ambassador Jack
Matlock stood for a minute in front of the coffin before moving on
to express his sympathies to Gromyko's widow, Lydia; son, Anatoly;
and daughter, Emilia.
   At Novodevichy, there were only brief remarks by a Moscow city
official, a farm machinery builder, First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander A. Bessmertnykh and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a Politburo
member and premier of the Russian federation. Also present was
Alexandra P. Biryukova, a candidate Politburo member.
   ``His name is connected with the huge successes of Soviet foreign
policy, directed at the relaxation of international tension and
consolidation of world peace,'' Vorotnikov told about 300 mourners
at the cemetery, the second most prestigious burial ground after Red
Square. Many of the Soviet elite are buried at Novodevichy,
including Nikita S. Khrushchev, Nikolai A. Bulganin, Vyacheslav M.
Molotov and Anastas I. Mikoyan.
   Bessmertnykh, a Gromyko protege and specialist on U.S.-Soviet
relations, credited Gromyko with helping conclude important arms
control agreements with the West.
   ``They were achieved thanks in large measure to the deep
political shrewdness, creative approach and persistence of the
Soviet foreign minister,'' Bessmertnykh told the mourners.
   As a light rain fell, a military honor guard fired a salute to
Gromyko. Workers shoveled soil onto his red and black coffin.
   Anatoly Gromyko, who heads a Kremlin think tank on African
affairs, shook his head solemnly as he held the hand of his weeping
mother.
   Gromyko, who died Sunday at the age of 79, was a fixture in world
diplomacy since the time of Josef Stalin. He helped forge the
Alliance that defeated Nazi Germany and the Axis in World War II,
joined in founding the United Nations and participated in superpower
talks. Some Soviets have said Gromyko shared the blame for foreign
policy mistakes, such as the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   He was foreign minister for 28 years, was a member of the
Politburo and served as president _ a ceremonial post until
Gorbachev gave it new significance and took it for himself in
October.
   Gorbachev gradually eased Gromyko out of power as Soviet foreign
policy took a less confrontational approach. In April, Gromyko lost
his last post: membership on the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Gorbachev gave a sober assessment of Gromyko's career Monday,
saying it reflected ``our achievements, our problems.''
   The cause of Gromyko's death was not announced but a Soviet
source said Wednesday he had been hospitalized for three weeks and
died of a burst aorta, the body's major artery. He had been
diagnosed as having circulatory problems five years ago, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   While her husband took care of official business
Wednesday, Raisa Gorbachev visited the newly renovated Louvre and
admired the striking bronze and marble sculptures at the Rodin
Museum.
   Applauding tourists welcomed the Soviet first lady at both spots,
and she stopped several times to shake hands with with admirers.
   The museum visits were Mrs. Gorbachev's only public appearances
Wednesday apart from her husband of 36 years, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   They are staying in a palace for foreign heads of state near the
expensive stores of the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, but Mrs.
Gorbachev has made no shopping forays, perhaps to avoid criticism at
home for extravagance.
   Her lifestyle is resented by many Soviet citizens who must cope
with shortages that make basic goods like soap and matches difficult
to find. A member of the new Soviet legislature even likened Mrs.
Gorbachev to Napoleon's wife and claimed her influence would doom
her husband.
   During their last visit to Paris, soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985, Mrs. Gorbachev enjoyed a parade of minks,
satins and other luxury clothes at the fashion house of Pierre
Cardin and sipped champagne at the Closerie des Lilas, a writers'
haunt on the Left Bank.
   On her tour Wednesday, she was accompanied by Danielle
Mitterrand, wife of President Francois Mitterrand.
   Mrs. Gorbachev entered the Louvre under the 70-foot-high glass
pyramid, passing hundreds of waiting visitors lined up in the
Napoleon courtyard.
   The pyramid, centerpiece of the $850 million renovation, tops
three underground levels containing a vast main hall, library,
information desks, galleries and storage space.
   With Culture Minister Jack Lang as her guide, she toured the
vestiges of the first Louvre castle built by King Philippe Auguste
in 1200 as a military stronghold to protect Paris from English
invaders.
   On the specially built wooden walkways in soft yellow light, she
looked at the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep
and turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it.
   ``It is fascinating to find oneself all of a sudden in the center
of Paris transported back to the 12th century,'' Mrs. Gorbachev
said. ``I am happy to have the chance to see all these beautiful
things and get to know more about French culture.''
   She did not get to see the museum's three main attractions _ the
Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace _ but did
receive a silk scarf as a gift from the museum staff and presented
two Soviet art books to Curator Michel Laclotte.
   Then her motorcade was off to the Left Bank and the works of
Auguste Rodin, and a disappointment. The sculpture she most wanted
to see, ``Sleep,'' is on exhibit in New York.
   ``Too bad,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said. ``I guess I'll have to come
back.''
   She told Curator Jacques Vilain she had visited the museum once
before, but did not say when and Soviet officials did not know.
   After looking at ``The Hand of God,'' ``The Cathedral,'' ``The
Kiss'' and several other works, she ended her tour in the garden,
before the sculpture of ``The Thinker.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev called her visit to the museum ``an unforgettable
souvenir of Paris.''

   A man who told a store clerk he had had a bad
day pulled a .357-caliber Magnum handgun and stole a single bottle
of beer, police said.
   Police later arrested a man who handed over a gun but drank the
rest of the evidence as officers approached.
   A man took a 16-ounce bottle of beer to the counter of a
convenience store Tuesday night, said Sgt. John Bowman.
   ``He said, `Let me have this. I've had a bad day,''' Bowman said.
``The attendant said he couldn't do that.''
   Bowman said the man then pulled the gun and pointed it at the
clerk.
   ``He said, `This is all I want. I don't want anything else' and
walked out the door while continuing to hold the gun on the
attendant,'' Bowman said.
   Officers later saw a man fitting the robber's description at a
parking lot. Bowman said the officers approached the man and ordered
him to drop the gun and the beer.
   ``He complied with half of the order and drank the rest of his
beer,'' Bowman said.
   Police jailed a 33-year-old Tulsa man pending the filing of
formal charges.

   The youth department of a predominantly black
pentecostal group said Wednesday its primary effort into the next
century is to fight drugs, and it urged other churches to help.
   ``The church must speak out loud and clear and more
effectively,'' Bishop Charles Brewer told members of the Church of
God in Christ, which claims 3 million members in the United States
and 1.5 million in 44 other countries.
   The drug program was disclosed at the 14th annual convention of
the church's United National Auxiliaries. More than 12,000 people
are participating in various meetings and activities through
Saturday.
   ``We hope to make an impact across the country'' with drug
programs, said Brewer, of New Haven, Conn., chairman of the youth
department.
   Bishop Floyd Perry of Cleveland, chairman of the convention, said
``the church is the answer in the battle against drugs and crime,
and it all starts in the schools.''
   ``When those who are addicted leave treatment centers they often
go back to drugs, and we have to change that, we have to stop
that,'' Perry said. ``Treatment is the BandAid, it only patches up
the problem, but the churches must do the healing. We have to reach
out to our youth to help change man's lives.
   ``We also need to change the image of the black community as
being drug-oriented. Our 6,000 churches are going to send a message
out about drugs that the real permanent answer is spiritual faith,
and we intend to cross denominational lines with that message. The
church has to change the content of the heart.''
   A federal drug official told more than 250 youth delegates that
``the church has to open its doors to work with the addicted and the
afflicted.''
   ``Drug addiction is not only a social problem, it is a spiritual
problem,'' said N. John Wilde, Drug Enforcement Administration agent
in charge of enforcement in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and
the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Justices Will Use Arkansas Case to Rule on State Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court will use the case of a
convicted Arkansas mass murderer who says he is ready to die to
decide whether state appeals courts must review all death sentences.
   The court has agreed to review an appeal in behalf of R. Gene
Simmons, sentenced to die for killing 16 relatives and acquaintances
in 1987.
   The justices took the action Monday in the wind-up to their
current term, but the announcement went largely unnoticed as the
court ruled in a key abortion dispute and also decided an important
church-state controversy.
   The court will hear arguments in the Simmons case in its next
term, which begins in October. A ruling is likely in 1990.
   Simmons has said he wants his death sentence carried out.
   ``I only ask for what I deserve. Let the torture and suffering
end. Please allow me the right to be at peace,'' he said.
   After a judge determined Simmons was mentally competent to waive
his right to appeal, the Rev. Louis Franz asked the Arkansas Supreme
Court to block the execution.
   The state Supreme Court said Franz, who ministers to Arkansas
death row inmates, lacked legal standing to make the appeal in
Simmons' behalf.
   The state court also said Simmons ``understands the choice of
life and death and has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his
right to appeal.''
   Three days before Simmons was to be executed last March 16,
another Arkansas death row inmate, Jonas H. Whitmore, asked the
state court to spare Simmons. The request was denied.
   On the eve of Simmons' scheduled execution, the U.S. Supreme
Court granted Whitmore's emergency request to spare Simmons in order
to give the high court time to decide whether it would review the
case.
   In his appeal to the high court acted on Monday, Whitmore said
the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment requires a
state appellate court to review all capital cases, even when the
defendant has asked to die.
   Lawyers for Whitmore said Arkansas is alone among the 37 states
with the death penalty in not requiring mandatory appellate review.
   If the justices rule for Whitmore, Arkansas will have to join the
other states. If he loses, other states would be free to abandon
mandatory appellate review.
   Whitmore's lawyers noted that Utah added a requirement for such
review after Gary Gilmore was executed in 1977. Gilmore, who did not
challenge his death sentence, was the first person executed in the
United States since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment
in 1976.
   Lawyers representing Simmons asked the high court to reject
Whitmore's appeal.
   ``With all due respect, .... society demands that capital
punishment be enforced fairly and expeditiously or ... be abolished
in its entirety,'' they said.
   Among Simmons' victims were Kathy Kendrick, 24, who was shot to
death at a Russellville, Ark., law office on Dec. 28, 1987.
   Police said she had spurned Simmons' advances more than a year
earlier when both worked at a motor freight office.
   In what prosecutors called a murderous rampage through the
college town of Russellville, Simmons shot four others on Dec. 28,
one fatally.
   After arresting Simmons, police went to his home in nearby Dover
and found the bodies of Simmons' wife, their three sons, four
daughters, a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law and four grandchildren.
   Seven of the bodies were found in a shallow grave near the house,
two in plastic bags in the trunks of abandoned cars and five in the
house.
   The case is Whitmore vs. Arkansas, 88-7146.

<HEAD>Government Imposes Censorship on Local Journalists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka on Wednesday banned local
journalists from writing anti-government articles, and an official
linked the order to newspaper reports predicting a military takeover.
   The censorship rules will not apply to foreign correspondents,
according to a Department of Information statement that gave few
details, other than to say President Ranasinghe Premadasa has
appointed four government officials as censors.
   A senior government official linked the censorship to reports on
an ongoing transport workers' strike believed instigated by
Sinhalese extremists.
   The decision was taken, he said, after ``several anti-government
reports appeared in newspapers saying the transport strike had
crippled the government and that a military takeover was on the
cards.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
censors will stop publication mainly of articles about the strike,
about violence by Sinhalese extremists and current peace
negotiations between the government and separatist Tamil rebels.
   He did not name offending newspapers, but at least one Sinhala
language daily, The Dinerasea, has severely criticized the
government's handling of the strike and peace negotiations. It is
published by the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   Journalists last were censored in July 1983 when ethnic violence
between the Buddhist Sinhalese and mostly Hindu Tamils claimed
hundreds of lives.
   The strike for higher wages by about 50,000 workers of
state-owned transport services has spread among other workers and is
paralyzing the island nation.
   Two weeks ago, Premadasa imposed a nationwide state of emergency
to crush the strike, which his government blames on ultranationalist
Sinhalese.
   The government also blames the extremists, from the left-wing
People's Liberation Front, for assassinations of 3,500 government
workers and ruling party officials and supporters in a two-year
campaign to protest peace overtures to the minority Tamils who
dominate the northeast.
   The biggest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, last week agreed to a cease-fire and peace talks.
   This week, the government postponed until Jan. 29 a referendum on
whether the northern and eastern provinces should merge.
   It was scheduled for Wednesday in Eastern Province, which has
many ethnic groups. Tamils say both provinces form the traditional
Tamil homeland.
   The postponement was requested by the Tamil Tigers and the Tamil
group that has run the provincial government since it accepted
limited autonomy in exchange for ending the rebellion. The Tamil
Tigers still want an independent homeland.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against them.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the six-year war.

   A Marine standing guard in a nuclear

according to officials at Cecil Field Naval Air Station.
   The second guard was treated for shock and remained hospitalized
Wednesday.
   The shooting occurred Tuesday afternoon at the Yellow Water
Weapons Storage Area where 140 nuclear missiles are believed to be
stored. The Navy refuses to comment on the location of nuclear
weapons.
   ``Preliminary information ... is that one shot was fired,'' said
Bert Byers, a spokesman for Cecil Field. The weapon used was a 9mm
pistol, the weapon commonly issued to the base's Marine security
staff.
   Detectives from the Naval Investigative Service were treating the
shooting as an accident, Byers said.
   Navy officials refused to discuss how many guards were on duty in
the area, citing security concerns. The names of the men were
withheld until their families could be notified.

   A judge ordered a Jewish seminarian to remain in
custody Wednesday on charges he shot and wounded two Palestinian
workers near Tel Aviv, and police said he may have been involved in
several raids on Arab villages.
   In the West Bank, Palestinians killed a fellow Arab suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, and a 20-year-old
Palestinian died of bullet wounds suffered in a clash with Israeli
soldiers.
   Seven Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, Arab reports said.
   The deaths raised to at least 543 the number of Palestinians
killed in the nearly 19-month uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-three Israelis also have
died in the violence.
   Judge Chaim Eilat, of the Tel Aviv Magistrate Court, ordered
seminary student Rafi Solomon held for 10 days. Solomon, 23, studies
at Joseph's Tomb seminary in the town of Nablus in the occupied West
Bank. The court earlier suppressed publication of his name.
   He was taken into custody June 20 after he allegedly shot and
wounded two Palestinian workers who were waiting for rides on the
outskirts of Tel Aviv. Witnesses said he was wearing a checkered
Arab scarf to try to hide his identity.
   The attack on the workers occurred shortly after an emotional
funeral for a U.S.-born settler, Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, killed
by Arab shepherds as he hiked alone on the West Bank.
   Police told the court that at the time of the shooting, Solomon
was free on bail after he and seven other seminary students were
detained in connection with a raid on the West Bank village of Kifl
Harith. A 13-year-old Palestinian girl was fatally shot in the raid
May 29.
   In requesting that Solomon be held in custody for 10 more days,
police also said he may have been involved in other raids on Arab
villages, but they gave no details.
   Doctors in the West Bank town of Nablus said that Khaled Hamadi,
20, of the village of Beit Leit died Wednesday of gunshot wounds
suffered when villagers resisted a raid by Israeli troops 10 days
ago. He was shot several times in the stomach, they said.
   The body of the suspected collaborator, Jamil Al Kadoumi, 32, was
found in the Nablus casbah, or market, on Wednesday. His hands were
tied behind his back and his skull had been crushed, Arab reports
said.
   Meanwhile, doctors in a Nablus hospital said a 17-year-old, Anjad
Naaneesh, was treated for severe razor cuts cigarette burns all over
his body after masked Arab youths abducted him from his home Tuesday
night. Both his arms and legs were broken.
   The two victims were suspected of collaborating with Israel's
Shin Bet secret police, Palestinians said.
   Israeli troops continued their security sweep in the West Bank,
and the Israeli Itim news agency said that 50 Palestinian activists
were arrested. On Tuesday, an army sweep resulted in 200 arrests.

<TEXT>
   A landmark law that gives municipal sanction
to unmarried but cohabitating couples, homosexual and heterosexual,
took effect Wednesday.
   The law permits unmarried couples to register their partnerships,
similar to filing marriage licenses, to be declared ``domestic
partners.'' The legislation also grants hospital visitation rights
and bereavement leave for city employees.
   In addition, a task force is checking into whether the law may
entitle the unmarried partners of city employees to full health
coverage.
   San Francisco expects about 900 couples to register annually. To
register, a couple signs affidavits at City Hall and pays a $35 fee.
   There was no fanfare planned Wednesday to mark the new law; no
ceremonies were held. In fact, an important phamplet explaining the
complexities of the law was still at the printers.
   ``There just wasn't enough time to get all the written material
ready,'' said Jean Harris, legislative aide for San Francisco
Supervisor Harry Britt, who helped pass the law. Mayor Art Agnos
signed the bill last month.
   The real kickoff will likely be delayed until August to allow gay
organizations time to round up couples for a mass signup, said
Harris.

   South Africa's territorial administrator
said Wednesday he won't free about 30 political prisoners until he
is sure Namibia's guerrilla movement has released all its detainees.
   More than 150 people detained by the South-West Africa People's
Organization returned home from Angola on Tuesday and said more than
2,000 others still are held under harsh conditions in guerrilla
camps in Angola, Tanzania and Zambia.
   Administrator-General Louis Pienaar ``is determined to ascertain
if all SWAPO dissidents will be released before he will release
political detainees here,'' said Pienaar's spokesman, Eberhard
Hofmann.
   SWAPO says it has released all 201 of its prisoners, whom it
accused of spying for Pretoria during its 23-year bush war to end
South African administration.
   The State Department said Wednesday it is asking concerned
countries to help account for SWAPO detainees.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said: ``We are deeply concerned about
the allegations of mistreatment of Namibians by SWAPO.
   ``We have raised the question of accounting for all SWAPO
detainees with several countries in the region, and have asked them
to use their influence with SWAPO to ensure the safe repatriation of
all SWAPO detainees.''
   Boucher said two U.N. groups are investigating the claims. Some
Namibians say U.N. officials are reluctant to follow up allegations
against SWAPO.
   Andreas Shipanga, a politician and former SWAPO member imprisoned
in the 1970s, said Tuesday the head of the U.N. refugee operation in
Namibia, Nicholas Bwakira of Nigeria, ``refuses to be helpful, even
though we want to give him the names'' of people believed held by
SWAPO.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday his organization has
been investigating claims for weeks. ``It's a matter of ongoing
review,'' he said without elaborating.
   SWAPO spokesman Theo Ben-Gurirab said, ``The party urges the U.N.
special representative (Martti Ahtisaari) to prevail on the
administrator-general and the South African government to fulfill
their obligations.
   ``We have released all our detainees and we find the
administrator-general's conditions totally unacceptable,'' he said.
   Freed detainees join thousands of SWAPO-supporting refugees and
other Namibians returning to vote in U.N.-supervised independence
elections in November. SWAPO is expected to win.
   The territorial authorities hold 28 or 31 political prisoners who
support SWAPO. The different figures involve a dispute over
political versus criminal violation of the law. Pienaar has charge
of the territory until a new government is installed. But U.N.
monitors can veto decisions that would interfere with free and fair
elections.
   Also Wednesday, Pienaar sought a court interdict to stop a strike
by regional government employees in northern Ovamboland. They
stopped work Tuesday to protest the presence in the South-West
African Police force of former paramilitary police known as Koevoet.
   Koevoet was disbanded in January, but most members transferred to
the regular police. SWAPO supporters in Ovamboland _ Namibia's most
populous region and where SWAPO garners most of its support _ say
they continue to harass residents. Ahtisaari has said their presence
could interfere with elections.
   Pienaar refuses to dismiss them. He says he'll discuss the matter
with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar when he visits
Namibia on July 19.

<HEAD>Julia the City Pig to Have Her Day in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julia, a 300-pound pig who loves to have her
tummy scratched and drinks diet cola from a can, is a pet, says her
owner. She's a hog, say city officials, and can't live within city
limits.
   So now Julia's fate will be decided in court.
   Two weeks ago, at the request of Athens' animal control director,
Ron Ultz, a Municipal Court judge ordered veterinarian Bruce Young
to comply with ordinances against raising pigs in the city and to
send Julia to the country.
   Young, who found the injured piglet a year ago and took her home,
appealed to Limestone County Court and asked that a jury be allowed
to decide. ``I think I can convince a reasonable jury that she's my
pet _ and not just a ham,'' Young said Monday.
   A County clerk said because Young asked for a jury he will get
it. No court date has been set.
   ``She's a real pet who comes in the house and likes to roll over
on her back and get her tummy scratched, and I'm not going to let
her go,'' Young said.
   Young, who called Julia ``more intelligent than a lot of other
pets,'' has learned to drink diet Sun Drop Colas from a can. ``She
can't get enough of the stuff,'' said Young, who nursed the porker
on the soda.
   Julia awaits her fate while rooting inside a chain-link fence
behind Young's house, half a block from City Hall.
   Ultz said the pig's pen is unsanitary and smells bad. ``You know
what pigs are like; you know how pigs can smell,'' he said.
   Young's appearance in municpal court was the result of a
neighbor's complaint and an inspection of Julia's pen, Ultz said.
   ``The judge didn't fine him, he just ordered him to remove the
pig and that's when Bruce filed his appeal _ and I guess we go to
county court from here,'' Ultz said.

   A federal judge today delayed a decison on
a request by Pete Rose's lawyers to keep his lawsuit in a state
court, where he has won an order protecting him from suspension or
firing for alleged gambling.
   U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh said he would not make a
decision on moving the case to federal court until at least July 17.
Holschuh gave baseball's lawyers until July 12 to file papers and
Rose's lawyers until July 17 to file their response.
   The ruling indefinitely postpones a hearing scheduled for
Thursday by Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel in Cincinnati for a
preliminary injunction.
   Baseball's lawyers asked the federal courts on Monday to take the
case from Nadel, who has given Rose a temporary restraining order
that prevents Giamatti from deciding the manager's fate.
   Rose's lawyers filed papers in federal court here earlier today
to block Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti from moving the
case to federal court.
   Giamatti is fighting for the right to hold a disciplinary hearing
on charges Rose bet on his own team _ an offense that could get the
Cincinnati Reds manager banned from the game for life.
   Rose's lawyers told Holschuh there were no legal grounds to move
the case of the state court system. They accused baseball of seeking
``a third courtroom in which to vindicate themselves or at least
free the way to boot Pete Rose out of baseball without a fair
hearing before an impartial decision-maker.''
   Baseball's request was filed in federal court in Cincinnati,
which transferred it to Columbus to avoid any appearance of
impropriety in the Reds' hometown, where Rose is a hero.
   The question of which court gets to handle Rose's lawsuit could
be pivotal. Federal courts repeatedly have upheld the sweeping
powers of the baseball commissioner, while Nadel has shown a
willingness to go into what he described as ``uncharted waters.''
   ``Federal courts are much more aware of the needs of baseball and
much more willing to accept the authority of baseball and the
commissioner,'' baseball lawyer Louis Hoynes Jr. said.
   Nadel's order blocks Giamatti from holding a disciplinary
hearing. Nadel said there was evidence Giamatti had already made up
his mind that Rose is guilty. Giamatti denies that.
   Baseball's lawyers then turned to a state appeals court in
Cincinnati, which concluded it had no right to intervene.
   The next step was federal court, although two federal judges in
Cincinnati said they had ``substantial doubt'' whether the case
legally could be moved to federal court.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday it
has stopped issuing import permits for live ostriches because
African ticks that can carry livestock disease were recently found
on some of the birds.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said 18 ticks _ identified as
African Bont ticks and Bont-legged ticks _ were found on two
imported ostriches in Andrews and Quinlan, Texas, in late May.
   Some of the ``exotic'' ticks also were found later on adult
ostriches in Ohio and Oklahoma, he said.
   The USDA agency announced June 19 that African ticks had been
detected on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to
be on the alert.
   Bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater, a disease of cattle,
sheep, goats and other ruminants. However, Glosser said the ticks
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human
diseases.
   ``So far, there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to U.S.
livestock,'' he said.
   Glosser said his agency ``is reviewing inspection methods and
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed
to prevent additional pests from entering the United States.''
   He said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds
imported from Zimbabwe on April 2. Twenty-five survived and were
released 30 days later from a privately owned, USDA-approved
quarantine facility in Mundelein, Ill. Those were sent to cities in
Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.
   Glosser said 50 ostrich chicks from Tanzania also were imported
Jan. 25 and that 45 survivors were released from a private
quarantine facility in Schaumburg, Ill. They went to dealers in
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South
Carolina and Texas.
   No ticks were found on the ostrich chicks.
   ``Animal health officials placed the infested premises under
state quarantine, identified all the ostriches and are treating the
birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control
livestock ticks,'' Glosser said.
   ``Other birds or animals that may have had contact with the
ostriches or those immediately adjacent to the birds are being
examined for ticks and treated,'' he said. ``If no ticks are found,
the state or federal veterinarian will lift the quarantine and
continue a tick surveillance for six months.''
   Glosser said rabbits, birds, steers and other ``sentinel''
animals are being placed on all farm premises with the adult
ostriches to see if the ticks are still a threat to domestic
animals. Agency health officials also are trapping wildlife on the
farms to check for ticks.
   Heartwater affects the heart, lymph nodes and brain of livestock,
causing muscle twitching, diarrhea, convulsions and death.
   Glosser said the ticks are reddish-orange or dark brown and
commonly attach themselves to the neck, udder, hoof or tail area of
livestock.

   From the knot of demonstrators chanting for TV
cameras to the shorts-clad tourists hoping for a glimpse of a
celebrity, the streets outside the courthouse where Oliver North was
sentenced had the look of news in the making.
   Except for the presence of any of the principals in the case.
   After U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell announced his
sentence for the 45-year-old former National Security Council aide
on Wednesday, North and his attorneys left the building through a
side door and clambered into a waiting van, saying nothing to
reporters.
   One voice shouted over the crowd, ``Ollie North, you're a hero!''
and the ex-Marine lieutenant colonel could be seen through the van's
dark-tinted windows smiling.
   Minutes earlier, chief prosecutor John Keker was equally
closed-mouth as he burst through scores of reporters and camera
crews at the courthouse's front entrance and ducked into a car.
   ``It's kind of ridiculous to have all these cameras and all of
this expense, just to see a guy walk out,'' said Bernie Doll, a
Washington psychiatrist at the scene because he was on jury duty and
awaiting assignment to a trial. ``It's a crazy world and getting
crazier.''
   Gesell had set the time of sentencing for 10 a.m. By 9 a.m. about
20 North supporters, clean-cut, well-dressed and mostly in their
20s, had mustered outside the drab gray courthouse at the foot of
Capitol Hill. Some carried printed ``Oliver North American Hero''
signs. Others toted hand-painted banners, and one hoisted a yellow
``Don't Tread on Me'' flag depicting a coiled rattlesnake.
   Polite and orderly, peering intermittently at the muggy overcast
skies for signs of a possible downpour, they erupted when cameras
came into view.
   ``Pardon North now,'' they chanted. ``North American hero.''
   The largest contingent outside the building, by far, was the
press. Nearly 30 television cameras were poised at the front
entrance, along with scores of reporters and photographers. Another
throng lurked at the side door.
   A handful of tourists gathered.
   ``I wanted to see what he looked like personally,'' Betty
Donovan, visiting town from Woburn, Mass., said of North.
   Frank Enten, a 58-year-old retiree from Bethesda, Md., and a
self-described ``Ollie North supporter from day one,'' set up a
sidewalk stand and began selling buttons to the faithful.
   ``The Duke would have loved Ollie,'' said one that depicted North
and the late actor John Wayne, their visages tilted heavenward.
Others portrayed Fawn Hall, North's former secretary, a flag
unfurled behind her and the inscription, ``Thanks for your support _
Fawn Hall.'' Others implored, ``Victory Over Communism'' and ``I'm a
Contra Too.''
   ``I thought there'd be a bigger crowd,'' said Enten, who said
business had been slow. ``I guess a lot of people couldn't get off
work.''
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., a conservative and North supporter,
attended the sentencing, left the courtroom and stepped up to the
cluster of microphones positioned outside the building.
   ``He did not seem overly dejected,'' Dornan said when asked about
North's reaction to the sentence. The lawmaker said he believed the
sentence, which included no jail time, was ``on the low side of what
we expected.''
   Dornan spent much of his time explaining that he would not
immediately send a letter to President Bush that he had distributed
to reporters before the sentencing. The letter, signed by 58 members
of Congress, said North should spend no time in prison, and asked
Bush to pardon him.

   From the Shaker chair to the latest style of
seating device, the world's first museum exclusively dedicated to
design opens Thursday with a three-dimensional history of everyday
comforts and high-tech gadgets.
   ``I want to make people aware of everyday things and see them as
life-enhancing,'' said Sir Terence Conran, founder of the Design
Museum who made a fortune from his Habitat store chain. ``It's the
culmination of a dream.''
   Conran, 57, has turned a derelict 1950s warehouse at Butlers
Wharf _ ``a concrete monstrosity infested with rats'' he said _ into
a gleaming showplace of consumer civilization on the south bank of
the Thames river by Tower Bridge.
   ``Everything man-made has been designed and this is the first
museum in the world to show how mass-produced consumer objects were
designed and the first to explain why and how they work and look as
they do,'' the millionaire retailer said.
   ``It shows how design contributes to the quality of our lives,''
he said in an interview Wednesday before the museum's official
opening by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   One floor of the $11 million museum displays technological
marvels like pocket all-world radios and suitcase computers, the
smartest thing in baby strollers, lampstands, tableware, bicycles
and TV receivers.
   There is the famous 1927 red telephone booth of Sir Giles Scott,
now discarded by up-to-the-minute British Telecom but so loved by
ordinary Britons that public uproar forced authorities last year to
give more than 1,000 of them official protection from scrapping.
   A permanent collection of 400 exhibits shows how modern objects
evolved: from flat irons to railway timetables, paperback books,
newspaper pages, sewing machines, motor scooters, soapflake
packaging, iceboxes, washing machines and fountain pens.
   There are 44 different chairs, starting with a 1900 American
Shaker design on rockers from the Christian sect that believed in
communal living.
   Reproductions of such famous icons as Leonardo da Vinci's ``Mona
Lisa'' on a tablemat, and designers of home furnishings seeking
museum treasures to copy onto drapes and cushion covers, show
culture and commerce coming together.
   A video screen unrolls well-known British TV commercials for
autos, coffee and jeans that newspapers discuss endlessly because
their readers say the advertisements are better than the programs
they are designed to interrupt.
   Besides lectures and seminars on creativity, work and technology,
the museum will run movies featuring the sets of famous designers.
   Many of the latest products shown are Japanese.
   ``It's not surprising, because after 30 years of looking,
listening and copying, the Japanese are developing their own design
culture, which is enormous and remarkable,'' said Conran.
   The museum grew out of the Boilerhouse Project, the first venture
of Conran's charitable Conran Foundation, which ran 23 exhibitions
on design at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1982-1986, seen by
more than 1.5 milion people.
   Bayley, 37, who ran the Boilerhouse, described the new museum as
a ``classroom dedicated to the present and future of everyday life.''
   Museum visitors can see through its big windows the 900-year-old
Tower of London and the modern office blocks of the City financial
district.

<HEAD>Shamir Adopts Hard-line Stand That Could Killed His Ailing Peace
Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, giving in
to demands from hawks in his right-wing Likud bloc, on Wednesday
adopted a hard line that may make it more difficult to sell his
peace proposals to Palestinians.
   Shamir, in putting down a challenge to his leadership, came out
strongly in favor of more Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories and the exclusion of 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem
from proposed elections to choose Palestinian negotiators.
   He also demanded an end to violence associated with the
Palestinian uprising before any vote could be held and rejected any
possibility of a Palestinian state being formed.
   Shamir's hard-line speech raised a debate on whether his stands
killed his plan for a vote among the 1.7 million residents of the
occupied territories to choose representatives to negotiate limited
Palestinian self-rule.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the rival Labor Party,
attacked the statements and raised the possibility his center-left
party would drop out of the coalition government.
   ``I think they have put heavy shackles on the peace process, and
the Labor Party institutions will have to debate where we go from
here,'' Peres said. ``I know there are some members who have reached
a conclusion that we should leave the government.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization had criticized the plan as
a device to prevent creation of a Palestinian state.
   In his address to 2,600 wildly cheering members of the Likud's
Central Committee, Shamir used tough language that could further
alienate Palestinians and thwart U.S. efforts to arrange peace talks.
   While he noted the U.S. view that settlements are an obstacle to
peace, Shamir sent his ``warm blessing'' to 80,000 settlers in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We call for continuation of Jewish settlement in Judea, Samaria
(West Bank) and the Gaza Strip. ... Every Jew who wants to will be
able to settle in any place in the land of Israel and will receive
support and security from the Israeli government,'' Shamir said.
   He also restated Israel's claim to east Jerusalem, which was
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and which the PLO
has demanded be the capital of a Palestinian state.
   ``Jerusalem is not part of the initiative,'' Shamir declared,
sweeping aside a key Palestinian demand that east Jerusalem Arabs be
allowed to take part in the proposed elections.
   He also said Israel's security forces would ``wipe out'' the
Palestinian uprising before any election was held.
   Shamir's speech quieted a revolt led by Trade and Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon, who wanted to amend the plan to include the
hard-line Likud positions.
   Shamir won overwhelming approval, by a show of hands, for a
compromise vote to accept his speech as party policy, while not
considering attempts to alter the plan.
   Officials have said the plan, approved by the coalition
government on May 14, is deliberately vague in an attempt to appeal
to Palestinians by leaving key questions open to later negotiations.
   Likud and Labor officials disagreed on the implications of
Shamir's speech.
   ``Nothing has changed,'' said Justice Minister Dan Meridor, a
Shamir supporter. ``All that we have today is a firm Likud
resolution behind the peace plan. There was a question mark over the
peace initiative. Now all of Likud is bound to it.''
   But Chaim Ramon of the center-left Labor Party, which shares
power with Likud in the coalition government, said ``today's
decision certainly torpedoes the peace plan.''
   Sharon said the party decision was binding on the 12 Likud
Cabinet ministers. In an Israel Radio interview, he said the points
adopted by Shamir ``make it very clear how far Israel can go and
where we will not be going.''
   But aides to Shamir who demanded anonymity said the positions
stated by Shamir were not binding on the peace plan and were only a
restatement of Likud policy.

<HEAD>Gov't Says Cleanup of Scandals Doesn't Aim To Stir Up Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new conservative-communist coalition
government said Wednesday that a promised cleanup of scandals that
helped bring down the Socialists aims to end the controversy, not
stir it up.
   ``Everything necessary will be done to set the cleansing process
in motion,'' said Athanassios Kanellopoulos, minister to
conservative Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis.
   ``But the spirit is not to perpetuate the issue or give the
impression that a war by everyone against everyone is being
started,'' he said.
   Kanellopoulos said officials will investigate a banking scandal,
alleged kickbacks in the purchases of U.S. and French-made
warplanes, wiretapping, and missing government files since the new
government took power Sunday.
   The conservative New Democracy party and a Communist Party-led
alliance that calls itself the Coalition of Left and Progress formed
a government after no party won an absolute majority in the June 18
elections.
   The new government partners said they would govern for three
months to investigate and prosecute officials in former Premier
Andreas Papandreou's government who allegedly were involved in
multimillion-dollar banking and financial scandals.
   The Socialists' alleged involvement in the scandals and
70-year-old Papandreou's romance with a 35-year-old woman before he
divorced contributed to his downfall after eight years in office.
   On Wednesday, Papandreou left a hospital after 13 days of
treatment for pneumonia and kidney failure. Accompanied by his
girlfriend, Dmitra Liani, he went to the Parliament building to be
sworn in as a deputy to serve as opposition leader. He kept his seat
in the June 18 elections.
   The banking scandal involves the $200 million embezzlement and
fraud affair involving fugitive banker George Koskotas. The former
Bank of Crete chairman, in a U.S. jail pending a hearing for his
extradition to Greece, accused the Socialist administration of
masterminding and authorizing the fraud.
   Koskotas, accused of using the bank funds to build a publishing
empire and to buy a top Greek soccer team, has said in interviews
from jail that Socialist officials, including Papandreou, received
bribes from him.
   Kanellopoulos said the purchase of warplanes from the United
States and France will be investigated. Socialist officials have
been accused of receiving kickbacks from Greece's purchase of 40
F-16 and 40 Mirage 2000 jet fighters.
   He said the government also will look into the case of Yugoslav
corn sold as a Greek product to European Economic Community
countries and alleged widespread wiretapping by the state-run Greek
Telecommunications Organization.
   Justice Minister Fotis Kouvelis said Tuesday that the cleansing
could be hampered by the lack of documents in ministries.
   Ministers who took over this week said they found confidential
files missing from their Socialist predecessors' offices.
   Tzannetakis said he could not find a single file in Papandreou's
office.
   The new premier said he was told by one of Papandreou's advisors
that ``when problems were solved we tore up the documents. Therefore
there are no documents, we solved all problems.''
   Kanellopoulos said the government would investigate why the files
were missing.
   Papandreou failed to win a third term in office when his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement won only 125 seats in the 300-seat
unicameral Parliament. New Democracy won 145 seats and the
Communists won 28. The remainder went to a small conservative party
and an independent.

   Cuba's troop withdrawal from Angola
is on schedule and Washington believes negotiations to end the civil
war there will succeed, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman
Cohen said Wednesday.
   Cohen said the U.S.-brokered peace accord signed by Angola, Cuba
and South Africa ``is working very well. The retreat of Cuban forces
is exactly on schedule ... the same thing for South Africa.''
   He arrived in Abidjan, the Ivorian capital, after visiting South
Africa and Namibia. He will attend a meeting of the commission
monitoring the withdrawal Friday in Luanda, Angola.
   Under the agreement, the more than 50,000 Cuban troops are to
leave Angola by July 1991. South Africa pulled out its forces from
Angola and is withdrawing from Namibia under a U.N. independence
plan for the territory.
   Cuba has helped Luanda's government fight Jonas Savimbi's
U.S.-backed guerrillas and incursions by South African troops
supporting Savimbi.
   At an African summit in Zaire last month, Savimbi and Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos called a cease-fire and agreed to
negotiate an end to 14 years of civil war that has devastated the
Southern African nation.
   They suffered a setback last week when dos Santos accused
Savimbi's fighters of breaking the truce.
   Cohen said tough negotiations lie ahead, ``but I believe they are
both committed to a solution, a political solution.''
   He also said hopes for peace are improving in Mozambique.
   Angola and Mozambique both have Marxist governments and have
suffered civil wars since the 1970s, when Portuguese colonizers
hastily withdraw, leaving opposing guerrilla armies that warred for
independence to fight it out. Wars in both countries have turned
into a stalemate.
   Cohen said he hoped to discuss peace prospects next week during
talks with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
   ``We support the government of Mozambique and I will be
consulting with him to see if we can be helpful. I believe a
pre-negotiating situation exists there and I am hopeful that it will
move onto a real negotiating situation.
   ``Mozambique also can resolve its conflict through a political
solution. A military solution is impossible,'' he said.
   Guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance said Tuesday
they are ``ready and willing'' for peace talks with no prior
conditions as long as the government accepts the same arrangement.
   Chissano has ruled out direct talks, but has permitted indirect
contacts through church leaders.

   Several Rocky Flats workers were exposed to high
levels of radiation in seven incidents at the nuclear weapons plant
from 1981 through 1987, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   ``Unusual occurrence'' reports obtained by The Denver Post
detailed incidents in which workers were injured because of their
own negligence or inadequate safety measures at the plant, including
radiation exposures that were not previously made public.
   The newspaper based its story on 36 reports it obtained from DOE
under the Freedom of Information Act. Most of the reports detail
incidents that did not involve radioactive material.
   One report cited by the Post described an accident where an
electrician inhaled plutonium. Rockwell International Corp., which
operates the plant for the Department of Energy, said the amount of
plutonium in the worker's lungs was 5.5 percent of Rockwell's
maximum permissible lung burden.
   Many health officials say any measurable amount of plutonium
inhaled into one's lungs can lead to serious health problems and
even death, the Post said.
   FBI and Environmental Protection Agency agents are investigating
allegations that hazardous waste was disposed of illegally at the
plant.
   The newspaper cited seven incidents involving radiation exposure
that affected at least nine workers. In some cases the number of
workers involved was not specified.
   In a Feb. 15, 1984, report, Rockwell said an electrician who
asked for a ``body count'' radiation test was found to have
``elevated'' levels of plutonium in his lungs, apparently after he
repaired a pump without using respiratory protection.
   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz said details on the electrician's
health are confidential. ``We don't consider that level to be a
serious problem,'' Heintz said. ``But any plutonium is obviously
something you don't want to get inside your system.''
   Heintz did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on
the other six incidents detailed in the Post from the DOE report.
They are:
   _On April 3, 1985, two workers in Building 371 accidentally
inhaled plutonium, but the incident report indicated there was
``little or no'' plutonium deposited in their lungs.
   _In July 1985, body counts of workers in Building 779 after a
release of radioactive contamination into a lab area showed some had
inhaled radioactive materials.
   _A month later, three workers were contaminated with plutonium in
Rocky Flats' main plutonium reprocessing center. They were
successfully decontaminated, the report says.
   _In December 1985, truck drivers and janitors were ``directly or
indirectly handling radioactive material unknowingly and without
precautions'' after a small amount of radioactive waste
inadvertently got into non-radioactive trash headed for a landfill
on the plant grounds.
   Guards outside the area from which the trash was taken ignored
radiation alarms that went off as the truck was about to leave.
   _On Nov. 3, 1986, three workers in Building 771 were exposed to
``high levels of radiation'' from plutonium oxide that was released
accidentally during an equipment failure. No contamination of their
lungs was discovered, the report said.
   _Radiation was released in Building 707 after an emergency
electrical system failure Nov. 23, 1986. No one was in the area.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say Verification Key Issue in START Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. negotiator in U.S.-Soviet
talks in Geneva on long-range nuclear weapons assured NATO allies
that verification is a key issue.
   Negotiator Richard Burt discussed at length the American
proposals offered since the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks resumed
late last month, according to a U.S. official.
   The allies questioned the negotiators about such issues as mobile
missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles as well as verification,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Burt told the allies that any U.S.-Soviet agreement has to be
based on a ``good strong verification regime,'' the official said.
   Burt and another negotiator, Henry F. Cooper, met privately with
representatives of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization
in Brussels. It was the first time that Burt, the former ambassador
to West Germany, talked to the allies in his new job.
   NATO's press office said the allies ``welcomed the opportunity
for confidential exchanges on developments in the Geneva talks, on
the basis of a detailed report made by the U.S. negotiators.''
   The U.S.-Soviet talks, which resumed after a seven-month recess,
are expected to end in early August.
   President Bush has suggested Washington and Moscow begin testing
verification procedures during the arms negotiations, rather than
waiting until an agreement is wrapped up.
   They could carry out trial inspections at each other's missile
sites and discuss equipment needed for assuring compliance with a
treaty.
   The Bush proposals are designed in part to build support in the
Senate for ratification of an eventual accord.
   Several arms control deals, including the 1979 SALT 2 treaty on
limiting long-range nuclear arsenals, were never ratified because of
Senate concerns about adequate verification methods.
   The START negotiations, which began in March 1985, are aimed at
reducing U.S. and Soviet strategic or long-range bombers, missiles
and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   The pact is intended to cover nuclear weapons that the two
superpowers could use to strike each other, including sea- and
land-based missiles as well as heavy bombers.
   In earlier rounds of talks, both sides agreed to lowered ceilings
of 6,000 nuclear wearheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles
and bombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system for monitoring
compliance were also set.

   Text of the declaration of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and French President Francois Mitterrand, as translated
from French by The Associated Press:
   M.S. Gorbachev and F. Mitterrand expressed their profound
preoccupation with respect to the situation of persistent crisis in
Lebanon, as well as the misfortunes and sufferings of the Lebanese
population. They call for an immediate cease-fire, rigorously
respected, as an indispensable condition for the establishment of a
constructive inter-Lebanese dialogue, aiming at national
reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded on a
balance of the interests of all Lebanese communities. They judge
also that these measures should be taken urgently to assure an end
to arms deliveries to any Lebanese group in conflict.
   While proclaiming their support for the mission of the
``committee of three'' of the Arab League on Lebanon, the U.S.S.R.
and France reiterated their availability to contribute by all means
to pacification efforts, and notably, in the framework of the United
Nations Security Council, in liaison with the mission it has
confided to the Secretary General.
   M.S. Gorbachev and F. Mitterrand are convinced that Lebanon must
remain a sovereign, independent, united, with its territorial
integrity respected, as well as a full and effective member of the
international community.''

<HEAD>African National Congress To Open Information Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress, an outlawed
South African anti-apartheid group, intends to open an information
office in Washington this year, an official of the organization said
Wednesday.
   The decision is likely to generate controversy in light of
opposition from conservative American groups to Soviet support for
the ANC and to what they regard as the group's Marxist orientation.
   The Defense Department listed the ANC among 52 terrorist
organizations worldwide in a report entitled ``Terrorist Group
Profiles,'' which was released in January. The State Department
expressed reservations about inclusion of the group in the report,
saying the United States supports the ANC's goal of ending the
apartheid system of racial discrimination in South Africa but
opposes its violent methods.
   ``We need to establish ourselves strongly in this city,'' said
Dumi Matabani, a South African who has been representing the ANC
from his home here for the past eight years.
   Matabani said an office would be opened before the end of the
year, once funding and space for the facility have been organized.
   Matabani is registered with the Justice Department as a foreign
agent representing the ANC for lobbying and information purposes.
The new office will also be registered, in keeping with U.S. law, he
added.
   The ANC, which also gets help from African and European
countries, hopes recent actions by the administration of George Bush
herald a more conciliatory approach toward the organization.
   Former Secretary of State George Shultz met with ANC leader
Oliver Tambo several years ago and there have been other official
contacts with the organization, which also maintains an office at
the United Nations. But Matabani said he does not have any regular
contacts with the State Department, adding that U.S. officials are
not generally ``eager to hear what we have to say.''
   The Bush administration, unlike the Reagan one, has taken an
active role in seeking to promote negotiations between the black
majority in South Africa and the white-dominated government.
   Last week, Bush hosted a leading anti-apartheid activist,
Albertina Sisulu, at the White House. F.W. de Klerk, who is expected
to assume the country's presidency later this year, is expected to
visit the United States next month and become the first South
African leader to do so in 30 years.
   The ANC, founded 75 years ago, was outlawed by South Africa in
1960 and its leader, Nelson Mandela, was jailed. The group began a
sabotage campaign one year later, claiming it had no alternative
against the government.

<TEXT>
   The Army's destruction of its last Pershing
1A ballistic missile on Thursday will eliminate an entire class of
nuclear weapons for the first time.
   Weather permitting, in separate firings at the Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant, two missile sections strapped horizontally on
reinforced stands will consume their solid fuel propellant. After
the firing renders the missile useless, the sections are to be
crushed.
   The operation comes under provisions of the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty between the United States and the Soviet
Union, signed in December 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A 10-member Soviet inspection team was scheduled to monitor
Thursday's event, which marks the destruction of the 169th and last
Pershing 1A, plant spokeswoman Dorothy Grant said.
   The INF treaty, which took effect June 1, 1988, requires
elimination of 859 American intermediate-range and shorter range
missiles and 1,752 similar Soviet missiles within three years.
   The missiles marked for destruction, which have a range of 300 to
3,400 miles, are unarmed. Nuclear warheads and electronic guidance
systems were removed, with the warheads being stored by the
Department of Energy.
   The destruction of the 5,500-pound Pershing 1A is being handled
by Utah-based Morton Thiokol Inc., which built many of the Pershing
motors at Longhorn.
   Larger Pershing 2 missiles will continue to be destroyed under
terms of the treaty. At Longhorn, Ms. Grant said nine Pershing 2
missiles have been eliminated, with 234 more headed for the junk
heap worldwide. In addition, hundreds of ground-launched cruise
missiles will be destroyed by the Air Force, she said.
   Besides Longhorn, Pershing 2 missiles also are being eliminated
from an Army depot near Pueblo, Colo. Other missiles are being taken
out of service at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., and near
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The Soviets began destruction of several classes of similar
missiles a year ago.
   The treaty allows the missiles to be burned in place and then
crushed, to be destroyed with explosives or to be launched without
warheads. American officials have said they chose burning in place
because it is the cheapest and cleanest method.
   Thursday's affair was expected to be a much lower-key event than
the first destruction at Longhorn Sept. 8, 1988.
   Then-Vice President Bush made the first missile's demise a stop
on a campaign swing through Texas. Trailing him were about 300
reporters and photographers. Bush hailed the event as ``the day we
began to reverse the arms race ... the day we began destroying the
weapons of destruction.''

<HEAD>Prosecution Demands Death Penalty in Cuban Court Martial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military prosecutor is demanding the death
penalty for seven Cuban officers, including war hero Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa, court-martialed on charges of high treason, drug
trafficking and corruption.
   The prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Juan Escalona also asked for prison
terms of 15 to 30 years for seven others before resting his case
Tuesday night, the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said
in dispatches from Havana.
   The Prensa Latina dispatches, monitored here Wednesday, did not
say when the three-man military court expects to render a verdict.
   Escalona demanded the death penalty for Ochoa, Antonio de la
Guardia, Jorge Martinez, Amado Padron, Antonio Sanchez, Eduardo Diaz
and Alexis Lago, and asked for 30-year prison terms for de la
Guardia's twin brother, Patricio, a brigadier general, and Capt.
Rosa Maria Abierno, the only woman in the group.
   He also asked for 25 years imprisonment for former officers
Leonel Estevez, Jose Luis Pineda, Gabriel Prendes and Miguel Ruiz,
and 15 years for Antonio Rodriguez.
   All of them have been stripped of rank and decorations and
dishonorably discharged from the armed forces. Ochoa, 57, was a
much-decorated hero of Cuban military intervention in Angola and
Ethiopia and special missions in Nicaragua and Venezuela.
   According to testimony at the trial, the 14 belonged to a special
Interior Ministry unit that smuggled hospital equipment, medicines
and other scarce but essential items into Cuba. The items were
smuggled to circumvent a U.S. trade and economic embargo that has
battered Cuba's economy since it was imposed in the 1960s.
   But Escalona told the court the accused also smuggled cocaine and
other drugs into the United States, dealt in contraband diamonds,
ivory and fine woods on the side for their own profit.
   ``The evidence and testimony confirming the crime of treason is
overwhelming,'' Escalona was quoted as saying as he summed up the
case before the court Tuesday night.
   About $1.2 million and 423,000 pesos in cash were seized when the
accused were arrested, as well as 39 expensive automobiles, a
motorcycle and 186 firearms, Prensa Latina said. It said
investigators also located a secret bank account held by Ochoa in
Panama, and the money was transferred to Cuba.
   Testimony from witnesses and confessions from the accused
indicated they dealt with Colombia's Medellin cartel, the world's
largest drug trafficking ring. For 2{ years they allowed tons of
contraband cocaine from Colombia and shiploads of marijuana from
Jamaica pass through Cuban territorial waters and airspace into the
United States.
   Ms. Abierno also confessed that she helped smuggle cocaine
concealed in computers by speedboat to Florida.
   Escalona said these and other felonies constituted ``hostile
acts'' against the United States, Mexico, Colombia and Panama. He
said they ``robbed and deceived'' Nicaragua's Sandinista government,
with which Cuba's communist regime maintains close ties.
   Escalona told the court that Ochoa ``deceived the Nicaraguans,
robbing them of big sums of money,'' and ``robbing the Sandinistas
also means betraying Cuba.''
   Calling Ochoa the main culprit, Escalona said the cashiered
general also ``weakened the prestige and defense of the Cuban
revolution.''
   ``Ochoa's betrayal of Cuba was even more serious when he betrayed
the Angolans by black market deals when he was chief of the Cuban
military mission in that African country,'' Escalona said.
   Escalona said Ochoa planned to ``build a mansion with fine woods
from the Angolan jungles and enjoyed all the human and divine
pleasures by incurring in multiple immoral acts.''

   The Library of Congress has acquired the only
known set of the first edition of Alexis de Tocqueville's classic
``Democracy in America'' in its original paper bindings, the library
announced Wednesday.
   The two-volume set was bought from a Parisian bookseller for
$80,000 last spring, using public and private funds reserved for
special library acquisitions, officials said. The rare first
editions will be displayed in an exhibition opening Sept. 8 on
Tocqueville's works.
   Tocqueville, a French historian and political theorist, wrote
``Democracy in America,'' a four-volume interpretation of democratic
institutions in the United States, after an extensive tour of
America in the 1830s.
   The first two volumes, published in 1835, deal with the influence
of the doctrine of equality on politics and law. Of the handful of
first editions that survive, library officials said, the newly
acquired set is believed to be the only one that exists in pristine
condition, with original paper bindings.

   Farmers spent $118.4 billion on production
expenses last year, up 7.5 percent from $110.1 billion in 1987, a
preliminary report by the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Despite the increase, 1988 expenditures were still far below the
record level of $131.8 billion in 1981, just before the general
financial crunch that stalled expansion in the nation's agricultural
sector.
   By 1986, annual spending by farmers dropped to less than $106
billion, indicating massive cutbacks in capital investments as land
values plummeted and debts burdened so many.
   According to the latest report by the department's National
Agricultural Statistics Service, 1988 expenditures were higher for
all major categories except interest, which decreased 3.7 percent to
$8.37 billion, and building and fencing, which dropped 10.3 percent
to $2.23 billion.
   Farm services, which include rent, accounted for the largest 1988
expenditures by farmers, totaling $24.6 billion, or 21 percent of
the total. That was up 2.7 percent from 1987.
   Spending on feed for livestock totaled $17.9 billion was up 20
percent from 1987 and accounted for 15 percent of last year's total.
   Overall, 1988 production expenditures averaged $54,956 per farm,
an increase of $4,165 from 1987, the report said.
   The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not
include figures for net income or profits.

   A Puerto Rican nationalist sentenced to the
federal prison in Atlanta for burning an American flag has been
freed since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such a protest is a
legal exercise of freedom of speech.
   Greg Bogdan, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in
Washington, D.C., confirmed Wednesday that Carlos Mendoza-Lugo, 36,
was freed last week.
   Mendoza-Lugo had filed a petition in U.S. District Court seeking
release after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling June 21.
   Bogdan said the Puerto Rican magistrate who sentenced
Mendoza-Lugo to the maximum one year in prison reduced the sentence
to seven months, making him eligible for release.
   But he said he did not know when the judge reduced the sentence
or whether the reduction was tied to the Supreme Court ruling. He
said Mendoza-Lugo was freed June 30, when the notification arrived
in Atlanta.
   Mendoza-Lugo, a professional photographer, was convicted of
burning a flag in front of the U.S. Post Office in his home town of
Anasco, Puerto Rico, on March 16, 1987.
   Wind kept blowing out his matches and he only singed the flag,
but he pleaded guilty to one charge of flag desecration.
   Mendoza-Lugo said he was protesting continued American control of
Puerto Rico and pressing for Puerto Rican independence.
   ``I never intended to degrade the American people,'' he said from
jail last week. ``It wasn't an act of vandalism. I was protesting.
It's unconstitutional for me to be in jail when I was making use of
my freedom of speech.''
   Federal judiciary officials have said that others jailed on the
same charge likely also will be freed as a result of the Supreme
Court ruling.
   The Bureau of Prisons said the number of people jailed on the
charge is very small, but that such statistics are not kept
separately.

<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 16 grafs to UPDATE with Orzechowski comment, caucus
support for Jaruzelski; pickup 12th pvs, `In activity...' ^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The legislature will put off electing
Poland's new president until after President Bush visits next week,
a Communist official announced Wednesday.
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, leader of the Communist
deputies caucus in the Sejm, said the election by the National
Assembly could not be held earlier because state officials will be
out of the country Friday and Saturday and will be busy after that
with the Bush visit.
   The news came on the second day of the meeting of Poland's new
Sejm and Senate, the first legislature in four decades in the East
bloc to have opposition representation.
   Bush is to visit Poland July 9-11 at the invitation of Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who will accompany Bush during his
activities in Warsaw and Gdansk. Before that, Jaruzelski will be
attending a conference of Warsaw Pact political leaders in Bucharest
on Friday and Saturday.
   Orzechowski said at a news conference that he expected the
presidential vote before July 22, Poland's national day, and that
his caucus supported Jaruzelski for the post.
   Communist Party and Solidarity officials earlier insisted the new
president would be chosen before Bush's visit. The postponement
appeared related to ongoing indecision over who the party will
nominate for the new six-year office that will oversee the army and
foreign relations.
   The presidency, a powerful post similar to the one created in the
Soviet Union for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is being restored after 37
years.
   The president will oversee the army and foreign policy. He will
be elected by the Sejm and Senate sitting together as the National
Assembly, where the Communist coalition will have a 300-259 majority
over Solidarity legislators.
   Jaruzelski had been the party's prime candidate, but he surprised
the nation Friday by announcing he would not run and nominating
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak instead.
   Since then, the party has asked Jaruzelski to reconsider.
Orzechowski said he believed Jaruzelski still had not made a
decision Wednesday.
   He said the Communist caucus ``supports the candidacy of Gen.
Jaruzelski and is leading its activities in this direction.''
Jaruzelski was the best candidate ``because of internal and
international reasons,'' Orzechowski said.
   Solidarity Sejm Deputy Adam Michnik has proposed that the union
support the Communist candidate if Solidarity is given the right to
form the next government.
   Behind-the-scenes negotiations on such an arrangement evidently
continued.
   Although initially greeted with skepticism by Solidarity members
reluctant to take power so quickly, especially with the economy in
disarray, Michnik's proposal appeared to gain cautious support among
others quoted Wednesday in the union's Election Gazette daily.
   The proposal should be taken as ``an indication of a political
possibility,'' said Sejm Deputy Jacek Kuron.
   The Communist Party leadership has not responded to the proposal.
Orzechowski said Communist lawmakers would discuss details of a new
government after the president is elected.
   In activity at the Sejm meeting, Solidarity deputy Julius Braun
demanded that officials explain a case of alleged police brutality
on picketers.
   The remarks at the end of the day's meeting followed routine work
in which the parliament certified last month's elections and
considered candidates to the watchdog State Tribunal that oversees
government officials.
   Braun said from the podium that peaceful picketers were attacked
overnight ``in a brutal way'' by plainclothes police in front of the
parliament. They were holding banners opposing against the
presidential candidacy of Jaruzelski.
   The demonstrators were from the banned anti-communist
Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   Saying his question was directed to Kiszczak, head of the police,
Braun asked: ``What were the intentions of the people who ordered
this action on the first day of the parliament session?''
   The question was shown during the live nationwide TV broadcast of
the Sejm and drew applause from many delegates. Speaker Mikolaj
Kozakiewicz said Kiszczak would be called to the chamber at its next
sitting to answer.
   The 161 Solidarity parliament deputies were installed Tuesday
alongside 299 Communist coalition members, creating the first East
bloc legislature since the late 1940s to include a political
opposition.
   The freely elected Senate, with 98 Solidarity representatives out
of 100 seats, also met Tuesday and Wednesday. Only one seat in that
chamber was won by a non-Solidarity member: pro-communist
businessman Henryk Stoklosa. One seat is vacant due to the death
last week of Solidarity senator-elect Grzegorz Bialkowski.
   Bialkowski, rector of Warsaw University, was buried Wednesday in
a funeral attended by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and hundreds of
union supporters and members of the academic community.

   At least 550 people died nationwide in traffic
accidents over the long Fourth of July weekend.
   California reported the most fatalities, 78, followed by Texas
with 34 and Ohio with 25 during the four-day weekend beginning at 6
p.m. local time Friday and ending at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
   Two states reported no fatalities _ Alaska and Montana.
   The national toll was lower than expected by the National Safety
Council. The council estimated last week that 570 to 670 people
would die in accidents during this year's holiday weekend.
   Last year, there were 463 highway deaths during the three-day
Fourth of July weekend.
   The highest toll for a four-day Fourth of July holiday period was
recorded in 1972, when 758 people were killed. The highest toll for
a three-day Independence Day weekend was 638 deaths in 1971.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Rejects Another Cabinet Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the new Soviet legislature voted down a
second Cabinet nominee Wednesday and roundly criticized another
before approving him.
   On Monday, the Supreme Soviet refused to confirm incumbent
Vladimir M. Kamentsev as minister of foreign economic policy.
   Before voting 204-130 on Wednesday to reject Nikolai S. Konarev
as railway minister, Tass said, legislators cited the industry's
poor safety record and shoddy service. He has had the job since 1982.
   More than 600 people on two trains were killed June 4 when a
spark from a railroad line ignited a highly flammable mixture of
benzine and propane-butane gas that had leaked from a pipeline into
a Ural Mountain valley. At least 118 people died in rail accidents
reported last year.
   The official news agency said members of the Supreme Soviet
accused Vladimir Chirskov's agemcy of safety and environmental
lapses, including responsibility for the Urals gas explosion, but
confirmed for another term as minister of oil and gas construction.
   Culture Minister Vasily G. Zakharov, Sports Committee chairman
Marat Gramov and six other nominees were withdrawn last month after
failing to win support from committees of the legislature, which
replaced the former rubber-stamp Supreme Soviet this spring.
   One minister confirmed had a familiar name. Vladimir Brezhnev,
minister of transport construction since 1985, said in response to a
question that he was a cousin of the late Leonid I. Brezhnev, who
now is blamed for corruption and economic stagnation.
   Brezhnev, 58, said his mother and the late leader's mother were
sisters, Tass reported, but an editor at Tass said the surnames were
coincidence.
   Seven other ministerial candidates were approved: Nikolai
Kotlyar, 54, incumbent fisheries minister; Igor Koksanov, 61,
incumbent minister of shipbuilding; Yuri Volmer, incumbent merchant
marine minister; Vladimir Shimko, 51, radio industry; Serafim
Kolpakov, 56, metallurgy; Boris Belousov, 55, defense industries,
and Oleg Shishkin, 55, machine-building minsiter.

<HEAD>NOW Plans Huge Abortion Rights March for October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the National Organization for Women,
joining in an abortion rights rally across from the White House,
pledged Wednesday to mobilize a march on the Capitol that they hope
will draw up to 1 million Americans.
   ``We will organize with NOW the largest mass mobilization in
history,'' said NOW President Molly Yard. ``We are going to turn
this country upside down because we aren't going to take it
anymore,'' she said, referring to Monday's Supreme Court decision
that allows states to restrict abortions.
   ``We're not about to go home and give up,'' Yard told a
rain-dampened crowd of several hundred who had gathered in a park
across the street from the White House. ``We are going to stay and
fight.''
   Yard announced that NOW has begun plans for a ``mass mobilization
of the American people'' in Washington at the end of October. The
march will be part of the group's ``Freedom Campaign for Women's
Life,'' which also will include a ``Freedom Caravan'' that will
travel into every state to educate women about the abortion rights
movement.
   With one NOW official estimating an attendance of more than 1
million Americans, Yard told the crowd, ``That will make the Equal
Rights march look like a peanut compared to the giant that will come
out here in October.''
   ``We will make this country understand that this country is about
religious freedom, it's about democracy and justice. We can't allow
the no-nothings, including George Bush, to keep on running this
country.''
   In April, abortion rights activists lobbied on Capitol Hill to
try and influence the Supreme Court's decision. Crowd-size estimates
ranged from 300,000 to 600,000 men and women.
   Despite the rally, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld a Missouri
law imposing restrictions on abortion, inviting other states to do
the same.
   About 14 leaders from a dozen national pro-choice groups yelled
into microphones set up in LaFayette Park warnings to President Bush
and other elected officials who are against women having the right
to choose abortions.
   Bush, who praised the high court ruling, returned to the White
House after a five-day vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Mort Halperin, head of the American Civil Liberties, said, ``We
intend to make it clear to the president that he is personally
responsible ... as the leader of our country .. he is responsible
for understanding that his job is to protect our freedom and not to
take it away,'' Halperin said.

associate administrator of the Agriculture Department's Foreign
Agricultural Service.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Dickerson's 27 years
of marketing and trading experience in the United States and abroad
``makes him a natural to carry out the demanding duties'' of the
sales manager.
   Dickerson most recently was a consultant and marketing agent in
the Pacific Northwest, Yeutter said. From 1978 to 1986, he was
president and chief operating officer of Columbia Grain Co.,
Portland, Ore. Before that, beginning in 1967, he worked for Cook
Industries Inc., in Portland; Memphis, Tenn.; and Tokyo.
   From 1960 to 1967, Dickerson woarked for Cargill Inc., in
Chicago, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Portland, Ore.; and Mexico City. He
is a native of Inglewood, Calif.
   As the agency's general sales manager, Dickerson will be
responsible for administering foreign market development activities,
export credit programs and the Food for Peace aid program.

<HEAD>Pravda: Strike, Demonstrations Hurt Economy of Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the predominantly Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh have lost the equivalent of about $53.5 million in
wages because of a two-month general strike in the region, Pravda
said Wednesday.
   The newspaper also reported that Armenians continue to hold
illegal demonstrations that threaten to trigger more ethnic clashes
in the enclave.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an autonomous region within the republic of
Azerbaijan. The Armenian enclave is largely Christian but the rest
of the republic's residents mainly are Moslems, and ethnic tensions
in the region stem from the religious differences.
   The strike has cost Stepanakert, the autonomous region's capital,
about $38 million worth in manufactured goods, most of them intended
for the surrounding region, Pravda said.
   ``Industrial enterprises and construction projects, organizations
and institutions do not work,'' the newspaper said. ``Road transport
is partially idle.''
   It said the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains tense because
of continued demonstrations and rallies demanding that the Armenian
enclave be reunited with Armenia.
   ``Inter-ethnic conflicts in areas inhabited by Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, the disquieting situation on the roads, ill-considered
publications from both sides and unauthorized demonstrations and
rallies greatly complicate the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh,''
Pravda said.
   A commission on Nagorno-Karabakh established by the new Congress
of People's Deputies will review seven proposals for solving the
ethnic conflict, Soviet television news reported Wednesday.
   On May 9, authorities lengthened a curfew after ethnic clashes
between Armenians and Azerbaijanies. Authorities also have
established a special government committee to try to end the
violence.

<HEAD>China Cuts Off Satellite Reception in Hotels</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has ordered major hotels in the capital to
unhook satellite dishes that receive foreign news broadcasts,
including Cable News Network, hotel officials said Wednedsday.
   In addition to CNN, some hotels also receive the U.S. Armed
Forces Radio, Television Service and, in a few cases, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. Only the hotels that are partly owned by foreign
business concerns have satellite dishes.
   ``The Chinese hotels do not have this service,'' said an official
at Beijing's Travel and Tourism Bureau who identified himself as Sun.
   Anyone with a satellite dish can receive the programming, and the
hotels do not pay cable networks or the Chinese government for the
service. The tourism official, said satellite service was ordered
cut because it was unfair.
   ``Our guess is that they are concerned the hotel staff is seeing
it,'' said Vito Maggiolo, CNN's managing editor in Beijing.
   China is engaged in an intensive propaganda campaign to discredit
Western news accounts of a seven-week student movement for
democratic reform and a military crackdown on June 3-4. The Chinese
government has said up to 200 people, half of them soldiers, died in
the crackdown, while Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence
sources say the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   Sun said the order to cut cable reception was issued in January
by the State Bureau of Travel and Tourism and the Ministry of Radio,
Film and Television. But he said it was enforced only in the past
few days after the government realized hotels had not heeded the
first order.
   Beijing hotel officials said the government order was issued
about six months ago but that there had been no attempts to enforce
it.
   Hotels in Shanghai and Guangzhou said, however, they have not
been ordered to cut satellite reception.
   The Great Wall Sheraton was the first to cut its satellite
service last month. It restored the service briefly this week,
reportedly because it realized other hotels were still ignoring the
order, but cut it again less than 24 hours later.
   The Jiangguo Hotel, China's first joint-venture hotel, suspended
service on Friday, one day after CNN broadcast a videotape of
fugitive student leader Wu'er Kaixi saying from exile he would never
give up the struggle for democracy in China.
   The hotel issued a circular a few days later, saying that
technical difficulties were responsible for the loss of programming.
   At least four other Beijing hotels _ the Shangri-La, Palace,
Kunlun and Holiday Inn Lido _ also have cut satellite service.
   Questions and complaints from disappointed and angry hotel guests
elicited a variety of responses, ranging from blank looks to talk of
technical problems.
   ``We are upset about it. But what can we do? We have to accept
it. Everyone is in the same boat. We cannot fight it,'' a Jianguo
hotel official said on condition of anonymity.
   ``There is no way we can say no,'' said the manager of another
hotel. ``Our guests are angry. We can only tell them it is beyond
our control.''
   Sun said any hotels that still refuse to follow the order will
not be punished, but said that hotels in China should obey Chinese
law.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Education Association on Wednesday
called for systematic computer training for teachers and a computer
on every teacher's desk by 1991.
   An NEA technology report says teachers could devote more time to
teaching and less to paperwork if they were able to use computers to
record grades, keep attendance, schedule activities, develop tests,
generate worksheets and write letters to parents.
   The recommendations were part of a technology report issued on
the final day of the teacher union's annual conference. A rally to
show solidarity with Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators and a
speech by incoming president Keith Geiger also were featured.
   Geiger, who takes office at the end of the summer, reiterated his
intention to put collective bargaining high on the NEA agenda. He
said the NEA will use its clout and political expertise to support
any state affiliate that develops a realistic, long-term plan to win
such rights in the 14 states that don't have them.
   Geiger said collective bargaining has been ``too often blamed for
halting the pace of educational change.'' He contended it is ``a
pathway to progress'' that can be used to revamp curricula and
restructure schools as well as improve working conditions for
teachers.
   The 8,500 NEA delegates and several thousand others in attendance
held a brief indoor rally in support of the Chinese demonstrators in
Tianamen Square last month. They waved signs imprinted with ``China
_ Remember the Students'' and a sketch of the Statue of Liberty, and
swayed back and forth arm-in-arm to the strains of ``We Shall
Overcome.''
   Shenping Feng, a Princeton University graduate student and
executive director of the China Solidarity Committee, said the
Chinese people are living under a totalitarian regime that assigns
them jobs and homes, tells them what to think, how many children
they can have and when to have them.
   ``We want to speak freely,'' he said. ``We want to live without
fear. We want to walk without being followed, and now we don't want
to be executed (for participating in demonstrations). That's our
understanding of democracy.''
   NEA President Mary Futrell called on the Chinese government ``to
end its strategies of repression and its policies of reprisal'' and
exhorted the U.S. government ``to impose the most stringent
economic, military and political sanctions we can put together.''
   The technology report said technology used in the education
process should take into account students' different learning styles
and abilities, help students take more responsibility for their own
education, promote new approaches to learning and encourage
communications beyond school walls, the report said.
   Some ideas outlined in the report included computer pen-pals, art
history computer disks, videotape collections, oral histories,
electronic ``field trips,'' computerized speech therapy and music
composition, projects with students in other countries and satellite
discussions with leading international figures.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders took to the streets Wednesday to
kick off campaigns for nationwide elections. Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno, fighting scandal and new allegations of tax evasion, stayed at
party headquarters and promised reform.
   Analysts and much of Japan's media have predicted his Liberal
Democratic Party, which has governed Japan since the party was
formed in 1955, will suffer heavy losses in the July 23 elections
for half the seats in the upper house of Parliament.
   In a 15-minute speech, Uno promised reform and apologized for the
widespread Recruit influence-peddling scandal that tainted many
Liberal Democratic Party leaders and led to the resignation of his
predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, one month ago.
   But he told voters not to listen to those ``who would change
Japan's system ... and lead the nation to isolation from the
international community.''
   He was referring to opposition parties, which have been gaining
in local elections in the wake of the scandal and voter anger over a
3-month-old sales tax.
   Soon after becoming prime minister, Uno was accused of keeping
paid mistresses. He denied doing anything immoral.
   ``By breaking the Liberal Democrats' majority, the upcoming
elections will be a historic first step,'' said Socialist Chairwoman
Takako Doi.
   ``The current government is not valid in the eyes of the world,''
she told a rally in Nagoya, central Japan. ``Prime Minister Uno is
holding office only because all his party's executives' hands are
dirty.''
   The mass-circulation newspapers Asahi and Yomiuri reported Uno
misreported property holdings and underpaid his taxes by $7,000
between 1977 and 1985.
   The papers said Uno continued for several years to claim as a
rice paddy property he converted into a parking lot in 1977. The
reports said he was taxed at the lower rates for farmland.
   The Asahi report, based on public announcements of all Cabinet
ministers' assets Tuesday, also alleged he violated a government
regulation by acting as president of his family brewery for several
months while holding a Cabinet post.
   Meanwhile, a Liberal Democratic Party official, who asked not to
be further identified, said it was ``rare'' for the party president
not to go out stumping the first day of such a major campaign. He
said Uno had no plans to attend any support rallies in the near
future.
   ``The sex scandal has absolutely nothing to do with it,'' said
another official at the party's campaign headquarters. ``He is busy
preparing for the summit.''
   Uno is scheduled to attend the Paris summit of seven major
industrialized nations, beginning July 14.
   The Tokyo branch of the Liberal Democratic Party last week asked
Uno to keep away from the campaign for the Metropolitan Assembly,
fearing the mistress question could scare off support. He did, but
when votes were counted Monday, the party lost nearly one-third of
its 63 seats in the 128-member assembly, while the Socialists, the
No. 1 opposition party, tripled their strength to 36.
   Of the 126 seats being contested in the 252-seat upper house, the
Liberal Democrats hold 66, the Socialists 22, the Komeito (Clean
Government Party) 12, the Communists eight, minor parties 13 and
independents five.
   Before Takeshita's resignation, three Cabinet ministers were
forced to step down due to links to the Recruit Co., a publishing
conglomerate that allegedly doled out millions of dollars in
political donations and underpriced stock shares in exchange for
favors.
   Uno reiterated his support for the new sales tax, which the
Liberal Democrats forced through Parliament late last year, but said
he was willing to ``re-examine'' certain aspects.
   The Liberal Democrats hold a comfortable majority in the more
powerful lower house, where elections do not have to be held before
next year.

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday announced new
procedures for the first nationwide elections in 22 years _ and the
first to separate the kingdom from the West Bank since Jordan's
independence.
   In a statement broadcast with the election announcement, Prime
Minister Zeid Bin Shaker connected the new voting law with Jordan's
support of the PLO as representative of Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Government sources said the elections will take place Nov. 16,
but there was no official announcement of the date.
   Sources close to the prime minister said a ban will remain in
effect on political parties, which were outlawed after a coup
attempt in 1957.
   An Interior Ministry statement over official Radio Jordan said
the amended election law called for an 80-member Parliament elected
solely from Jordan.
   King Hussein issued a royal decree enacting the new law, which
modifies an election plan adopted in April that outlined a 72-member
Parliament.
   All previous parliaments since 1951, four years after
independence, were evenly split between West Bank Palestinian and
east bank Jordanian representatives because Jordan claimed both
banks of the Jordan River.
   No nationwide voting has been possible since 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank. A handful of district elections were held on
the east bank in 1984 to replace members who had died.
   Hussein suspended the old 60-member Parliament last year after
renouncing sovereignty over the West Bank in favor of the PLO.
   ``The Palestinian cause constitutes the heart of our commitments
and interests in all fields,'' Bin Shaker said in a prerecorded
radio statement.
   He said the elections ``should do all possible to purify (the
relationship) ... in accordance with our stable position to defend
the Palestinian people on their national soil and in considering the
Palestine Liberation Organization the legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.''
   In April, Hussein promised to call elections before the end of
the year after four days of rioting over price rises.
   Many political activists complained that the April election law
failed to distribute seats fairly according to population.
   The new law adds three seats for Amman, where most citizens of
Palestinian background are concentrated. But the capital district,
with roughly 40 percent of the country's 3 million people, still has
only 21 of the 80 seats.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Wednesday to bar the
Senate from beginning the impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge
Alcee L. Hastings of Miami next Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that he had no
jurisdiction to rule on Hastings' claims that the Senate procedure
for hearing the impeachment evidence violated due process.
   Hastings faces Senate trial on 17 articles of impeachment,
including allegations that he lied during his 1983 bribery trial,
which ended in his acquittal, and that he obstructed a corruption
investigation by disclosing wiretap information.
   The Miami jurist had sought an injunction to bar the proceeding
on the ground that appointment of a 12-member special impeachment
committee by the Senate violated his constitutional right to a trial
of the evidence by the full Senate.
   But Gesell said the Constitution gives the Senate the power to
devise the procedures for conducting impeachment trials.
   ``The Constitution simply does not specify in detail what is
required for the trial before the Senate,'' the judge said. ``Absent
evidence that the Senate is violating the Constitution, the court
should stay its hand.''
   He noted that the same committee procedure, with some
modificatins, was used in 1986 during the impeachment trial of
former U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada.
   Several senators voted against Claiborne's impeachment, saying
they objected to the committee procedure.
   But Gesell said that issue was for the Senate, not the courts, to
debate.
   ``It is not this court's function to tinker with the Senate's
procedures or to anticipate problems that could arise,'' Gesell
wrote. ``The procedures adopted do not by their terms violate any
constitutional rights or offend fundamental notions of justice.''
   Gesell also rejected Hastings' claims that he is a victim of
double jeopardy because the Senate is considering many of the same
charges for which he was acquitted during the criminal trial.
   But Gesell said Hastings' argument is based on a ``fundamental
misapprehension'' because ``impeachment is not a criminal
proceeding.''
   ``Impeachment proceedings are not restricted by principles of
double jeopardy any more than conviction always necessitates
impeachment,'' Gesell said.

   Presidents Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union
and Francois Mitterrand of France on Wednesday called for an
immediate truce in Lebanon and a halt to arms deliveries to Lebanese
groups involved in the conflict.
   In a statement issued at a joint news conference after two days
of talks, the two men said they were ``convinced that Lebanon must
remain sovereign, independent, united, with its territorial
integrity respected.''
   Gorbachev also indicated on Wednesday that he was prepared to
meet with leaders of Poland's Solidarity union movement and said the
Soviet Union would accept governments in the Soviet bloc that were
not dominated by the Communist Party. He said ``the right to free
election ... is of vital importance.''
   ``How the Polish and Hungarian people decide to structure their
society and their lives will be their affair,'' he said.
   The Gorbachev-Mitterrand statement on Lebanon supported Arab
League attempts to settle the civil war but also said their
countries were available to help with other efforts to reach a
peaceful settlement ``notably in the framework of the United Nations
Security Council.''
   France and the Soviet Union, together with the United States,
China and Britain, make up the five permanent members of the
Security Council.
   ``We are not going to take the place of those on the spot,''
Mitterrand said, referring to the continuing efforts of the Arab
League. ``But we're not going to leave things as they are, that is
clear.''
   Answering questions about President Bush's call for a withdrawal
of all Soviet troops from Poland, Gorbachev said Moscow and
Washington should avoid dealing in propaganda.
   ``We're trying to do business so as not to engage in
propaganda-type initiatives,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's comments on propaganda were not directly aimed at
Bush's appeal, although a simultaneous translation into English
provided at the news conference made it appear they had been.
   Gorbachev, making a three-day visit to France with his wife
Raisa, recalled dealing with Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan,
``when attempts were made to give us lessons, to make
prosecutorial-type accusations against us.''
   ``The idea is not to score propaganda points but to really
understand that we are coming out of a complex period of Cold War
encumbered with mistrust, confrontation and all of this has to be
gotten rid of. For this we have to be very wise and very
courageous,'' the Soviet president said.
   Bush, who visits Warsaw on Sunday, urged the Soviet Union to
withdraw military units it has stationed in Poland since the end of
World War II.
   On behalf of the NATO alliance, Bush called last month for
sweeping reductions in conventional forces in Europe that would cut
the number of U.S. and Soviet troops on the Continent to 275,000 for
each superpower.
   The Soviets would have to remove 325,000 men under the ceiling.
The Americans would have to cut only 30,000.
   During nearly 10 hours of talks over two days, Gorbachev and
Mitterrand discussed reducing conventional forces and signed 22
agreements covering cultural, scientific, business and military
cooperation.
   The statement on Lebanon ``called for an immediate cease-fire,
rigorously respected, as an indispensable condition for the
establishment of a constructive inter-Lebanese dialogue, aiming at
national reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded
on a balance of the interests of all Lebanese communities.''
   The 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon, a former French possession,
has pitted Christians against Moslems and Druse militias. Since the
latest outbreak of fighting in March, Druse forces and Syrian troops
in Lebanon have battled the Christian army of Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun
has demanded withdrawal of the Syrians, in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate.
   Moscow is the main arms supplier for Syria as well as Iraq, which
has been arming the Christian forces.
   Gorbachev told reporters he supported a decision by the Soviet
Writer's Union to publish Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag
Archipelago'' and hinted that the exiled Nobel literature laureate
may have his Soviet citizenship restored.
   On Wednesday morning, Gorbachev met with French intellectuals at
the Sorbonne and challenged them to help create a new, more peaceful
world.
   He said the new Soviet political and economic system he is
fashioning would be ``a fusion of socialism and democracy ... It's
more difficult than we thought at the beginning, but it's working.
The country is changing, rapidly and irreversibly.''

   The Hong Kong legislature Wednesday unanimously
urged Britain to offer refuge to the colony's people, who face
Communist Chinese rule in 1997.
   The Legislative Council adopted the motion despite London's
refusal to give the vast majority of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people
the right to live in Britain.
   Hong Kong residents have demanded that right since the Chinese
government used military force to crush a pro-democracy movement in
Beijing on June 3-4.
   Members of the Legislative Council said Britain was not doing
enough to restore confidence in the future of the colony, which
London returns to China in eight years. Much of their anger was over
the nationality issue.
   ``We must not allow Britain to wash her hands of Hong Kong,''
said Council member David Li. ``Britain must restore to the people
of Hong Kong their birthright as British subjects. The fight for the
right of abode is not over; it has just begun.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain returned home
Wednesday after a three-day visit to Hong Kong and told Parliament
in London that Hong Kong residents feared for their future because
of Beijing's crackdown on political dissent.
   ``It is of the first importance that the Chinese government take
early, tangible and sustained action to begin restoring confidence
in China's intentions towards Hong Kong. We shall be pressing them
strongly on this,'' he said.
   But Howe also reiterated Britain's stance against allowing Hong
Kong residents _ including the 3.25 million who hold British
passports _ the right to live in Britain after 1997.
   Britain has said it could not absorb the immigrants, an argument
rejected by Allen Lee, the Hong Kong Legislative Council's senior
member.
   ``We have stressed time and again that people of Hong Kong do not
want to leave this territory. All we want is the provision of an
escape route in case of need,'' he said.
   Lee also said proposals under which only certain groups in Hong
Kong could qualify for residency in Britain would not be in the
interest of the territory.
   The comments came in speeches on a motion that said, ``The
British government should urgently take adequate and appropriate
measures to ensure a safe and secure future for the people of Hong
Kong, including restoration of full British citizenship to British
subjects in Hong Kong.''
   The 56-member legislature adopted the motion by voice vote.
   The Legislative Council considers bills proposed by the colonial
administration and debates public policy. A majority of members are
government officials and appointees; the rest are chosen by special
interest groups.

<HEAD>New Ambassador's `No' to Communists Draws Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Peter Secchia says that in
Washington, at least, people are judged by their first 100 days in
office.
   But it took the Michigan businessman-turned-diplomat only 100
hours to draw fire by reiterating U.S. opposition to communist
participation in the Italian government.
   Christian Democratic Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned May 19 and
has since been trying to resurrect the same five-party coalition
that excludes the communists. With political parties maneuvering for
position, Secchia's statement opened up the floodgates for the
communists.
   Asked if any change was expected in U.S. policy toward the
Italian Communist Party, the ambassador replied that while that it
was up to the Italian people to decide, ``it is clearly our
preference that the communists not enter the government for a number
of reasons, specifically the positions taken on key strategic
issues.''
   He told a Monday news conference that unless that changed, he had
no intention of meeting with Achille Occhetto, Italy's Communist
Party chief who visited America in May but was not received by the
Bush administration.
   The Communist Party daily L'Unita, which described Secchia as an
industrialist promoted diplomat for financial reasons, called it his
``first diplomatic incident'' and published a series of attacks.
   ``He's like a Japanese soldier in the jungle, it seems he hasn't
understood that the cold war is over,'' L`Unita quoted independent
leftist deputy Franco Bassanini as saying.
   ``It's interference in the affairs of our country while there is
a delicate political crisis,'' said Renato Zangheri, the Communist
whip in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Asked about criticism of his appointment, Secchia said Monday,
``I ask you to give me a chance and judge my performance, and maybe
100 days from now we can meet again.''
   Secchia was restating longstanding U.S. policy that had been
reiterated by his predecessor, Maxwell Rabb, when Occhetto went to
the United States.
   The Communist Party has opposed NATO's deployment of cruise
missiles in Sicily and attacked a plan to transfer to southern Italy
a U.S. Air Force F-16 wing forced to leave Spain.

<HEAD>People in Oliver North's Hometown Feel He Was A `Fall Guy'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILMONT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in the rural village where Oliver
North grew up criticized his sentence Wednesday as too harsh, and
said the former White House aide was a ``fall guy'' for higher-ups.
   ``If he came to Philmont tomorrow, I'd give him a hero's
welcome,'' Mayor Phillip Mossman said after North was sentenced in
Washington to two years probation and a $150,000 fine for
Iran-Contra crimes.
   North, who could have been sent to prison for up to 10 years, was
also given suspended prison terms of three, two and one years for
his three felony convictions.
   Charles Havelka, a retired real estate agent whose son was a
friend of North, called the sentence ``ridiculous.''
   Havelka asserted that the former Marine lieutenant colonel was
``just an intermediary'' between then-President Reagan and then-Vice
President Bush and ``all the rest.''
   Havelka said he remembered young North as regular churchgoer, a
Boy Scout, and later as a Marine, and said he's sure North did no
wrong.
   ``If he's a patriotic American and he said he didn't do anything
wrong, then he didn't,'' Havelka said.
   North, a key figure in the scandal over the use of profits from
arms sales to Iran to illegally fund the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of Congress,
destroying or altering government documents and accepting a
gratuity, a security fence around his home.
   Public support in this village of fewer than 2,000 people about
30 miles south of Albany has been mostly on North's side since
congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra scandal in the spring of
1987.
   The hearings made North a hero to many Americans. Philmont even
held an Oliver North Day in August 1987 to show their support.
   The feeling that North was a patsy for higher-ups, especially
Reagan and Bush, seemed widespread in the village.
   At the sentencing, Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told North, ``As you
stand there now you're not the fall guy for this tragic breach of
the public trust.''
   Mossman, though, said North's sentence was too harsh, and that he
was a ``fall guy.''
   ``Don't tell me that Reagan and Bush didn't know what was going
on,'' Mossman said. ``They come out on national television and call
him a hero and the next day they fire him.''
   Sharon Johnson, a real estate broker, said North is ``not the
only one that should be in the position he is in.''
   She said Reagan and Bush are ``supposed to be fearless leaders;
they should have owned up.''
   Pat Near, a village clerk, admitted that hometown prejudices
might be coloring her judgment, but she remembered North as a nice
boy who grew into a fine man.
   ``I love my country very much and I was very saddened by what he
went through,'' Near said.
   ``What he did, he didn't do selfishly, he did it for his
country,'' Johnson added. ``Even if he wasn't from Philmont I'd have
the same feeling.''

   A senior leader of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah organization said Wednesday the abduction of foreigners in
Lebanon was inappropriate and ``not a good method.''
   Sheikh Subhi Tofaili, who heads Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, spoke in an interview with The
Associated Press in south Beirut.
   Hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the kidnappings.
But Western intelligence sources and and local reports frequently
described the Shiite Moslem faction as backing Islamic Jihad, the
umbrella organization for underground groups believed to be holding
most of the 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   ``We haven't practiced kidnapping because of our conviction it is
inappropriate,'' said Tofaili, who recently returned from a trip to
Tehran after the death of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``We do not believe the abduction is a good method.''
   But he made it plain that for now the party was not ready to
intervene to help secure the hostages' release ``because the ...
issue is political.''
   The hostages include nine Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for the AP. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Tofaili's statement came a week after Hezbollah spokesman Ibrahim
Amin said: ``It is possible that we might feel some acts might have
involved a very big mistake. But we have to face our mistakes in the
way that preserves and respects our society.''

   LOND0N (AP) _ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher swapped her
limousine for a river launch, and two royal parks were turned into
emergency parking lots after rail and bus workers went on strike
Wednesday for the third time in three weeks.
   Troops laid metal sheets on park lawns to protect the grass. Even
so, the owner of Hyde Park's exclusive horse stable complained that
drivers turned a 300-year-old riding path laid by King William of
Orange into a race track, causing serious damage.
   A one-day walkout by bus maintenance crews disrupted services on
the capital's red double-deckers, which carry 3.2 million people
daily. Trains and subways carry nearly 5 million.
   The government made wartime-like appeals to people to share cars
and bring them in only when strictly necessary.
   A windswept Mrs. Thatcher sped down the River Thames in a Port
Authority launch to open the new Design Museum at Butler's Wharf on
the river's south bank near Tower Bridge.
   ``I just think it's a tragedy the public are being put to all of
this trouble to get to work,'' she said.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon, who took a bus instead of his
official limousine to work, said: ``a lot of people have been making
superhuman efforts to get to work today in London and in other
cities.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's administration said it was prepared for what a
senior government source called ``a war of attrition'' with
increasingly militant unions.
   As the latest one-day strike hit, British Rail announced a record
$486 million profit, achieved despite reduced subsidies that
followed the government announcement it would sell the system to
private enterprise.
   British Rail said the profit was for reinvestment, not pay
increases.
   John Prescott, the transport spokesman for the opposition Labor
Party, declared: ``The government has to end its obsession with
privatization and the free market before congestion and overcrowding
reduce our transport system to total chaos.''
   Troops laid metal sheeting over grass in Hyde Park and Regent's
Park to provide 7,000 extra parking spaces for motorists who
normally would take public transportation to work.
   Richard Briggs, owner of the Hyde Park stable, said some
motorists damaged a riding path put down in 1689. ``I want to know
who's going to pay for it,'' he said.
   Huge traffic jams were reported in the morning and afternoon on
some routes, but hundreds of commuters walked, jogged or cycled to
work. Passenger ferries on the River Thames reported brisk business.
   The employers' Confederation of British Industry said the turnout
for work appeared slightly less than the estimated 75 percent of
Londoners who made it during the last strike on June 28.
   The 75,000-member National Union of Railwaymen has held weekly
one-day strikes to coincide with walkouts that began three months
ago by the London Underground's 10,500 employees.
   The railworkers, who want a 10 percent pay increase, have
rejected a 7 percent offer. The union also demands an end to a
management attempt to negotiate separately with different categories
of workers, weakening the national union's power to halt the system.
   The subway workers want a $101-a-week raise for operating trains
without a guard. Management has offered $47 plus 14 days extra
vacation, with the package tied to increased productivity.
   In mounting industrial unrest, the 17-union Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions announced Wednesday it will poll
workers at selected companies about holding indefinite strikes. The
federation, which covers 2 million workers, wants the 39-hour
working week cut to 35 hours.
   On Tuesday, a strike by the 500,000-member National Association
of Local Government Officers disrupted public services run by local
authorities, such as mortuaries and museums.

   The air force bombed Moslem guerrilla
positions around Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad on
Wednesday, and the insurgents fired at least seven rockets into the
capital, the government said.
   Mohamad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, also reported
army counterattacks around the provincial towns of Khost, Kandahar
and Herat, but gave no details.
   He said 53 people had killed in all the operations, including 37
rebels.
   Amani said nine people were killed by the rockets in Kabul. Two
exploded in a residential area about 1,000 yards from the
Continental Hotel.
   On Tuesday, the government claimed the insurgents were preparing
major assaults on Kabul and other cities.
   A statement by the Supreme Defense Council on Wednesday said the
army was countering a ``heinous plan'' by Pakistan to aid the
guerrillas at Jalalabad, which has been under siege since March 7.
   Amani said both air force and artillery units were involved in
the fighting at Jalalabad, an important provincial capital 75 miles
east of Kabul and 45 miles from the border with Pakistan.
   On a former government tree farm at Ghaziabad, 25 miles east of
Jalalabad, the guerrilla faction led by Younis Khalis released 40
Afghan soldiers on Wednesday.
   Guerrillas have been accused of killing prisoners, and insurgent
leaders fear that has made many soldiers reluctant to change sides,
even though the Afghan army's desertion rate is high.
   ``They are not convinced ... we will not shoot them,'' said Aoul
Gul, the commander holding Ghaziabad. He said the prisoners were
freed to ``counter propaganda that we are killing the people we
get.''
   Diplomatic sources and witnesses said Wednesday's air strikes
were the most intensive in weeks.
   Fighter-bombers were seen leaving Kabul and the nearby Baghram
air base in groups of two and three for the Paghman Mountains, a
guerrilla sanctuary northwest of the capital.
   Thirty to 35 aircraft took part in operations that began at dawn
and lasted about 90 minutes, witnesses reported.
   Some aircraft headed for Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad
is the capital. The assault on Jalalabad was the first major
guerrilla attack after the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from
Afghanistan was completed Feb. 15.
   Jalalabad, the country's fifth-largest city, is considered
strategically important because of its nearness to Pakistan, where
the main guerrilla groups are based. The United States and Pakistan
provide most of the support for the insurgents.
   The Soviet-sponsored government claims it broke the siege of
Jalalabad last month, but official Kabul radio has reported fighting
around the city for two weeks. It said shells and rockets fired into
residential areas Tuesday killed four people, including two
children, and wounded eight.
   On Tuesday, the government said insurgents planned simultaneous
``massive attacks'' on Kabul and other major cities in mid-July. It
asked the United Nations to intervene.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said: ``The grave consequences,
which will include bloodshed ... and destruction, will be shouldered
by the Pakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack.''
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan
when the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began in May 1988.

<HEAD>U.S. Wine Consumption Falls As Better Wines Boom, Exports Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in the nation's capital uncorked 6.2
gallons of wine apiece last year _ more than people in any state _
but Americans drank less wine than in 1987, an annual survey
reported Wednesday.
   Mississippi residents drank the least wine, at 17.6 ounces per
capita, according to a report in the trade publication Wines &amp; Vines.
   Including coolers, American adults drank about 3.2 gallons per
capita of wine last year, down from 3.4 gallons in 1987. Per capita
beer consumption in 1988 was 34.1 gallons, and distilled spirits,
2.21 gallons.
   Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi said the per capita decline
was principally among less expensive wines. ``However, for the fine
wines, we went up 10 to 15 percent. And that is true even for France
and Italy,'' he said.
   Mondavi, widely regarded as the nation's most influential
vintner, predicted consumption will increase again ``if the wine
industry wakes up. We have been asleep at the switch in telling the
story of wine to the world.''
   The survey, using statistics compiled by state and federal
agencies and California's Wine Institute, found that total U.S. wine
consumption dropped to 552.2 million gallons in 1988, 4.9 percent or
28.7 million gallons under the 1987 figure.
   Washington, D.C.'s wine consumption was 3.1 percent below its
1987 figure.
   The top five per capita wine consumers by rank and comparison
with 1987, after the District of Columbia, are Nevada, 4.8 gallons,
down 5.5 percent; California, 4.1 gallons, down 9.2 percent;
Vermont, 3.4 gallons, down 3.9 percent, and Washington state, 3.4
gallons, down 5 percent.
   The survey found the top five states in total wine consumption
were California, 118.1 million gallons; New York, 50.3 million;
Florida, 32.4 million; Texas, 26.8 million, and Illinois, 26.7
million.
   Sales of higher-priced premium varietal wines boomed but jug wine
sales fell off again. With the dollar weak against European
currencies, domestic wines posted an export record in 1988 and
imports declined again.
   Mondavi said even the generic wines _ the jug wines _ ``are
coming up in quality, following the lead of the finer premium
varietals.''
   The survey noted that while exports hit a record 11.9 million
gallons in 1987, last year's exports hit 16.9 million gallons or 3.5
percent of total sales.
   About 86 percent of all wine sold in this country last year was
white, blush or rose, with only 14 percent red wines.
   California produced 90.5 percent of all U.S. wine last year at
428.4 million gallons, a 9.6 percent rise over 1987. New York was
next with 5.7 percent of the total or 27.05 million gallons, down
15.9 percent for the same period. Forty-three states now have bonded
wineries.
   Of imported wines last year, Italy led with 43 percent, followed
by France at 27 percent; Spain, 9 percent; West Germany, 7 percent;
Portugal, 4 percent; and the balance, other countries.
   The star of the import market was champagne, despite a 6.1
percent drop last year to 13 million gallons. The survey described
the growth of the import sparkler market as ``remarkable,'' noting
that in 1979 champagne imports stood at only 4.5 million gallons.
   Domestic champagne production last year was 41.1 million gallons,
3.1 percent down from 1987.

<HEAD>Bush, at European Summit, Will Note Environmental Commitment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, anxious not to be overshadowed
by the European allies on tackling environmental problems, will
emphasize ``steady, long-term commitments'' to those issues during
next week's economic summit meeting in Paris, a top adviser said
Wednesday.
   Bush intends to discuss a variety of U.S. environmental concerns,
including atmospheric ozone depletion, ocean dumping, deforestation,
international air pollution and global warming, said William Reilly,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Without going into detail, Reilly said Bush will make specific
proposals, including in Hungary and Poland, which the president will
visit before the July 13-17 summit.
   Reily said the environment will take on an unprecedented priority
at the Paris sessions.
   ``There is even something of a race on by some of the economic
summit participants, leaders, to be the `greenest' of all on this
issue,'' Reilly told reporters. ``I would expect that our posture
will be one that emphasizes that restoring the environment is not a
sprinter's game; it's going to require steady, long-term commitments
to reverse accumulated environmental problems which have reached
very serious proportions in many parts of the world.''
   Reilly said that as Bush indicated in a May 31 speech in Mainz,
West Germany, the president will ``make some proposals on the
environment both in Poland and in Hungary'' and will show ``an
interest in making available to Eastern Europe ... some of the
benefits of U.S. experience.''
   Reilly would not elaborate on what those proposals would be or
whether they involved the economic incentives that Bush has promised
Hungary and Poland in response to their democratization reforms.
   In the Mainz speech, Bush said that the United States and Western
Europe should work together on environmental problems and extend ``a
hand to the East.''
   At that time, he said the West could offer ``technical training
and assistance in drafting laws and regulations and new
technologies'' for tackling environmental problems.
   The United States is expected to work against moves toward what
Reilly called a ``large, new United Nations bureacracy'' to oversee
air pollution rules.
   Such a U.N. role was envisioned in a pact signed by leaders from
24 nations in March at an ozone conference in Holland. The pact
asked the United Nations to police efforts to curtail
ozone-destroying chemicals and other air pollutants. French
President Francois Mitterand was among the signers.
   Reilly said that he did not expect the issue to dominate the
environmental talks, but said that discussion of ozone-depleting
chloroflourocarbons was expected to be a hot topic.
   He said he did not anticipate ``specific treaties'' or ``signed
ratified instruments'' on the environment to come from the summit.
   Reilly said the summit will more likely produce ``an affirmation
of the major issues on the environment, particularly those that
intersect importantly with economic development.''
   ``There is likely to be a focus on sustainable development and
perhaps what that means for the world environment.''

<HEAD>Opposition Rally Draws 10,000 in Burma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 Burmese attended a
pro-democracy rally held in defiance of martial law, and the
nation's military leader indicated the army was prepared to quell
further demonstrations.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said the crowd that gathered Wednesday in
the center of the city was the largest in Burma since the army
crushed pro-democracy protests in September.
   ``Defiance and confrontation are extremely dangerous in the
establishment of democracy. ... We (the army) have contingency plans
to handle any situation,'' the army commander, Gen. Saw Maung, told
a news conference.
   He said communists had infiltrated opposition political parties.
   The rally defied martial law regulations that forbid public
meetings of more than five people, but witnesses reported a subdued
army presence.
   Ma Theingi, personal secretary to opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Suu Kyi spoke at the
rally and reiterated demands for democratic change. Ms. Suu Kyi also
protested the harassment and arrest of opposition members.
   The spokeswoman said authorities on Tuesday arrested Win Tin, 60,
a member of the nine-man executive committee of the National League
for Democracy. About 1,000 league members have been arrested since
the military took power in September, she said.
   Saw Maung repeated the military's  league, is the most outspoken
critic of military rule.
   Confrontation has increased recently between the army and the
league, the largest opposition group to emerge from the uprising.
   In August and September, millions of people took the streets
across Burma demanding democracy and an end to years of one-party
rule and authoritarian repression. Thousands were killed before Saw
Maung's troops finally crushed protests on Sept. 18 and he took
control of the government.
   Many Burmese remain skeptical that the army will hand over power.

<HEAD>Firefighters Battle Several Lightning Blazes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wind-whipped forest fire sent smoke billowing 10,000 feet over
the Utah-Colorado border and forced officials to restrict air travel
Wednesday. Hundreds of firefighters battled lightning fires in two
other states.
   In Southern California, residents of an affluent neighborhood
devastated by a wildfire returned to their homes to survey the
damage and guard against looters. The fire destroyed 13 homes,
causing at least $4.3 million in damage.
   ``We were going to have a barbecue,'' said Tammy Wigington, who
lost a redwood deck and hot tub in the fire, though her home was
spared. ``But I guess we already had one.''
   The 1,500-acre fire in Hacienda Heights, a canyon about 20 miles
east of Los Angeles, was surrounded Tuesday and firefighters said
the cause remained under investigation.
   ``I can probably tell you it was man-made,'' Inspector John
Lenihan said. ``The last time we had spontaneous combustion on brush
was in the Old Testament.''
   Lightning was blamed for fires in Utah, Colorado and in the
Okefenokee Swamp along the Georgia-Florida border.
   A 7,000-acre blaze roared past fire lines in the Flume Canyon
Wilderness Study Area in eastern Utah and belched so much smoke that
the Federal Aviation Administration closed an airway in the area
about 80 miles west of Grand Junction, Colo.
   The fire burned less than one mile from two natural gas lines,
forcing Northwest Pipeline Co. to close the lines, said Mary Plumb
of the Bureau of Land Management's Moab District.
   The fire did not threaten structures, but it burned a $5,000
Bureau of Land Management radio repeater being used to fight the
blaze, Plumb said. It burned through sagebrush and old Douglas fir.
   ``We aren't sure of the damage because we haven't been able to
get to the scene yet,'' she said. ``It's in extremely rough country
with extreme fire danger. There's a drought out there, so it's just
a tinderbox.''
   More than 300 firefighters were called in to fight the blaze,
which authorities hope to contain by Monday.
   In Georgia, more than 100 firefighters from state and federal
agencies fought a 750-acre blaze in the Okefenokee Swamp with the
help of helicopters that dumped water on hot spots. The 425,000-acre
swamp has been left dry by below-normal rainfall and water levels.
   The fire burned in the southwestern part of Billy's Island, about
16 miles northeast of Fargo. Firefighters hoped to stop it from
spreading to other parts of the island, said John Oberheu, a
spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Atlanta.
   Swamp officials say fire sometimes benefits the swamp, especially
if it burns off dried peat that, if allowed to continue building up,
could turn parts of the Okefenokee into dry land.
   Firefighters had nearly contained a blaze that burned 1,800 acres
in northwest Colorado's steep, rocky terrain about 10 miles
southeast of the Dinosaur National Monument. The fire was sparked
June 29 by lightning.
   In Wyoming Bridger-Teton National Forest, authorities believe
fireworks may have caused a 1,300-acre blaze that ate through heavy
lodgepole pine, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Fred Kingwill said.
   ``We have fireworks fires most every year,'' he said.
   More than 100 firefighters were assisted by 12 smoke jumpers,
firefighters who parchuted into the fire area. Eight Forest Service
trucks with water pumps fought the fire from roadways, but Kingwill
said most of the firefighting was being done by hand.

<HEAD>World Rallies to Aid Philippines: $3.5 Billion a Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International benefactors rallied to support the
Philippines on Wednesday and promised to commit $3.5 billion to the
first year of an aid program for the young democracy.
   Japan, the biggest donor, announced a pledge of about $1 billion
in easy-term loans and grants and said it was considering a separate
loan of $600 million to help service the Philippines' $28 billion
foreign debt.
   The United States says it will add $200 million this year to its
previous commitment of $458.6 million.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community said it would roughly
triple its aid to the level of about $350 million a year.
   ``We are grateful for the positive and enthusiastic response of
the international community to this unique effort to help us,''
Roberto Villanueva, aid coordinator in the Philippines, said after a
three-day meeting of 20 countries and seven international
organizations.
   A statement issued by the World Bank, which organized the
meeting, said the donors ``complimented the (Manila) government on
the remarkable economic recovery achieved in the past three years
and endorsed the government's policy objectives as presented.''
   The aid commitment is double the level that resulted from the
last donors' meeting in 1987, the World Bank said.
   If carried through 1992, it would mean $14 billion to help
President Corazon Aquino's government deal with pervasive problems
of poverty, poor infrastructure and a foreign debt legacy left from
the 20-year authoritarian rule of Ferdinand Marcos.
   The United States, former ruler in the Philippines and now
possessor of major military bases there, originated the idea for the
Philippines Multilateral Aid Initiative. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said in Tokyo Tuesday it was ``critical to the future of
Philippine democracy.''
   The World Bank did not release details of other donors'
commitments, most of which would come from the bank itself or other
global institutions like the International Monetary Fund, said
Japanese analyst Katsumi Nozawa.
   Nozawa said that in addition to supporting democracy and economic
reform, the aid package would bolster Western strategic interests in
the Philippines. The current U.S.-Philippines agreement on key U.S.
air and naval bases there expires in late 1991.
   All sides officially say no link exists between aid and
continuation of the bases, but ``there is a de facto link,'' said
Nozawa, a Philippines specialist at the Institute for Developing
Economies, a think tank supported by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.
   The Philippines' 1989-92 economic recovery plan also coincides
with the end of Mrs. Aquino's term as president, Villanueva noted.
   He said no conditions were set on debt-relief measures, but he
acknowledged that Manila now must show improved performance in
utilizing aid, a concern that was stressed by Japanese, Americans
and others at the conference.
   Villanueva said a system of checks and balances was in place to
guard against corruption and mismanagement _ areas that long have
been problems in delivering aid to the Philippines.
   The Philippines' deputy finance Secretary, Ernest Leung, told
reporters work now could start soon on electric power and road
projects, and that the conference result would help back a fisheries
loan and give other fiscal support.
   Poverty now afflicts 49 percent of the people in the Philippines,
according to official standards. If the aid reduces poverty, it may
eventually lower the strength of the communist-led insurgents who
have fought for 20 years to overthrow the government.
   The 20 countries represented at the Tokyo meeting were Australia,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Finland, West Germany,
Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United States.
   International organizations included the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, the European Economic Community, the International
Monetary Fund, the U.N. Development Fund, the International Finance
Corporation and the U.N. International Cultural and Educational Fund.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretary-general of the
officially atheistic Soviet Communist Party, told reporters
Wednesday he had been baptized.
   ``I was baptized. I was christened, and I think this is quite
normal,'' the Soviet president said in response to a question at a
news conference.
   Despite the greater openness in the Soviet Union, much is still
not known about the 58-year-old Kremlin leader's past or personal
life. Such topics are generally off-limits to his country's
state-run media.
   During a visit to Britain in 1984, Gorbachev said that his
grandparents kept icons at home but that they kept them behind
portraits of Lenin and Stalin to hide them from authorities.
   Gorbachev has said his grandparents once took him to church but
that he felt no need to return after the first visit.
   Gorbachev's mother, Maria Panteleyevna, is said to attend a
Russian Orthodox Church not far from her home in Privolnoye, a rural
village in southern Russia where Gorbachev was born.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Net withdrawals from the nation's savings and
loans eased in May for the fourth consecutive month, the government
said Wednesday.
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, speaking on
the eve of the board's formal release of May figures for the
nation's 2,934 S&amp;Ls, said there was only a ``slight outflow'' of
deposits in May compared with a $5.4 billion exodus in April.
   Including interest credited to accounts, deposits for the month
rose slightly for the first time since December, Wall said.
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said three former
Dallas S&amp;L executives pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges of
insider abuse. A new indictment also was handed up Wednesday.
   The three executives are:
   _John H. Roberts Jr., former president of Summit Savings
Association of Dallas. Roberts used a nominee borrower to obtain a
$4.5 million loan from the institution to provide an airplane for
Roberts' use. He faces a maximum jail term of 10 years and a $15,000
fine.
   _Joseph R. Smith, former vice president at Sunbelt Savings
Association in Dallas, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud
the bank board and the IRS. He faces a maximum jail sentence of five
years and a fine up to $250,000.
   _Kenneth C. Hood, former vice presdient of Western Savings
Association in Dallas. He was charged with attempting to defraud the
IRS by creating artificial losses and by making a false statement in
connection with a $11.3 million loan from Sunbelt. He faces a
maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of $500,000.
   Indicted Wednesday was Bob R. Franks, former president of
Northpark Savings Association in Richardson, Texas.
   Franks is accused of illegally diverting $138,000 of Northpark
funds to make an interest payment on a $2.95 million loan from
Centennial Savings Association of Greenville, Texas. If convicted,
he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined up to
$500,000.
   Thornburgh attributed the three convictions, as well as the new
indictment, to the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.
   The task force, a joint effort of the Justice Department, the
bank board, the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, has brought
indictments against 50 people for S&amp;L or bank fraud and obtained 32
convictions in two years. More than 100 other people have been
convicted for bank or S&amp;L fraud under indictments sought by the U.S.
attorney's office in Dallas.
   However, Thornburgh said he opposed a provision in the House S&amp;L
bailout bill that would require the Justice Department to maintain
the task force in Dallas and establish a similar one in Southern
California, the two areas of the country with the biggest backlogs
of thrift fraud cases.
   ``What we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move our
resources where they are necessary,'' Thornburgh said.

   Three inmates at a Moscow prison took a female
guard hostage Wednesday, but she was freed a short time later by an
assault team, Tass said.
   ``An assault group performed a rescue operation with precision,
and made no mistakes,'' the official Soviet news agency said. It did
not give further details about the group.
   The team disarmed the criminals, who were threatening the woman
with crudely made knives, Tass said. The report did not say whether
shots were fired or whether anyone was hurt.
   The inmates were serving sentences for burglary, and the oldest
one was 18, Tass said. They grabbed the guard and threatened to kill
her if they were not freed and given a car, the news agency said.
   The inmates refused to negotiate, Tass said, so the assault team
went in 40 minutes after the standoff began at 11:20 a.m.
   Tass gave no other details.

   Leona Helmsley wrote off jade figurines worth
$500,000, an outdoor sound system patterned after one at Disney
World and other household purchases as business expenses to avoid
taxes, a prosecutor charged Wednesday.
   In opening arguments at her federal trial on tax evasion,
conspiracy and extortion charges, Mrs. Helmsley's attorney asked
jurors not to hold her personality against her.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, and her husband, Harry, head a $5 billion real
estate and hotel empire.
   The couple ``acted as if they were above the law,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita. ``They used their position in
society to evade one of the most important responsibilities ... to
pay their fair and accurate share of taxes.''
   Helmsley, 80, indicted in April 1988 with his wife, was dropped
as a defendant in the U.S. District Court trial after being found
mentally incompetent.
   Mrs. Helmsley is on trial with former Helmsley hotel executive
Frank Turco and Joseph Licari, who was a top aide to Harry Helmsley.
   DeVita said that in addition to charging the renovation of the
couple's Greenwich, Conn., mansion to Helmsley-controlled companies,
Mrs. Helmsley used her hotels and businesses as ``a personal piggy
bank'' for other purchases.
   He said these included everything from a $45,000 silver clock for
her husband ``right down to her shoes and underwear.''
   DeVita also detailed instances when Mrs. Helmsley yelled at
employees and had them fired if they did not not go along with the
scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley's attorney, Gerald Feffer, downplayed the charge
Mrs. Helmsley did not pay $1 million in federal taxes from 1983 to
1985. He said the Helmsleys paid $57.8 million in federal, state and
local taxes during that time.
   Feffer told the jury he would prove Helmsley companies were
entitled to pay part of the cost of renovating, decorating and
operating the mansion, which the Helmsleys bought for $11 million in
1983.
   Feffer also addressed the issue of Mrs. Helmsley's personality,
which he said would be a critical part of the case.
   ``They are going to try to get you to hate her by the end of the
trial,'' he said, adding that prosecutors would try to prejudice the
jury by giving details of the Helmsleys' extravagant lifestyle.
   ``In the United States we don't put people in jail for being
unpopular,'' Feffer said.
   He said Mrs. Helmsley has a ``mania'' for running the best hotels
in the world. ``If she should stumble on a speck of dust, or God
forbid, a roach in a hotel room, Mrs. Helmsley will blow up.''
   Mrs. Helsmley appears in national advertisements billing her as
the ``queen of the Helmsley Hotels.''
   During DeVita's arguments, Mrs. Helmsley shook her head ``no''
several times and her face became red. She jotted notes on a legal
pad.
   DeVita said the Helmsleys avoided paying for the estate's
renovation by submitting phony invoices and records to make it
appear the expenses were incurred by 19 companies in their empire.
   He said the cost of enclosing one of two swimming pools at the
mansion and installing a marble dance floor on its roof was $2
million, half of which was paid for by Helmsley companies.
   He said a sound system that piped music to a gazebo and barbecue
pit was installed after Mrs. Helmsley admired a similar one at
Disney World. DeVita called it ``a musical paradise underwritten in
part by Uncle Sam.''
   The two jade figurines, bought from a dealer for $500,000, were
charged to four hotels and listed on the invoices as antique
furniture, DeVita said.

   Complaints about mail-order and telephone-order
firms declined sharply in 1988, the Better Business Bureau
organization said Wednesday.
   According to data from the nation's 180 Better Business Bureaus,
``ordered product sales'' prompted 58,200 complaints compared with
68,500 the year before. This kind of complaint ranked third last
year but topped the list in 1987.
   The Council of Better Business Bureaus said its affiliates
recorded 65,900 complaints about retail stores last year, more than
any other category. This was about the same as the 68,500 the year
before when they were in second place.
   Non-auto service firms were the second-ranked source of
complaints in 1988 at 58,600 compared with 59,350 in 1987 when they
ranked third.
   ``I don't know of a specific action or a specific program, but
what I would suggest is there has been a renewed emphasis on
customer service'' by mail-order firms, said Connie Heatley, a
public relations executive with the New York-based Direct Marketing
Association in New York.
   She said big-name catalog companies such as Land's End and L.L.
Bean have led the way ``and everyone else is following'' in attempts
to improve customer service.
   Among retail stores, home furnishings accounted for the most
complaints, 12,500.
   In other categories, home improvement and remodeling companies
ranked fourth, receiving 46,000 complaints compared with 45,750 the
previous year. Auto, truck and recreational vehicle dealers were at
the bottom of the list both years, with 31,000 complaints in 1988
and 26,750 in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas wearing ski masks and carrying
pistols invaded a Mormon chapel in suburban Santiago and set fire to
an adjacent library before fleeing, police reported Wednesday.
   They said the Lautaro Movement, a small leftist rebel band,
claimed responsibility.
   Officers said the raiders, five men and two women, held 14 people
in the small temple at gunpoint late Tuesday and forced the Chilean
man preaching to them to undress before tossing a firebomb at the
library.
   The library was almost completely destroyed.
   The temple in La Florida, a working-class suburb south of
Santiago, was not damaged.
   Before fleeing, the raiders left a bomb, which was defused by
police.
   The government-controlled news agency Orbe called the attack the
work of political extremists.
   The Lautaro Movement takes its name from an Indian chief who
fought the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century.
   Several Mormon chapels were bombed in Santiago and other Chilean
cities last year. Leftist guerrillas claimed responsibility for
those attacks, calling the Mormon church a ``tool of American
imperialism.'' They noted that a number of American Mormon
missionaries were working in Chile.
   A Mormon spokesman said then that only a small number of
Americans were among the church's more than 200 missionaries working
throughout Chile.
   A spokeswoman for the Mormon church said Wednesday the church
would not comment on Tuesday's attack. She said, ``All we know is
what police have already told you.''

   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar
called in U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann on Wednesday to protest
a congressional amendment alleging human rights abuses against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
   The measure, adopted by the House of Representatives last week,
expresses concern over the state of human rights in Yugoslavia,
especially in Kosovo, where a state of emergency was introduced in
February to quell ethnic unrest.
   Loncar told Zimmermann the human rights situation here was shown
in a ``false and biased way,'' according to the state Tanjug news
agency. He reportedly told Zimmermann the amendment ``encourages
nationalist and separatist elements in Kosovo and is contrary to
American statements in support of the territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia.''
   The measure passed by the House was merely advisory. It stressed
that ``the United States continues to support the independence,
unity and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.''
   The measure was one of several amendments to the foreign aid bill
adopted on a voice vote with no objection June 28.
   Communist Yugoslavia has maintained close relations with the
United States since Belgrade's break with the Soviet bloc in 1948.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 85 percent of Kosovo's population. As a
province of Yugoslavia's republic of Serbia, Kosovo enjoyed broad
autonomy under the 1974 constitution. That autonomy was curbed when
control of police, judiciary and education passed to the Serbian
capital of Belgrade in March.
   Members of the Serbian minority in Kosovo claim they are being
driven out of their ancient heartland by harassment from ethnic
Albanians.
   Last March, protests by ethnic Albanians led to bloody clashes
with security forces in which at least 25 people died.

<HEAD>Panama Blocks Entrance to U.S. Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 150 Panamanian paramilitary
troopers blocked the entrance to a large U.S. Army base on Wednesday
to protest what they called ``lack of respect by the United States
for Panama.''
   No incidents occurred during the nearly one hour that members of
the so- called Dignity Battalion blocked the entrance to Fort
Clayton, home of Brig. Gen. Mark Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army
South.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. Army of
``provocations and intimidation'' through weekend military maneuvers
in civilian areas near the Panama Canal.
   Cisneros said he ordered the exercises and they would continue.
His forces are in charge of defending the canal.
   The development was the latest in the confrontation between
Washington and the government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges,
which he denies. The United States also accuses him of domestic
repression and considers him a possible threat to the canal.
   The Dignity Battalion was formed and trained by the Defense
Forces and is made up of civilians who support the forces and
Noriega.
   Its members, carrying Panamanian flags and chanting anti-American
slogans, stood blocking the access roads leading to the main gate of
the base.
   The group commander, Benjamin Colamarco, and others went to the
gate and delivered a letter to Provost Marshal Maj. Alan Mansfield.
   He urged them to clear the area because ``you are violating the
Panama Canal Treaties.''
   ``You do not represent an authority in Panama,'' Colamarco
replied.
   Mansfield then talked to Lt. Johnny Rivera, a Panamanian who is
the liaison officer with the U.S. Forces.
   Rivera told him he understood ``that they want a letter delivered
to Cisneros.''
   ``The letter has been delivered ,'' Mansfield said.
   Minutes later, the protesters left.
   Just inside the gate U.S. soldiers in riot gear stood ready to
intervene.
   The U.S. government says that under the Canal Treaties of 1977
signed by President Jimmy Carter and the late Panamanian dictator
Omar Torrijos, U.S. forces can travel freely on Panamanian roads and
carry out training exercises in designated areas near the canal to
prepare for their mission.

<HEAD>U.S. Labor Costs Rising Slower than in Most Competing Countries</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS two grafs to give all 12 percentage changes.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor costs rose more slowly last year in the
United States than in all but one of the nation's 11 major economic
competitors, the Labor Department said
   The rise in U.S. labor costs _ 0.3 percent from 1987 to 1988 _
was dwarfed by such increases as 17 percent in Taiwan and 11.2
percent in South Korea.
   Of the 11 competitors, only France bettered the U.S. performance,
recording a decline of 0.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
said.
   While American workers were still earning more than employees in
most of the other countries, the fall in the value of the dollar
meant that a Japanese worker was catching up fast to his U.S.
counterparts.
   The average Japanese worker cost the employer $13.14 an hour in
1988, a 10.5 percent increase over 1987. The average in the United
States was $13.90.
   In eight western European countries, the costs were already
higher than in the United States: $19.43 in Norway, for example, and
$18.07 in West Germany.
   In South Korea, however, the cost of an average hour's labor was
only $2.45 and, in Taiwan, $2.71.
   That is, an employer could hire more than five Taiwanese or South
Korean workers for the cost of hiring one American. This helps
explain why some factories have moved production lines out of the
United States to those Pacific Rim countries.
   Not all labor costs go to workers as wages. The Labor Department
figures include employer contributions to private plans and payroll
taxes for social services, such as pensions and health care, from
which workers benefit. These expenses are generally higher in
western Europe than in the United States, and higher in the United
States than in the countries on the Pacific rim.
   Here are the percentage changes for each of the 12 countries
surveyed _ increases for all but France. The bureau did not give the
1988 cost for an hour's labor in all. The increases are bases on
costs measured in dollars. Because of exchange-rate fluctuations,
the percentages might be different for costs measured in local
currencies.
   Taiwan, 17 percent; Britain, 11.8 percent; South Korea, 11.2
percent; Canada, 10.9 percent; Japan, 10.5 percent; Sweden, 7.9
percent; Denmark, 3.4 percent; Italy, 2.9 percent; West Germany, 1.8
percent; The Netherlands, 1 percent; the United States, 0.3 percent;
France, minus 0.8 percent.

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan is sore but in
excellent condition in the wake of a riding accident on a Mexican
ranch, the doctor who treated him said Wednesday through a
spokeswoman.
   Dr. Juan Lopez, who treated Reagan at Fort Huachuca here Tuesday
for scrapes and bruises, flew Wednesday into northern Mexico to
examine the former president, said Margaret Liebchen, a spokeswoman
at the post.
   Reagan, 78, an accomplished rider, was thrown by a bucking horse
Tuesday at a privately owned ranch near Cananea, about 30 miles
south of the Arizona border. He was flown by Army helicopter to
Raymond W. Bliss Army Community Hospital for tests, treatment and
observation.
   He was discharged about four hours later, after declining
suggestions by Lopez and other doctors that he stay overnight, and
he returned by helicopter to Mexico with his wife, Nancy, Secret
Service agents and the hospital's chief nurse, Lt. Col. Paul
Farineau, who returned to the post on Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Lopez said he had told Reagan to avoid stressful
exercise for the rest of the week.
   In Los Angeles, the president's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said
Tuesday the Reagans were staying at a ranch owned by William Wilson,
a friend and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

   The 6-year-old son of Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was
in good condition Wednesday following surgery to correct nerve
damage suffered in an automobile accident.
   Albert Gore III was hit by a car April 3 in Baltimore while going
with his father to the Baltimore Orioles baseball team's opening day
game against the Boston Red Sox.
   ``Albert is in wonderful spirits and our whole family is
encouraged by the results of today's operation and the prospects for
an excellent recovery,'' the senator said in a news release.
   David Kline of the Louisiana State University Medical Center
performed the surgery at Ochsner Foundation Hospital, Ochsner
spokesman Reggie Moody said.
   The three-hour surgery was to repair what doctors called a
stretch injury to a network of nerves in the child's shoulder. The
injury limited the boy's ability to move his right forearm, Moody
said.
   Gore, D-Tenn., and his wife Tipper are staying with their son
during his time in New Orleans. The boy is expected to remain
hospitalized through Friday.

<TEXT>
   Eleven sailors were rescued from floating
wooden planks after their cargo ship sank Wednesday in the Arabian
Sea, and at least three others drowned and one was missing, shipping
sources said.
   The freighter Rahimi, which flies the United Arab Emirates flag,
went down with hundreds of sheep that were being ferried from
Somalia to the Persian Gulf for the July 13 feast of Eid al-Adha,
said the shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Moslems slaughter sheep during the holiday in memory of prophet
Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son to God.
   The sources said the ship had a crew of 15 Pakistanis and
Somalians, and that seven were plucked from the sea by the Western
Friend, a Panamanian ship, after clinging for hours to wooden
planks. Another four were rescued a few hours later by the
Tonbridge, a British vessel, they said.
   The sailors were in good condition except for one, who was very
weak, said the sources.
   The Rahimi caught fire Tuesday night and started sinking about
125 miles south of Masira, the sources said.
   The cargo vessel was en route to the United Arab Emirates port of
Dubai. The vessel was gutted before it sank in the shark-infested
waters, the shipping sources said.
   They said bodies of three of the crewmen were found floating and
pulled from the water, but that a fourth sailor was unaccounted for.
He was last seen jumping from the deck of the Rahimi with a life
jacket on, said the sources. His life jacket was found in the sea,
they said.
   Oman's air force helped direct the rescue mission and was
searching for the missing sailor, the sources said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez will call a special
legislative session to take advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing states to place more restrictions on abortions, he
announced Wednesday.
   ``Now, we have to balance the rights of the unborn with the
rights of the mother,'' said the Republican governor, a staunch
abortion foe.
   The special session will come no later than a previously
scheduled legislative meeting in October to consider transportation
and growth management issues and could be sooner, Martinez said.
   ``I don't believe we ought to wait until 1990 to deal with a
difficult subject,'' Martinez said later in Tallahassee. ``It's not
something that's going to go away. It's something that must be dealt
with.''
   Martinez met Wednesday night with eight anti-abortion activists
and lawmakers.
   He said in Miami Beach that he was pleased that the Supreme
Court, in modifying the Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
abortions, also seemed to reinforce states' rights.
   Before the ruling, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson had said
abortion should be dealt with in a special session so that it
doesn't dominate next spring's regular session.
   Senate President Bob Crawford was on vacation and could not be
reached for comment, but an aide said lawmakers would not be able to
avoid the highly emotional topic.
   Under Florida law, abortions are allowed during the first six
months of a pregnancy but prohibited in the last three months unless
a doctor certifies that the abortion is necessary to protect the
mother's life. State Medicaid money can only be spent for an
abortion when the mother's life is threatened.
   Florida's parental consent law, which is not being enforced
because of a lawsuit pending, is one of the strictest abortion
standards in the country, U.S. Sen. Bob Graham said.
   That law requires unmarried minors to get permission from their
parents or a judge before having an abortion. Supporters of the law
contend it protects the fetus and the right of parents to supervise
their children.
   Several state legislators didn't need time to reach decisions
about Monday's Supreme Court ruling. Within hours of the high
court's ruling, state Rep. Tom Banjanin filed a bill that would
enact many of the restrictions the high court allowed.
   But the House and Senate committees most likely to consider
abortion legislation are chaired by pro-choice advocates who have
vowed to weaken restrictive measures before they reach the floor of
either chamber.
   State Sen. Eleanor Weinstock, chairman of the Senate Health and
Rehabilitative Services Committee, said she would try to kill any
legislation that would further restrict abortion.
   ``I am not supportive of any change in the law whatsoever,'' said
state Rep. Steve Press, chairman of the House HRS Committee. ``I am
firmly behind the Roe vs. Wade decision. I see no reason why the
state should get involved in changing that.''
   Charlene Carres, a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the abortion issue would make Martinez and legislators
vulnerable in the 1990 elections.
   ``Both sides are going to say to every member of the Legislature,
`You're either with us, or your against us,''' Carres said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Hank Williams' Illegitimate Daughter Can Inherit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The illegitimate daughter of the late
Hank Williams Sr. should share in the country music legacy of
lucrative songwriting royalties, the state Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday.
   The court, in a 5-2 decision, said Cathy Deupree Adkinson can
share in the income, interest and copyright royalties _ estimated to
be worth more than $500,000 a year _ from the time she filed her
initial claim on Aug. 5, 1985.
   The court said Mrs. Adkinson's interests were not properly
represented when Williams' estate was settled 21 years ago.
   ``For 35 years of her life, she's got the short end of the stick.
But in the last two weeks, she's won major victories,'' said her
attorney, David Cromwell Johnson of Birmingham.
   The Supreme Court ruling came one week after Mrs. Adkinson
reached an out-of-court settlement of her separate lawsuit seeking a
share of the $600,000 estate of her adopted mother in Mobile.
   Mary Deupree left her adopted daughter out of the will she wrote
in 1987 when dying with cancer. Mrs. Adkinson's attorneys claimed
Mrs. Deupree was a drug addict who was pressured by others to cut
out the adopted daughter.
   Ms. Adkinson of Washington, D.C., is a budding country music
singer whose stage name, Jett Williams, combines the names of her
father, the late country music entertainer, and her late mother,
Bobbie Jett, a Nashville, Tenn., secretary who lived with Hank
Williams Sr. in the summer of 1952.
   Johnson said his client was away from her home Wednesday and was
unaware of the ruling.
   He estimated the royalties from songs such as ``Your Cheatin'
Heart,'' ``Kowliga'' and ``I Saw the Light'' are worth ``at least a
half million a year and maybe close to a million a year.''
   Richard Frank, a Nashville attorney representing Williams'
publishers, said the ruling was complicated by an earlier federal
court ruling in New York that rejected Mrs. Adkinson's claim to a
share of the copyright royalties.
   Johnson said the case must go back to Montgomery County Circuit
Court for settlement, but anticipated Ms. Adkinson would get
one-third of the estate, which has been controlled by Williams' son
from his first marriage, country music entertainer Hank Williams Jr.
and the second wife of Williams Sr.
   Williams died on Jan. 1, 1953. His daughter was born five days
later and, because of an agreement the country singer had with Ms.
Jett, the child was raised by Williams' mother, Lillian Stone, until
her death on Feb. 26, 1955.
   Williams' sister, Irene Smith, had originally agreed to take the
child if something happened to Mrs. Stone, but changed her mind and
the child was placed for adoption by the state welfare agency, the
Supreme Court said..
   On April 23, 1959, the child, known as Cathy Yvonne Stone, was
adopted by George and Mary Deupree of Mobile, who, according to
court records, wanted to conceal her past and declined efforts by an
attorney to have the child involved in the settlement of her
father's estate in 1967-68.
   While a student at the University of Alabama, Mrs. Adkinson
became aware she might have a famous father. She started seeking
closed court records about her paternity.
   Hank Williams Jr. filed a lawsuit in 1985 to keep the court
records secret, prompting a long legal battle.
   Mrs. Adkinson won a lower court ruling that she was the daughter
of Hank Williams Sr., but the court said she could not inherit. The
Supreme Court reversed that part of the ruling, but said she could
inherit only from the time she made the complaint in 1985.

<HEAD>New Military Junta Sends Delegation For Talks With Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of Sudan's new military junta
Wednesday said he would send a military delegation to talk with
southern rebels who have waged a six-year war against the government.
   Late Tuesday, in a second peace overture since seizing power last
week, the 15-member military council decreed a one-month unilateral
cease-fire in the war with the People's Liberation Army and proposed
a general amnesty.
   The amnesty would apply to the 50,000-60,000 rebels who have
taken up arms against the government since the rebellion led by
turncoat army Col. John Garang began in three southern provinces.
   Bashir said that on Thursday a military delegation would be sent
to the rebels' southern headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for
talks with Garang.
   State-run television quoted Bashir as telling reporters his peace
measures proved his ``June revolution'' was serious in seeking a
paeceful settlement for the war.
   Also Wednesday, the junta agreed to allow relief operations to
continue in the south, the Sudan News Agency quoted Bashir as
telling an army rally in Gabal Awlia, south of this capital.
   Both sides stilled their guns in May and June in response to a
unilateral cease-fire proposed by Garang to allow the United Nations
to move 120,000 tons of relief supplies to the south to ward off
famine this summer.
   Despite Bashir's repeated peace vows, spokesmen for the Sudan
People's Liberation Army have refrained from comment, saying they
were closely watching developments in Khartoum.
   Residents of the capital city have expressed cautious approval of
the new military leadership, which has lowered the prices of basic
goods while cracking down on corruption.
   ``His crackdown on the black market is slowly working,'' said
Younis Abdallah, a taxi driver. ``There is bread and petroleum. Many
merchants are afraid of his threat to punish by execution those
found guilty of hoarding and black marketeering,'' said Abdallah.
   Soon after a military coup on Friday overthrew Prime Minister
Sadek Mahdi, Bashir issued decrees dissolving parliament, political
parties and trade and professional unions. He withdrew newspaper
licenses and arrested about 45 political figures and others
suspected of corruption.
   A barrel of cooking oil now sells for the equivalent to $12.5,
down from $28. A loaf of bread costs 1 cent, down from 4 cents, and
the government set the price of meat at $1.60-$2 a pound.
   But a nighttime curfew remained in effect in Khartoum.
   ``Many Sudanese are very simple people who just want to find
enough to eat,'' said a western diplomat on condition of anonymity.
``If they find bread and cooking oil, they are willing to give up
political parties and a hoard of daily newspapers.''
   Prime Minister Mahdi remains at large.
   Al-Ittihad newspaper in the United Arab Emirates reported a junta
member, Brig. Ibrahim Nayel as saying Mahdi had sent word asking for
a guarantee for personal safety before turning hismelf in.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas Wednesday bombed a
bus carrying sailors from a Soviet fishing fleet on shore leave in
Lima, injuring 20 seamen, police said.
   The 12-pound bomb exploded as the 49 fishermen were boarding the
bus after leaving a handicrafts store, according to police and
witnesses. Eight were in serious condition, with injuries and burns
on their lower bodies, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, but police said
it had the characteristics of an attack by the Shining Path, a
left-wing guerrilla group that has targeted Soviet diplomats and
citizens in the past.
   Police also blamed the rebels for the deaths of six people they
said were killed in three attacks Tuesday in the region around
Huancavelica, a mining town in the central Andes about 150 miles
southeast of Lima. Police said the dead included an engineer for the
state electrical company and two women traveling in his truck, a
village mayor, a peasant and his mother.
   Gen. Oswaldo Diaz Salvador, the Lima police chief, said two young
men were seen placing a package under the bus carrying the Soviets
and then racing off as the bomb exploded. He said the police were
seeking four people in connection with the bombing.
   Two smaller buses, each carrying 35 Soviet fishermen, were
damaged by the mid-morning explosion, police said. But all of the
injured were on the larger bus. A group of 66 Soviets had just left
the area to sightsee in downtown Lima.
   The buses are owned by a tourism service company.
   The explosion also damaged the three-story building where the
fishermen had been shopping at a store that caters exclusively to
Soviets.
   An agreement between Peru and the Soviet Union allows 20 Soviet
trawlers to fish in Peruvian waters in exchange for a percentage of
the catch. The fleet uses the port of Callao, five miles west of
Lima, as a resupply point.
   When their vessels are in port, the fishermen often take shopping
trips, and a number of stores have opened that cater exclusively to
the Russian-speaking clients.
   On June 3, Shining Path guerrillas blew up a bus carrying palace
guards to a ceremony in downtown Lima, killing six people.
   In 1986, a Shining Path guerrilla was killed when the bomb he
carried after breaking into the grounds of the Soviet embassy
exploded. Also in 1986, Soviet fishermen were injured when a bomb
went off in a store in Callao.
   The Shining Path, which follows the ideology of Mao Tse-tung,
views the Soviet government as a traitor to Marxist theory. It
regards the Soviets as enemies because they have been a major
supplier of arms to Peru for the past two decades.
   The Shining Path has been fighting to topple Peru's elected
government since 1980. More than 15,000 people, including police,
soldiers, rebels and civilians, have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Murillo Record at Old Masters Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A painting of the Virgin and Child by the 17th
century Spanish artist Bartolome Esteban Murillo sold for $2.7
million to a Japanese dealer Wednesday, Sotheby's said.
   ``The Virgin of the Swaddling Clothes'' fetched an auction record
for Murillo.
   The buyer was Umeda Art Boeki of Osaka. The seller was not
identified.
   The painting is reputed to have been bought in a street opposite
Seville Cathedral in 1819 and it once belonged to Louis Philippe,
the French king who abdicated in the 1848 revolution.
   Murillo has been regarded for many years as too sentimental for
modern taste.
   The painting was in an old masters sale that brought nearly $23
million for 83 paintings.
   ``That's a lot for an old masters sale after the dominance of the
market by Impressionists and modern masters,'' said Fiona Ford, the
auctioneers' spokeswoman.

   A military judge on Wednesday
ordered a bad conduct discharge and suspended sentence for a Navy
deserter who led a normal life for two decades without revealing his
past.
   ``I couldn't ask for anything more,'' said Charles Smith, 43, a
seaman apprentice who walked away from his post at Treasure Island
in September 1969 after being ordered to report to an Alaskan
outpost.
   Although it was the Vietnam era, Smith said it was a marriage
gone sour and resentment of authority rather than politics that made
him desert. ``They gave me a lot of harassment,'' Smith said his
18-month tour. ``We're even now.''
   Smith, who pleaded guilty during his court-martial, was sentenced
to four months in the brig, suspended; reduced to the lowest rank;
and ordered to forfeit $1,000 in Navy pay.
   If he does not violate any laws for a year, the brig time will be
lifted.
   Smith, who kept his name and lived less than 10 miles from the
base during his desertion, was among the longest of the Navy's
recent cases.
   Because of a new enforcement program, desertions dropped from
14,000 in 1987 to 2,485, said Lt. Cmdr. Kaye Roberts, head of the
Navy Deserter Apprehension Program in Washington D.C.
   Smith faced up to one year for desertion, life imprisonment for
unauthorized absence and two years for using marijuana, detected by
urinalysis after his May 3 surrender, said his attorney, Howard
DeNike of San Francisco.
   Prosecutor Lt. Dennis Hoffman portrayed Smith as a ``problem
child'' who never grew up, but Smith's employer and the pastor of
his church testified he was a dependable worker and family man.
   Community groups and his current wife, Mary, who said she knew
nothing of the desertion, gathered 600 signatures from Smith's
friends, business associates and others asking that Smith get only
an administrative discharge.
   Mary Smith said she was ``overwhelmed'' by the sentence and
called it ``especially important when you've had somebody who's been
a constructive member of society.''
   Smith even garnered support from a veterans organization with
members from every U.S. war and major conflict since the 1930s. The
group asked the military to grant Smith clemency.
   Smith turned himself after getting a 5 a.m call from Navy
investigators, who tracked him through a routine credit check. After
several days in the brig, Smith has reported daily to Treasure
Island for duty on a maintenance unit.
   He is likely to be placed on leave without pay within a few weeks
and then discharged. That means the government probably won't get
the $1,000 he was ordered to forfeit, because it was to be taken out
of his next four monthly paychecks.
   In a previous interview, Smith said he had considered turning
himself in several times. ``But it was hard; I had a new life _
wife, kids, and I couldn't risk that.''
   ``I didn't want to hide,'' he said. ``I just wanted to put
everything behind me and get on with my life.''
   Smith's desertion meant he severed ties with his first wife, a
son, his parents and a sister, who at the time lived in Ohio. He has
not talked to them since and never obtained a divorce from his first
wife.
   DeNike said Smith deserted because he believed his first wife was
unfaithful and because he resented the rigidity of military life.
Smith enlisted in March 1968, and left the service without
permission twice before his final desertion.
   He remarried in 1975, had five children, bought a suburban house
in San Pablo and became active in the local Episcopal church. He
also worked 12 years as a manager at Kardum Paint Co. of San
Francisco, where he earned $24,000 yearly. Smith has been earning
$750 a month at his Navy job.
   DeNike said he assumes Smith's first wife either annulled the
marriage or received a divorce.
   Because he left during what the military technically considered
wartime, there is no statute of limitations to the charges. Congress
never declared war in the Vietnam conflict, but the military
previously ruled in desertion cases that wartime laws apply, said
DeNike.
   The record for Navy deserters who turned themselves in belongs to
a now-deceased sailor who jumped ship in 1926 and turned himself in
to Navy authorities last year, said Lt. Cmdr. Roberts, who would not
reveal the man's identity.
   The longest unresolved desertion case involves a sailor who left
his base in 1962, she added.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Indian Activist After Altercation with BIA Official</HEAD>

   Indian activist Russell Means was
arrested by police Wednesday after saying he was going to make a
citizen's arrest of a Bureau of Indian Affairs official and
wrestling that man to the floor.
   Means was pulled off BIA Navajo Office Area Director James
Stevens by BIA and tribal police in the room where Stevens had been
meeting with supporters of suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald.
   Tribal Police Chief George John said Means was arrested and
accused of assault and battery on Stevens. Means would appear
Thursday before a judge, John said.
   Stevens told The Associated Press later by telephone that he
planned to press charges against Means. ``Other than a few scratches
and a torn shirt, I'm OK,'' Stevens said.
   Means, a leader of the American Indian Movement, is a Lakota
Sioux from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. He married a
Navajo woman three years ago and has lived in Chinle on the Navajo
Reservation for about a year.
   Stevens had agreed to meet Wednesday afternoon with Means and
seven other MacDonald supporters. Means and about 60 MacDonald
supporters, members of a group called Pro-Dine Voters, marched on
the federal building in Gallup, N.M., Wednesday morning. ``Dine'' is
Navajo for ``the people.''
   The altercation occured about 30 minutes into the meeting which
began with MacDonald supporters questioning Stevens on his actions
and the Navajo Tribal Council's having put MacDonald on paid
administrative leave.
   Stevens, a San Carlos Apache transferred to the Navajo
reservation on Nov. 14, denied he'd interfered in Navajo affairs and
said he had followed decisions of a majority of the Navajo Tribal
Council and of the Navajo Supreme Court.
   Means was involved in a 1972 takeover of BIA offices in
Washington. He was also present a year later when AIM held off
federal agents and national guardsmen during a seizure of Wounded
Knee in South Dakota.
   A majority of the Tribal Council voted in February to place
MacDonald on leave after a U.S. Senate subcommittee heard testimony
alleging he took kickbacks on tribal contracts and profited from a
tribal land purchase.
   MacDonald was re-elected tribal chairman in 1986, four years
after he lost a bid for a fourth straight term. Tribal finances
under his latest chairmanship have been the subject of a federal
grand jury investigation in Phoenix.

   A Taiwanese man was convicted Wednesday
of fatally shooting two federal drug agents and wounding a third
during an undercover heroin deal that turned into an attempted
robbery.
   The Superior Court jury deliberated for four days before finding
Wei Wen Wang guilty of murder, attempted murder and robbery in the
deaths of Drug Enforcement Administration agents Paul Seema and
George Montoya.
   Wang could also face the death penalty at his sentencing because
the jury found the special circumstances of murder during a robbery
and multiple murder. The penalty phase of his trial begins July 24.
   Seema, 52, and Montoya, 34, were shot to death when they were
double-crossed by Wang and his alleged associates during a February
1988 drug deal staged as part of an undercover operation,
authorities said.
   DEA agent Jose Martinez, 24, was wounded in the shooting, and two
of Wang's associates were killed in a subsequent shootout with
agents and police.
   A third man, Su Re ``Michael'' Chia, 21, has been convicted of
murder and attempted murder and sentenced to 61 years in prison.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven D. Clymer portrayed Wang as the
trigger-man in the attack, but defense attorney Morton Philip
Borenstein said that Wang had thought he was involved with dangerous
drug dealers, not federal agents.
   Seema, a 14-year DEA agent, was posing as a drug dealer when he
arranged to buy two pounds of heroin for $80,000 from Wen Huei Kow
for Montoya and Martinez, who were posing as buyers, authorities
alleged.
   Kow rode with the agents in their car to a home where the sale
was supposed to be made, but the agents were told to pull over on a
Pasadena street where they came under fire from Kow and Wang,
authorities alleged.
   Kow and Michael Sun, another man allegedly at the scene of the
shooting, were killed in the shootout that followed. Authorities say
Chia delivered one of the murder weapons the night before and knew
about the robbery plan.

   The opposition celebrated its first victory in
a governor's race after the Institutional Revolutionary Party
conceded defeat in Baja California, but said Wednesday the ruling
party was trying to cheat elsewhere.
   The party, known as the PRI for its Spanish initials, has
controlled the federal and state governments since its founding in
1929 and had never conceded the loss of a gubernatorial election.
   Because of election fraud charges leveled against the PRI for
decades, even its opponents said the party may have won more by
losing in Baja, one of five states that voted Sunday, than it would
have gained through victory.
   ``This brings change to the socio-political reality not only in
Baja California but in all of Mexico because it inspires confidence
in their officials,'' said Ernesto Ruffo, who won the governorship
for the National Action Party, known by its initials PAN.
   Ruffo said from his hometown of Ensenada his victory was ``a step
toward greater citizen participation in public decisions,'' but PAN
president Luis H. Alvarez said the PRI was trying to cheat in the
state legislature.
   He said Ruffo cannot govern ``encircled, surrounded and pressured
by an illegitimate legislature controlled by the PRI.'' Alvarez
addressed a rally outside the federal Senate building in Mexico City.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was inaugurated Dec. 1 with a
weak mandate because of his narrow victory in an election marred by
fraud.
   He won respect with efforts to revive the economy and fight
endemic fraud and corruption, but many viewed Sunday's state
elections as a test of his intentions.
   A Mexico City shopkeeper who voted against Salinas last year said
he was impressed by the president's performance and was willing to
go back to the PRI, but only if it lost Baja, a PAN stronghold.
   PRI officials claimed victory for candidate Margarita Ortega
after the polls closed Sunday night, but appeared to back off in
succeeding days. Party chairman Luis Donaldo Colosio announced the
concession late Tuesday and official results are expected Sunday.
   ``It marks the beginning of a new step in the political life of
the country,'' a presidential spokeswoman said Wednesday, speaking
privately.
   PAN figures showed Ruffo winning by 204,690 votes to 151,099,
with ballots from 1,073 of the 1,168 polling booths counted.
   The well-organized conservative party made a major effort in
Baja, where there is less opportunity for fraud at isolated
countryside polling stations because most people live in a few
cities near the U.S. border.
   Party representatives obtained the official counts for most
voting stations and roving squads of poll watchers were sent to
trouble spots by radio.
   Crowds of PAN supporters waving banners and beeping car horns
celebrated into the morning hours in the Baja California cities of
Mexicali, Tijuana and Ensenada, where Ruffo served as mayor.
   The PRI was claiming mayoral victories in Tijuana, Mexicali and
Tecate, and a narrow majority in the state legislature. It said
there were voting irregularities on both sides, but not serious
enough to affect the results.
   ``We'll have to learn how to live together in a new political
relationship,'' a federal government official said privately. ``They
have to learn how to govern; we have to learn how to share power.''
   PAN and the Salinas administration have similar positions on many
issues. Both are strongly against corruption and support free market
economics.
   In Michoacan, a western state, the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party claimed it was being cheated of victory in state
assembly elections. Colosio, the PRI chairman, said his party was
leading in 11 of 18 assembly districts.
   Ricardo Pascoe Pierce, a spokesman for the leftist party, said:
``If they respect the vote in Baja California and not in Michoacan,
the PRI would be trying to divide the opposition as well as the
nation's hope for democracy,'' PRI candidates won handily in state
legislative elections in Campeche and Zacatecas. The party claimed
victory in Chihuahua, but the PAN disputed that.
   Gubernatorial, legislative and municipal elections were held in
Baja, legislative and municipal in Chihuahua, and legislative in
Michoacan, Zacatecas and Campeche.
   Most newspapers hailed the PRI concession in Baja California,
including the usually unsympathetic La Jornada.
   After saying, ``We shouldn't applaud someone who simply complies
with a duty dictated by the rules of competitive democracy,'' La
Jornada added that the PRI came out ahead because the defeat was
such a contrast to its reputation for fraud.

<HEAD>Cuomo Says He Still Opposes Removing Medicaid Funding for Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, saying the U.S. Supreme
Court follows a ``lower standard,'' promised his continued support
Wednesday for Medicaid funding in New York to pay for poor women's
abortions.
   Thus far, efforts to eliminate such abortion funding from New
York's state budgets have failed.
   Democrat Cuomo, a Roman Catholic, said nothing in the court's
Monday decision ``changes my opinion about the right to abortion or
the right of poor people to receive funding.''
   It was Cuomo's first statement on the Supreme Court's ruling on
the Missouri case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, where the
divided top court upheld Missouri's attempt to place more
restrictions on abortions.
   New York state's abortion law, one of the most liberal in the
country, allows abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and
after that if a woman's life is in danger.
   Despite personally opposing abortion, Cuomo has included in his
budget each year Medicaid funds that can be used by poor women to
pay for abortions. Cuomo, who's said poor women shouldn't be denied
abortions that others can pay for, said he'll continue the practice
in his 1990 budget proposal.
   ``In this case, as in the case of the death penalty where the
Supreme Court would allow us to execute children and the mentally
retarded, we in New York will choose what we believe to be a higher
and better way,'' Cuomo said in a statement distributed by aides.
   Cuomo said he will ``oppose the inevitable attempt by some
legislators to deny fairness to poor people because the Supreme
Court follows a lower standard.''
   Cuomo also said he'd oppose any attempts to put any other
limitations enumerated in the Webster decision into state law, such
as a prohibition against abortions being held in public hospitals.
   But he would not say how he would act if presented with a bill
requiring parental consent if minors seek abortions.
   The governor said both the strongest Supreme Court supporter of
the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, Justice Harry
Blackmun, and the most outspoken critic, Justice Antonin Scalia,
both said the Webster decision breaks no legal ground.
   Anti-abortion lawmakers in both the Republican-controlled Senate
and Democratic-controlled Assembly already have said they will
attempt again next year to remove Medicaid funding from the budget.
Such moves have repeatedly failed in the past.

   Taking seats beside their former Communist

historic moment and immediately took the government to task for
mishandling the economy.
   Not only did the free trade union movement claim the spoils of
its June election victory on Tuesday. It also saw the discredited
government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski formally resign.
   In his first speech as a deputy, Solidarity veteran Jacek Kuron
lashed into Rakowski for helping precipitate an economic crisis in
which the government's ``chaotic policy caused only social unrest.''
   Rakowski looked on uncomfortably from a balcony.

   Abortion-rights activists clashed with police in Boston and
burned a flag-draped effigy of a justice in Atlanta during
demonstrations against the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing
states to restrict abortion.
   Pro-choice protesters who burned an American flag in Minneapolis
were attacked by three waiters from a topless bar. One man was
arrested and several protesters suffered bruises and abrasions,
police said.
   On a day when Americans celebrated their liberty, thousands of
people in at least eight cities heard July Fourth calls to safeguard
abortion rights.
   Counterdemonstrations were held in two cities, but the
anti-abortionists were vastly outnumbered. The rallies came two days
after the high court upheld a Missouri law imposing restrictions on
abortion, inviting other states to do the same.

   Not a single family benefited during the first
10 years of a $134 million U.S.-Egyptian program to provide housing
for low-income people near Cairo, according to the Agency for
International Development.
   A new report to Congress by AID Inspector General Herbert L.
Beckington complains about U.S. aid operations in Egypt. At $2.3
billion a year, Egypt gets more U.S. aid than any country except
Israel.
   The project begun in 1978 at Helwan, about 18 miles south of
Cairo, was to cost $160 million, shared equally by the two
governments. By March 31, 1988, the United States had spent $71
million and Egypt $63 million and not one family had occupied an
apartment, the report said.
   John Riddle, a spokesman for the agency, said that since
Beckington's report was written, 205 families have moved into 158
apartment units. The project had been planned to include 4,000 units.

   Residents returned to their

13 homes and caused an estimated $4.3 million in damage wasn't more
devastating.
   Firefighters declared the blaze contained Tuesday afternoon after
completing a line around the smouldering hills, said Los Angeles
County Fire Department spokesman Joe Silva.
   But as firefighters were released from that blaze, about 200
others were dispatched to the San Bernardino National Forest to
battle a 150-acre blaze in Santa Ana Canyon, 70 miles east of Los
Angeles. Smaller fires flared throughout the region, but were
quickly controlled.
   Elsewhere, crews battled forest and brush fires in mostly remote

<HEAD>Milovan Djilas, the Yugoslav Dissident, Is Speaking Out Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A non-person for 35 years, Milovan
Djilas, Yugoslavia's best-known dissident, is freely speaking his
mind again, claiming the nation's communist system is a failure and
calling for a multiparty democracy.
   Such views once landed him in prison for nine years.
   Now, interviews with the 78-year-old former vice president are
published in widely read magazines and other publications.
   The official Communist Party newspaper, Borba, has carried
Djilas' interviews in several installments. Ironically, it was his
writing in Borba in the early 1950s that led to his expulsion from
the party and banishment from public life.
   Calls are growing for the rehabilitation of other prominent
figures, such as former secret police chief Aleksandar Rankovic, who
also was purged by President Josip Broz Tito during his unchallenged
rule from 1945 until his death in May 1980.
   Yugoslavia is now reappraising some of Tito's policies and trying
to shake off the legacy of the man who built one of the strongest
personality cults of the communist world.
   Since Tito's death, the feeling has grown among Yugoslavs that
most of the country's deep economic and political problems took root
during his rule. Yugoslavia has a $19.1 billion foreign debt, a
650-percent inflation rate and 17-percent unemployment.
   There is little doubt that calls for the rehabilitation of Djilas
and others are thinly disguised attempts to discredit some of Tito's
policies.
   The weekly newsmagazine Danas of Zagreb titled its June 6 cover
story ``The Second Death of Josip Broz.''
   ``As we approach the 10th anniversary of Tito's passing away, the
entire country is going through the drama of his second death,'' the
story said.
   The magazine quoted Slavoj Zizek, a Slovenian philosopher, as
saying: ``We have to distinguish between Tito's physical death and
the symbolic death of Tito's political being. What's happening today
is the end of Tito's Yugoslavia.''
   Tito left Yugoslavia with a highly decentralized system of
collective leadership with diluted responsibilities. The presidency,
for example, rotates among leaders of its six people's republics.
   Yugoslavia's ``democratic and economic development largely
depends on our ability to free ourselves from the Tito cult,''
Djilas said in an interview with the Belgrade weekly NIN in May.
   ``If Tito's reign had been shorter, there would have been much
fewer doubts cast on his merits.''
   Before his fall, Djilas had been Tito's heir apparent. Djilas
says Tito certainly had historic merits, such as steering Yugoslavia
away from the Soviet bloc. But he maintained that the country's
political and economic system has failed.
   ``Titoism has failed,'' Djilas said in a recent interview with
The Associated Press ``The only problem is how to proclaim it's
finished.''
   Speaking about his own rehabilitation, he said it was ``a symptom
of the end of Titoism, or it's even better to say the end of
Leninist and Stalinist models of politics and economy.''
   Djilas' disillusionment with communism made him the godfather of
Eastern European dissidents. His best-known book, ``The New Class,''
exposed the abuse of power by communist leaders. It was published in
the West but never in Yugoslavia.

   Her wavy, brown hair tucked under an
olive drab helmet, Cpl. Tami pressed her ears and winced at the
detonation of a small plastic explosive she had rigged moments
earlier.
   The 19-year-old soldier is one of scores of women who are being
trained to take over army jobs that had once been reserved for men.
Army commanders say the objective is to free more men for duty in
fighting the Palestinian uprising that began 18 months ago.
   Israeli women, who according to foreign estimates make up about
one-quarter of the army's 130,000 regular soldiers, have served in
the armed forces since Israel's beginning.
   Women are drafted at age 18 for two years duty while men serve
three years and remain in the reserves until age 49. Women are
banned from combat duty and have been serving as typists, clerks and
telephone operators.
   A change has come about, however, as more and more soldiers are
being assigned riot-control duties to confront the uprising in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Commanders estimate hundreds of women are being trained in combat
techniques to become instructors of males in such areas as
sharpshooting, the use of explosives, chemical warfare and driving
tanks.
   Some women also serve in the occupied territories as
behind-the-lines operations officers or non-commissioned staff who
help coordinate military actions and occasionally go on patrol.
   ``It is part of a change in our society. There is now more value
placed on women soldiers,'' Brig. Gen. Hedva Almog, commander of the
Womens' Corps, told reporters during a tour of a West Bank army base
that could not be named.
   The concept of moving women into combat training has evolved over
the past decade, largely out of a need to put more men on the front
lines of Israel's pressing conflicts in the occupied territories and
along the northern border with Lebanon.
   The process lately has been accelerated by the Palestinian
rebellion which has put new manpower demands on the army.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has estimated an average 10,000
soldiers were on duty in the occupied lands last year, several times
the pre-uprising level.
   ``Little by little there has been an increase in the number of
women being recruited into the army and a lack of manpower has led
the army to find solutions such as these,'' said Almog.
   Palestinian men and women harvested wheat only 100 yards from the
base fence where about a dozen women demonstrated battle skills.
   Three 19- and 20-year-old women maneuvered a tank into position
and pounded a hillside with artillery shells. Another showed some
privates how to hit the bull's-eye on a target 300 yards away, using
a telescope and a sharpshooting M-14 rifle.
   Cpl. Tami, the demolitions expert, practiced securing wires to a
detonator and exploding a one-pound charge made of plastic and a
substance like putty.
   ``It's a great experience,'' she said. ``It sounded like it would
be dangerous and interesting, so I wanted the adventure. My mother
would probably be quite shaken if she ever saw what I did.''
   She and other soldiers could not be fully identified in keeping
with army regulations.
   Initially, some of the women had trouble getting the men to take
orders from them, said Lt. Col. Yaffa, a commander of infantrywomen.
   But newer male recruits are more open, some saying they prefer
women commanders because they are less strict.
   ``They are more like mothers,'' said Pvt. Shlomo, 18, an
infantryman, after a session on an armored personnel carrier
commanded by a woman sergeant.
   Israeli feminists have welcomed the army's new attitude toward
women recruits but are critical of a law barring the women from
active combat duty. They contend it prevents true equality.
   Almog said women are kept out of combat for three reasons: to
encourage childbearing, to keep women from being killed or captured
and to avoid conflict with some Orthodox Jews who oppose women
adopting the role of men.
   ``It's a traditional view of women that you have to protect
them,'' said Galia Golan, a professor of political science at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``I think women should do real combat
duty. It is that one last bit of prestige that they need.''
   Tami, like most of her colleagues, said she was not bothered
about being kept off the battlefield.
   ``I don't really like war,'' she said, ``And I would have to
think a thousand times if I were involved, before I could hurt
somebody.''

<HEAD>Tourism Down in Greece Because of Image It Is Too Easy on Terrorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This land of ancient ruins and sun-splashed
islands is troubled by its reputation as a country too cozy with
terrorists.
   While Greece angrily denies it, the image persists with painful
consequences for tourism, its largest industry. Many American
tourists who once flocked to its shores now go elsewhere.
   ``It's strange that Greece has to suffer such accusations,'' said
Costas Skouras, the secretary-general of the Greek National Tourist
Organization.
   ``Let's face reality. We know that international terrorism is not
a new phenomenon and especially air terrorism. These incidents can
happen any time, any place.''
   However, the most common complaint is what critics call the loose
and easy style that Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist
government demonstrated in dealing with terrorists who come to
Greece after attacks elsewhere. The socialists lost their majority
in elections last month.
   In December, a Palestinian arrested in Greece was put on a plane
to Libya although he was wanted in Italy for a hand grenade attack
on Rome's main synagogue in October 1982. The attack killed a
2-year-old boy and wounded 37 other people.
   ``Other countries would give a Palestinian terrorist who killed a
baby the chair, the noose or life behind bars. Greece gave him a
plane ticket to freedom,'' the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith charged in an advertisement in The New York Times.
   Greece has repeatedly delayed ruling on a U.S. extradition
request for another Palestinian accused of planting a bomb on a Pan
Am jetliner.
   Last year, the United States accused Greece of allowing the Abu
Nidal terror group to open a logistics office in Athens in exchange
for a promise not to launch any attacks in Greece.
   Skouras contends such allegations are unfair and says Greece
often finds itself caught in the middle.
   ``Some Arab and Palestinian countries accuse the Israeli mission
of being a place where many terrorists, Israeli terrorists, are
hiding,'' he said. ``And they ask our government to give these
Israeli terrorists to the Arabs and close the mission.''
   Vassilis Fillias, a Greek sociologist and newspaper columnist,
said one problem is the the widespread pro-Palestinian feeling in
Greece makes it difficult for the government to take a strong stand
against Arabs or Palestinians.
   Although the Supreme Court approved it, Papandreou's justice
minister, Vassilis Rotis, blocked the extradition of Abdel Osama
al-Zomar, the Palestinian wanted for the Rome attack and whose
detention in Greece may have triggered the massacre of the City of
Poros cruise ship near Athens last July. Terrorists killed nine
people aboard the ship. No one has been arrested for the attack.
   Rotis explained his decision by saying al-Zomar ``was acting in
the struggle for the reacquisition of his country.''
   ``We consider it outrageous,'' Justin J. Finger, the associate
national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``If other nations followed Greece's
example it would ... increase terrorism rather than dampen its
activity,''
   Italy protested Greece's refusal to extradite al-Zomar and on May
23 an Italian court convicted him in absentia of organizing the
synagogue attack and sentenced him to life in prison.
   Skouras contends some allegations against Greece are distortions
aimed at intentionally hurting its tourist industry. He declined to
elaborate except to say, ``I cannot find any other explanation
except that this country has enemies somewhere, perhaps competitors
in the tourism field or in some other field.'' Official government
figures _ which tour operators dispute _ indicate overall tourism
has increased every year since 1983. Last year, the figures show,
8.2 million tourists came, leaving Greece with almost $2.5 billion
in foreign exchange.
   The tour operators say the figures are deceiving.
   ``All this terrorism has dramatically affected our business in
Greece,'' said Dimitris Mantzios, the general manager of a large
Greek travel agency with offices in the United States, Japan and
Canada.
   He said his American business has fallen by 50 percent in five
years. There are more Europeans and Japanese coming to Greece, but
he said they don't stay as long or spend as much.
   ``Americans spend maybe $2,000 while the Europeans $500 to
$1,000,'' he said.
   Andreas Potamianos, the president of Epirotiki Lines, said
Americans fell from 60 percent of the passengers on his line to just
3 percent by 1986.
   ``It mainly occurred in 1985 after the hijacking of the TWA
airplane. Then the United States issued a travel advisory asking
Americans not to come to Greece. That travel advisory had an immense
effect,'' he said.
   That hijacking June 14, 1985, of an Athens to Rome flight ended
in Beirut where a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 38 people were held
captive for 17 days.
   The travel advisory was lifted six weeks later after Greece
increased security at its airports.
   ``But it was lifted in a very silent way and imposed in a very
pompous way with high publicity,'' complained Potamianos. ``When it
was lifted, it was two lines on an inside page.''
   Government statistics indicate 295,000 Americans traveled to
Greece in 1988 as opposed to the 360,000 Greece expected and less
than half the number who came 10 years ago.

<HEAD>The Niceties of Investment Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When savers and investors turn to financial
professionals for advice, they usually look for two words _ ``buy''
or ``sell.''
   Experience shows, however, that they get far more than that. Even
if the words are printed in black and white, the vocabulary of
investment savants is rich in varying shades of gray.
   ``Hold'' is a familiar, and often perplexing, favorite. When
something isn't good enough to buy, what makes it worth hanging onto
just because you happen to own it?
   And if that gives you trouble, what to make of ``accumulate,''
``buy on weakness,'' ``switch,'' or ``use as a source of funds?''
   Faced with such choices, newcomers to the challenge of money
management often grow apprehensive, concerned that their ignorance
will be exposed when the natives see they don't speek the local
language.
   Cynics with longer experience, on the other hand, dismiss much of
what they hear in this vein as nothing more than mumbo-jumbo.
   The cynics have a point. Making investment recommendations is a
hazardous game and those who want to survive in the business for
long have a natural tendency to protect their flanks.
   Still, in fairness to these advisers, they are dealing with
questions that don't often yield clear yes-or-no answers for every
member of their audience. And many of the terms they use can be
translated into everyday English, with a little practice.
   Consider ``hold,'' for starters. A typical definition comes from
Donoghue's Moneyletter, an advisory service that uses a
buy-hold-sell system for rating mutual funds:
   ``If a `buy' fund dips in performance, it receives a `hold'
signal. If your fund becomes a `hold,' don't invest new money in
that fund, but don't sell it either. Although it's no longer a top
performer, it still compares favorably with other funds tracked in
Moneyletter.''
   For the long-term investor in particular, ``hold'' is often a
more sensible idea than either ``buy'' or ``sell.''
   Even if you should succeed in the nigh-impossible mission of
jumping from one hot investment to another at frequent intervals,
you have to consider the tax bills and transaction costs you might
ring up along the way.
   All that having been said, many veterans of the financial wars
still interpret a downgrading of a recommendation from buy to hold
as an adviser's gentle way of steering his or her clients away from
a given investment.
   Many other entries in the modern lexicon of investment
recommendations have evolved with the growing dominance of investing
institutions.
   Managers at these funds compete in a short-term performance derby
and are much less concerned with taxes or transaction costs than
individual investors must be. Because many of them are operating on
a large scale, they also cannot just ``buy'' or ``sell'' as readily
as the small investor can.
   Thus, ``accumulate'' translates as a sort of tepid buy
recommendation. In a meeting of an investment committee operating
under legal constraints of prudence, ``use as a source of funds'' is
a handy, if stuffy, way of saying ``sell this loser as judiciously
as you can and put the money someplace else.''
   No matter how you go about translating investment jargon, it is
always important to consider the source. If it comes from anybody
working on commission, you have every reason to expect to hear what
lawyers call ``dealers' talk.''
   Example in a recent midyear commentary from a research official
at a leading Wall Street firm: ``Stay well diversified in stocks,
bonds and cash, but do a little fine-tuning. Sell off big
stock-market winners, and recycle money back into undervalued
issues.''
   For a commission broker, there is money in selling and money in
buying. But there is no money in ``hold.''

<HEAD>Bush's China Course Fits Plan for Dealing with Communist World</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proceeding with caution despite Chinese
repression, President Bush is determined not to tear down bridges to
Beijing, believing that ties with the United States, though shaken,
may yet be the path to greater economic and political freedom.
   He's been facing political pressure for a more forceful U.S.
policy since the days before the crackdown and massacre in Tiananmen
Square, but he has resisted demands for tougher sanctions.
   That's based on practical judgment as well as philosophy. There's
little chance that the Chinese government would change its
repressive course because of them.
   Bush's China course fits his broader view of the way the United
States should deal with economic and political change in the
Communist world. He is doing so with care, wary of over-reaction
that could court trouble.
   Bush is applying that guideline as he journeys to Poland and
Hungary beginning on Sunday.
   ``It is important the United States show its interest in these
countries that are undergoing change,'' Bush said last week. ``You
don't want to overexhort. You don't want to overpromise. You don't
want to rally people to levels of political activity that might
cause repression.''
   In an interview with three Polish journalists, Bush repeatedly
stressed that concern. He said he would not seek to inflame, would
not do anything that could provoke crisis.
   When students seeking democratic reforms in China first occupied
Tiananmen Square, Bush resisted demands that he speak out forcefully
in behalf of their demonstrations as well as their goals. But he
said on May 22 that beyond urging the students to peacefully stand
up for their beliefs, he was not going to try to tell them what to
do. Bush also urged the Chinese government to seek a peaceful
resolution that would further democracy.
   The president said he did not want to exhort the students ``in a
way that is going to stir up a military confrontation.''
   When confrontation came, in the bloody crackdown of June 3, Bush
condemned it, cut off sales of military equipment, barred private
arms sales, barred military and other high-level visits, suspended
U.S. support of international bank loans to China, and left open the
possibility of further steps.
   He stopped short of trade sanctions or a break in diplomatic
relations.
   The Chinese government protested those measures as interference
in domestic affairs, but apparently continues to cooperate in U.S.
intelligence-gathering from missile and nuclear monitoring sites
near the Soviet border.
   While the administration has not been explicit about that, Bush
has said that any president must be concerned about the strategic
importance of U.S. relations with China.
   Bush said he will continue to express outrage about the attack
that ended the demonstrations, and the executions that have
followed. ``But I reiterate also my desire not to do damage to the
people themselves, because I believe that it was contact with the
United States and others in the West that moved the process of
economic reform forward and hopefully, some day will move the
process of political reform forward,'' he said.
   That has not satisfied Congress. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said the president should speak more forcefully
about Chinese executions, ``which can only be described as organized
murder _ terror by a government against its own people, seeking to
intimidate them.''
   The House voted unanimously on June 29 to toughen U.S. sanctions
against China. An amendment to a foreign aid bill would put into law
the steps Bush took, and add suspension of trade and development
programs, a ban on sale of police equipment, and a bar against
transfer of nuclear aterials that might have military application.
   The vote was 418-0, but it probably doesn't mean much. The bill
was sent to the Senate, which hasn't started work on the subject. So
it is far from enactment, although it did send a message.
   ``I think someone in this government ... has to speak clearly on
behalf of the American people and take more forceful action than the
president and the secretary of state have been to date willing to
take,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Rep.
William Broomfield, R-Mich., said ``the Chinese should be aware that
there is a deep-seated revulsion in Congress to what they have
done.''
   But Bush, who spent 16 months as U.S. representative to China in
1974 and 1975, noted after the crackdown that the Chinese
historically have been ``less than totally interested in what other
countries think of their performance.''
   Richard M. Nixon, who as president opened U.S. relations with
China, said a policy of reprisal would only isolate the Chinese
regime.
   ``Lashing back with punitive policies would be politically
popular and emotionally satisfying for the great majority of the
American people,'' he said. ``Such policies would make us feel
better.''
   But he said they wouldn't have any impact on the hard-liners who
hold power in China.

<HEAD>John Rhys-Davies Plays Gentle Blacksmith in Dickens Story</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Rhys-Davies, one of the most successful
of all cinematic chameleons, plays a rare English role in a new
miniseries based on Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations.''
   Rhys-Davies is Joe Gargery, the gentle giant of a blacksmith in
this Victorian tale of the creation and destruction of a snob. The
six-hour miniseries, which follows young Pip's sudden fortune and
his effort to become a gentleman, will be seen this Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday on the Disney Channel.
   The English-born actor is virtually a multinational cast all by
himself. He is perhaps best known as Sala, the Arabic friend of
archaeologist Indiana Jones in the movie series that began with
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and is currently on the screens with
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   The nationalities of other characters Rhys-Davies has played
include Indian (``Kim''), Portuguese (``Shogun''), Russian (``The
Living Daylights'') and Irish (``The Little Match Girl''). In NBC's
upcoming ``Desperado'' movie, he's English again.
   Rhys-Davies, like another English actor, Peter Ustinov, is quite
good with accents and has the sort of face that takes on the look of
whatever national accent is he using.
   ``Sala is an Arab and I give him an English accent with a touch
of his native Egypt,'' he said. ``Steven Spielberg (the director)
says he listens to Gilbert and Sullivan. He's more British than the
British.''
   Rhys-Davies said he sees Joe Gargery as ``a holy fool who is not
wholly foolish.''
   The miniseries also stars Anthony Hopkins as Magwitch, Jean
Simmons as Miss Havisham, and Anthony Calf as Pip. It was filmed on
location in England in the sites where Dickens set the story.
   ``It's a thankless task to play Pip because there are many times
when we don't like him,'' he said. ``He behaves badly. Of course, we
in the audience never show any snobbishness and we never make
judgments based on appearances. The growth of Pip is a painful
process in which he ends up sadder but wiser.
   ``Everybody in the piece has an ax to grind, with the possible
exception of Joe Gargery. He's the character that Dickens fell in
love with. Which gave him a problem because Dickens wrote it in
weekly installments as a serial. He began by making Gargery a figure
of fun and saddling him with a nagging wife.''
   As the story progressed, Dickens changed Gargery and eventually
killed off his wife and had him remarry Biddy.
   Rhys-Davies has a home in Los Angeles, but between work he
retreats to the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. He has a 16th-century
house named Ballateare where he can see Ireland and Scotland from
his bedroom window. The stone house is on the edge of a crumbling
cliff and he hopes to postpone its inevitable destruction by about
60 years.
   ``I bought it because I wanted to write a film about a man who
buys a house and tries to stop the sea from taking it,'' he said.
``It's a metaphor for coming to terms with time and growing older.
It should be rather sad and rather funny.''
   He said he finds the island home an idyllic place to rest and to
write. ``I started out wanting to be a playwright,'' he said. ``I've
written a few films.''
   He has two sons, Ben, who attends the University of California at
Berkeley, and Thomas, who is in school in England.
   Although he does a lot of television he has yet to do a series.
``If the writing was good I'd do it,'' he said. ``I'm not proud and
I like working. I'd just want time off each year to do a film of my
own. We're now in the early talk stage of doing a pilot.''
   Asked if there will be another Indiana Jones movie, he smiled.
   ``It's hard to turn down those numbers,'' he said. ``Harrison
Ford says he's getting too old for that sort of thing. They've very
demanding physically. But Harrison is rather fond of the character
and with the right story and the right director he might do one
more. Steven Spielberg has said he will not direct another one.''

<TEXT>
   Compared with a couple of decades ago, Americans
know a lot more about consumer rights and such marketplace
complications as warranties, variable interest rates, hidden charges
and poor labeling.
   But they might not be much better off. Markets change, especially
financial markets, and some of today's products and techniques are
beyond the comprehension of anyone who doesn't make a career of
keeping abreast.
   In effect, it creates in some marketplace areas the identical
problem that two decades of legislation and education have sought to
correct, i.e., an information and knowledge gap between professional
sellers and amateur buyers.
   The situation exists despite various studies supporting the view
that product quality, especially among manufactured items, is
probably higher today than it has been at any time since World War
II.
   That might or might not be true of investments, but what is
completely clear is that never before in history have investors been
challenged by more sophisticated products, aggressive marketing
techniques and high technology.
   A study by the American Association of Retired Persons observes
that many people today are first-time investors, neophytes whose
previous savings patterns were restricted to passbook savings
accounts or U.S. Savings Bonds.
   These days, however, they are in common stocks and mutual funds
and, if not already, may soon be in tax-free municipals, Treasury
bond options, commodities futures, time sharing, currencies, condos,
franchises and mineral rights.
   And more. As they grow older they might be faced with
understanding reverse home mortgages, pensions, annuities, estate
law and inheritance taxes, while trying to keep abreast of changes
and proposals regarding Social Security.
   The AARP's Public Policy Institute, which recently studied the
situation, estimates investment fraud now costs $1 billion a year.
It blames not just lax regulation or investor indifference, but
marketing techniques and technology.
   Magazines and newspapers, television, computer software and
specialized newsletters promote enticing opportunities and provide
more information than could ever be assimilated by the average
private investor, it says.
   The widespread use of 800 numbers and WATS lines has, it says,
``made it economically feasible to telephone large lists of
prospects and keep them on the phone at little expense until a sale
is consummated.''
   It adds that the widespread use of the credit card in telephone
sales has also had an impact on the investment market.
   It claims that with some 233.3 million Visa, Mastercard and
American Express accounts in force at the end of 1987, the major
credit card issuers have embarked on an aggressive marketing
strategy to produce even more.
   This strategy, it says, includes increased emphasis on telephone
sales with payment via credit card. Already, coins, land and
precious metals are marketed by phone, with the buyer's credit card
number used for billing.
   It comments: ``This type of sale has become so popular that
credit card companies report signed credit card slips as almost a
thing of the past.''
   The AARP says it is especially concerned because older people
seem to be targets of aggressive marketing.
   Many older Americans, it says, find themselves with large sums of
cash due to the sale of residences or because of cash payments on
life insurance policies. Widows may be forced to make financial
decisions for the first time in their lives. Many such people, it
says, have a tendency to seek advice and assistance when making
decisions, making them prey to aggressive sellers.
   It adds that not all the misrepresentation is by fringe
operators, claiming files of the Securities and Exchange Commission
show fraudulent investments are sometimes peddled by brokers working
for New York Stock Exchange firms.

   The National Baptist Convention U.S.A.
Inc. plans to launch a cable TV news magazine on black life and
achievements, says the denomination's president, the Rev. T.J.
Jemison.
   It will deal with `` education, politics, civics _ not just
religion _ all the problems of the world,'' said Jemison, who was in
Nashville for the denomination's annual meeting and dedication of
its new $10 million Baptist World Center.
   The 7.5 million-member denomination is the country's third
largest Protestant denomination, after the Southern Baptists and
United Methodists, and is the largest mainly black denomination.
   Jemison of Baton Rouge, La., said the cable program, ``The Black
World Today,'' would emphasize ``good news regarding the black
community'' instead of ``reports of drugs, crime and violence on the
nightly news.''
   The program is to be carried on the new Vision Interfaith
Satellite Network, an interdenominational cable network that reaches
7 million homes.

<DATELINE>NEWKIRK, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews chip away old paint and hack at
knee-high weeds at the abandoned Chilocco Indian School, seemingly
unaffected by the tempest brewing in this remote corner of Oklahoma.
   When a California group received state permission for a 75-bed
drug and alcohol treatment center, Newkirk thought the project on
the reservation six miles away would solve local economic troubles
brought on by oil and farming slumps.
   But the initial euphoria, like the old paint, has chipped away,
replaced by distrust, frustration, even fear.
   Townspeople say Narconon International hasn't been honest about
its affiliation with the Church of Scientology, its financing, its
medical credentials and its plans for the project, which will draw
mostly out-of-state clients.
   They say Narconon denied the project had anything to do with
Scientology until Newkirk officials turned up a Scientology magazine
with a story headlined ``Trained Scientologists to Staff Huge
Oklahoma Facility.''
   And the mayor says Narconon tried to dupe locals at a staged
ceremony, where a $200,000 check and a glowing study were presented
to Narconon by a group that turned out to be part of Narconon itself.
   Now the town fears it could earn a ``cult image'' because of the
project's ties to Scientology, which follows the teachings of the
late science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Former members have
accused Scientology of fraud and mental abuse, and the Internal
Revenue Service has challenged its tax-exempt status as a religion.
   ``People interested in coming to this town will see the Church of
Scientology thing _ the cult thing _ and I think that that image
will hurt our possibilities for growth and development,'' Mayor
Garry Bilger said in an interview last month.
   Some townspeople say they worry about the kind of people the
project will attract and that the stately 80-building campus, built
of native Oklahoma stone and tucked more than a mile off the nearest
road, will become a Scientology recruiting station.
   ``I don't think any of us are against drug abusers getting
rehabilitation,'' said Mike Clifton, pastor of the First Christian
Church. ``(But) there's a lot of concern in the community because we
really don't know what these folks are exactly about. What really
worries us is what they're not saying.''
   In the basement of the First Baptist Church, pastor Mark Jones is
making copies of a videotape of a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary on Scientology, which he showed to his congregation at a
worship service.
   The tapes, along with Scientology literature, have been
circulating in this town of 2,400. There have been town meetings and
public forums, including a sometimes heated session with state
officials who approved the Narconon project before the town knew it
was supported by Scientology.
   ``The town got the shaft,'' said insurance agent Charles
Eisenhauer. ``I don't think anybody can undo anything that's been
done so far.'' The center is scheduled to open in September.
   Narconon officials say Newkirk's concern is inflated and
unwarranted. Narconon is a legitimate, worldwide drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program with 23 years' experience and an 86 percent
success rate, they assert.
   Narconon spokesman Gary Smith said he tried to reassure the town
that Narconon's ``sole intention is to get people off drugs.'' He
said the town has been misled.
   ``There's fear being put into the town by false information being
fed in there by somebody who's in favor of drug abuse. They're
either connected to selling drugs or they're using drugs,'' Smith
said.
   Smith declined to be more specific about the identity or
whereabouts of these ``outside sources with criminal motives.''
   ``Trust me, I know,'' he said.
   Another Narconon attempt at persuasion provoked an angry response.
   In a letter printed May 18 on the front page of the weekly
Newkirk Herald Journal, Narconon president John Duff wrote: ``There
will be those that will not want Narconon to succeed at Chilocco
because they are for drugs and are on the other side in the battle
against drugs.''
   Jones, the Baptist minister, responded the following week,
writing he ``resented the implication, or more accurately the
accusation, that was made by Narconon's Mr. Duff. He accused me of
supporting illegal drug use in our area if I did not swallow his
program hook, line and sinker.''
   Bilger said he had been so optimistic about the promise of a
revitalized Chilocco that last December he wrote Oklahoma health
officials supporting Narconon.
   But the mayor said his winter hope turned to disillusionment by
spring when he learned of Narconon's history, and he came to believe
he had been misled when Narconon held an emotional ceremony April 8
in which the Association for Better Living and Education presented a
glowing study of Narconon and the $200,000 check.
   Later Bilger learned that ABLE shared a street address in Los
Angeles with Narconon, and is identified in a Scientology magazine
as part of Narconon.
   ``They totally misrepresented what was going on,'' Bilger said.
   ``I came away with the impression that we had an independent
group here interested in mankind and they had researched the
Narconon process. Then I find out ABLE and Narconon are part of the
same organization,'' he said.
   ``I try to be straightforward, and when somebody doesn't do that,
I wonder why.''
   In late June, Narconon's Smith used a copy of Bilger's December
letter of support to suggest to The Associated Press that the mayor
supported Narconon.
   Bilger says the December letter no longer reflects his feelings.
   ``I imagine if I was in his shoes I'd use it, too,'' Bilger said.
``I just think now it (Narconon) is a problem and if all the facts
were out at the time, things might have been done differently.''
   The Chilocco Indian School closed in 1980 and was declared
surplus property by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which turned
control over to five Indian tribes _ Ponca, Kaw, Pawnee,
Otoe-Missouria and Tonkawa.
   Last year, Narconon invited representatives of tribes throughout
the country to a meeting in Clearwater, Fla. Narconon touted its
program and said it was looking for a site for a treatment center.
Currently, Narconon's only U.S. inpatient center is a Los Angeles
clinic with 12 beds.
   A Ponca representative told Narconon about the Chilocco site. The
25-year lease eventually drawn up offers the tribes a percentage of
gross earnings, up to $16 million. The tribal leadership remains
enthusiastic about the Narconon project.
   In January, the Oklahoma Health Planning Commission gave Narconon
approval for an initial 75 beds. The group seeks 150 beds, with
growth projected to 400.
   Robert Lobsinger, publisher of the weekly Herald Journal, was by
then becoming curious about Narconon. In Newkirk's tiny library he
found articles about ties to Scientology and past run-ins with
officials. His first story, published April 27 under the headline
``Chilocco Drug Treatment Center May Be Part of Notorious Religious
Cult,'' set the town abuzz.
   Townspeople said they have repeatedly asked Narconon what medical
credentials they have, and so far, have received no answer.
   ``My first question is, do they think that everyone down here is
stupid?'' said Jones. ``People around here are not world travelers,
but they've got a lot of common sense and they ask a lot of
questions.
   ``We've encountered deceit from the beginning,'' he said. ``There
have been smoke screens everywhere, and there have been flat-out
lies.''

<HEAD>Auction `Fever' Boosts Fine Art Prices</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   Fine art prices are going, going, gonzo this
auction season, soaring through the ceiling when the gavel comes
down. But even as the art market booms, some experts fear the
picture may not stay so pretty.
   ``A lot of people are being taken in by this sort of fever,''
said George Goldner, a curator and top buyer at the J. Paul Getty
Museum, the nation's richest. ``The longer it goes on, the more it
resembles a bubble that one day will burst.''
   For now, the inflation is inescapable, as even Goldner will
attest: He paid $32.5 million for a 16th century painting last
month, more than tripling the record for an Old Master at auction.
And all that glitters is not Goldner's:
   _Records were set for more than three dozen modern, post-modern
and impressionist painters at sales in May, including $47.9 million
for a Picasso self-portrait _ an 800 percent increase from its 1981
price. Only one painting has done better, a Van Gogh that drew $53.9
million in 1987.
   _An 18 century American bookcase desk sold in May for $12.1
million, quadrupling the record for a piece of furniture. The
reported buyer was neither museum nor gallery, but a Texas
financier, Robert M. Bass.
   _A Catskill Mountains landscape sold for $8.25 million, tops for
an old American painting. A Frederic Remington bronze brought $4.4
million, a new height for American sculpture. ``The Birds of
America'' etchings by John James Audubon sold for $3.96 million, an
increase of $2 million in less than two years.
   Such prices are reflected in thousands of lesser sales, rippling
through the art world in a delicious shudder, at least for sellers.
Sotheby's auction house, the world's biggest, gaveled off $1.8
billion in goods last year, up by $400 million from 1987. And this
year is far bigger.
   ``It's awesome. It's mind-boggling,'' said Milton Esterow,
publisher of ARTNews magazine. ``Art has become an international
currency. The market has exploded. It's a revolution, a renaissance,
like we've never seen before.''
   But the glee is not universal. Art experts say the soaring sums
are pricing many museums out of the market, leaving them unable to
expand or upgrade their collections. Some say auction hype has
falsely inflated some prices.
   ```It's simple and easy: Buy something and you'll get rich.' This
is the message of the auction rooms,'' said Goldner. ``It's the
wrong message and people eventually are going to get hurt by it.
There will be a day when the market will shake out, and bad modern
paintings won't be worth what people are paying for them today.''
   The reason for art's price explosion is simple: Because of
worldwide economic good times, many people have much more money. As
some of that cash migrated to art, prices rose _ drawing finer art
to the market and raising prices even higher. And 1986 federal tax
changes limited the benefits of donating art to museums, putting
even more works on the market.
   Additionally, said Harvey Katz, an art market analyst for the
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., the auction houses have
improved their marketing techniques. Catalogs are less intimidating,
major works are sent on tour before sales, bidding is simpler and
telephone bids are accepted.
   ``As the auction houses have become more accessible, they've
captured more and more business,'' said Katz. One result: Christie's
auction house is rumored as a takeover target. And Sotheby's is
splitting its stock, two for one.
   But Goldner said auction house promotions can misrepresent the
value of some pieces, particularly costly modern art. And he called
Sotheby's practice of lending money to buyers a dangerous trend that
inflates the market and increases the perception of art as a
speculative commodity.
   John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, maintained that
buyers still are primarily collectors drawn to certain works, not
investors seeking profit. And he said marketing, ultimately, does
not create sales.
   ``What weapons do we use to get people into bidding? They do
spend real money,'' Marion said. Sotheby's willingness to loan
buyers some of that money, he added, is no different from a bank's
loan to a home buyer.
   Another concern is the art boom's effect on public museums, many
of which are finding themselves unable to afford major purchases or
pressed to sell some works to private buyers, which removes the art
from public view.
   Such was the case for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, a
modern art gallery that sold the $8.25 million Catskill landscape,
by Frederic Edwin Church, to finance purchases of modern works. The
painting was on loan to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, which had
it on display. A dealer bought it.
   ``This was an issue we wrestled with long and hard,'' said Erwin
Kelen,a board member of the Walker and its acquisitions committee
chairman. ``Is it our responsibility to keep a 19th century painting
on public view, even if not in our institution? Or to maximize
acquisitions for our own collection?''
   While the latter concern prevailed, Kelen said, the painting
likely will outlive its new owners and be returned to a museum.
Goldner, however, said he feared the growing concept of art as a
commodity would work against that outcome.
   ``The sad fact is that a lot of people who call themseves
collectors today are investors,'' he said. ``And instead of giving
their collections toward the end of their life to a museum to put on
display, they see their apotheosis as being a successful sale at
Sotheby's.''
   Marion, for his part, is looking forward to Sotheby's greatest
sale yet: An estate auction next fall that includes 44 paintings
valued at $1 million or more each, including a Van Gogh, a Picasso
and nine Monets. The total take should easily exceed $100 million.
   ``The fall,'' he said, ``looks to be very, very strong.''

   During his protracted battle to corner a
quarter of the nation's poultry market, chicken king Don Tyson drew
inspiration from a word he scribbled on the mirror in his private
bathroom.
   ``Patience,'' Tyson impulsively wrote in black felt-tip Oct. 5,
as he battled with ConAgra Inc. to absorb rival poultry giant Holly
Farms.
   The chairman of Tyson Foods wanted a reminder during the long and
agonizing takeover war to slow down and analyze developments that
stood to double the worth of his $2 billion company.
   ``Every time I stepped in the bathroom, I faced this word,'' the
59-year-old Tyson said as he pointed to the looping cursive on the
mirror.
   ``Patience. That was the key. We were just looking for time.''
   Patience _ and a sweetened bid _ paid off June 23 when Tyson
Foods and Holly Farms agreed to a merger deal worth $1.4 billion. On
July 18, Springdale-based Tyson's is to pay $70 per share for stock
in Holly Farms.
   ``If it hadn't been such a perfect fit, we would have gone off.
But it was just such a perfect fit with our company, productwise and
geographically,'' Tyson said of Holly Farms, which is headquartered
at Memphis, Tenn.
   The combination has prospects for huge profits, Tyson said, since
the company that bears his name emphasizes wholesale and
institutional service, with some supermarket sales, and Holly Farms
is a force in grocery stores, taking 40 percent of the fresh-poultry
market in New York City and Washington, D.C.
   The combination also promises to provide Tyson with the chickens
he needs to keep his company growing at the pace that has raised
annual revenues from $660 million to $1.9 billion in five years.
   The deal will give Tyson 25 percent of the fresh-poultry market
in the United States.
   When he first considered uniting with Holly Farms more than two
decades ago, the numbers were not so impressive. Tyson had one
poultry operation in the Ozarks, and Fred Lovette's Holly Farms was
about the same size.
   ``He was the first one to pre-package poultry and deliver it to
the supermarket, which was a major change,'' Tyson said of Lovette.
``And he was nice enough to show that to me 24 years ago, and we
talked then about maybe our companies should get together.''
   But the friendly discussion went nowhere, nor did conversations
Tyson initiated about six years ago with R. Lee Taylor II, Holly
Farms' president and chief executive officer.
   Last summer, Tyson asked the Stephens Inc. investment banking
firm at Little Rock to analyze how the companies might fit.
   ``Then I started visiting with Lee again. When it was obvious we
weren't going to get together, friendly, we had to tell Lee, `Hey,
we're going to go to your stockholders and ask them if they'd like
for us to get together.' That started this whole process,'' Tyson
said.
   The eight-month fight with ConAgra to gain control of Holly Farms
ranks as one of the nation's longest-running takeover wars.
   After the final agreement was reached, a janitor at the Tyson
Foods corporate complex was allowed to wipe clean her boss's
bathroom mirror.
   Last week, Tyson filled his red mug with coffee and settled into
a chair at his huge conference table to reflect on the takeover.
   ``I'm up to my neck in debt,'' he said, then laughed and added
that he has been there before.
   ``All of us are waking up with a better feeling every morning,''
said Tyson. ``Every time we look at this company, it's better than
we thought it was when we bought it.''
   Didn't he get upset when his offers were repeatedly spurned by
the Holly Farms executives and board?
   ``Just privately,'' Tyson said, ``because we were trying to
figure out a strategy. And we had a strategy, and then it didn't
work, and when the strategy didn't work, I was mad at myself.
   ``But then I remembered what my dad told me _ it costs money to
get mad.''
   It also cost money to settle with Holly Farms' other suitor,
whose advances threw a wrench into Tyson's strategy. ConAgra, of
Omaha, Neb., is to get $50 million for its trouble.
   Taylor, who will get $15.6 million for his Holly Farms shares,
will not stay on. ``He said something about taking a round-the-world
cruise, 'cause he's got enough money to,'' Tyson said.
   Tyson also took it easy after the agreement, flying to Alaska for
five days of salmon fishing. He said the fishing camp was 45 miles
from a road, and nowhere near a telephone.
   July's schedule is filled with meetings to push the merger along,
and accepting bids on two divisions of Holly Farms _ rendering and
flour _ that Tyson plans to sell to raise cash.
   Tyson, who joined his father in the business in 1952 and took
over the reins in 1967, also will keep looking for acquisitions,
which he compares to his beloved fishing excursions, saying,
``You've always got your hook in the water.''
   ``Of course, we've got our work cut out for us here for a couple
of years. Our boat's loaded. We're going to divest and we have a
goal by Sept. 30 of this year that we will pay back $500 million of
this debt. We'll do that,'' he said.
   ``They asked me how many chickens I wanted. I said, `Well,
General Motors at one time had 51 percent of the car business,' and
I thought that was fair.
   ``I'm patient.''

<TEXT>
   Chris Isaak's dark and dreamlike music has
long been a hit with audiences in the San Francisco area, but
national fame and a spot on the pop charts have eluded him.
   A hit single would be swell, says the 32-year-old singer and
songwriter, but it's not the most important thing.
   ``I like to sing. If I had a hit, that'd be great,'' Isaak says.
``I'd be really overjoyed to have a hit _ tickled pink. But I'm not
worried about that. I'm more worried about just keeping my job.''
   Maybe he's not a household word, but Isaak has a solid reputation
as someone who borrows the best from country-western and rock 'n'
roll to produce an original sound.
   His newly released album, ``Heart Shaped World,'' is more upbeat
than earlier efforts and possibly his best. Guitarist James Wilsey
adds a polished, heavily tremoloed background to Isaak's
velvety-soft vocals.
   Wilsey is largely responsible for the sound that has grabbed the
attention of critics. He has a sharp ear for what works with Isaak's
lyrics, but he says a sophisticated computer system is partly
responsible for the sound he achieves on stage.
   This is the band's third album since 1985, and the third time
observers have said Isaak is teetering on the edge of national
acclaim.
   But the man often compared to Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, two
of his many idols, has a hard time being serious when describing the
new album.
   ``This is pretty much me singing a bunch of songs I wrote _ just
like the first two albums,'' he said. ``If you liked the first two
albums, this is pretty much the same route. If you didn't like the
first two albums, this is all different.''
   If Isaak in person was like the Isaak in his music, one would
probably meet a somewhat somber person dressed in black. His songs
often speak of lost, or nearly lost, love. One imagines the
songwriter sitting in an unlighted room peering out a window at a
grimy, pre-dawn city street.
   But the in-person Isaak is a regular cut-up. The Stockton,
Calif., native talks with a slightly goofy rural California accent _
which disappears when he sings _ and gets a kick out of telling
stories, like the one about how he learned to play guitar by
sneaking into his older brother's room.
   Nick Isaak had told his younger brother to stay away from his
prized instrument.
   ``Every day, it was forbidden. But he'd go to school and I'd play
his guitar. I'd put it back exactly where it belonged,'' the singer
said. ``One day, I was sitting there watching TV _ I had put the
guitar back _ and the string just popped. They'll do that sometimes.
I heard it go BRRROOOIING. I thought, `I'd been playing it. But I
wasn't playing it right now.'
   ``He worked me over pretty good for that one.''
   Then there's the one about how he acquired his first guitar, the
Silvertone he's played on all three albums and the inspiration for
his first band's name. He'd been eyeballing it every day as he
walked by a local pawnshop. Finally, he asked his brother for help.
   ``My brother was better at arguing on prices, so I said, `Why
don't you go see if you can get a deal.' So he called the fire
department and told them the pawn shop was a fire hazard, so they
had to get rid of a bunch of stuff.''
   He bought the guitar for $80.
   ``We didn't like the people at that pawn shop, anyway. They'd
sold my mother a single guitar string for $4,'' Isaak said.
   Fans are familiar with Isaak's brand of humor. He often
introduces songs with long whimsical tales involving members of the
band. He drives a 1964 Nova. At a recent record release party at the
Fairmont Hotel, he showed up in a floral-patterned suit made from
window drapes.
   And for some undisclosed reason, Isaak thinks Tikis are neat. He
keeps dozens of the Polynesian idols, big and small, on his dining
room table and in his kitchen. He even owns a painting of a Tiki, an
awful thing that looks like it might have been drawn under the
influence of mescaline.
   But the zaniness doesn't carry over into the music.
   Isaak has always thought of his style as country-western.
However, numerous influences are apparent, including rockabilly and
rhythm and blues.
   ``I try not to make things that are too angry-sounding,'' he
said. ``It makes me nervous when I hear music that is just people
banging away. If I listen to it, it's got to be pretty, like Bing
Crosby.''
   ``I don't like people who can't sing but say, `I'll make records
despite that fact.'''
   Critics often speak of the dark side of Isaak's music. One deejay
in Washington dubbed him the ``Baron of Brood,'' and singles such as
``You Owe Me Some Kind of Love,'' off his second LP, and ``Wicked
Game'' off the new album exemplify that lonelier side.
   As a young man living in Stockton, a place he describes as
``Fresno without all the glitter,'' Isaak attended the University of
Pacific and took up boxing. But like early ideas of being a
filmmaker, the boxing career petered out. He went to Japan as a
transfer student, and spent much of his time singing and playing the
guitar.
   Isaak came to San Francisco in 1980 and later hooked up with Erik
Jacobsen, who produced his albums and eventually became his manager.
Until he met Wilsey, Isaak was the lead guitarist in his band.
   ``Jimmy and I met in 1982. I had a three-piece band and he said,
`Hey let me in, I can play guitar better than that.''
   Wilsey, who started out running the sound system for Isaak's
first band, said he was immediately taken with the budding singer.
   ``I realized he was the funniest person I'd ever met. It was nice
to hang around him and laugh when other things seemed depressing,''
Wilsey said.
   Aside from the music, Isaak has enjoyed a successful sideline
career as a film actor. He's appeared in two episodes of the TV show
``Private Eye'' and had a cameo in Jonathan Demme's ``Married to the
Mob.''

<HEAD>Coffee Prices Collapse to 8-Year Low as Safety Net Removed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee bean prices tumbled to their lowest levels
in eight years in London trading on heavy selling triggered by the
International Coffee Organization's announcement that it would
suspend export quotas.
   ``The news is negative and the immediate reaction very
predictable,'' said analyst Laurence Eagles of commodities traders
Gerrard and National Intercommodities.
   Coffee beans for September delivery closed at $1,387 a metric ton
Tuesday in London, down $98 from Monday's final price. Earlier in
the day, the price fell to $1,343.
   Selling was particularly heavy in London on Tuesday because the
New York market was closed for the Fourth of July holiday.
   The 74-nation organization of coffee consumer- and
producer-nations announced the suspension of quotas late Monday,
after members rejected proposals to extend the existing
international coffee pact. The suspensions took effect at midnight.
   The price of coffee, which reached this year's peak of $1,896 a
ton in January, had been falling steadily ahead of Monday's
emergency meeting.
   Export quotas have been in force since the early 1960s, apart
from a 19-month break in 1986-87 and a six-year gap in the 1970s.
They are used to keep surplus coffee off the market in an effort to
balance supply with demand and so maintain the average world price
above a target minimum of $1.20 a pound.
   With the quotas gone, traders predicted a free-for-all among
exporting countries seeking to raise their market shares.
   Many delegates blamed the organization's failure to reach a new
deal on the hard line of the United States, the main consuming
nation, and the tough position of the 11-nation Group of Mild
Arabica Producers, largely comprised of Central American producers,
not to extend quotas.
   Singapore was the only other consuming nation besides the United
States to vote against the extension.
   The Mild Arabica Producers, led by Mexico and Costa Rica, pressed
for guarantees of a bigger slice of the market before they would
agree to support an extension of the quotas.
   Their proposals were backed by the United States, but roundly
defeated when put to a vote.
   Colombia _ the world's second-biggest producer, for which coffee
represents 40 percent of its export income _ led the fight to keep
the coffee agreement and its quota system alive.
   Colombia has been much more active than Brazil, the biggest
producer. Coffee now generates less than 10 percent of Brazilian
foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
   First City Bancorporation of Texas is negotiating
for the sale of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s investment
interest in the Houston-based bank holding company, says Chairman A.
Robert Abboud.
   First City and the FDIC are seeking to redeem the FDIC's interest
or sell it to a third party.
   The FDIC participated in the $1.6 billion reorganization of the
old First City entity in April 1988 by providing $970 million. A
group of investors led by Abboud then purchased First City and the
FDIC bought about 2 million shares of the new company's preferred
stock and a warrant to buy 1 million additional shares until 1993.
   That situation has created confusion about the FDIC's
relationship with First City, Abboud said Tuesday.
   ``The FDIC sought upside profit potential through direct
investment wholly apart from the assistance package,'' he said.
   Abboud said the sale of the FDIC's investment in First City would
give the company greater expansion flexibility.
   He said the FDIC would realize a return on its investment of
about 50 percent if the sale were made now.
   ``The sale of the FDIC's investment will eliminate all such
confusion and misperceptions and serve the best interests of all
concerned _ First City, its shareholders, its customers and the
FDIC.''
   First City operates 20 banks in 62 Texas locations and several
others out of state.

<HEAD>Computer Images of Plants Could Help Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Illinois researchers say
farmers' plants ought to be in pictures, and they want to take some
of the uncertainty out of farmers' decisions with the help of
computer vision technology.
   ``Farmers are constantly dealing with problems they can't control
_ they plant, pray and wait to harvest,'' researcher Ken Tarbell, a
University of Illinois graduate student, said recently. ``If we can
take technology and make their lives less stressful, that's what
we're here for.''
   Tarbell and UI agricultural engineer John Reid say
picture-perfect plants, photographed and displayed on a computer
screen, may give scientists a better idea of how healthy crops grow.
   He said once the system is perfected, farmers could take
photographs of their corn or soybeans at regular intervals, feed the
images into a computer, and find out quickly if their crops were
healthy or sick.
   ``Between planting and harvest, farmers rely on experience and
field history to make management decisions,'' said Tarbell. ``Our
goal is to give them timely information about their crops.''
   Tarbell selects three plants from his test field every day, puts
them in pots and photographs them in a studio next to a scale that
helps a computer analyze size and color. The color slides are
transferred to a high-resolution computer screen.
   One thing the computer studies is the leaf area, making its
calculations much more quickly and accurately than the traditional
method of hand measuring each leaf. Healthy plants have broader
leaves that capture more energy from the sun and help the crop yield
more at harvest.
   ``Scientists now get about 20 to 30 different measurements to
describe the condition of a plant in the field,'' said Tarbell. ``A
picture is worth a thousand words and they're only using a small
fraction of them.''
   ``The computer can spot trouble early,'' said Tarbell. ``It's a
lot more sensitive. A computer can see 256 shades of green and
people are lucky to be able to see 10.''
   For example, a lack of nitrogen fertilizer or an attack by
rootworms would put corn under stress and leaves would begin to
change from a healthy green to yellow. The computer could spot the
clue immediately, while there still was time to correct the problem.
   Farmers also might use the computer system to predict more
accurately how much grain they will have to market after harvest.
   Tarbell said the secret to good yields is keeping plants in ``an
optimum growth pattern.''
   ``We want to be able to tell farmers how to keep them there, or
if it's cost effective,'' said Tarbell.
   The computer system also could help scientists who are doing
things like developing new hybrids with drought resistance, he said.
The new variety of plant would be grown next to the existing hybrid,
and water would be limited.
   ``If the old hybrid starts to brown, they could measure the
damage exactly and the drought resistance of the new hybrid,'' said
Tarbell. ``You could do that without a computer but this machine
loves numbers and eliminates margin for error.''

<HEAD>Gold Fields Board Recommends Acceptance of New Hanson Bid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with board recommending Hanson's offer.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC has
unanimously recommended that shareholders accept a new offer worth
$5.53 billion for the mining giant from British conglomerate Hanson
Trust PLC.
   The new 3.5 billion pound bid, which consists of cash, stock
warrants and an extra dividend payment, was announced Tuesday night
by Lord Hanson, the chairman of Hanson Trust.
   It was immediately supported by Consolidated Gold Fields'
chairman and chief executive, Rudolf Agnew, and later Tuesday night
gained the backing of the board.
   On June 22, Hanson in a move that took the stock market by
surprise offered 3.1 billion pounds, then worth $4.8 billion, for
Consolidated Gold Fields.
   But on that occasion, Agnew advised Consolidated Gold Fields'
shareholders not to accept, saying the offer undervalued the assets
of the company.
   Consolidated Gold Fields is primarily involved in mining South
African gold and platinum. It also has interests in U.S.
construction materials and owns a 49.3 percent stake in Newmont
Mining Corp., the largest U.S. gold miner.
   Hanson Trust is Britain's fourth largest company with interests
ranging from bricks and Ever Ready batteries to tobacco and light
industry. Among its American brands are Smith Corona typewriters,
Durkee spices and Farberware cookware.
   Last April, a U.S. court blocked a merger bid for Consolidated
Gold Fields from South African-controlled Minorco SA, an investment
group.
   Minorco's bid was worth 3.65 billion pounds, equivalent at the
time to $6.2 billion.
   A majority of Consolidated Gold Fields' shareholders indicated
that they wanted to accept Minorco's bid. But the U.S. court refused
to lift an injunction against a Minorco takeover arising from an
antitrust suit.
   U.S. courts had ruled that Minorco had ambitions to create a
world gold monopoly.
   One of the first shareholders to back the Hanson bid was Minorco
itself, which has pledged its 29.9 percent holding in Consolidated
Gold Fields to Hanson.
   Minorco had threatened to sack all of Consolidated Gold Fields'
management above the level of operations manager if its bid
succeeded.
   But Hanson said Tuesday night that he looked forward to welcoming
Agnew as a non-executive director of Hanson Trust if the Hanson
Trust bid is accepted.

   Elders IXL Ltd chairman John Elliott
and other executives said Wednesday they were close to completing a
buyout bid for the brewing company through their privately held
firm, Harlin Holdings Pty Ltd.
   Elliott said at a shareholders meeting that Harlin is close to
arranging financing for a Part C stock exchange offer to all
shareholders at 3 Australian dollars, or about $2.30, which values
the company at 5.31 billion australian dollars, or $4.08 billion.
   Elliott said Harlin would only make an offer if it could arrange
financing and received consent from the National Companies and
Securities Commission.
   He said Harlin expected to make an announcement before an
extraordinary general meeting of Elders shareholders to be held on
July 27.
   Harlin, which is controlled by Elliott and other senior
executives, currently has 18.5 percent of Elders' ordinary shares,
which amounts to about 34 percent on a fully diluted basis.
   Elders, which has interests in brewing, agriculture, finance and
resources, is one of Australia's biggest companies. It owns the
Courage breweries in Britain, Carling O'Keefe breweries in Canada,
financial-services companies in Asia, grain-trading businesses in
the United States and natural resources interests in New Zealand.
   Elders says it is the seventh-largest brewer in the world. Its
main brand is Fosters Lager.

<HEAD>Nationwide Consumer Group Launches Boycott of U.S. Grapefruit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean consumer groups launched a
nationwide boycott Wednesday against imported U.S. grapefruit,
claiming it is chemically tainted and unsafe to eat.
   The U.S. Embassy and a spokesman for Florida growers who export
the fruit said the boycott is another salvo in a grapefruit war that
started over a huge misunderstanding.
   The Citizens Alliance for Consumer Protection of Korea said 10
leading consumer groups in Seoul and 60 others around the country
are not satisfied that U.S. grapefruit is safe and are launching a
nationwide campaign to warn people not to eat it.
   Grapefruit sales have plunged. Ads placed by grapefruit importers
appeared in Korean newspapers Tuesday headlined: ``Grapefruit has no
cancer-causing substance. We are sorry consumers have been worried.''
   At issue is the interpretation of a Korean laboratory report that
consumer advocates claimed shows Florida grapefruit contains
daminozide (Alar), a suspected cancer-causing agent.
   The U.S. Embassy and a citrus expert from Florida issued
statements and then held a news conference June 26 to say that the
scientific nature of the test was misinterpreted by laymen.
   ``Alar is not used on, and has never been used on grapefruit,''
said Dan L. Gunter, executive director of the Florida Department of
Citrus in Lakeland. ``We're concerned and hopeful the matter will be
clarified promptly.''
   The test, performed by the government's Agricultural Chemical
Research Institute, estimated Alar at 0.5 parts per million on the
peel and flesh of grapefruit. Gunter said that since the lab test
could not measure below 0.5 PPM, the report was ``equivalent to a
finding of no Alar.''
   A few days later the lab clarified the report and agreed that
could be the case. But then consumers demanded an explanation of
other chemicals used in the production of grapefruit.
   The Korean Women's Association asked for a second test, but the
lab refused and the National Health Institute said it did not have
the equipment.
   Korean farmers use pesticides and chemicals, and consumers are
increasingly concerned about their effect on food products. Some
growers also use Alar.
   ``As a Korean consumer, all we want is safe fruit,'' said Song
Bo-kyung of the Citizens Alliance. ``We are not convinced American
grapefruit is safe.''
   ``If the grapefruit businessmen accepted our concerns and made
efforts to improve, we would wait. But when they don't listen,
consumers have only one choice, a boycott,'' she said.
   Consumer organizations said the boycott is targeting 43 local
trading firms that are major importers and sellers of grapefruit.
Grapefruit has disappeared from some major markets but is available
in food stalls and back street stores.
   Grapefruit imports to South Korea have tripled every year for the
last four years and now total $10 million annually. Grapefruit is
imported from California, Texas and Arizona, but about
three-quarters comes from Florida.
   Florida, which produces one-half of the world's grapefruit, has
exported 300,000 boxes each weighing 85 pounds so far this year.
About 14 million boxes, a quarter of the state's production, is
exported annually to world markets, Gunter said.
   A spokesman for the grapefruit industry said the fruit can be
stored in cool containers for a few weeks, but unused fruit
eventually would spoil and have to be destroyed. He had no figures
for lost sales. South Korea does not produce grapefruit.

   Recession worries kept the stock market on the
defensive today as traders returned from the July 4 holiday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.43 to 2,442.34
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 283 up, 663 down and
401 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.74 million shares as of 10

   Analysts said recent economic reports showing a further slowdown
in business activity over the last couple of months had put

<HEAD>Crop Futures Soar on Dry Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices surged in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with some corn and
soybean markets up their permitted daily limits on forecasts for dry
Midwestern weather.
   The buying stemmed from a National Weather Service six-to-10-day
forecast, issued after the close of trading Monday, predicting
below-normal rainfall in the Corn Belt right through the middle of
next week.
   The soybean market also was buoyed by ideas that the extremely
wet conditions in the Southeast will prevent planting of soybean
crops there. But analysts said the dry forecast was the overriding
influence in early trading.
   ``The only way you can get the markets limit-up in July is almost
always weather,'' said Cathy Leow, a vice-president and grain-market
analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Drier-than-normal conditions also are forecast for most U.S.
wheat areas, which would help get the winter wheat harvest back on
track in the Great Plains but could threaten the vulnerable spring
wheat crop in the North.
   In early trading, wheat was 4{ cents lower to 10} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $4.03 a bushel; corn was 5
cents to the limit 10 cents higher with July at $2.82 a bushel; oats
were 10 cents to 12 cents higher with July at $1.69 a bushel;
soybeans were 21{ cents to the limit 30 cents higher with July at
$7.62 a bushel.
   Hog and pork-belly futures were trading at or near their lower
limits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a continuing reaction
to Friday's quarterly Agriculture Department hogs-and-pigs
inventory, which showed fewer animals than traders had expected.
Cattle futures also were lower in early trading.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .30 cents lower with August at
69.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .67 cent lower
with August at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were 1.40 cent lower to .13
cent higher with July at 47.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were locked down the 2-cents-a-pound limit across the board with
July at 31.85 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Monday with
all pork futures down their daily limits.

<HEAD>Investigation Targets Recent Model of Workhorse Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jet engine that remains the workhorse of the
Boeing 737 fleet is under close inspection because of problems that
led to the temporary grounding of 34 Boeing jets last month.
   Taken out of service after fan blades broke apart in flight on
two planes within three days, the jets were later returned to the
air with new or modified CFM56-3 engines.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today that industry
insiders say the problem could be the design, manufacture or
materials used in the latest model of the engine _ the CFM56-3C,
introduced on the 737 in October.
   Snecma in France and General Electric in Ohio are testing the
engines to see what went wrong. The two companies manufacture the
engines jointly under the name CFM International.
   GE officials declined to be interviewed. A spokesman for GE said
that its engineers are going over the engines thoroughly and will
not comment until they know the cause of the problem.
   The company has stressed that the engine has a history of
reliability, with an inflight shut-down rate of one in every 20,000
hours of flight, a performance record the industry considers healthy.
   Boeing also has declined to speculate publicly on what caused the
fan blades to break off.
   The CFM56-3C took the basic design of the CFM56-3 and increased
the thrust to 23,500 pounds, 1,500 pounds more than the CFM56-3B
model. Since the problems were discovered, the engines have been
rated to run at the lower thrust level.
   The engines contain 38 titanium fan blades, almost five feet in
diameter, which turn at 5,330 revolutions per minute. Tremendous
stress is put on the blades and the disks that hold them together, a
stress level the CFM56-C3 apparently could not withstand under some
conditions.
   It was a CFM56-3C that failed on a British Midlands jet in
January in a crash that killed 47 people. While the 737 is designed
to be able to fly on one engine, it is thought the pilot shut off
his good engine by mistake after the other caught fire.
Investigators have not yet disclosed what caused the engine to fail
in that plane.
   On June 9 a Dan-Air 737 en route to Minorca, Spain, was forced to
return to London's Gatwick airport because of severe engine
vibration. Two days later a British Midlands 737 flying from London
to Belfast, Northern Ireland, made an emergency landing because of
the same problem.
   While problems with fan blades are not uncommon, insiders say so
many problems so soon in a model's operating history is cause for
concern, the newspaper said.
   On June 13 Boeing took the unprecedented step of asking airlines
to ground planes to check their engines and replace damaged parts.
Airlines also were instructed to reduce the thrust to 22,000 pounds.
The grounding was simultaneously made mandatory for planes under the
jurisdiction of the British Civil Aviation Authority and
subsequently by the Federal Aviation Administration for U.S. planes.
   Inspections showed severe cracking of the fan blades, and in at
least one case, the fan disks.
   ``You just don't expect to have this kind of problem these days
on an operational engine,'' said a professor of aeronautics at a
major U.S. university. ``Normally, problems like this one are
detected during inspections and acted on immediately and fixed
without appearing in the newspaper.''
   This leads insiders to speculate that the breakage was not caused
simply by increased thrust, but by a set of unanticipated conditions
that caused too much vibration, the Post-Intelligencer said.
   Vibration in the fan blades, a harmonic oscillation similar to
the phenomenon of flutter in an airplane's wing, is caused by the
way the air moves around the metal. It is a result of how hard the
engine is run, its temperature and altitude.
   The fact that the fan blades broke during the climb at between
25,000 and 29,000 feet, is therefore also significant.

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said
today it will extend its $120-per-share hostile takeover bid for LIN
Broadcasting Corp. until July 20.
   McCaw said it was considering whether to adjust that offer and
will announce its decision next week. The company reserved the right
to extend the offer beyond July 20.
   The offer was due to expire at midnight Thursday.
   A revision of the takeover bid would reflect LIN's legal loss to
Metromedia Inc. last week over the right to buy Metromedia's
interests in cellular telephone systems in Philadelphia and New
York, McCaw said.
   ``Because the decision appears to bring the Metromedia litigation
to an unfavorable end for LIN, and because its $120-per-share offer
price for LIN stock reflects the possibility of a LIN victory, McCaw
... is now considering whether an adjustment in the offer price
would be appropriate,'' the company said in a prepared statement.
   McCaw said that only a ``nominal percentage'' of outstanding LIN
shares have been tendered to date.
   McCaw's current offer for LIN's outstanding shares is worth $5.85
billion.
   LIN Broadcasting rejected the $120-per-share offer in June.

<HEAD>Business Aviation Recovering From Recession Dive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Break out the Dramamine. Executives are climbing
back into the company planes from which many last alighted in the
early 1980s recession.
   Economic turbulence sent corporate aviation into a nose dive, and
the end of the federal investment tax credit on purchases of company
planes created an additional downdraft for the industry.
   But it's finally showing signs of pulling out, says Robert G.
Carnell, one of seven directors of the National Air Transportation
Association, which represents about 1,500 charter companies and
flight service operations nationally.
   Some companies are going back to private planes to improve their
schedule options and lessen luggage hassles with commercial
airlines. In addition, corporations are leaner, Carnell said, and
``they're trying to have fewer people cover more plants.''
   With a private plane, he said, ``You can go in and out of a plant
in Alabama (from Detroit) in a day. By airlines it's a day and a
half or more.''
   The General Aviation Manufacturers Association in Washington
D.C., said 157 new business jets were delivered in 1988, up 28.7
percent from the 122 delivered in 1987. Sales of turboprops, used
almost exclusively by businesses, were up 10.6 percent in 1988 over
1987, to 291 planes delivered from 263.
   There are other favorable signs.
   Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Travel Data Center
surveys indicate 35 million business travelers were delivered to
destinations by 52,000 corporate and executive aircraft in 1987, the
latest surveys available. That was 2 million more travelers than in
1986.
   ``Overall, it's finally starting to come back after 10 years of
disastrous sales on new airplanes,'' said Carnell, who is president
of Corporate Flight Inc. in Detroit, which manages planes for
corporations.
   About 50 companies keep planes at John Wayne Airport in Orange
County, Calif., and the number remains fairly constant because of
space limitations, said Sue Anderson, manager of Millionnaire flying
service, one of the airport's three fixed-base operators _ companies
that fuel and service corporate and private planes.
   Demand for more space is high. Millionnaire is planning to build
a new hangar scheduled for occupancy in January, Anderson said.
   ``We've got people wanting to put aircraft in that hangar and
we've not even broken ground yet.''
   Millionnaire's fuel sales to private planes, most of them
business planes, have increased from about 1.1 million gallons a
year when the company began five years ago to 1.5 million gallons
last year, she said.
   In the Cleveland area, charters and used aircraft sales picked up
as the economy rallied, said Jim Barber, manager of Mercury Aviation
Inc. at Cuyahoga County Airport, where electronics and auto parts
maker Eaton Corp. and aerospace and defense company TRW Inc. have
air fleets based.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. recently built a new aviation facility and
hangar and Eastman Kodak Co. expanded its facility at Monroe County
Airport near Rochester, N.Y., airport assistant manager Frederick
Iekel said.
   ``Corporate flying is up,'' said Jim Keogh, manager of the Butler
Aviation Inc. facility at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, though he
couldn't provide separate figures on company planes.
   Business flights also are increasing at Detroit's City Airport,
an early corporate aviation center still used by thousands of
company planes.
   ``About half of the Fortune 500 companies land here at least once
a year,'' airport director Lillian Snyder said.
   City Airport counted 137,000 landings and takeoffs last year,
when construction kept the airport closed many nights and weekends.
This year, Snyder said the figure is expected to grow to 170,000.
   Carnell said his company, Corporate Flight, manages planes for a
half-dozen companies, making them available when needed and
chartering them at other times to help pay expenses.
   ``There's no perfect airplane,'' Carnell said. ``A company will
have one plane, maybe a Beech King Air. Occasionally they might need
a Lear Jet. With a group like mine they can interchange and use the
right plane for the right mission.''
   As a rule, about one-third of general aviation aircraft are used
for business, said Richard Lampl of the National Business Aircraft
Association.
   An association survey of its members found that the number of
hours flown per business jet has increased since 1987 from 425.5
hours a year to 441.8 hours a year last year. The association
estimates each jet will be used an average of 483 hours for business
this year.

<TEXT>
   Daimler-Benz, already West Germany's
No. 1 company, is pushing for a merger with an aerospace giant that
would make the conglomerate a major global force in weapons sales
and aviation technology.
   But the proposed merger, the largest and one of the most
controversial in the nation's 40-year history, has run into serious
objections.
   They have ranged from fears of stifled competition to concern
that the resulting defense colossus could end up dictating its own
terms to the government.
   After a veto from the federal cartel office, Economics Minister
Helmut Haussmann must decide whether to override the veto and stands
at the center of what could become one of the most politically
divisive debates of the year.
   Haussmann, whose predecessor helped engineer the proposed deal,
has promised a decision by September.
   If Daimler is allowed to merge with the
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB) group, Germany's largest defense
contractor, the reach of the conglomerate would be immense.
   Daimler-Benz already is a leader in making luxury cars and sturdy
trucks, which officials say will still be a large and vital part of
its operations.
   The merger would create a giant with yearly revenues of almost 80
billion marks (about $42 billion). The conglomerate would rank among
the top 15 aerospace and defense contractors worldwide.
   The conglomerate would have vast holdings in weaponry and defense
electronics, including military aircraft, missiles, engines, tanks
and small naval ships _ areas that Daimler officials believe have
more growth potential than cars and trucks.
   The cartel office in April rejected the proposal on grounds that
it would give Daimler a dominant position in the defense, aerospace
and truck-manufacturing sectors. It also feared the conglomerate's
resulting political clout.
   ``There is a danger that in the long-term Daimler could become so
powerful that it could pressure the government for future
concessions,'' said Hubertus Schoen, a spokesman for the West
Berlin-based cartel office.
   ``Economic power can easily become political power,'' Schoen
said, referring to fears that, with so many defense jobs tied to the
company, it would be hard for the government to turn down lucrative
contracts.
   Schoen said the conglomerate could push smaller companies out of
the running for defense-related contracts.
   Daimler-Benz officials contend those fears are misguided.
   ``We expect the merger to create new outlets for thousands of
suppliers,'' said Friedrich Loesch, a spokesman for the
Stuttgart-based company.
   Daimler officials are quick to note that it was the government
that came to them with the merger proposal nearly two years ago. The
government hopes the deal will ease Bonn's share of the subsidy
burden in Europe's loss-plagued Airbus Industrie consortium, which
manufacturers commercial jets.
   MBB, which is currently 52 percent owned by the states of
Bavaria, Bremen and Hamburg, holds West Germany's 37.9 percent stake
in the Airbus venture.
   Under terms of the Daimler-MBB proposal, the government's only
involvement in the Airbus program after the year 2000 would be in
providing funds for research and development, saving it millions in
future subsidies.
   Economics Ministry officials say that despite Bonn's pledge to
pay subsidies to equal losses from currency fluctuations until the
turn of the century, the gains of privatizing the program are
enormous in the long term.
   Daimler officials say the merger will make West Germany more
competitive in international aerospace research and production.
   ``The West German aviation and aerospace industry is now just too
fragmented to compete well on the international market,'' Loesch
said.
   Combined with Daimler-Benz's existing operations in aviation and
aerospace, the merger would give the auto and truck maker control of
about 60 percent of West Germany's aerospace industry.
   The deal, which initially calls for Daimler-Benz to take a 30
percent interest in MBB, is currently under final review by the
federal monopolies commission. The commission is expected to deliver
its report to the Economic's Ministry in August.
   Economic Minister Haussmann can override the vetoes of both
agencies if he determines that the merger is in West Germany's
``overriding national economic interest.''
   Although government funded, both agencies fulfill independent
watchdog functions.
   Haussmann is under growing pressure to uphold the cartel office
ban, both from within the ruling conservative parties and from the
opposition parties.
   Ulrich Immenga, chairman of the Cologne-based monopolies
commission, acknowledges that Haussmann is in an uncomfortable
position.
   ``The commission will address the awkwardness for the economics
minister in its report,'' Immenga said, referring to charges that
the ministry's decision could be skewed in favor of the merger
because it once helped author the proposal.
   While Haussmann has said his final decision will be based on
objective review of all aspects of the proposal, one of the
minister's top-ranking officials has already irritated members of
the commission and the cartel office by saying publicly that the
negative ruling would likely be set aside.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Soar The Limit On Hot, Dry Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn and soybean futures prices soared their
permitted daily limits Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
forecasts for hot, dry weather in the Midwest, possibly lasting
through the middle of next week.
   The exchange limits daily price movements to 10 cents a bushel in
the corn market and 30 cents a bushel in the soybean pit.
   The run-up extended a rally begun on Monday _ the markets were
closed Tuesday _ and stemmed from a National Weather Service
six-to-10-day forecast issued after the close of trading Monday,
predicting below-normal rainfall in the Corn Belt.
   Analysts said the likelihood that temperatures in the Midwest
will climb above the mid-90s this week bodes ill for the corn crop,
which has entered its pollination phase and requires cooler, wetter
conditions.
   ``Extreme heat with no moisture is an absolute no-no for corn
this time of year,'' said Jerry Zusel, Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
manager of trading-floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   Dry heat won't do much harm to the soybean crop, he said, but the
strong rally in corn triggered heavy buying in all of the
neighboring grain pits.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 7{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.02 a bushel; corn was 8} cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.80} a bushel; oats were 8{ cents
to 9} cents higher with July at $1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 6
cents to 30 cents higher with July at $7.70 a bushel.

   The stock market edged upward in quiet trading
today, rebounding from some early selling as traders returned from
the July 4 holiday.
   Analysts said recent economic reports showing a further slowdown
in business activity over the last couple of months had put
investors in a wary mood.
   They said people who had been enthusiastically embracing hopes
for a ``soft landing'' now have begun to wonder whether something a
bit bumpier might be in store.
   Confirmed optimists on Wall Street argue that the Federal Reserve
will counter any such perils by relaxing its credit policy, giving
the economy a shot of adrenilene and allowing interest rates to fall.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's
policy-setting group, is meeting today and Thursday to consider what
to do next. Evidence of its decisions may be forthcoming soon in the

   The dollar ended sharply lower against all key
currencies in choppy trading Wednesday amid widespread concern that
U.S. interest rates would continue to fall as the economy slows.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, rallied to two-month highs in reaction to
the dollar's weakness.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery jumped $7.30 from late Monday to $388.40 a troy ounce _ the
highest level since late April. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted an ounce of gold at $384.60, up from $377 Monday.
   The domestic financial markets were closed on Tuesday in
observance of the Independence Day holiday.
   Currency dealers said traders were concerned that the Federal
Reserve would further ease its credit policies to prevent the
current economic slowdown from turning into a recession. Lower
interest rates tend to erode the value of a currency.
   The Fed's Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting
Wednesday, and some analysts believe the policy-making group may
soon announce a reduction in the influential discount rate, which is
the interest the central bank charges on loans to member banks.
   That prospect combined with the absence of any particularly
bullish news for the dollar encouraged the dollar selloff Wednesday,
dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.75 Japanese yen to a closing 140.20 yen. It eased
further in London to 138.90 yen, and in New York to 138.40 yen, down
from 141.55 Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose nearly 3 cents to $1.6155, up
from $1.5870 late Tuesday. Sterling bought $1.6285 in New York, up
from $1.5890.
   The dollar reached a two-month low against the West German mark,
breaking the psychologically important 1.90-mark level, dealers said.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.8820 West German marks, down from 1.9217; 1.6115
Swiss francs, down from 1.6470; 1.19085 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1925; 6.3875 French francs, down from 6.5235; and 1,362.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,397.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates Tuesday
included: 1.8907 West German marks, down from 1.9220; 1.6195 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6527; 6.4125 French francs, down from 6.5375;
2.1495 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1710; 1,380.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,393.50; and 1.0909 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1935.
   Gold experts said the dollar's decline made metals more
attractive.
   ``When the market doesn't have confidence in the U.S. dollar the
next best alternative for some people is gold,'' explained Frederick
Demler, a metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $385.50 a troy
ounce, up from $376.50 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to
$384.50 an ounce from $376.50 Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.02 to close at a bid $379.33
an ounce.
   Silver prices were also sharply higher.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.393 a troy ounce, up from $5.230 Monday. Silver rose in London
to $5.38 an ounce from $5.24 Tuesday.

   The government ordered two private trade groups
Wednesday to reconsider sales-promotion trips to China because of
that country's recent bloody crackdown of pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The Department of Trade and Industry and two private trade groups
had said they spent 12 months preparing the sales drives and saw no
reason to break normal commercial links with China.
   But Foreign Office Minister Lord Glenarthur, responding to
widespread criticism from government and opposition lawmakers, told
the House of Lords the visits were being reconsidered.
   After the crackdown by Chinese troops in Tiananmen Square on June
4, the European Economic Community banned ``ministerial and
high-level contacts'' with China.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out full economic
sanctions, but banned arms sales and told the House of Commons
``normal business could not continue with China.''
   Organizers of the two trade missions, which include leaders of
industry and banking, insisted they were not breaking the law but
angry lawmakers criticized the missions and demanded the government
withdraw its support.

<TEXT>
   Crude and home heating oil prices gained while
gasoline prices skidded Wednesday as the energy futures market was
moved largely by supply concerns.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 52 cents to close at $20.79 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The August contract for home heating oil spurted 1.17 cents a
gallon higher to close at 51.06 cents, while wholesale unleaded
gasoline for August delivery dropped 0.35 cent to settle at 57.42
cents a gallon.
   Jim Fiedler, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said crude prices rose on concerns that the flow of oil from
the North Sea could be disrupted by labor problems between oil
companies and maintenance workers and helicopter pilots.
   In the heating oil market, traders bid up contracts believing
that stockpiles have not kept pace with demand, Fiedler said.
   He said gasoline prices fell because the summer driving season
has not been as strong as anticipated and traders were expecting
supply reports _ issued by the American Petroleum Institute after
the close of trading _ to show strong inventories of gas.

<HEAD>Stake in Nation's Largest Gold Mining Firm Likely to Change Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A planned $5.53 billion buyout of Newmont Mining
Corp.'s biggest shareholder likely will mean that nearly half of
Newmont's stock will be up for sale soon, analysts said Thursday.
   British conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC announced late Tuesday that
it had tentatively agreed to acquire Consolidated Gold Fields PLC,
which owns a 49.3 percent stake in Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold
producer.
   Gold Fields raised its holdings in Newmont to 49.3 percent from
26.2 percent in a two-day ``street sweep'' in September 1987 to help
block a hostile takeover by a group led by oilman T. Boone Pickens
Jr. Pickens later dropped his bid for the company following the
purchase and court rulings that supported it.
   The board of directors for Gold Fields, which is involved mainly
in mining and road construction, recommended Tuesday that
shareholders accept the offer by Hanson, which sweetened its
proposal from an initial $4.8 billion bid made June 22.
   Hanson's varied interests include construction materials, the
likely source of the company's interest in Gold Fields, said William
Siedenburg, a New York-based analyst for the investment firm Smith,
Barney.
   ``Hanson doesn't know beans about mining,'' Siedenburg said,
calling it a ``minor possibility'' that Hanson would decide to keep
Gold Fields' Newmont assets, particularly because Newmont recorded
$1.2 billion in debt last year and its income was sagging.
Siedenburg said Hanson more likely would try to sell the Newmont
stake.
   Newmont rose 50 cents to $39.75 a share Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Newmont posted a profit of $9.4 million, or 14 cents a share, in
revenue of $132.2 million in the first quarter of this year. That
compared with a profit of $114.4 million _ including $30.3 million
in one-time gains _ or $1.70 a share on revenue of $92.4 million a
year earlier.
   The company recently announced a complex restructuring of its
Peabody Holding unit, the nation's biggest coal company, that
effectively will transfer some of its debt to Peabody while moving
$500 million in cash from the coal company to Newmont.
   Analyst Ronald Shorr at Bear, Stearns in New York noted that
Hanson had a history of breaking up companies it had acquired, in
order to keep the businesses it considered most useful.
   Consolidated's construction assets ``would fit nicely into some
niche that they (Hanson) have. The mining things do not. It is
likely that they would sell.''
   But, said Shorr, ``It's also true of Hanson that they've not
necessarily been in any great rush to sell things.'' Furthermore,
gold prices are relatively low, so Hanson might prefer to hang on to
Newmont for awhile, he said.
   Under a standstill agreement between Newmont and Gold Fields, the
British company may dispose of its stake in a widely placed public
offering to prevent raiders from acquiring the block and mounting a
new takeover threat.
   Both Shorr and Siedenburg said several parties expressed an
interest in purchasing a stake in Newmont earlier this year when the
South African-controlled Minorco SA investment group made a hostile
bid for Gold Fields.
   A U.S. judge blocked Minorco's bid in April, after Gold Fields
and Newmont filed an antitrust lawsuit to prevent the takeover, and
Minorco later agreed to sell its 29.9 percent stake in Gold Fields
to Hanson.

   A Chinese translation of a special 12-page Los
Angeles Times section ``The Shattered Dream: China 1989'' will be
distributed without charge in California Chinese communities, the
newspaper said Wednesday.
   ``We felt that it was well worth undertaking the logistics of
translation and distribution, given the importance of recent events
in Beijing to the people in Chinese communities throughout the
state,'' said Noel Greenwood, a Times deputy managing editor.
   The news section, distributed June 25 in English, provides
background on events leading up to the recent student protests and
massacre in Tiananmen Square, as well as analysis of the prospects
for China's political future.
   It was the first special news section translated into Chinese by
the Times, Greenwood said.
   Five interpreters spent two days translating the section, which
was then sent to Taiwan via facsimile transmission for typesetting
using a computer that allows high quality generation of Chinese
characters, the paper said.
   The composed pages were then flown to Los Angeles for printing at
the Times plant on July 2.
   Some 55,000 copies of the translated section will be distributed,
starting Thursday, in restaurants, book stores, libraries, grocery
stores and other outlets in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and
Oakland.
   Another 10,000 copies will be mailed to Chinese community leaders
in Southern California.

<HEAD>Surging Corn and Soybeans Lead Broad Rise In Commodity Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn, soybean and oat futures prices soared their permitted daily
limits amid crop-threatening weather forecasts Wednesday, leading a
broad rise in commodity prices on U.S. futures exchanges.
   Prices for future deliveries of wheat, cattle, coffee, precious
metals, and crude oil also rose sharply.
   The exceptions to the rule were just as dramatic: pork and sugar
futures prices plunged.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, most corn contracts settled up the
10-cents-a-bushel limit with the contract for delivery in July,
which is not bound by the price limit, finishing 11} cents higher at
$2.83} a bushel; soybeans were up the 30-cent limit across the board
except for the July contract, which rose 36 cents to $7.76{; oats
were 10 cents to 11 cents higher with July at $1.68 a bushel; wheat
was 5 cents to 9{ cents higher with July at $4.04 a bushel.
   The Board of Trade announced after the close that because of the
limit-up closes in corn, soybeans and oats, the price limits in
those markets would be expanded by 50 percent Thursday through
Monday in accordance with the exchange's rules.
   The run-up extended a rally begun on Monday _ the markets were
closed Tuesday _ and stemmed from a National Weather Service
six-to-10-day forecast issued after the close of trading Monday,
predicting below-normal rainfall in the Corn Belt.
   Analysts said the likelihood of temperatures in the 90s in the
Midwest later this week also bodes ill for the corn crop, which has
entered its pollination phase and requires cooler, wetter conditions.
   ``Extreme heat with no moisture is an absolute no-no for corn
this time of year,'' said Jerry Zusel, Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
manager of trading-floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   Dry heat won't do much harm to the soybean crop in its current
stage of development, he said, but the strong rally in corn
triggered heavy buying in all of the neighboring grain pits.
   Soybean prices also were supported by the growing perception that
extremely wet field conditions in the South and Southeast will
prevent farmers from planting soybeans on land from which winter
wheat is now being harvested, a common practice called
``double-cropping.''
   A new six-to-10 day forecast issued after Wednesday's close
called for the hot, dry pattern in the Corn Belt to continue through
the end of next week.
   Frozen pork futures closed limit-down for the second consecutive
session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the market continued
to reel from last Friday's quarterly Agriculture Department
hogs-and-pigs inventory, which showed fewer animals than the market
had expected.
   Philip Stanley, an independent livestock trader, said the
pork-belly market was likely to drop the 2-cents-a-pound limit at
the start of trading Thursday because of a high number of unfilled
sell orders .
   Live cattle futures rallied late in the session, partly in line
with the surging grain market and partly in a technical rebound from
the losses it had sustained in sympathy with the pork market.
   Live cattle settled .78 cent to 1.28 cents higher with August at
70.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .27 cent
higher with August at 80.62 cents a pound; hogs were the limit 1.50
cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with July at 47.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at
31.85 cents a pound.
   Raw coffee futures rebounded on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, where prices had sunk to eight-year lows Monday following
the collapse of the International Coffee Organization's
price-support system.
   Coffee settled 1.50 cents lower to 3.98 cents higher with July at
$1 a pound.
   Sugar futures fell in technically inspired selling in New York.
Contracts settled .50 cent to 1.01 cents lower with October at 13.46
cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures staged a strong rally on New York's
Commodity Exchange, reacting to the inflationary cues of higher
commodity prices and to the dollar's pronounced weakness Wednesday
against other major currencies.
   Gold settled $7.30 to $8 higher with August at $388.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 16.3 cents to 18 cents higher with July at $5.393
a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid labor uncertainties in the North Sea oil field.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 52 cents
higher with August at $20.79 a barrel; heating oil was .90 cent to
1.17 cents higher with August at 51.06 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .35 cent lower with August at 57.42 cents a
gallon.

   A major U.S. construction firm signed a contract
Wednesday to join in a $47.9 million building project in downtown
Tokyo.
   Morrison-Knudsen International Co. will join with Hazama-Gumi
Ltd., one of Japan's largest civil engineering firms, to build an
18-story office and residential tower for Shuwa Corp., a large
Japanese real estate firm.
   The company, a division of Boise, Idaho-based Morrison-Knudsen
Corp., has established an office in Tokyo and obtained a Japanese
construction permit, which the Ministry of Construction says only
nine U.S. construction firms currently possess.
   Amid complaints that Japan's construction market was closed to
foreign companies, the Japanese government signed an agreement in
May 1988 to allow U.S. companies to participate in public works
projects here.
   Richard E. Kohne, chairman and chief executive officer of
Morrison-Knudsen, said this will be his firm's first project in
Japan, although it has operated in many countries abroad. He said
Morrison-Knudsen would receive between 15 and 35 percent of the work
in the project.
   In looking for a Japanese partner, he added, Morrison-Knudsen
interviewed a dozen potential contractors and chose Hazama because
``they are the closest in traditions and culture with our company.''
   Shuwa President Shigeru Kobayashi said his company had promised
former U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity it would help U.S.
firms participate in the Japanese market.
   During the last two years, Shuwa has actively sought U.S. clients
with the help of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S.
Embassy in Japan, Toshihiko Okino, a spokesman for Shuwa, said.
   The office tower project is Shuwa's second contract with a U.S.
firm for work in Japan. In March, it awarded an 11.2 billion yen,
$80 million, contract to a joint venture between the Turner Corp.
and Kumagai Gumi of Japan.
   Shuwa plans at least two more projects in which it will invite
U.S. firms to participate, Okino added.
   Shuwa also owns $2.5 billion in office and hotel space in the
United States, making it one of the largest Japanese owners of U.S.
real estate.

   Federal officials announced Wednesday that three

   The latest charges bring to 26 the number of people indicted this
year by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force, compared with 23 people in
all of 1988. The task force investigates cases in North Texas, said
Bob Gillham, agent-in-charge of the Dallas FBI office.
   Of those indicted, 20 have been senior officers, owners or vice
presidents of banks or savings and loans, Gillham said.
   The three-count indictment names Bob R. Franks, former president
and director of Northpark Savings Association in Richardson, and
accuses him of scheming to defraud Northpark of funds and
misapplying $138,000 of the thrift's money.
   Franks faces up to 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The three who agreed to plead guilty were:
   _John H. Roberts Jr., former president and owner of Summit
Savings Association of Dallas, to charges of bank fraud and
misapplication of funds. The indictment, filed June 8, alleges he
schemed to defraud Summit of $4.5 million and misapplied $1 million
of Summit funds.
   Federal officials contend Roberts arranged for a borrower to
obtain a loan to buy a jet for Roberts' personal use. The indictment
said Roberts planned to have Summit make a $200,000 downpayment on
the airplane and charge the payment as a draw against a prior $2.5
million construction loan to a Summit borrower, without the
borrower's knowledge or consent.
   Roberts faces up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine or
twice the amount of the gain or loss.
   _Joseph R. Smith, former vice president and loan officer of
Sunbelt Savings Association of Dallas, to one count of conspiracy to
defraud the Federal Home Loan Bank Board by disguising the true
financial condition of Sunbelt's loan portfolio and defrauding the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The indictment alleges Smith received $125,000 from a Sunbelt
real estate transaction but Smith did not report it on his 1985 tax
returns.
   Smith faces up to five years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine or
twice the amount of the gain or loss.
   _Kenneth Clive Hood, former board chairman of Century Investments
and former vice president of Western Savings Association, to two
counts of conspiring to defraud the IRS by creating artificial
losses for Amchase Financial Corp. to offset large income gains.
   Hood also agreed to plead guilty to making a false statement in
connection with an $11.4 million loan from Sunbelt Savings
Association.
   He faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of $500,000.
