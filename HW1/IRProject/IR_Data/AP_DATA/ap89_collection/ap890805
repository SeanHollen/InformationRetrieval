   A researcher who spends his time studying
roadside trash has found that most litterbugs are men.
   Dan Syrek, whose research provided the basis for a cleanup
campaign that cut roadside littering by 60 percent in the state
since 1985, discovered that men did most of the littering, and they
``don't respond positively when you use the word `please' in
telling them to stop.''
   Some Texans found the ``Don't Mess With Texas'' campaign a tad
macho, but it worked, said Syrek, who evaluates roadside litter for
16 state governments.
   With his on-site inspections, Syrek found that men did 70
percent of all deliberate littering, ``and 90 percent of all
accidental littering _ where things fly off the bed of a pickup
truck, for example _ involve male drivers,'' he said. Seventy-five
percent of the men involved were younger than 35.
   The $2 million advertising campaign has included appearances by
country singer Willie Nelson, football players and other
celebrities.
   Studying roadside trash is a good way to see the United States,
Syrek said.
   ``There is some incredibly beautiful countryside that we get to
see in detail,'' said Syrek. ``At least, we do when the litter is
gone.''

   Only three Republicans are left in
this town, jokes the man who started the annual Calvin Coolidge
footrace, ``and one of them is in bad health.'' Luckily, Democrats
are willing to participate.
   The annual 10-kilometer ``I do not choose to run'' honors a
president who was ``more of a man for brisk walks,'' said Paul
Walker of the Greater Northampton Chamber of Commerce.
   ``But Cal hasn't been here for a long time,'' he said. ``And the
T-shirts have become a real collectors item.''
   So prized are the race T-shirts that only the first few hundred
runners to sign up for Sunday's race will get them. The aquamarine
shirt is emblazoned with a drawing of a buttoned-down Coolidge, who
declined to seek a second term in 1928.
   Coolidge, mayor of Northampton in 1909, wouldn't have much of a
constituency now, said Russ A. Kotfila, who started the run as part
of a Coolidgefest in 1983 on the 50th anniversary of the 30th U.S.
president's death.
   ``He was really an amazing, witty man, who held every elected
office from city councilor to mayor to state legislator, governor,
vice president and president. And here, in his adopted home, we
didn't even have a monument.''
   There was opposition to the festival, Kotfila said. ``I think
there may be three Republicans left in town and one of them is in
bad health,'' he said. ``A lot of people found it hard to believe
that we were trying to resurrect Coolidge and thought we should
leave well enough alone.''

   Renewed threats to abortion rights should
be viewed as a significant opportunity to unify the women's
movement, speakers told the National Women's Political Caucus.
   ``We must bring the same spirit to the fight for abortion rights
that we brought to the fight for the ERA (Equal Rights
Amendment),'' Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Georgetown University law
professor, told the caucus' biennial convention on Friday.
   ``That means leaving no state unturned. It means the same grunt
work this caucus did in state after state for the ERA. There is no
shortcut, no magic pill, no easy way,'' she said.
   ``Ironically, despite internal and perhaps inevitable
disagreement over tactics, this issue can and will bring greater
unity.''
   Norton and Bella Abzug, a former Democratic congresswoman from
New York and a founder of the 18-year-old caucus, said they expect
abortion will be the issue that prompts young women to join the
fight for women's rights in numbers not seen since the movement's
peak during the 1970s.
   It presents ``an opportunity to revitalize the movement so it
may complete the mammoth job that remains to secure women their
rights and their freedoms,'' said Norton, former chairwoman of the
Equal Employment Opportunities Commission.
   Norton said the caucus ``must not underestimate the need for a
resilient, confident mass movement of broad appeal if we are to
prevail on the troublesome issue of reproductive choices.''
   But, she added, ``we must avoid the single-issue ... approach of
the anti-choice crowd'' when seeking to stop efforts to impose
abortion restrictions authorized by a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision.
   Abzug said the threat of abortion restrictions will mobilize the
nation's young people like no issue since the Vietnam War:
``Abortion is the Vietnam of this generation for young people
everywhere.''
   A woman's right to decide whether to have children ``free from
intrusion or coercion by government or church or the outright
violence of any individual is as precious and individual a liberty
as the right to speak and the right to believe and the right to
pray,'' Abzug said.
   Without the free exercise of that right, she said, ``no woman
can be deemed to be fully free or equal.''
   ``The idea that the unborn fetus is (entitled to) protection
from the moment of conception is biologically ignorant and
philosophically outrageous,'' Abzug said. ``No civilized nation can
be allowed to declare an unborn fetus to be a person under the
Constitution before women are declared to be persons under the
Constitution.''
   Although the number of women holding elective and appointive
offices has increased during the past two decades, the gains have
been incremental, Abzug said.
   ``At the rate we're going it will take 410 years to get equal
numbers of men and women in the U.S. Congress,'' she said. ``We
have ... allowed ourselves to lower our sights and lower our
demands. I believe we have to begin thinking in new ways.''
   Abzug suggested asking both political parties to commit all open
seats to women until equity is reached in the U.S. House and
pursuing the idea of having one of each state's two U.S. senators
be a woman.

<DATELINE>INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W. Wallace Smith, former president and
prophet of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints, died Friday. He was 88.
   Smith was the grandson of Joseph Smith Jr., founder of the RLDS,
and the father of Wallace B. Smith, the current president of the
church, which has about 1,000 congregations and 150,000 members.
   W. Wallace Smith was ordained the fifth president of the RLDS in
October 1958 and became president-emeritus in 1978. He was replaced
by his son as president.
   The church was formed when the Mormons split into several
factions, the largest of which followed Brigham Young to Salt Lake
City, following religious persecution in 1844.
   Smith expanded the RLDS into other cultures and countries during
his 20 years as president. The church was established in 15
countries when he took over, and congregations opened in 20 more
countries during his tenure.
   In addition to his son, Smith is survived by a daughter, Rosalee
Smith Elser. His wife, Rosamond Bunnell Smith, died in August 1986.
   The church said his body will lie in state in the conference
chamber of the RLDS Auditorium in Independence for public viewing
on Tuesday. Funeral services will be conducted at the auditorium at
10 a.m. Wednesday.

   Singer Billie Holiday and tenor saxophonist
Lester Young were remembered by three singers and three tenor
players at the opening of Lincoln Center's third annual ``Classical
Jazz'' series.
   The first of six concerts, each centered around outstanding
figures from the history of jazz, was sold out Friday night at
Alice Tully Hall.
   The performers were Abby Lincoln with Jimmy Heath, Etta Jones
with Houston Person and Shirley Horn with Buck Hill.
   Miss Lincoln, who had the longest set, has an individual timbre,
sounding not at all like Billie Holiday. Her delivery is warm, open
and generous. She seems a balance of tough and vulnerable and she
seems to be giving of herself. She's mesmerizing, pulling the
audience with her into the world of Billie Holiday's songs.
   Heath and each member of Miss Lincoln's trio stretched out in
interesting solos.
   Etta Jones and Houston Person, who have been performing together
since 1976, have their pattern set with his sax providing melodic
fills between her lines of singing. Miss Jones wraps her words and
syllables around the instrumental music, the way Miss Holiday did.
   She also had a trio on stage. Pianist David Braham captured the
imagination.
   Shirley Horn played her own piano accompaniment, with bassist
and drummer. Buck Hill played saxophone with them on every other
song. Miss Horn's approach is lightness. If the other two singers
were airplanes, she was a glider, touching down occasionally. Then
right away, and in no hurry, she'd lift off again.

   Hurricane Dean drifted northward Friday in the open
Atlantic Ocean after veering away from northern Caribbean islands
and the southeastern Bahamas, forecasters said.
   ``It may strengthen a little bit. There are changes that are
taking place around it,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Dean's winds of 85 mph were centered near
23.0 north latitude and 64.91 west longitude, about 600 miles
southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane was moving north at about 12
mph, forecasters said.
   ``Our latest reconnaissance positions indicate that indeed it
may start a little bit more fast speed toward the north, and you
can see that on the satellite,'' Sheets said.
   A weakening of upper atmosphere currents that steer the storm
kept Dean away from the islands Thursday, after it initially headed
toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
   The hurricane was moving very slowly.
   ``We're still expecting it to turn to the north and then
eventually go to the northeast,'' said forecaster Jim Gross. Asked
about the storm's potential for hitting Bermuda in about three
days, he said: ``They're very easy to miss.''
   The second hurricane of the Atlantic season became a tropical
storm Monday night and was reclassified a hurricane Tuesday when
its maximum sustained wind speed passed 74 mph.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported
Friday that jurors found divorce attorney Marvin Mitchelson
innocent in a civil lawsuit filed by a former client who had
accused him of legal malpractice in her 1984 divorce case.
   The verdict was actually a two-part ruling.
   Jurors found that Mitchelson had failed to exercise the care and
skill ordinarily used by an attorney in such cases. But the jury
refused to assess any damages against Mitchelson, ruling that his
failure had not injured his former client.
   In a separate finding, jurors denied a counter-suit filed by
Mitchelson seeking unpaid legal fees for handling the divorce case.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Groups Regain Offensive With Defiance Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sidestepping an array of
state-of-emergency bans, the militant core of the anti-apartheid
movement is back on the offensive with a defiance campaign that has
government leaders groping for a response.
   Crushing the campaign by force could wreck the government's
ongoing initiatives to improve its international standing. Allowing
unchecked civil disobedience could fuel widespread black activism
and a white backlash against the governing National Party in
advance of parliamentary elections next month.
   The campaign, launched Wednesday when about 270 blacks and
Indians sought and received treatment at segregated white
hospitals, is led by many of the activists who have been detained
or restricted during the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   ``People have decided to take the matter into their own hands,''
said Essa Moosa, a lawyer involved in the campaign.
   The campaign's leaders have designated themselves and their
various organizations as the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose
alliance which in effect takes the place of the United Democratic
Front. The UDF was banned in February 1988, and by late last year,
activists were conceding that the emergency crackdown had seriously
weakened their organizational prowess.
   The first sign of a resurgence came in January, when UDF
affiliates helped organize hunger strikes by hundreds of detained
black activists. Faced with the prospect of detainees starving to
death without ever being charged, the government chose to free
virtually all those held under emergency regulations.
   Now comes the defiance campaign, which envisions the first
sustained use of mass civil disobedience in South Africa since the
1950s. Its masterminds are activists who have proved their
resilience and persistence.
   Two of the Mass Democratic Movement's key leaders are Murphy
Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, UDF officials who escaped from
detention to sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate last year. The
government allowed them to emerge without the restrictions imposed
on many other UDF leaders.
   Another key component of the new movement is the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation, which
has defied a government decree barring it from political activity.
   The government may have trouble responding decisively to the
defiance campaign because of a partial power vaccuum at the top.
President P.W. Botha will retire after the Sept. 6 election, and
neither he nor his designated successor, F.W. de Klerk, has been
eager to make bold moves in recent weeks.
   The government's point man in coping with the defiance campaign
is Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. He asserted last month the
organizers sought to provoke violence and had endorsed hand-grenade
attacks on election candidates.
   The Mass Democratic Movement denied the allegations and mocked
Vlok after the hospital protest proceeded peacefully, with minimal
disruption to health services.
   Vlok belittled the protest as ``political pestering'' but said
further acts of defiance ``are a time-bomb that could explode at
any moment.''
   Health Minister Willie van Niekerk complained that sick blacks
had been used as pawns and said no hospitals elsewhere in ``the
civilized world'' would be targeted by protesters. Anti-apartheid
leaders agreed, saying no civilized country's hospitals would be
racially segregated.
   The Mass Democratic Movement says the defiance campaign will be
extended soon to other targets, possibly segregated schools and
recreation facilities. Mineworkers have begun protesting workplace
segregation and 17 former detainees in Cape Town said they would
defy the restrictions imposed when they were freed.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, conceded in an
editorial Friday the activists ``scored a propaganda victory,
highlighting segregation at white hospitals, issuing defiant
statements and challenging the authorities without suffering any
serious consequences.''
   The Citizen said the government might regret its decision to
avoid a pre-emptive crackdown on the protest's organizers.
   The government's dilemma has been aggravated by the fact that
its current policy documents repudiate racial discrimination. Vlok
himself declared during the week that ``apartheid is no longer the
policy of the National Party.''
   If Vlok was speaking the truth, said Morobe, then the defiance
campaign would only be of help.

<HEAD>Dozens Injured When Crowd Presses into Concert Grandstand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50 people were injured when a
crowd trying to get into a standing-room-only area for a Friday
evening grandstand concert at the Ohio State Fair pressed into the
area before it was opened.
   State Highway Patrol troopers at the scene said most of the
injuries were minor. Shane Jenkins, director of public relations,
said 58 people were treated at the fair; about a dozen later were
taken to hospitals.
   Doctors' Hospital North nursing supervisor Melanie Crader said
eight teen-agers were treated for minor injuries. ``I think there
was one broken foot, but it was pretty minor stuff. There were
varying complaints,'' she said.
   After the disturbance, Gov. Richard F. Celeste met with fair
officials and managers of the acts scheduled to appear Friday night.
   Following the meeting, the manager for one of the acts, New Kids
on the Block, announced that the entertainment would be presented
one act at a time, and if authorities felt the crowd was getting
unruly, the rest of the show would be canceled.
   After the announcement, Celeste walked along the perimeter of
the grandstand, telling concertgoers to ``Be cool and pass it
back.''
   Trooper Gary Esslinger said he could not estimate the size of
the crowd for the 8 p.m. concert. The crowd had been building all
day, and the grandstand was largely filled by late afternoon,
witnesses said.
   The standing-room-only area had not been opened when the crowd
broke for the seats, witnesses said. A thunderstorm broke shortly
after the crowd rushed into the area, adding to the confusion.

   Congress passed and sent to President Bush
early Saturday a landmark savings and loan bailout providing tens
of billions of dollars to cover the losses of savers whose deposits
disappeared in a wave of fraudulent lending.
   By 201-175, the House passed the $159 billion financial rescue _
the biggest in the nation's history _ following a frantic 48 hours
of negotiations between Congress and the Bush administration.
   The Senate approved the measure only two hours earlier, giving
President Bush a victory on his first and biggest legislative
initiative since taking office last January as Congress recesses
for a month. Bush had agreed in advance to the compromise, the
second in as many days.
   The bill provides $50 billion over the next three years to close
and merge 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off savers whose billions of
dollars in government insured deposits were lost to failed and
often fraudulent loans, most of them in Texas.
   It also totally overhauls the regulation of the industry to try
to fulfill Bush's promise that ``never again'' will taxpayers be
asked to pay for losses. S&amp;L owners will be required to put
billions of dollars more of their own money at risk as a buffer
between risky loans and the federal deposit insurance funds.
   The administration lobbied House Republicans throughout the day
to provide the winning margin as Democrats defected from the bill
in large numbers in response to a compromise hiding most of the
cleanup costs off the budget and out of the official federal
deficit.
   Republicans in the House supported the bill 119-40 while
Democrats opposed it 135-82. Fifty-one members did not vote and
five voted ``present.''
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., accused House members of losing their
conscience and their backbone in bowing to a veto threat from Bush
and agreeing to financing the bulk of the bailout's costs through
30-year bonds.
   ``It should have been paid for by taxes, but the president could
not bring himself to say the word,'' said Gibbons. ``So we have
fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and
grandchildren.''
   But with the losses of federally insured deposits mounting at a
rate of $20 million to $30 million a day, supporters said it would
be equally unconscionable for Congress to go on vacation without
fixing the problem.
   ``I for one don't want to take the chance of another
bank-holiday crisis,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, referring
to the wave of bank closings at the end of the Hoover
administration in early 1933 that deepened the Great Depression.
   ``The alternative are unthinkable,'' added Rep. Steve Bartlett,
R-Texas.
   ``The savings of million of Americans are at stake unless we do
something,'' Sen. Christopher Bond, D-Mo., said just before the
unusual ``divison'' vote in which supporters and opponents indicate
their position by standing.
   The procedure leaves no record of who votes yes or no. But four
senators stood in opposition and three others asked to be recorded
as opponents. They were Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Kent Conrad,
D-N.D.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; James Exon, D-Neb.; Wendell Ford,
D-Ky.; John Warner, R-Va., and Jay Rockefeller, R-W.Va.
   ``I think it is the best bill possible to craft under the
circumstances,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee. ``It will make major reforms in every
area.''
   President Bush was on the phone with House members from both
parties throughout the day, according to sources, pleading for
support. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was dispatched to
the Capitol Hill to negotiate a resolve to the impasse.
   Brady, a former appointed Republican senator from New Jersey,
spent nearly an hour on the Senate floor lobbying former colleagues.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell took the bill the Senate
floor only after Brady and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, reached an accord on
off-budget bonds.
   Dingell had demanded that the off-budget bonds to be used for
much of the financing be registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as carrying a risk higher than normal
government securities. He and Brady agreed that the SEC may demand
full disclosure to investors of risks but the bill does not require
registration.
   Dingell earlier Friday joined with three other committee
chairmen to oppose the Thursday accord _ Reps. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., Leon Panetta, D-Calif. and John Conyers, D-Mich.. Dingell
leads the Energy and Commerce Committee; Rostenskowski chairs Ways
and Means; Panetta is in charge of Budget and Conyers heads
Government Operations.

   The crowd of people seeking favors from former
Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. included his successor and one
of his most vocal critics in Congress, according to reports
published Friday.
   Four-dozen boxes of documents from Pierce's eight-year tenure at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development contained mounds of
requests for his time or help, the reports said.
   The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal, citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act, report that Pierce became involved in selected cases at the
behest of political associates.
   In testimony before a congressional subcommittee in May, Pierce
said he didn't do special favors for consultants or developers and
had merely instructed subordinates to give personal requests
``careful consideration.''
   Among the documents released to the newspapers were numerous
letters asking Pierce for help or thanking him for the department's
approval of one project or another. The reports did not specify in
every case whether Pierce himself interceded on behalf of those who
sought his help.
   According to the Journal, among those who wrote Pierce were Jack
Kemp, the current HUD secretary who at the time was a congressman
from New York; former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger; Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.; and Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat who has been one of the most outspoken critics in Congress
of the influence peddling that existed at HUD during Pierce's
tenure.
   In its Saturday editions, the Times said the documents also
showed HUD officials withheld from Congress records that showed the
extent of political favoritism in the award of federal subsidies
for low-income housing.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., asked HUD in early 1988 for two years of
records on the awarding of the subsidies. The documents show Heinz
was given data only for a four-month period after the program had
been revised to curb political abuses, the Times said.
   The newspapers quoted a letter from James Watt, in which the
former interior secretary thanked Pierce for his support of a
suburban Baltimore housing project that was awarded $28 million in
Section 8 moderate rehabilitation funds in May 1986.
   Watt was paid $300,000 by the developer of the project to help
obtain money from Housing and Urban Development and, according to
previous testimony, had met with Pierce to discuss the project.
   ``Thanks!'' Watt wrote to Pierce on June 6, 1986. ``You are a
man of your word.''
   Asked for comment by the Times, Watt referred to his
congressional testimony last spring in which he said his contacts
with Pierce were proper.
   Pierce faces no charges of wrongdoing, but congressional
investigators have questioned the truthfulness of some of his
testimony. The Post said Pierce could not be reached for comment.

   A judge has issued a succinct order to the
creators of a parody of Cliff's Notes, the yellow-and-black
booklets that have aided generations of struggling students by
condensing Hemingway, Shakespeare and Milton:
   Change it.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram ruled this week that the
upcoming satire looks too much like the real thing, and that the
parodists cannot use any cover that might be confused with Cliff's
Notes.
   The decision was described as unprecedented by Kathy Trager,
lawyer for the parody's publisher, Doubleday. She moved to seek an
expedited appeal of the ruling, as well as an immediate stay.
   ``If this ruling is upheld, it will deal a significant blow to
free speech and First Amendment liberties and will endanger the
viability of parody as a literary form,'' said Nancy Evans,
president and publisher of Doubleday.
   Ms. Trager said that although the judge did not enjoin the
production of any parody, her restrictions on the cover meant
exactly that. Recreating the appearance of the subject is ``the
essence of parody,'' she said, and a parody of Cliff's Notes
without a yellow-and-black cover would be like a parody of Time
magazine without a red border up front.
   The satire, ``Spy Notes,'' was produced by the editors of Spy
magazine, a brash New York humor monthly, and was to reach
bookstore shelves next month.
   It ridicules and boils down trendy best sellers like ``Bright
Lights, Big City,'' ``Slaves of New York'' and ``Less Than Zero.''
Like this on ``Less Than Zero'' _ ``Clay meets Trent and Rip at a
nightclub called The Roxy. Ross takes them all to see a dead body
in an alleyway. Then they all go to Rip's house, where there is a
delirious, naked 12-year-old girl tied to a bed.''
   It also offers ``Questions for Review,'' ``Biographical Notes''
and ``Suggestions for Further Reading,'' mostly a listing of
gossip-column appearances of authors Bret Easton Ellis, Jay
McInerney and Tama Janowitz.
   The cover is yellow with black stripes, and the titles of the
``summarized'' works are in the same block letters used on Cliff's
Notes covers. But instead of the mountain depicted in the lower
right corner of real Cliff's Notes, Spy Notes features a Manhattan
skyline.
   In addition, the words ``A SATIRE'' are printed nine times in
pink letters on the Spy Notes cover.
   After Cliff's Notes Inc. learned of Spy's plans, the company
went to court to seek an injunction against the parody's cover.
Cliff's claimed the parody was a trademark violation which would
confuse the public.
   The company's product has been used by generations of college
and high school students who either failed to read assigned works
or failed to understand them. In its complaint, Cliff's Notes noted
``the excellence of its literary works'' gave it ``an outstanding
reputation and acceptance among members of the public throughout
the United States.''
   The judge said she disagreed with Doubleday's theory that ``the
First Amendment gives the parodist unbridled freedom to use a
registered trademark as part of a parody or satire.''
   She found that the Spy Notes cover design and Cliff's Notes
trademark cover ``are similar to a degree that would cause consumer
confusion.''
   ``Consumers could believe that Cliff's was satirizing Spy, that
Spy was a division of Cliff's, or that Cliff's licensed Spy,'' she
said.
   The judge agreed with Cliff's that Spy Notes ``goes far beyond
`conjuring up' the Cliff's Notes image, and instead merely copies
it with minor differences added in an attempt to avoid trademark
violations.''
   William M. Hart, lawyer for Cliff's, said his client ``is as
much entitled to the First Amendment protection as Doubleday is. It
would be a perverse injustice if someone in the name of the First
Amendment was able to take a trademarked cover design and be immune
from liability.''
   Kurt Andersen, co-editor of Spy, said the judge's ruling defied
understanding. ``It's a shocking and puzzling decision ...,'' he
said. ``I don't see how anyone could possibly confuse the two.''

<HEAD>New Early-Diagnosis Test Finds AIDS Virus Instead of Body's Reaction</HEAD>

   Abbott Laboratories is marketing a new test that
detects the AIDS virus rather than the body's response to the virus
and can reveal infection weeks earlier than currently used tests,
the company said Friday.
   AIDS-virus tests now in use detect the presence of antibodies _
proteins manufactured by white blood cells to fight invading
organisms. Antibodies usually appear in a person's system six to 10
weeks after infection.
   The new test detects AIDS antigens _ proteins on the surface of
the invading virus. The new test can signal the presence of the
antigens about two weeks after infection, a spokesman for the North
Chicago-based company said.
   `This test complements the antibody test. It does not replace
the antibody test,'' said Dr. Harold Kessler, associate professor
of medicine and director of the HIV treatment program at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
   Test was approved Thursday for commercial sale by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, making it the only approved test for the
AIDS virus in the country.
   Though antigens are the first detectable sign of infection, they
effectively ``disappear'' with the appearance of antibodies, which
remain in the body. The antigen test is thus not always able to
reveal the presence of infection.
   Antigens only reappear when the virus becomes more active, a
possible signal that the infected person will get sick, either with
immune problems, with a mild form of AIDS known as AIDS-related
complex or with full-blown AIDS, said Kessler.
   To identify which infected people are likely to develop symptoms
_ some may be infected for years without any symptoms _ doctors can
check patients with the new test every three or four months, said
Abbott spokesman Charles Weber.
   ``If you come up where the antigen test is positive, that might
be the opportune moment to intervene with AZT or some form of
antiviral therapy,'' Weber said. AZT, or zidovudine, is the only
drug approved by the FDA for fighting AIDS.
   Kessler said antigen-positive patients have a 75 percent chance
of developing symptoms, compared with 29 percent for
antigen-negative patients.
   The new test, available under the trade name HIV AG-1, is
already under manufacture because is has previously been used to
monitor the effectiveness of AZT. It will continue to be valuable
for that purpose, Kessler said.
   Kessler said the test will probably cost $100 to $120 at the
lab, which is ``not out of line'' with other laboratory tests for
viruses.

   Congress approved an historic savings and loan
rescue plan early Saturday after the Democratic-controlled House
overwhelmingly approved a $286.5 billion military spending bill,
ignoring President Bush's veto threat.
   In the rush to complete its work before a monthlong recess, the
Senate passed the compromise $159 billion savings and loan bailout
plan and sent it to the House. The S&amp;L vote in the Senate on
President Bush's first and biggest legislative initiative was
anti-climactic, without even a roll call. A sharply divided House
passed the bill 201-175 just moments after midnight.
   At the outset of its more than 15-hour lawmaking marathon, the
House voted 312-105 to adopt military appropriations legislation.
The measure would cut $1.8 billion from Star Wars, strictly curtail
production of the B-2 bomber and eliminate all funds for the
Midgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tactical fighter and cruise
missile. President Bush has threatened to veto the bill.
   The Senate also passed legislation on financial liability for
oil spills, aid to farmers hit by the drought and a temporary $70
billion extension to the $2.8 trillion federal debt limit, which
the House had approved earlier.
   While Congress pushed for speedy action on a series of bills,
Bush complained to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
about Senate delays on 120 of his appointments.
   ``The president wanted to register his deep concern that these
were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the
candidates themselves,'' presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters at the White House.
   The ``artificial reasons,'' according to administration
officials and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., are party
politics.
   Among the nominations the Senate has not yet acted on are Bush's
selection of Donald Gregg, who has been linked to the Iran-Contra
affair, as ambassador to South Korea and several nominees to the
scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Away from the legislative action and White House complaints, the
House ethics committee said it had decided to investigate three
lawmakers accused of sexual improprieties.
   The committee voted in secret session Thursday to conduct
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.;
Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif.
   Lukens was convicted in Ohio on a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the unruliness of a child. He was sentenced June 30
to 180 days in jail and fined $1,000 for having sex with a teen-age
girl.
   Two former aides to Bates have filed a complaint alleging he
sexually harassed female members of his staff. Three Democrats
filed a complaint against Savage after news reports said a Peace
Corps volunteer complained the congressman fondled her while he was
traveling in Zaire.
   Sen. David Durenberger, D-Minn., disclosed that the Senate
ethics committee has completed a preliminary inquiry of his
previously disclosed book contract that an opponent claimed was a
device to circumvent limits on fee income. The senator said the
committee had decided to proceed with its investigation.
   The last major legislative battle before the recess concerned
the thrift bailout.
   A tenuous compromise with the Bush administration, agreed to
late Thursday night, was threatened as key House Democrats
announced opposition. In particular, they objected to financing
provisions that would keep much of the cost of the bailout outs they
said, add
substantially to the overall expense to be borne by taxpayers.
   With savings and loan losses mounting at a rate of $20 million
or more a day, Bush wrote to the lawmakers, ``Final passage remains
critical to the stability and solvency of the financial system.''
   The landmark bill would close or merge hundreds of insolvent
savings institutions.
   Setting the stage for the difficult task of deciding the S&amp;L
bailout, the House moved quickly on the defense appropriations bill
that largely conformed to the military authorization plan passed by
the chamber last week.
   Despite word from the White House budget office that the
president's senior advisers would recommend a veto, and a similar
assessment from the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee, the chamber gave overwhelming approval to the plan.
   In fact, the vote for the appropriations plan _ 312-105 _
amounted to a stronger statement than the 261-162 approval of the
authorization bill.
   ``They have conformed,'' Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama,
ranking GOP member on Armed Services, said of the two pieces of
legislation. ``But that still makes it veto-bait in my opinion.''
   Dickinson said he hoped that when members of the Senate and
House meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill,
the ``most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified and
limited to make it acceptable to the administration.''
   Among the other final-day action taken by Congress:
   _The Senate voted 99-0 to increase industry's financial
liability for oil spills, create a nationwide system to clean up
such accidents and establish a $1 billion trust fund to help
compensate for damages. The vote came less than five months after
the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of oil.
   _The House and Senate approved a compromise plan providing $895
million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the drought
and other weather-related problems. Bush administration officials
have indicated that the president will sign the legislation.

<HEAD>HRS Workers Punished in 2-Year-Old's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three state child-welfare workers were
suspended and a fourth has quit following the death of a 2-year-old
boy whose parents allegedly dunked him repeatedly in a toilet for
soiling his diapers.
   The workers ignored guidelines in returning Bradley McGee to his
mother and stepfather, ignoring warnings that they were abusing the
boy, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services said
Friday.
   Bradley died of a brain hemorrhage July 28, shortly after the
HRS workers returned the boy to his parents from foster care.
   Sheryl McGee Coe, 20, and Thomas Edward Coe, 22, both of
Lakeland, were held without bond Friday facing first-degree murder
charges in the case.
   HRS Secretary Gregory Coler said he was upset that the staffers
recommended the child be returned to the Coes despite the abuse
reports and their failure to fulfill an agreement to attend
drug-abuse counseling.
   ``We're not talking about facts that weren't known or somebody
who didn't show up somewhere or that the information wasn't
there,'' Coler said Thursday, the day of Bradley's funeral. ``We're
talking about people not following procedure.''
   Bradley was taken from the Coes' custody in March 1988 after HRS
officials said the Coes had been negligent. He was returned to them
in late May despite the warnings of Bradley's foster parents, the
Kirklands.
   The foster parents said they repeatedly told HRS workers that
they feared Bradley would be in danger if returned to the Coes.
   Three child-welfare workers involved in the case, case worker
Margaret Barber, her supervisor Judy Ross, and subdistrict
administrator Tom McFadyen, have been put on a 10-day, paid leave.
Case worker Shirley DuBoise quit, HRS spokesman Steve Konicki said
Thursday.
   After a closed meeting Friday with angry parents in Tampa, HRS
district administrator Tom Weinberg said HRS has ``got to intensify
the review effort of supervisors in high-level supervision, so we
fully understand the complexities in the case.''
   The parents who requested the meeting have been protesting for
the past several days in Tampa with placards in the downtown area,
criticizing HRS' handling of such cases.
   They also held a candlelight ceremony along the Tampa riverfront
Thursday night on behalf of Bradley and other child-abuse victims.

   A $3.1 million judgment won by the widow of
an Air Force pilot killed in an F-16 jet crash in South Korea more
than six years ago has been overturned by a three-judge federal
appeals court panel.
   The widow, Janet Harduvel of Lutz, can petition the full 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the case. If the
request is refused, she has said she plans to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell served on the
appellate panel and wrote its opinion released Monday.
   The judgment was rendered by a U.S. District Court jury in April
1987 against General Dynamics, the F-16 fighter jet contractor, on
the grounds that the plane was defectively designed and
manufactured.
   Mrs. Harduvel's attorney, Howard Acosta, told the appeals panel
the plane had a severe electrical malfunction causing the crash
into a mountain that killed Capt. Ed Harduvel in November 1982.
   Mark Dumbroff, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney representing
General Dynamics, asked for a reversal, contending the crash was a
result of pilot error.
   The panel rejected the argument that there were defects in the
designing and building of the Air Force's newest jet fighter and
overturned the lower court verdict.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Fabrication of Quotes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A psychologist intends to appeal a federal
court ruling that allows a journalist quoting a public figure to
make up a quote if the quote does not ``alter the substantive
content'' of what was said.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that
Jeffrey Masson, a former director of the Freud Archives, could not
sue writer Janet Malcolm for $10.2 million over a New Yorker
magazine article and book that allegedly quoted him as saying many
things he never said.
   The purported quotes included Masson's self-description as an
``intellectual gigolo,'' his comment that after Sigmund Freud he
would be regarded as ``the greatest analyst who ever lived,'' and a
statement that he would have turned the Freud house into ``a place
of sex, women, fun.''
   In a libel suit by a public figure, who must prove that harmful
statements were deliberately or recklessly false, quotations can be
fabricated if they are ``rational interpretations of ambiguous
remarks'' or ``do not alter the substantive content of unambiguous
remarks,'' said the opinion by Judge Arthur Alarcon. He was joined
in his opinion by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall.
   But the dissenter in the 2-1 decision, Judge Alex Kozinski, said
fabricated quotes were the equivalent of lies.
   ``If authors are given license to invent quotations on the basis
of what they perceive to be a speaker's character, there are no
words whatsoever that they cannot put into a subject's mouth,''
Kozinski said.
   Karl Olson, lawyer for Malcolm and her publishers, said the
ruling vindicates his clients. He said they never conceded that any
quotes had been made up or changed, other than ``a word here and a
word there.''
   Paul Kleven, a lawyer for Masson, said the ruling would be
appealed.
   ``We don't think there's any need to allow that sort of
alteration to protect the values that the First Amendment is
designed to protect,'' he said.
   Masson, a Berkeley resident, was fired in 1981 as director of
the New York-based Freud Archives.
   He said he was fired and fell out of favor among psychoanalysts
because he had written that Freud, the father of modern
pscyhoanalysis, knew the evidence was to the contrary when he
declared that women usually fantasized claims of childhood sexual
abuse.
   His suit attacked Malcolm's 1983 New Yorker article, ``Trouble
in the Archives,'' and her 1984 book, ``In the Freud Archives,'' on
the struggle between Masson and directors of the archives over his
views on Freud.
   Masson said Malcolm had maliciously painted a false picture of
him by fabricating quotes, citing numerous statements that were not
in her tape-recorded interviews. He also said he notified the New
Yorker and the book publisher of the fabrications before
publication.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Lynch dismissed the suit in 1987. An
appeals court upheld his ruling.
   Kozinski, in his dissent, said the quotes distorted Masson's
taped statements: for example, he never called himself the greatest
analyst, just the only one who held his views. In addition,
Kozinski said, journalists are supposed to vouch for the accuracy
of the quotes they use.
   He also quoted William Shawn, editor of the New Yorker at the
time of Malcolm's articles, as calling the magazine ``the most
accurate publication not only in this country, but in the entire
world.''

   Excerpts from the prayer sermon by new

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   One of the most vociferous, revealing and at the same time very
ugly events this week took place in Lebanon. This can reveal the
face of the hegemonistic powers of the world.
   See how ugly the issue is.
   A country by the name of Israel, which is from the root up an
usurper, officially enters a town with military forces, with a
helicopter, and takes the Friday prayer leader of the town along
with two of his security men.
   This is not at all acceptable by any international standard, and
no country can say this is right. No international law can condone
this action.
   A country cannot enter another country, kidnap and leave ... and
then confess to it.
   OK, it used to do this and not confess, it would deny it.
   This wasn't boastfulness. It was a crime, but not boasting.
   But it confessed. It announced. This is to make a laughingstock
of all those individuals who adhere by international laws.
   What happened in return?
   Some innocent people, whose identity isn't even known. A number
of unknown people combating covertly, announced that a person they
had (been keeping) as a spy had been killed. They hanged him in
revenge. Their reason was that Israel is America's agent, and we
will take our revenge on this American person whom we have captive,
and who is implicated in Israel's crime, in return for Mr. Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid. This was what they said.
   Then they threatened that they would kill the rest (of the
hostages) too, if you don't free Obeid. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   So what should we do in this situation?
   Here there is one clear point and a somber point:
   The clear point is that a government has officially confessed,
confessed to all about its crime.
   The somber point is that a group has killed someone, who may be
innocent, but we don't know, therefore we will not make any
judgment on this. We don't even know who he is, and so we don't
make any judgment.
   And we don't know this group either, whether they are righteous
people or not, who they are. We only know only that the people of
Lebanon are innocent people. And innocent people cannot be
condemned without reason. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Global arrogance (The United States), if it wanted to do
something, it would have been clear:
   It should take Israel by the collar and say free Sheik Obeid so
that the issue is finished.
   If you take a criminal and ask him to stop his crimes, this is
popular in the world.
   They might say, ``No, this doesn't concern us and we are no
match for Israel.'' This is not acceptable to us. No one accepts
this. Israel itself does not accept this, the people of America
don't accept this. If America really wants to stop Israel it must
announce, it must say, ``Until Sheik Obeid is freed American aid
will be stopped.''
   This Congress that convenes in America, these bigwigs that sit
and vote there, this is the way you should vote.
   Why do you think so crookedly, and speak so arrogantly? Instead
of going after a self-confessed, known, boastful criminal, you
order that your warships gather from around the world toward
innocent Lebanon. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What kind of idiots are you?
   See how ugly the world is? See how the idiotic are the
politicians who rule the world?
   If they want to solve the problems of Lebanon there are ways,
the ways are clear; they don't want to solve the problems, they are
not prepared to stop backing Maronite rule in Lebanon.
   They are still hoping, waiting for the day to have a Maronite
Israel in Lebanon. One Jewish Israel in Palestine, one Maronite
Israel in Lebanon. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I state, I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has
solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable,
prudent solutions.
   These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve
the problems. Come let us enter reasonably, we too will help solve
the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace
and harmony.

   The Bush administration is in a ``holding
pattern'' as it pins its hopes on continued diplomatic efforts to
resolve the crisis involving hostages held by Moslem extremists, an
official said.
   The administration on Friday voiced optimism, tinged with
caution, at the promise of Iran's new president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, to help find a solution to the hostage situation.
   President Bush said he would explore the overture ``to the
fullest.''
   ``I don't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment, but there's
reason to be somewhat encouraged,'' Bush said about Rafsanjani's
comments.
   Still, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States is ``always skeptical of what we hear from Iran,'' while
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler sounded a slightly
more positive reaction.
   ``Based on the excerpts we have seen, President Rafsanjani's
remarks appear to be moderate and are therefore encouraging,'' she
said. ``We have reason to believe that Iran is genuinely engaged
and no reason to believe that its engagement is not focused in a
positive direction.''
   The United States, which does not have direct relations with
Iran, was using Switzerland as an intermediary to seek help from
Iran, generally believed to wield influence with the Shiite
kidnappers, officials said.
   The president also called the head of the Geneva-based
International Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, on Friday to voice
support for the agency's involvement in trying to free the
hostages, said Fitzwater.
   Efforts by the Red Cross were alluded to by Rafsanjani when he
said he would help the United States find solutions.
   Bush spoke of a ``very extraordinarily broad exercise of
diplomacy here in the last couple of days'' during which aides said
he has appealed to dozens of world leaders for help.
   The diplomatic efforts are continuing, Fitzwater said.
   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``It's in a holding pattern,'' while the
administration watches for its diplomatic overtures to produce
results. No new messages went to Iran on Friday, the official said.
   During a photo session, Bush was asked about the massing of U.S.
naval strength in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean as a
possible indicator he had decided to retaliate militarily if
another U.S. hostage was killed.
   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last
place I'd be talking about it,'' Bush said.
   But Fitzwater denied Bush had selected specific Lebanese targets
to hit if kidnappers had carried out a threat to kill American
hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   ``I will say he did not make final decisions,'' Fitzwater said.
``It does not help the United States government or the United
States to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing our
muscles in public.''
   Bush was he was ``certainly pleased'' that the kidnappers on
Thursday indefinitely suspended their death threat against Cicippio.
   ``I'm encouraged. But I don't want to get the hopes of the
hostages' loved ones up once again, to have those hopes dashed.
This is a brutal process, where you see people paraded before
cameras and their families get their hopes up,'' the president said.

   Congress capped a pre-vacation flurry of
fiscal action by giving final approval of a bailout for the savings
and loan industry early today and by granting President Bush's
request for an increase in the national debt limit.
   After weeks of intense wrangling and a last-minute legislative
showdown, the Senate approved the S&amp;L bill without a roll call.
Shortly after midnight, the House then sent the package to Bush on
a narrow 201-175 vote, with most of the chamber's ruling Democrats
voting against.
   Bush is expected to sign the 1,000-page legislation, which would
overhaul the thrift industry.
   One of the biggest hangups on the S&amp;L bill was its impact on the
federal deficit and Bush's plan to keep the $159 billion cost
``off-budget.'' Bush won a compromise from the
Democratic-controlled Congress by threatening a veto.
   The Senate also gave voice vote approval and sent to Bush a bill
temporarily adding $70 billion in new borrowing authority to the
Treasury's current credit limit of $2.8 trillion.
   The interim debt bill, which would expire Oct. 31, was approved
earlier in the week by the House. The bill is needed because a
permanent debt ceiling increase to more than $3 trillion has bogged
down in the Senate, and without more borrowing authority the
government would default on its obligations this month.
   The permanent debt bill is expected to become a legislative
vehicle for a variety of amendments in the Senate after Congress
returns next month for its fall meeting.
   Earlier Friday, the House ignored threats of a possible veto and
passed a $286.5 billion military spending bill that would slash
billions of dollars from Bush's strategic weapons programs.
   The bill, approved 312-105, would cut $1.8 billion from Star
Wars, strictly curtail production of the B-2 bomber and eliminate
all funds for the Midgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tactical
fighter and cruise missile.
   Also Friday:
   _The Senate approved an $18.4 billion spending bill for fiscal
1989 operations of the Treasury, Postal Service, and other
government agencies.
   The bill was approved only after a controversial amendment to
restore Oliver North's military pension was put off until the fall,
when it will be taken up as a separate bill.
   Among the items in the spending bill is $200,000 to remodel the
Vice President Dan Quayle's official residence, to better
accommodate his young family.
   The measure contains $5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue
Service, $300 million more than this year, and $1.3 billion for the
Customs Service, $100 million above 1989 spending.
   It also aims to prevent credit card companies from joining with
charities to seek business, and thus taking advantage of subsidized
mail rates.
   Another part of the bill would suspend for one year enforcement
of a tax law designed to encourage companies to give health
insurance to low-level workers. Business groups have complained
that the requirement is expensive and time-consuming.
   _The House ethics committee announced it will conduct
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.;
Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif.
   Lukens was convicted in Ohio on a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the unruliness of a child for having sex with a
teen-age girl.
   Two former aides to Bates have filed a complaint alleging he
sexually harassed female members of his staff.
   Three Democrats filed a complaint against Savage after news
reports said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the congressman
fondled her while he was traveling in Zaire.
   _Sen. David Durenberger, D-Minn., said the Senate ethics
committee has decided to proceed with its investigation of his book
contract that an opponent claimed was used to circumvent limits on
outside income.
   _The Senate, in a bill reacting to the Exxon Valdez disaster,
voted 99-0 to increase industry's financial liability for oil
spills, create a nationwide system to clean up such accidents and
establish a $1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages.
   _The House and Senate approved and sent to Bush a bill providing
$895 million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the
drought and other weather-related problems.

   Actor Rob Lowe passed out after videotaping two
young women having sex in his hotel room, and the women took the
tape and began circulating copies of it the next day, Rolling Stone
magazine reports.
   Lowe last week agreed to perform 20 hours of community service
to avoid prosecution for allegedly seducing then 16-year-old Jan
Parsons. Her mother drew attention to the video of Miss Parsons and
the girl's friend, Tara Seburt, when she filed suit in May against
Lowe. The civil suit is pending.
   The movie star and Miss Parsons met at a downtown disco during
the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
   Rolling Stone, in its Aug. 24 edition, quoted the dance club's
publicity director, Susan Sullivan, as saying Miss Seburt called
her the morning after the tape was made to tell her about it. Ms.
Sullivan said Miss Seburt told her that when Lowe passed out, she
and Miss Parsons left the hotel room, taking $200 from his wallet,
along with pills and the tape.
   The young women arranged through a friend at a hair salon where
they worked to have someone make copies, the magazine said.
   Lowe, who is filming a movie called ``Bad Influence,'' declined
to be interviewed for the article, and his publicists refused to
comment.
   Rolling Stone said the videotape consists of three segments,
starting with a sex escapade involving Lowe and a male and a female
friend in Paris before he went to the convention. The second
segment shows Lowe's visit to an Atlanta Braves baseball game with
California Assemblyman Tom Hayden and the third shows the encounter
with the two young women, which took place at a hotel on July 18,
1988.

   The Rolling Stones will bring their
``Steel Wheels'' tour to Syracuse's Carrier Dome for one appearance
to make up for the canceled tour opener in Buffalo, stadium
officials said.
   Syracuse University officials said they expected to sign a
formal contract by Monday for the Sept. 22 concert.
   The canceled Buffalo appearance upset New York rock fans, who
heard the show was called off because of poor attendance at a
concert by The Who at Buffalo's Rich Stadium on July 18. That show
drew slightly more than 30,000 spectators in a stadium seating
89,000 people.
   The Stones' tour, which starts Sept. 1 in Philadelphia, will
take them to Toronto; Pittsburgh; East Troy, Wis.; Cincinnati;
Raleigh, N.C.; St. Louis; Syracuse; Washington, D.C., and Cleveland.

   Musicians who quit Lionel Hampton's band because
of inadequate pay are demanding that he rehire them, and a
musicians union tried to picket the band leader's rehearsal space.
   Twelve of Hampton's 16 musicians refused to board an airplane
for Japan on July 25, saying they wanted more money per performance
than Hampton was offering.
   Hampton hired Japanese musicians while he was in the Far East
and hired Americans when he returned last week, said publicist
Chuck Jones.
   Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater New York sent a
telegram to Hampton on Thursday saying his striking members were
ready to come back to work pending negotiations, said union
President John Glasel.
   No answer came back, Glasel said. The union tried to picket
Hampton on Friday but he did not show up at his rehearsal.
   ``Here's a union that got them to strike and now wants to get
their jobs back,'' said Jones. ``He's willing to take them back,
but Lionel's got a new band.''
   Jones said the striking musicians would be the first hired
should the new band members quit, adding that two of the 12
striking members had rejoined the band.

   Actor Tom Selleck, who plays an
American marksman in an upcoming movie about frontier Australia,
won't need a stuntman to hit his marks.
   Selleck proved to be a dead-eye with a black-powder buffalo gun
last week when he visited Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Co., which is
making three of the guns for the movie.
   He fired about 50 rounds from a 13-pound, single-shot rifle with
a 34-inch barrel, similar to the guns that will be used in
``Quigley Down Under,'' and his first shot hit the 24-inch target
at 425 yards.
   Selleck will play Matthew Quigley, an American rifleman brought
to Australia in the 1800s, supposedly to shoot wild dogs called
dingos. Instead, a landowner wants him to kill aborigines, but
Quigley rebels against the order. The movie will be filmed in
Australia.

   About 3,000 people feted the Queen Mother
Elizabeth on her 89th birthday, and the National Gallery unveiled a
rather dour portrait of her.
   The unconventional portrait showed the Queen Mother without her
customary hat and wearing a simple dress.
   Alison Watt, the 23-year-old Glasgow artist who painted it, said
she didn't want the portrait to look particularly royal.
   ``She always appears fluffy, light, wearing flowing clothes and
I wanted to make her more solid. She has a lot of character,'' Ms.
Watt said Thursday. ``I didn't want her to come across as a wee
waif.''
   A spokesman at Clarence House, where the Queen Mother lives,
would say only that she had seen the portrait. ``We do not issue
statements on silly little things like this,'' he said.
   The Queen Mother, widow of King George VI and one of the most
popular royals, spent about 25 minutes Friday accepting flowers
from children while the Irish Guards played ``Happy Birthday'' and
the crowd joined in.

   A group of adoptees, birth mothers and
adoptive parents say their rally at the Lincoln Memorial is part of
an effort to seek the unsealing of confidential birth records.
   The 40 participants concluded a 2{-week march from New York to
Washington on Friday and launched a two-day public awareness
campaign that will include the rally today at the Lincoln Memorial.
   The group picketed Friday in front of the city's Office of Vital
Records while five members went inside to request original birth
certificates.
   The five, including two adoptees and three women who had given
up children they bore in the District of Columbia when they were
teen-agers, were turned down by Registrar Jack Crandall.
   ``I have the old nothing answer, I guess, because it's the
law,'' Crandall, an adoptive father himself, told the group. ``The
law says that when a person is adopted ... we create a new birth
certificate and the old certificate is under seal and can only be
opened by order of the court.''
   Similar efforts to obtain birth records had failed in New York,
Philadelphia and Baltimore earlier in the march.
   The president of another adoption group objected to the
marchers' efforts to have records unsealed.
   ``People have a right to be left alone,'' said William Pierce,
president of the National Committee for Adoption, which represents
141 adoption agencies and 2,000 individuals. ``The courts have said
rather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater than
the right to the information.''
   He pointed out that many birth mothers don't want to be found,
but Adoption Congress president Kate Burke insisted adoptees would
not abuse an open record system by disrupting the lives of birth
mothers.
   ``If a birth mother doesn't want to be found, all she has to say
is, `I don't want a relationship''' when her child contacts her,
said Burke.
   Pierce said he favors a mutual consent arrangement, in effect in
22 states, which allows birth mothers and their adult children to
meet if both register to express that desire. He called mutual
consent ``a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to get
together if they both want to.''
   ``If most of them do have a burning desire to meet, then most of
them will voluntarily register,'' Pierce said.
   Ten states use a system that allows an adult adoptee to request
a search for his or her mother and then meet her if she consents,
said Pierce. Three states _ Alaska, Alabama and Kansas _ open
records once an adoptee reaches age 18. The remainder of the states
have sealed records.

   Zipping back and forth in front of the
Capitol, the knee-high vehicle looked like a space age toy.
   But senators who celebrated the completion of the no-fuel,
cross-country journey of the prototype solar-powered vehicle are
taking James Worden's creation seriously.
   ``This really is the wave of the future,'' said Sen. John F.
Kerry, D-Mass., calling it ``one of the most exciting things we
could witness.''
   With bemused tourists looking on, three-wheeled vehicle was
inspected on the Capitol lawn Friday by lawmakers who hope
solar-driven cars can eventually replace gas-burning autos.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., pondering the possibilities of
pollution-free solar cars, said traditional automobiles produce
their weight in carbon each year, emissions that add to air
pollution and global warming.
   The 3,200-mile trip from Los Angeles to Washington via the South
was made in two weeks, setting a new world distance record for
solar cars.
   Worden, 22, the car's chief designer and one of four drivers,
said his group is working on two solar powered cars _ an economy
model that would sell for about $12,000 and a sports model for
$20,000. They would look much more like traditional autos, he said.
   Worden hopes to have the cars in ``semi-mass production'' within
two years.
   ``Our message is ... everyone can drive to work and back in a
solar car,'' said Worden, a 1989 graduate of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who built his first solar-powered car while
in high school.
   The 270-pound ``Solectria'' has a single-seat cockpit styled
like the inside of a racing car, with the driver's legs extending
straight forward and a tiny steering wheel. An 11-foot by 6{-foot
rectangular solar panel sits flat atop the body, with a small
bubble in the middle for the driver.
   ``It's actually comfortable,'' said the 6-foot 4-inch Kerry,
looking decidedly uncomfortable as he sat in the car.
   The vehicle is powered by a small electric motor that can get
the car up to 90 mph.
   Worden's prototype clearly has limitations _ he could not get
the vehicle to get over a curb to get to the site of the news
conference _ but it has responsive turning and fast pick up. The
designer raced around the Capitol parking lot at speeds that
ordinarily would bring a warning from security guards.
   Worden, wearing a white racing jumpsuit and flashing a thumbs up
sign, said the team had few troubles other than a couple of flats
in Louisiana. But the traditional gas-powered truck that brought
the solar car from Massachusetts to California broke down.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Congress Would Be Wrong in Taking Driver's Licenses from
Dropouts</HEAD>

   Congress would be making a mistake by
following West Virginia's lead and barring high school dropouts
from driving, said the lawyer for the teen-ager who failed in his
challenge of the state law.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib upheld the law Friday,
saying the government has a compelling interest in keeping children
in class.
   The case involved an appeal filed by 17-year-old Michael Means,
who lost his license when he dropped out shortly after his 16th
birthday.
   The law has drawn national attention, and on Thursday an
Illinois congressman introduced a bill for a similar nationwide
statute.
   Means' lawyer, Christopher Butch, said that would be a mistake.
   Butch said inner-city youths often don't have access to cars and
won't care if their driver's licenses are taken away.
   ``White, suburban kids will go back to school so they can have
the car on Saturday night and go cruising,'' he said. ``Kids in the
inner-city are going to have no reason to stay in school because
they can use the Lexington Avenue subway.''
   Means, whose 16-year-old wife is expecting their first child
this month, lives on the outskirts of Charleston and says he can't
get a job to support his family without driving privileges. He
overslept, Butch said, and did not attend Friday's hearing.
   Means does not have a home telephone and messages left with his
family weren't returned.
   In his ruling, Zakaib said Means was not denied due process
because he was granted a hearing by the state Department of Motor
Vehicles before his license was suspended.
   He also ruled that Means failed to prove he was forced to drop
out of school by circumstances beyond his control, an exemption
provided by the state law.
   Noting that 40 percent of the state's residents have an
eighth-grade education or less, Zakaib said the law is a legitimate
way for the state to persuade students to stay in school.
   ``The failure to graduate or complete a secondary education not
only adversely affects the juvenile, it affects the society as a
whole,'' Zakaib said.
   Assistant Attorney General Bruce Walker, who represented the
state at Friday's hearing, said 400 dropouts whose licenses were
suspended because of the new law returned to school last year.
   The state normally has 5,000 dropouts each school year, but in
1988-89 the number was just 3,400 to 3,500, Walker said.
   ``This ruling establishes that driving is a conditional
privilege and not a basic right,'' said Attorney General Charlie
Brown. ``Further, this law acts as a positive tool in building a
solid foundation for a prosperous and more educated generation.''

<HEAD>Report: Statehood for Puerto Rico Could Raise Social Welfare Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Puerto Rico becomes a state, federal
spending for some social welfare programs could rise, a
congressional study says.
   The study, released Friday by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
who requested it, looked at the effects of a proposal for a
referendum on the status of Puerto Rico, currently before Congress.
   The Congressional Research Report analyzed what would happen to
some social welfare programs if Puerto Rico were to become a state;
be granted independence; or receive ``enhanced'' commonwealth
status under which federal grant-in-aid programs could be
consolidated and streamlined.
   For example, replacing Puerto Rico's program of aid to the aged,
blind or disabled with the Supplemental Security Income program
would significantly expand the eligible population, increasing
benefits by as much as tenfold, said the report.
   The study didn't make definitive cost or budget estimates but
looked at the general implications of the alternatives.
   Demographically, Puerto Rico is younger, poorer and suffers
higher unemployment than any of the 50 states, the study noted.
   The programs that would have the greatest impact if extended to
Puerto Rico as a state are food stamps, Supplemental Security
Income and the earned income tax credit, for which benefits are
nationally uniform and not set by the states, the study found.
   Currently, SSI is not available in Puerto Rico. The program,
which is administered by the Social Security Administration,
guarantees a minimum level of cash income to the needy blind, aged
and disabled. Instead, Puerto Rico operates an assistance program
of aid to such people, although disability payments are restricted
to those age 18 or older.
   The U.S. government pays 75 percent of Puerto Rico's assistance
payments to the aged, blind or disabled up to a specified limit,
the report says. In fiscal 1987, Puerto Rico qualified for a
maximum of $12.9 million in matching funds, according to the study.
   But if Puerto Rico were treated like the states, SSI would
replace the current system, providing much larger benefits but
setting much higher eligibility limits, the report says.
Furthermore, SSI would cover disabled children not currently
included.
   If Puerto Rico became a state, the federal food stamp program
would replace its Nutrition Assistance Program, under which
eligible people receive cash benefits.
   All benefits would have to be issued in coupons, and while it is
not clear what the levels would be, they would be higher than in
the rest of the country, according to the report.

<HEAD>Administration Supports Farm Disaster Assistance Package</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is embracing a nearly
$900 million package of federal disaster aid for farmers passed by
Congress to cover crop losses this year from severe weather.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter indicated Friday the
president would sign the legislation and he vowed to implement the
relief program ``as promptly and fairly as we possibly can.''
   Passage of the measure by the House and Senate ended weeks of
uncertainty for farm-state lawmakers, who worried they would have
to return home empty-handed for a month-long recess. Now they can
assure farmers that federal relief checks will be available to
cover expenses for the fall planting season.
   ``When our farmers suffer catastrophic loss, whether it's due to
drought, flood or other disastrous weather, we must keep our pact
with those who work the land,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman
of the Agriculture Committee, said before the Senate approved the
measure on a voice vote and forwarded it to the White House.
   The House passed the bill earlier in the day without a recorded
vote.
   In general, farmers can qualify for federal payments if they
suffer crop losses from 35 percent to 50 percent because of
weather-related disasters. The measure also offers payments to
livestock producers facing drought-related feed and water shortages
for their herds.
   Key eligibility and payment provisions in the assistance package
are identical to legislation approved Wednesday by the Senate. The
bill is projected to cost about $895 million.
   ``It seems to me that the final outcome is about as sound as
could have been expected under the circumstances,'' said Yeutter.
   The legislation is aimed primarily at farmers in portions of the
Great Plains and western Corn Belt, which have not recovered from
the drought of 1988, and in the South, where flooding has destroyed
rice and cotton.
   The bill has different eligibility standards for various crops
but in all cases, producers would receive payments designed to
cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses.
   In most instances, the projected income levels will be based on
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have
received had they not suffered losses.
   Lawmakers intend to pay for the relief package with savings from
commodity subsidy programs, which are costing less because of
higher market prices this year from weather-shrunken harvests.
   Last year, Congress approved $3.9 billion in assistance for
farmers hurt by drought. Supporters of this year's legislation said
continued severe weather required another relief package but they
pledged to improve the federal crop insurance program to alleviate
the need for agricultural disaster aid in the future.

   Responding to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the
Senate has passed environmental-protection legislation hailed by
Majority Leader George Mitchell as reducing ``the potential for
damage to our nation.''
   The measure boosts companies' liability for oil spills, creates
a nationwide system to clean them up and establishes a $1 billion
trust fund to help compensate for damages. Similar legislation is
pending in the House.
   Such legislation had been under consideration for years, but the
issue took on a new sense of urgency after the tanker struck Bligh
Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound, rupturing the ship's hull
and spilling 11 million gallons of oil that stained the coastline.
   Added impetus came from two smaller-scale spills over a 24-hour
period off Rhode Island, in the Delaware River and in the Houston
Ship Channel.
   ``The purpose of this bill is to make sure that we never again
allow an oil spill to become an ecological disaster,'' said Sen.
Max Baucus, D-Mont., the bill's floor manager.
   ``This legislation, when enacted into law, will discourage such
oil spills in the future and reduce the potential for damage to our
nation,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine, who worked for passage of
oil-spill legislation for eight years.
   ``And if they do occur, they will be cleaned up and compensated
much more readily than has been the case,'' he said.
   The bill was approved 99-0, with Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., not voting.
   The legislation directs that contingency plans be drawn for
dealing with oil spills on land and water and requires the
establishment of cleanup teams with pre-placed equipment.
   The $1 billion trust fund will be financed by a 3-cent-a-barrel
fee _ or tax _ on all domestic and imported petroleum.
   The bill provides for increasing the limit of compensation for
each oil spill from $500 million to $1 billion.
   In Alaska, Gov. Steve Cowper praised the action.
   ``This bill is a major step forward for Alaska and all other
coastal states whose residents face enormous economic,
environmental and human damage from oil spills,'' Cowper said in
Fairbanks. ``This bill won't end the suffering, but it will make
major spills less likely and the response to them quicker and
better.''
   In acting on a series of amendments, the Senate sharply raised
an owner's liability for compensating for oil spills and their
destruction of property and the environment.
   The legislation preserves the authority of the states to impose
unlimited liability if they wish and to impose their own oil spill
standards and requirements, set up cleanup or compensation funds
and levy fees and penalties.
   It also gives the president extensive authority to take overall
charge of cleanup efforts, including issuing orders to owners.

   Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu and two veteran
politicians from the ruling party today applied to run in next
week's election to choose the third prime minister in Japan this
year.
   Scandals involving bribery and sex have forced Noboru Takeshita
and his successor, Sousuke Uno, from office prematurely.
   While the 58-year-old Kaifu remains the front-runner, some party
leaders complained that he had been selected in backroom factional
manuevers. Offended by those wanting reform pledges, two party
veterans announced at the last minute Friday that they would
challenge Kaifu.
   All three put in nomination papers shortly before the deadline
this morning at the headquarters of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, which holds a secret ballot Tuesday to elect a
successor to Prime Minister Uno.
   Uno took office June 2, replacing Takeshita, who resigned as an
influence-peddling scandal sent the party's popularity skidding to
record lows in opinion polls. Uno became the target of allegations
he kept paid mistresses, and he decided to step down after the
party lost in July voting for half the seats in the upper house of
Parliament.
   The other candidates are Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, a former welfare
minister, and ex-Transportation Minister Shintaro Ishihara, 56, who
comes from the strongly nationalist wing of the party.
   Whoever is elected to head the party is assured the prime
ministership because of its majority in the House of
Representatives in the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   Kaifu, known as an eloquent speaker, pledged to promote
political reforms to restore public trust in the scandal-plagued
party. In a statement formally announcing his candidacy today, he
also stressed the continuation of Japan's close ties with the
United States and development aid to third world countries.
   ``In order to protect the peace of our nation and the world, I
will maintain the Japan-U.S. security system and continue our
efforts to defend our own country by our own hands,'' Kaifu said.
   Though his career as a 10-term member of the House of
Representatives qualifies him as a contender for prime minister in
the eyes of many party members, he has not served in top Cabinet or
party posts, and his faction in the party is one of the smallest,
giving him little political power.
   On Friday, the large faction led by former Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa decided to support Hayashi, who also belongs to one
of the smallest groups in the party.
   Seiichi Ohta, a leading member of the Miyazawa faction, called
for an open selection process for the next leader and criticized
Kaifu's candidacy as a product of factional maneuvering.
   The ruling party is a collection of a half-dozen major factions
that are differentiated more by personal and financial allegiances
than by policy or ideology.
   Ishihara, a prominent author known for his conservative, often
nationalist views, is supported by some young members of the party
across factional lines.
   He said Friday, ``Politics do not exist for politicians, but for
the country. If we leave the situation as it is now, factionalism
and power politics will continue to prevail.''
   Analysts said Kaifu remained the leading candidate because of
strong backing from factions led by Takeshita and former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe, two of the most powerful members of the
party.
   The party's 405 lawmakers and 47 representatives from local
chapters will vote in a secret ballot Tuesday to chose its new
president. The party plans to have the winner elected as the new
prime minister in Parliament Wednesday. A new cabinet is expected
to be announced by late Wednesday.
   The Liberal Democrats have been seeking a strong leader who can
restore public trust in the scandal-ridden party.
   The party's popular No. 2 official, Ryutaro Hashimoto, 52, had
been regarded as a potential contender, but he formally declined to
run Friday, saying his candidacy would have created a further split
in the party.
   Party officials said the new leader will serve only until the
end of October when Takeshita's original term expires. The party
then will hold a new election, they said.

   Piedmont Airlines has suspended two mechanics
who are suspected of having accidentally left wheel chocks in both
wing wheel wells of a jet that was forced to make an emergency
landing in North Carolina.
   The mechanics, whose names were not released, were suspended
without pay pending an investigation by the airline of the
incident, said David H. Shipley, spokesman for USAir Group,
headquartered in Washington.
   He estimated the airline's investigation would take four days
and said, ``Until that time, the full disciplinary actions will not
be determined.''
   USAir Group owns Piedmont and was scheduled to merge the carrier
into USAir today.
   The Boeing 737, with 100 people aboard left National Airport
bound for Columbia, S.C., on Wednesday with a stop in Charlotte. It
was diverted to Greensboro when the crew couldn't get the landing
gear down. No one was injured in the emergency landing.
   Triangular rubber blocks about called wheel chocks, about 2{
feet on a side, are used to keep the plane from rolling while it is
on the ground.
   Phillip Powell, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said Thursday a 2{-foot wheel chock had been found in
the left wheel well immediately after the landing and investigators
found evidence _ bent hydraulic lines _ that a chock in the right
well was thrown out during maneuvers to shake the gear loose.
   The two mechanics were assigned to check the plane Tuesday
night, and during that check, said Jay Golden, director of the
safety board's regional office in Atlanta, the aircraft was moved
six times. The chocks were apparently placed in the wells during
one of those moves, he said.
   Ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks in the wheel well while
moving planes, Powell said, a practice he called ``not a normal
procedure.''
   Powell said routine preflight inspection should have included
checking the wheel compartments.
   Pilot Larry Fuda told investigators he delegated the walk-around
inspection to First Officer David Curtis before takeoff.
   Fuda landed the jet on its right main gear, then touched the
nose wheel down before settling the plane onto its left engine and
skidding to a halt on the 10,000-foot runway, a shower of sparks
coming from the scraping metal. Only the left engine, suspended
below the wing, was damaged and the plane is expected to be
returned to service after repairs.

<HEAD>Bush Voices Support for Nicaraguan Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush met with leaders of the
Nicaraguan Contras to reinforce his support for their cause on the
eve of today's meeting of Central American presidents to discuss
disbanding the rebel force.
   Contra commander Enrique Bermudez, Contra directorate member
Aristides Sanchez and other leaders told Bush at the 20-minute
meeting Friday that any demobilization must be tied to democratic
reforms by Nicaragua's leftist government.
   ``They said if worse comes to worse, they're prepared to
continue their struggle,'' said one administration official with
knowledge of the meeting.
   Bush said ``he had supported them in the past and would continue
to do so in the future,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   According to Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros, Bush told the
rebels he was urging the Central American presidents ``to preserve
the integrity of the resistance'' until the Nicaraguan elections in
February.
   Matamoros said that could mean the forces will remain encamped
in Honduras or move into Nicaragua under conditions negotiated with
the Sandinistas.
   The White House meeting came as Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega announced the domestic political opposition had agreed the
Contras should disband. Ortega said he will insist at the
presidents' summit that camps housing 12,000 Contras in southern
Honduras be emptied.
   Matamoros said the rebels support the principles laid out in the
Ortega agreement announced in Managua, but only if democratic
reforms come first.
   The Central American presidents meet this weekend to work on
specifics of their earlier agreement that the rebel army should be
disbanded in return for reform in Nicaragua. The Bush
administration wants clear signs of democratic change before the
Contras have to disband.
   U.S. officials have sidestepped the question of whether that
means they want to keep the Contras together as a fighting force
until the elections.
   ``You can argue over timing, but the answer is ... we feel that
we should not be disintegrating the Contras until there's some
assurance that the Sandinistas are meeting their democratic
commitments,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater on
Friday.
   Despite Bush's vote of confidence, Matamoros said the rebels
were upset with efforts from ``certain sectors in the State
Department'' to divide the Contras, to speed demobilization.
   On Capitol Hill this week, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
accused Bush of breaking an agreement with Congress by urging the
Central American presidents not to disband the Contras until after
Nicaragua's Feb. 25 elections are concluded.
   He warned Congress could off the $40 million aid package agreed
to in a bipartisan accord between Bush and congressional Democrats.
   The aid package is to keep the Contras supplied with non-lethal
materials, but also can be used for voluntary relocation of rebels
into Nicaragua.

   Like a lot of 5-year-olds, Jennifer Wang
dreams of being many things when she grows up. Like a lot of
parents, her father is already worried about paying for her
education.
   ``She wants to be a fireman, she wants to be a nurse, she wants
to be a doctor,'' said Ho Wang.
   With the introduction of the first national prepaid tuition
program, Wang and other parents would have the option of paying now
for their childrens' education _ a hedge against the rising costs
of college.
   Under the National Prepaid Tuition Plan, Jennifer could be
signed up for four years at a college before she can even pronounce
its name.
   ``If I can have the opportunity of locking in the cost now
without having to worry about the rate of return in future years,
that would certainly be one of my considerations,'' Wang said in a
telephone interview from New York, where he works as a high-yield
bond analyst.
   Universities such as Arizona State, Wisconsin and George
Washington have expressed interest in the plan, proposed by St.
Paul-based HEMAR Education Corp., but many others doubt whether it
will ever get off the ground.
   Parents would pay a lump sum into independent investment funds
selected by colleges with the help of HEMAR, which would charge 1
percent annually from the interest on the accounts. This would
guarantee a four-year education, as long as the student was
admitted to the college.
   Wang said he wondered whether highly competitive schools with
tight admissions policies would ever partake in the plan.
   HEMAR President P. Gregory Stringer said he hoped the plan would
be available this fall or winter pending rulings from the Internal
Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Stringer, a former bank official and assistant director of
financial aid at Yale University, said he envisions at least half
of the nation's colleges, including top schools, signing up within
five years.
   His company, which is affiliated with the Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a student loan insurer, mailed announcements
about the plan last month to 1,350 schools.
   ``It gives them a recruiting device they didn't have before. Now
they're in a position to recruit students at the age of birth if
they're particularly aggressive,'' said Stringer.
   Stringer said the plan was flexible in allowing students to
select schools other than the ones invested in by their parents.
Such investments could be transferred in some cases, although
parents would receive only their original investment back _ without
interest _ if their children decided not to go to college, or
selected schools not included in the plan.
   ``We worked pretty hard to make sure this plan had value to
colleges as well as consumers,'' Stringer said.
   The National Tuition Maintenance Organization in Ann Arbor,
Mich., is introducing its own prepaid tuition plan, set up as a
taxable mutual fund, to 30 colleges' alumni and supporters this
month.
   Some experts have reservations about prepaid tuition, saying it
would be extremely risky for colleges to participate in the plan.
   Arthur Hauptman, a policy consultant for the American Council on
Education in Washington, an association of about 1,400 colleges and
universities, said it could mean that taxpayers or other students
would have to pay if the invested prepayments don't keep pace with
rising tuition costs.
   Hauptman said a school that hadn't done well in investing the
prepayments might be tempted not to accept some of the children as
students, because prepayment is no guarantee of admission.
   ``I really do think this tension between the admission office
and the business office could become very problematic, where the
economies of the plan may dictate who gets admitted to school,''
Hauptman said.
   State-sponsored prepaid tuition programs exist already in
Michigan, Florida and Wyoming.
   Duquesne University in Pittsburgh pioneered a plan four years
ago allowing alumni parents to pay a lump sum guaranteeing four
years of college assuming the child was accepted for admission.
   But Duquesne suspended the plan last year because of
higher-than-expected tuition increases and lower-than-anticipated
earnings on investments that rendered it uneconomical.

   Federal courts get bogged down interpreting
unclear laws, and the Supreme Court is moving toward returning to a
method of interpretation that would force Congress to legislate
more carefully, Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White said.
   ``It is a truism to say that over the years Congress has come to
be the primary source of change in federal law ... the upshot has
been that much more of the work of the federal courts has involved
the interpretation and application of statutory law,'' White said
in a speech Friday night before the American Bar Association
convention.
   In the past 50 years, White said, courts have determined
congressional intent of a law based not only on the statute itself,
but on it's ``legislative history,'' including committee hearings
and reports, debates on the floor and conference committee actions.
   The courts follow the statutory language if it clearly relects
legislative intent, he said, but many cases involve ``ambiguous
language, and in these cases resort to legislative history has been
the usual course,'' White said.
   ``This is often a very large undertaking, taking hours and hours
of effort by judges, law clerks, and librarians, to say nothing of
the time lawyers spend and charge for seeking to present the
materials that the judiciary has indicated are relevant to
decision.''
   With the increasing complexity of subject matter, Justice
Antonin Scalia is advocating a return to interpreting statutes
based mainly on the legislation's text, White said.
   The debate over how statutes should be interpreted ``is
extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry
out the will of Congress,'' he said.
   Sometimes, White said, Congress is vague on purpose, to force
court decisions.

   Congress sent a landmark savings and loan
bailout to President Bush early today after a frantic two days of
wrangling over the finishing touches on the biggest financial
rescue in history.
   The House passed the $159 billion legislation shortly after
midnight Friday on a 201-175 vote, allowing weary members of
Congress to begin a monthlong vacation that had been threatened by
a bitter fight with the administration over the financing of the
package.
   House Democrats abandoned the bill in large numbers after key
congressional negotiators bowed to a veto threat by Bush and agreed
to hide 60 percent of the bailout's cost from the federal deficit.
   But with the losses of government-insured deposits mounting at a
rate of $20 million to $30 million daily, House and Senate leaders
from both parties _ with vigorous personal lobbying by Bush over
the telephone _ put together enough votes to replenish an insolvent
S&amp;L insurance fund with $50 billion.
   ``The savings of million of Americans are at stake unless we do
something,'' Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said just before the
Senate approved the bill on a non-roll call late Thursday night.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, said the nation risked ``another
bank holiday'' similar to the wave of bank closings of 1933 when
depositors lined up for blocks demanding their savings, turning
what was then a recession into the Great Depression.
   The $50 billion will be used over the next three years to close
and merge 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors whose savings
were lost to failed and often fraudulent loans over the past
decade, most of them in Texas.
   The legislation also overhauls the regulation of the industry,
requiring owners of the nation's 3,000 thrift institutions to put
up billions of dollars more of their own money as capital to serve
as a buffer between risky loans and federal deposit insurance funds.
   Congress and the administration had worked out the reforms weeks
ago, leaving the sticky issue of how to pay for the bailout without
raising taxes or dipping into other government programs as the
major roadblock to fixing the S&amp;L crisis.
   Bush insisted that the money be raised through an elaborate
scheme using non-Treasury bonds to be issued by a new government
agency created only for that purpose as a way of keeping the
bailout costs out of the government's official deficit figures.
   Democrats demanded that the money be borrowed directly through
the Treasury, a move that would have swelled the deficit by $44
billion over three years but would have reduced the 30-year
interest costs on the borrowing by $4.5 billion.
   After Bush on Thursday threatened to veto the bill if it
ballooned the deficit, the two sides agreed to split the financing
both ways.
   Under an accord hammered out by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman with key
lawmakers, the Treasury will borrow $20 billion before October,
swelling the estimated deficit for this year from $148 billion to
$168 billion.
   But the non-Treasury bonds will be used to raise the other $30
billion in 1990 and 1991, raising the deficit a maximum of only
$3.5 billion _ the annual interest payments on the borrowing _ each
of those years if current interest rates prevail.
   Just before the vote today, Rep. Sam Gibbons of Florida, one of
135 House Democrats voting against the bill, complained his
colleagues had lost their conscience and their backbone in response
to Bush's veto threat.
   ``It should have been paid for by taxes, but the president could
not bring himself to say the word,'' said Gibbons. ``So we have
fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and
grandchildren.''
   By the administration's latest estimates, the bailout is
expected to cost $159 billion _ including interest on the borrowing
to pay for it _ over the next 10 years.
   Over 30 years, the costs mushroom to $285 billion, of which
taxpayers will pay at least $157 billion, according to the
congressional auditors in the General Accounting Office.
   The bill also requires S&amp;Ls to channel more of their lending to
home mortgages and away from speculative commercial real estate
ventures and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   It gives the Justice Department $75 million a year to root out
fraud at financial institutions and establishes a new agency, the
Resolution Trust Corp., to dispose of $300 billion of real estate
and other property falling into the government's hands through
failed S&amp;L loans.
   For the first time, banks will be able to buy and own healthy
S&amp;Ls, their biggest lending market competitor in many communities.
And the thrift industry will be required to pour $50 million to
$100 million of its profits each year into subsidizing mortgages at
below-market interest rates for low-income families.

   The source of future paychecks is uncertain, but
musicians of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra believe the show must
go on.
   ``You've got to think optimistically,'' trumpet player Bill
Lucas said. ``Not being paid is a big thing. But it takes a lot to
get here, and it wouldn't be the first time I didn't get paid.''
   The orchestra, regarded as one of the nation's top 10, is
verging on collapse with an $8 million deficit. If not for a recent
$1 million state appropriation, the symphony already would have
closed.
   Without $18 million in donations, bankruptcy court is the next
step for the 75-year-old orchestra, Chairman Robert S. Miller Jr.
said.
   As an executive vice president at Chrysler Corp., Miller helped
guide the No. 3 automaker out of a financial abyss a decade ago and
hopes to reprise that success with the symphony, which he took over
last year.
   The musicians believe Detroit needs a symphony to help offset a
national reputation of being ridden with drugs and crime.
   ``A good orchestra would provide better public relations for
Detroit than any car this city could produce,'' said Hart Hollman,
a viola player in the orchestra since 1973. ``If a city has any
intellectual activity, it has to have a symphony.
   ``If you don't have appreciation for arts, then you don't have
much.''
   That appreciation has been lacking, and symphony management
concedes it hasn't been nurtured.
   ``The graying of American audiences is one of the crucial
problems that all orchestras face,'' orchestra Executive Director
Deborah Borda said. ``If you go to one of our concerts, you see the
average age of the audience is in the late 50s and early 60s.''
   Attendance has lagged at a little more than 50 percent, for the
orchestra has failed not only to draw younger concertgoers, but
also minority patrons. The city's population, some 1 million, is
about two-thirds black.
   ``The orchestra had not listened seriously to a number of
concerns that were raised by the community about it being a part of
the community,'' Borda said. ``You can't live in a community and be
totally divorced from it.''
   The symphony has hired a black bass player, Richard Robinson,
but without going through the normal blind audition procedure, in
which those choosing among the finalists for a position can't see
the candidates.
   That drew criticism from many musicians who, while praising
Robinson's ability, think his hiring without an audition could
compromise the symphony's artistic reputation and keep qualified
musicians from trying out.
   Borda said the orchestra's decision to hire Robinson ``has had a
profound effect in the symphony industry. It has made people
question themselves about what does the symphony orchestra need to
do to be more inclusive, while not lowering their standards.''
   As for the financial problems, the musicians blame previous
management.
   Fund-raising also was hurt when Music Director Gunther Herbig
announced he would move to the Toronto Symphony after next season.
   The Detroit Symphony is one of several U.S. symphonies to run at
a deficit.
   The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, considered among the most
financially secure, reported a $1.5 million loss last season, its
largest ever. Orchestras in New Orleans and Nashville recently
resumed operations after closing temporarily because of money woes.
   And the financially plagued Denver Symphony Orchestra started to
make plans for this season thanks to a survival plan approved
Friday that includes shortening the season by half and cutting
musicians' salaries.
   Miller and Borda have a five-year plan to eliminate the Detroit
orchestra's debt by 1993. The plan seeks to control costs, attract
urban professionals and blacks, increase the orchestra's endowment
and name a replacement for Herbig by March.
   The orchestra also is moving from Ford Auditorium downtown to
the acoustically superior Orchestra Hall.
   The new programs already have shown signs of success.
Subscriptions are running 20 percent ahead of those during the past
five years, Borda said.
   ``There has been so much bad news about the symphony for so long
that that general atmosphere makes it tougher to raise money,''
Borda said.

   President Bush says he is forming a
seven-member commission to investigate air terrorism, with
particular emphasis on the bombing last December of Pan Am Flight
103.
   Bush, in an executive order, said Friday the Commission on
Aviation Security and Terrorism would study the adequacy of
security procedures.
   ``The commission also shall review options for handling
terrorist acts involving aviation,'' Bush's order said.
   The panel also will study the issue of public notification of
bomb threats, the order said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that ``ongoing, intensive investigations into all aspects
of the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 will not be affected by the
commission's work. Rather, the commission will focus on the need
for additional measures to improve aviation security.''

<HEAD>EPA Bans Ant Killer as Danger to Children</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency is banning
household ant killers containing the chemical sodium arsenate
because of the danger of children ingesting the compounds.
   The EPA said the chemical is used to kill ants that are merely a
nuisance and do not threaten human health, food crops or wood
structures.
   EPA spokesman Ed Heier said Friday the product is a sugary
liquid made by several companies and sold under numerous brand
names. He said that because the purchaser normally applies the ant
killer and leaves it exposed, it is not child-proof.
   Most often, the EPA said, the compound is applied to cardboard,
wax paper, bottle caps or food to attract ants.

   The United States has agreed to provide Haiti
with $10 million in food aid, the first such assistance since the
failed elections of November 1987, it was announced.
   Under terms of an agreement signed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti will
receive about 45,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, which it will sell
on the local market. Proceeds will be used for development projects.
   In making the announcement Friday, which was first reported
Thursday on Haitian television, the Agency for International
Development said Congress approved the new aid in recognition of
continuing progress by the interim government of Gen. Prosper Avril
toward free elections.
   The decision also was based on Haiti's cooperation with the
United States in narcotics interdiction efforts, AID said.
   The Haitian government cancelled the November 1987 national
elections after an outburst of violence on the morning of the
balloting claimed at least 50 dead and dozens wounded.
   The Reagan administration suspended $62 million in economic aid
hours after Haiti disbanded the national electoral council.

<HEAD>USDA Announces $9.5 Million in Payments to Apple Growers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has announced
details of $9.5 million in payments to apple growers under a
program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the
chemical Alar.
   Under the plan, 57.5 million pounds of fresh apples will be
diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations
requesting them, including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock
feed, the department said Friday.
   The plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade
channels and thus, without disrupting the market, reduce a huge
surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an
environmental group charged that Alar posed an unacceptably high
risk of cancer.
   Governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the
Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps to ban the use of
Alar, which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color, extend
storage life and make harvesting easier.
   The payments were awarded to bidders under a $15 million overall
program to aid the industry that was announced July 25 by the
department. it said growers participating are located in
Connecticut, New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.

   The five miners who prospector-cannibal
Alferd G. Packer fed upon in the winter of 1874 were viciously
beaten to death and their bones picked clean of flesh with knives,
researchers say
   ``The pangs of starvation cannot adequately and totally account
for the brutality manifested in these killings,'' said James
Starrs, a professor of law and forensic science at George
Washington University.
   ``What we have seen is not merely murder but butchery, a
butchery at once wholesale, remorseless, unremitting and
deliberate,'' he said at a news conference Friday.
   Starrs organized a scientific inquiry that last month unearthed
the bones of the five men in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern
Colorado.
   The expedition was launched to solve one of the grisly mysteries
of the Old West, the story of Packer _ a harness maker, guide and
prospector from Utah _ and the men he ate.
   A team of 13 scientists and anthropologists using radar-mapping
equipment recovered the remains two miles south of Lake City, Colo.
   Packer and five other gold-seekers became snowbound on a
9,000-foot-high pass in February 1874. Packer walked out of the
mountains the following April.
   In his confession, he admitted having eaten the others to
survive, but said he had shot one of the men, Shannon Wilson Bell,
in self-defense when he returned to camp and found Bell had
murdered the other four with a hatchet.
   ``There is no visible evidence for gunshot wounds on any of
them,'' said Walter Birkby, director of the Human Identification
Laboratory at the University of Arizona and curator of physical
anthropology at the Arizona State Museum.
   Birkby, a forensic anthropologist, initially had said last month
there appeared to be a bullet hole in one pelvic bone. But he said
laboratory examination showed it to be a hole caused by the canine
tooth of a flesh-eating animal.
   Birkby said the youngest victim, believed to be 17 or 19, was
beaten the most severely. ``He was hit at least 11 times in the
head with an axe.''
   The young man's shattered upper left arm suggested that he had
been able for a time to fend off his attacker.
   The victim would have been in better shape, stronger and perhaps
better able to withstand the rigors of starvation and temperature
than his older co-victims, the oldest of whom was between 50 and
60, Birkby said.
   Starrs said: ``Someone had an insatiable hunger. Whether for
human flesh or not I am not about to say. This was not mindless
cannibalism in any sense. These bodies were denuded of their flesh
in a concerted and calculated way.''
   Packer escaped from custody but was captured in 1883 in
Cheyenne, Wyo., and was convicted of murdering one prospector and
sentenced to hang. The sentence was overturned on a technicality
and on retrial he was convicted of manslaughter and given a 40-year
prison sentence.
   Packer died in April 1907, six years after he was paroled.
   Starrs said the bones will be reinterred Aug. 14 at Lake City.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A previously unknown group claimed in a
statement published today that a man killed in a London hotel
explosion was preparing an attack on British author Salman Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 14, when the
late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said his novel
``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and called on Moslems to
kill the author.
   Scotland Yard said a man was killed Thursday as he worked with a
handmade explosive charge inside a London hotel near Paddington
Station.
   The statement from a group calling itself the Organization of
Islam's Mujahedeen did not identify the man, which it said was the
group's ``first martyr.''
   ``Others would follow his example to try to kill Rushdie,'' said
the statement published in Beirut's leading newspaper, An-Nahar.
   ``Henceforth, we warn all those who supported and facilitated
Rushdie's works and helped publish the satanic book to back off
because our hand will reach out for them all,'' the group said.
   The statement called on British authorities to preserve the dead
man's body, saying it would make arrangements to recover it later.
   In London, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said police were
discounting claims that Rushdie was the intended target of the bomb.
   The dead man, the only victim of the Thursday blast at the
18-room Beverley House Hotel, had been staying there for several
days, police said.
   He was believed to have a French passport and be of Moroccan
background, according to hotel records, although his passport had
not been recovered, said a representative of Scotland Yard's press
office, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The dead man's surname
was given as Mazeh, he said, but there was no first name yet.

<HEAD>Judge Delays Immediate Possession of Artworks By Cypriots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled the Republic of Cyprus will
have to wait until at least next week to take possession of four
sixth-century mosaics as attorneys for an art dealer fought to keep
the artworks in Indiana.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland said Friday he would decide
Tuesday when the Cypriots could take possession of the mosaics,
which remain locked in an Indianapolis vault.
   The delay was in response to a motion filed by the Cypriots
seeking immediate possession of the artworks.
   Noland ruled Thursday that Peg L. Goldberg of suburban
Indianapolis must return the mosaics, which were stolen from a
Greek Orthodox church in Cyprus about 10 years ago.
   Attorneys for Ms. Goldberg, meanwhile, filed a motion Friday to
keep the mosaics in Indiana pending a possible appeal.
   Joe C. Emerson, an attorney for Ms. Goldberg, said that if the
Cypriots were allowed to take the mosaics out of the United States
there would be ``grave difficulties'' in getting the artworks back.
   Thomas R. Kline, an attorney for the Cypriots, said his clients
were determined to reclaim the mosaics ``as soon as possible.''
   A local Greek Orthodox priest had stood by Friday to bless the
mosaics.
   Michael Kyprianou, senior counsel for the Republic of Cyprus,
said an icon which belongs to a church can only be removed after a
blessing is given by a priest. ``The same procedure is followed
when you want to take it back,'' Kyprianou said.
   In Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus hailed the court
decision Friday as opening the way for the recovery of stolen
archaeological treasures worldwide.
   ``This encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted
treasures because it will discourage international art merchants
who deal in such stolen property,'' he said.
   In his 86-page ruling Thursday, Noland said Ms. Goldberg never
obtained title to the mosaics, which she bought for $1.1 million
last summer in Switzerland.
   Ms. Goldberg had the mosaics restored last year at an
Indianapolis museum.
   The mosaics, which date to 530 A.D., depict Jesus as a young
boy, the apostles James and Matthew and an archangel. They were
originally part of a larger mosaic on the ceiling of the Church of
the Panagia Kanakaria.
   The Cypriots learned the whereabouts of the mosaics in January,
when Ms. Goldberg offered them to the J. Paul Getty Museum in
Malibu, Calif., for $20 million.
   The Republic of Cyprus and the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox
Church of Cyprus sued Ms. Goldberg and her art dealership, Goldberg
and Feldman Fine Arts of Carmel, in March to recover the mosaics.
The trial began May 30 and lasted six days.

   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York told black
Roman Catholics the church needs to rid itself of racism, and
appealed to them not to be led out of the Catholic Church by false
leaders.
   ``How many phonies are there? How many people can you trust when
you put them in positions of leadership?'' the cardinal said Friday
before about 250 people attending a four-day conference of black
Catholics.
   The hottest topic of conversation at the conference is the Rev.
George Stallings, a black Washington priest who has formed a
separate church that combines Catholicism with African and black
American religious traditions.
   Of Stallings, O'Connor would say only that he is ``praying for
everybody involved'' and is leaving the priest's fate up to local
church authorities. The church has suspended him from performing
sanctioned Masses and other sacraments but has not moved to
excommunicate him.
   O'Connor implored black Catholics not to let racial questions
force them from the church.
   ``The church cannot be exclusive, whether it's exclusively
white, exclusively black, exclusively yellow,'' O'Connor said. ``We
are all one in the body of Christ.''
   The conference, whose theme is ``Creating a Spirit of
African-American Leadership,'' centers on ways to eliminate racism
in the church and bring more blacks into top church positions.
   Archbishop Eugene Marino of Atlanta, the first black archbishop
in the United States, said he was saddened at the schism
highlighted by Stallings' break, but he pointed to himself as
evidence that blacks can attain power within the hierarchy.
   ``The majority of us intend to stay in the church and bring
about change, and a lessening of racism,'' Marino said.
   Still, Marino said Stallings might accomplish some good with his
boldness.
   ``I think it has shown the leadership of the church that there
are these concerns,'' Marino said.
   A spokeswoman at Stallings' church, the Imani Temple, said
Thursday the priest had no plans to attend the conference, held by
the National Office for Black Catholics and the National Black Lay
Catholic Conference. The groups represent more than 1 million black
Catholics.
   One speaker during the conference, Morehouse College history
professor Giles A. Conwill, said Stallings could boost black
efforts to improve their standing in the church.
   ``We may not agree with his method of leaving the church but he
is a catalyst,'' Conwill said.
   In his speech, O'Connor stressed that leaders of black Catholics
or of any other ethnic group must not try to teach their own
version of Christianity.
   ``There are some people ... campaigning for all sorts of things
who will promise you a pie in the sky,'' O'Connor said. ``But are
they leading where God wants people to be led?''
   The cardinal said church leadership could do more to expunge
racism from its congregations.
   ``The church leadership must make racism a priority,'' O'Connor
said. ``We must get rid of racism in the hearts of Catholics.''

   National anti-drug director William J. Bennett
is targeting drug users to get them to quit, and he says he'll use
arrests, fines and public embarrassment.
   A draft of Bennett's national drug strategy, obtained Friday,
says he wants drug users to lose their driver's licenses, their
cars, their federal grants.
   And he wants them to get treatment, even if they don't want it,
saying, ``It is time to reexamine the premise that voluntary drug
treatment should continue to be the mainstay of our treatment
system.''
   The strategy calls on states to ``consider expanding the use of
`civil commitment,' whereby addicts are sent by the courts to
residential treatment facilities. Upon their release, they are
required to participate in carefully monitored outpatient
programs.''
   The judicial procedures required in many states for such
involuntary commitment ``are exceedingly cumbersome,'' and the
draft says the federal government will propose a model state
commitment law.
   The plan includes what Bennett referred to last week as
``carrots and sticks.''
   If states want full federal highway funds, they must adopt
policies to revoke the drivers' licenses of people convicted of a
drug offense, the strategy says. If states want federal criminal
justice funds, they must adopt drug-testing programs for all
arrests, prisoners, parolees, those out on bail and throughout
their criminal justice systems.
   If schools, colleges and universities want federal money, they
must implement firm prevention programs, according to the strategy.
   The strategy seeks a 49 percent increase in federal treatment
money for 1990, from the current $621 million to $925 million.
   ``In 1987, about 834,000 individuals received some form of drug
treatment, or one out of every seven people with a serious drug
problem,'' the strategy says. ``There is little doubt that if we
continue to treat only one in seven heavy drug users, treatment
will not make a very large dent in the nation's drug problem.''
   The objectives outlined in the strategy seek 10 percent
reductions in drug use in two years and 50 percent decreases within
a decade. The plan would set up similar reduction targets for
supply, as represented by estimates of illicit drugs coming into
the country and estimates derived from reports of the ease of
obtaining drugs.
   The Domestic Policy Council held its first meeting on the draft
Friday, and an administration source said the ``situation is
fluid,'' with the strategy to undergo revisions before it is sent
to Congress Sept. 5.
   While the strategy does not indicate the total spending proposed
for law enforcement efforts in 1990, it calls for $1.2 billion for
new prisons, expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent and
increases in most law enforcement efforts. President Bush also had
sought $1.2 billion for prisons in his May crime proposals.
   One of the main focuses of the strategy is the use of crack, a
crystallized form of cocaine, in the inner cities.
   ``It is an acid that is fast corroding the hopes and
possibilities of an entire generation of disadvantaged young
people,'' the strategy says. ``They need help. Their neighborhoods
need help.''
   The plan proposes a $200 million increase, for a total of $350
million, in aid for state and local authorities for street-level
law enforcement. It also asks $50 million for the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, $45 million of which would be used
for security improvements at public housing projects. HUD currently
gets $8 million for such security work.
   The plan's proposals include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Subjecting users to fines, community service and having their
names published in the newspaper and prison substitutes.
   _Asking states to enact ``user accountability'' laws that would
include such penalties from drug possession as suspension of
driver's license for one to five years, loss of student loans and
fines.
   _Ensuring a drug-free federal workforce.
   _Promoting drug-free workplace policies in the private sector
and in state and local governments, including clear penalties for
use, with drug testing where appropriate.

   Cuba has banned two Soviet publications because
they allegedly promote anarchy and are fascinated with the
bourgeois American way of life, China's state news agency reported
today.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported from Havana that Cuba's
official Granma newspaper announced the ban on ``News from Moscow''
and ``Sputnik.'' There was no immediate independent confirmation
from Cuba.
   In an editorial titled, ``An Undeferrable Decision, Consequent
With Our Principles,'' Xinhua quoted Granma as saying the two
Soviet publications are ``nearly always controversial when not
substantially divergent from the criteria and essential direction
of the Communist Party of Cuba.''
   It said the publications make apologies for anarchy and
bourgeois democracy, reflect a ``fascination with the U.S. way of
life, and report favorably on ``those in the Soviet Union who deny
the guiding role of the (Communist) party and ... exalt foreign
investment, rediscover private property, question
internationalism.''
   ``We are Marxist-Leninists, we struggle for socialism and
communism,'' Granma was quoted as saying. ``Such publications ...
are not for us.''

<TEXT>
   The premieres of NBC's and ABC's new
prime-time news shows resulted in mixed reviews but relatively good
ratings.
   NBC's ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' made its bow Wednesday
to negative reviews for its cheesy special effects, dull stories
and use of re-creations to illustrate some of its stories.
   But the reviews didn't deter viewers.
   Twenty-two percent of the viewing audience opted for ``YTT,''
putting it several points ahead of reruns on CBS (``Wiseguy'') and
ABC (``China Beach''). It did as well or better than the parade of
entertainment shows NBC has tried in the time period, which no one
network has dominated.
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' is getting a three-week summer
tryout, but isn't on NBC's fall schedule.
   The much more highly publicized debut of ABC's ``PrimeTime
Live,'' pairing Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, formerly of CBS,
got good-to-so-so notices. ``Prime-Time Live'' is a weekly series
from here on out.
   Though it came in last in its time period in the Nielsens,
``PrimeTime Live'' was a dramatic improvement for ABC, which has
been unable to make any headway against NBC's powerhouse Thursday
lineup with entertainment programming, such as ``HeartBeat.'' Most
recently, low-rated ``Thursday Night Baseball'' was in the time
period.
   ``PrimeTime Live'' drew 18 percent of the viewing audience. ABC
normally gets about an 11. A rerun of NBC's ``L.A. Law'' got 21, as
did the movie on CBS, ``Outback Bound.''
   Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales praised ``PrimeTime Live,''
saying, ``Network television experienced a welcome electrical
charge last night.'' He called the premiere ``one of the smoothest
maiden voyages in television history.''
   Other critics were less enthusiastic. Walter Goodman, writing
for The New York Times, said Donaldson and Sawyer ``made a
workmanlike team.'' He said, ``No potatoes will be knocked off
their couches,'' but dubbed the premiere ``a respectable effort.''
   Steve Sonsky of the Miami Herald called it ``a good college try,
but not a must-see yet.''
   The New York Post's Dave Bianculli was not impressed at all.
``This is a show,'' he said, ``that started out with more flash
than substance and with more desperation than direction.''
   The critics were pretty unanimous, though, in criticizing the
NBC program, which featured three co-anchors _ Maria Shriver; Mary
Alice Williams, recently acquired from CNN; and local New York NBC
anchor Chuck Scarborough.
   Los Angeles Times critic Howard Rosenberg started out his
review, ``This is a re-creation,'' then constructed a fictional _
and unflattering _ account of what the three anchors might have
been saying when watching the show:
   ``Scarborough: God, I'm a commanding figure. Notice how I speak
deeply and earnestly, my granite chin thrust toward the camera just
so, implying strength and authority. My eyes have never sparkled
like this before. And I'm having such a good hair day, I can hardly
stand it.''
   Rosenberg, like other critics, was especially bothered by the
network news program's use of re-creations, a device identified in
recent months with syndicated news programs of questionable
journalistic integrity.
   ``Don't the news divisions realize they have enough of a
credibility problem without shooting themselves in the knee this
way?'' wondered Shales. As for the program itself, he said, ``If
you called it journalism as entertainment, you'd be stretching both
terms.''
   Concluded Fort Worth Star-Telegram critic Art Chapman, ``NBC was
not any good at putting together a newsmagazine show yesterday,
it's not any better today. It would be foolish to assume they can
do better tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Telephone Workers in 24 States Prepare For Possible Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Four regional phone companies faced possible strikes tonight
pending negotiations with unions representing 226,000 telephone
operators, linemen and other communication workers in 24 states.
   Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, BellSouth and Pacific Telesis were holding
separate talks with workers represented by the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers on the contracts that expire at midnight.
   The main differences were over health benefits; each of the four
companies, trying to save on medical and insurance bills, were
trying to get unionized employees to pay a larger percentage of
their medical bills.
   The four phone groups are among the seven so-called Baby Bells
that were created as a result of the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup.
   ``We're in what I would call tough negotiations; they're going
to be negotiating quite heavily in trying to meet that deadline,''
said Vira Milirides, spokeswoman for the CWA in Oakland, Calif.
   Workers may stay on the job past the deadline if the issues are
close to settlement, she said.
   Pacific Bell spokeswoman Jill Foley said the company was hopeful
about reaching agreement with the union, which represents 44,000
workers in California and 6,000 in Nevada, 90 percent of the
non-management work force. Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell together
form Pacific Telesis.
   Milirides said the group wants employees to start paying a
percentage of their health benefits, previously paid entirely by
the company, and is offering wage increases of about 5 percent over
three years, which the CWA says is insufficient.
   Pay ranges from about $228 a week for some operators to $650 for
skilled technicians, Milirides said.
   Similar issues were being debated on the East Coast, where
NYNEX, the telephone company for New York and New England, on
Friday raised its offer on health insurance in talks with the two
union locals representing 60,000 workers.
   But Myles Calvey, president of IBEW Local 2222 in Quincy, Mass.,
said he doubted the offer would avert a strike.
   ``It amounts to about $2 a week,'' he said. ``It's not a
substantial increase. It's not something we can accept.''
   He said many employees joined the telephone company because of
its generous benefits.
   ``The membership is really 100 percent behind us on this one,''
Calvey said. ``Most employees could understand if the company was
in some kind of a financial problem, but they've made record
profits.''
   NYNEX spokesman Bob O'Brien said hundreds of management
personnel are ready to take temporary assignments to maintain
service in the event of a strike, and he predicted that customers
would barely notice, since most telephone operations are automated.
   But Calvey contended that customers would quickly see a decline
in service if the unionized operators, service technicians, linemen
and clerical workers walked off their jobs.
   Other down-to-the-wire contracts were taking place in Atlanta,
where BellSouth was negotiating with the CWA on contracts for
64,000 workers in nine states, and in Philadelphia and Washington,
D.C., involving the more than 52,000 Bell Atlantic employees in six
mid-Atlantic states and Washington.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua will
press for the disbanding of the Contra rebel force in talks with
other Central American presidents, and he has the backing of
opposition leaders at home.
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista government and 20 opposition parties
in Nicaragua signed an accord Friday calling for the U.S.-backed
rebel force to be dismantled.
   The issue is expected to top the agenda when Ortega and the
presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa
Rica today open three days of meetings in this Caribbean resort 200
miles north of Tegucigalpa.
   Contra leaders met Friday in Washington with President Bush, who
reiterated his support for their cause. The United States wants the
rebels to remain organized until after general elections next year.
   In the accord signed Friday, the Sandinistas pledge to hold free
and fair elections Feb. 25, without any restraints on campaigning
or news censorship. They also promise to suspend the military draft
from September until after the balloting to prevent it from
interfering with electoral activity.
   The Sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints
by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in
earlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposure
to the public restricted by news censorship.
   ``Even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, the
electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition
wants,'' said Jaime Bonilla of the Independent Liberal Party,
speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties.
   ``The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the
peace process at the summit.''
   The summit of Central American presidents is a follow-up to a
February meeting in El Salvador. At that meeting, Nicaragua
promised to hold democratic elections next year and the five
presidents agreed to devise a plan for disbanding the Contra force.
   The 11,000 rebels and their families are living in Honduran base
camps. They began retreating to the camps near the Nicaraguan
border last year when U.S. military aid ran out.
   The United States is expected to continue giving the Contras
non-military aid until the elections.
   The Bush administration has said it wants to see democratic
change in Nicaragua before the Contras disband. It has not made
clear if that means keeping the Contras together as a fighting
force until the elections.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said Friday in Washington that
the rebels support the same principles laid out in the agreement.
``We are not opposed to the question of reintegrating ourselves
into Nicaragua under democratic conditions. But those conditions
have to be negotiated,'' he said.
   Matamoros said the rebels could stay in Honduras until all
issues are resolved or return to Nicaragua under conditions
negotiated with the Sandinistas.
   Honduras wants the Contras out as soon as possible. President
Jose Azcona Hoyo has said he will present a plan for their
immediate demobilization at the summit.
   The presidents at the summit also are to discuss having U.N.
observers monitor the Honduras-El Salvador and Nicaragua-Honduras
borders.
   Salvador's new rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, has said
he wants to link Contra demobilization to ending the 9-year-old
civil war with leftist rebels in his country.
   El Salvador says Nicaragua is arming the rebels. Nicaragua,
which describes its support for the Salvadoran rebels as moral and
logistical, opposes linking the two issues.
   The Tela summit will be the fifth held under a peace plan that
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica drafted in August 1987 to
negotiate an end to Nicaragua's civil war and leftist insurrections
in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Despite the regional language of the accord, the focus has
consistently remained on Nicaragua.
   The Contras have been at war with the Sandinistas since 1981,
two years after a popular revolution toppled dictator Anastasio
Somoza.
   An estimated 50,000 people have died in Nicaragua's war while
the Salvadoran conflict has claimed about 70,000 lives, most of
them civilians.
   Nearly three generations of political violence in Guatemala have
claimed more than 100,000 lives, the vast majority of them
civilians.

   People smashed windows and fights
erupted early today when a power outage blacked out this beach
resort, but no injuries were reported, police said.
   Sgt. Louis A Koehler of the Dover Township Police Department
said people began to run along the boardwalk in all directions
after the power failed at 12:52 a.m. Scores of police in riot gear
responded, blocking the bridge leading to the island community and
evacuating people from the boardwalk.
   Koehler said police and firemen from Seaside Park, Dover, Brick,
Lakewood and Manchester townships were called in.
   Some people were stuck on amusement rides, but police helped
them off, he said.
   It was unclear how many people were on the boardwalk when power
failed.
   The outage occurred when a substation transformer of the Jersey
Central Power &amp; Light Co. failed, said a company spokesman, James
F. Lowney.

<HEAD>Death Toll From Quake Rises to 116</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue teams have found 19 more
bodies, bringing to 116 the death toll from an earthquake that
triggered landslides in the country's easternmost province, a
government official said today.
   The Social Affairs Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said rescue workers retrieved the bodies Friday from
under demolished houses and masses of earth in the village of Soba,
in the mountainous district of Kurima.
   Soba was the hardest hit of three villages, including Holuan and
Pasema, nearest the quake's epicenter 219 miles south of the
provincial city of Jayapura, 2,188 miles east of Jakarta.
   The official said workers also rescued 20 injured people who
were trapped in the rubble of mountain slopes that were crumbled by
Tuesday's quake, which measured 6 on the Richter scale.
   The scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph, and every
increase on the scale means the motion is 10 times greater. A
magnitued of 6 can cause severe damage.
   Authorities have evacuated more than 700 people from the
stricken area, which has a population of about 3,500 people, the
official said.
   ``Rescue workers still are busy searching for missing
villagers,'' he said via telephone from Jayapura. He could not say
how many remained missing, however.
   An official of the Meteorology Office in Jakarta said an
earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 shook the southern coast of west
Java on Friday, but that there were no reports of casualties or
damages. He said the quake was centered in the Indian Ocean, 100
miles south of Jakarta.
   In 1981, more than 300 people were killed in Kurima by an
earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale.

<TEXT>
   Tornadoes touched down in Illinois early today, hours after
thunderstorms rumbled across much of the Midwest.
   Thunderstorms in northeastern Illinois today spawned tornadoes
around Lemont, Orland Park and Joliet, and produced high winds
which downed trees and power lines around Oak Forest.
   Friday night, heavy rains and severe winds ripped the roof off
an apartment complex in Bolingbrook, and caused flooding that left
patients at a Chicago hospital without water or hot food. Doctors,
nurses and ambulance crews worked late Friday to discharge or
transfer about 300 patients from Resurrection Medical Center.
   Elsewhere, severe thunderstorms were moving across Lake Michigan
toward lower Michigan early this morning, producing high winds
which downed trees and power lines.
   Thunderstorms were scattered in southwestern Iowa, northern and
central Kansas, eastern Pennsylvania and eastern New York.
   Showers dampened northern Maine, southern Ohio and central West
Virginia.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also lingered in
eastern Colorado, southern New Mexico and southwest Texas early
today.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hour-period ending at 2 a.m.
EDT included more that 3 inches at Montpelier, Vt., and 1{ inches
at Rome, N.Y.
   On Friday, thunderstorms developing in the warm humid air ahead
of a cold front in the upper Midwest produced severe weather in
southern Wisconsin. Tennis-ball size hail fell at Coon Valley, and
wind gusted to 75 mph at Milwaukee.
   Thunderstorms also produced severe weather in Minnesota, Iowa
and Kansas Friday evening.
   Golf ball-size hail fell at Owatonna and Rushford in southern
Minnesota and in Delaware County in eastern Iowa. Early evening
thunderstorms in north-central Kansas produced high winds which
downed several large trees and took the roof off a farmhouse west
of Tipton.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in eastern Kansas, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, the
Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and the northern and middle
Atlantic Coast; and widely scattered thunderstorms in Florida, the
Gulf Coast, southwest Texas, southern New Mexico and parts of
Arizona.
   Predicted highs: upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and
across North Dakota and northern Minnesota; in the 100s in the
desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 47 degrees
at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming to 91 at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Weekend Brings More Bad Fire Weather to the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Army soldiers set up camp on Idaho and Oregon fire lines today,
just in time for dry, hot weather that had officials worried about
lightning storms.
   Shifting winds pushed a brush fire away from Southern
California's Mount Palomar observatory, which 500 firefighters had
been rushed in to protect earlier Friday.
   Smaller forest, brush and grass fires burned in Nebraska, Utah
and Wyoming.
   More than 21,000 people were at work fighting fires throughout
the West, according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho,
the nation's fire suppression headquarters. Almost 225,000 acres
had been blackened or were burning since a rash of lightning storms
in the middle of last week.
   The fire center has managed so far to get people and supplies
where they are needed most, said spokesman Ken Showalter. ``But if
we get another bust (of lightning-caused fires), things are going
to be challenging.''
   About 1,300 soldiers and support personnel from Fort Carson,
Colo., and Fort Riley, Kan., were arriving in Idaho today, said 8th
Infantry Col. Anthony Trifiletti.
   Another 1,300 soldiers from the 9th Infantry, based at Fort
Lewis, Wash., began setting up camp Thursday in eastern Oregon and
on Friday about half of them began training on relatively safe fire
lines before moving to more hazardous duty today.
   The other half of the contingent from the 9th Infantry, which
served on the fire lines in Yellowstone National Park last summer,
was helping firefighters mop up after a fire at Dooley Mountain
near Baker, Ore., that burned nearly 20,000 acres before being
contained Thursday.
   Residents of the old mining town of Warren, about 50 miles
northeast of McCall, in central Idaho, crossed their fingers while
waiting out the 4,244-acre Wangdoodle fire.
   ``They have retardant lines, handlines, dozer lines and
hoselines in there to protect Warren,'' Payette National Forest
spokeswoman Jeanne Felmy said. Still, the fire could ``hook
around'' and make a run for the buildings in the event of erratic
winds.
   The forecast was for a warmer weekend.
   ``We're in an increasing warming and drying trend,'' said Vance
Persing of the Payette forest. ``If we reach the weather we had
several days ago, things could really start popping.''
   Six major fires and at least four smaller fires in eastern
Oregon had damaged about 82,000 acres of the timber and grazing
land, killing cattle and chasing residents from their homes.
   Cool and moist weather this week has helped firefighters get the
upper hand, said Barbara Kennedy, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman.
   ``But we're getting back to more normal weather now and that
means firefighters are going to have to work extra hard,'' Kennedy
said from a fire camp in the Malheur National Forest.
   In Southern California, about 2,000 firefighters had contained
60 percent of a week-old blaze in the Cleveland National Forest and
officials couldn't say when they might control the fire, said
Forest Service spokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen.
   The 11,000-acre conflagration 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles
burned to within three miles of the historic Mount Palomar
Observatory, the nation's largest optical telescope, before
shifting away, authorities said Friday.
   Astronomers at the observatory, owned by the California
Institute of Technology, were forced to cease their work and close
the observatory to prevent ash from damaging the telescope's $20
million mirror.
   A fire in northwestern Nebraska had rushed through 4,000 acres
of timbered canyon Friday and up to 30 people were evacuated, but
it was declared contained after two South Dakota National Guard
helicopters dumped fire retardant on hot spots. The fire was near
Fort Robinson State Park, which was ravaged a month ago by a blaze
that charred 48,000 acres.
   Firefighters were close to containing a 60-acre brush fire near
Provo, Utah, this morning.

<HEAD>Oldest Shuttle Ready To Fly Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mission scientists began counting
down today for the first flight of the space shuttle Columbia in 3{
years, to release a military reconaissance satellite and a smaller
scientific payload.
   The oldest space shuttle, last launched in 1986, has spent much
of the past few years as a ``hangar queen,'' stripped like an old
car to provide spare parts for its sister ships Discovery and
Atlantis.
   Workers began in earnest last November to put Columbia back
together, under the direction of Ann Montgomery, the first woman to
manage the processing of a shuttle for launch.
   The countdown began at 12:01 a.m. with liftoff between 7:30 a.m.
and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Defense Department will not be more
specific, citing national security but not making it entirely clear
why the secrecy is needed.
   Columbia, which first flew in 1981, last was launched on Jan.
12, 1986, its seventh flight. It returned to Earth on Jan. 18, and
10 days later its sister ship Challenger exploded 73 seconds after
liftoff, killing its crew of seven and grounding the remaining
three shuttles.
   The post-accident investigation dictated more than 200 changes
on each shuttle to improve safety and performance. With a shortage
of manpower and new parts, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration decided that Discovery and Atlantis, newer than
Columbia and more easily refitted, would have priority in the
overhaul.
   For most of the time since then, Columbia languished in a
hangar, with no engines, most of its protective skin torn away, no
workers scrambling around on scaffolds.
   On Sept. 29, 1988, American astronauts returned to space aboard
Discovery. Atlantis followed in December, Discovery flew again in
March and Atlantis again in May.
   NASA several months ago set July 31 as Columbia's launch date.
Launch director Bob Sieck said he's pleased the agency is missing
it by only a few days, considering all that had to be done. ``It
will be a tremendous relief to get this one done,'' he said.
   Once in orbit, Columbia's all-military crew reportedly will
release a 10-ton reconnaissance satellite with high-resolution
cameras, along with a much smaller scientific payload.
   This will be the fourth of 30 shuttle flights dedicated fully to
the Defense Department. As on the earlier ones, the Pentagon is mum
about most details, including the length of the flight _ expected
to be about four days.
   Defense officials would like to launch these military missions
in complete secrecy, but, with thousands of people working on the
shuttle, they know that would be very difficult.
   So the Pentagon allows NASA to announce a four-hour launch
``window'' _ from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, in this case _
and to make the countdown public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff.

   Piedmont Airlines disappeared today as
the carrier joined with USAir in one of the largest mergers in U.S.
aviation history.
   All over the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, the
Piedmont logo was being replaced by USAir's red and blue colors
Friday as officials gathered to bid farewell to the airline founded
more than 40 years ago in North Carolina.
   ``The people of Piedmont are justifiably proud,'' said Patricia
Goldman, a USAIR vice president. ``The only way we can prove we're
as good is by doing a good job.''
   As the midnight deadline approached, few vestiges of Piedmont
could be found at the airport that was the airline's major hub,
with 300 departures a day.
   In early 1987, USAir Group, the nation's eighth largest airline
at the time, agreed to pay $1.6 billion in cash to acquire
Piedmont, the nation's ninth-largest carrier.
   On Friday afternoon, officials, city leaders and a few employees
gathered at Gate 12B to say goodbye to the airline founded by Tom
Davis in Winston-Salem.
   The union will create the country's seventh-largest airline with
a fleet of 426 jets and 48,000 employees. The airline will operate
in 36 states, two Canadian provinces, the Bahamas and Britain.
   ``It was inevitable,'' Ms. Goldman said in an interview.
``Neither of us wanted to merge; we both wanted internal growth.
But one of us was going to be bought, and we wanted it to be
compatible.''

   Forty-one drug smugglers and brothel

capital of Mashad, Iran's official news agency said today.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
executions took place Friday and today.
   The 17 executed in Mashad were hanged in public, the agency said.
   In Tehran, 10 men and 11 women were hanged in Qasr prison, with
the remaining three hanged in a square ``in front of the public in
southern Tehran,'' it said.
   Those hanged in Tehran ``were involved for years in drug
trafficking and organized prostitution,'' said a statement by the

   Those executed in Mashad had been convicted of selling,
distributing and possessing ``200 sacks of opium and tens of kilos
of heroin,'' it said.

<HEAD>Bolivian Congress Elects Paz Zamora as President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaime Paz Zamora, the third-place
finisher in May elections, was elected president of Bolivia
following an all-night debate in Congress, officials said today.
   Paz Zamora garnered 98 of the 156 votes after former dictator
Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez cast his support to the 50-year-old. Paz
Zamora, head of the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary
Left, had been arrested by Banzer in 1974 and accused of trying to
overthrow the government.
   Luis Ossio Sanjines, an ally of Banzer and head of the Christian
Democratic Party, was elected vice president.
   Swearing-in ceremonies for the Bolivian leaders' four-year terms
is scheduled for Sunday afternoon.
   The opposition had held up balloting because of alleged voting
irregularities in the May 7 election.
   No candidate received a majority in the voting, so under
Bolivia's Constitution, the Congress chose from the top three
contenders.
   Squeezed out by the Paz Zamora-Banzer alliance was Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada of the governing Nationalist Revolutionary
Movement.
   Sanchez de Lozada had received 24 percent of the vote in May
while Banzer, who ruled Bolivia from 1971-79, had 23 percent and
Paz Zamora 18 percent.
   The alliance with Banzer assured Paz Zamora of the votes to win
the presidency with their two parties holding 79 of the
congressional seats.
   Bolivia has had more than 100 coups or revolutions since it
gained its independence from Spain in 1825 and Sunday's inaguration
will be the first time in 25 years that a government has completed
its term and transferred power to a democratically elected
president.
   The alliance between Paz Zamora's party and Banzer's
conservative Nationalist Democratic Action could be an uneasy
partnership.
   Paz Zamora was jailed for six months after he was arrested in
1974 and accused of trying to overthrow Banzer.
   Announcement of the alliance came as a surprise to many
Bolivians and led to a run on banks. In two days depositers
withdrew the equivalent of $13 million from the banks.
   Paz Zamora met with business and banking officials Thursday and
told them his government would maintain a free market economy and
the current stabilization program.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro implemented tough austerity
measures when he took over in 1985. They included a restructuring
of state companies, firing 23,000 government-employed miners, a
ten-fold increase in the price of gasoline and a wage freeze. The
measures lowered inflation from 24,000 percent in 1985 to an
estimated 6 percent for 1989. Paz Estenssoro is Paz Zamora's uncle.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said Friday, ``We expect to have
a very good relationship with this government and Paz Zamora has
indicated to me his interest in attracting foreign investments to
Bolivia.''
   Paz Zamora is the son of a career army officer.
   He attended a Roman Catholic seminary in Argentina but then went
to Belgium, where he was active in university politics.
   When he returned to Bolivia in 1971 he founded the Movement of
the Revolutionary Left and advocated armed struggle to overthrow
Banzer, who seized power in a coup in 1971.
   After he was released, Paz Zamora went into exile abroad. He
came back to Bolivia in 1977 and resumed his political activities.
   In 1980, his party formed a coalition with the Communist Party
and the Leftist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement under the
leadership of Hernan Siles Zuazo and the coalition won the election.
   A military coup in July 1980 blocked the installation of Siles
Zuazo as president and Paz Zamora as vice president. In 1982, the
military stepped down and turned over the government to Siles Zuazo.
   Siles Zuazo and Paz Zamora stepped down in 1985, a year before
their terms expired, because of social unrest and political
pressure. During the Siles Zuazo administration inflation reached
24,000 percent and strikes were a daily ocurrence.
   Paz Zamora ran for the presidency in 1985 and finished third
with 8 percent of the vote.

   Hurricane Dean's northward drift away from the
northern Caribbean islands and the southeastern Bahamas prompted at
least a temporary cancellation of hurricane watches and warnings.
   ``Right now it looks as though the hurricane is heading towards
Bermuda,'' said National Hurricane Center meteorologist Jesse
Morre. ``If it continues moving as it is right now, we think a
watch may be needed later today.''
   ``There's just that little dot in the ocean,'' Morre said of
Bermuda, ``and right now, it's heading towards that dot.''
   At 6 a.m. EDT Saturday, the 5-day-old hurricane with winds of 85
mph was centered near 24.3 north latitude and 63.9 west longitude,
about 550 miles south of Bermuda. It was moving northward at 12 mph.
   A weakening of upper atmosphere winds that steer the storm kept
Dean away from the islands Thursday. The hurricane remained
stationary most of Thursday night.
   Earlier reports that said the storm was headed towards Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands sparked a rush on stores for supplies.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became a
tropical storm Monday night and passed the hurricane threshold of
74 mph winds Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners blasted
residential neighborhoods in vicious all-night shelling duels
around the Beirut area, killing 21 people and wounding 82, police
said today.
   Ten of the victims died and 40 were wounded in the underground
shelter of an apartment building in Beirut's Christian suburb of
Fayadiyeh, a police spokesman said. It was hit by a salvo of three
240-mm mortar rounds fired by Syrian gunners.
   The latest casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 537
killed and 2,266 wounded in a 20-week-old confrontation between
Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops and the 40,000
Syrian soldiers in Lebanon.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the three mortar rounds pierced the parking lot
of the 10-story apartment building and exploded in the underground
shelter.
   ``Part of the building collapsed on the shelter, and victims
were buried under the rubble,'' he said.
   Several ranking officers of Aoun's army live in Fayadiyeh, a
wealthy suburb three miles east of Beirut.
   The spokesman said soldiers evacuated most of the casualties in
armored personnel carriers. ``It was very risky for ambulances to
operate due to intensity of the barrage,'' he said.
   He said most of the casualties, although civilians, were taken
to the military hospital in Christian east Beirut.
   The fighting started about 10 p.m. Friday, sending civilians to
basements and underground shelters.
   The police spokesman said the barrage began as ``kind of the
usual artillery exchange,'' with Syrian howitzer batteries
targeting the Christian-controlled coastline north of Beirut to
blockade shipping and Aoun's gunners retaliating with attacks on
Syrian emplacements in west Beirut.
   He said the Syrians ``escalated the exchange by deploying the
240mm mortars in the battle and targeting the shelter.''
   Aoun's gunners and their right-wing Christian militia allies,
the Lebanese Forces, entrenched in the Christian enclave
``responded heavily,'' the spokesman added.
   He said Christian militia gunners fired their Soviet-made
multi-barrelled rocket launchers on residential districts in Moslem
west Beirut, spitting out 40 rockets per minute.
   The Christians control a 28-mile stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile
Mediterranean coast north of Beirut.
   The Christian enclave, home for about 1 million people, has been
besieged by Syrian and allied Moslem forces in retaliation for a
blockade by Aoun's forces of ports run by Syrian-backed militias
south of Beirut.
   An Arab League committee trying to mediate an end to the
fighting said earlier this week it had reached an impasse and
blamed Syria for blocking its 2-month-old mission.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, and other Christian leaders
accuse the Syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from
the 22-nation Arab League by supporting Moslems against Christians
in the 14-year-old civil war. Moslems are seeking a greater share
of political power in Lebanon, which has been dominated by the
Christian minority.

<HEAD>Fatah Officials Reject Hard-Line Challenge, Back Arafat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has comfortably
survived a challenge by hard-liners in his Fatah movement
questioning his renunciation of terrorism and recognition of
Israel's right to exist, a political adviser said today.
   ``There were some tense debates on political questions, brought
about by the hard-liners,'' said Nabil Chaath, political adviser to
Arafat. ``But, in fact, this has become largely Arafat's congress.''
   He was speaking outside the first congress held since 1980 by
Fatah, the main component of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Most of the 1,000 delegates at the conference backed Arafat and
rejected the challenges to his leadership, Chaath said.
   The hard-liners ``have turned out to be less numerous and less
noisy than some of the top Fatah leaders had feared,'' he said.
   All substantive discussions of the congress have been held
behind closed doors. The only journalists admitted are Palestinians
who also are Fatah delegates.
   On its first two days, the congress gave its full backing to the
peace initiative adopted at Arafat's urging last November by the
Palestine National Council, Chaath and other delegates said.
   Specifically, as reported by delegates and the Palestinian news
agency WAFA, the congress approved the council's proclamation of an
independent Palestinian state, endorsed Arafat's acceptance of U.N.
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, which guarantee the right
of all states in the region to live within secure borders, and gave
full support to the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   In an impassioned speech before the congress Friday, his 60th
birthday, Arafat vigorously defended the peace plan and obtained
Fatah's almost unanimous approval, delegates said.
   The main task of the congress, the fifth since the movement was
founded in Kuwait in 1959, is to renew and enlarge membership of
the Central Committee, of which Arafat is chairman.
   The panel has been reduced to 10 members by three assassinations
and two departures of dissidents. The Central Committee is to be
enlarged to 20 or 21 members.
   Several hard-liners at Friday's sessions challenged the
timeliness and effectiveness of Arafat's peace moves, delegates
said, and the PLO leader spoke repeatedly in the debate to defend
his actions.
   WAFA reported Friday that the congress proved Fatah has overcome
its internal divisions and regained its unity following widespread
defections in 1983.
   The congress has split into political, financial and
organizational committees and is scheduled to close Monday, but
delegates said it could well be extended for several days.

   Soviet favorite Vasily Ivanchuk won
the grandmaster tournament at the 22nd Bienne Chess Festival after
a final-round victory over Ferdinand Hellers of Sweden.
   Lev Polugaevsky of the Soviet Union finished level with Ivanchuk
on points as the 14-round tourney ended late Friday. But the
world's third-ranked player was ahead due to a higher total of
Sonneborn-Berger points, a fine ranking used for tiebreaks.
   The 20-year-old Ivanchuk, playing white, attacked with gusto to
defeat Hellers in 40 moves and secure his first Bienne title.
Polugaevsky, 54, needed 53 moves to beat Nick de Firmian of the
United States in his last-round match.
   Ivan Sokolov, co-winner of last year's tournament, posted a
surprise win over U.S. player Anthony Miles to capture third place.
   Results:
   _ Vlastimil Hort, West Germany - Eugenio Torre, Philippines,

   The House ethics committee can now begin
interviewing witnesses and receiving documents as it proceeds with
preliminary investigations of three lawmakers accused of sexual
misbehavior.
   The committee on Friday announced preliminary inquiries into the
conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill., Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif., to determine if there's ``a reason
to believe'' rules violations occurred.
   Bates denied any wrongdoing. Lukens' press aide said the Ohio
congressman welcomed ``a full and open investigation.'' Savage, who
also has denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment.
   If the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as the panel
is formally named, decides ``there is reason to believe'' a
violation occurred in any of the cases, it could issue a statement
of alleged violation, similar to an indictment. Later in the
process, the committee could hold disciplinary hearings and
eventually recommend punishment to the full House.
   The House Republican Conference, composed of all Republicans in
the chamber, asked the ethics panel to investigate Lukens, who was
convicted in Ohio on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness of a child. Lukens, who is appealing, was sentenced June
30 to 180 days in jail and fined $1,000 for having sex with a
teen-age girl.
   The committee said the complaint alleged that Lukens' conduct
violated a House rule which states, ``A member, officer, or
employee of the House of Representatives shall conduct himself at
all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House
of Representatives.''
   Jarrell, Lukens' press aide, said the Ohio Republican ``has
already said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his
accusers' motives and the full record can be brought forth.''
   He added that Lukens would be able to bring the committee
information about the credibility of the teen-age girl and her
mother, which was ruled inadmissible for the trial.
   Three House Democrats filed a complaint against Savage this
month, after news accounts said a Peace Corps volunteer complained
the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in Zaire.
   The ethics panel said it ``has been presented with complaints
concerning the actions of Rep. Gus Savage while that member
traveled to Africa in connection with his official duties and
responsibilities in March 1989.''
   Since the incident, the State Department inspector general has
sent investigators to collect information on Savage's actions
during official foreign travels, according to a House member who
would speak only as an unnamed source.
   News accounts this week said that when Savage was in China in
1986 as part of a delegation from the House Science and Technology
Committee, he revised his schedule and went to Hong Kong and South
Korea for shopping and sightseeing.
   Savage told reporters two weeks ago, ``I did nothing, that's
what I did. This lie was leaked by the State Department for
political reasons.''
   The complaint against Bates was filed last year by two former
aides, according to published reports. The committee said it ``has
been presented with sworn complaints from two individuals against
Rep. Jim Bates, alleging that they were sexually harassed by Rep.
Bates and that congressional staff and resources were used to
perform campaign-related activities.''
   Bates said, ``I would deny they were sexually harassed and that
the staff and resources were used to perform campaign-related
activities _ at least under my direction.''
   Bates added, ``I look forward to having the matter resolved. It
has gone on for a year without any action. I would like it
resolved. I don't think it warrants a preliminary inquiry, but if
the committee does, we'll cooperate in any way we can.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., disclosed Friday the
Senate Ethics Committee has completed its preliminary inquiry of
his previously revealed book publishing contract _ and voted to
proceed with the investigation. Washington attorney Robert Bennett
has been hired by the committee as special counsel to continue the
probe, Durenberger said.
   Durenberger, whose deal netted him $100,000 over two years,
received income from a publisher who charged ``book promotion
fees'' to groups that sought the senator as a speaker. A complaint
from Minnesota lawyers who backed Durenberger's 1988 re-election
opponent, Hubert H. Humphrey III, accused the senator of
circumventing rules limiting speaking fees members can earn.

<HEAD>Britain Reports Fire on Nuclear Submarine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FASLANE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An electric motor in a British nuclear
submarine caught fire today while the vessel was berthed in
Scotland, but crewmen quickly extinguished the flames, the Defense
Ministry said.
   No one was injured, and no radioactivity leaked out, Ministry
officials said.
   The fire broke out shortly after midnight in an electric motor
on the submarine HMS Valiant, a Ministry spokesman in London said.
The vessel had returned to its base in Faslane on the River Clyde
in southwest Scotland after a $88 million refitting.
   HMS Valiant, launched in 1963, is the Royal Navy's oldest
nuclear-powered submarine. When on duty at sea, it is armed with
surface-to-surface, conventional missiles and non-nuclear Tigerfish
torpedoes. It carries a crew of 116.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping
with British practice, said the motor that caught fire is part of
the hydraulic system. He said the fire posed no danger to the crew
or the nuclear reactor.
   ``It was nothing to do with the nuclear side of things. It was a
mechanical problem. It was nowhere near the reactor,'' he said.
   The hydraulic system drives some equipment on the submarine,
including the periscope and hatches.
   The spokesman said he had no details of damage or exactly how
the fire started. However, he said crewmen put it out within 15
minutes.

   Air Force officials say they are investigating
an engineering officer in their Electronic Security Command for
what a television network reported is suspicion of selling secrets
to the Eastern Bloc in Berlin.
   Lt. Joe Wiggins, a spokesman for the command in San Antonio,
Texas, said Friday night that the officer, Capt. John Vladimir
Hirsch, has been restricted to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.
   Wiggins said Hirsch, who was head of engineering and
installation at the Air Force's electronic security wing at the
West Berlin Templehof Central Airport, was formally placed under
investigation when he returned from Germany earlier this week.
   Another command spokeswoman said the wing collects intelligence
on East Bloc radar and communications.
   NBC News reported Friday that Hirsch is suspected of selling
secrets to the Eastern Bloc while he was stationed in Berlin after
September 1988.
   ``He is not under arrest and he has not been charged with
anything,'' said Wiggins, who would not confirm what the
investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
concerns. ``There is an investigation that is ongoing,'' he said. .
   According to NBC, Hirsch failed a lie detector test last week in
Berlin.
   The network also reported the Air Force found uncashed
paychecks, evidence of bank accounts totaling more than $120,000,
photographs of Western military installations and other classified
documents in his Berlin home.
   Hirsch also made several unexplained trips to France, Austria
and Italy during the last three years, NBC reported.
   Wiggins said Hirsch came under suspicion during the routine
review of his security clearance.
   ``The investigation resulted from normal security procedures we
employ to monitor security clearance,'' said Wiggins.
   Lt. Erlinda Baker, a public affairs officer with the Electronic
Security Command, said the command works on communications and
electronic combat capabilities, including ways the Air Force
protects its radar from being jammed.
   Hirsch, 33, lists Cleveland Heights, Ohio, as his permanent
residence and has been with the Air Force since 1979, said Baker.
He was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and became a U.S. citizen in
1971.

<TEXT>
   Kenya is increasing security in its
national parks and trying to reassure visitors following widespread
publicity about the slaying of a Connecticut tourist in a game
reserve.
   The increased security comes amid a clamor by politicians and
the press over what they say is unfair treatment by the Western
news media.
   ``It's War Against Slanted Reports,'' said a headline in
Saturday's Kenya Times, a Nairobi newspaper owned by the country's
only legal political party.
   The accompanying story reported the outraged comments of more
than half a dozen party leaders decrying news coverage of the
murder of Marie Ferraro, 50, of Bethany, Conn.
   Typical was that of Joseph Kamotho, secretary-general of the
governing Kenya African National Union, who said reports of the
slaying were overblown and intended to scare off tourists.
   More than 700,000 visitors brought nearly $350 million into
Kenya's economy last year, making tourism the country's biggest
single source of hard currency.
   In an editorial Friday, the independent Daily Nation said the
American press had painted ``Kenya as a benighted country of
bloodthirsty and crime-prone people.
   ``Let us face it,'' the editorial continued, ``there is more
crime in that metropolis called New York than there is in'' all of
Kenya, a country the size of Texas with a population of 22 million.
   A gang of armed men attacked Ms. Ferraro's tour group July 28 on
a dirt road between Tsavo and Amboseli national parks in
southwestern Kenya.
   The killers, believed to have been poachers, have not been
captured.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists in Kenya's
national parks that began last September. Gunmen have killed three
visitors and seriously wounded three.
   Nonetheless, in ordering increased ground and aerial
surveillance of the parks, Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo
called Ms. Ferraro's slaying ``an isolated incident.''
   He said police, in consultation with tour operators, will
provide armed escorts for tour groups in some of the country's
largest and most popular parks.
   Tsavo, divided by Kenya's main highway into two reserves,
contains more than 8,000 square miles of land, much of it remote
and nearly inaccessible.
   The attacks on tourists have coincided with a crackdown on ivory
poachers, who have reduced Kenya's elephant population from 65,000
in the 1970s to about 17,000 today.
   Some observers have speculated that the poachers now have turned
to robbing tourists.

<HEAD>Conferences to End Wars in Indochina: A History of Failure</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If history repeats itself, the latest international
effort to end war in Indochina is doomed.
   Again and again, Western attempts to cobble together peace
settlements for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have proved abortive or
short-lived. The clinking of champagne glasses in European salons
soon was echoed by gunfire in faraway jungles and rice paddies.
   The latest such conference seeks a comprehensive peace package
for Cambodia, a country torn apart by war, revolution and foreign
invasion for the past two decades.
   Nineteen nations, including the United States, the Soviet Union
and China, are trying to establish a mechanism to monitor Vietnam's
troop withdrawal from Cambodia and reconcile the warring sides: a
three-party guerrilla coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
and the Hanoi-backed government in Phnom Penh.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the Khmer
Rouge, which had turned the country into a murderous experiment in
ultra-revolution. The Khmer Rouge are partners in Sihanouk's
coalition and present a major threat to the complex peace process.
   The past hangs heavily over the Paris conference hall where the
monthlong meeting is taking place.
   In opening speeches, several foreign ministers alluded to former
failures: piecemeal, big-power arrangements that papered over stark
differences and ignored realities.
   On Jan. 27, 1973, Washington and Hanoi signed accords in Paris
that allowed U.S. ground troops to pull out of Vietnam after
leaving more than 50,000 dead on the battlefield.
   President Nixon hailed the results of four years of negotiations
between his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and Vietnam's Le
Duc Tho as ``peace with honor.'' Reporters in some areas of
Vietnam, however, could barely hear radio reports from Paris about
the cease-fire because of the fighting around them.
   Neither the United States' ally, South Vietnam, nor the Viet
Cong guerrillas of the south had been much consulted by the main
protagonists. Cambodia was largely ignored.
   Two years later, communist forces swept into Saigon, and the
Khmer Rouge began its reign of terror.
   Some historians trace the roots of the Indochinese tragedy to
another Paris conference, which followed World War I in 1919.
   Gathering in the palace of Versailles, the victors sought a new
global order but tended to ignore aspirations of peoples under
colonial rule.
   Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's future revolutionary leader, tried to
argue his case for greater emancipation from French rule but was
unceremoniously shown the door. The struggle for freedom was taken
to secret communist cells.
   Ho returned to France after World War II, hoping to negotiate
independence. The Vietnamese arrived at Fontainebleau, near Paris,
and finding few preparations for the meeting, went fishing in the
Atlantic.
   The French were finally routed by Ho's communists at the battle
of Dien Bien Phu, which ended May 7, 1954. The next morning in
Geneva, an international conference, which included the United
States, the Soviet Union and China, took up peace in Indochina.
   Unlike the current meeting, where even enemies smile at one
another, the Geneva conference was held at the height of the Cold
War. U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles refused to shake
hands with China's Chou En-lai.
   Its involvement in the Korean War made China eager to avoid
another conflict with the United States and its allies. Thus, Chou
did little to push the cause of his Vietnamese communist friends
who felt cheated and betrayed. Washington took few initiatives.
   Vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel pending general
elections in 1956. Ho's communists took control of the north, while
the south moved toward alliance with the United States.
   The elections never were held. The partition lasted 21 years,
and war soon erupted with U.S. forces coming to South Vietnam's aid.
   An International Control Commission that was to have overseen
the implementation of the Geneva agreement could not carry out its
task, a fate that also befell the ICCs in post-1973 Vietnam and
Laos.
   ``We served on such a commission for 19 years. It certainly
wasn't a resounding success,'' Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark
told reporters at the current conference, which hopes to establish
an international commission to monitor the Vietnamese troop
pullout, a cease-fire and general elections in Cambodia.
   Clark and others agree that to succeed, the commission must have
a clear mandate, cooperation from all warring parties, and operate
within the framework of a comprehensive peace plan.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former director of Italy's central bank, Paolo
Baffi, has died after a long illness, the bank announced Saturday.
He died the day before his 78th birthday.
   The bank did not disclose the illness. It said Baffi died Friday
night.
   Baffi, one of the major economic figures in postwar Italy,
worked for 40 years with the Bank of Italy, the country's central
bank.
   As its governor from 1975-79, he shaped Italian monetary policy.
He introduced the statistical system still in use today to analyze
monetary and credit issues.
   Bank Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi called Baffi ``the critical
conscience'' of the bank.
   Baffi left the bank in 1979 but remained honorary governor. In
recent years, he collaborated with a national commission preparing
a new energy policy. He pleaded for a more cautious approach toward
nuclear energy.
   Funeral services were scheduled Monday.

   President Hosni Mubarak met today with a
senior U.S. official making his first regional tour to explore
Arab-Israeli peace prospects.
   The main topic of John Kelly's talks is an Israeli peace plan
calling for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Elected
Palestinians would then negoiate with Israel on limited self-rule.
   Mubarak received Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, at the presidential residence. Reporters were
barred, but the meeting was reported by official Cairo Radio and
the state-owned Middle East News Agency.
   The agency quoted Kelly as saying only that the talks dealt with
Arab-Israeli peace efforts and events in Lebanon.
   Kelly arrived in Cairo on Friday from Israel, his first stop on
a three-nation trip that will also take him to Jordan. The trip is
his first to the area after his appointment this year.
   U.S. diplomats have said Kelly's program was confined to talks
with government leaders and he had no plans to meet in Cairo with
representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   During his Israeli visit, Kelly met with 13 Palestinians from
the occupied lands. Though not PLO officials, they support the
organization.
   Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist group.

   Bakeries in this North African nation
reopened Saturday after a 24-hour strike when the government agreed
to discuss bakers' grievances, including demands for a 25 percent
price increase.
   But a government statement also said the work stoppage was
illegal and called on striking bakers to ``show a sense of
responsibility and perform their function for society.''
   When most bakeries went on strike Friday, huge lines formed
outside the few that still were making bread.
   Bakers are demanding an increase in the price for a standard
loaf of French bread from 13 cents to 16 cents. People in this
former French colony generally eat French-style bread.
   Bread is heavily subsidized in Tunisia, and a steep price
increase in 1983 triggered widespread rioting.

   The Daily Mail has joined the exodus of newspapers
from Fleet Street, publishing its final edition in its old home
Saturday.
   Champagne and sentimentality flowed Friday night as reporters
and editors prepared the last edition before packing off to new
quarters in Kensington, west London.
   ``It was just like a village, a little colony where you could
bump into more friends and rivals in a few yards than anywhere else
I've ever found,'' said Ian Brown, a reporter and veteran of three
decades in the street.
   The Mail and its sister papers, the Evening Standard and Mail on
Sunday, were not actually based on Fleet Street, but between the
street and the Thames.
   The last newspaper with a Fleet Street address was the Daily
Express and its sister the Daily Star, which left in April.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, and Reuters
remain on Fleet Street, and the Daily Mirror still is published
nearby on Holborn.

   Opposition leaders praised an accord
with the Sandinista government on next year's elections as the
foundation for democracy in Nicaragua.
   The accord, signed Friday after 22 hours of talks between the
leftist government and 20 opposition parties, also calls for
disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra rebel force.
   President Daniel Ortega and his counterparts from Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica will discuss the demobilization
this weekend at a summit meeting in Honduras.
   ``The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the
peace process at the summit,'' said Jaime Bonilla of the
Independent Liberal Party, speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20
parties.
   He said that ``even though the opposition is not completely
satisfied, the electoral process is being channeled toward what the
opposition wants.''
   The government promised to put no restraints on campaigning or
news coverage. It also agreed to suspend the unpopular military
draft from September until after the election, scheduled for Feb.
25.
   The Sandinistas began compulsory military service for all men
aged 17 to 25 in 1983, two years after their war with the Contras
began.
   A cease-fire has been in place since last spring, when U.S.
military aid to the rebels ended and the Contras began retreating
to Honduran base camps. About 11,000 rebels and their families are
now living in the camps near the Nicaraguan border.
   The pact is a ``positive base for democratization,'' Alberto
Saborio of the opposition National Conservative Party told a news
conference Friday.
   Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, another conservative leader, said the
accord will enable the opposition ``to keep demanding democratic
guarantees from the Sandinista regime and to continue its
struggle.''
   Luis Sanchez of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party called the pact
``an important political step'' but said it had not resolved
lingering questions about the legal status of oppositon alliances.
   The Sandinistas sought the talks after complaints by opposition
leaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections,
their movements constrained and their exposure to the public
restricted by news censorship.
   The accord also calls for a halt to undercover activities during
the campaign and promises unconditional amnesty to all political
prisoners, including 1,605 rebels in Nicaraguan jails.
   The Sandinistas have been in power since a 1979 revolution that
toppled the Somoza family dictatorship.
   The United States began supporting the Contras in 1982 and
imposed an economic embargo on Nicaragua three years later, arguing
that Sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and their
close military ties with Moscow and Havana threatened security in
Central America.
   ``I hope the U.S. government will respect this sovereign
decision of the Nicaraguan people and change U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua, and that it puts an end to the (1985) economic
embargo,'' Ortega said after signing the accord Friday.

   An Afro-Cuban sect that slaughters chickens,
turtles and sometimes goats as part of its ritual is challenging a
town's ban on the practice, saying it violates religious freedom.
   A trial began last week in the federal lawsuit filed by Santeria
priest Ernesto Pichardo and his Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye in
suburban Hialeah, the first known church in the usually secretive
sect.
   The dispute between the Santeria church and the town of Hialeah
raises questions of religious persecution and animal cruelty as it
delves into the most unsettling Santeria ritual _ animal sacrifice.
   The religion was linked _ mistakenly _ to a sadistic
drug-smuggling cult after human remains were found in Matamoros,
Mexico, last April.
   Experts on Santeria and its practitioners have said that human
bones are not part of any Santeria ritual. But chickens, pigeons,
doves and turtles, and occasionally goats and pigs, are sacrificed
for the initiation of priests, in faith-healing and for help in
love, business and family affairs.
   Sometimes, the animal remains are cooked and eaten, but in some
cases they are left by roadsides or in other public places.
   The trial in Pichardo's lawsuit began Monday and will continue
this week. U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman is hearing the case
without a jury.
   Officials in Hialeah, a predominantly Hispanic city on the edge
of Miami, deny that their efforts to limit Santeria rituals amount
to an attack on religion. Instead, they cite such factors as the
possibility of infection spread by animal carcasses, cruelty to
animals, and the danger that children who witness the sacrifices
will be psychologically scarred.
   In court documents, city attorneys noted that bans on snake
handling and marijuana smoking have been upheld even when the acts
are considered an integral element of a religion.
   Santeria, believed to have more than 50,000 followers in the
Miami area, had its origins in the region of Africa that is now
Nigeria. It was carried by slaves to Cuban sugar plantations,
adopted many Roman Catholic saints as guardians and evolved into a
folk religion that remains largely underground. Most adherents are
Cubans or Cuban-Americans.
   Pichardo, 34, says he is trying to remove the stigma against the
religion as a low-class practice and institutionalize its rituals,
which previously have been performed largely in private homes.
   After he announced plans for his church in 1987, the city
delayed its opening with extensive zoning and building code
requirements.
   ``Once we complied with everything they threw at us, then it
became an animal sacrifice issue,'' said Pichardo.
   The council voted to outlaw sacrifices, allow animal slaughter
only for human consumption, prohibit the possession of animals for
slaughter or sacrifice, and incorporate the state animal cruelty
law in city ordinances.
   Pichardo accuses city council members of discrimination and
misusing their political power because of their personal religious
convictions.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, a witness for the church, testified last week
that most Santeria adherents ``are practicing it because of white
magic or neutral magic'' to produce good results, not to hurt
others. As chief deputy medical examiner in Dade County, he has
studied Afro-Caribbean religions as part of his work.
   In Santeria ceremonies, a few feathers are sometimes plucked
from live chickens, but never all of them, he said. A bisected goat
left on a Miami Beach street and cases when human bones _
apparently obtained after people died of normal causes _ have been
boiled in cauldrons were, in his view, signs of a different
Afro-Caribbean cult called Palo Mayombe.
   Pichardo said Santeria's history of practice in the home hurts
his effort to bring the religion into the open, and may have
contributed to the mistaken link of Santeria to the Matamoros mass
killings this spring.
   The alleged leader of the Matamoros cult, Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, was a Cuban-American raised in Miami around Santeria
practices, but the cult's use of human bones in its rituals
deviated from accepted Santeria principles.
   ``It sets off this domino effect and sort of darkens the idea in
people's minds of what we are,'' Pichardo said. But the attention
generated by the mass murders also helped educate the public, he
said.
   ``There is an enormous lack of material in English that
seriously deals with the subject matter,'' Pichardo said, ``which
allows for a lot of myths to roam around.''

   A sense of businesslike calm pervaded the
101st Congress as lawmakers left for a month-long vacation, but
storms loom ahead when they return to face a series of
long-deferred divisive issues, from child care to the minimum wage.
   ``We've gotten the easy stuff out of the way,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., a member of the House Republican leadership.
``September and October are going to be much tougher.''
   For the moment, members of Congress were content to marvel at
what they had accomplished so far despite a year marred by ethics
problems and other internal conflicts.
   Leading the list was a compromise bailout plan for the nation's
ailing savings and loan industry, the costliest financial rescue in
the nation's history. The bill, which also imposes strict new
controls on the industry, was worked out in concert with the White
House.
   The House also finished initial work on the 13 spending bills
that are the essentials of keeping the government running, and
steps had been taken toward strengthening the Clean Air Act and
meeting the year's budget deficit reduction target. The Senate,
too, was well into the process of dealing with spending measures.
   ``We've picked up ground,'' said Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., the
House minority leader. Michel and others gave credit to new Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who two months ago assumed leadership of
a chamber bitterly divided and virtually paralyzed by the
resignation of former speaker Jim Wright over ethics charges.
   ``It's friendlier,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2
GOP leadership official. ``The entire mood of the House is more
productive.''
   But while Foley has restarted the machinery of the House, which
has responsibility for initiating tax and spending bills, he has
yet to define a legislative agenda and point the way for the
Democratic majority.
   ``As far as the issue of comity, I think there is a much better
relation between the two parties and cooperation between the two
leaderships here in the House,'' Foley said. He noted that the
House had passed some 150 bills since he assumed the speakership,
as many as had been passed in the previous five months.
   But Democratic leadership aides acknowledge that progress thus
far has come on legislative nuts and bolts that have not been a
true test of leadership or party cohesion. September and October,
when Congress returns, will be a time of ideological definition for
Democrats, they said.
   Foley _ the party's highest elected official _ began that
priority-setting process last week in a private luncheon with the
Democratic chairmen of House committees, beginning to answer the
question of where his party's perspective differs from that of Bush.
   ``Bush's time to set the agenda has run out, and Democrats now
have to answer that question for themselves,'' said a top party
aide, speaking only on condition of anonymity. He acknowledged that
a sharper drawing of party lines also will bring conflict.
   ``The major substantive battles are yet to come,'' said Rep. Vin
Weber of Minnesota, an influential Republican. ``We will be seeing
the issues that will translate into the next election: child care,
taxes, economic growth. The stage could be set for some fairly good
battles.''
   Other than progress on the 13 major spending measures, the list
of bills passed so far this year is fairly modest: Items like a
$900 million farm drought relief bill, natural gas price decontrol,
protection for government whistleblowers, and a $1.2 billion
supplemental money bill for veterans programs.
   Congress also, earlier in the year, reached agreement with
President Bush on a budget outline for the year and on a bipartisan
accord on policy toward Nicaragua that provided continued
humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels.
   But after early expressions of bipartisanship and cooperation,
conflicts with the White House have proliferated in recent months:
   _ Bush vetoed an increase in the minimum wage and the House
failed to override it, leaving the issue moribund. Democrats vow to
revive it this fall.
   _ The House gutted Bush's defense priorities, cutting funds for
the B-2 stealth bomber, the strategic defense initiative, the rail
garrison MX missile and the midgetman missile, while restoring
money for two programs he did not want, the V-22 Osprey and the
F-14D fighter. The White House hopes to win reversals of some of
those positions in a House-Senate conference.
   _ The House approved a list of sanctions against China which
went beyond what Bush wanted in the wake of Beijing's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   _ Both the Senate and House voted to restrict the joint
U.S.-Japanese development of the FSX fighter aircraft, a move Bush
vetoed on July 31.
   An even longer list of problem issues lies ahead: whether to use
federal money or offer tax credits to subsidize child care; whether
to ban flag burning through a law or a constitutional amendment;
how to concoct a new and stronger clean air law; and whether to
seek a compromise on the minimum wage.
   ``While Tom Foley is no Jim Wright _ he is not manipulative _ he
is nonetheless a partisan, liberal Democrat,'' said Edwards. ``I
don't anticipate a real smooth session.''

   Johann Strauss conducted Viennese waltzes in its
restaurant, Anna Pavlova danced in the ballroom, and Claude Monet
painted his impressionist views of the Thames from a fifth-floor
suite.
   The Savoy, the distinctly English dream hotel, on Sunday marks
100 years of catering to high society, providing an opulent,
discreet and dramatic rendezvous for celebrities, magnates,
potentates and royalty.
   Modeled on the great American hotels of the day, the Savoy was
built by impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte adjoining his Savoy
Theater, home of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. From the
outset, it was a byword for exclusivity.
   Princess Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth II, first danced here
with Prince Philip. Winston Churchill got the word he had become
prime minister at the Savoy and held War Cabinet meetings in the
Pinafore Room.
   Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sent his dirty linen from the battle
front. The Maharaja of Patiala had 3,000 roses delivered daily.
Rock singer Elton John left his bath running and flooded three
floors.
   ``Forty years ago, people were excluded mainly because of
money,'' said Stanley Jackson, 78, author of ``The Savoy: A Century
of Taste.''
   ``There's now a more international flavor, an infiltration which
rather destroys the ultra-snobbishness.
   ``The hotel is not snooty or over-introverted. It has kept a
good balance. You've got your dukes and your Sinatras, and they
seem to mix very well together,'' Jackson said in an interview.
   Single rooms go for 140 pounds, or $224 a night, while a suite
can cost as much as 520 pounds, about $832.
   When it opened in 1889, the Savoy was a wonder of the Victorian
age, with 24-hour room service, speaking tubes on every floor, and
67 bathrooms at a time when its most luxurious rival, the Victoria,
had just four.
   Oscar Wilde scorned the built-in washstands, saying that if he
wanted hot water he would ring for it.
   All 202 rooms have buttons marked waiter, valet and maid. The
hotel still insists on its own custom-made mattresses, pure linen
sheets and towels. It keeps separate kitchens on all eight floors
and decorates no two rooms the same, using Art Deco and traditional
English country styles.
   The reservation office keeps 120,000 file cards listing the
needs and idiosyncrasies of regular visitors. A staff of 650
attends to 300 guests, who in an average year order 350 pounds of
caviar, 9,500 sides of smoked salmon, 52,000 oysters and half a ton
of foie gras.
   Requests are almost never too eccentric.
   Frank Sinatra hankered after an espresso machine, so the manager
bought one for him. An Italian marquise required live rabbits to
feed his roommates, a pair of boa constrictors.
   In 1905, a South African millionaire flooded the forecourt to
recreate a Venetian canal, and Enrico Caruso serenaded from a
gondola. The Maharaja of Patiala booked 35 rooms and installed a
silver bathtub and a private elevator in scarlet and gold lacquer.
   U.S. golf champion Walter Hagen started a tradition of driving
golf balls off the roof into a barge on the Thames.
   Asked how long he would be staying, Groucho Marx snapped, ``Till
it stops raining.''
   But a visitor from Chicago who bought a bulletproof vest and
summoned a waiter to test it was politely turned down.
   Weekend celebrations include a birthday ball, a tea party and
fair for 320 disadvantaged children, and a firworks display over
the Thames.

   China today disclosed for the first time that 20
people died and 1,200 suffered radiation-related illnesses in
nuclear accidents from 1980-85.
   The official China Daily quoted Luo Guozhen of the State
Environmental Protection Bureau as saying China needed stricter
control over the handling of radioactive waste and that the
government plans to build more disposal sites to handle the
material.
   Several accidents involving nuclear waste have been reported in
the past, but there have been no official disclosures of deaths.
   Luo told the paper that ignorance about the dangers of nuclear
materials and managers who ignored regulations on handling
radioactive waste had caused radiation leaks.
   In February, the China Daily reported an accident that occurred
last December, when some uranium was lost from a factory and 15
people were exposed to radiation. One man suffered third-degree
burns, the report said.
   In 1986, an article by Zhou Zhumou at the Ministry of Nuclear
Industry's Bureau of Safety, Protection and Health said there were
cases of exposure to radiation when China's nuclear industry
started up in the mid-1950s.
   It said that during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern
China.
   Zhou said that about 10 people suffered from overexposure to
radiation in that accident and that another man got uranium
poisoning in an accident in 1973. But he said there had been no
cases of acute radiation sickness.
   The Soviet Union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident.
   In the United States, one man died in an accident in 1986 at the
Kerr-McGee atomic plant in Oklahoma and three people were killed by
radiation at an experimental reactor in Idaho in 1961.
   The China Daily also reported that China plans to begin
construction of nuclear waste sites in eight provinces to handle
its growing production of radioactive material.
   Nuclear dumps already have been built in 12 provinces, it said.
It quoted Luo as saying the only major regions that will not have
waste storage sites after 1990 would be Hainan island and Tibet.
   He said the facilities are needed to handle waste produced by
about 1,000 industries and research establishments across the
country.
   Most of China's nuclear waste so far has been generated by the
military, but growing amounts are being produced by scientific
labs, hospitals and non-military industries.
   Adding to the waste storage problem is the planned December
start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in Zhejiang and the
1992 scheduled opening of the Daya Bay plant in southeast China's
Guangdong Province.
   Earlier this year, the paper reported that China was making
plans for its first permanent nuclear waste dumps to be built in
the coastal Zhejiang province and in northwest China.
   The report in February quoted Pan Ziqiang, director of the
safety department of the state National Nuclear Industry Corp., as
saying that so far all of China's nuclear wastes have been put in
concrete basement facilities and those sites only protect the
material for about 10 years.
   Today's report did not describe the facilities being built.

   A landslide Saturday buried about 45
people who had left passenger buses to clear boulders blocking a
mountain road in northern India, and all were believed dead, news
reports said.
   State-run television said at least 22 bodies had been recovered.
Rescuers were using bulldozers, Press Trust of India said.
   All those buried were feared dead, the agency reported. It also
said 15 people were hospitalized.
   The accident occurred 185 miles north of New Delhi on a national
highway connecting India with Tibet.
   Passengers had left the two buses to clear the road when more
rocks and boulders crashed down on them, Press Trust of India said.
A truck loaded with apples also was buried.

   The Senate itched to be done, but Sen. John
Glenn was irate. He didn't like a proposal to pay 525 government
employees up to $134,250 a year, which is more than senators get.
   ``I think we have within this bill the seeds of the destruction
of the civil service system of the U.S. government,'' said Glenn,
D-Ohio. ``I do not overstate that one iota.''
   But the Senate approved the measure anyway, and went on to vote
to give law enforcement authorities authority to shoot down
airplanes suspected of carrying drugs if the pilots ignore warning
shots.
   The House voted to remodel the old mansion occupied by Dan and
Marilyn Quayle to better accommodate their three children on the
third floor and reversed itself on the question of
taxpayer-supported abortions in the District of Columbia.
   So it goes when Congress wants to go. Airplane tickets in hand,
the Congress was determined last week to get out of town. Measures
that might not have survived more leisurely scrutiny got voted up
or voted down, but disposed of in any event.
   An aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was overheard
to observe that Congress wouldn't be here in any part of August if
the Capitol weren't air conditioned.
   Prayed the chaplain when the Senate met Wednesday: ``Gracious
Father in Heaven, as inevitable tension builds with cosmic issues,
often controversial, occasionally confusing, compounded by the
relentless ticking of the clock, grant to Thy servants in the
Senate cool heads, warm hearts, patience with each other...''
   From time to time a member of Congress arose to warn Middle
Eastern terrorists who threatened to kill hostages that American
patience had its limits.
   President Bush rushed back from an out-of-town speaking swing
and moved ships _ always trouble signals _ but denied that he was
in a crisis mode while working single-mindedly on a diplomatic
solution.
   Meantime, the Congress did its will, and took a couple of
surprise turns.
   The House, voting on a federal contribution to the city's
budget, refused to deny the District of Columbia authority to spend
public funds on abortions for the poor. That move caught all sides
off guard. Bush said he'd veto the measure if it reached his desk
that way.
   Last year, the House had done the opposite, but the Supreme
Court's decision giving states new leeway on abortion has
politicized the issue. With abortion right sentiment strong in
polls, 22 members changed their minds.
   Glenn's ire was aroused by a measure which would raise the pay
of 525 key technicians and scientists in the Defense and Energy
Departments in order to keep competititive with private enterprise.
Members of Congress, by contrast, get $89,500.
   The Senior Executive Association, which, like Glenn, opposes
piecemeal raises, went nuclear in its denunciation: ``an
ill-conceived poisonous stew that will sicken the federal executive
corps.''
   Glenn was equally unhappy with another measure giving law
enforcement agents broad authority to bring down planes suspected
of carrying drugs and other contraband.
   He said if he were flying and another plane approached him, he'd
probably turn tail and run. He lost again. The Senate approved the
measure by voice vote, sending it, and the pay question, to an
uncertain future in the House in the fall.
   As for refurbishing the 1894 Victorian vice presidential mansion
to meet the needs of the Quayle family, plans originally called for
using privately raised funds. But a House appropriations
subcommittee, after sending staff director Aubrey Gunnels to look
the situation over, decided to spend public money. The House
approved $200,000.
   Congress and the White House settled a controversy over whether
the cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry should be
included in the deficit, as Democrats wanted, or left out, as Bush
insisted, again threatening a veto.
   The question was resolved in a classic Washington way: splitting
the difference. House and Senate conferees decided that 40 percent
should be reflected in the deficit, 60 percent left out.
   And while the House waited for the Senate to pass that vital
bill so Congress could quit, it passed the time by passing
resolutions.
   One designated Sept. 8 as National Pledge of Allegiance Day. One
commended the people of Sioux City, Iowa for their help when an
airliner crashed at their airport. And one _ adopted in the nick of
time _ designated next Tuesday as National Neighborhood Crime Watch
Day.

   One of the first Soviet visitors to
tour the USS Thomas S. Gates looked at the cruiser's on-board
helicopter with admiration.
   ``Great helicopter!'' he told aviator Matt Gentry of Seattle.
   ``Great country!'' Gentry responded, gesturing toward shore.
   Around this Black Sea port's streets over the weekend, residents
mingled in friendship with about 600 seamen from the first two
American warships ever to dock here.
   This city of almost 400,000 people, founded as a Greek colony in
422 B.C., often has known visitors of a less welcome variety. Its
strategic position on the Crimean peninsula across from Turkey led
to attacks over the centuries by Turks, French, British, and
Germans.
   On Saturday, Sevastopol residents mobbed the Americans almost
everywhere they went. Many had never seen Westerners because this
port city is headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea fleet and
normally is a restricted zone.
   The Ameircan sailors sampled the wares of a local wine factory,
relaxed in the local officers' club, and shopped in a military
store. They strolled through the seaside town and hobnobbed with
locals, many of whom showered them with gifts and invited them home.
   ``It looks like the Soviets are trying to match what we gave
them,'' said Bill Hayes from Poland, a village in upstate New York.
``So far, it looks like they're doing pretty well.''
   Soviet crews of three ships were feted in Norfolk, Va., last
month as part of the first such Soviet-American exchange of port
calls in 14 years.
   Navigator George Hughes, who is based in Norfolk, set out to
trade some American souvenirs for Soviet items.
   ``My wife wrote me that she did a little trading when the Soviet
fleet hit Norfolk, so I've got to match her,'' he said.
   Soviet gifts to the American sailors included candy, rubles,
children's toys, scarves, flowers, postcards and emblems from
Soviet naval uniforms.
   However, the American ships were ready for the gift exchanges,
said Montana native Pierre Ross, the Gates' chief petty officer.
They had special T-shirts printed up and provided sailors with
pins, hats and other knickknacks.
   Hayes, the Gates' dispersing officer, said his ship's crew of
350 had been given a total of about $10,000 in rubles to spend in
town.
   ``We're especially curious about how the beer tastes,'' he said.
   In a store where Soviet military uniforms are sold and only
Soviet servicemen are normally allowed to shop, two American
sailors were unfazed when told of the store's restrictions.
   ``That's okay,'' one said. ``We're military too.''
   In fact, plenty of American seamen could be seen sporting Soviet
medals and caps. Their own round, white sailor hats graced the
heads of more than a few young Sevastopol women.
   Greg Marlatt, the Gates' medical officer, said he wanted to
spend his time in Sevastopol exploring Soviet medical practices.
   One sailor apologized as he extricated himself from a crowd of
children and adolescents, explaining, ``Sorry, I'm just all out of
pennies.''
   Tours of the American ships, the Gates and the frigate USS
Kauffman, were scheduled to continue until their departure Tuesday.
They arrived Friday.
   A year ago, the city played host to a small delegation with
Frank Carlucci, then U.S. defense secretary. But Navy public
affairs officer Paul Weishaupt said this was the first time U.S.
ships had docked at Sevastopol.
   ``This is a very unusual flag to see here,'' agreed former
Soviet Navy Lt. Valery Karyakin as he looked at the Stars and
Stripes on one of the ships.

   This British colony has appointed its first
ethnic Chinese police commissioner to oversee a transition period
leading to Chinese rule, officials announced Saturday.
   Kwan-ha Li, 52, will head the 27,000-member Royal Hong Kong
Police Force, officials said. A police spokesman said he will take
over from Raymon H. Anning on Dec. 1. Anning is retiring.
   China takes back control of Hong Kong in 1997 under terms of an
agreement with Britain. It has pledged to let this prosperous
colony on the mainland's coast remain capitalist for 50 years after
the takeover.
   Li is expected to bring more ethnic Chinese officers into senior
posts. Expatriates now dominate the high-ranking posts, though 98
percent of Hong Kong's population is ethnic Chinese.
   Li was born and educated in Hong Kong. He first joined the
police force in 1957.
   In March 1988, Sir Ti Liang Yang became the first ethnic Chinese
to serve as chief justice of Hong Kong.

   Nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless
handling of radioactive materials killed 20 people and injured
1,200 in China from 1980 to 1985, an official report said Saturday.
   Luo Guozhen of the State Environmental Protection Bureau said
China needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other
radioactive materials, the official China Daily reported.
   Luo did not say how many accidents occurred from 1980 to 1985,
and he did not give details of those that did occur, according to
the report.
   Ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials, and managers
who ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste, caused
radiation leaks in recent years, the newspaper said.
   It was China's first report on deaths caused by radioactivity.
   China previously has disclosed that nuclear accidents had
occurred, but it did not acknowledge they had caused severe
radiation sickness or deaths.
   There are no nuclear power plants in operation in China,
although two are under construction. Most of China's nuclear waste
so far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are
being produced in laboratories, hospitals and non-military
industries.
   Some of the accidents resulted from workers stealing containers
used to hold radioactive materials.
   In December, a carpenter at an electric equipment plant in
coastal Jiangsu province stole a lead container used to hold cobalt
60, the report said.
   No deaths or injuries have been reported in that case, it said.
   In February, the newspaper reported some uranium had been lost
from a factory, exposing 15 people to radiation.
   In 1986, an article by Zhou Zhumou of the Ministry of Nuclear
Industry's Bureau of Safety, Protection and Health said an
unspecified number of people were exposed to radiation when China's
nuclear industry started up in the mid-1950s.
   During the tumultuous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern
China, Zhou said.
   About 10 people were exposed to radiation in that accident and
another man got uranium poisoning in 1973, but there were no cases
of acute radiation sickness, he said.
   The Soviet Union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident.
   In the United States, One man died in an accident in 1986 at the
Kerr-McGee atomic plant in Oklahama, and three people were killed
by radiation at an experimental reactor in Idaho in 1961.
   Saturday's report says China plans to build nuclear waste
storage facilities to handle the growing volume of radioactive
waste produced by about 1,000 industries and research labs.
   The scheduled start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in
coastal Zhejiang province next December and of the Daya Bay plant
in southeast Guangdong province in October 1992 will mean a
substantial increase in China's production of nuclear waste.
   In the past, China stored radioactive waste in concrete basement
facilities designed to protect the materials for only 10 years,
according to Pan Ziqiang of the China National Nuclear Industry
Corp.
   Luo said waste storage facilities now have been built in 12
provinces and are planned for eight others. He did not describe the
facilities.

<DATELINE>WEEKI WACHEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mermaids of legend glided
effortlessly through the seas, tempting mortals with their beauty
and grace. It's not so easy in real life.
   At Weeki Wachee Spring, hundreds of young women apply each year,
but few show the needed athletic skills, fearlessness and good
looks to perform far under water at one of Florida's oldest tourist
attractions.
   ``It's tough, there is no doubt about that,'' said Genie Young,
mermaid supervisor. ``We have some strict requirements and only a
few of the `girls' actually go on to become mermaids.''
   Forty-two years ago, the enormous freshwater spring with
startlingly clear water, which extends more than 100 feet down, was
turned into a tourist attraction. ``Mermaids'' wearing skin-tight
suits that taper into a dolphin-like tail fin gulp air through
hoses during the choreographed routines viewed by spectators in a
subterranean amphitheater.
   ``We've done a lot of different things,'' said Ms. Young.
``We've eaten bananas and drank Coke underwater. We've recreated
scenes from movies. One of the hardest things was eating a
sandwich. It gets soggy pretty quick.''
   But for beginners, ``I would say the toughest part is learning
to only take in only about half a lungful of air,'' said Ms. Young,
who performed as a mermaid from 1961 to the early 1970s.
``Otherwise, you will float to the surface.''
   The attraction also features an exhibit of photos of living
mermaids, and a shrine to swimmer-actress Esther Williams. Although
never a Weeki Wachee mermaid, Ms. Williams filmed a movie at the
spring and made numerous guest appearances.
   Despite the specter of discrimination suits, Weeki Wachee
remains extremely selective about its mermaids, who now number 26.
   Several attributes are manadatory: an attractive figure and at
least shoulder-length hair, said Ms. Young. But even most of those
with the right looks get shipped back to land following the
swimming test.
   ``The first thing we look for is if you're afraid of the
water,'' said Ms. Young. ``If you're nervous being underwater,
forget it.''
   Applicants must swim for 30 minutes, and perform simple
underwater ballet and acrobatic moves, such as back flips and deep
dives. The few that remain go on to begin serious training and
instructions in how to use the air hoses and swim in various
costumes.
   They start at $4 an hour and it may take up to a year to pass
the apprentice stage, said Ms. Young.
   Marti Worsham, the veteran mermaid of the staff with 16 years of
swimming behind her, recalls watching the mermaids swim around
large flowers when she was a little girl.
   ``From then on, I always wanted to be a mermaid,'' said Ms.
Worsham. ``I never expected I would one day be the one here the
longest.''
   At the end of a show, after the theater had emptied, a mermaid
scrubbed algae from the windows with a steel-wool pad. A turtle
swam nearby.
   ``This is part of the job the tourists don't see,'' said Ms.
Young. ``Cleaning up isn't part of the myth of the mermaid.''

   Iran said today that it refused to
receive a note from the United States on ``events in Lebanon'' amid
reports that Algeria has assumed a leading role in efforts to free
Western hostages.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an unnamed foreign
ministry official in Tehran as saying, ``The U.S. administration
sent a message to Iran's foreign ministry last week through a third
country. Since the content had nothing to do with Iran, the message
was not accepted.''
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the official was responding to
reports that President Bush had appealed to Iran to prevent the
killing of Western hostages in Lebanon. IRNA gave no further
details.
   The Washington Post and several Beirut radio stations reported
today that Bush had specifically asked Algeria to intercede after a
pro-Iranian group said it killed American hostage Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins and another group threatened to kill hostage Joseph
Cicippio.
   In Washington, U.S. officials sought to downplay any negative
interpretation of the IRNA report.
   ``Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weigh
in,'' said one closely involved source who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We have been able to get our messages, one way or
another, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians.''
   Meanwhile Marrack Goulding, head of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations, flew to Beirut by helicopter from south Lebanon for a
third day of talks with Lebanese leaders and then left for Syria.
Goulding is trying to resolve the fate of Higgins and push efforts
to set the hostages free.
   Before leaving for Syria, Goulding told reporters that Algeria
``is playing an extra part in trying to resolve the hostage problem
as Algeria has done in previous cases.''
   He said he had not yet ``obtained concrete proof that Col.
Higgins is dead and I pray he is not dead.''
   An extremist Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organization
of the Oppressed on Earth said it hanged Higgins Monday because
Israel refused to free a Moslem cleric it abducted from south
Lebanon nine days ago. No body ever has been found, and there have
been reports Higgins died months earlier.
   Higgins, 44, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, was head of a
76-man observer team attached to the U.N. Peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon known as UNIFIL when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.
   Sixteen Westerners have been held hostage in Lebanon, the
longest nearly 4{ years. Their plight gained renewed international
attention eight days ago when Israeli commandos kidnapped a Shiite
Moslem cleric with ties to Iran, leading to the threats against
American captives.
   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that a
reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and that he was
willing to help the United States find it.
   ``I tell the White House the problem of Lebanon has solutions,
the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudent
solutions,'' Rafsanjani said in his sermon in Tehran at weekly
Moslem prayers.
   His comments appeared to be the strongest indication yet of a
possible accommodation between the countries since Islamic
fundamentalists ousted the U.S.-backed monarchy in Iran 10{ years
ago.
   Algiers Radio said today that progress was made in talks Friday
involving Algeria's ambassador in Beirut, Khaled Hasnawi.
   Hasnawi said in an interview in today's Washington Post that
Algeria had assigned an official delegation including politicians
and intelligence specialists to the task of ``getting in touch with
the parties holding captives.''
   The radio report said Hasnawi met with the spiritual leader of
Hezbollah _ the group believed to be holding Western hostages _
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, and with Goulding.
   The talks involved all hostages, whether ``Lebanese,
Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis,'' according to the
report. ``Progress in this mediation was accomplished,'' it added
without elaborating.
   State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said Friday that she was
aware of the report but added, ``I have nothing specific on that.''
   Algeria, while proud of its role in mediating past crises,
including the 1981 release of American hostages held in the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, usually is close-mouthed about its involvement
until an issue is settled. The radio report was seen as a sign that
Algerian authorities think a deal is close.
   Today Goulding met with army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who
heads a Christian military cabinet. He also was to meet with acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Syrian-backed mostly Moslem
cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun.
   The Tehran Times published an interview with the head of the
Iranian parliament's foreign affairs committee, Said Rajai
Khorasani, in which he said he ``deeply regretted'' the killing of
Higgins. But he said Israel was to blame.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, one of the kidnapping
groups believed to be fronts for Hezbollah, said Thursday it was
suspending its death sentence against Cicippio and replacing it
with demands that Israel free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's top leaders conferred about a response to
the demands, which Revolutionary Justice said must be accepted
``within days.'' It did not say what would happen to Cicippio if
Israel refused. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   Hasnaw told the Washington Post that Bush had asked President
Chadli Benjedid of Algeria to intercede in the Ciccipio case and
that Fadlallah ``deployed great efforts to defer the execution, for
which he is thanked.''
   ``Following contacts begun yesterday with Hezbollah, in the form
of pleading and entreaties concerning Cicippio's execution, and
after we strongly condemned the abduction of (the cleric) ... we
counseled patience and self-restraint and called for abstention
from dramatic measures and decisions.''
   Had Cicippio been killed, there would have been an
``explosion,'' the Post quoted Hasnawi as saying.
   ``It would have led to a dangerous reaction. America or Israel
would have intervened militarily without anyone knowing the full
scope or nature of such an intervention,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager to
improve ties with the West and erase Iran's image as a sponsor of
international terrorism.
   Israel has offered to trade the cleric and other Shiite
prisoners for three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and for the
Western hostages.
   Of the 16 Westerners held in Lebanon, eight are Americans. Held
longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Attorney General Downplays Difficulties With Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh from stinging defeats in separate
battles with conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh brushes aside talk about his
difficulties with Congress.
   ``I'm a difficult attorney general, I think,'' a smiling
Thornburgh told reporters last week after the Senate Judiciary
Committee killed the nomination of William Lucas, his choice to be
assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   In making the comment, Thornburgh seemed to revel in the prickly
side of his personality, which surfaces frequently in flashes of
anger when questioned about sensitive issues by legislators or
reporters.
   That anger flared last week when he blamed Lucas' defeat on
``raw politics'' and later accused the Judiciary Committee of
blocking the nominee for failing a ``litmus test'' on civil rights
issues.
   Thornburgh denies his political standing was hurt by the losing
bouts with Democrats over Lucas for the civil rights post, and,
earlier, with Republicans over Robert B. Fiske Jr. to be deputy
attorney general.
   Democrats questioned the qualifications of Lucas, a black
Detroit Republican who has never tried court case but was once
sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne County, Mich.
   Fiske, a prominent Wall Street lawyer with strong legal
credentials, ran afoul of conservative Republicans because of his
role in screening President Reagan's judicial nominees for the
American Bar Association.
   After his public anger cooled, Thornburgh waxed a bit
philosophical about Lucas' defeat last week on a pair of 7-7 votes
by the Judiciary Committee.
   ``I've been in this business a long time. There are some efforts
that are worth fighting for,'' Thornburgh said. ``It's worth the
effort and the criticism that comes from trying to attract good
people to serve in government.''
   But as he prepares to celebrate the first anniversary of his
swearing in this week, Thornburgh is still searching for people to
fill the two important positions at the Justice Department.
   Thornburgh also is also skirmishing with Congress over his plans
to close the department's 14 organized-crime strike forces and
merge them with local U.S. attorney's offices and may be heading
for a confrontation by claiming a right to ignore congressional
objections to his plans to reorganize the department.
   The Lucas battle has raised some questions about Thornburgh's
ability to operate on Capitol Hill, spokesman David Runkel
dismissed any suggestion Thornburgh and his aides misread the
situation.
   ``Our people had every expectation that even on a tie vote, the
committee would send the name forward to the Senate,'' he said. ``I
don't think there was any way for us to predict'' the outcome until
an eleventh-hour Democratic caucus. ``It's clear that they made the
decision late to play hardball.''
   After rejecting a motion to recommend Lucas on a 7-7 tie, the
committee also defeated on the same vote an attempt to report the
nomination to the floor for further action.
   ``This is a journey, you have some things you win, some things
you lose,'' Runkel said. ``The things you lose you learn by them.''
   The Lucas vote last Tuesday came barely a month after Fiske
withdrew from consideration for the Justice Department's No. 2 spot.
   Senate Republicans including Strom Thurmond of South Carolina
and Gordon Humphrey objected to Fiske, saying that as chairman of
the ABA's judicial screening panel he had scuttled some of Reagan's
nominees to the federal bench.
   Thornburgh tried to allay the conservatives' suspicions about
Fiske last spring, telling Congress Fiske had help negotiate an
agreement whereby the ABA consented not to evaluate a judicial
candidate's political or ideological views.
   But Thornburgh's announcement blew up in his face hours later
when the ABA said there was no such agreement.
   An angry Thornburgh then threatened to cut the ABA out of all
judicial screening unless his terms were accepted.
   The ABA and Thornburgh came to terms after a one-month delay,
but that gave Fiske's opponents more time to raise doubts about the
appointment and Fisk bowed out in early July.
   ``Something you learn is timing,'' a lesson that can be applied
to the Lucas case as well as the Fiske episode, Runkel said.
   ``I don't think anybody doubts Lucas would have been confirmed
if the Senate had voted on him prior to all the recent Supreme
Court decisions,'' Runkel said.
   Lucas defended the series of high court rulings on civil rights
that are unpopular with liberal Democrats, echoing the Bush
administration policy that no legislation is needed to overturn
them.
   Lucas's answers disturbed several Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, prompting Thornburgh later to accuse the panel of
applying too narrow a test on civil rights issues.
   ``I find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an
important area of the law,'' Thornburgh told reporters last week.
   Runkel maintained that both Lucas and Fiske were victims of the
``politicization of the confirmation process.''
   Democrats argued that the issue with Lucas was not politics, but
qualifications.
   Despite that judgment, Runkel insists Lucas is a ``solid guy''
who ``will have a position in the administration'' if he wants it.
   The same day Thornburgh lost the bitter fight with civil rights
groups over Lucas, the attorney general helped negotiate compromise
legislation to end discrimination against the nation's 43 million
Americans with disabilities.
   Civil rights lobbyist Ralph Neas, who fought the attorney
general on Lucas, said Thornburgh played a ``very pivotal role
behind the scenes'' forging the compromise.
   ``One of the more fascinating aspect of politics is that today's
adversary can be tomorrow's ally,'' Neas said. ``In this case it
was that today's adversary can be today's ally.''

<HEAD>Congress Hands Bush Victory on First Major Legislative Initiative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress ended a bitter, two-day parliamentary
standoff early Saturday by adopting a $159 billion rescue of the
savings and loan industry, handing President Bush a victory on his
first major legislative initiative.
   The bill, described as the most important financial law enacted
since the Depression, provides money to close or merge an estimated
500 insolvent thrift institutions and to pay government obligations
incurred in the rescue of 223 S&amp;Ls last year.
   The administration estimates the cost, including interest
payments on bonds issued to finance the bailout, at $159 billion
through 1999. At least half the money will be spent in Texas, where
a combination of lax regulatory oversight and an economic downturn
sent the industry's losses soaring.
   Much of the rest goes to other oil-producing states such as
Oklahoma and Louisiana, and to California and Florida where thrifts
were permitted to enter businesses far removed from traditional
home mortgage lending.
   ``It is without doubt the single biggest bill in the history of
this country,'' said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking GOP member
of the Senate Banking Committee.
   In a series of what Bush calls ``never again'' provisions, the
legislation overhauls the regulatory bureaucracy, imposes stringent
financial and accounting standards on S&amp;Ls and quadruples the
maximum jail term for defrauding a financial institution.
   Analysts say the law will touch the lives of everyone who pays
taxes, owns real estate or deposits their money in a thrift
institution or bank.
   The shutdown of sick thrifts paying high interest rates likely
will lower rates to all savers because healthy S&amp;Ls and banks have
raised theirs to compete for deposits, economists believe.
   When the government moves to sell an estimated $300 billion in
real estate inherited from failed S&amp;Ls, the glut of properties
could depress prices in already fragile markets, primarily in the
Southwest.
   Many lawmakers, sensitive to the public perception that they in
effect are giving taxpayer dollars to crooks and con artists, said
the bailout was the only way to protect millions of depositors
whose accounts are federally insured up to $100,000.
   ``We are not bailing out S&amp;Ls, we are not bailing out their
owners or stockholders. We are standing behind our promise to
protect the savers of America,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,
the senior Republican on the House Banking Committee.
   Legislators, nevertheless, were reluctant to vote for the
measure. But, about five minutes after midnight, the bill passed
the House by a 201-175 vote. The Senate had approved it less than
two hours earlier in an unusual procedure that avoided a record of
which members voted for and which against.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
banking panel, said the rare ``division'' vote, in which senators
stand to cast their ballot, was used as part of informal
arrangement that unsnarled a parliamentary tangle involving
unrelated measures. Riegle said the bill would have passed with
about 70 votes had a roll call been taken.
   The S&amp;L bill, which runs to nearly 1,000 pages, is the first
major piece of legislation initiated by Bush. Only two weeks after
taking office, the president called on Congress to act in 45 days
to stem a financial emergency inherited from the Reagan
administration. It took Congress six months, but lawmakers gave
Bush substantially what he wanted.
   The crisis had been building for years, but was little discussed
in government outside of regulatory agencies and Congress' banking
committees. Bush, and his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis,
virtually ignored the issue during the 1988 election campaign.
   The final dispute holding up passage had little to do with the
S&amp;L problem and much to do with the political struggle between
Congress and the administration over balancing the federal budget
deficit.
   Bush wanted to finance $50 billion of the program through a new,
quasi-private agency, thus keeping S&amp;L spending from ballooning the
federal budget deficit, which in turn would trigger automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   Democrats, trying to pressure Bush into reneging on his ``no new
taxes'' pledge, wanted to embarrass the administration with
climbing annual deficits. They would have avoided the spending cuts
by simply waiving Gramm-Rudman.
   The White House claimed that would have set a precedent opening
the way for a congressional spending spree on other projects.
Democrats said their plan saves billions of dollars in interest
costs because the government would borrow bailout money with
regular Treasury debt.
   On Thursday morning, Bush threatened to veto the S&amp;L bill unless
it included his funding plan. Shrugging off the threat, the House
voted 221-199 to adopt the Democratic proposal. The Senate,
however, fell six votes short of the 60 needed to waive
Gramm-Rudman and sent the legislation back to a conference between
the two chambers.
   With the participation of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman, congressional negotiators
worked out a compromise late Thursday night.
   Twenty billion dollars will be raised this year under the
Democratic plan, inflating the deficit to about $168 billion, the
highest in three years. The remaining $30 billion will be raised
under the president's scheme, keeping the spending out of the
deficit in 1990 and 1991.
   On Friday, opposition to the pact from two influential House
chairmen, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the Ways and Means
Committee, and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., of the Budget
Committee, jeopardized final passage.
   ``There is a time to fold and there is a time to be bold,''
Rostenkowski said, urging Democrats hold out for their plan through
the early morning hours.
   But he and other speakers were interrupted with periodic shouts
of ``Vote! Vote!'' from members anxious to follow their 51
colleagues who had already gone home.
   In the end, the lure of summer vacation proved more powerful.
Enough Democrats folded to allow Republicans to pass the compromise.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad got a full six
hours sleep Wednesday night for the first time in five days.
   His waking hours were spent in a frenetic race from television
studios to the halls of Congress, from radio booths to White House
offices. Such was Arad's visibility that one senior White House
official suggested he switch jobs and become a media star.
   ``We mounted a paramount information campaign,'' said the
soft-spoken envoy who has represented his country in Washington for
the past two years, which have been some of the most turbulent in
the 40-year-old relationship between the two allies.
   By satellite from Jerusalem, telefax machines in Washington and
airwaves around the United States, Israeli officials sought to
deflect accusations _ made privately by some administration
officials and publicly by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole _ that
Israel's kidnapping of a Lebanese cleric was a cavalier act that
endangered American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``We acted in a coordinated fashion, in a widesweeping and
intensive way. We were all mobilized in this campaign,'' Arad said.
   The Israelis swung into action on Monday, hours after a group
calling itself The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth released
a videotape purporting to show the hanged body of kidnapped Marine,
Lt. Col. William Higgins. The Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group
said Higgins was killed in retaliation for Israel's July 28
kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   Arad appeared on two prime-time television news shows that
evening, followed by Israeli Arab Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert from
Jerusalem on ABC TV's ``Nightline'' program. Arad was up early
Tuesday for a 7 a.m. National Public Radio program. Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens followed minutes later from Jerusalem,
appearing on ABC's ``Good Morning America.``
   At the embassy, meanwhile, secretaries were faxing to members of
Congress and the media a list of terrorist acts, including car
bombings and infiltration attempts into Israel, allegedly planned
by Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid in his capacity as a leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Arens said Obeid was directly responsible for the Higgins'
kidnapping in Lebanon 17 months ago, and may also have been
responsible for his death. ``I think in retrospect we will see that
we struck a very effective blow against terrorism,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, reactions started coming in. The embassy said it
received 135 calls, of which 124 praised Israel for its tough
stance against terrorism. A handful were hate calls, said one
staffer.
   Arad worked the phones, too, calling dozens of lawmakers to
explain Israel's position and elicit their views. Dole and several
House members publicly criticized Israel for reckless behavior and
for failing to consult the United States. Arad conceded that other
lawmakers and officials held similar views.
   ``It was important to nip that in the bud,'' he said. ``The
administration initially appeared undecided'' about whether Israel
should or shouldn't be blamed, he said.
   Indeed, while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was careful
on Monday not to criticize Israel's actions, he also told reporters
that, ``It is fair to say that many people do share the senator's
(Dole's) concern.''
   By Wednesday, ``people were talking about what the United States
should do to save the hostages, not who it should blame,'' Arad
said.
   Israel, a nation of 4.3 million isolated among hostile Arab
nations, is highly sensitive to its image abroad. It long enjoyed
virtual blanket approval from the U.S. government and the American
public, but both have adopted a more questioning attitude in recent
years.
   Crises in relations with its main financial backer and
diplomatic ally highlight Israelis' feelings that the world ignores
the Arab threat to their security and treats them according to a
double standard.
   ``Israel is in a war, fighting against an enemy that doesn't
play by the norms and rules that the West shares. Put otherwise,
you can't wear kid gloves in a brass knuckle neighborhood,'' said
Harry Wall, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
in Israel.
   By Thursday, Israel had placed a whole new construction on its
kidnapping of Obeid.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the issue of the 16 American
and European hostages held in Lebanon by shadowy Shiite Moslem
groups had been ``swept under the rug'' for a long time, until
Israel revived it with the Obeid abduction.
   Rabin said he hoped Israel's action would not only ``capture the
headlines,'' but also bring about the captives' freedom.

   Congress early Saturday voted final passage of
a landmark savings and loan bill described as the most significant
piece of financial legislation in 50 years. Here are the highlights
of the bill:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   According to the latest Bush administration estimate, the
bailout will cost $159 billion through 1999. That includes $60.5
billion to meet government obligations incurred in the rescue of
223 S&amp;Ls in 1988, $74.2 billion to close or merge more than 500
additional S&amp;Ls and $24.4 billion for the government's share of
interest on bonds sold to help pay for the bailout. Congress'
General Accounting Office estimates the cost, with interest over 30
years, at $285 billion. Of that, $157 billion will come from the
taxpayers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the most important reform in the bill, S&amp;L owners, 120 days
after enactment, will be required to invest more of their own
capital in their institutions. The provision, aimed at discouraging
risky investments, requires owners to back every $100 they lend
with $1.50 in tangible capital. By 1995, the standard will be $3.
Many of the accounting loopholes that allowed S&amp;L owners to avoid
capital requirements have been closed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INSURANCE PREMIUMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both S&amp;Ls and commercial banks will pay more for the government
deposit insurance that protects savers' accounts up to $100,000.
Bank premiums will jump from 8 cents per $100 to 15 cents. S&amp;L
premiums will rise from 20.8 cents to 23 cents. Analysts believe
some of the expense will be passed on to savers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCIAL STANDARDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The bill pushes S&amp;Ls back into home mortgage lending and out of
risky investments such as speculative commercial real estate
projects and junk bonds. Thrift institutions are required to raise
the level of housing and housing-related loans in their portfolios
to 70 percent, up from the current 60 percent requirement. S&amp;Ls
currently involved in risky ventures will have five years to phase
out their investments. After that, they can invest in those areas
only through separately capitalized affiliates that involve no risk
to insured deposits.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUREAUCRACY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The lead S&amp;L regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, is being dismantled. Its regulatory divisions will be
transferred to a new agency within the Treasury Department. The
fund insuring S&amp;L deposits moves to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which already insures commercial banks. The 12 regional
Federal Home Loan Banks, which are owned by the industry, remain
independent. They will lose their regulatory power but continue to
provide low-cost financing to S&amp;Ls.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOUSING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The industry-owned regional Federal Home Loan Banks will be
required to earmark $50 million a year, increasing to $100 million,
to help finance housing for poor people.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTI-DISCRIMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Banks and S&amp;Ls will have to disclose reports from federal
regulators evaluating how well they serve poor and minority
neighborhoods. Mortgage lenders will be required to collect and
disclose data on the race, sex and income level of customers and
loan applicants.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAL ESTATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A new agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., will be created to
sell more than $300 billion in real estate now owned by bankrupt
S&amp;Ls. The FDIC will do the work, overseen by a board headed by the
treasury secretary. The government will be required to give housing
authorities and non-profit agencies first chance to buy housing
from the S&amp;Ls. Some fear the massive property sales will further
damage real estate markets in already-depressed oil-producing
regions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTI-FRAUD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is getting $75 million a year for the
next three years to uncover and prosecute fraud at both S&amp;Ls and
banks. It is directed to establish a special fraud task force in
Texas, where most S&amp;L problems are centered. Maximum fines for
financial institution fraud are being raised from $5,000 a day to
$1 million and the maximum jail term from five years to 20 years.

   The Soviet Union on Saturday portrayed a gloomy
picture of an economy sliding toward disaster with a national debt
of nearly $500 billion and growing faster than that of the United
States.
   The revelation was made in a speech by State Planning Committee
Chairman Yuri Maslyukov to the Supreme Soviet, or legislature.
   Despite the dismal prognosis, Maslyukov's speech was markedly
different from previous statements by Soviet economic authorities
in that he acknowledged some key problems and outlined ways to
solve them.
   The proposals likely will be taken up by the Supreme Soviet when
it considers the 1990 budget in a session that begins Sept. 25.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, speaking in the United
States last week, reported the latest sad joke: The difference
between an optimist and a pessimist, he said, depends on whether a
person expects economic disaster to strike the Soviet Union in one,
two or five years.
   Soviet stores are expected to become even more barren because
wages now are rising twice as fast as the production of consumer
goods, according to Maslyukov's figures. Imports alone are not the
answer, he said.
   ``No foreign uncle is going to solve this problem for us,'' he
warned.
   Inflationary pressures are growing, and the deficit for 1989 is
now projected at $192 billion, up 20 percent from estimates given
six months ago.
   That is four times more than the U.S. budget deficit in terms of
the economy's ability to adjust to it. The Soviet deficit amounts
to 13.8 percent of all the country's goods and services produced in
a year.
   In November, Finance Minister Boris Gostev made world headlines
by admitting to a budget deficit for the first time, but his figure
hid two-thirds of the deficit with bookkeeping tricks.
   In his speech, made Friday and reported Saturday by Pravda,
Maslyukov called for an end to such smoke screens. He proposed
issuing government bonds to cover the deficit and paying interest
to savers.
   That would sop up some of the public's extra cash, which it is
now trying to spend on inadequate supplies of consumer goods,
Maslyukov said.
   ``We must stop the worsening of the economic situation and
social tension,'' he said. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet miners
went on strike in July, in part because of shortages of housing and
simple goods like soap and meat.
   In 1990, the government plans for consumer goods production to
grow 11 times faster than heavy industry, he said. Already this
year, government investment in factories and machinery has dropped
by 30 percent, he said.
   That would be a dramatic turnaround for the Soviet government,
which has traditionally emphasized heavy industry and defense at
the expense of housing and consumer goods.
   But even Maslyukov's promised doubling and tripling of the
growth rates for manufacturing of televisions and washing machines
will meet just a tiny fraction of the demand.
   For example, the growth rate for television manufacturing will
triple _ bringing total production to 10.6 million sets a year for
a population of 287 million.
   Maslyukov said the deficit could be cut in half next year by
reducing the losses at state enterprises and trimming defense
spending and government investment in industry.

   Coal miners in the far northern Vorkuta region
walked off their jobs Saturday but then agreed that government
concessions are generous enough to keep them at work at least until
next year, official reports said.
   The Tass news agency said thousands of miners shut down 11 of 13
mines in the coal-rich Pechora field north of the Arctic Circle but
agreed to start working again at midnight after officials explained
concessions included in a government decree.
   ``At a joint conference, representatives of mines and
enterprises of the town unanimously decided to stop the strike
until Jan. 1, 1990, and to start working from midnight,'' state TV
reported. It did not say what would happen after the first of the
year.
   Workers decided Friday to stay off the job until they received
the full text of a government decree that officials say fulfills
promises made to end a wave of strikes last month.
   The promises included bonuses for night work and for miners who
use dangerous equipment, and better pension and overtime benefits.
The government also made general pledges to improve housing and end
shortages of food and consumer goods.
   A spokesman at the Organizational Department of the local
Communist Party headquarters said in a telephone interview that
Alexander Tsuryupa, a director of the state enterprise that
operates all 13 mines, brought a copy of the decree from Moscow,
1,100 miles to the southwest, and explained it to the workers
Saturday.
   The miners then held a closed meeting to decide whether to go
back to work, said the official, who declined to identify himself.
   ``Emotions have stabilized and now there are no outbursts,'' he
said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called last month's
strikes by hundreds of thousands of coal miners the greatest trial
of his 4{ years in power. He sympathized with the workers but urged
them to return to their jobs.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the official media Friday that
the settlement with the miners would cost about $3.2 billion.
   He said it would be difficult for the government to come up with
the money and told other workers that if they strike they will hurt
only themselves.
   ``If we follow the road of strikes, no one will benefit from it
and low-paid sections of the population will be hit first,'' he
said in a television interview.
   The Vorkuta miners first struck July 19, several days after
thousands of miners in other parts of the Soviet Union already had
walked out. They demanded better living and working conditions and
that the government pay more attention to the problems of workers
in the far north. They returned to work after about a week.
   Workers in the Kuzbass area of Siberia, where the strikes began,
conducted a two-hour warning strike Thursday because they said the
government is not living up to its promise to shut down a
hydroelectric project the miners say is damaging the environment.

   The pain won't end for Thomas Cicippio until
his brother Joseph and all the other hostages in Lebanon come home.
   But even after an agonizing week in which his brother was under
a death sentence by his Moslem captors for several days, Cicippio
is certain the hostages will be freed one day.
   ``I think if the U.S. and all of the other governments would
stick together now, I'm sure they'll be able to end the hostage
situation,'' Thomas Cicippio said Friday from Norristown.
   He said his family planned to spend the weekend trying to get
their lives back on an even keel after a week in which another U.S.
hostage was reported hanged, four deadlines for Joseph's death were
set and then canceled, his wife made an extraordinary plea for her
husband's safety, and Joseph appealed in a videotape for the
release of a Lebanese clergyman seized by Israel last month.
   ``Life must go on,'' Thomas Cicippio said. ``Of course, we
always think about Joseph. There's no way you can do anything
without thinking about Joe.''
   Joseph Cicippio was on his way to work as acting comptroller of
the American University in Beirut when he was kidnapped Sept. 12,
1986.
   On Monday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization said it would
kill him if Israel did not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Shiite
Moslem spiritual leader Israeli commandos captured in Lebanon on
July 28.
   The threat to Cicippio came shortly after another pro-Iranian
group claimed it had hanged Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in
retaliation for Israel's action. A videotape that seemed to show
the body of Higgins hanging from a noose was issued, but no body
has been found and some reports have said he was killed months ago.
   Elham Ghandour Cicippio, whom Joseph married in 1985, pleaded
Tuesday for the captors to ``review their consciences and stop from
carrying out'' the killing.
   The captors' first deadline, 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday, was pushed
back four hours and then until Thursday. The captors said they were
responding to ``friendly appeals'' and the plea from Mrs. Cicippio.
   By Thursday, when the new deadline approached, scores of
journalists were trampling the lawn outside Thomas Cicippio's
suburban split-level home. Early in the day, it was extended three
hours, and a videotaped message with Joseph Cicippio urging Obeid's
release was made public in Beirut.
   Just before 2 p.m., the captors said they had called off the
killing and replaced it with demands that Israel free Palestinian
and Lebanese prisoners. They said they would provide a list to the
Red Cross.
   The news made the Cicippio family jubilant. ``We were all so
extremely happy,'' Thomas Cicippio said. ``It was just a case of
joy and tears and kisses and hugs and everything else.''
   But he stressed that the family's ordeal won't end even if his
brother is freed.
   ``What it would really take is not only to have Joseph knock on
my front door, but to have all of the hostages be able to go home
and knock on their own front door,'' he said. ``We can't forget the
rest of the hostages. They're all a part of us now.''
   ``Most of all I'd like to see Lt. Col. Higgins come back and be
able to knock on his front door,'' Cicippio said. ``I have a
feeling that the colonel is still alive.''
   Not counting Higgins, 16 Westerners including eight Americans
are believed to be held captive in Lebanon. Held longest is Terry
A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.
   Cicippio said he felt no rancor toward his brother's captors.
   ``Joseph is still alive,'' he said. ``If he wasn't alive, it may
be a different story. All of the other American hostages, as far as
I know, are still alive. So there's no way I can say I hate them.''
   And Cicippio said he didn't mind what the journalists had done
to his lawn.
   ``Perhaps they can all come back tomorrow and retrample it,'' he
said. ``I don't care if we have twice as many people come, that is
if we get word that Joseph is free.''

<HEAD>Algeria: Skilled Broker in Hostage Crises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Moslem Arab country has combined
strong revolutionary credentials, good Western contacts, and deft
diplomacy to forge a reputation as a successful mediator of hostage
crises.
   It counts among its negotiating coups the release in January
1981 of Americans who were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran.
   This North African country's envoys are once again playing the
role of mediator: this time in the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
   Algeria is no stranger to that country's turmoil. Though
Algeria's exact role never has been spelled out, French officials
thanked the nation publicly after French hostages were released by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon in 1987-1988.
   ``We have a skill that we put at the disposal of the
international community,'' the Algerian ambassador to Washington,
Mohammed Sahnoun, told reporters in April 1988. He spoke after
Shiite Moslem hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner gave up the plane in
Algeria and were apparently allowed to escape.
   Sahnoun said he could not provide details of the agreement
because it would break Algeria's word to the hijackers and damage
its chances of helping in such situations in the future.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and former Secretary
of State George Shultz criticized the decision to release the
Kuwaiti hijackers, who killed two passengers.
   In response, Algeria rejected what it called an effort ``to
fling discredit on an action which saved precious human lives from
murderous violence.''
   Perhaps the most prominent Algerian success came Jan. 20, 1981,
when American hostages held 444 days in Tehran stepped off an
airliner at the Algiers airport.
   Iran and the United States had cut a deal _ after months of
mediation by Algerian diplomats.
   ``A happy ending might change the American view that we are
communists,'' a senior Algerian official said at the time.
   After a war with France that led to independence in 1962,
Algeria pursued socialist policies and shaped close ties with the
Soviet Union and radical Moslem groups.
   While Algeria is often in clear sympathy with the aims of
radical organizations, it has steered clear of supporting terrorist
tactics.
   In October 1977, Algerian officials negotiated at the foot of a
Japanese DC-8 hijacked by guerrillas from a group known as the Red
Army. The Algerians helped win freedom for hostages in exchange for
a $6 million ransom and the release of six of the militants'
comrades in Japanese jails.
   In this case, the hijackers also were apparently allowed to
leave Algeria.

   The pro-Iranian extremist group Hezbollah
on Saturday named five Palestinians and Lebanese whom it said
Israel should release along with an abducted Moslem cleric.
   Hezbollah also denied holding any negotiations on a possible
prisoner exchange with Israel.
   The Shiite Moslem organization was reacting to Israel's July 28
abduction from Lebanon of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. Israel has said
it will trade the cleric, whom it links to terrorism, and up to 60
other Shiites for three Israeli prisoners and the 17 foreigners
held in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah said the abduction of Obeid has ``blocked chances for
a swap,'' but it also said Israel should ``free Sheik Obeid first.''
   One Shiite group in Lebanon claimed it killed a U.S. Marine it
held hostage in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. A second group
threatened to kill another American but later said it had issued a
reprieve.
   Hezbollah's statement came the same day a ranking Maronite
Catholic bishop crossed into Beirut's Moslem sector to meet with
Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
Bishop Khalil Abi-Nadir told reporters he carried a message from
Pope John Paul II asking that the body of the Marine, Lt. Col.
William Higgins, be returned to his family.
   Hezbollah has demanded that Israel release the cleric, in
addition to Palestinians jailed during the anti-Israeli uprising in
the occupied lands and captured guerrillas.
   The statement issued Saturday listed the five detainees as the
``uprising heroes'' Nidal Zaloum, Itaf Alyan and Abdul-Hadi
Suleiman Ghanem and the ``Lebanese resistance heroes'' Anwar Yaseen
and Soha Bishara.
   It quoted an unidentified ``responsible source'' in Hezbollah as
saying: ``We are as eager to obtain (their) release as much as we
are eager to obtain the release of the detainees who belong to the
sons of Hezbollah.''
   Zaloum stabbed two Israelis to death in Jerusalem, and Ghanem
carried out an attack on a bus. Ms. Alyan was arrested before she
could carry out a bombing in August 1987.
   Yaseen was arrested and accused of preparing an attack on
Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   Ms. Bishara shot and wounded Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander
of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, on Nov. 7 in
south Lebanon.
   Despite public disclaimers, Hezbollah is widely believed to be
the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding most of the 16
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah said lists of other prisoners it wants released will
be prepared within days and presented to the Red Cross.
   The chief delegate of the International Committee of the Red
Cross in Lebanon, Michel Dufour, told The Associated Press on
Saturday that his group had not been approached.

   A scholarship fund started for Lt. Col.
William Higgins' daughter has gotten an unexpectedly widespread
response, with $10,000 in pledges, organizers said.
   ``The people who can't afford to give are giving,'' said Pat
Mullen, a lawyer who served with Higgins in the Marines in the late
'60s. ``The most important ones are the $5 and $10 contributors,
who are not Marines.''
   Higgins, 44, was in Lebanon serving as part of an international
peacekeeping force when he was taken hostage in February 1988.
   On Monday, his captors released a videotape that seemed to show
Higgins hanging from a noose, saying he had been killed in
retaliation for the Israelis' seizure the previous week of a Shiite
Moslem cleric. U.S. officials have speculated that Higgins actually
was killed some time earlier.
   Mullen and Dallas businessman Schuyler Page, another former
Marine, originally intended to gather enough money to assist
Higgins' 19-year-old daughter, Christine, a student at James
Madison University in Virginia.
   But Mullen said Friday that the total had already hit $10,000
and may grow large enough to set up an endowment to help other
dependents of people killed during military service.
   ``With the public response, I don't think it's inconceivable
that we can raise over $100,000, which will allow us to do more in
Colonel Higgins' name,'' he said.
   Page and Mullen were classmates with Higgins in an officer
training course. and after it ended in November 1967, they served
in Vietnam.
   Defense Department spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said people who
know Higgins continue to hope that he is not dead. She said Miss
Higgins learned of the scholarship fund Friday and was touched by
the effort.

   More than 100,000 people were marooned,
many on roofs, after rivers burst their embankments and caused
floods that killed at least 150 people in the last two weeks,
officials and news reports said Saturday.
   The torrential rains ended Thursday, and officials said river
embankments had burst at 17 places, washing away mud-and-straw
houses in at least 100 villages. They said floods had affected some
250,000 people.
   The area most severely hit was the tea-growing Zakiganj area in
Sylhet district, 120 miles northeast of Dhaka, a Relief Ministry
official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least
10 people died of diarrhea in Zakiganj in the last three days. At
least 1,000 others were affected by the disease caused by dirty
drinking water, he said.
   News reports reaching Dhaka said at least 150 people died in the
Zakiganj area as a result of the rains in the past two weeks.
   The government has sent 12 medical teams to Zakiganj.
   ``The situation is quite alarming. We are trying our best to
evacuate the marooned people, but we don't have enough
speedboats,'' said an official who visited the area Friday.
   Many people were stranded on roofs with floodwaters around them,
and some had built makeshift bamboo platforms, he said.
   ``Many people have grain, but they have no dry place to cook,''
he said.
   The Flood Forecasting Center said water was receding in the
Kushiara River in Zakiganj but was still above the danger level.
   Flooding is an annual problem in this impoverished nation of 110
million. More than 1,400 people were killed last year in floods
that submerged three-fourths of the country.

   For a few moments, a Beverly Hills
fund-raising dinner looked like the good old days before Mayor Tom
Bradley's fifth term turned into a tangle of investigations that
cut into his reputation of integrity.
   As Bradley took the podium last week in a hotel ballroom, 800
organized labor activists stood and applauded. Pocket cameras
flashed. Busboys turned from clearing tables to catch a look at the
mayor.
   The 71-year-old Bradley was in characteristic form, tall and
athletic like the UCLA track star he used to be, his voice deep and
monotone as he delivered a speech praising organized labor.
   The mayor gave no clue of the problems dogging the fifth term he
won in April _ the allegations of conflict of interest and
influence peddling, accusations of coverup and speculation that he
may resign.
   City Attorney James Hahn is probing, among other things, the
mayor's ties to two financial institutions that paid Bradley while
doing business with the city.
   Bradley, who denies any wrongdoing, said Friday he has
established an account for supporter contributions to cover his
legal expenses.
   Hahn's probe, expected to be completed by mid-September, hangs
over City Hall.
   ``All conversations begin with a discussion of this. It's the
first thing people say as they shake your hand,'' said Joy Picus, a
member of the City Council.
   Shortly before the election, newspaper reports said the city
treasurer directed the deposit of $2 million in a bank paying
$18,000 to the mayor to act as adviser.
   The deposit was made in Far East National Bank on the day the
mayor called Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg, and one day after the
mayor spoke with the bank president about the city's failure to
renew a $1 million certificate of deposit.
   Rittenberg denied the mayor influenced him and the mayor denied
any wrongdoing. Bradley returned the $18,000, and made it through
the election, barely avoiding a runoff.
   But questions persisted.
   An official in the treasurer's office testified before a City
Council committee that his two bosses, including Rittenberg, tried
to cover up the mayor's role in the Far East deposit, an allegation
Rittenberg denies.
   The official, George Sehlmeyer, said a city form was doctored so
that the notation ``per the mayor'' next to the Far East deposit
record was covered with correction fluid.
   ``I was stunned to hear the mayor was even involved,'' said
Sehlmeyer.
   Other probes of Bradley include:
   _ A city-funded Africa task force whose executive director,
Juanita St. John, is involved in a lucrative real estate deal with
the mayor.
   Ms. St. John has been charged with misdemeanor failure to comply
with a subpoena after refusing to turn over documents on $180,000
in task force checks written to herself, or for ``cash.''
   _ The Justice Department is looking into whether investment
banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert gave the mayor favorable
treatment in stock deals in exchange for favored treatment by the
city.
   _ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing
whether Bradley's stock and bond trades were tainted by insider
trading.
   Walter Zelman, executive director of the political watchdog
group Common Cause, said that Bradley's acceptance of money from
Far East was ``pretty unusual and pretty blatant and a really
serious mistake.''
   The mayor also was hired by Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan to act
as adviser while that institution was doing business with the city.
   If Bradley did use his influence to direct city dollars to the
institutions, he could face criminal charges, said Zelman.
   But until the city attorney completes his investigation, many
city officials and business leaders refuse to speculate about the
mayor.
   ``Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing,'' said Councilman Nate
Holden, who opposed Bradley in the last election. ``You don't jump
up and down on a guy just because he's been accused.''
   But even the mayor's supporters said they have found it hard to
believe he would work for a bank that was doing business with the
city.
   ``In all the years I've known him, I've never known him before
these matters came up to be anything but completely honest and
forthright,'' said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. ``In that way
it's a surprise that he would even allow these things to happen.''

   TV executives are standing behind
photographers who got into a confrontation with security people
when they defied Bob Dylan's policy of banning cameras at his
concerts.
   Dylan thinks it is unfair that paying customers might have their
views blocked by photographers on free passes, the singer's
representative, Eliot Mintz, said from Los Angeles Friday.
   When press photographers shot a concert Thursday after being
notified they couldn't, security guards and concert promoters tried
to confiscate videotape from one television station, attempted to
interrupt a live broadcast of another, and refused to admit a
photographer from the Star Tribune.
   A St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch photographer who arrived early
shot the event without incident. But KARE-TV complained that its
photographer had to flee to the station's van to keep tape from
being seized.
   ``Our basic position is that this was a news story, so it falls
under fair use,'' said Janet Mason, KARE's vice president of news.

   Iran said Saturday it has refused to
accept a message from President Bush about the foreign hostages in
Lebanon, but a U.N. spokesman working on the issue talked of
``optimism in the air.''
   In Washington, a government source said the Bush administration
had succeeded in communicating with Iran, which is believed to have
strong influence over groups holding hostages.
   Algeria assumed a leading role in efforts to win release of the
captives.
   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for
factions holding hostages, named five prisoners held in Israel that
it wants released, in addition to a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped
by Israel.
   The statement indirectly endorsed demands made Thursday by the
Revolutionary Justice Organization after it suspended threats to
kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   Israel said it was exploring all ways of winning freedom for
hostages but would not engage in ``public debate'' on the demands.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an
unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying: ``The U.S.
administration sent a message to Iran's Foreign Ministry last week
through a third country. Since the content had nothing to do with
Iran, the message was not accepted.''
   Iran has denied involvement in hostage-taking.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the official was
responding to reports that Bush sent a message to Iran to prevent
the killing of hostages. It gave no further details.
   A closely involved source in Washington said on condition of
anonymity, ``Basically, we've been trying to get different people
to weigh in.''
   ``We have been able to get our messages, one way or another,
through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians,'' the source
said.
   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, on Friday offered to
help solve the hostage problem.
   However, he said the United States must pressure Israel to free
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman abducted July 28
from south Lebanon.
   On Monday, a pro-Iranian group said it hanged an American
hostage, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation for
Israel's refusal to free Obeid. Revolutionary Justice then
threatened to kill Cicippio but said Thursday it was ``freezing''
the order while demanding freedom for Obeid and Palestinian and
Lebanese prisoners in Israel.
   Israel has accused Obeid of instigating attacks on Israel and
has offered to free him only if the foreign hostages and three
Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon are freed.
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top aide, Yossi
Ahimeir, said Israel's original offer stands and that the country
refuses to ``engage in a public debate'' over Hezbollah demands.
   ``We are holding contacts and making efforts to bring about the
release of hostages and prisoners and it's not worthwhile to add
any details now,'' he said.
   There are 16 foreigners, including eight Americans, held in
Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   In Damascus, Syria, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations,
Marrack Goulding, told a news conference there was ``optimism in
the air'' in Beirut about the release of hostages.
   But he warned there would be no ``quick fixes, no simple
solution.''
   Goulding arrived in Syria from Lebanon, where he was
investigating the killing of Higgins, who was working with a U.N.
observer force when he was abducted in February 1988.
   After three days of discussions in Beirut, Goulding said he had
not yet ``obtained concrete proof that Colonel Higgins is dead, and
I pray he is not dead.''
   U.S. officials have said they are virtually certain Higgins is
dead.
   Goulding also told reporters: ``Algeria is playing an extra part
in trying to resolve the hostage problem as Algeria has done in
previous cases.''
   The North African country, which has strong ties to both the
West and radical Moslem groups, has successfully mediated hostage
crises in the past 10 years. Algerian diplomats helped win the
release of American hostages in January 1981 after they were held
444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Iran.
   Algeria's ambassador to Beirut, Khaled Hasnawi, was quoted
Saturday by Beirut radio stations as saying his country was
undertaking a new initiative to free all hostages.
   Radio Algiers said his talks involved all hostages, whether
``Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.'' It
cited ``progress in this mediation.''
   Several Beirut radio stations said Bush had specifically asked
Algeria to intercede.
   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut on Saturday demanded
freedom from Israeli prisons of five ``uprising heroes,''
identified as Nidal Zaloum, Itaf Alyan and Abdul-Hadi Suleiman
Ghanem and ``Lebanese resistance heroes'' Anwar Yaseen and Soha
Bishara.
   It also demanded Israel release Obeid, Palestinians jailed
during the anti-Israeli uprising in the occupied territories, and
guerrillas it has captured.

   Syria sent tanks and rocket launchers to
the edge of the city's Christian sector Saturday, indicating it may
be preparing to invade or fend off a Christian assault, police said.
   The artillery movement followed a savage shelling duel on
residential neighborhoods that killed 21 people and wounded 82,
police said. They said 10 of the victims died when mortar shells
hit an underground shelter.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon called it a ``shelling storm.''
Among the dead were seven soldiers serving under Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who also heads the Christian half of
this nation's divided government.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said it was not clear if the Syrian reinforcements ``are a
prelude to storming the Christian sector or facing an invasion by
Aoun's forces.''
   The movement could also be intended as a show of force.
   Both sectors of the city have been buzzing with rumors that
Aoun's forces were planning to storm Moslem west Beirut in an
effort to drive out the Syrians and seize Lebanon's central bank.
It contains the nation's currency reserves.
   Aoun, who sparked the current round of fighting 20 weeks ago by
blockading militia-run ports, has vowed to force the Syrians out of
Lebanon. The Syrians arrived under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, but Aoun says they betrayed that mandate by siding with
Moslem militias in the civil war.
   The spokesman said the tanks, mostly Soviet-designed T-62s,
rolled down the central Lebanese mountains from east Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley, clogging traffic along the Beirut-Damascus highway.
   They took up positions on hills overlooking Christian east
Beirut as well as the three-mile Green Line that splits the city
into Moslem and Christian zones, the spokesman said.
   Dozens of multi-barreled rocket launchers, which fire 40 rockets
a minute, were deployed in several poor neighborhoods along the
Moslem side of the line.
   Earlier Saturday, a six-hour barrage took casualties in Beirut,
the surrounding mountain villages and the Bekaa Valley, according
to the police spokesman.
   A reliable Christian source said seven of those killed in the
shelter, beneath a residential building in the Christian suburb of
Fayadiyeh, were Lebanese army soldiers.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
targeted building was used by Aoun's army as a communications
station. Aoun's command refused comment on the report.
   The shelter was hit by three 240mm mortar shells fired from a
Syrian emplacement in Baaleshmeieh, a few miles east of Fayadiyeh.
   The shells pierced the parking lot of the 10-story building and
blasted the shelter, he said, causing part of the building to
collapse and burying the victims.
   Aoun's command at the Defense Ministry in the suburb of Yarze,
1.5 miles east of Fayadiyeh, sent hundreds of soldiers to evacuate
casualties from the collapsed shelter, the police spokesman said.
   He said casualties were taken away in armored personnel carriers
because ``it was very risky for ambulances to operate due to the
intensity of the barrage.''
   At peak times of the duel, according to the spokesman, 60 shells
per minute were being fired. He said the two sides fired about
10,000 shells and rockets in the exchange.
   By police count, the 20-week-old confrontation between Aoun's
20,000 mainly Christian troops and the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in
Lebanon has killed 537 people and wounded 2,266.
   Moslems are fighting for a greater share of power in Lebanon,
which has been controlled by the Christian minority.
   The latest duel began late Friday and sent civilians fleeing to
basements and underground shelters. It escalated sharply after the
Syrians hit the shelter, the spokesman said.
   Aoun's gunners and their right-wing Christian allies, the
Lebanese Forces militia, entrenched in Lebanon's 310-square-mile
Christian enclave, ``responded heavily,'' the spokesman said.
   Christian militia gunners sprayed residential districts in west
Beirut and other Moslem areas with Grad missiles from rocket
launchers, according to the spokesman.
   He said the 122mm projectiles left gaping holes in apartment
buildings, shattering walls and glass and starting several fires.
   Syrian gunners, manning howitzer emplacements along west
Beirut's seaside boulevard, responded by firing on residential
distriacts in east Beirut.
   The exchanges spread to Moslem Druse and Christian mountains,
south and northeast of the capital.
   Aoun's gunners also shelled the Bekaa Valley town of Chtoura,
which commands the Syrian army's supply routes from Damascus, the
police spokesman said.

   Horse owners are increasing security to
protect against saddle rustlers who cut through fences and locks to
raid stables.
   Since April, more than 110 saddles with an estimated value of
more than $65,000 have been reported stolen from Twin Cities-area
stables and individuals.
   ``They are probably taking them to large horse auctions and
peddling them,'' said Terry Hanson, one of the stable operators
affected.
   Richard Chamberlain, field editor for the Quarter Horse Journal
in Amarillo, Texas, said thieves have been stealing saddles for
years.
   ``A custom built saddle can easily run $2,000,'' he said. ``And
depending on who makes it, it can be two, three times that. You
take a $2,000 saddle and it would not be hard to get $500 for it
real quick.''
   The Minnesota Horse Council is offering a $500 reward for
information on the saddle thieves.

   A glass teepee and newly planted flowers
will greet an expected crowd of 5,000 Monday for a convention of
state legislatures, as Tulsans look forward to the $10 million the
visitors are expected to bring.
   Two cabinet members and the secretary-general of OPEC will be
among dignitaries speaking to delegates at the National Conference
of State Legislatures, which runs through Friday.
   NCSL President Samuel Nunez of Louisiana said the group's agenda
will be very broad to encompass issues significant to all regions
of the country.
   Session topics include health care, education, energy, waste
management and taxes.
   The 15th annual conference also will focus on state responses to
recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions regarding flag burning and
abortion.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown and Lee Atwater, his
Republican counterpart, are scheduled to be on hand Wednesday for
meetings with legislators from their parties.
   Tulsa officials are trying to make a good impression for the
event, which they say will bring an estimated $10 million into the
local economy.
   Workers are busy trimming bushes and placing plants in formerly
barren planters at the city's Civic Center, near the Tulsa
Convention Center where many of the NCSL's sessions will be held.
   Mayor Rodger Randle conscripted inmates and misdemeanor
offenders to help cut weeds on city property and clean downtown.
   ``We are beginning a very intense effort, using whatever labor
we can get, to cut the weeds, especially on the raggedy medians and
where the weeds are sprouting through the pavement cracks,'' Randle
said last week.
   About 1,000 volunteers wearing ``Tulsa teal'' shirts will staff
hospitality booths at 19 Tulsa hotels, said Sharon Bartlett,
coordinator of volunteers.
   An information booth at Tulsa International Airport will be
housed inside a glass tepee.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, and
Samuel Skinner, secretary of transportation, will address delegates
at the conference Tuesday. Former Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Ruckelshaus will speak at a Thursday luncheon.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, will be part of a breakfast panel Tuesday.
Subroto, who uses the single name, will be joined by W. Henson
Moore, deputy energy secretary, and Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., chairman

   Eleven people have died in central
and eastern Yugoslavia in June and July of a viral infection, and
at least 140 other people have been hospitalized because of the
illness, news reports said Saturday.
   The daily Politika Ekspres said three people died in Belgrade
hospitals out of a total of nine diagnosed there as having the
infection. Two people died in the town of Pec in the southern
province of Kosovo, where several were reported afflicted with the
virus known as ``mouse fever.''
   Last month, the national news agency Tanjug reported a total of
six dead and 126 hospitalized in central Yugoslavia from the
disease, which is spread by field mice and other small rodents and
their parasites.
   The symptoms include high fever, back and abdominal pains and
redness of the face and eyes.
   Doctors advised people to wash produce, berries and mushrooms
carefully and take precautions when outdoors.
   Experts have said the mortality rate in patients afflicted with
the disease can be as high as 10 percent. They say there is no
efficient drug or vaccine to treat it.
   Earlier press reports said the first cases this year of the
disease appeared in May in the central republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina. There have been outbreaks of the disease in
Yugoslavia also in 1961, 1967, 1968 and 1986.

<HEAD>Plymouth Rock Beginning to Crack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plymouth Rock, which attracts 1 million
tourists a year, has started to crack open along the same line
where a 1774 split was repaired in 1880.
   Tourists aren't likely to notice the crack but state officials
are worried. They have approached local and state historical groups
to coordinate the preservation of the rock.
   ``It's not a major task, and it's not expensive, but it's just
such a very important landmark we don't want to create any waves,''
said Donald Matinzi, superintendent of Pilgrim Memorial State Park
for the state Department of Environmental Management.
   Waves crashing over the rock on the beach at Plymouth Harbor are
just what have caused the old mortar to erode and the rock to
crack. In the 1880 repair job, the pieces never quite fit and the
cement line was always visible.
   The rock weighs about six tons and is about 14 feet wide and 6
feet long.
   Matinzi's plan involves digging out the sand to expose the total
rock and then adding new mortar to hold the two pieces together.
   ``The poor rock has gotten knocked around so much, and it gets
covered every tide,'' said Carolyn Travers, a research librarian at
Plimoth Plantation, which uses an old spelling of Plymouth. ``If
they don't do something, the froth will get in and split it.''
   Legend, and some historians, have it that the first Pilgrim
landing party used the rock to step ashore in December 1620.
   ``In December, wading is not high on the list of things to do,''
said Laurence Pizer, director of the Pilgrim Society. ``The
interest of the Pilgrims was to find a place to get off at a
relatively high spot and there was no other obvious landing spot
for several hundred feet north or south.''
   The rock's troubles began when the Sons of Liberty decided to
move it to the town square in 1774. The rock was dropped and
broken, so they left two-thirds behind on the beach and moved
one-third to town. But tourists kept chipping away at the smaller
piece, so in 1880 it was taken back where it came from and the two
sections patched together.
   The crack wasn't all bad. At the time it occurred, locals saw
the break as symbolic of the split between the colonies and Great
Britain.

<TEXT>
   George Bush had watched a hostage crisis help
destroy one president and ensnarl another in scandal, so he knew
full well he was plunging into high-risk territory when terrorists
claimed to have killed one American and set an execution date for
another in Lebanon.
   For the first six months of his presidency, Bush had been
largely spared from any pressures over the hostages' plight, even
though nine Americans remained in captivity in Lebanon.
   That suddenly changed after Israeli commandos seized a Shiite
Moslem cleric in Lebanon. Three days later, a shadowy organization
called the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth declared it had
hanged Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and released a videotape
purportedly showing the execution.
   Suddenly, Bush began to feel the sting of experiences that had
bludgeoned Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Bush spoke of ``the
overwhelming events'' of the hostage crisis and commented, ``These
are not easy days.''
   Bush was spending the weekend with family at the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md., while national security aides monitored
the hostage developments at the White House.
   The president did not have any policy staff with him and the
hostage situation was considered ``stabilized,'' White House
spokesman Jay Allison said Saturday.
   He said Bush did routine paperwork, received intelligence
briefing materials and made phone calls during the morning, then
played tennis and went swimming.
   Back in Washington, U.S. officials sought to downplay any
negative interpretation of the Iranian news agency report on Iran
refusing a U.S. message last week.
   ``Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weigh
in,'' said one closely involved source who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We have been able to get our messages, one way or
another, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians.''
   It was last week _ with telephone calls to world leaders on
behalf of the hostages _ when Bush initiated what his press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, called ``the most defined and
high-level diplomatic effort I have ever seen'' in the Bush and
Reagan administrations.
   Complaining of inadequate intelligence from Lebanon, Bush
anguished with ``a heavy heart'' for four days over Higgins and
awaited word on hostage Joseph Cicippio, under a death threat from
the radical Revolutionary Justice Organization.
   After a long suspense, as the White House waged its intense
diplomatic effort and the Pentagon put on a display of military
muscle in the Middle East, Cicippio got a temporary reprieve from
his captors.
   No one knew for sure why Cicippio's sentenced was suspended. ``I
like to think that a broad-spread appeal to nations in every corner
of the globe had something to do with it,'' Bush said.
   The outcome spared Bush _ at least temporarily _ from pressure
to find an appropriate way to punish the terrorists without
endangering the remaining hostages or innocent civilians.
   Even so, Bush said Friday, ``I feel the burden of going to every
end possible to try to find _ get the return of these Americans to
their loved ones and find out the truth about Col. Higgins.''
   Such a burden can be perilous to presidents.
   Carter's White House became branded as a presidency held hostage
by the 441-day captivity of Americans in Iran, and the ordeal,
including a disastrous rescue attempt, helped drive him from office.
   For Reagan, the kidnapping of Americans in Lebanon led the White
House into the improbable Iran-Contra affair with embarrassing
revelations about criminal wrongdoing and clumsy attempts to trade
arms for hostages.
   William Schneider, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Bush ``looked
the same way all presidents look when they get to a hostage crisis.
He looked ineffectual and the United States look helpless.
   ``He's under pressure to do something and there's nothing he can
do,'' Schneider said. ``He rediscovered a lesson he should have
learned ... to resist the temptation to allow these things to
become a serious national crisis because you cannot control
events.''
   On the other hand, Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution, said Bush had performed well.
   ``He's a naturally cautious man and this is one of those times
when it was probably useful,'' said Hess. He said Bush had learned
from the experiences of Carter and Reagan.
   With the announcement of Higgins' death, Bush cut short a
speech-making trip in the West and rushed back to Washington,
hurriedly ordered a meeting Monday with military, diplomatic and
national security advisers, and then delivered a briefing to
congressional leaders.
   High-ranking Pentagon officials were seen entering the White
House carrying large charts and maps, giving rise to speculation
that a military strike was being planned.
   Nothing happened after the apparent shift to a crisis mode.
   At the Tuesday morning meeting of top White House aides, chief
of staff John Sununu emphasized the limitations Bush faced in
trying to employ military options.
   Stephen Studdert, a high-ranking aide, described Bush as
``outraged, incensed, but cognizant of the limitations on his
options and the need to be responsible.''
   Bush himself acknowledged in a 1986 report on terrorism that
retaliation was not an easy course. ``Our principles of justice
will not permit random retaliation against groups of countries,''
the report said.
   The White House began to reverse course. There was no crisis and
the government was not being immobilized by terrorists, press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Bush went ahead with a festive barbecue on the South Lawn
Tuesday night.
   With the immediate crisis behind him, Bush said he wanted to
follow up an offer from Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
to help find a solution to the hostage crisis. There also were
intriguing clues that the Soviet Union and Syria had been helpful.
   Fitzwater said the United States hoped last week's developments
``may open up some opportunity for improvement over the long haul.
... I don't think we're back at square one.''

<TEXT>
   The following is a translation by The
Associated Press of the Arab text of a statement issued Saturday by
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The statement quoted an unidentified ``responsible source'' at
the party as saying:
   ``Since the entity of Zionist terrorism committed the crime of
kidnapping the imam of Jibchit _ struggling Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid
and his two relatives _and the ensuing repercussions and global
reactions that cornered the criminal Zionists in an impasse, this
entity has tried to cover up its terrorist act and big crime which
violated the security and sovereignty of others and played havoc
with international human ethics, values and norms.
   ``So this entity launched what it called readiness to trade the
(Israeli) prisoners of war and the (Western) hostages for Sheik
Obeid and Shiite prisoners in the jails of Zionist occupation.
   ``It also returned today to propagate anew that negotiations
with Hezbollah in this regard were possible.
   ``We assert that Hezbollah has nothing to do at all with the
hostage issue or any negotiations related to this matter. This
issue concerns the kidnappers only. Everybody knows this by now and
knows the way to them (kidnappers) if they wanted to.
   ``Regarding the prisoners, any discussion is out of the
question. The Zionist entity has to understand it has miscalculated
and that the abduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid has blocked
chances for a swap.
   ``Therefore, the Zionist enemy should free Sheik Obeid first and
not promise itself and public opinion with what is impossible in
light of the crime it has committed.
   ``We are very eager to release all the Lebanese and Palestinian
mujahedeen (holy warriors) in the prisons of the Zionist enemy,
irrespective of their sects and affiliations because we consider
that any prisoner with the Zionists belongs to the resistance.
   ``We are as eager to obtain the release of other detainees like
Nidal Zaloum, Itaf Aylan and Abdul Hadi Suleiman, who belong to the
uprising heroes, and Anwar Yaseen and Soha Bishara, who belong to
the heroes of the Lebanese resistance, as much as we are eager to
obtain the release of the sons of Hezbollah.
   ``What the enemy is trying to leak about the beginning of
negotiations with Hezbollah is a sheer, false and baseless rumor.
It is a deceptive attempt to extricate itself from the great
impasse in which it has fallen as a result of its latest
foolishness whose consequences it did not foresee. It is also part
of a wicked plan to frustrate the morale of the strugglers of the
Islamic and nationalist resistance in Lebanon as well as the
intefadeh (uprising) in Palestine.
   ``Hezbollah.''

   Several thousand Azerbaijani nationalists rallied
in their capital Saturday to demand the resignations of their
legislators in Moscow and recognition for an independent political
group, an activist said.
   Aidun Amirbekov, who identified himself as a representative of
the People's Front of Azerbaijan, said the protest on Baku's
central Lenin Square was organized by his group.
   About 5,000 people held national flags and slogans demanding
more freedom for the southwestern republic, he said.
   The People's Front is demanding that the republic's
representatives in the Congress of Peoples' Deputies parliament in
Moscow resign because ``they didn't say anything'' at the last
session, said Amirbekov. He did not elaborate.
   Azerbaijan, which is mainly Moslem, has been embroiled in a
dispute with neighboring Armenia over control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of the Azerbaijan
republic, but its population is predominantly Armenian. Armenia,
which is mainly Christian, wants to annex it.
   The dispute has turned violent several times in the last 18
months. Scores of people have been killed, and thousands have fled
their homes.
   Amirbekov said his republic's People's Front, which was formed
in December, has urged a compromise in the dispute.
   People's Front organizations have sprung up in many of the 15
Soviet republics to advance local demands for more autonomy. They
have become especially strong in the Baltic republics.

   Two Palestinian prisoners at a desert detention
camp were slain by other political detainees, the army said
Saturday. It was not clear if the slayings were politically
motivated.
   Palestinian inmates have killed several other detainees accused
of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the Negev Desert camp,
which holds Palestinians detained in connection with the uprising
against Israeli control of the occupied territories.
   An army spokesman said the two bodies were discovered during a
count of prisoners Saturday at the Ketziot Detention Center. ``They
were killed by fellow inmates,'' the spokesman said.
   Arab and Israeli reporters said the new killings appeared to
stem from a personal quarrel. The army said it was investigating.
   It identified the victims as 28-year-old Ziad Added Mohammed
Banna and 32-year-old Salim Ali Jesh, both from the Gaza Strip.
   Arab reporters said Banna was detained six months ago for
hurling firebombs and that Jesh was accused of throwing stones.
   At least 88 Arabs accused of collaborating with Israeli
authorities have been killed by other Arabs since the uprising
began in December 1987. Army gunfire and Israeli settlers have
killed 527 Palestinians, and Arabs have killed 38 Israelis.
   The army said it imposed a curfew Saturday morning on the
Jabaliya refugee camp and the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in the
Gaza Strip.
   Arab reporters said troops in the two camps summoned all males
between the ages of 15 and 50 to central areas for questioning.
   The reporters also said troops shot and wounded at least two
people during disturbances in the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
   Ziad Abu Hillal, 11, of the Rafah refugee camp, was treated at a
hospital after a rubber bullet struck him above the left eye, and
23-year-old Abdul-Hadi Ibrahim Abu Ateliah of Gaza city was treated
at Ahli hospital for a leg wound caused by a plastic bullet, the
reporters said.
   The army said it had no information on the incidents.
   A military spokesman and army sources said Saturday that two
homemade pipe bombs connected to a timer exploded Friday night
beside a road leading to an army camp near a West Bank village, 40
miles north of Jerusalem.
   The army spokesman said there were no injuries or damage.

<TEXT>
   Government troops and U.S.-backed rebels
accused each other Saturday of breaking a June 24 cease-fire in
Angola's civil war, and confusion surrounded the future of talks
aimed at ending the conflict.
   An Angolan armed forces statement said three rebel battalions
attacked government soldiers in central Bie province. The statement
did not mention casualties but said the rebels used South
African-supplied artillery in the action.
   The ANGOP state news agency quoted military sources as saying 16
people died in other rebel attacks around the country.
   For the first time since the cease-fire, the army said it
engaged rebel forces, claiming government soldiers killed two
guerrillas who attacked barracks in northern Kwanza Norte province,
according to ANGOP.
   A statement from the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola accused the government of a number of
attacks in central Angola, including one in which a civilian was
killed.
   Both sides repeatedly have accused each other of attacks since
shortly after the truce, which was reached June 22 in Gbadolite,
Zaire, between Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The agreement charged Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko with
mediating peace talks. The first round of negotiations between the
warring sides, in Kinshasa, Zaire, were abandoned July 1 after dos
Santos accused the rebels of breaking the truce. Resumed talks
ended July 22 when rebel delegates asked for time to consult
Savimbi in his southeast Angolan stronghold of Jamba.
   The talks were to start again July 31. But they were postponed
after 42 people died when a military transport plane was shot down.
The government accused rebels of downing the plane. The rebels said
the aircraft was hit by fire from government forces.
   Government sources on Tuesday said dos Santos would meet Mobutu
for talks to put the peace process back on track, but no date has
been announced.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joginder Singh grabbed a piece of
shrapnel from a rocket that tore through his aunt's house Saturday,
wounding his three young cousins, and demanded to know why the
United States and the Soviet Union were allowing innocent Afghans
to be hurt and killed.
   Singh's relatives and the two young children of a neighbor
playing in the front yard were among the latest victims of the
rocketing of Kabul, an almost daily event since late June.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 13 rockets
pounded the capital Saturday, wounding eight people. During and
after his briefing, at least four more rockets fell, their
distinctive boom heard across much of the city.
   Amani said the rockets Saturday hit many areas but were
concentrated around Kabul's main grain silo, where several hundred
trucks loaded with wheat from the Soviet Union were waiting to be
unloaded.
   The rockets missed the silo, but one tore into the ground about
a yard in front of a watchtower on its perimeter, breaking the
tower's windows and those of nearby houses.
   For the last four or five months, Amani said, U.S.-backed
guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government have been
trying to starve this city by cutting roads and preventing food
deliveries.
   ``Now that they can't cut the roads and all these supplies are
coming to the city, their attack is to destroy what has already
been delivered. It is their aim to impose starvation,'' he said.
   The Singh family house is about 1{ miles from the silo.
   The home's metal roof was torn off, and a rocket's path could be
traced through two-foot-wide holes down to the ground floor. On the
second floor, where Singh said his 16-year-old cousin had been
ironing, a pile of newly pressed sheets, stained with blood, lay in
the rubble amid twisted fragments of shrapnel and the dusty iron.
   The windows in a primary school next to the two-story house were
shattered.
   ``If the school had been open, God knows how many students would
have been killed,'' Singh said. The government has extended the
summer holiday because of rocket attacks.
   ``We think this is a policy of the United States and the Soviet
Union. They are dividing the world ... and they are dividing Afghan
brothers, the Afghan country,'' said Singh, an Afghan of Indian
descent.
   ``If the government cannot protect the people, they have no
right to rule. And the United States and the Soviet Union, why are
they doing this to innocent people? What have we done?,'' he asked.
   According to U.N. sources, 281 people were killed and 745
injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing in Kabul from June 25
to Aug. 1. Virtually all were civilians.
   A three-day lull last week was broken Friday when 19 rockets
killed two people and injured nine, Amani said.
   The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, have claimed responsibility for some rocketing but insist
they aim at military targets and blame the government for hitting
civilian targets. The government denies it.
   Amani accused U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of
not doing enough to stop ``gross violations'' by the United States
and Pakistan of U.N.-mediated accords that were supposed to stop
U.S. arms supplies to the mujahedeen and Soviet arms supplies to
the Afghan army.
   He welcomed Perez de Cuellar's call Friday for a peaceful
settlement of the 10-year-old civil war but said it was ``not
enough.''
   The Afghan government hopes Perez de Cuellar will play ``a more
active and more serious role than he has played so far,'' Amani
said, noting he has been authorized to visit Kabul and Islamabad to
try to end the war.

<HEAD>Former Alabama Officer Captured in Texas 12 Years After Prison Escapef</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Alabama policeman who escaped
from prison 12 years ago while doing time for murder was found in
Texas, where he'd been living under an assumed name with a
different wife and children, authorities said.
   The short-order cook known for years in San Antonio as Ben
Francis Hurst turned out to be former Lt. Jimmy Ray Hurst, 56,
convicted in 1973 of killing his wife's boyfriend, authorities said.
   Circuit Judge William Sullivan, who sentenced Hurst to life in
prison for shooting Charles ``Cooter'' Mann, said the Alabama
Bureau of Investigation told him Hurst's identity had been
confirmed through fingerprints.
   San Antonio police arrested Hurst late Thursday, a little more
than a week after Alabama investigators asked them to watch a house
from which telephone calls had been placed to his mother, Julia
Hurst of Talladega.
   A neighbor said Hurst seemed like a model father to the three
children he adopted when he married Estela Gonzalez Hurst in 1978.
   ``You couldn't think Ben would be capable of something like
that. He's very friendly,'' said Linda Lopez. ``It's just
incredible.''
   Police were uncertain whether his wife knew of Hurst's past.
   ``She just couldn't believe it when I called her. She asked me
several times if I was lying,'' said detective Bob Farley. The
Hurst family has an unlisted telephone number in San Antonio.
   Hurst and his wife in Talladega had five children, records show.
It was unclear whether they remained married.
   San Antonio police investigator Richard Moreno said Hurst had
not made any effort to change his appearance, although he seemed to
have aged well beyond his years while on the run.
   He offered no resistance when confronted outside the Denny's
restaurant where he told officers he had worked for the past eight
years.
   Evidence in Hurst's 1973 trial showed he lured Mann, 26, to a
wooded area and shot him in the face. Hurst had been a fugitive
since March 1977, when he made his second escape from an Alabama
state prison.
   Hurst was being held without bond on two fugitive warrants. He
will be returned to Alabama as soon as possible, authorities said.

   A federal judge denied bail to three foreign
businessmen accused in a scheme to sell sophisticated computer
equipment to the Soviet Union.
   U.S. District Judge Carolyn Dimmick said Friday there was a
significant risk that the men would try to flee the country.
   Shiv Mohan, 40, of New Delhi, India; David Whyte, 35, of
Mississauga, Ontario, and John Townsend, 43, a Briton living in New
Castle, Australia, were arrested July 21 in Buffalo, N.Y., on a
criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle.
   They were arrested as they met with Robert Casperson, the
president of C-Tek, a Kirkland, Wash., computer company, allegedly
to discuss diverting $900,000 in computer equipment through Canada
to the Soviet Union. Casperson was cooperating with federal agents.
   All three were charged with conspiring to export U.S.-made
computer equipment without a Commerce Department export license.
Mohan and Townsend also were charged with attempting to illegally
export a sophisticated computer to the Soviet Union.
   The Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8700 super minicomputer that
federal agents say the men were trying to sell can be used to
design nuclear weapons, submarines and missile and radar tracking
systems.
   None of the equipment reached the Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
three other members of President Bush's Cabinet travel to Mexico
Sunday on a visit seen here as a milestone in recently improving
U.S.-Mexico relations.
   Mexican officials say they hope the meeting of the U.S.-Mexico
Binational Commission will ratify the ``spirit of Houston'' and
provide a platform for further progress.
   Aides say Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari hit it
off well at a meeting in November in Houston, when both were
presidents-elect.
   The rank and size of the U.S. delegation alone are a good sign
for the meeting being held Sunday and Monday, high-ranking Mexican
officials said on condition their names not be disclosed.
   The commission has not met for 2{ years, although meetings were
supposed to be held every six months. Mexican and U.S. officials
blamed the lapse on an political emphasis last year on presidential
elections in both nations.
   Although relations between the Salinas and Bush administrations
are going well, similar honeymoon periods at the beginning of
recent Mexican presidencies have ended in bitterness, recrimination
and nationalist anger.
   ``In the past, we have sometimes had a dialogue of the deaf,''
said a top Salinas administration official.
   The United States is sending Baker, Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Commerce
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
   Other top officials include FBI director William Sessions, Drug
Enforcement Administration head John C. Lawn, Environmental
Protection Agency chief William Reilly and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   The Mexican delegation will be led by the Foreign Minister,
Fernando Solana, and five other Cabinet ministers, chief among them
Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe.
   The participants will discuss ``everything from border bridges
to the differences between our legal systems,'' said one Mexican
official.
   The top issues will be continuing foreign debt negotiations and
narcotics trafficking; other issues include immigration, trade and
investment, pollution and tourism.
   The meeting comes only two weeks after Mexico reached agreement
on reducing $53 billion of its debt to foreign banks. Brady and
other U.S. officials helped drive the bargain. Final details,
however, still must be worked out.
   The deal got a mixed reception in Mexico, with Salinas declaring
it a triumph and critics saying it didn't do enough.
   Salinas is trying to revive an economy hurt by six years of
austerity following the collapse of oil prices in 1982, and he has
argued that debt reduction is the only way to provide capital for
investment.
   He has liberalized trade laws and taken other steps to enourage
investment and exports, not just from the United States but also
from countries such as Japan and South Korea.
   Although U.S. officials have been pleased by many of Salinas'
actions, one said, ``They're not doing this to make us happy.
They're doing it because they think it will work.''
   One remaining rub is patent law, with U.S. companies complaining
that Mexican companies copy their products without compensation.
But even there, officials said, progress is being made.
   While Mexico got help on the debt, U.S. officials have been
effusive in their praise for Mexico's efforts to combat drug
trafficking. Salinas has cracked down hard, arresting top
traffickers and corrupt officials who had been untouchable for
years.
   Mexican officials still argue, however, that the real problem is
the demand for drugs in the United States.
   Mexicans also criticize the U.S. attitude towards Mexican
immigrants, who they say are taking jobs Americans are unable or
unwilling to fill.
   Salinas has run some political risks in appearing to accommodate
the United States on so many issues. Few Mexicans forget for long
that half of what was once Mexico was conquered or bought by the
United States.
   Although Mexico is now an urban society and the 13th largest
industrial nation in the world, the psychological problems of U.S.
condescension and Mexican sensitivity can still get in the way of
normal relations.

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress elected Jaime Paz Zamora
president early Saturday and the left-leaning former vice president
pledged to consolidate democracy and economic stability.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press after the
congressional vote, Paz Zamora said, ``I wish to express my
profound gratitude to the Bolivian people who, abiding by the
constitution, have expressed their will electing me president of
Bolivia.''
   He was elected by Congress because no candidate received a
majority in a May election.
   Paz Zamora, 50, a sociologist and leader of the
Social-Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left, will be sworn
in Sunday afternoon in the presence of five South American heads of
state, U.S. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Prescott Bush,
brother of President Bush.
   Outgoing President Victor Paz Estenssoro, 82, will address a
joint session of Congress, ending a half-century political career
that includes four presidential terms.
   The new president, Paz Estenssoro's nephew, has said he will
maintain a free-market economy and welcome foreign investments
while giving special attention to improving the educational system
and health care. He met with U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard
Thursday and said he is particularly interested in investments in
the mining sector.
   In the May 7 presidential election, Paz Zamora came in third
with 19 percent. But in negotiations he gained the support of
former dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez who had finished second in the
balloting.
   The support of Banzer and his rightist party assured Paz Zamora
of victory in the congressional vote and he won with 98 of the 156
ballots.
   Under Bolivia's Constitution, if no candidate wins a majority in
the popular vote Congress elects the president by choosing from
among the top threet vote getters in the general election.
   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the governing party's candidate,
received the most votes in the May 7 election with 24 percent, but
received only 49 votes in the congressional balloting. Banzer, a
former general, won 23 percent of the vote in the general election.
   Congress also elected lawyer Luis Ossio Sanjines, an ally of
Banzer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, vice
president. Paz Zamora and Ossio Sanjines will serve four-year terms.
   Paz Zamora and Banzer, in forming the alliance, also agreed to
form a coalition government. Banzer's conservative Nationalist
Democratic Action Party will receive 10 Cabinet seats and Paz
Zamora's party seven.
   Their parties will share responsabilities in dealing with the
economy and Banzer will oversee a Supreme Council that is to
determine the government's overall policy.
   Banzer gained power in a coup in 1971 and ruled until 1978. In
1974, Paz Zamora was accused of plotting to overthrow Banzer's
government and he was jailed for six months and sent into exile.
   Banzer's decision Wednesday to back Paz Zamora for the
presidency surprised many Bolivians and led to a brief bank run
with thousands of people forming long lines at banks to withdraw
their deposits.
   Paz Zamora, once a Marxist, is considered now to be
left-of-center with ties to European Social Democratic parties.
   Cavazos, speaking to reporters upon his arrival Friday, said,
``President Bush looks forward to cooperating with the new Bolivian
administration in the many bilateral and international issues that
concern us.'' He said Bolivia has made progress with its economic
program ``which has become a model for other nations gripped by
hyperinflation and crippled by economic instability.''
   Paz Zamora inherits an economy that five years ago had an
inflation rate of 24,000 percent but is now running at an annual
rate of 6 percent.
   Sunday's swearing in ceremony will install Bolivia's 76th
government since the country became independent from Spain in 1825.
The inauguration will be the first time in 25 years that a
government completed its term and relinquished power to a
democratically elected successor.

   Residents of Nizhny Tagilsk, a steel town in the
Ural Mountains, are accustomed to area rivers running black and
brown from industrial residue.
   The Tass news agency reported Saturday that some municipal
workers volunteered to try to clean one of the most polluted rivers
and were surprised when they found flakes of yellow metal in the
grime.
   Scientists confirmed the flakes were gold and the workers
combined panning and cleaning.
   Tass said the workers collected 11 pounds of gold from about a
mile of the river and the metal was sold by city officials for
$59,000. The agency reported the money was used to buy medical
equipment for the city.
   Nizhny Tagilsk, 550 miles east of Moscow, has a reputation of
being one of the most polluted cities in the Soviet Union, even
abandoned by the ravens that once settled there. But with the
degree of gold panning under way its rivers may get cleaner.

<TEXT>
   A stone coffin filled with gold jewelry was
unearthed by archaeologists in the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud,
the official Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
   It was the second discovery of a gold-laden burial in Nimrud
this year.
   The agency quoted Muadad Saeed, Iraq's director of antiquities,
as saying the find included ``hundreds of gold ornaments and pieces
of jewelry.''
   He said they were believed to belong to Queen Ninli Shomi
Marmani, the wife of King Assirnasurpal II, who ruled from 884-858
B.C.
   The coffin was found 13 feet below ground and tablets in
wedge-shaped cuneiform writing also were associated with the royal
burial, Saeed said.
   Nimrud, the military capital of the ancient Assyrian empire that
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, is 25 miles
south of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
   In April, Iraqi archaeologists unearthed a stone chamber at
Nimrud that contained the burials of two women accompanied by 55
pounds of gold jewelry. A stone inscription in the tomb in
cuneiform writing identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya,
possibly the daughter and grand-daughter of King Sargon, who ruled
Assyria in the 8th century B.C.
   The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the
burial chamber.
   ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I pray
to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in the
scorching sun after death ... Let the ghost of insomnia take hold
of him for ever and ever,'' it said.
   The gold jewelery included necklaces, belts, brcelets, anklets
and 50 pairs of earrings.

   Police fired tear gas into a
church Saturday to disperse peaceful mourners at a post-funeral
ceremony for two black activists killed in a bomb blast, a Roman
Catholic priest said.
   The Rev. Richard O'Rourke said police used dozens of canisters
of tear gas to break up the traditional post-funeral meal attended
by about 500 people at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in
Bonteheuwel, a mixed-race area outside Cape Town.
   ``The people couldn't get out of the church so they broke down
the emergency doors and came into (an adjoining) house,'' O'Rourke
said. ``Every time the people tried to go out, they were beaten
back time and time again.''
   Later, police fired tear gas on about 50 people trying to visit
South Africa's oldest imprisoned activist, Oscar Mpetha, who turned
80 on Saturday.
   Police refused to allow the group into Groote Schuur Hospital in
Cape Town, where Mpetha receives treatment for diabetes. He was
sentenced to five years' jail for terrorism in 1985.
   In the first incident, O'Rourke said police acted without
provocation from mourners, who had come from a joint funeral for
Coline Williams, 23, and Robbie Waterwitch, 20.
   Police said there were no arrests or serious injuries, but they
refused to comment further.
   Ms. Williams and Waterwitch died last month when a bomb they
were planting in a public toilet exploded prematurely, according to
police.
   Friends said the two supported the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement, which is fighting the South African
government.
   ``One must not be surprised that in the end, young people begin
to think that to plant bombs is the only way to bring change,''
said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, at the funeral.
   There have been several bombings in the last two weeks as the
country prepares for elections Sept. 6, which exclude the black
majority. Under apartheid, South African blacks have no voice in
national affairs. The white minority controls the government and
economy.
   ``Thank you, Coline. Thank you, Robbie. Thanks especially to you
young people in your dedication to justice and peace, caring and
humanity,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   About 5,000 people attended the funeral service at St. Mark's
Catholic Church in the mixed-race township of Athlone, singing
freedom songs and waving the banned green, gold and black flag of
the guerrilla organization.
   Police confiscated flags draped over the two coffins. But
additional flags were smuggled past them at the Maitland Cemetery

   The 5,000 mourners formed one of the largest crowds allowed at a

   Army soldiers joined weary firefighters in hard-hit Idaho on
Saturday, working to save summer homes and thousands of acres of
timber as forest fires sprang to life again with the return of warm
weather.
   Weather also posed new worries in other parts of the West as two
days of relatively cool conditions gave way to new forecasts for
rising temperatures, low humidity and lightning storms.
   ``We are bracing for some storms that could come in on Sunday,''
said Debie Chivers, a spokeswoman for the Boise (Idaho) Interagency
Fire Center, the national headquarters for fighting wildfires.
   At midday Saturday, 220,000 acres were burning nationwide and
1.4 million acres had burned so far this season, according to the
center. The number of people fighting the latest spate of blazes,
which broke out 1{ weeks ago when a rash of lightning storms raked
the West, totaled 23,000.
   Nearly half the area affected by active fires this weekend was
in Idaho, where blazes mushroomed from about 90,000 acres Friday to
102,000 acres Saturday. Large fires also persisted in Oregon and
California, and smaller range and timberland blazes were being
fought or mopped up in Utah, Montana, Nebraska and Wyoming.
   In central Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service and the Army joined
forces in a 1,200-acre ``burnout'' in Payette National Forest to
save about 130 structures, including 70 summer cabins. Helicopters
dropped flammable pellets to create a blackened buffer between a
21,800-acre complex of fires and the homes.
   In the northern part of the forest, a 4,200-acre fire lunged
against fire lines created to protect the historic mining town of
Warren.
   ``We've had numerous spots jump over the line,'' Payette Forest
spokeswoman Jeanne Felmy said. ``They work on the spots as they
appear, hitting them from the air and the ground.''
   About 500 soldiers from the 4th Infantry ``Iron Horse'' group
from Colorado joined firefighting crews in Idaho as support, and an
additional 700 from Fort Riley, Kan., were expected Monday.
   The Boise center has managed so far to get people and supplies
where they are needed most. ``But if we get another bust (of
lightning-caused fires), things are going to be challenging,'' said
another spokesman, Ken Showalter.
   In eastern Oregon, firefighters expected to contain four large
fires totaling 50,000 acres by the end of the weekend.
   However, a 10,300-acre fire in the Hells Canyon National
Recreation Area was not expected to be contained until Tuesday,
said Wendy Evans, spokeswoman for the Northwest Interagency
Coordination Center.
   ``We were able to get the upper hand,'' Evans said. ``Now, the
weather's getting warmer and dryer, and we can expect activity in
these fires.''
   More than 9,000 firefighters, including 1,300 soldiers from Fort
Lewis, Wash., were on fire lines in Oregon, she said.
   In Southern California, a 14,000-acre wildfire felled
century-old timber and charred vegetation in the Cleveland National
Forest.
   Fire officials said they had surrounded 40 percent of the
week-old blaze straddling the Riverside-San Diego County line about
90 miles southeast of Los Angeles but couldn't predict when the
fire would be contained.
   More than 2,000 firefighters struggled against constantly
changing winds and high temperatures.
   The fire, however, is actually doing some good, Forest Service
officials said. The blaze is consuming aging plants that have
choked new forest growth, including dead trees infested with
insects.
   ``Some of that area was so dense a person couldn't walk
through,'' said Forest Service spokeswoman Roxanne Stager.
   The historic Mount Palomar observatory and a sanctuary for bald
eagles and spotted owls that was threatened earlier by the inferno
were out of danger, firefighters said.
   In Utah, firefighters contained a 60-acre brush fire just east
of Provo on Saturday morning after a two-day struggle on the steep
slopes of the Wasatch Mountains.
   In south-central Montana, a grassland fire on the Crow Indian
Reservation leaped fire lines and burned about 2,000 acres of
grassland overnight, but did not threaten any buildings, officials
said.
   In northwestern Nebraska, firefighters mopped up a blaze that
consumed up to 3,000 acres of timbered canyon and forced the
evacuation of 30 people earlier in the week.
   In Wyoming, a small fire affected 45 acres Saturday in the
Bridger-Teton National Forest in the northwestern part of the
state. Officials said they hoped to contain it by Monday.

<HEAD>Rail Workers Stop Trains in Pay Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rail workers in southwestern Poland
stopped trains for an hour Saturday in their latest bid to pressure
the government for pay increases to counter triple-digit inflation.
   The rail stoppage came as new Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak
met with economic and political specialists from the opposition
Solidarity movement in an effort to assemble a Cabinet.
   Former Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, now first
secretary of the Communist Party, conferred with party and army
leaders Saturday, urging them to be proud of the party and defend
it from ``demagogic attacks.''
   Rakowski told the army officers meeting in Warsaw that in the
past the armed forces served as ``a strong support of people's
rule. The situation is the same today and I believe it will
continue in the future.''
   The rail stoppage between noon and 1 p.m. affected domestic rail
traffic in the Silesia region except for certain trains taking
children to summer camps, according to reports in the official
media and from the Solidarity Information Service.
   State television said about 80 trains were stopped.
   The strike was supported both by Solidarity and the official
communist-allied trade unions.
   Jan Renda, leader of a strike committee in Katowice, said rail
workers now receive $60 a month in basic pay plus overtime and
various differentials and bonuses.
   The workers want the basic pay increased to $96 a month along
with cost-of-living adjustments recently approved by Parliament.
   Management is offering to raise the basic pay to $84, but that
would include a cost-of-living adjustment that has not yet been
computed, state television reported.
   The average monthly income in Poland is $127, according to
government statistics.
   Renda, interviewed on state television, said, ``If our demands
are not met, we expect the worse _ a general (railway) strike _
something that has never happened in the postwar period.''
   Solidarity and the government media reported strikes by postal
workers in Legnica, by workers at a tire factory in Gruzdiaz and by
tram-car operators in Walbrzych.
   Strikes for higher pay have become common as the cost of living
increases steadily. It is estimated the inflation rate for this
year will exceed 120 percent.
   Gen. Kiszczak, who was turned down Thursday when he asked
Solidarity Sen. Zofia Kuratowska to join his government, continued
meetings with Solidarity lawmakers.
   Kiszczak met Saturday with Solidarity Deputy Ryszard Bugaj and
opposition political theorists Bronislaw Geremek and Deputy Jacek
Kuron.

<TEXT>
   A swimming pool that was off-limits to
blacks for 34 years reopened Saturday to both blacks and whites
following complaints by a church group.
   ``It's about time,'' said Bernard Daniel, a 34-year-old black
man who stopped outside the Saluda Swim and Tennis Club on his way
to a wedding.
   Few people showed up at the pool despite a temperature of 100
degrees.
   Daniel said he and a friend tried to obtain a pool membership
three years ago, but were refused.
   ``I was told it was for white men,'' he recalled. Nothing was
done at the time, although there were ``people here who knew it was
wrong,'' Daniel said.
   The pool in this town 45 miles south of Columbia was closed July
26 following publicity about the club's refusal July 13 to admit
three black youths who were part of a church group that had
arranged to use the pool.
   The land on which the club stands was deeded to the town in 1933
with the stipulation that it was for the use by the ``white
children'' of the county and town of Saluda. The stipulation
remained when the town sold the land to the Saluda Jaycees for $5
in 1955.
   The swim and tennis club rents the land from the Jaycees and
enforced the rule. After the church group complained, the Jaycees
ordered the pool closed until it was desegregated.
   A few black families purchased half-price memberships Saturday,
but no one was waiting in line when the pool opened. About five
black people swam, and about 50 cars stopped so occupants could get
a glimpse.
   Janet Sibert, who is black, brought her two children and
purchased a membership. ``I'm happy the kids will be able to
swim,'' said Mrs. Sibert, who lives in Greenwood, about 28 miles
from Saluda.
   Asked why she brought her children to the Saluda pool, Mrs.
Sibert, who works in Saluda, said, ``I think that's obvious. We
were interested, and we came.
   ``I want my children to feel good about themselves and know they
can swim where they want to,'' she said.
   Robert Booth, president of the pool's seven-member board of
directors, said he was pleased that the pool opened under the
desegregation policy.
   ``It's going well,'' he said. ``I feel like (blacks) will start
coming to the pool.''
   Jamie Willis, 17, who is white, said they probably wouldn't.
   ``They think they're not wanted there,'' said Miss Willis, who
was watching and said she was not a club member.
   She also said that the $80 seasonal membership fee to belong to
the swim and tennis club _ which consists of a wading pool, the
medium-sized swimming pool, and two cracked, overgrown tennis
courts _ might be too expensive for many people in the mostly rural
town of about 3,000 people.
   Several white high school youths who were sitting in their cars
by the pool said they didn't want black people there.
   ``I don't know why they want to come here,'' said one
16-year-old boy who would not give his name. ``I don't care if it's
discrimination. I'm not going swimming with them.''

<HEAD>Judge Blasts HUD, Dallas in Public Housing Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge, in a ruling that lambasted city
and federal housing officials, said Dallas helped create a
segregated public housing system and must help pay to dismantle it.
   In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer
blasted the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development,
the city and the Dallas Housing Authority for what he called a
``long, unbroken history'' of segregation in housing.
   Buchmeyer accused the three of deliberately disrupting plans to
correct the problem, and said he would appoint a special master to
monitor compliance of a 1987 consent agreement handled in his court.
   ``The undisputed facts establish that the city was a substantial
cause of deliberate racial segregation and discrimination in its
public housing programs,'' Buchmeyer said.
   His ruling added the city to the list of defendants in a
4-year-old desegregation case against the housing authority and
HUD. He said he would rule later what financial share the city
would assume.
   Seven black women sued in 1985, contending that thousands of
federally assisted apartments in Dallas were segregated by race and
unequal in conditions because of a longstanding pattern of
discrimination by HUD and the city housing authority.
   The judge approved a settlement in January 1987 requiring
demolition of most of the dilapidated West Dallas housing project
and relocation of tenants to private, rent-subsidized apartments
throughout Dallas and the suburbs.
   Another part of his Friday ruling could have the effect of
freeing up an estimated $3 million in federal funds for the
demolitions. The funds were frozen by an amendment written by a
Texas congressman to a HUD appropriations bill.
   Buchmeyer found that Mayor Annette Strauss and other city
officials have chosen to ignore the 1987 decree.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Buchmeyer's ruling would lead
to improvements for thousands of poor families living in federally
financed slums.
   ``It's the first time a city has been ordered to join with a
housing authority to desegregate its housing,'' said attorney Mike
Daniel. ``And it's the first time a city has been ordered to fund
the remedies for the separate and unequal conditions it helped
create.''
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Mary Dews, one of the plaintiffs in the
case who has lived in subsidized housing for 20 years.
   ``There's a lot of people who say racism doesn't exist in
Dallas, but this shows that it does,'' she said.
   Mrs. Strauss, contacted Friday while vacationing in California,
would not comment on the ruling on the advice of the city attorney
until the city council could be briefed.
   ``We have to hear what the attorney will recommend,'' Mrs.
Strauss said. ``Until we know that, we don't do anything.''
   Assistant City Attorney Donald Postell declined to comment, as
did attorneys for the housing authority and HUD.
   Buchmeyer ruled unconstitutional a 1988 amendment by U.S. Rep.
Martin Frost, D-Texas. It prohibits use of federal money for
demolition of any of the nearly 3,500 apartments at the West Dallas
project.
   Under the court-approved settlement, 839 apartments in the West
Dallas project were to be renovated and the rest demolished.
Residents could seek alternate, privately owned housing with
federal rent-subsidy certificates. The cost of the demolition was
estimated at $20,000 per unit.
   Buchmeyer said the Frost Amendment was unconstitutional because
it violated separation of powers.
   Frost said he felt the housing should be renovated rather than
razed.

   About 1,000 demonstrators marched Saturday
demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland,
and police said 46 people were arrested when right-wing opponents
confronted the marchers.
   Police moved in as a group from the right-wing British National
Party made their way to the march in north London, which was
organized by the Irish Freedom Movement in advance of the 20th
anniversary on Aug. 14 of the deployment of British troops in the
province.
   The British National Party staged a counterdemonstration in
central London, and a group of marchers later went to the Irish
march, police said.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 39 of those arrested were from the right-wing march and seven
were from the Irish march.
   British troops were deployed into the mainly Protestant province
to control sectarian fighting. The mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army is fighting to drive the British force from the
province and unite it with Ireland.

   A Texas woman says the Lone Star State's
official mammal and unofficial roadside distraction _ the armadillo
_ could solve a flap over license plates.
   Margaret Knox told the Texas Highway Commission that it should
dump plans to put ``The Friendship State'' on Texas license plates
and choose instead plates shaped like armadillos.
   Between the numbers and letters on the plate would be a star,
representing Texas' standing as the Lone Star state.
   ``I think it's very realistic. It would be real neat,'' Mrs.
Knox, 64, said Saturday.
   Since unveiling the design for ``The Friendship State'' plate
last month, the highway department has been flooded with complaints
from people saying the slogan doesn't fit the spirit of Texas.
Politicians have entered the controversy, saying the slogan is
wimpy.
   ``If you have to advertise that you're friendly, forget it,''
Mrs. Knox said. ``I think it's terrible.''
   She got the idea for the armadillo plate six years ago on a
Canadian trip when she saw a license plate for the Northwest
Territories shaped like a polar bear. ``It was striking,'' she said.

   Between the baby bottle and the brown
bag, there were lunch boxes.
   ``They were the first status symbols,'' said Scott Bruce, 34,
who has stirred the interest of baby boomers with a string of
enterprises celebrating that old schoolyard standard in all its
glorious incarnations.
   That Barbie doll box bought at the dime store for $3.49 back
somewhere in the mid-1970s can fetch hundreds of dollars at auction
these days. Bruce collects and resells them.
   The Beatles, the Jetsons, Mickey Mouse, Howdy Doody and even
yesteryear's teen idol, Bobby Sherman, are also among the blue-chip
boxes most highly prized by people generally between the age of 25
and 40, Bruce said.
   About 120 million lunch boxes were sold in their heyday between
1950 and 1970. So, according to Bruce's calculations, every baby
boomer carried at least one, sometimes two, to school each year.
   ``By the end of the 1950s there were four competing lunchbox
companies,'' Bruce said. ``Kids had a choice of models that
reflected their personalities, sort of like an automobile
showroom.''
   Now lunch boxes are available only in plastic. The last steel
version, featuring Rambo, was pressed in 1987, phasing out the
metal models more than a decade after a mother whose son got struck
in the head with one brought and won a lawsuit banning them in
Florida.
   Bruce saw the ban coming. He knew it was only a matter of time
before baby boomers in search of nostalgia created a demand.
   He spent about $10,000 on his entire collection of 1,500 boxes
and thermoses, a fifth of which he recently auctioned for $17,000.

   Fighting broke out among a crowd of
thousands on this beach resort's mile-long boardwalk after a power
outage left the area in darkness, authorities said.
   ``The lights flickered and everybody went crazy,'' said Eric
Slavin, manager of Lucky's Towels on the boardwalk. ``People
started kicking down garbage cans, people were yelling and
screaming and egging it on.''
   People smashed windows, overturned garbage cans and began
fighting after the lights went out around 1 a.m. Saturday, police
said.
   About 25 people were arrested, most for misdemeanors such as
fighting and disturbing the peace, said Mayor George Tompkins.
   More than 200 police officers and 14 police dogs from 45
departments arrived on the scene, said Borough Police Capt. Gerald
LaStella.
   Police blocked the bridge leading to the island community and
evacuated people from the boardwalk.
   ``There were kids running around throwing bottles, knocking over
garbage cans and some attempted to steal some things from the
stands,'' said LaStella.
   No injuries were reported, police said. Water and sewer service
was maintained by back-up generators.
   ``The boardwalk was full and the nightclubs were full. It wasn't
rioting, it was fighting,'' said Tompkins, who added that damage
was minor.
   Some people were stuck on amusement rides, but police helped
them off, he said.
   Order was restored about 3 a.m., Tompkins said.
   LaStella said up to 25,000 people were on the boardwalk at the
time of the power failure. Some merchants said the figure was
closer to 6,000. Officials say the small community, which has a
year-round population of about 2,100, swells to about 100,000
people on summer weekends.
   The outage occurred when a substation transformer of the Jersey
Central Power &amp; Light Co. failed, said a company spokesman, James
F. Lowney.
   He expected power to be restored Saturday evening.

   Flooding in Vermont destroyed a house, at least two bridges and
several highways on Saturday, and 85 mph winds wreaked havoc in the
Midwest.
   Much of the nation got wet. Showers and thunderstorms were
reported in Colorado, New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, Kansas,
Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,
Virginia, North Carolina and northern New England.
   Overnight heavy rain sent the Stevens Branch River at Barre,
Vt., over its banks. There was also flooding on the Winooski River
between Montpelier and Middlebury and at the Dog River at
Montpelier.
   Heavy rain caused several mudslides between Hancock and
Middlebury. In Plainsfield, flooding damaged or destroyed a house,
two bridges and several roads.
   In Iowa, there were numerous reports of thunderstorm winds and
damage. Gusts hit 85 mph at Carroll, 80 mph at Boone, 70 mph at
Perry and Urbandale and 60 mph at Adair. Hail up to an inch in
diameter fell.
   Near Ponca, Neb., hail and winds gusting over 60 mph caused
extensive crop damage.
   Thunderstorm gusts damaged trees and power lines near the
Wisconsin towns of Broadhead and Albany. Golf ball-size hail fell
in Avon, Ind.
   Heavier rainfall by 2 p.m. EDT included 3 inches at Mount
Washington, N.H.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 100 degrees at Needles, Calif.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 35 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in New
England, New Jersey, the northern and central Appalachians, the
lower Great Lakes region, the Ohio Valley, southern Illinois,
western Tennessee and Arkansas.
   Temperatures were expected to be much lower from the upper Great

<TEXT>
   The National Women's Political Caucus
will concentrate next year on electing abortion-rights candidates
in key states across the nation, the group's leader said Saturday.
   The campaign, called ``Empower America,'' will target races in
Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio,
North Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, caucus chairwoman Irene
Natividad said at the organization's annual convention.
   ``We are the pro-choice foot soldiers in the electoral trenches
of this country,'' Natividad told 1,200 delegates and guests.
``They say we have not yet proven that women vote as a bloc. Well,
let me tell you, that is going to change.''
   Actress Cybill Shepherd and former Republican National Committee
Chairwoman Mary Louise Smith also addressed the organization of
female politicians.
   Outside, about 30 anti-abortion activists picketed for about two
hours.
   ``We believe the majority of women around the country are not
pro-choice,'' said protester Georgeann McGarry of New Brighton.
``They are pro-life, and we are here to represent them.''
   The campaign is a response to a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing states to restrict abortions.
   Natividad said target states have legislatures that could swing
in favor of abortion rights depending on the outcome of a small
number of races.
   ``This is a pragmatic political plan that we know as pragmatic
politicians will be effective,'' Natividad said. ``The times are
tough for the women in this country, but we are tougher. We are not
going to get mad. We are going to get even.''
   ``The pro-choice issue is the winning issue because women aren't
willing to go backward,'' said U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. ``We
aren't willing to go back to those back-alley abortions and to
those coat hangers.''
   Political consultant Harrison Hickman told the convention that
abortion-rights candidates must appeal to what he said was the
majority of Americans who support a women's choice to have an
abortion although they might disagree with it.
   Natividad said local abortion-rights groups will recruit and
train legislative candidates. She had no estimate for the
campaign's cost.
   Miss Shepherd, spokeswoman for a political action committee
called Voters for Choice, said reproductive decisions should rest
with the individual.
   ``It will be a test of our commitment and political will (as to)
whether the same rights will be available to an unemployed women in
a New Orleans housing project, the 16-year-old daughter of a coal
miner in the hills of Kentucky or a Native American woman living in
the far reaches of Utah,'' she said. ``Their plight must be our
fight.''
   Former RNC Chairwoman Smith told the group the caucus must
convey the message that supporting reproductive rights is ``a good
thing to do.''
   ``Mainstream Republican voices have not been heard from loudly
on this issue,'' she said. ``Maybe we should turn up the volume.''
   At a news conference, former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro said she expected the abortion issue to
affect every political race in the country.
   ``The choice has to be left to women and it has to be a safe
procedure,'' she said. ``I think that what this issue will do is
mobilize people who care about human rights and civil rights.''
   The four-day convention is scheduled to end Sunday. The caucus
has about 77,000 members of all political affiliations, Natividad
said.

   Space officials were confident
Saturday as a veiled countdown began for launching the shuttle
Columbia on Tuesday with five military astronauts and a secret spy
satellite.
   It will be the first flight in 3{ years for Columbia, the oldest
shuttle, which required more extensive overhaul than its two sister
ships after the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   NASA gave the go-ahead to start the countdown early Saturday
even though workers were several hours behind schedule in
completing routine work on the spaceship's engine compartment.
   Officials said later that the launch team was optimistic that
all lagging work would be caught up by Sunday and that liftoff
would occur as planned between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   The Pentagon will not let NASA disclose the status of the
countdown or the exact launch time, citing national security
reasons.
   Because the mission is classified, countdown displays normally
available to the news media remained blank, and only members of the
launch team and key NASA and Pentagon officials were supposed to
know where the clock stood.
   The countdown will be made public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff.
   The five astronauts flew here Saturday from their training base
in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
   Asked by a reporter if he had confidence in riding in Columbia
after it had been grounded for so long, commander Brewster Shaw, an
Air Force colonel, replied: ``Absolutely; you bet I do. I wouldn't
fly it if I didn't. ... I flew Columbia a long time ago. It's a
great machine.''
   Shaw piloted Columbia on a November 1983 trip.
   With him on the upcoming flight will be Navy Cmdr. Richard
Richards, Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and
Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   The Defense Department will not disclose the nature of their
mission. But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
during four or five days in orbit they will deploy a large
reconnaissance satellite and a smaller research payload and conduct
experiments designed to define what role military astronauts can
play in space.
   Once Columbia is in orbit, about nine minutes after liftoff, the
Pentagon will impose a blackout on all information about the
flight, except for three brief announcements about the health of
the spacecraft and the landing time.
   The silence will be broken only if there is a major problem.
   Defense officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult
for Soviet satellites and spy ships stationed off Cape Canaveral to
monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already
know a great deal about the mission and that once Columbia's
satellite is in orbit, the Soviets will be able to track it
precisely and know what it is doing.
   This will be the 30th space shuttle flight and the fourth
dedicated to a Defense Department mission.
   Columbia last was launched in January 1986, returning to Earth
just 10 days before the Challenger explosion killed seven
astronauts. After the accident, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration concentrated on modifying the newer orbiters,
Discovery and Atlantis, before getting Columbia ready.
   Discovery and Atlantis each flew twice since flights resumed
last September after a 32-month hiatus.

<TEXT>
   Lightning has set the West ablaze this
summer, and electricity is again surging through the nation's
wildfire command post.
   ``The whole place is running at the max, full out,'' Reed Jarvis
of the Boise Interagency Fire Center said last week.
   But this year is different because the center's strategists and
quartermasters who direct the nation's wildfire battles can see
some of the worst blazes from their windows.
   As nearly half the acreage afire burns within 150 miles,
specialists in the logistics center marshal resources from around
the nation. On Saturday, there were about 220,000 acres ablaze in
four states, with 102,000 of them in Idaho and the rest in Oregon,
California and Utah.
   ``Tell me when the airplane's got to leave and I'll have the
team on it,'' coordinator Lynn Findley says into the phone cradled
on his shoulder.
   He hangs up, makes another call and arranges for a procurement
expert to fly from Atlanta to LaGrande, Ore.
   Another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire
officer called ``Joe Blow.''
   ``Can you believe it?'' she says over her shoulder. ``He spells
his name B-L-O-U-G-H.''
   Others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones,
scanning computer terminals for personnel, airplanes, red chemical
retardant and gear.
   ``We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique
airplanes,'' declares the slogan on one T-shirt.
   In one leg of the L-shaped logistics room, the intelligence
division keeps track of fires around the country. The other finds
the crews and equipment to attack the flames. A big chalkboard
plots the fires as they eat up mile after mile of fuel. Magnets
resembling aircraft dot a map of the country, giving the location
and type of equipment available.
   ``Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful,'' said Fire
Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. ``But the support people are
dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently
dangerous.''
   Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for
days after the last ``lightning bust.'' One storm laid down 2,000
strikes an hour with little rain. Then winds reaching 80 mph and
temperatures pushing triple digits whipped those spots into major
conflagrations.
   Three-inch-thick burning branches blew up to two miles ahead of
the main fires. Flames swept over thousands of acres in several
hours' time, creating a smoky miasma around Idaho's capital city.
The buzz at the wildfire nerve center intensified dramatically.
   ``Fortunately we don't work at this level all year,'' Hartigan
said. ``It would be unbearable if we had to do this 365 days a
year.''
   The complex has taken on a military look. National Guard troops
in camouflage fatigues march toward trucks for transportation to
the fire lines. Smoke jumpers sit in the shade of a building
waiting for their next leap into 100-foot-tall ponderosa pines,
laden with chainsaws or water pumps.
   ``We are definitely an assault organization,'' Hartigan said.
``It's patterned after military operations because they work. We're
the supply lines for the troops.''
   In the logistics center, specialists spin Lazy Susans with pink
and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is
answered.
   The requests are for airplanes, helicopters, axes and shovels,
portable marine pumps, hoses, fresh fruit, disposable sleeping
bags, soft drinks and, most important, manpower.
   World War II Navy bombers _ PB-4Y2s and Neptunes _ are lined up
on the flight deck, spattered with red retardant. They fill up
again and again with thousands of gallons of ``slurry,'' a
fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold. Then the craft
roar aloft toward the smoky mountains to the north.
   After five dry summers, backcountry timber has a moisture
content only slightly higher than kiln-dried lumber, and
strategists have settled in for a long campaign.
   It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the
nation's fires. Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire
Center, and the pace will be frenetic.
   ``It's like Wall Street, it's like an operating room,'' Jarvis
says. ``Everybody knows it's stressful, but they're not snapping at
each other. The key is cooperation.''

<HEAD>Opposition Wins Two of Three Seats in By-Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition candidates won two of three
seats contested for Parliament in multiparty elections Saturday,
state television reported.
   In the third by-election race, the required number of voters did
not participate and another election will be held.
   Although only three of 387 parliamentary seats were contested,
the poor showing by the Communist Party was considered an
indication of voter sentiment before national multiparty elections
planned for June.
   Low voter turnouts and the failure of a candidate to win a
majority in by-elections on July 5 led to Saturday's round. By law,
a turnout of more than 50 percent is mandatory and the winner must
receive a majority of the votes cast.
   Less than 50 percent of the eligible voters turned out for the
election at Kiskunfelegyhaza and another round will have to be
scheduled, state television reported.
   The two winners were Ernoe Raffay in Szeged and Jozsef Debreceni
in Kecskemet. They were backed by the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
an alliance of political groups opposed to the ruling Communists.
   Raffay, a historian, defeated Karoly Miklos, a bus company
manager who was the candidate of the Communists' reform wing, and
Levente Dobozy, an independent. Raffay received 61.8 percent of the
votes, Miklos 22.5 percent and Dobozy 16 percent.
   Debreceni ran unopposed after the Communist candidate and
another rival dropped out following poor showings in the July 5
balloting.
   The evening newscast said Debreceni won 70 percent of the vote
but did not account for the remaining 30 percent.
   The report said 57 percent of the electorate cast ballots in
Kecskemet but did not give the turnout in the two other races.
   Leaders of the Communist Party made campaign appearances last
week to help the party's candidates _ with little success.
   At a rally in Kecskemet Wednesday, party chairman Rezsoe Nyers
said that although the elections would not determine the country's
political future, they could not be ignored because they marked the
beginning of a multiparty election system.
   Lutheran clergyman Gabor Roszik won 69.2 percent of the votes in
the July 5 by-election in Goedoelloe. He is considered to be the
first opposition figure to be elected to the National Assembly
since 1947, when the last completely free elections were held.
   Some non-communists won seats in 1985 under limited
multiple-candidate elections but all candidates had to have the
endorsement of the Communist-run Patriotic People's Front. That
stipulation has been removed.

<HEAD>New 50,000 Cordova Bill to Circulate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua will put a new
50,000-cordoba bill into circulation in an effort to keep up with
steady devaluations and five-digit inflation that has forced some
residents to carry bundles of money.
   Newspapers said Saturday that the new bill, worth about $2.50,
will begin circulated Monday.
   The announcement comes less than four months after the
government introduced the 20,000-cordoba note, the highest bill now
in circulation.
   Since the beginning of the year, the cordoba has dropped from an
official rate of 2,000 to the dollar to 20,000 to the dollar. The
last devaluation was in June, when it fell from 9,500 to its
current rate.
   Under a government austerity program this year, inflation has
dropped from a rate of 20,000 for 1988. The rate for the month of
July was 8.5 percent, according to official figures.
   However, prices on numerous basic products, including beans,
cooking oil and soft drinks have increased substantially in the
past few days.
   The new note carries the picture of Jose Dolores Estrada,
considered a national hero for his defeat of American adventurers
Byron Cole and William Walker and their militias on Sept. 14, 1856.
   On the reverse side, is the Hacienda San Jacinto, the scene of
the defeat.

<HEAD>Town Claims Hamburger Record With Patty for 10,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEYMOUR, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This farm town, which claims it invented
the hamburger, fried up a 5,520-pound patty Saturday and served it
to about 10,000 people in a bid for a spot in the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   ``It was nice and juicy,'' said Doris Witbrow of Suamico.
   The event at the Outagamie County Fairgrounds was a tribute to
Charles ``Hamburger Charlie'' Nagreen, who _ according to local
historians _ mashed a meatball to make the world's first hamburger
in 1885.
   About 50 cooks in aprons worked around a specially designed
grill 21 feet in diameter and heated by 12 gas burners. It took
about two hours to cook the 6-inch-thick layer of ground chuck.
   To avoid having to flip the patty, grill designers Steve Mielke
and Joe Sauer used a cover to cook both sides at once. A
truck-mounted crane lifted the cover into place and suspended Sauer
over the patty as he sprinkled salt.
   The burger was intended to serve 15,000 people, but the meat ran
out after an hour and 45 minutes and 10,000 diners. Five thousand
buns were left over.
   Seymour plans to submit its claim to the biggest burger to
publishers of the Guinness Book.
   According to the Guinness Book, the largest hamburger on record
weighed 5,005 pounds, 13.8 ounces and was cooked in Cape Town,
South Africa.
   Seymour, a town of 2,600 people 15 miles west of Green Bay,
disputes claims by other communities, including Hamburg, N.Y., to
making the first burger.
   According to local lore, the 15-year-old Nagreen was selling
meatballs from a booth at a fair when it occurred to him that
people could carry them more easily if the meat were flattened
between two slices of bread.
   The Appleton storekeeper died in 1951 after 65 years of hawking
hamburgers at county fairs.
   The grill used to cook Saturday's giant hamburger was bigger
than the patty, leaving space for a bigger attempt next year, said
Carl Kuehne, whose Green Bay Dressed Beef donated the meat.

<HEAD>Candidate Says He's Determined to Revive Scandal-Plagued Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race to be Japan's prime minister started in
earnest Saturday with front-running Toshiki Kaifu, joined by the
two other candidates on television, saying he was ``young,
energetic'' and determined to revive his scandal-plagued party.
   On Tuesday, the governing Liberal Democratic Party will elect a
new leader to become Japan's third prime minister this year. When
the nominations deadline passed on Saturday, there were three
candidates, none of them well-known or possessing a personal power
base.
   Kaifu, 58, is a former education minister whom analysts see as
strongly leading because he is backed by large factions in the
party.
   The other two candidates are Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, a former
welfare minister who called for more open politics, and Shintaro
Ishihara, 56, a former transport minister who comes from the
party's nationalist wing.
   One of them will replace Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who is
resigning to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat
July 23 in elections for the upper house of Parliament. Uno took
office June 2, succeeding Noboru Takeshita, who resigned in the
Recruit bribery scandal that has tainted most of the leaders of the
party.
   ``I am young, energetic and have power to act,'' Kaifu said in
an 80-minute televised news conference at which the three
candidates answered questions prepared in advance.
   They all said they favor party political reforms, continuing
Japan's ban on rice imports and reviewing the new 3 percent sales
tax that was a major factor in the party's steep decline in
popularity.
   They did not attack each other openly, instead often saying they
shared the previous speaker's opinion.
   Hayashi came close to attacking the front-runner by saying the
party's decision-making should become more ``easy to understand''
to win back the voters' trust. Hayashi's candidacy emerged after it
seemed there might be only one in the race _ Kaifu, the nominee put
forward by a combination of big factions.
   The party's 405 members of Parliament and 47 local
representatives vote in a secret ballot on Tuesday to elect a new
president.
   The party leader will be confirmed as prime minister Wednesday
on the strength of the Liberal Democrats' majority in the lower
house of Parliament, which chooses the head of government.
   But since the party lost its upper-house majority in the recent
election, the Liberal Democrats may face the embarrassment for the
first time of a Socialist-led majority in the upper house refusing
to endorse the winner from the lower house.
   While Hayashi said he was clear of any link to the Recruit Co.
conglomerate that is accused of trying to bribe politicians and
others, Kaifu has confirmed he received about $110,000 in legal
donations from Recruit over five years.
   Ishihara said Recruit had purchased $21,700 worth of tickets to
symposiums he organized. The money was returned to Recruit after
the scandal emerged, he said.
   Asked at the news conference about trade tension with the United
States, Ishihara said Japan should reject unreasonable U.S. demands
and blaming ``a lack of competitiveness in U.S. products'' for the
trade imbalance.
   Ishihara also attacked the government for agreeing to U.S.
demands to revise the agreement on joint production of a new
fighter plane for the Japanese air force. Japan could have built
the fighter itself, Ishihara said: ``Why should we accept such a
deal?''

   President Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and five Caribbean leaders on Saturday agreed to
strengthen relations between Latin American and the Caribbean and
pool efforts to fight drug smuggling.
   The leaders also agreed to press for an international conference
on Third World debt relief.
   The summit on this Caribbean island wrapped up a four-day state
visit by Perez to Trinidad and Tobago.
   On Friday, the Venezuelan leader and Prime Minister A.N.R.
Robinson signed agreements on trade and cooperation in the event of
an oil spill in the waters of the two oil-producing neighbors.
   The two met Saturday for four hours with prime ministers Michael
Manley of Jamaica, Erskine Sandiford of Barbados, James Mitchell of
St. Vincent and President Desmond Hoyte of Guyana.
   Robinson said late Saturday that the leaders agreed to
coordinate anti-drug smuggling efforts, encourage other Latin
American and Caribbean nations to strengthen relations between the
two regions and hold an international debt conference.
   He gave no further details.
   The six leaders arrived early Saturday in Trinidad's sister
island of Tobago, home to 44,000 people.
   Manley, Perez and Robinson, leaders of three highly indebted
nations, are strong proponents of reducing the debt burden of
developing nations.
   The summit was proposed during a July meeting in Grenada of the
13 leaders of the Caribbean Community, known as Caricom.
   Venezuela, separated from Trinidad by the eight-mile Gulf of
Paria, has formally requested observer status with Caricom.
   Robinson called the summit a ``meeting of the minds between
Venezuela and Caricom.''
   ``There is a strong need to expedite the integration process,
not only within (the Caribbean), but also between Latin America and
the Caribbean,'' Robinson said.
   Friday's agreements included Venezuela's extension of a $3
million line of credit to Trinidad, which reduced by 25 percent
tariffs on 12 Venezuelan products.

   Torrential rains flooded the streets of

in their cars, officials said.
   Firefighters said they rescued 150 to 300 people _ some by boat
_ from vehicles trapped in rapidly rising water in lower-lying
sections of Narbonne, a city near the Mediterranean and 530 miles
south of Paris.
   A fire brigade in Narbonne, quoting the national weather
service, said from 4 to 6 inches of rain fell Saturday afternoon.
Earlier reports had incorrectly put the downpour at 31 inches.
   After the downpour stopped, the waters receded and life quickly

<TEXT>
   Hiroshima halted for a moment of silence
early Sunday to mark the 44th anniversary of the first atom bomb
attack and to appeal for peace.
   As a single bell wailed and more than 1,000 doves were released
into the skies, 50,000 people gathered in Hiroshima's Peace
Memorial Park to mark the moment a U.S. B-29 bomber carried out the
world's first atomic attack.
   At 8:15 a.m., the precise moment when the bomb exploded in a
flash of blinding light on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima citizens,
Japanese government officials and visitors from throughout the
world bowed their heads in silent prayer while buses and streetcars
stood still throughout the city of 1 million.
   The heat, blast and radiation reduced to rubble and ashes a
large portion of the western city, a major military center during
World War II. About 140,000 people perished in the firestorm that
engulfed the city.
   ``Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic
attack, is determined that the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
should never be repeated,'' Prime Minister Sousuke Uno told the
crowd, many of whom were dressed in black under a sweltering sun.
   ``We strongly feel the duty to use Hiroshima to sound an alarm
bell for the future of all humanity. From now on, Japan must carry
out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and security in the
world,'' said Uno, who has announced he will resign the premiership.
   A group of visiting mayors, including Anne Rudin of Sacramento,
Calif., presented a large wreath of yellow chrysanthemums, the
traditonal mourning flower, to the victims of the bombing at their
official monument, a granite cenotaph in the center of the park.
   ``In my city we are learning that our strength as a nation does
not depend on military might but on economic strength,'' Rudin said
after the ceremony. ``A nation's greatness is not measured by the
evil it threatens but by the good it does.''
   Outside the ceremony, hundreds of boy scouts handed visitors
fresh flowers while protesters handed out leaflets criticizing
alleged government laxity in preventing U.S. warships from bringing
nuclear weapons into the country contrary to government policy.
   Korean residents of Japan distributed pamphlets demanding the
government apologize for its aggression against fellow Asians in
World War II and other conflicts.
   At the memorial service, 4,244 names of those exposed to the
bomb who died in the last year were added to the names enshrined on
a tablet in the cenotaph.
   Although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly
related to the bomb, researchers believe the risk of death from
leukemia, and lung, breast and bone cancer is greater for those
exposed to the bomb than for those who were not.
   Three days after Hiroshima, the United States dropped a second
atom bomb on the coastal city of Nagasaki, killing another 70,000
civilians. Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945,
ending the war.

<HEAD>Report: Pierce Aided Former Law Firm While Directing HUD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Samuel R. Pierce Jr. helped his former law firm gain access to
government officials even though he had promised otherwise,
according to The New York Times.
   The Times said in Sunday editions that while Pierce may not have
broken the law or directed anyone on his staff at HUD to act
improperly, he regularly did personal favors for former colleagues
at the firm.
   The newspaper quoted several lawyers at Pierce's former firm,
Battle, Fowler of New York, as saying Pierce acted ethically,
considering he was a former partner and close friend.
   Documents obtained by the Times under the Freedom of Information
Act raise ``additional questions about Secretary Pierce's
management at HUD,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., whose
subcommittee is investigating allegations of abuse and
mismanagement at the agency.
   At Pierce's confirmation hearing on Jan. 13, 1981, Sen. Jake
Garn, R-Utah, then chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, asked Pierce, ``I understand you will sever your
ties with your law firm; is that correct?''
   Mr. Pierce replied, ``That is correct.''
   The Times said Pierce helped the firm gain access to officials
at other government agencies.
   Documents show that Pierce ordered subordinates to investigate
problems that Battle, Fowler was having obtaining HUD financing,
the newspaper said.
   There was no evidence that applications were approved as a
result, the Times said.
   The help Pierce gave his old law firm began within weeks of his
confirmation as secretary in January 1981 and continued through
much of his tenure, the newspaper said.
   Pierce also received monthly pension payments from the firm
between January 1981 and January 1988 that totaled $234,485, the
Times said.

attached to the telephone of Italy's top Mafia investigator, and
newspapers said Saturday his phone had been tapped.
   Interior Ministry technicians discovered the wire after four
days of searching the office of Giovanni Falcone, a magistrate who
has provided key information in U.S. Mafia cases and has become a
symbol of Italy's war on the crime syndicate.
   Newspapers speculated that the purported phone tap had provided
information used in an assassination attempt against Falcone in
June.
   ``At the moment, we have only confirmed a suspicious situation,
an irregular wire that parts from the line and ends at a telephone
switchboard,'' Police Commissioner Ferdinando Masone said Saturday.
   He denied reports that a tiny tape recorder had been found near
the phone.
   The Rome-based daily La Repubblica said investigators also
discovered that someone had opened the phone outlets in Falcone's
office and tinkered with the machinery.
   The reports of phone-tapping came a day after Premier Giulio
Andreotti told Parliament that organized crime had become ``a true
national emergency'' and proposed giving increased powers to state
security agents.
   Police have been examining how assailants learned Falcone's
schedule on June 20 and set up a bag of explosives in the water in
which he planned to take a swim. Security guards spotted the
waterproof bag in time.
   Falcone won fame for his work with an aggressive anti-Mafia
group of magistrates. He persuaded mob figure Tommasso Buscetta to
testify, a breakthrough that led to a major organized crime trial
resulting in the conviction of 338 people in 1987.

<HEAD>Thousands of Twins Gather at Annual Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,800 sets of twins decided to
double their pleasure Saturday by attending the 14th annual Twins
Days Festival in this aptly named city.
   Organizers estimated that 50,000 people attended the first day
of the two-day event. More twins were expected to arrive Sunday,
with about 2,500 expected during the affair.
   Fifty-two contests were held to determine, among other things,
the twins who traveled the farthest to attend, those who look most
alike and least alike, and dozens of other attributes in various
age groups. The same 52 contests were to be repeated Sunday.
   President Bush sent a letter to festival organizers that was
reprinted in the program for the event.
   ``As grandparents of two beautiful children who are twins,
Barbara and I know that everyone attending this festival has
wonderful stories to share,'' Bush wrote. ``We wish you a most
enjoyable celebration.''
   The festival was begun to honor Aaron and Moses Wilcox, who
settled in what was then called Millsville in the early 1800s. The
Wilcox brothers were lifetime business partners, married sisters,
held all of their property in common and died of the same illness
on the same day.
   In 1817, they asked that the town's name be changed to
Twinsburg. In exchange, they donated six acres that now serve as
Twinsburg's town square, and gave $20 toward starting the town's
first school.

   A balloon deflated and plunged about
2,000 feet to the ground Saturday night at the National Hot Air
Balloon Championships, killing its lone occupant as thousands of
spectators watched.
   Robert Mock, 52, of Paonia, Colo., died at Our Lady of the Lake
Medical Center about an hour after the 5:55 p.m. accident, said a
nursing supervisor who refused to give her name.
   The cause of the accident was not known, but witnesses said
Mock's balloon suddenly deflated, burst into flames and plunged to
the ground.
   Jim Birk of Defiance, Ohio, director of the championships,
denied eyewitness reports that Mock's balloon _ the Chariot of
Fire, Too _ caught fire after deflating. He said people on the
ground might have mistaken flames from the balloon's burner for
accident-related flames.
   ``It is apparent that the burner was operated by the pilot until
he was about 75 feet above the ground,'' Birk said.
   Mock apparently turned the burner off at that point to prevent a
fire on impact, he said.
   Mock told his ground crew by radio that the flaps on his balloon
were loose, and he apparently tried to compensate by pumping more
hot air into the balloon, said East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's
Capt. Robert Shorter.
   ``At that point, the balloon collapsed and he plunged
approximately 2,000 feet,'' Shorter said.
   About 45 balloons were in the air at the time, Birk said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board were investigating the accident.
   The FAA tightly regulates the sport and inspects balloons
annually or after each 100 hours of operation, just as the federal
agency checks conventional aircraft, Birk said.
   Parachutes aren't required and a fire extinguisher is the only
safety equipment carried in gondolas.
   ``At many times, there is little the pilot can do to retard a
fall,'' he said.
   Documents showed Mock's last in-flight certification was April
2, 1988, and his balloon was last inspected on Dec. 1, 1988. Birk
said Mock's balloon had been deemed airworthy.
   Up to 10,000 people may have seen the accident at the Greater
Baton Rouge State Fairgrounds, Shorter said.
   Saturday was the second day of the gathering of hot-air
balloonists. The championships end Aug. 13. It was the first fatal
accident in the national championships' 19-year history, Birk said.

<TEXT>
   A three-judge federal panel has refused
to stop the establishment of a single governing board for
Louisiana's 17 colleges, the key part of a court-ordered
desegregation plan.
   ``It is high time that higher education in Louisiana be reworked
at all levels in a unified effort to improve the education offered
in this state to all Louisiana citizens,'' the court said Friday in
an opinion issued in New Orleans.
   The panel last month ordered Louisiana to replace four governing
boards with one in a package of sweeping reforms to desegragate the
state's 17 public colleges and universities.
   The judges ruled the present system ``has perpetuated illegal
segregation.''
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the U.S.
Justice Department.
   Currently, one board governs the Lousiana State University
system, another governs the mostly black Southern University system
and a third governs the others. All three boards answer to the
State Board of Regents for Higher Education.
   State Attorney General William Guste, who had asked to court to
overturn its decision mandating the single board, said he would
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In a motion filed in New Orleans on Thursday, Guste said the
state Constitution calls for four governing boards and the federal
court ``can't change the state constitution unless it is patently
unconstitutional.''
   The new board has been ordered to restructure the higher
education system beginning Aug. 18.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has appointed the board's 17 members, and
Senate confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin Aug. 14.
   The court on Friday also rejected a request by the Southern
University Board of Supervisors, the Justice Department and the
Grambling State University Alumni Association to put in the ruling
specific amounts the state must spend to improve programs at
predominantly black Southern and Grambling.

   An Afghan guerrilla leader said
Saturday his fighters killed 11 members of a rival guerrilla
organization and captured 30 during a battle in northern
Afghanistan last month.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the fundamentalist Pro-Islam Party,
made the comment at a news conference. His version disputed reports
by the rival Party of Islam that five of its members were killed
and 25 were captured and then slain on July 9.
   It was Hekmatyar's first public appearance since the fight
between the rival guerrilla factions.
   Mohammad Shaoib, a spokesman for the Party of Islam, said July
18 that Hekmatyar's followers killed five Party of Islam members in
the July 9 ambush and killed 25 who were taken prisoners. He said
among the dead were seven Party of Islam field commanders.
   Other rebel sources said the Pro-Islam Party and Party of Islam
were engaged in a power struggle that hindered efforts to overthrow
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed Marxist government.
   The Bush administration, responding to the July 9 killings, said
it deplored the action but its support to the Afghan rebels would
continue.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for Hekmatyar's guerrillas,
said at the time that some Party of Islam guerrillas had been
killed in the battle but denied the reports of killings afterward.
   Hekmatyar said Saturday that 11 Party of Islam guerrillas were
killed while 30 were seized and ``are being held captive and are
still alive.'' He did not give conditions for their release.
   Hekmatyar said his fighters ambushed the Party of Islam
guerrillas because they had repeatedly attacked his local
headquarters in northern Takhar province.
   He called the battle a ``local, regional conflict'' and not a
war between the two parties.
   Party of Islam leader Burhanuddin Rabbani has said Hekmatyar's
faction should be suspended from an ``interim'' government
proclaimed by seven rebel factions based in Pakistan.
   Hekmatyar's group has received a major portion of millions of
dollars worth of military aid supplied by the United States and
channeled through Pakistan.
   Hekmatyar, who holds the title of foreign minister in the
6-month-old interim government, indicated he would boycott the
alliance if elections aren't held by Aug. 10.
   He said elections throughout war-ravaged Afghanistan and in
refugee camps in Pakistan were essential to stop internal fighting
among the rebel factions.
   ``It (elections) would kill the tendency toward armed clashes,''
he said. ``This is the only way of putting an end to our problems.''
   Guerrilla leaders formed the interim government during a series
of meetings in February in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
   Hekmatyar joined with the condition that it hold elections
within six months.
   ``Elections would include other parties, provide a legitimate
body to draw up a constitution, dispense with tribal prejudices and
prevent internal fighting,'' Hekmatyar said through an interpreter.
   He called on Afghan army units to stage a coup with the rebels'
help and set up a ``revolutionary council'' to oversee nationwide
elections.
   It appeared that Hekmatyar made the proposals to try to counter
growing criticism. He and his party have been accused by other
rebel groups of seeking to dominate the alliance.
   Marxist army officers seized power in Afghanistan in a 1978
coup. The Soviets ended more than nine years of military
intervention to help the government when it completed the
withdrawal of troops on Feb. 15.
   The Kremlin continues to back the government with military and
economic aid.

   Millions of American women who have had
abortions will be urged to join the national debate on the issue
when the U.S. Supreme Court takes it up again this fall, an
attorney told fellow lawyers Saturday.
   Women will not return ``to a form of enslavement'' caused by
making abortion illegal, Margie Pitts Hames, an Atlanta attorney
who handles abortion-related matters, said during a panel
discussion of abortion at the American Bar Association's annual
convention.
   Hames said groups around the country are working to mobilize the
25 million women who have had legal abortions in the United States.
   A standing-room-only crowd of about 150 people, mostly women,
attended the debate by four attorneys, two Hawaii legislators, a
journalist and a historian.
   In a ruling last month, the Supreme Court issued a ruling
allowing states to restrict abortions.
   Panelists agreed that the ruling signaled dramatic changes in
abortion rights and regulations, but could not agree what those
changes were.
   Hames said the public debate would be shifted as women and their
partners spoke up to demand a right to make their own decisions.
   However, Paige Comstock Cunningham, staff counsel for Americans
United for Life, said Americans are rethinking their sense of
morality on two issues: ``What is wrong with the world now and what
do we want the world to look like?''

   Flooding washed away a house, forced the evacuation of a trailer
park and closed roads in Vermont on Saturday as thunderstorm winds
up to 85 mph downed trees, power lines and telephone service in the
Midwest.
   Lightning killed an Ohio man north of Cincinnati, and a falling
tree injured a child after a funnel cloud reportedly touched down
briefly 25 miles southeast of Columbus, on Saturday night,
authorities said.
   In Wisconsin, the Coast Guard searched Lake Michigan for a
stranded boat believed to have two people aboard. In Oklahoma,
severe thunderstorms packing winds up to 70 mph tore the roofs off
buildings in Bartlesville. No injuries were reported.
   The storms appeared to be the remnants of Hurricane Chantal,
which washed ashore in Texas last week, the National Weather
Service said.
   An overnight storm dumped up to 5 inches of rain on parts of
central Vermont. Plainfield, 12 miles east of Montpelier, was the
worst hit.
   One home was washed away by the rising Great Brook.
   Several stretches of road connecting Plainfield and the
neighboring town of Orange remained flooded, state Rep. Peter
Youngbaer said at an emergency town meeting.
   ``There are several families in there, who are isolated between
washouts,'' he said. ``One of the priorities is to figure out a way
to get emergency vehicles in there if they're needed.''
   Plainfield sits astride the confluence of the Great Brook and
the Winooski River. Yards along the brook were 6 inches deep in
silt and were strewn with debris, residents said.
   At the River Run Trailer Park in Berlin, the Stevens Branch,
another Winooski tributary, overflowed its banks. Dozens of
residents were forced to flee waist-deep water, state police said.
   The river receded by noon and residents returned to their homes.
   Main Street in nearby Barre was 6 to 8 inches deep in water for
a time, and several businesses' basements were flooded. A car was
seen up to its door handles in water.
   Roads were washed out or closed by mudslides in East Montpelier,
Northfield, Moretown and East Middlebury.
   A musician at King's Island amusement park north of Cincinnati
was struck by lightning about 6 p.m. as he made his way to his car
during a thunderstorm, said Bill Mefford, manager of marketing
communications for King's Island.
   The victim, Thomas Cahall, 39, of Covington, Ky., was a member
of a Dixieland band hired to entertain guests at the amusement
park, Mefford said.
   Another man, Dean Blosser of Urbana, was struck by lightning
while in Columbus, fire officials said. Blosser was listed in
extremely critical condition at St. Ann's Hospital, hospital
officials said.
   A church in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Carthage was heavily
damaged in a three-alarm fire that started as the thunderstorm
began, and a portion of the roof of an apartment building in nearby
Fort Mitchell, Ky., was blown off by high winds, officials said.
   In Oakland, Ohio, residents reported a funnel cloud, said
Fairfield County Sheriff's Deputy Luke Danner.
   ``We've got trees and power lines down virtually all over the
place,'' Danner said.
   The extent of the child's injuries was not known.
   In addition to the homes reported damaged by high winds, several
fires, probably electrical, were reported, Danner said. None of the
fires appeared to be serious.
   In Iowa, severe thunderstorms packed winds up to 85 mph, pelting
cities and farm fields with hail and leaving a trail of broken
trees, damaged buildings and power outages that affected more than
15,000 customers.
   In western Iowa, about two-thirds of an inch of rain were
accompanied by winds that stripped leaves from corn stalks, blew
down part of a barn and knocked down tree limbs near Little Sioux.
   ``Clouds came in rolling over each other, the sky turned black,
the wind came up and the garbage cans took off,'' said Gina Duncan,
a convenience store clerk in the central Iowa town of Boone.
   Winds hit 75 mph in Wisconsin, where powerful thunderstorms
knocked out electrical power to about 15,000 residents and stranded
the boaters.
   The overnight storms flooded many streets and caused problems on
Lake Michigan.
   The Coast Guard belives the missing 18-foot boat might have been
blown out on the lake.
   Winds as high 75 mph were reported in surburban Milwaukee on
Friday night.
   Thunderstorms and high winds did similar damage in Nebraska and
Indiana.

<TEXT>
   Journalists from the Soviet Union and
the United States ended a conference by stressing the need for more
``citizen diplomacy'' between the superpowers.
   ``Twenty bridges are better than one,'' Nickolai Reimers, editor
of Science and Life Journal in Moscow, said on the last day of the
five-day conference Friday.
   ``If we paired people up by interests, paired up the exchanges,
it would be a new step,'' Reimers said through a translator.
   The conference at Connecticut College, sponsored by the New
England Society of Newspaper Editors and the Union of Soviet
Journalists, brought together nine Soviet journalists and nine from
the United States.
   ``We need more depth of exchange,'' said Viachislav Pohvalski,
editor of Zaporozhskaya Pravda in Moscow. ``It is part of a
citizens' diplomacy, which is more important than the official
diplomacy.''
   Reimers said he would like to see the two organizations set up
permanent teams of journalists to work together on stories and
projects all over the world.
   Steve Riley, editor of the Central Maine Morning Sentinel in
Waterville, said he corresponds with a Soviet newspaper editor, and
the two papers exchange news stories and columns, but have not been
able to arrange a visit. He agreed it would be a major step forward
if individual exchanges could take place.
   Sergey Runov, a member of the board of the Union of Soviet
Journalists, said the two groups could hold joint seminars and
lectures and swap journalists. Such an exchange, he said, would
allow people could learn the truth about each nation, not just the
propaganda.
   Even without exchanges, the groups have made progress in thawing
Soviet-American relations, said Bernard Caughey, an editor at the
Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass.
   ``We have a saying in the United States,'' Caughey said. ``It is
better to light one little candle than to curse the darkness. We've
been at this a long while. I'd like to think we lit a few of those
candles, and you in return lit candles. It has been worth the
effort.''
   Journalists from both nations discovered they had similar
problems in trying to obtain information for stories.
   One Soviet journalist said not everyone welcomes perestroika,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program, and said the
Soviet media has been criticized for playing a large part in
opening the government up to examination and question.
   Maura Casey, an editorial writer with The Day in New London,
said the most valuable aspect of the conference was meeting Soviet
counterparts.
   ``All the stereotypes I grew up with are meaningless when you
look into a person's eyes,'' she said.

<UNK>Agreement Allows Visa-Free Trips Between Alaska, Soviet Far East</UNK>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the United States and
the Soviet Union have endorsed agreements permitting visa-free
travel for natives of northwest Alaska and the Soviet Union's
Chukotsk Peninsula.
   The agreement reached Friday in Washington will become official
when it is signed by Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, possibly as early as
September, said an aide to Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
   The agreement also establishes a commission of three Soviets and
three Alaskans to help deal with minor incidents, emergency
evacuations and search and rescue operations, said Murkowski aide
Jessica Gavora.
   Murkowski said the agreement is the most significant development
yet in a 2-year-old thaw between Alaska and the Soviet Far East
territories across the Bering Strait.
   In Alaska, natives who live on St. Lawrence Island, the Seward
Peninsula or in the Kotzebue area and have cultural or family ties
with the Soviet Far East are expected to qualify for visa-free
travel, Gavora said. Trips could last up to 90 days.
   The federal government would determine who could go and would
compile lists to be placed at border checkpoints.
   Travel would be confined to border regions.
   Alaska natives used to travel across the Bering Strait by
motorboat to exchange walrus skins and sable fur. They returned
with flour, sugar, tobacco and underwear from Soviet trading posts.
   The agreement permitting the trips was terminated in 1948 as the
Cold War chilled relations between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   With the easing of border tensions in the past two years, Soviet
and Alaska Yupiks have renewed contacts. Last month, Bering Air of
Nome began a charter service to transport groups back and forth
across the Bering Strait.

   Parents whose young son apparently
suffered brain damage after taking aspirin six years ago on Friday
lost their $50 million lawsuit against two drug companies and two
distributors.
   A Superior Court jury said the apparent injury to Larry A. Bunch
Jr. could not be linked to aspirin he took in 1983 at age 9 when he
had chicken pox.
   Shortly after taking the aspirin, the boy became seriously ill
and slipped into a coma. He regained consciousness, but apparently
suffered brain damage, according to medical testimony in the
monthlong trial.
   Parents Larry and Isabel Bunch sued Sterling Drug Co., the maker
of Bayer Aspirin; Rawson Drug and Sundry Co., which manufactures a
generic aspirin; and distributors Whitworth Inc. and Norwich-Eaton
Pharmaceuticals.
   The parents' attorney, Robert Davis, said he hadn't decided
whether to appeal the decision.
   Reye's syndrome, which causes liver and brain inflammation, has
been linked to aspirin. Defense attorneys argued successfully that
the boy suffered from hepatitis or encephalitis not caused by
aspirin.

   The administration on Friday voiced optimism, tinged with

Rafsanjani, to help find a solution to the hostage situation.

   Congress sent a landmark savings and loan
bailout to President Bush early today after a frantic two days of
wrangling over the finishing touches on the biggest financial
rescue in history.
   The House passed the $159 billion legislation shortly after
midnight Friday on a 201-175 vote, allowing weary members of
Congress to begin a monthlong vacation that had been threatened by
a bitter fight with the administration over the financing of the
package.
   House Democrats abandoned the bill in large numbers after key
congressional negotiators bowed to a veto threat by Bush and agreed
to hide 60 percent of the bailout's cost from the federal deficit.
   But with the losses of government-insured deposits mounting at a
rate of $20 million to $30 million daily, House and Senate leaders
from both parties _ with vigorous personal lobbying by Bush over
the telephone _ put together enough votes to replenish an insolvent
S&amp;L insurance fund with $50 billion.

explosion was preparing an attack on British author Salman Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 14, when the
late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said his novel
``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and called on Moslems to
kill the author.
   Scotland Yard said a man was killed Thursday as he worked with a
handmade explosive charge inside a London hotel near Paddington
Station.
   The statement from a group calling itself the Organization of
Islam's Mujahedeen did not identify the man, which it said was the
group's ``first martyr.''

   Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu and two veteran
politicians from the ruling party today applied to run in next
week's election to choose the third prime minister in Japan this
year.
   Scandals involving bribery and sex have forced Noboru Takeshita
and his successor, Sousuke Uno, from office prematurely.
   While the 58-year-old Kaifu remains the front-runner, some party
leaders complained that he had been selected in backroom factional
manuevers. Offended by those wanting reform pledges, two party
veterans announced at the last minute Friday that they would
challenge Kaifu.
   All three put in nomination papers shortly before the deadline
this morning at the headquarters of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, which holds a secret ballot Tuesday to elect a
successor to Prime Minister Uno.

   The source of future paychecks is uncertain, but
musicians of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra believe the show must
go on.
   ``You've got to think optimistically,'' trumpet player Bill
Lucas said. ``Not being paid is a big thing. But it takes a lot to
get here, and it wouldn't be the first time I didn't get paid.''
   The orchestra, regarded as one of the nation's top 10, is
verging on collapse with an $8 million deficit. If not for a recent
$1 million state appropriation, the symphony already would have
closed.
   Without $18 million in donations, bankruptcy court is the next
step for the 75-year-old orchestra, Chairman Robert S. Miller Jr.
said.

   National anti-drug director William J. Bennett
is targeting drug users to get them to quit, and he says he'll use
arrests, fines and public embarrassment.
   A draft of Bennett's national drug strategy, obtained Friday,
says he wants drug users to lose their driver's licenses, their
cars, their federal grants.
   And he wants them to get treatment, even if they don't want it,
saying, ``It is time to reexamine the premise that voluntary drug
treatment should continue to be the mainstay of our treatment
system.''
   The strategy calls on states to ``consider expanding the use of
`civil commitment,' whereby addicts are sent by the courts to
residential treatment facilities. Upon their release, they are
required to participate in carefully monitored outpatient
programs.''

   Open with a shot of the sun setting on a
steamy Mississippi River town. Cut to a smoke-filled room.
   A ceiling fan turns slowly as corrupt cops, officials on the
take and greedy politicians discuss shakedowns, kickbacks and
under-the-table deals. As a B-grade movie it might play, but
Louisiana officials say it isn't reality.
   They believe they've cleaned up whatever image problems the
state's film industry had as a result of last year's indictments of
two New Orleans police officers, an employment office worker and
the former director of the state film commission.
   ``Filmmaking is big business and it's a growing business in
Louisiana, but there was no doubt that the state had an image
problem for a while,'' said Tisa Laviolette, director of the
Louisiana Film and Video Commission.
   Those indicted were accused of funneling jobs to a favored few
when movies, TV shows or commercials were made in Louisiana. When
the stories hit the trade publications in Hollywood, they did not
go unnoticed, said Ron Neter, unit manager for one major movie shot
in New Orleans.
   ``Sure, people talked about it,'' he said. ``It was the only
incident of that kind I ever heard of. The situation was dealt
with, though. I think the fact that the state brought the people to
trial showed that they won't allow that sort of thing.''
   The indictments came after shooting the hit Dennis Quaid movie,
``The Big Easy,'' which was ironically about police corruption in
New Orleans. There were two acquittals and one conviction in 1988,
and numerous cases were put on hold, with no trial dates likely to
be set.
   Since then, moviemaking moved ahead full steam in the state.
   In the last year, Albert Finney and a horde of machine-gun
carrying gangsters took over New Orleans streets in the
prohibition-era ``Millers Crossing.'' Paul Newman portrayed former
Louisiana Gov. Earl Long and cavorted with a stripper in the movie
``Blaze.'' And ``The Blob'' oozed its way through the little town
of Abbeville for a remake.
   Dale Pollock, the producer of ``Blaze,'' admitted to being a bit
leery of Louisiana's reputation before coming to the state.
   ``We had heard that some of the film commissioners had been
indicted and the teamsters in Louisiana have always had a tough
reputation,'' he said.
   ``I had some doubts about what we would be asked for or if
people were going to want something slipped to them under the
table. We haven't come across anything like that, however. The new
film commission is working to make sure no one gets that impression
of the state from now on.''
   ``Miller's Crossing,'' ``The Blob'' and ``Blaze'' poured $128
million into the depressed Louisiana economy in 1988, Laviolette
said.
   ``Out of that amount, I'd say there was $40 million in cold hard
cash left behind in Louisiana. A very conservative estimate is that
it has an economic impact of $120 million by the time it turns over
in the community, and I think we could double that figure.''
   The slogan of the commission is ``Shoot the other LA,'' and
people are listening, she said. ``In the last few years, filmmaking
in Louisiana has really gone up. We normally averaged seven films a
year shot here. In 1988 we did 14 and 1989 looks equally
promising.''
   Even though 42 states have film offices and actively compete for
business, California remains the film leader of the United States,
with New York close at its heels.
   Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outside
California. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferred
to California's patchwork approach, where local governments issue
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70
years old.
   And the long-held belief that Hollywood could recreate anything
from the Tara plantation in ``Gone With the Wind'' to the Las Vegas
Strip in ``One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakers
who want greater realism.
   Louisiana lures film companies with locations that include the
French Quarter, swamps, plantation homes and small-towns.
   ``We have the architectural styles we needed within a very tight
radius,'' said Neter, unit manager on ``Miller's Crossing.''
   Joel and Ethan Coen, who directed and produced ``Miller's
Crossing,'' considered San Francisco, Portland and North Carolina
as settings before choosing New Orleans.
   ``The film is set in 1929,'' Neter said. ``It's not specified as
taking place in New Orleans; it's an unidentified city. We wanted
that look, though, the architecture and ambiance of the time, and
we found it here. We've shot all over town, I'd say 30 locations,
and it's been great.''
   Another consideration for choosing Louisiana was to have a
location where they could shoot in the winter and not have snow.
   ``It's worked out absolutely great,'' Neter said. ``For a film
crew that has to be away from home for three to six months, New
Orleans certainly offers a lot in cultural and epicurean
opportunities that make your off hours more enjoyable.''
   ``We like to think of it as one-stop shopping for filmmakers,''
said Kimberly Carbo, who acts as liaison between the city agencies
and filmmakers. ``We try to meet the needs of the people filming
and minimize the problems it will cause local residents.''
   Laviolette said Louisiana is beginning to get repeat
performances _ filmmakers returning to make other movies.
   ``I think it is because of the positive experience they have
working in Louisiana as well as the other things we offer,'' she
said.
   Despite budget problems plaguing the governor and the
legislature, Laviolette plans to ask for a $49,000 increase to
build an aggressive advertising campaign.
   ``There are a lot of commercials, movies and television
productions shot outside of New York and California. I want more of
them shot in Louisiana,'' she said. ``People here are not only
enamored with the movies, they're beginning to realize what big
business it is.''

<HEAD>Defining The Recession Animal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The summer pastime of economists and others who
try to anticipate the future is whether the economy is headed for a
soft landing, a recession or neither.
   Opinions are as varied as the grains of sand on the beach or the
shape of the clouds or the bubbles in a drink, and for the
practical purposes of most ordinary people it matters not a whit
who is right.
   Recessions come and go. No free-market economy has ever been
without them for long. They are an economic pulse, preceding and
following expansions. They are in the nature of free-market
economies, like colds are to humans.
   They might come from unexpected events, such as catastrophes or
shortages; or from economic mismanagement, such as misinformed
money-supply policies; or simply because when times are good people
push things to the extreme.
   Whether a recession technically occurs isn't of vast importance
to most people. More significant by far is the extent of the
downturn in terms of jobs and job security, wages, profits and
prices.
   Technically, a recession occurs when gross national product
declines for two successive quarters. But it is possible for this
to occur without being noticed by the ordinary working person or,
in fact, by entire geographic areas.
   Consider: It is a slowdown, not a recession, if economic
expansion slows but grows by a fraction of 1 percent for two
successive quarters, but it is a recession if the economy shrinks
by a fraction for two quarters in a row.
   Other criteria are considered too, but past recessions usually
have been identified by the two-quarter theory.
   Especially important to the ordinary person is the length of a
recession or a slowdown. Some are V-shaped; the decline is quickly
followed by an upturn. Some are U-shaped. And some are long and
level as a summer horizon.
   Is a quick, corrective recession any worse than a prolonged
downturn that doesn't qualify as a recession? Stagnant economies
that stumble along the plus side of the recession-expansion line
might be more destructive.
   There's a geographical aspect to recessions too. Technically,
the nation's economy can be described as in recession with some
regions enjoying good times. Or, the numbers can show it to be
healthy when many areas are desperately ill.
   The latter, in fact, occurred earlier this decade when states
dependent on oil, mining and agriculture simultaneously suffered
economic woes for different reasons.
   At one time in that period an economic research organization,
Sindlinger &amp; Co., measured 33 states in recession. Offsetting their
depressing effect on the national statistics were coastal areas
with expanding economies.
   There is also some evidence that recessions today need not be
quite what they used to be, due in part, perhaps, to more informed
economic management and maybe to the emergence of a global economy.
If the domestic consumer economy is weak, for example, it might be
offset by exports to a strong foreign economy.
   Some economists like to refer to ``rolling readjustments''
rather than recessions. The term is euphemistic to some extent, but
the rationale may be sound. Moreover, it seems to be supported by
some recent experiences.
   Whatever, these economists believe it is less likely today than
yesterday for most industries to go down together, and more likely
that a recession will roll through the economy, affecting different
industries at different times.
   Recessions can be all-inclusive or selective. They can be
extended or brief. They can be deep or marginal. They can be
accompanied by price increases or decreases. They can be
significant or relatively unimportant.
   Not all of the species is savage. While you might not like to
make a pet of any recession, some of them are quite tame.

<HEAD>Bass Bolstered Future Prospects by Going Back to Basics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When G.H. Bass &amp; Co.'s former corporate parent
finally found a buyer for its shoe manufacturer in 1987, prospects
for Bass looked so bleak that the new owner got a bargain.
   Today, the 113-year-old Bass is winning back a following after
rescuing its reputation for quality and updating its traditional
styles.
   Bass was on the block when the British-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever acquired Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., which had owned
Bass since 1978.
   No eager buyers rushed forward because the American footwear
industry was being crushed by foreign competition and Bass looked
like it lacked the market toehold to wage a successful fight.
   ``Bass had done nothing but struggle from 1983 to 1987,'' says
John Thorbeck, the current Bass president. ``During this time, Bass
was a prominent example of how a domestic manufacturer was under
great pressure, and at the same time was dealing with its own
misdirection and mismanagement.''
   American shoe manufacturers in the early 1980s had to adjust to
radically changing American tastes in shoes while coping with an
influx of imports.
   Orderly marketing agreements with South Korea and Taiwan
controlling U.S. imports of non-rubber footwear _ meaning virtually
all types of shoes _ were allowed to expire under the Reagan
administration. At the time, the two countries were major foreign
suppliers of everything from tennis sneakers to dressy pumps.
   Imports surged. By 1986, imported leather and plastic shoes had
expanded to about 1 billion pairs from 520 million in 1981, said
Peter T. Mangione, president of the Footwear Distributors and
Retailers of America.
   The supply went to satisfy a burgeoning demand for athletic
shoes; the jogging craze evolved into the aerobics fad, both of
which were part of a bigger fitness movement that has influenced
consumers' shoe selections ever since.
   ``The driving factor in the footwear market in this country is
fashion and the athletic trend drove this market for the last
decade,'' says Mangione.
   In such an environment, a company like Bass known for
conservative, sturdy leather lace-ups and loafers wasn't where it
was at.
   ``Nobody was crazy about traditional Bass Weejuns,'' Thorbeck
says of the shoe, named for its Norwegian inspiration, that debuted
in 1936. ``These were the years when Nike and Reebok were becoming
billion-dollar companies. The casual shoes were being swept aside
by the Nike and Reebok hurricanes.''
   During those troubling years for Bass, which had been a private,
family-owned business for most of its history, the firm branched
out in directions that turned out to be the wrong ones.
   It introduced Bass Air, a line of athletic shoes that flopped.
It imported a line of women's shoes from Brazil and the quality was
so poor that every retailer returned its shipments to Bass. It
neglected to advertise or place marketing emphasis on its hand-sewn
leather moccasins and other shoes. With cost-cutting in mind, it
allowed quality to slip.
   Most of Bass's U.S. factories were shuttered, leaving only one
in Wilton, Maine, and one in Puerto Rico. The company lost $46
million on sales of $150 million in 1986.
   The next year Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., famous for making and
marketing women's and men's apparel, particularly shirts, bought
Falmouth, Maine-based Bass for $79 million, well under its book
value of $130 million.
   Thorbeck, formerly with shoe company Timberland Co., says when
he was brought in by Phillips-Van Heusen in November 1987 he felt
Bass needed to reassert its identity after mistakenly ignoring its
own strengths for too long.
   Bass decided to win back affluent consumers, those willing to
pay around $100 for a pair of loafers. It took a targeted
advertising approach and placed 12-page promotional pitches in the
upscale magazines Vogue and GQ.
   Some early successes under the new ownership helped restore the
company's confidence. Contemporary versions of some of Bass's old
favorites appealed to retailers, who probably were looking for shoe
lines to satisfy nostalgia-mad grown-up baby boomers. Saddle shoes
and buckskins were enjoying renewed popularity within some yuppie
circles
   ``In one season we proved ourselves as traditional yet
contemporary,'' says Thorbeck. ``We were hitting on all cylinders
by the fall of 1988.''
   Some of Bass's recent updating touches have proved timely. The
company capitalized on the demand for so-called status sneakers
this spring by bringing out a version of the canvas, rubber-soled
shoe swith brass eyelets, leather-padded trim and leather laces.
Instead of selling a projected 30,000 pairs in the first year, Bass
now thinks it will sell 400,000 pairs.
   Bass has concentrated on a relatively small selection of
retailers, including department stores Bloomingdale's, Marshall
Field and Nordstrom.
   It doesn't sell to discounters at all and controls the markdowns
on its merchandise by offering reduced-price shoes at outlets.
These Bass-owned stores are carefully located in areas with
numerous factory outlets that attract bargain-hunting tourists.
   Bass has returned to profitability. It earned $16 million in
1988 on sales of $180 million and expects to report significantly
better results for 1989.
   A Bass catalog has been brought out, with clothing to complement
the shoes.
   Thorbeck says he's pleased with the prominence retailers are
giving Bass in their shoe departments.
   Phillips-Van Heusen has given Bass management leeway to develop
its own strategy.
   ``One of the advantages of a company that was in this poor shape
was we could sweep through changes without much hesitation,'' says
Thorbeck. ``We went back to what we knew best and we reinterpreted
it for a contemporary customer.''

<HEAD>Junk Bond Market Prepares For Fallout From S&amp;L Order to Divest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The junk bond market is preparing for the
fallout from a requirement that savings and loans sell their
holdings in these high-yield, high risk investments as part of the
congressional thrift bailout bill.
   Some industry watchers say the elimination of savings and loans
as a market for junk bonds could depress junk bond prices and make
it more expensive for companies to float new high-yield issues.
   ``It is a significant pool of capital that has now been cut off
from the high-yield market. Of course that's going to restrict any
market,'' said Greg Scott, executive vice president of the Alliance
for Capital Access, a trade group for junk bond issuers.
   Others say the ban on thrift junk bond holding may not have a
major impact.
   ``While thrifts are important junk bond investors, they don't
comprise an enormous percentage of buying power,'' said John J.
Kriz, an assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
   Kriz said other factors affecting the junk bond market at the
time the thrifts sell their holdings may mitigate the effect of the
sales. Among these factors are interest rates and how many new junk
bond issues are floated.
   Other industry watchers say it's premature to say what effect
the bailout bill's provision would have.
   The provision was approved by a House-Senate panel late last
month. It would give thrifts five years to sell their junk bond
holdings, so there probably wouldn't be a wholesale dumping of the
bonds at once.
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's
largest trade group, said it did not lobby against the junk bond
requirement because only about 175 of the nation's 2,900 savings
and loans invest in the bonds.
   Of the 175, 10 held about 70 percent of the $4.1 billion in junk
bonds owned by the industry in the first quarter, said James Grohl,
a senior vice president for the trade group.
   The Alliance for Capital Access put the total junk bond
investment by thrifts at about $14 billion. Whichever figure is
correct, the investment is still a small fraction of the
approximately $200 billion junk bond market.
   The Alliance's Scott says the loss of thrifts as junk bond
buyers would be especially troubling because it has been a
fast-growing market for the bonds. Thrift investments in junk bonds
have doubled since 1985, he said.
   But, he added, there are other juicy markets for junk bonds that
have barely been penetrated, such as the life insurance and mutual
fund industries. Of the approximately $1 trillion in assets of life
insurers, less than 1 percent is invested in high-yield securities.
   Scott said the ban on thrift junk bond holdings may have a
psychological impact on the market, forcing junk bond issuers to
increase the yields of the bonds, which already are substantially
higher than Treasury bonds. But Scott said he expected the impact
would be temporary.
   The savings and loan legislation provides a loophole for thrifts
that want to keep their junk bonds. Under the bill, they may form a
separately capitalized affiliate and sell their junk bonds to it.
But Scott said few thrifts would have the financial wherewithal to
set up such a subsidiary.
   Junk bonds are so named because they are rated as non-investment
grade, or speculative, by the credit rating firms. Because of the
higher risk of default, they pay more interest to holders than
investment-grade bonds.
   Junk bonds are issued by companies that already are deep in debt
or otherwise cannot obtain an investment-grade rating. They also
are used to raise cash for corporate takeovers.
   The Alliance for Capital Access stands by the soundness of junk
bonds as investments. Scott said he believes the divestment
provision of the bailout bill was motivated in part because the
bonds are used for hostile takeovers and because thrifts were using
federally insured deposits to invest in them.
   ``The debate was driven by emotion, not facts,'' Scott said.
   The pioneer and biggest booster of the junk bond market, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., also opposes the divestiture requirement.
   ``No thrift has ever failed because of their investment in high
yield bonds,'' said spokesman Steven S. Anreder. ``We feel this
action will only serve to restrict access to capital by small and
medium-size businesses.''

<HEAD>Stocks Shrug Off Recession Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk of a possible recession may frighten
politicians and business planners, but it doesn't seem to scare
investors in the stock market these days.
   The word came up with increasing frequency this past week when
the Commerce Department reported that its index of leading economic
indicators had declined for the fourth time in the last five months.
   After more than 6{ years of expansion, many analysts said, the
chances looked increasingly high that business activity was headed
into a slump.
   Yet stock prices held their ground at or near record highs,
after finishing off July with one of their strongest monthly gains
ever.
   ``Historically, the leading economic indicators have peaked four
to six months before the economy has turned down,'' observed Suresh
Bhirud, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``Stock prices typically have peaked four to six months before
the leading economic indicators turned down.
   ``So what's happening this time around? Stock prices should have
peaked about six months ago but haven't, making for considerable
confusion among strategists and economists alike.''
   That isn't the only disparity giving forecasters fits. Unlike
stock market investors, bond traders lately have been behaving as
though a recession were very close at hand.
   Before they suffered a setback on Friday, bond prices had risen
dramatically in recent weeks, pushing interest rates downward in
apparent anticipation of slack credit demand and a business slump.
   Despite all that, however, optimists on the economic and
financial outlook argue that it is unwise to try to argue with the
stock market.
   ``We suspect that when the last 21 months take their place in
the history books, it will be under the title `What Didn't
Happen,''' said Jay Donnaruma at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``We did not have a recession, the dollar didn't go to parity
with the yen, inflation didn't go to the moon and stocks didn't go
to zero.
   ``One of the most fascinating aspects of this rally is that
people are still not euphoric or even very enthusiastic. We suspect
that when a large dip does come, it will be caused by too much good
news.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,653.45, up 18.21 from the week before.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 1.26 at 191.64; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 4.60 at a record 457.42, and the
American Stock Exchange market value index up 1.59 at 376.10.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 182.43 million shares a day,
against 179.62 million the week before.
   Whenever the stock market has looked vulnerable to a setback
this year, a new corporate takeover story seems to have come along
to revive it.
   That has helped extend a dominant theme of the 1980s _ a
shrinking supply of stock available to investors. ``The continuing
shrinkage of the supply of equities is playing a major role in this
market,'' said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   At some point, in theory at least, stock prices could get high
enough to drive away takeover bidders.
   Though that day may be getting nearer, contends John Connolly at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., it is not yet at hand.
   ``Clearly, rising prices have now precluded a number of
potential deals,'' he said, ``but the possibilities still seem
rather abundant.
   ``With huge pools of capital anxious to be deployed and armies
of investment bankers with lifestyles to support, the continuing
shrinkage of equity should keep pushing stock prices higher.''

   The word racketeer has acquired some new meaning
in the high-living financial world, and it's not a name for the guy
who strings tennis rackets at the country club.
   To a half-dozen securities professionals convicted in New York
and 46 futures traders indicted in Chicago under a tough law aimed
at fighting organized crime, ``racketeer'' is like the ghost of Al
Capone, a stigma that could plague them for the rest of their lives.
   If anyone in the lucrative business of buying and selling
stocks, bonds and commodities still had any illusion they were
somehow exempt from prosecution under this law, they likely were
sobered by the events of this past week.
   Of particular significance were the New York convictions in the
so-called Princeton-Newport case, based on what many attorneys had
called confused and even flimsy evidence of fraud.
   This showed with dramatic certainty that juries will convict
Wall Streeters under the racketeering law. It's an ominous sign for
similar defendants facing trial, especially Michael Milken, the
ex-junk bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who faces far
more serious charges.
   The Princeton-Newport case concerned a now-dissolved investment
firm called Princeton-Newport Partners. Five of its members and
another ex-Drexel trader were accused of creating phony tax losses
via prearranged securities trades.
   Two days after the Princeton-Newport verdicts, prosecutors in
Chicago announced long-awaited indictments stemming from a lengthy
undercover probe of alleged fraud in the world's largest
commodities markets.
   Again using the racketeering law, prosecutors accused the 46
defendants of turning the trading pits into their own private clubs
where they reserved the best deals for themselves and tossed the
dregs to unsuspecting clients.
   Both the Chicago and New York prosecutions represent an
aggressive application of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organization Act or RICO, as it's commonly called. It was enacted
by Congress nearly two decades ago to combat gangsters.
   The law is considered one of the most powerful enforcement tools
ever enacted in this country, enabling prosecutors to seize a
suspect's assets before trial and providing for crippling fines and
lengthy prison terms upon conviction.
   Despite criticism from many lawyers that the law is excessive,
its application has expanded over the years to prosecutions of
criminal defendants ranging from union bosses to motorcycle gangs
to politicians.
   The RICO acronym, also the name of the Capone-like mobster
played by Edward G. Robinson in the 1930 film ``Little Caesar,''
was coined by one of the law's authors, G. Robert Blakey, a Notre
Dame law professor.
   ``RICO means crime is called by its correct name,'' Blakey once
said. ``If people are running a racket, why shouldn't we try them
for being a racketeer?''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Convoluted economic reports sent confusing signals into the
financial markets. The Commerce Department said its chief
forecasting gauge fell 0.1 percent in June, the fourth drop in five
months and a strong signal of a slowdown. But the Labor Department
said unemployment dropped in July, suggesting the economy is
growing stronger.
   _Alleged sleazy business practices hurt the reputations of the
nation's largest drug chain, charge-card company and home-shopping
network. Rite Aid Corp. and its president were indicted on charges
they tried to bribe an Ohio regulator. A top executive at American
Express Co. resigned for his role in trying to discredit a rival
international banker through a smear campaign. Home Shopping
Network Inc. was slammed with a $100 million defamation verdict for
falsely claiming GTE Corp. telephone mismanagement hurt its sales.
   _In the takeover business, investor Irwin Jacobs knocked on Avon
Products Co.'s door with a $2.85 billion offer but the cosmetic
giant rejected it; and Amax Inc. agreed to buy Canada's
Falconbridge Ltd., in a $2.4 billion deal that would create one of
the world's largest metal producers.
