<HEAD>Federal Panel Rejects Mass. Request to Reopen Seabrook Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal regulatory panel rejected a
request by Massachusetts' attorney general to reopen an inquiry
into training at the Seabrook nuclear project because of problems
during low-power testing.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board on Thursday ruled that
Massachusetts officials had not proven that the June 22 shutdown at
the plant presented a significant safety issue.
   ``The decision reaffirms what we've said since the incident,''
Ron Sher, spokesman for plant operator New Hampshire Yankee, said
Friday.
   Sher said it ``was an isolated situation with no safety
significance, and we took immediate, decisive action to address the
causes of the incident and will continue to ensure safety and
excellence in all plant operations.''
   Seabrook is completed but lacks federal permission to operate
commercially. Plant officials expect to get a license by the end of
the year.
   The utility delayed shutting down the plant after a valve
malfunctioned, despite the urgings of Nuclear Regulatory Commission
inspectors in the control room. Federal and state officials later
criticized control room personnel for the delay.
   New Hampshire Yankee promised that the problem would be
corrected.
   Massachusetts officials argued that the event demonstrated that
plant operators and management ``lack adequate managerial and
administrative controls to operate the facility at any level of
power.'' They argued that a new hearing on a full-power license was
needed because of the relationship between low-power and full-power
operation.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon has been an
outspoken foe of the plant.
   The federal panel said no evidence was presented to raise
legitimate doubts about Seabrook and safety procedures.
   The panel also concluded that the June 22 incident didn't pose a
safety threat and was an aberration. The delay in shutting down the
reactor ``resulted from a narrow omission in training'' and a
misunderstanding, the panel wrote in its decision.

   A tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico showed signs
of growing into a hurricane Friday, threatening to swamp coastal
areas already facing abnormally high tides and prompting the
evacuation of offshore oil rigs.
   Tropical Storm Jerry, which developed rapidly from a tropical
depression off the Mexican coast on Friday, had maximum sustained
winds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity, according to
the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur, Texas, to
the mouth of the Mississippi River. A hurricane warning for
portions of the watch area was likely to be issued Saturday.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday, the center of Jerry was located at
24.5 north latitude and 93.6 west longitude, or about 425 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans, and moving north at 13 mph.
   Oil companies began evacuating offshore rigs and platforms early
in the day, officials said in New Orleans. More than 4,000 workers
in the gulf were to be be brought ashore by helicopter and ship.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' said Wendy
Jacobs of Shell Oil. ``Everyone knows you don't take any chances
with these.''
   The hurricane center advised Gulf Coast residents and marine
operations to closely monitor advisories on the storm.
   ``At the moment, Louisiana appears to be in the greatest danger,
but the storm could turn over the weekend,'' said forecaster
Gilbert Clark. A coastal flood watch was issued for the Texas coast.
   Rough seas from Jerry also may coincide with an unusual
astronomical phenomenon that is expected to elevate average tides
to a 10-year high, said Clark.
   The moon, which raises tides with its gravitational pull, will
be both full and at its closest point to the earth next week. In
addition, the moon's orbit is over the Northern Hemisphere, which
adds to its affect on the seas.
   Clark said tides could be up to a foot higher in the Gulf and
more in the open ocean.
   ``A situation likes this happens about once every decade,'' he
said. ``But it also has the reverse affect. Low tides will be at
their lowest.''
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds
hit 74 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to
November.

<HEAD>Popping the Question: Researchers Study Why Some Popcorn Kernels
Are Duds</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Ran first for Saturday AMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   College researchers are popping a mountain
of corn to glean a kernel of information _ how come there are
always a few unpopped duds at the bottom of your bowl.
   In what must be one of the best-smelling laboratories anywhere,
University of Illinois researchers periodically pop 5 to 6 pounds
of research popcorn an hour for several hours, then analyze the
kernels that are too pooped to pop.
   The brand used is that created by Orville Redenbacher, the
entrepreneur who gave this snack-for-the-masses panache when he
touted his popcorn as gourmet quality. Redenbacher's parent
company, Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc., of Fullerton, Calif.,
gave the school $45,000 to conduct the research.
   ``The volume of this industry is so larg that even small
improvements make a significant impact on profits,'' researcher
Bruce Litchfield of the College of Agriculture said earlier this
week.
   Americans consume about 13 billion quarts of popped corn
annually and the industry has been swelling at a rate of about 5
percent a year.
   There are two key quality factors in popcorn: total pop volume
and the number of kernels that do not pop.
   ``We are interested in finding out more about how we can breed
the corn for better popability, how we can harvest it to avoid
damage to the kernels, and how we can store it to maintain the
right percentage of moisture,'' said Kay Carpenter, spokeswoman for
Beatrice-Hunt Wesson, itself a subsidiary of Chicago-based BCI
Holdings Corp.
   Redenbacher's popcorn, packaged for both stovetop and microwave
preparation, is the market leader. Research produced the
high-quality brand, and research will lead to further improvements,
said Ms. Carpenter.
   ``He bred his corn to pop fluffier and to have a more tender,
less chewy, texture. But unpopped kernels were his real pet
peeve,'' she said.
   When the popcorn arrives from the Redenbacher facility in
Valparaiso, Ind., it is stripped from the cob mechanically.
Researchers pop it in a movie theater popper, measure the volume
and dump it onto a screen, where unpopped kernels fall through for
counting.
   More than 800 pounds have been popped in the name of science
since the project began in March. Some of the data is eaten on the
spot, but much of it is given to a local elementary school, said UI
food engineer Steve Eckhoff.
   Kernels pop when heat turns internal moisture into steam,
creating pressure that bursts the outer shell. The pressure cannot
build in kernels with cracked coatings, so they either don't pop or
pop only partially.
   Factors that influence a kernel's popability is damage to the
shell when it is stripped from the cob, and too much or too little
moisture, Eckhoff said.
   Researchers have identified two techniques to loosen kernels
from the ears before stripping. One is preconditioning cobs by
changing temperature and humidity; the other is using an enzyme to
help break the bond between kernel and cob.
   Corn that has been mechanically shelled has twice as many
unpopped kernels as hand-shelled corn, and less total pop volume,
he said.
   Still, there are usually no more than 30 duds _ called UPKs in
the trade, for unpopped kernels _ in a jar of 4,000 kernels of
high-quality popcorn.
   That may sound too paltry to study, but as Eckhoff said: ``A UPK
doesn't mean much until you bite down on it.''

   A network television news crew arrived in Boston
this week to do a special report on urban fires and quickly found
firefighters battling a Chinatown blaze that was one of the city's
worst in several years.
   ``We've done stories with police around the country where they
say, `Gee, you should have been here last week,''' said Eric
Engberg, a correspondent for the CBS program ``48 Hours.''
   ``This is a case when last week was this week,'' he said.
   The firefighting report, scheduled to air later this month, will
look into fire issues around the country, including arson and
forest fires. Producers picked Boston for a segment on urban fires.
   Engberg said the first fire for the news crew came Wednesday
night, but then on Thursday they followed firefighters to a blaze
in the city's Chinatown section.
   The fire caused an estimated $2 million in damage and became a
downtown spectacle as flames filled a six-story building and
ignited nearly 2,000 pounds of illegal fireworks, setting off
thunderous explosions.
   ``This fire is going to be the star of the show,'' Engberg said.
   Fire officials said a cutting torch used to dismantle a
sprinkler system illegally appeared to have caused the fire. They
said they were trying to determine who cut off the sprinkler system
and who stored the fireworks.
   More than a dozen people suffered minor injuries as a result of
the fire, but no one was seriously hurt, officials said.

   Stocks tumbled and the Dow Jones industrial
average plummeted nearly 191 points Friday in the deepest plunge
since the crash of 1987, battered by fears that the takeover fever
driving up prices may be over.
   ``It's total emotional and psychological chaos,'' said analyst
Eugene Peroni of Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ``People
are dumping everything. ... A great deal of money is being lost.''
   Brokers said the drop was triggered primarily by news that a
labor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed
$6.75 billion takeover of United Airlines parent UAL Corp.
   Acquisition of the company would have relied largely on the sale
of high-risk ``junk bonds,'' commonly used to finance takeovers
known as leveraged buyouts.
   ``The UAL announcement means the problems in the junk bond
market are spreading,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at
First Albany Corp.
   ``It means that it's going to be difficult _ even impossible _
to finance acquisitions and leveraged buyouts,'' he said.
``Leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stock prices
this year ... and if that prop gets removed, stocks would have to
go down.''
   Brokers said computerized selling strategies that can dump
stocks on the market accelerated the plunge, the same scenario that
preceded the 1987 crash.
   At the closing bell, the widely watched Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks had plunged by 190.58 points to 2,569.26, by far
the biggest drop since the 508-point crash on Oct. 19, 1987. Other
stock indices also fell sharply.
   The figure represented a drop of 6.91 percent in the Dow, but
still was the 12th largest percentage decline on record. Until
Friday, the worst Dow drop this year occurred March 17, when the
index lost about 48 points.
   The speed of the decline on Friday the 13th spooked traders who
were reminded of the epic stock panic nearly two years ago to the
day. More than 250 million shares changed hands and nearly $200
billion in stock values were wiped out.
   ``Nobody believes in witchcraft, but we're seeing the same type
of phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago,'' said
Washington economist Michael Evans.
   Dazed financial workers poured out of their offices into the
canyons of Wall Street assessing the damage and making comparisons
to 1987.
   The plunge triggered panicky trading in the currency markets and
sent the dollar's value sharply lower.
   Bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe haven
in the credit markets. Interest rates, which drop when bond prices
rise, dropped to their lowest levels since April 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement that
the decline ``should be viewed in the context of a 591-point rise
since Jan. 1, 1989.'' He said the drop ``doesn't signal any
fundamental change in the condition of the economy. The economy
remains well balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate
growth.''
   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, who took office earlier this week, had no comment. The
Federal Reserve also had no comment.
   President Bush, leaving the White House for the weekend at Camp
David, ignored shouted questions from reporters about the plunge.
   New York Stock Exchange President Richard A. Grasso said
safeguards put in place after the 1987 debacle helped soften the
blow from Friday's drop.
   ``All of the safeguards and the coordination procedures that we
developed in the last two years were utilized today and worked
exceptionally well,'' Grasso said.
   Problems in the risky junk-bond market were exacerbated last
month when Canadian retailing giant Campeau Corp. announced it was
unable to make payments on some of the bonds it issued in its
buyouts of Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Skittishness has sharply curbed investors' appetite for junk
bonds, so named because of their low credit ratings, just as a
large number were to be sold by the end of the year. Prices of junk
bonds dropped for the 17th straight day Friday.
   The UAL news ``seemed to trigger a selling panic,'' said analyst
Hildegarde Zagorski of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. UAL, the
second-biggest airline in the country, is part of the Dow
Transportation index.
   The casualties included companies currently involved in takeover
fights and firms that have already won their battles. Among the
hardest hit was Time Warner Inc., which is in the process of
completing its $14 billion acquisition of Warner Communications
Inc. Time Warner skidded $11.25 a share to $131.75, American
Airlines parent AMR Corp., which faces a $7 billion takeover bid
from developer Donald Trump. AMR slipped 12{ cents from Thursday's
close to finish at $98.62{ a share.
   Other observers said news from the Labor Department that
wholesale prices rose sharply in September suggested inflation was
heating up again, reducing the likelihood the Federal Reserve would
act to ease interest rates.
   The Dow's decline reverberated in Canada, where stock prices
suffered their worst decline in two years. The key 300-share
composite index at the Toronto Stock Exchange, the only foreign
market open during Wall Street's plunge, lost 141.69 points to
close at 3,870.74 to conclude what had been a quiet session.
   The fallout is expected to continue, beginning late Sunday U.S.
time, when foreign markets reopen, beginning with New Zealand and
Australia and followed by Japan, Hong Kong and European markets.
   In New York, the market had been gradually retreating throughout
Friday's session, with the Dow off about 23 points at 2 p.m. EDT.
But a tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100 points
in little more than an hour amid news the UAL deal had run aground.
   The drop was eerily reminiscent of a 108-point Dow drop on a
Friday exactly two years ago, which proved to be a harbinger of the
century's second stock market disaster on the following Monday _
Oct. 19.
   Zagorski said she did not expect the events of 1987 to be
repeated. ``It's not going to go down too much further from these
levels,'' she said shortly before the market closed.
   Peroni, however, said such a severe drop on a Friday is cause
for particular concern. ``It's bad because it means that there's
going to be two days for fear to fester'' before investors have a
chance to trade again Monday.
   Following the 1987 crash, regulators imposed what they called
``circuit breakers'' on the Dow that would automatically limit
trading if the index rose or fell 50 points. The restriction was
later expanded to 250 points as part of a coordinated program with
other stock and futures markets.
   But confusion over the rule was rampant Friday. ``Nobody seems
to be clear on where the circuit breaker is,'' Peroni said. ``If
there is one, it certainly is failing.''
   In Chicago, similar circuit breakers went into effect for the
first time Friday when trading in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures on
the Mercantile Exchange was halted after the December contract fell
the limit of 12 points.
   Trading resumed after the required 30-minute halt, but the
contract fell the limit again and trading ceased once more before
the market was to close.

   A videotape produced by the community college
in Jacksonville, Fla., is helping show latchkey children how to
fend for themselves until their parents get home from work.
   A college in Denver is teaching parents of 40 troubled
schoolchildren to read in English to their children. The kids are
doing better in school.
   In Cleveland, the downtown Metro Campus is working with the
Playhouse Square organization to bring brown bag lunch
entertainment to office workers.
   The programs are described in a report made public Friday by an
organization that says they show community colleges in big cities
are doing more than just teaching classes. The report was released
by the Commission on Urban Community Colleges of the American
Association of Community and Junior Colleges.
   ``They are dealing with what I believe to be the very difficult
issues of our times and in many ways go beyond their original
mission and in some sense go beyond what many of us would consider
routine or traditional higher education,'' said Maurice D.
Weidenthal, director of the commission's Urban College Project and
author of the report.
   ``This is not the old campus school for the elite. This is for
youngsters who are at risk,'' said Roscoe Brown Jr., president of
Bronx Community College of the City University of New York.
   Wiedenthal, a former education editor of the Cleveland Press,
visited 10 urban community college campuses.
   ``The study found these campuses to be feisty, solid centers of
learning, with educational images relatively unscathed by the
disappointing performance of nearby school systems or the decay of
surrounding neighborhoods,'' he wrote in this week's issue of the
Community, Technical and Junior College Times.
   The average age of community college students is 30, said Dale
Parnell, president of the association, who said the schools are
getting many people attending the two-year colleges to train for
new jobs.
   Alfred A. DelliBovi, undersecretary of housing and urban
development, attended the commission's press conference and said
community colleges are important to the economies of cities.
   ``When you look at the future of America, which we believe is
going to be one of growth and revival in the cities, there is going
to be a need for training for those new jobs we think are going to
be created,'' he said. ``They require new skills. It's the
community colleges that are right there on the cutting edge
providing those skills.''
   Asked why the Department of Education was not represented at the
news conference, Parnell said: ``They have not taken any interest
in urban education.''
   Lon Anderson, a spokesman for the Education Department, asked
about Parnell's remark, said, ``The facts do not support that
statement in any way, shape or form'' because ``we are doing so
much to focus on at-risk children and inner-city education.''
   Anderson said Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos plans to
visit East Harlem on Monday and Tuesday to attend a conference on
choice in education.
   The schools covered in the report are Bronx Community College,
New York; Miami-Dade Community College, Fla.; Cuyahoga Community
College, Cleveland; Florida Community College, Jacksonville; Penn
Valley Community College, Kansas City; El Centro College, Dallas.
   Also, Los Angeles City College; The Community College of Denver;
The Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh; and Wayne
County Community College, Detroit.

   A collection of books and pictures of the former
Ottoman Empire fetched $4.5 million at a three-day auction, nearly
double the pre-sale estimate, Sotheby's said.
   The auction that ended Friday included nearly 5,000 books,
manuscripts, drawings and photographs on the Ottoman lands of
Turkey, Greece, Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, the auction
house said.
   The highest price was $110,800 for 12 watercolors depicting
views of Constantinople _ the former name of Istanbul _ and the
Bosporus strait. The pictures were published in 1790 and were drawn
by Clara Mayer, daughter of a German or Austrian diplomat.
   The Ottoman Empire, which formed in about 1300, came to an end
in 1920 with the formation of the Turkish republic.
   Sotheby's said the auction was expected to realize about $2.3
million. The collection was owned by U.S. banker Henry Myron
Blackmer II, who died last year.

   About 200 water buffaloes raced across
a dirt square and competed in a beauty contest during the
traditional Buffalo Racing Festival.
   Hundreds of people watched the festivities in Chonburi Province
near the capital Friday.
   The day began with about 10 groomed buffaloes pulling bright red
wooden carts decorated with bananas, coconuts and palm leaves.
Their horns were polished and they were adorned with flowers for
the beauty contest.
   In a dirt square about the size of a football field, buffaloes
raced against buffaloes, then against motorcycles. Their owners won
electric fans and other prizes.
   The festival stems from ancient celebrations honoring the
buffalo.

   Former House Speaker Carl Albert was
honored as a national leader in the defense of civil rights and
promotion of education who never lost touch with the common folks
back in his native Oklahoma.
   Tears came to the retired congressman's eyes when he got up to
thank his host, former Oklahoma Gov. George Nigh, and Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla.
   ``I am so proud that they have associated their remarks with
me,'' Albert said.
   Albert, 81, a native of Bugtussle, Okla., served in Congress
from 1946 to 1977, and was Speaker of the House from 1971 to 1977.
He was saluted Friday at a luncheon at Central State University.
   Boren said Albert influenced him to go into public service and
counseled him as a young congressman.
   ``After having met with world leaders, Carl Albert never
changed,'' Boren said. ``He still kept up with people in Bugtussle.
He never left spiritually the community that he grew up in.
   ``He never confused his position with his responsibility,''
Boren said.
   Albert once said he drew his greatest satisfaction from his
efforts on behalf of civil rights and education, Boren said.
   ``I am not surprised that Carl Albert would select those two
areas,'' Boren said. ``They are something that is so fundamentally
American.''

   Jewish families throughout Israel gathered in
huts with thatched roofs and decorated with fruits and paper
trimmings to celebrate the eight-day Sukkot festival.
   The holiday, which began at sundown Friday, celebrates the
biblical exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt and their 40-year
journey through the desert to the Promised Land. The huts, or
``sukkahs,'' serve as a reminder of the shelter God provided the
Israelites, according to the book of Leviticus in the Bible.
   Tens of thousands of Jews also were expected to make a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem in accordance with religious tradition, and
police increased patrols to prevent violence in the holy city.
   Traditionally, Jews eat and sleep in the sukkah, even in cold
and rainy weather. The rooftop must be made of branches and leaves,
leaving enough open space to see the sky.
   Sukkot also marks the last harvest before the winter rains. The
holiday ceremony includes the gathering and waving of the ``four
species'' _ palm, myrtle, willow and citron _ which symbolize God's
bounty and blessings.
   Most government offices and some private companies in Israel are
closed during the holiday, and many shops are open only in the
mornings. Schools are closed, and some families take short
vacations.
   Many hotels, resorts and restaurants set up sukkas to
accommodate customers.

   The National Endowment for Democracy won't
give money to a Costa Rican political organization because of
questions about the congressionally-funded organization's role in
partisan politics.
   Keith Schuette, president of the National Republican Institute
for International Affairs, the NED's Republican wing, said Friday
the funding for the group ended in July. But he defended the
support for the group, which has strong ties to Costa Rica's main
opposition party.
   ``We view and the endowment views this as within the mandate of
what we've been approved to do,'' he said.
   President Bush will visit Costa Rica later this month for
celebrations marking 100 years of democracy there.

running for president, say the endowment over the past three years
``helped finance opposition party attacks against Costa Rica's
President Oscar Arias and his Nobel Prize-winning peace plan.''
   According to the papers, obtained by The Associated Press, the
endowment backed ``a front organization for the opposition Social
Christian Party.''
   ``There's a fine line here about what is legal. And if it wasn't
illegal, then it certainly was inappropriate,'' Castillo said.
   Arias repeatedly refused calls from the Reagan administration to
take a more active role in denouncing the leftist Sandinista
government in Nicaragua. His peace plan also was cited by Democrats
in Congress as the reason for voting down administration-supported
aid for the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   The papers said and Schuette confirmed that the Association for
the Defense of Costa Rican Liberty and Democracy received $450,000
over three years from the endowment.
   ``It is ironic,'' the papers assert, that the head of the group,
Rafael Angel Calderon, ``was the recipient in his previous
presidential campaign of $500,000 from Panama's dictator, Gen.
Manuel Noriega.'' The papers cited congressional testimony by Jose
Blandon, a former Noriega aide, for that contention.
   Calderon is a presidential contender for the February elections.
   The National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit organization
that receives congressional money, was created in 1983 ``to
strengthen democratic institutions around the world through
non-governmental efforts'' and normally does not finance political
parties or candidates.
   ``We are not allowed to become involved or support a candidate
or campaign,'' Schuette said. Exceptions were made in Grenada,
following the 1983 incursion, and in Nicaragua, with support for
the Conservative Party in 1984.
   The Bush administration has been seeking endowment funds for
Nicaragua's political opposition coalition for February's election.
   Schuette, in a June 5 letter to Carl Gershman, endowment
president, said the Costa Rican program would be changed to avoid
the appearance of impropriety.
   ``While these charges are absolutely untrue,'' he wrote, ``the
re-emergence of such questions at this time is obviously cause for
concern.''

   Jessica McClure's family doesn't have any
special plans to celebrate her rescue from a well two years ago,
but their hometown plans to give an award to a city that has
rallied to someone's aid the way Midland did.
   ``I'm fine,'' the 3{-year-old girl said in a brief phone
conversation Thursday night.
   As a toddler, Jessica caught the nation's attention when she
became stuck in a well 22 feet underground. Rescuers struggled for
58 hours to get her free before succeeding on Oct. 16, 1987.
   Jessica doesn't suffer from nightmares or claustrophobia today,
and she walks normally even though her right little toe and the tip
of her right big toe were amputated after the ordeal, said her
father, Chip.
   ``She has no memory of the incident whatsoever,'' he said,
adding that she still gets a sympathy card or two each day.
   The closest thing to an anniversary celebration will be the
announcement of the Midland Community Spirit Award, an annual honor
for a city that has responded to a person or group in need. The
award is unlikely to be ready by Oct. 16 because the judging of
more than 70 entries was incomplete, said Mayor Carroll Thomas.

   Jane Pauley says she's looking forward to
life after ``Today,'' but the co-anchor of the morning show
declined to say just what she expects to do for NBC's news division.
   ``My horizons have expanded,'' the 13-year ``Today'' veteran
told a group of women managers in a speech Friday. ``It's no longer
Jane Pauley, `Today' show. Now it's Jane Pauley, NBC News. Imagine
the possibilities.''
   Pauley's future has been the subject of speculation since NBC
``Sunrise'' anchor Deborah Norville, 31, moved up to ``Today'' as
news anchor in August, swapping duties with John Palmer.
   The 38-year-old Pauley, who is paid $1.2 million a year and has
two years left on her contract, told The Washington Post earlier
this week she intends to stay with the network, but will probably
leave ``Today'' by the end of the year.

   Comedian Andrew Dice Clay was
arrested for trespassing at a restaurant after the owner, who
accused him of causing a ruckus there earlier, tried to kick him
out, authorities said.
   Clay was arrested early Friday at the Ben Frank Restaurant after
refusing the manager's demands to leave, Sheriff's Deputy George
Ducoulombier said.
   The manager, who wasn't identified, made a citizen's arrest and
deputies booked the 32-year-old comedian from New York City. He was
released after promising to appear in court Nov. 3 on the
misdemeanor charge.
   The manager accused Clay of causing a scene at the eatery
several years ago, the deputy said, but he didn't have specifics.
Clay recently was banned from MTV after he swore during a live
televised broadcast of the MTV Video Music Awards.

<HEAD>Former GSA Chief Says Pierce Meeting Led to Grant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel investigating abuses at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development has received its
strongest allegation yet that former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce
took a direct role on behalf of politically connected developers.
   Former General Services Administrator Gerald Carmen testified
Friday that he met only with Pierce _ once a former colleague of
his _ in seeking tax credits and rental subsidies to develop an
apartment rehabilitation project in Arlington, Texas.
   About six weeks after the meeting in Pierce's office, Pierce's
executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, and then-Federal Housing
Commissioner Thomas Demery approved Carmen's 316-unit Pebble Creek
project for funding.
   But the approval in a March 4, 1987 memo occurred more than a
month before the local Arlington Public Housing Authority even
filed an application to HUD, according to agency documents.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday the paper trail and
Carmen's testimony contradict Pierce's statement to the
subcommittee last spring that he took no part in project decisions.
   ``I don't want to concede that, although I do concede that's the
way it looks,'' Carmen told Lantos' House Government Operations
employment and housing subcommittee.
   However, Carmen added, ``I'm a little surprised at the way it
went and I find myself a little uncomfortable at the position I'm
in now.''
   Carmen's testimony occurred in the 20th subcommittee hearing
that Lantos had held over six months into influence peddling,
mismanagement and alleged fraud at HUD during the eight years
Pierce was a member of President Reagan's Cabinet.
   In his last appearance before the subcommittee in September,
Pierce cited his Fifth Amendment rights on self-incrimination and
refused to answer any questions. The panel has subpoenaed Pierce to
testify again later this month and in November.
   In his testimony, Carmen acknowledged the Texas project has
already returned $800,000 in profits to him through up-front tax
credits although he put up no money of his own.
   At the time, Carmen said, he saw the 316-unit Pebble Creek
Moderate Rehabilitation Program project as an opportunity to both
``make money and do some good'' by providing rent-subsidized
housing to poor people in Arlington.
   Formerly a Manchester, N.H., businessman, Carmen worked with
Pierce during the transition between the Carter and Reagan
administrations after the 1980 election. Carmen was a member of
Reagan's transition team for HUD, and Pierce was named to be the
department's secretary.
   Carmen was appointed to head the General Services
Administration, which is responsible for building or leasing most
government offices and acting as a supply officer for much of the
federal bureaucracy. He held the GSA post until 1984, when Reagan
named him U.S. ambassador to United Nations agencies in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   As in other cases where projects were pushed by Washington
insiders, local Arlington officials were unaware of the potential
for the apartment project before he approached them, Carmen said.
   Pebble Creek was developed as a limited partnership between
Carmen and Joshua Muss, a law partner of Carmen's daughter.
   Carmen and Muss used HUD guaranteed mortgages to borrow $8.2
million _ $4 million for buying a rundown apartment complex and $4
million to upgrade it _ and sharing in $2.4 million in up front tax
credits plus $1.8 million in annual HUD rent subsidies.

   A convicted killer who held a female
doctor hostage for 10 hours in a prison infirmary Friday was shot
to death by sheriff's deputies who stormed into the room,
authorities said.
   Kenneth James Meller, 48, was shot after the officers tossed a
concussion grenade into the office and rushed in. ``Meller made
some sort of move. He's dead,'' said Terry Hubert, a spokesman for
the Northern Nevada Correctional Center.
   Hubert added that Dr. Karen Gedney was ``a bit stunned by the
grenade'' but otherwise unharmed.
   Prison officials said that during the ordeal, Meller talked
about committing suicide on Saturday, exactly 14 years after he
shot and killed a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper following a bank
robbery.
   State Prison Director Ron Angelone said Meller didn't threaten
Dr. Gedney ``until the end. As it was going downhill, he said that
if anyone showed his face he would hurt her. At that point we
decided to go in.''
   Larry Henry, Gov. Bob Miller's press secretary, said he was told
that the deputies rushed into the doctor's office through a door
and a window.
   ``The plan was to isolate the man from the woman. They tried to
catch him, there were a couple of shots, and he got hit,'' Henry
said.
   The decision to storm the room followed lengthy negotiations
with Meller that involved Warden Brenda Burns, Angelone and the
local sheriff, Paul McGrath.
   Meller had gone into the medium-security prison's infirmary
about 10 a.m., scuffled with staffers and then took Gedney hostage,
saying he was thinking about killing himself.
   Prison officials said Meller had a 4-inch knife. Prison
spokesman Glen Warton said earlier reports that Meller had tied
himself to Gedney were incorrect. Meller had a telephone and had
been in constant contact with officials who could see him through
windows in the infirmary. He made no demands.
   Meller was serving a no-parole life term for killing a Nevada
Highway Patrol trooper at Lake Tahoe in 1975. He had no record of
previous trouble in the prison system.

<HEAD>Watkins Reconsidering Key Parts of Weapons Modernization Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is reconsidering key
parts of an $81 billion plan for revitalizing the nation's nuclear
weapons complex, including a proposal for building a new plutonium
refinery in Idaho, officials said.
   The plan, unveiled in the final days of the Reagan
administration, was billed as a 20-year blueprint for modernizing
the weapons plants, which are plagued by mechanical breakdowns,
safety flaws and widespread environmental problems.
   Since then, the breadth and depth of the problems have
increased, and Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has tried to
overhaul the weapons program to focus more on safety and
environmental issues.
   In a Sept. 29 internal memorandum made available to The
Associated Press on Friday, Watkins said he was creating a
committee of defense specialists to review the recommendations of
the December 1988 modernization plan prepared by his predecessor,
John Herrington, as well as its underlying assumptions.
   Watkins made clear he was unhappy with some elements of the
Herrington blueprint, although he did not say what changes he
wanted. He made no mention of costs.
   ``They did not adequately address some of the serious problems
that have since been identified particularly with respect to
environmental and waste management issues,'' Watkins wrote.
   ``Based on my review of these results, I am not satisfied that
the assumptions upon which the study was based are valid when
reviewed by today's standards,'' he said, adding he was ordering
``a hard relook at this whole issue.''
   Watkins did not spell out exactly what parts of the 2010 Report
he did not like. He said John Tuck, the No. 3 official in the
department, would head the review committee, which also includes
representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National
Security Council.
   One official involved in the review, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the group would present a report to Watkins' office
on Monday recommending a set of assumptions upon which to develop a
new modernization blueprint.
   A final report to Watkins on modernization recommendations is
due next April 2.
   The official said one assumption under review is the need for a
Special Isotope Separation plant, which would convert existing
supplies of fuel-grade plutonium to a grade suitable for
thermonuclear warheads. Critics have questioned the need for the
plant in light of adequate existing supplies of plutonium. It would
be built at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   Another proposal under review is a plan to build two new
tritium-producing reactors _ one at the Idaho laboratory and the
other at the Savannah River weapons plant, near Aiken, S.C., the
official said. They would replace three aging and currently
shut-down Savannah River reactors that make the tritium needed for
nuclear warheads.
   Many members of Congress have said budget constraints are likely
to kill at least one of the planned reactors.
   Among other elements of the 2010 Report now under review, the
official said, are:
   _Ending all operations at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver and
transferring its plutonium-processing activities to other
facilities. The main reason is its proximity to a major urban
center. The FBI currently is investigating alleged environmental
violations at the plant.
   _Phasing out the Fernald uranium-processing plant near
Cincinnati and transferring most of its operations to other sites.
The official said this could begin as early as next year. The plant
has been shut down since last summer because of environmental
problems, and no resumption date has been announced.

   The country's top business leaders are
trying to explain the deepest dive in the stock market since the
October crash of 1987 while they look with concern to the effect
the plunge will have on their companies.
   ``The thing you think about right away is what is going to
happen on Monday,'' said David T. Kearns, the head of Xerox.
   The nearly 191-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average
on Friday was an unwelcome and surprising intrusion into the fall
meetings of the Business Council at a posh resort in the Virginia
mountains.
   Many of the executives learned about the market's nose dive
while they were on the golf course or playing tennis.
   Many executives, who were wrapping up their sessions today,
suggested that the drop was the result of spreading problems in the
``junk bond'' market. Junk bonds, used to finance leveraged
buyouts, have been a driving force behind the market's rise this
year.
   Searching for a silver lining to the sell-off, some business
leaders said it could end up a positive development if it moderates
the frenzy of corporate takeovers which are leaving many U.S.
companies burdened with heavy debt loads.
   Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp., said the market plunge
could turn out to be a good thing if it ``leads to a flight to
quality'' stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeover
possibilities.
   John Akers, the head of IBM Corp., said he was concerned a
takeover epidemic had left many corporations so deeply in debt they
could be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase.
   After surveying the damage, the business leaders are wondering
whether the market will stabilize on Monday or continue falling.
   ``Anytime you have the market drop by (191) points, if you
aren't concerned, there's something wrong with you,'' said John
McGillicuddy, head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Still, many are sticking to the upbeat forecast of economic
prospects for next year that the business leaders had offered
before the stock market plunge.
   They had said economic growth would slow significantly next year
but that the country should be able to avoid a recession. They
forecast growth would rebound in 1991.
   Some, noting the sharp economic rebound following the 508-point
plunge of Oct. 19, 1987, dismissed the new dive as a one-day shock
which did nothing to shake their belief in continued prosperity.
   ``I don't think this says anything about the overall economy,''
said General Motors Chairman Roger B. Smith. ``This was a reaction
to leveraged buyouts.''
   Rand Araskog, the chairman of ITT, said he hoped the market's
plunge signaled politicians that more government regulation is
needed to curb the wave of corporate takeovers.
   ``The whole thing is a lot of nonsense and it should be
stopped,'' he said. ``We have a very nervous marketplace.''

   A young recruit who worked three years to
qualify for the police force shot himself to death at a firing
range after flunking his final chance at a marksmanship test.
   Daniel Morales, 21, was firing at the third and final target at
the Police Training Academy when he briefly pointed his .357
revolver at an examiner, then turned the gun to his head and shot
himself, Police Capt. George Hegerty said.
   Police said Morales' best score on the tests was 203. The
minimum required is 210 out of a possible 300.
   Morales was the only recruit at the firing range at the time,
police said. He died in a hospital almost seven hours later.
   Morales had attended Milwaukee Tech to help qualify for the
academy. He was promoted to officer recruit Aug. 20 and was
assigned to a class that graduates in January.
   He resigned Sept. 29 after failing a shooting test but appealed
for another chance after a vision examination indicated he needed
glasses, assistant city attorney Thomas C. Goeldner said.
   Acting chief Le Roy A. Jahnke had given Morales until Friday to
pass the marksmanship test. He had spent more than a week in
remedial firearms training, Goeldner said.
   After the shooting, the other 41 members of Morales' class met
to listen to counselors.
   ``We're as close as family here,'' police inspector Joseph A.
Kalivoda said. ``I've lost officers before and it never gets any
easier.''

<HEAD>Senate OKs $14 Billion Deficit-Cut Bill, Puts Off Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and President Bush are facing two
impending budget struggles following Senate passage of a $14
billion deficit-reduction bill that was stripped clean of billions
of dollars of spending items and tax breaks.
   The chamber's 87-7 passage of the fiscal 1990 deficit-cutting
legislation late Friday set the stage for what could be difficult
negotiations between the Senate and House on a compromise version
of the bill.
   Unless Bush signs the compromise into law by Monday _ impossible
because House members are away for the weekend _ $16 billion in
defense and domestic spending cuts will take effect that day. The
fiscal year began Oct. 1.
   The deal worked out between Democratic and Republican leaders
also left the bill minus a capital gains tax cut that has been a
priority for Bush, putting off that partisan showdown.
   Most members of the Senate _ which the Democrats dominate 55-45
_ favor a capital gains reduction, but Republicans were unable to
gather the 60 votes they needed to get that measure attached to the
deficit bill.
   ``We're putting aside capital gains today, but I can promise ...
we'll be back, ready to win, ready to prevail at the earliest
opportunity,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``This was a major defeat for the president,'' Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine told reporters later. He said the
administration ``expended more energy and effort'' on the capital
gains fight than it had on any issue this year.
   After a week of contentious debate, senators agreed to pare the
legislation to items that raise $5.3 billion in taxes and cut about
$8.7 billion in spending. Gone were expanded child care efforts, an
extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone calls, new programs to
promote sales of crops ranging from soybeans to kiwi fruit and
other provisions.
   The deal was cemented shortly before final passage when senators
voted by voice to strip the so-called extraneous items from the
bill, slicing the legislation from 1,376 pages to about 200.
   ``We're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of
being a deficit-reduction bill,'' said Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Lawmakers are likely to renew their fight over items that don't
make the final House-Senate compromise bill in new tax legislation
Congress will consider, probably in two or three weeks, senators
said.
   The bill contains about two dozen new or increased taxes, mostly
on corporations.
   Departing international air travelers would face a doubling of
the current $3 tax, some farm workers would have income taxes
withheld for the first time, and a new tax would be imposed on
producers of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer of the
atmosphere.
   The measure also would cut Medicare spending by more than $2
billion, mainly by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals.
   It also is rife with gimmicky provisions Congress and Bush
agreed to months ago. Nearly $1.8 billion in claimed savings come
from no longer counting the Postal Service's operating losses in
budget calculations. Hundreds of millions of more in ``savings''
arise from shifting payments planned for this year into future
years.
   The House passed its own $11 billion version of the measure _
containing dozens of special-interest provisions of its own _ on
Oct. 5.
   That measure contained a two-year capital gains tax cut, a child
care expansion, a rollback of year-old Medicare benefits for
elderly patients who need lengthy hospital stays, and new Medicaid
initiatives.
   Congressional leaders have said they expect the automatic cuts
under Gramm-Rudman to be rolled back when the deficit-reduction
bill is signed into law.

   Federal regulators are advancing $7.1 billion
to help the buyers of four large insolvent savings institutions in
the first major deals struck since Congress enacted a $50 billion
bailout plan.
   The sales of thrifts in Houston, Pennsylvania, Florida and
California were announced late Friday by the Resolution Trust
Corp., created Aug. 9 when President Bush signed the bailout bill.
   NCNB, an aggressive regional bank holding company headquartered
in Charlotte, N.C., purchased two of the thrifts offered by the RTC.
   A third thrift was sold to a Canadian savings institution and
the fourth was sold another to Meridian Bancorp. of Reading, Pa.
   RTC executive director David C. Cook said a fifth large thrift,
Peoples Heritage Savings of Salina, Kan., had been scheduled for
sale but was not sold because the bids submitted were unacceptable.
   The four institutions sold, the new owner, and the amount of
government cash advanced are:
   _University Federal Savings Association, Houston, acquired by
NCNB Texas National Bank, $3.8 billion.
   _Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa., purchased by
Meridian, $1.9 billion.
   _Freedom Savings and Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., acquired by
NCNB National Bank of Florida, $875 million.
   _Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif., taken over by Royal
Trustco Limited of Toronto, $550 million.
   The buyers are putting up a total of $2.33 billion to purchase
some of the sound loans and other assets of the institutions, and
they are paying the government a combined $224.9 million to take
over deposits of the failed thrifts.
   They have also agreed to put up enough additional money to bring
the S&amp;Ls into compliance with capital standards, RTC spokesman
Steven Katsanos said.
   The government is retaining ``bad'' assets _ repossessed real
estate and sour loans _ with a book value of $2.33 billion. It
hopes to recover some of its $7.1 billion outlay by selling those
assets.
   Normal operating hours are continuing at Peoples Heritage and
the four institutions sold.
   The five institutions, particularly Peoples Heritage, University
Federal and Hill Financial, strayed from traditional S&amp;L lending
for single-family mortgages, concentrating instead on speculative
construction and development lending for large commercial and
residential projects, Ely said.
   Prior to Friday's sales, the RTC had closed 27 small S&amp;Ls. The
RTC has more than 250 S&amp;Ls in its control and expects as many as
300 others will fail in the next three years.

<HEAD>Former Rebel Leader Returns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, a
former leader of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, returned to
Nicaragua to help his mother's opposition presidential campaign.
   Chamorro Barrios arrived in Managua Friday night from Costa Rica
and, like all returning rebels, signed a document when he
re-entered Nicaragua that says he accepts a government amnesty and
belongs to no armed group.
   ``I'm coming to help my mother as much as I can,'' Chamorro, 38,
told reporters at the airport.
   Violeta Chamorro, publisher of the newspaper La Prensa, is the
candidate of the United National Opposition coalition, and
President Daniel Ortega's main challenger in Feb. 25, 1990,
elections. Ortega, of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, is
running for another five-year term.
   Chamorro Barrios was the fifth former Nicaraguan Resistance
leader to return to Nicaragua under a repatriation program called
for in a regional peace accord signed by five Central American
presidents. The others were Alfredo Cesar, Azucena Ferrey, Roberto
Ferrey and Alfonso Robelo.
   More than 500 rebels also have returned.
   Chamorro Barrios resigned as a director of the resistance in
1988 after the U.S. government stopped weapons shipments to the
Contras. The United States continues to supply the rebels with
humanitarian aid.
   Under the Aug. 7 regional agreement, the estimated 12,000 rebels
are to be disbanded from camps along Honduras' border with
Nicaragua by mid-December. In exchange, President Daniel Ortega
moved national elections up to Feb. 25 and promised that
campaigning and voting will be free and fair, with no restrictions
on the press.
   Chamorro Barrios is a founder of the Social Democratic Party,
one of the 13 parties in the opposition coalition.
   He said he would not rejoin La Prensa, which he ran before going
into exile in Costa Rica in March 1985, but would work as an
independent journalist. Chamorro Barrios said he planned to write
articles for the U.S. newspaper Diario de Las Americas and will
continue his commentaries for Channel 23 television in Miami.
   His father, newspaper editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal,
was a strong critic of former President Anastasio Somoza. Chamorro
Cardenal's January 1978 assassination broadened support for the
Sandinista revolution that overthrew Somoza in July 1979, ending
the Somoza family's 42-year rule.
   La Prensa now is the only daily in Nicaragua that opposes the
Sandinistas. Mrs. Chamorro served on the first post-revolutionary
junta but resigned after a year and joined the opposition, citing
the Sandinistas move to the left and its links with Cuba and the
Soviet Union.

Colombians.
   The Coast Guard said in a release that it seized the 40-foot

Friday, after a Coast Guard boarding party discovered 40 to 50
bales of marijuana.
   The Coast Guard did not estimate the value of the drugs.
   It said the Sony was taken to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on
Puerto Rico's eastern tip, where the drugs and four unidentified
Colombians were turned over to federal agents.

   Drug Enforcement Administration undercover
agents have arrested two District of Columbia men after the pair
attempted to buy cocaine with an estimated street value of $1.5
million, an official says.
   Ricardo Bernard Smith, 22, and Michael F. Johnson, 20, were
charged at 11:30 p.m. Friday with possession, distribution and
conspiracy to distribute cocaine, Mario Perez, a spokesman for the
DEA's Washington Field Division, said early today.
   The two were finalizing a transaction with the undercover agents
to buy 33 pounds, or 15 kilos, of cocaine, when they were arrested
at the Radisson Hotel in Alexandria, Va., across the Potomac River
from the nation's capital, said Perez.
   The pair had agreed during earlier negotiations to pay $231,000
for the cocaine from an unidentified agent who was posing as a
cocaine supply source, the spokesman said. Smith told the agent
Friday that he had $160,000 cash and offered his 1989 Porsche and a
Rolex watch to make up the difference, Perez said.
   Johnson and Smith were being held without bond in the Alexandria
jail and were scheduled to appear before a U.S. Magistrate on
Monday, said Perez.

   Ferdinand Marcos was eulogized by a long-time
supporter Friday as a person much like Jesus Christ _ betrayed by
the misguided will of the people but forgiving to those who had
wronged him.
   ``Christ was a victim of the people's power, so Marcos was a
victim of the people's power,'' said Roman Catholic Monsignor
Domingo Nebres of the Philippines, referring to the 1986 ``people
power'' revolt that ended Marcos' dictatorial rule and forced him
into exile in Hawaii.
   ``My dear beloved president would say, `Do not cry for me ...
cry for your country,'' Nebres told the 1,500 family members,
dignitaries and supporters who packed the Co-Cathedral of St.
Theresa, the largest Roman Catholic church in Honolulu.
   The funeral Mass took place even as it remained uncertain where
the former Philippine president will be buried.
   Marcos' coffin, draped with a Philippine flag, arrived at about
6:30 p.m. borne by 10 pallbearers wearing white Philippine military
uniforms and black armbands. All were former Philippine military
officials, including Col. Arturo Aruiza, Marcos' closest adviser
during his three-year exile in Hawaii.
   Marcos' widow, Imelda, was accompanied by two of her children,
Ferdinand ``Bong Bong'' Marcos Jr. and daughter Irene Araneta, as
well as other relatives.
   Mrs. Marcos was clad entirely in black, including a black veil
covering her face, and clutched a silver rosary. She did not answer
reporters' questions.
   A standing-room only crowd filled the Co-Cathedral of St.
Theresa. Dozens of people waited outside the church, trying to peer
inside.
   Mrs. Marcos sat in the front row as Marcos' coffin was brought
to the front of the church. Aruiza stood at full military rest near
Marcos, whose casket was surrounded by white flowers.
   The body was to be returned to Nuuanu Mortuary for entombment
Sunday at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park.
   At least eight Marcos security guards, as well as two Honolulu
police officers on special duty and an unknown number of FBI agents
attended the service.
   ``We are most concerned about making sure the service is
dignified and to protect the people inside,'' said Rev. Daniel
McNichol, the church's rector.
   Philippine Consul General to Hawaii Tomas Gomez said there were
no official representatives of his government at the funeral.
However, several Philippine congressmen attended, including former
Labor Minister Blas Ople and Congressman Roquito Ablan Jr., said
Marcos supporter Joe Lazo.
   Lazo also said Christina Ponce Enrile, wife of Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile, the former defense minister, would attend, as well as the
wife of Philippine Gen. Fabian Ver, Marcos' right-hand man during
his rule. Fabian Ver's whereabouts are unknown and he is a fugitive
from justice.
   Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, died here Sept.
28 following a long illness.
   Supporters are constructing what they call a temporary resting
place for Marcos' body, which has been at his hillside
home-in-exile since the day of his death.
   Work continued Friday on the air-conditioned shed at Valley of
the Temples Memorial Park. Marcos family spokesman Arturo Aruiza
said he expects the wood and corrugated metal structure to be
completed by Sunday, when Marcos' remains are to be moved to the
cemetery.
   Mrs. Marcos has vowed to bury him in the Philippines but
Philippine President Corazon Aquino has banned his return, even in
death.
   The Philippine government Friday claimed Marcos' family has
plotted to kill Mrs. Aquino and asked the Supreme Court to uphold
her ban on returning his body to the Philippines for burial.
   The claim was made in a brief filed with the court asking it to
reject a petition by Marcos supporters to allow members of Marcos'
family to return his remains from Hawaii.
   Marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt that catapulted Mrs.
Aquino to power. He was exiled to Hawaii, where he was subsequently
indicted by the U.S. government for allegedly looting his nation's
treasury.
   Mrs. Marcos has said having her husband's body entombed above
ground in the guarded shed would make it easier to return his
remains to the Philippines if Mrs. Aquino changes her mind, or if
the Philippine Supreme Court overturns the ban.

<HEAD>Alleged IRA Member Says Extradition Denial Proves His Innocence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Roman Catholic priest sought by
Britain for his alleged links with the IRA said Ireland's refusal
to extradite him was a de facto acquittal.
   Patrick Ryan said Friday that he is now ``innocent in the eyes
of the law.''
   The government said Thursday that Ryan, 59, will not be
prosecuted because material submitted by Britain to bring him to
trial was insufficient.
   Britain tried to secure Ryan's extradition on charges of murder
and bombing conspiracy and explosives possession on the British
mainland from 1975 to 1988. The Irish Republican Army, outlawed in
Britain and Ireland, is fighting a guerrilla campaign to drive the
British out of Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated
province with Ireland, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

<HEAD>Robot That Spots Corrosion on Fighter Jets Safer Might Do Same For
Airliners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A robot with a neutron
ray gun that spots deadly corrosion in Air Force jets could become
an important weapon in ensuring the safety of the nation's aging
commercial airliners.
   The new, computer-controlled machine is being programmed to test
F-111 fighter-bombers and other planes inside a specially built
hangar at this Sacramento-area base.
   Even before it goes into day-to-day use in mid-1990, the Federal
Aviation Administration has commissioned a study to see if versions
of the $7.3 million hangar would be practical for use on civilian
airliners.
   The new machine can scan an entire airliner in a period of
hours, zeroing in on problem spots, say the private engineers who
designed it.
   ``You've got to find that Achilles' heel,'' said Doug Froom, the
civilian Air Force employee who designed the device. ``That's what
this system is good at.''
   The safety of the nation's passenger jets has taken on new
significance since a section of fuselage peeled off the top of an
Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 over Hawaii in April 1988. That accident,
which killed a flight attendant, was blamed on metal fatigue in the
airliner's skin.
   The FAA responded by ordering airlines to inspect the outside of
their planes more thoroughly for cracks that could indicate metal
fatigue. And earlier this month, the agency revealed it was
preparing a series of orders requiring airlines to regularly strip
the insides of airliners to check for corrosion, a problem similar
to metal fatigue.
   The N-ray, say its designers, could take the place of the
time-consuming searches the FAA will order.
   The corrosion-detector at McClellan shoots neutrons _ one of the
particles that makes up the atom _ through a plane to a receiver on
the other side.
   Neutrons penetrate metal but are absorbed by the hydrogen in the
dust produced by corrosion. The neutron flow is translated into a
television image that inspectors can watch and record.
   The scanner is held by a flexible arm, operated by remote
control inside a hangar with concrete walls thick enough to contain
errant low-level radiation. The designers say the radiation isn't a
health threat to workers who follow safety precautions.
   But airline industry representatives said the machine has major
drawbacks, not the least of which is its high cost. They also cited
radiation fears, though those aren't considered a problem at the
Air Force installation, and the potential difficulty of adjusting
the machine to scan airliners.
   Boeing Co. spokesman Jack Gamble, asked to list objections other
than cost, said, ``I'm not going to give 10 reasons why we don't
want to use it. It's a technical question.''
   Consumer groups, which have criticized existing inspection
efforts as outdated and inadequate, said they want to make sure the
controversy over the N-ray centers on the device's effectiveness
rather than its cost.
   ``If it reveals corrosion in the places in which traditionally
it's been hard to find, then what price safety?'' said Richard
Livingston of the International Airline Passengers Association.
``It's hard to imagine anything costing too much to safeguard human
life.''
   The firm that built the robot, Cimcorp Robotic Systems of St.
Paul, Minn., said it could make a machine big enough to scan the
largest commercial airliner for about $30 million, without counting
the cost of a radiation-shielded building to house it.
   Cimcorp's Ken Bucher contrasted that to the cost of a commercial
jetliner, which runs up to about $125 million for a Boeing 747.
``You look at that cost against the cost of one airliner and that
number becomes small again,'' he said.
   The Air Force says the N-ray device _ and an adjoining X-ray
inspection station similar to those already in use in the industry
_ should make back their $28.7 million cost in two years by saving
on maintenance spending. The N-ray, for example, can do in 16 hours
what human inspectors would need several months to do if they had
to dismantle the plane.
   Earlier this year, the FAA, which oversees commercial air
transportation, awarded a New Jersey-based research firm, Galaxy
Scientific Corp., a $47 million contract to study the N-ray and
other inspection techniques.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
proposed a two-year budget of $1.98 billion and scolded nations
that don't pay their dues.
   He did not single out any countries, but the United States tops
the list of 66 deadbeats with a debt of more than $495 million as
of Sept. 30.
   As it is, the world body has barely enough money to meet
expenses through the end of the month, the U.N. chief said Friday.
   Perez de Cuellar said his 1990-91 budget projection, given to
the General Assembly committee that handles budgetary affairs,
``represents a negative rate of real growth of 0.4 percent.''
   Under the plan, personnel would be reduced by 12 percent and
their would be either no change or a reduction in most expenses,
including travel for staff and consultants.
   ``The only increases in expenditures relate to strictly mandated
activities, notably construction of new premises and technological
innovations,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   But the United will face insolvency if not all of the 159 member
nations pay their dues, he said.
   ``The situation is ominous. As of yesterday, only 66 member
states had paid their assessments for 1989 in full and had no
contributions outstanding for prior years,'' he said. ``Outstanding
contributions to the regular budget _ including arrears _ amounted
to $603.8 million.''
   Perez de Cuellar said the United Nations has $68 million left in
its General Fund, an amount barely sufficient to cover expenditures
through October.
   U.S. congressional subcommittees have given preliminary approval
for payment of $205.5 million toward the full 1990 fiscal year
assessment of $216 million. They rejected State Department requests
for $46 million more to pay about 10 percent of the arrears, citing
U.S. budgetary constraints.
   Beginning in 1985, the Reagan administration began withholding
U.S. dues to protest what it said was anti-Western bias,
inefficiency and budget overruns.
   In September 1988, Reagan said U.N. austerity measures warranted
payment of back dues, a job passed to the Bush administration.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is
reassuring the nation the largest decline in the stock market since
the 1987 crash will not hurt the real economy that provides
Americans with jobs and stable prices.
   ``The outlook is good for continued moderate growth,'' said
Brady, who issued a statement two hours after the market closed
Friday.
   He was the only senior government official to comment on the
stunning almost 191-point drop of the Dow Jones industrial average.
   President Bush refused to answer reporters' shouted questions
while boarding a helicopter at the White House on his way to his
Camp David retreat in Maryland.
   A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board said the central bank
would have no comment. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden, in his second full day on the job, was equally
tight-lipped.
   ``Today's decline ... should be viewed in the context of a
591-point rise since Jan. 1, 1989,'' Brady said.
   ``It's important to recognize that today's stock market decline
doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the
economy,'' he said. ``The economy remains well balanced and the
outlook is for continued moderate growth.''
   Private economists generally agreed, even though the Labor
Department said Friday that wholesale inflation shot up a worrisome
0.9 percent in September. Analysts said the increase was due
largely to a one-time climb in energy prices and a statistical
fluke in the measurement of auto prices.
   Also, economists pointed to an unexpected 0.5 percent rise in
retail sales last month as evidence the economy, although growing
more slowly than last year, retained some strength.
   Traders said the stock plummet was triggered by the failure of a
management-labor group to arrange financing for a takeover of
United Airlines' parent company. That hurt takeover-related stocks,
which in turn dragged down the market generally.
   ``I think it's a one-day panic,'' said economist David Wyss of
DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. ``I think
it's fairly clear the drop was caused by the (United Airlines)
deal.''
   Nevertheless, analysts said the market turmoil will further
pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The central
bank has preferred to focus on containing inflation with high
interest rates, but that may soon change, according to analysts.
   ``The Federal Reserve, just as it did in 1987, will move to pump
liquidity into the system and push interest rates significantly
lower,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer in New York.
   ``I'm expecting the Fed will ease perhaps a full percentage
point within the next few weeks,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, said he was concerned that market trading
systems be ready to handle heavy volume on Monday. He said he
received one report of market makers in the over-the-counter market
_ brokers who normally stand ready to buy or sell specific stocks
not listed on an exchange _ refusing to answer their telephones
late Friday.
   ``That's disturbing,'' Riegle said. ``I think one of the lessons
of two years ago is that it's very important that market makers be
in place and that there be sufficient liquidity to handle whatever
the volume is.''
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee
overseeing market regulation, used the crash to renew his campaign
for restructuring market regulation.
   ``This is the second heart attack, two years after the first.
It's about time we made the changes necessary to avoid a third,''
he said.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole steered the
heads of Pittston Co. and the United Mine Workers to their first
meeting since a bitter strike began six months ago, saying ``it's
time to start the healing.''
   Mrs. Dole said Friday she believed face-to-face talks between
Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas and UMW President Richard Trumka
were the only way to break the long stalemate.
   ``I'm not a mediator. I'm not here to say I have the answer to
this complex problem, but I do feel now it is time to see if we can
facilitate the bargaining process,'' she said. ``Ultimately, it has
to be resolved between the private parties.''
   The labor secretary announced she had arranged the meeting for
this afternoon in her Washington office after a fact-finding trip
to the coal fields.
   Douglas and Trumka haven't met since 1,695 miners in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky went on strike April 5 against Pittston
Coal Group Inc.
   Face-to-face talks between lower-level negotiators broke off
June 7. They resumed in July, but have regressed to the point where
negotiators for the company and union are meeting a few days a
month in separate rooms with a federal mediator shuttling messages
back and forth.
   The strike has crippled production at Pittston, and sympathy
walkouts by tens of thousands of miners at other companies idled
much of the nation's coal production in June and July.
   ``We're talking about communities being torn apart and in some
cases families torn apart,'' Mrs. Dole said after meeting with
company officials, strikers and workers hired to take their place
in the mines. ``It's time to start the healing process.''
   Union leader Trumka has asked repeatedly to meet with Douglas,
but Douglas has declined, saying local managers understood
conditions better than he.
   ``We have our best team at the bargaining table,'' said Michael
Odom, president of Pittston's Lebanon-based mining subsidiary. Odom
declined to comment on the meeting between Trumka and Douglas.
   Wages aren't an issue in the strike. The union wants a benefits
and job security package equal to the rest of the coal industry.
The company has declined, saying it needs more flexibility in its
work schedules and costs in order to compete with foreign mines.
   The strike has become a rallying point for organized labor
across the country. Union leaders contend the company is attempting
to break the UMW with the help of one-sided labor laws. Pittston
denies it is trying to rid itself of union employees.
   Mrs. Dole spoke to many of the 280 pickets at the entrance to a
mammoth coal preparation plant that 98 striking miners invaded and
occupied for four days in September.
   ``They're trying to destroy our union,'' Joel Phillips, a picket
captain from Castlewood, told her.
   Twelve miles away in Lebanon, one of seven Pittston Coal Group
employees Mrs. Dole talked to said he was attacked three times on
his way home from work in August after his truck tires were
flattened by twisted nails called jackrocks.
   With tears in his eyes and his hand in a cast, Roger Helbert of
Russell County said his nose was broken and his fingers crushed by
large rocks hurled through his car window and windshield.
   ``It was terrible,'' he said.
   An official of Poland's Solidarity union visited the coal fields
Wednesday and Thursday, met with Mrs. Dole Thursday and criticized
the treatment of striking miners.
   UMW spokesman Gene Carroll said he believed the labor
secretary's trip was made in part because the the Bush
administration was embarrassed that the Polish labor leader
complained about this country's treatment of workers.
   Mrs. Dole denied that, saying she came to Virginia because she
was frustrated at the long impasse and concerned about the
suffering of strikers.

<HEAD>Report: Bloch Paid Vienna Prostitute Up to $10,000 a Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix Bloch, the former U.S. diplomat suspected
of spying, maintained a seven-year relationship with an Austrian
prostitute who said he asked to be humiliated and beaten, ABC News
reported.
   Bloch spent up to $10,000 a year on the prostitute, identified
only as ``Tina,'' and was her only customer for a year or two, ABC
News reported Friday.
   With the assistance of the Austrian government, the FBI brought
Tina to the United States in early August to be interrogated and to
testify before a secret grand jury, ABC reported, without saying
where the interview took place.
   Tina told ABC the grand jury wanted to know about Bloch's sexual
habits.
   ``I told them that he came to me once a week to be humiliated
and be beaten,'' she said, adding that Bloch never revealed any
secrets to her.
   Bloch, the former No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
and a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, has been under
surveillance by FBI agents since June. He has not been charged with
any crime but was put on paid leave at the State Department in June.
   The Justice Department launched its probe after Bloch, 54, was
photographed handing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in a
restaurant in Paris in May.
   The relationship between Bloch and Tina has increased concern
among U.S. officials that Bloch might have had fallen into a Soviet
sex trap, ABC said.
   Tina told ABC that Bloch would visit her once or twice a week
and pay $200 each time. Bloch was earning $60,000-$80,000 a year
during that period, ABC reported.
   She said she did not know at first that Bloch was a U.S.
diplomat but said he later complained about his job at the U.S.
mission in Vienna.
   ``You couldn't have a real conversation with him and you always
had the idea that he was depressed or down. You had the idea he was
very discontent with everything,'' Tina told ABC.
   Bloch, who was in West Virginia Friday, declined to comment to
ABC about the report.
   He did not return a message left by The Associated Press on his
home telephone answering machine, and his lawyer was not at home.

   South Korea's main dissident alliance
today demanded the recall of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg and said
an attack on his residence by radical students was ``the will of
the people.''
   About 400 radical students armed with firebombs and rocks
battled riot police today at Seoul's Sogang University in the
second straight day of anti-American campus protests. ``Yankee go
home!'' protesters shouted.
   Security was bolstered at all U.S. government facilities
following the attack Friday on Gregg's official residence, National
Police Headquarters said today. Riot police were assigned to the
U.S. Embassy, but officials declined to give any details.
   Chonminyon, an alliance of dissident groups, defended the
storming of Gregg's home by six radical students, who hurled
homemade bombs to distract the Korean guards and rampaged through
the home, smashing artwork with iron bars.
   Gregg and his wife Meg, who were awakened at dawn by the blast
of bombs hurled by the attacking radicals, escaped unharmed through
a side entrance. The six students were overpowered and arrested by
riot police.
   Embassy officials said they would review the security system of
the residence. Unlike the U.S. Embassy, it is not guarded by U.S.
Marines but by Korean police.
   After the attack, about 6,000 radical students took part in
anti-U.S. protests on 26 campuses in seven cities Friday, police
said.
   The attack ``reflected the will of the people,'' Chonminyon
leaders claimed at a news conference, where they issued a statement
calling for an end to close U.S. ties. The alliance has dwindled in
recent months as its policies have alienated public opinion and its
senior leaders have been jailed.
   Chonminyon demanded the United States recall Gregg, saying he
had helped to support military rule when he was CIA station chief
in Seoul in the 1970s. ``We ask you to immediately recall Gregg to
return South Korean-U.S. relations to normal,'' the group said in
its statement.
   The radical alliance, represented at the news conference by
several top leaders, also called for withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea and an end to U.S. demands for greater
access to South Korean markets.
   ``The presence of U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula serves as
an obstacle to peace in the region,'' the group said.
   The students who attacked Gregg's residence shouted slogans
calling for the ambassador's recall and an end to U.S. trade
pressure. The United States wants Seoul to end import barriers to
correct a huge trade surplus with Washington.
   President Roh Tae-woo is to leave Sunday for Washington for
talks with President Bush and other officials. Radical groups
demanded Roh abandon the trip, charging he was seeking to improve
U.S. ties to bolster his conservative government.
   The government and the main opposition parties condemned the
attack as the work of a tiny violent minority. South Korean leaders
stressed the need to preserve the traditionally close alliance with
Washington.
   South Korea's radical students claim Washington has supported
authoritarian governments that have ruled South Korea for much of
its history. Radicals have staged a series of attacks on U.S.
facilities in recent years.
   The radicals have very little support because of their violent
tactics and extremist views. Radical protests have declined in
recent months because of the lack of support.

<HEAD>Airline Buyout Is Not Doomed, Say Pilots and Analyst</HEAD>

   The pilot-management group seeking to buy the
parent of United Airlines said the $6.75 billion deal isn't dead
despite a failure to obtain financing, which sent the stock market
into a free fall.
   ``It has been a 3{-year struggle to get where we were this
morning, anyway, and this is just another obstacle _ one of many we
hope to overcome _ as we have all along,'' Hank Krakowski, a
spokesman for the pilots' union, said Friday.
   His spoke after the group representing United pilots and
management announced it had failed to get adequate financing for
its bid to buy UAL Corp., parent of the nation's second-largest
airline.
   The announcement helped trigger a drop of almost 191 points in
the Dow Jones industrial average, the biggest point drop since the
crash of 1987, and cast doubt on the prospect for other
debt-financed takeovers.
   ``I think the deal has hit a stumbling block. I don't think it's
dead by any means,'' said analyst Louis A. Marckesano, who follows
airlines for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``I
think the market overreacted.''
   The pilot-management group said banks arranging financing for
the proposed $300-a-share acquisition of UAL indicated they had not
received sufficient commitments to complete the buyout at that
price.
   But the group _ which also includes British Airways PLC _ said
it expected to revise the proposal and continue its attempts to buy
the company.
   In London, British Airways said it was confident the group still
would be able to raise the necessary financing.
   Marckesano predicted it would be Wednesday before the group
would be able to say whether it could pull commitments together for
the deal.
   One unanswered question, he said, is the status of the recently
rejected bid for UAL by California billionaire Marvin Davis, whose
quest for the company prompted the pilot-management group to make
its offer in August.
   Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman for Davis, said in New York that
Davis had no statement after Friday's events. Davis had bid $6.19
billion, or $275 a share.
   But Davis said last month he would be willing to match the $6.75
billion buyout offer of the pilot-management group if that deal
collapsed. He also said he would demand no labor concessions _ a
key point for unions.
   Nevertheless, Krakowski said the pilot-management bid was
attractive in large part because it included an employee stock
ownership plan.
   ``And under current ESOP tax laws, the tax savings available
allow us to service the debt, even in a recession, to a much
greater degree than, say, a Marvin Davis, or an outside raider
could,'' he said in an interview on WBBM-AM radio late Friday.
   Under the proposed offer, UAL workers would own 75 percent of
the company, management would hold 10 percent and British Airways
would own 15 percent.
   UAL issued a statement that its board would review any revised
proposal it received from the pilot-management group and would
review all other financial or strategic alternatives available to
it.
   In September, Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank committed $3
billion to finance the buyout and were to obtain commitments for an
additional $4.2 billion.
   Spokespersons from the two banks did not return telephone calls
seeking comment Friday. However, a spokesman for British Airways
said he understood the financing collapsed because Japanese banks
dropped out of the deal.
   The 7,000 union pilots at United had tried to enlist the support
of the Machinists' and flight attendants' unions. But the
Machinists, representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 workers,
vehemently opposed the buyout, saying it was overpriced and would
cripple the airline with too much debt.
   Trading in UAL stock was halted because of the group's
announcement, but the airline's shares still fell $5.50 to close at
$279.75.
   Friday's developments also cast a pall over shares of other
companies involved in or planning debt-financed deals. They include
American Airlinles' parent AMR Corp., subject of a $7 billion
buyout offer from Donald Trump.

   Financial analysts predicted global selling
following the New York stock market plunge but most said it would
not equal the 1987 crash. A Hong Kong securities director dismissed
the dip as a U.S. problem.
   The second-largest dive in U.S. history occurred mostly in the
final hour of trading in New York, after markets in Tokyo, London
and elsewhere had closed. But the fallout was expected to continue
Monday with the reopening of financial markets elsewhere.
   U.S. analysts blamed the 190.58 decline on collapse of the
``junk bond'' market _ which has been used to finance takeovers and
leveraged buyouts _ and an increase in the producer price index,
indicating higher inflation.
   The Times of London said today, ``World stock markets are
bracing themselves for a rerun of the 1987 crash. Fund managers
were forecasting that the fall would lead to a global wave of
selling, although many doubted that it would be at the panic levels
of 1987.''
   But in Hong Kong, Larry Tam, director of Sun Hung Kai
Securities, said the crash was a U.S. problem. He said it probably
would not greatly affect the Hong Kong stock market when it
reopened Monday, although the index might drop 50 to 60 points.
   He said the Hong Kong market had risen in past days because the
British colony was planning significant projects such as a new
airport. Hong Kong traders, therefore, were confident and probably
would not be affected, he said.
   In trading today, gold rose $3.71 an ounce on the Hong Kong
market, to close at $367.40, compared to Friday's close of $363.69.
   In Tokyo, Kazuhiro Nomura of New Japan Securities Co. said,
``The Nikkei index might plunge when the Tokyo market opens Monday,
because Japanese investors will be inclined to sell.''
   He said the Tokyo exchange might drop temporarily but in the
long run the fall in New York would not have a major impact on the
Tokyo market.
   ``Since there is no change in Japanese economic fundamentals,
the Tokyo market will not fall as sharply as in New York just
because of the plunge on Wall Street,'' Nomura said.
   In London, Alex Hammond-Chambers of the British fund management
company Ivory and Sime said: ``I imagine London will follow suit on
Monday ... We survived that one (the 1987 crash) and the markets
have since recovered.''
   Richard Jeffrey, director of economics at the London securities
company Hoare Govett, said comparisons with 1987 were unfair
because many companies were now valued at lower levels.
   But he said prices on the London stock market could fall heavily
when it reopens Monday. He predicted the Financial Times share
price index of 30 leading British companies, a major market
indicator, could fall to 1,718 Monday against 1,818 at close Friday.
   His predicted 100-point fall compares with a drop of 183.7
points on Oct. 19, 1987 _ the first day of the crash two years ago.
   Jeffrey said the London market had escaped the vogue for junk
bonds and would be cushioned from a dramatic collapse.
   The Bank of England in a statement late Friday also said the
U.S. market had been underpinned by leveraged transactions.
   But John Chiene, chairman of the British investment bank County
NatWest Wood Mackenzie, said, ``Our (London) stock market has been
in a delicate condition for some time. Given the extent to which we
have been tracking Wall Street, this news is likely to have a
significant adverse impact on Monday.''
   London stock market prices have been weak as the value of the
British pound continued to slip despite high interest rates.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government on
Oct. 5 increased British interest rates by one percentage point to
15 percent following rate increases by West Germany and five other
European countries.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed late Friday 39.8
points lower over the week.
   Terry Connor, from the London finance house Robert Fleming,
said, ``Sentiment in London was already nervous. It's reminiscent
of 1987 and almost anything can happen...
   ``Given the fear element and the closeness of the anniversary of
the 1987 crash, we are in for a very nervous Monday.''

   President Bush says he still wants Panamanian
ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power but that doesn't mean
he's giving a ``carte blanche'' for use of U.S. military troops to
help remove him.
   Bush, continuing to defend his decision not to intervene in the
failed coup attempt by Panamanian military officers last week,
said, ``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a
prudent manner.''
   But, he said, ``I hope I would never be reckless enough as a
commander in chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force
without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt.''
   He called complaints that he should have used military power to
back up his repeated calls for Panamanians to oust Noriega ``a
stupid argument that some very erudite people make.''
   In a brief news conference at the White House, Bush also avoided
saying whether he would veto newly passed legislation to loosen
restrictions on federal funding for abortions. He said he still
opposes giving federal money for abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape and incest.
   But he said he wants to ``see if there is room for flexibility''
to ``avoid a veto on my part'' after Senate and House negotiators
work out a compromise version of a bill on abortion funding.
   As to the lack of U.S. military backing for the Panamanian
insurgents who tried to overthrow Noriega on Oct. 3, Bush said he
is not ``ruling out the use of force for all time.''
   However, he said, ``I am not going to give carte blanche support
to an operation, particularly when they don't ask for this support
... I have at stake the lives of American kids and I am not going
to easily thrust them into a battle unless I feel comfortable with
it and unless those general officers in whom I have total
confidence feel comfortable.''
   He reiterated that he believes he made the right decisions, but
said his administration was reviewing procedures to see ``if we
can't do it better.''
   He also said it is ``well worth looking into'' the complaint by
the widow of the coup leader, Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, about poor
telephone communications during the insurgency.
   Mrs. Giroldi said coup leaders were rebuffed when they used a
telephone number that U.S. authorities had provided for
emergencies, and Americans who answered demanded to know why they
were using the line.
   ``To the degree we can improve our communications, fine,'' Bush
said.
   As a result of an internal review, the administration has
decided a crisis-management team will be automatically convened in
the White House situation room in future emergencies, a senior
official said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that the Bush
administration, without changing an executive order banning
assassinations of foreign leaders, has chosen to legally interpret
``assassination'' as referring only to premeditated political
murder.
   A new legal ruling, drafted by the Office of the Army Judge
Advocate General, would permit clandestine operations even if they
threaten the lives of foreign figures.
   Unidentified administration officials quoted by the Times said
the ruling would significantly expand the scope of military
operations the United States could legally launch against
terrorists, drug lords or fugitives abroad, the newspaper reported.
   At the news conference, Bush also said:
   _He will not veto a bill outlawing flag burning, but will let it
become law without his signature. He said he doesn't think the law
will withstand court challenges and he will push for his preferred
alternative _ a constitutional amendment that would accomplish the
same thing.
   _He still wants Congress to approve his capital gains tax cut
proposal. He did not say he would veto legislation that combined
his proposal with a Democratic version liberalizing Individual
Retirement Accounts. A few hours later, Senate leaders agreed on a
plan to strip hundreds of special-interest provisions from a $14.1
billion deficit-reduction bill, leaving the capital gains fight for
the future.

   East Germany says the refugee
exodus has cut significantly into its labor force, and its
Communist government is calling on those left behind to help close
the gap.
   ``We certainly can do more, indeed a lot more,'' the state
newspaper Berliner Zeitung urged the country's workers Friday.
   Even before tens of thousands of people, many of them skilled
young workers, began fleeing to the West, the East Germany economy
was demanding the maximum from its already restive labor force.
   More than 90 percent of working-age women hold jobs.
Unemployment among able-bodied men is officially non-existent. The
country has a 44-hour work week, the longest in Europe.
   The result is an economy that's the envy of its Soviet bloc
neighbors, but also one with increasing problems.
   Top-ranking Communist Party members warned this week of the
growing possibility of labor strikes, which once were unthinkable
in the tightly controlled society.
   The official news agency ADN said Friday that the refugee exodus
had created a ``noticeable decrease of the labor force potential''
and that the current contingent of foreign workers won't be able to
compensate for the loss.
   It put at 85,000 the number of workers from Vietnam, Angola,
Cuba, North Korea, Mozambique and China, but some estimates say the
total is far higher.
   The East German leadership would like to hire 80,000 more
Chinese to fill vacancies, the Viennese daily newspaper Der
Standard said this week.
   About 50,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany since July.
At least 70,000 others have emigrated or refused to return after
being allowed to visit West Germany.
   To make up for the loss, the communist leadership in East Berlin
has increasingly been pressing those left behind to rally around
the socialist system that's also facing burgeoning political
opposition.
   ``Don't forget that there are still enough GDR (East German)
citizens to keep building up the country, and who have the will to
strengthen socialism in the GDR,'' Politburo member Kurt Hager told
West Germany's ZDF television on Thursday in an interview in Moscow.
   Others took up that same theme Friday.
   Besides urging workers to do more, the Berliner Zeitung called
for a ``better mood'' and greater efficiency on the job.
   Harry Tisch, a member of the ruling Politburo and head of the
government-run labor federation, said millions of people are still
``giving their best for socialism.''
   ``Now it's important to use to an even greater degree this
potential, power, readiness, richness of ideas and creativity,''
Tisch said in a commentary in the federation's daily newspaper,
Tribuene.
   As head of the Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, Tisch oversees
the nation's work force of nearly 8.6 million people. Recent
estimates put the country's population at about 16.6 million,
before the refugee exodus.
   East German leader Erich Honecker sounded the same theme Friday,
saying: ``Our motto `work together, plan together, govern together'
is more current than ever.''
   His comments came in a meeting with leaders of political parties
allied with the Communists, held to discuss the recent troubles
that have hit the nation.

<TEXT>
   Investors spooked by a faltering airline buyout
went on a Friday the 13th selling spree that knocked the Dow Jones
industrial average into a 190-point tailspin eerily reminiscent of
the crash of 1987.
   The chilling slide was concentrated in the last hour of trading
Friday, shortly after United Airlines parent UAL Corp. announced
the unraveling of an employee-led $6.75 billion buyout bid that
depended heavily on borrowed cash.
   Nearly $200 billion in paper wealth vanished as investors dumped
stocks and computerized trading programs went into an
across-the-board ``sell'' mode.
   ``It's total emotional and psychological chaos,'' said Eugene
Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady sought to reassure
Americans that the outlook for economic growth remains sound.
   ``It's important to recognize that today's stock market decline
doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the
economy,'' Brady said, noting that the decline followed a 591-point
rise in the Dow industrials since the start of the year.
   President Bush, new Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden and the Federal Reserve all declined comment.
   Nevertheless, some observers saw uncanny parallels with a
108-point Dow drop on a Friday exactly two years ago, which
presaged the record 508-point plunge on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.
   ``Nobody believes in witchcraft,'' Washington economist Michael
Evans said. But he added, ``We're seeing the same type of
phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago.''
   At day's end, the widely watched Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks had plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the
biggest point drop since Black Monday.
   On a percentage basis, Friday's loss was only the 12th worst
ever _ 6.91 percent _ ranking far behind the record 22.6 percent
drop on Black Monday and the 12.8 percent decline on Oct. 28, 1929,
which heralded the start of the Great Depression.
   Other stock indices fell sharply as investors sought refuge in
the relatively safe credit markets. Big investor appetite for bonds
pushed interest rates down to their lowest levels since April 1987.
   Unlike two years ago, when weeks of increasingly volatile
trading preceded the crash, Friday's decline came with little
warning. The Dow already had posted five record highs this month,
and the average was down only about 23 points two hours before the
close of trading.
   At the height of the selloff, the average plummeted a little
more than 100 points in an hour.
   But there were some similarities.
   Two years ago, worries that Congress would restrict in leveraged
buyouts contributed to the market crash. Today, questions over the
ability to finance takeovers has the market spooked.
   Computerized ``program trading'' was blamed in part for the
earlier crash, and analysts said it contributed to the latest dive,
though safeguards installed since October 1987 were said to have
lessened the effect.
   Adding to the feeling of deja vu, the administration and
Congress were wrestling once again with the budget deficit, and a
surge in wholesale prices reported Friday renewed fear that
inflation may worsen.
   Some analysts played down the similarities.
   ``I think it's a one-day panic,'' said economist David Wyss of
DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. ``I think
it's fairly clear the drop was caused by the (United Airlines)
deal.''
   News that financing for the UAL deal had broken down heightened
concerns that the takeover fever supporting stock prices may be
over, brokers said. The buyout of the nation's second-largest
airline would have relied largely on the sale of high-risk,
high-yielding ``junk bonds,'' commonly used to finance leveraged
buyouts.
   ``Leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stock
prices this year ... and if that prop gets removed, stocks would
have to go down,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at
First Albany Corp.
   The market for junk bonds was shaken last month when Canadian
retailing giant Campeau Corp. announced it was unable to make
payments on bonds it issued in buyouts of Allied Stores Corp. and
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Following the 1987 crash, regulators imposed what they called
``circuit breakers'' that automatically limited trading if the Dow
industrials rose or fell 50 points. This restriction was later
expanded to 250 points.
   In Chicago, similar circuit breakers went into effect for the
first time. The Mercantile Exchange said trading of futures on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was halted twice.
   New York Stock Exchange President Richard A. Grasso said the
safeguard, intended to blunt the effect of computerized program
trading, worked ``exceptionally well'' Friday.
   Nevertheless, Janney Montgomery's Peroni said the severe drop
raised worries over what will happen Monday: ``It's bad because it
means that there's going to be two days for fear to fester.''

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 11,000 Vietnamese boat people in
detention centers throughout this British colony today staged a
hunger strike to protest forced repatriation to their communist
homeland, officials reported.
   Nearly all the 7,000 inhabitants in the Shek Kong Detention
Center refused to have breakfast and lunch Saturday, said a police
spokesman on condition of anonymity. She added boat people hung
banners in the camp saying, ``Do not repatriate us to Vietnam.''
   A government spokesman said 4,100 boat people in detention
centers in Shatin and on Lantao Island also stopped eating.
   The actions came before meetings in Geneva Monday and Tuesday
that will review plans to screen Vietnamese boat people and
repatriate those who do not qualify as refugees.
   Under a policy adopted by Hong Kong and many Southeast Asian
nations in June 1988, Vietnamese boat people will be granted
refugee status and resettled overseas only if they can prove they
fled political persecution in Vietnam. Otherwise, they would be
considered illegal immigrants and face repatriation.
   The government spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said pamphlets had been found in some camps urging the boat people
to hold rallies and hunger strikes against the screening policy.
   He said there were no incidents of disorder and the hunger
strikers did not pose any security threat.
   More than 56,000 boat people are in Hong Kong. Two-thirds of
them are kept in the prison-like centers, waiting to be screened.
   In August, Vietnamese battled each other with iron bars, stones
and sharpened objects at one detention center. Seventeen people
were injured.

<TEXT>
   The verdict's in from experts who dug up the
common grave of five Colorado gold prospectors to see who did them
in and ate them up: Alferd Packer was the murderer with an appetite
for his victims.
   ``Guilty as sin,'' intoned James E. Starrs, a professor of law
and forensic science who led an expedition to Lake City, Colo., to
show what experts in archeology, anthropology, pathology and
firearms could learn about misdeeds committed 115 years ago.
   Starrs said Friday the bones provided scientific evidence that
prove Packer ``beyond the shadow of a doubt'' murdered his
colleagues, marooned in the Rocky Mountains during the murderous
winter of 1874, and ate their flesh to stay alive.
   It was a famous case of cannibalism, and the stuff of legends.
   Packer, accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1874, was
convicted of murder in 1883 and of five charges of manslaughter
three years later when the first conviction was overturned on a
technicality.
   He owned up to surviving on the flesh of his fellow travelers,
but said the only one he actually killed was a hunger-crazed
Shannon Wilson Bell.
   He said Bell rushed him with a hatchet when he returned empty
handed from a five-day sortie in search for food. He said Bell had
killed the others and cannibalized them.
   He said he shot Bell in self-defense, finished him off with the
hatchet and then survived the winter through cannibalism.
   But the bones showed contradictory evidence, Starrs said.
   ``It is plain as a pikestaff that Packer was the one who was on
the attack, not Bell,'' he said, explaining that wounds on the
bones of three of the victims ``were caused by a hatchet-like
instrument at a time when these persons were defending themselves
from the attack of an aggressor.''
   He said the marks suggested the victims had raised their arms to
fend off blows.
   Starrs said the angle of the blade marks on the bones from which
the flesh had been taken _ including the bones believed to be
Bell's _ indicated that the cuts were all made by the same person.
That indicates Packer's story is false, and that he's guilty, he
said.
   However, Starrs acknowledged his findings had their limits. He
said, for example, he could not be sure which set of bones was
Bell's.
   Anthropologist Walter H. Birkby of the Arizona State Museum, who
also studied the bones, said he couldn't share Starrs' conclusions.
   ``It could possibly be the right scenario, but scientifically we
cannot substantiate it,'' Birkby said.
   Last summer Birkby went further, saying his study of the remains
actually supported Packer's story.
   No matter what his proclivities toward his fellow man, Packer
has been a fixture in Colorado folk history. His bust has been
displayed in the state capitol.
   Students at the University of Colorado at Boulder named their
student center dining room after Packer.
   Part of his fame comes from a remark Starrs said was never
uttered. Judge Melville Gerry, upon sentencing Packer, supposedly
declared, ``They was sivin Dimmicrats in Hinsdale County, and ye
eat five of them, God damn ye!''
   Starrs said he believes the quotation was made up by a bartender.
   Starrs also came to one conclusion not far off the opinion many
people held in the last century: Packer was a fiend, ``base ...
brutish ... barbaric,'' he said.
   One remaining mystery was cleared up when Duane J. Dillon, a
criminal investigator from Martinez, Calif., concluded Packer
spelled his first name ``A-l-f-e-r-d.''
   He said official records show the name as ``Alfred,'' but
whenever Packer signed a document he used ``Alferd.''

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Jerry Nears Coast; Record Highs Across Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the nation enjoyed unseasonably warm temperatures early
today, while the Gulf Coast region braced for the approach of
Tropical Storm Jerry.
   A hurricane watch was in effect from Texas to the Mississippi
River early today as Jerry appeared set to reach hurricane strength
in the Gulf of Mexico, which was already facing abnormally high
tides.
   Jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the
Mexican coast and late Friday had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph.
   Rain dampened Atlanta early today, but most of the rest of the
nation enjoyed fair weather. Temperatures were in the 60s
throughout much of the East and Midwest.
   On Friday, communities from Baltimore to Cheyenne, Wyo., broke
or tied their record high temperatures for the date. In Cheyenne,
the temperature reached 80 degrees for the first time in 110 years
on that date, while Baltimore tied a 1954 mark when the temperature
reached 88 degrees.
   Lack of rain during the past several weeks along with the
unseasonably hot temperatures brought the fire danger in Colorado
to the extreme category.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 103 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Fans On Both Sides Of Bay Rally For Home Teams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball fever was in full swing on the eve
of the Bay Bridge World Series as thousands of fans turned out at
dueling rallies to urge on the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics.
   At least 15,000 Giants fans jammed into a waterfront plaza in
San Francisco at midday Friday, while some 2,000 A's boosters
turned up later at the Oakland Coliseum plaza.
   Shouts of ``Lets Go, A's'' greeted Manager Tony La Russa,
pitcher Dave Stewart and reliever Dennis Eckersley. They promised
that the American League champions, who lost last year's World
Series 4-1 to the Los Angeles Dodgers, would win this time.
   ``Last year I made a big mistake in the Series,'' said
Eckersley, who gave up a game-losing, two-run homer to Kirk Gibson
with two out in the ninth inning of Game 1. ``And this year I will
redeem myself.''
   La Russa told the crowd it wasn't enough to merely get into the
Series.
   ``We're only going to be happy if we win it,'' the skipper said.
   Across the bay, Giants fans listened to a Dixieland band that
played on a stand decorated with balloons in the team's hues of
orange and black.
   ``They can't stop the black tide,'' Giants pitcher Mike Krukow
told the crowd.
   Fans greeted Krukow, the only member of the team to address the
noon rally, with shouts of ``Kru, Kru, Kru.'' The pitcher finished
the season on the injured list and won't play in the Series.
   The rally also was intended to boost prospects for the proposed
waterfront stadium that would become the team's new home, replacing
windy Candlestick Park.
   Several desks staffed by supporters of the ballpark plan dotted
the area. Fans were urged to sign up as volunteers in a campaign to
get the stadium plan approved on the November ballot.
   ``This is tremendous; people are really getting the spirit,''
said Marge Savo, who wore a Giants cap, team sweater and black
skirt as she sat at one of the desks.

<TEXT>
   The justice minister resigned, citing
deterioration of his health and neglect of his ranch during the six
weeks he held office. An adviser to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
named to replace him.
   A journalist for the Madrid newspaper El Pais took refuge in the
Spanish Embassy Friday, saying he had been threatened with arrest.
   The opposition indicated Friday it would discuss conditions for
new elections.
   Olmedo Miranda was appointed Sept. 3, two days after provisional
President Francisco Rodriguez took office. The provisional
government was created when Noriega annulled the May 7 elections,
which independent observers said the opposition won by a landslide.
   Renato Pereira, a foreign relations expert and adviser to
Noriega, was appointed to replace Miranda after Miranda's
resignation Friday.
   In his resignation letter to Rodriguez, Miranda said: ``I have
faced mainly damage to my health (while in office), and in
addition, I have neglected the duties of my cattle business.''
   His resignation followed government announcements that one-third
of the 140,000 public employees could be fired over the next weeks
under tough new laws against workers deemed disloyal to the
government.
   Many public employees celebrated Oct. 3, when rebellious
military units tried to overthrow Noriega, who as chief of the
Defense Forces controls the country.
   The new measures make it easy for the government to dismiss such
employees. The laws also freeze wages, suspend Christmas bonuses
and forbid any political activity by professional and business
associations.
   The government said the laws were enacted to defend the economy
against ``aggression by the United States.''
   Since Noriega's indictment in February 1988 on U.S. drug
trafficking charges, the United States has applied economic and
political pressure to force the Defense Forces chief to step down.
   Noriega denies the drug charges and says the United States is
trying to avoid complying with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties,
which give Panama control of the waterway at the end of 1999.
   The Spanish journalist, Antonio Cano, said officials called him
at his hotel, criticized a story he had written about Noriega and
threatened him with arrest. He said he wrote a profile with
references to Noriega's personal life.
   Cano, 32, lives in Mexico and has covered Panama since 1984. He
arrived last week to report on the military uprising.
   Government officials were not available for comment on the
reported threats.
   Cano said he called Spanish officials, who took him to the
embassy for protection and were looking for ways to get him out of
the country.
   Former presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said the
opposition was willing to talk with the military about ``another
kind of elections'' but would continue to insist on Noriega's
departure and recognition of its May victory.
   International observers said Endara beat the government
candidate by a 3-1 margin.
   ``We would be willing to hold talks on many grounds,'' Endara
said. ``If Gen. Noriega is willing to leave, we would be willing to
consider what kind of elections could be held.''

<TEXT>
   More than 1,500 people crowded into a sweltering
church to hear former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
eulogized as a man who suffered like Jesus Christ and forgave those
who betrayed him.
   Another 500 people milled outside the Co-Cathedral of St.
Theresa Friday, hoping for a glimpse of Marcos' body Friday evening.
   ``Christ was a victim of the people's power, so Marcos was a
victim of the peoples' power,'' said Roman Catholic Monsignor
Domingo Nebres of the Philippines, referring to the 1986 ``people
power'' revolt that ended Marcos' 20-year dictatorial rule there.
   ``My dear beloved president would say, `Do not cry for me ...
cry for your country,'' Nebres, a friend of Marcos for 12 years,
told those packed into the Honolulu's largest Roman Catholic church.
   After the Mass, Nebres told reporters, ``We cannot imitate
Christ in power, he is God. We can only imitate him in suffering,
which Marcos did.''
   Marcos was hospitalized for nearly nine months before he died
Sept. 28 at the age of 72.
   Last year, he was indicted on U.S. criminal racketeering charges
accusing him of looting millions of dollars from his homeland.
   In exile, he was accused of plotting to overthrow Philippine
President Corazon Aquino, who prohibited him from returning to his
homeland.
   But his widow, Imelda, who still faces the racketeering charges,
has vowed to bring his body home to the Philippines for burial. He
will be entombed Sunday at Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in
what the family calls a temporary resting place.
   Despite being rejected by his people, Marcos was never bitter,
Nebres said. ``He would say `Lord, forgive them, they know not what
they do,''' said the priest, who regularly heard Marcos'
confessions.
   Marcos' coffin, draped with a Philippine flag, was carried into
the church by 10 men in white Philippine military uniforms and
black armbands. Eight were retired generals.
   The procession was led by Col. Arturo Aruiza, a 20-year Marcos
aide and his closest adviser-in-exile.
   Mrs. Marcos arrived with two of her three children, Ferdinand
``Bong Bong'' Marcos Jr. and daughter Irene Araneta, as well as
other relatives including Marcos' sister, Fortuna Barba, and
brother, Pacifico Marcos.
   Marcos eldest daughter, Imee, lives in exile in Morocco.
   The black-clad Mrs. Marcos, who covered her face with a black
veil and clutched a silver rosary, refused to answer reporters'
questions.
   During the service, a tearful Aruiza stood guard near Marcos'
closed coffin, which was surrounded by white flowers and red velvet
ropes to keep mourners from getting too close.
   After the hour-long Mass, the coffin was opened, Mrs. Marcos
kissed the clear plastic covering it and placed a single white lily
there.
   Throngs of mourners, including hundreds who pushed their way
into the church after rain began to fall at the end of the Mass,
filed past the coffin.
   Philippine Consul General to Hawaii Tomas Gomez said there were
no official representatives of the Philippine or U.S. governments
at the funeral.
   However, several Philippine officials attended, including former
Labor Minister Blas Ople and Congressman Roquito Ablan Jr., said
Marcos supporter Joe Lazo.
   Also attending were Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.; Christina Ponce
Enrile, wife of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the former defense
minister; and the wife of Philippine Gen. Fabian Ver, Marcos'
right-hand man during his rule.
   Cojuangco is Mrs. Aquino's cousin, but a longtime Marcos
supporter.

   Carl Elbridge Newton, a Roosevelt administration
official during World War II and lawyer whose clients included
billionaire recluse Howard Hughes, has died at age 91.
   Newton died Thursday at his home.
   A Rhodes Scholar, Newton received his law degree at Harvard and
joined the U.S. attorney's office here in the 1920s.
   He later went into private practice, where he represented Hughes
and helped the Alleghany Corp. in its successful fight for control

   He was president of the railroad from 1942-1945.
   During the same period, he served as deputy coal administrator
under Interior Secretary Harold Ickes when the federal government
took control of the nation's coal mines.
   Newton was a founding member of the New York law firm of Donovan
Leisure Newton &amp; Irvine, with which he remained associated until
his death.
   He also was a distinguished amateur artist whose paintings hung

<HEAD>Administration Redefines Ban on Foreign Assassinations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has decided that
clandestine U.S. operations that threaten the lives of foreign
leaders could be legal despite a ban on assassinations, according
to a published report.
   Without changing an executive order banning assassinations of
foreign leaders, the administration will legally interpret
``assassination'' as referring only to premeditated political
murder, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The new legal ruling, drafted by the Office of the Army Judge
Advocate General, would significantly expand the scope of military
operations the United States could launch legally against
terrorists, drug lords or fugitives abroad, the Times said, citing
unidentified administration officials.
   The ruling comes as the administration weathers congressional
criticism of its handling of last week's failed coup against
Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Under the ruling, the accidental death of Noriega during an
extradition or future coup attempt in which U.S. forces played a
direct role wouldn't constitute assassination, the Times reported.
   Similarly, the death of a hostage-taker during a rescue attempt
by U.S. forces, or a drug trafficker who intervened violently
during a U.S.-assisted raid on narcotics labs abroad, would be
exempt from the assassination order, officials said.
   ``It would just be their bad luck,'' said one official.
   Barred under the order bar is premeditated political murder.
``That means a man standing on a rooftop with a sniper scope aiming
at a predetermined target,'' said one senior administration legal
counsel.
   President Ford's 1975 executive order barring assassination has
been viewed by later administrations as a barrier to covert
intelligence operations that put the lives of targets at risk, the
paper said.
   ``None of the executive orders defined the term assassination,
which created a lot of confusion,'' a Pentagon official said.
``This ruling takes away the excuse for indecision.''
   The ``memorandum of law'' states: ``A decision by the President
to employ overt military force ... would not constitute
assassination if U.S. forces were employed against the combatant
forces of another nation, a guerrilla force, or a terrorist or
other organization whose actions pose a threat to the security of
the United States.''
   In contrast, the last executive order on assassinations, issued
by President Reagan in 1981, states simply: ``No person employed by
or acting on behalf of the United States government shall engage in
or conspire to engage in assassination.''
   It also says that ``no agency of the intelligence community
shall participate in or request any person to undertake activities
forbidden by this order.''
   The new 15-page ruling received input from the CIA, the State
Department, other U.S. agencies and members of Congress.
   One administration official said the ruling was ``the direct
result of the changing international threat, which was previously
viewed in terms of conventional forces but today includes terrorism
and narcoterrorism.''

<HEAD>Pope Arrives At Indian Ocean Island on Final Leg of Eastern Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PLAISANCE, Mauritius (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul ll arrived today for
a two-day stay in this multiparty democracy in which a rainbow of
races and religions co-exist peacefully.
   The Roman Catholic leader landed in cloudy, windy weather on
this volcanic, Indian Ocean island after a 7{-hour flight from
Jakarta, Indonesia.
   Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth greeted the pope with Hindu,
Christian and Moslem members of his government.
   John Paul's weekend stop follows a politically sensitive Asian
pilgrimage in which he was called to speak out on human rights
issues in South Korea and Indonesia.
   On Sunday, John Paul will visit the 50-square-mile island of
Rodrigues, 500 miles to the east, before returning to Rome Monday.
   At his final stops on his tour of Indonesia on Friday, John Paul
stressed the Catholic Church's family and social teachings while
acknowledging difficulties faced by Indonesia's Christians.
   He continued to use guarded language when referring to potential
controversial issues involving the government or the 157
million-member Moslem community in the world's most populous Moslem
country.
   His final Indonesian Mass was attended by 100,000 people Friday
amid lush coffee and palm oil plantations in North Sumatra. Later
he addressed Indonesia's 42 bishops in Jakarta, the capital.
   John Paul urged Catholics to be bold in proclaiming Christian
values. He acknowledged ``occasional difficulties'' facing the 5
million Catholics in Indonesia but reminded them religious freedom
is protected by Indonesia's constitution.
   In Mauritius, Hindus account for just over half of its 1 million
people. About 320,000 are Catholics and 16 percent are Moslems.
Hindus and Moslems emigrated from India in the 19th century to
Mauritius, 1,000 miles east of the African mainland.
   Catholicism was brought by the French when they settled in 1721.
The British gained control and granted Mauritius independence in
1968.
   It has a multiparty parliamentary democracy, a free press and a
commitment to separation of religion and state.
   Cardinal Jean Margeot, head of the nation's Catholics, addressed
a letter to all Mauritians asking them to welcome the pope ``as a
pilgrim of peace.''
   ``May each of the different groups of our society keep its own
identity, like the colors of the rainbow, and seek elevation
mutually,'' said Margeot.
   ``Unity in diversity,'' is the motto of the prime minister, Sir
Anerood Jugnauth, 59, a Hindu who has five Catholics in his Cabinet
and a picture of the pope on his office wall.
   However, Hindus twice tried to assassinate Jugnauth after he
launched a crackdown against the drug trade last year.
   But Margeot said he will have good news for the pope about
Mauritius, which has almost full employment and a real growth rate
that has averaged 7 percent in recent years.
   ``We are changing from a rural economy based on agriculture to
accelerated industrialization,'' the cardinal said.
   Most of the population are Creoles, whose skin color ranges from
fairest white to darkest black, with racial features of Europeans,
Africans and Indians, and a touch of Chinese. All the ethnic
variety of the Indian subcontinent is also represented.
   Mauritius is considered a shining example of peaceful
coexistence. American novelist Mark Twain once described it as the
model for paradise.

only ``Sheep run north, sir'' after being abandoned in this New
York City suburb.
   Twenty Pace University students were charged with disorderly
conduct early Friday after the wild and woolly fraternity prank in
which they answered all questions from police with just that
phrase, authorities said.
   The incident began around midnight when brothers of Delta Kappa
Epsilon drove their blindfolded pledges up near the Croton Dam and
dropped them off with no identification and no money, police said.
   They did give the pledges some advice _ if anyone asks you
anything, reply, ``Sheep run north, sir.'' The pledges responded
like, well, sheep.
   The pledges were walking back to school when Officer Richard
Garrett spotted them along a highway and decided to investigate.
   Garrett asked for identification. ``Sheep run north, sir!'' they
replied.
   He asked what they were doing on the highway at 2 a.m. ``Sheep
run north, sir!'' they replied.
   He called for reinforcements and arrested them all. ``Sheep run
north, sir!'' they told the arriving officers.
   The police began strip-searching everybody and locking them in
cells. ``We're college students!'' they responded _ but only after
a half-dozen were already behind bars.
   They were given disorderly conduct tickets, and released in the
custody of Pace's assistant dean of students, Robert Haywood.

   Bloomfield, Iowa, needs another signature in
the guest book at its Welcome Center, but not from just anyone.
   To make sure it gets a name from the only state not represented
in the book, the town is sponsoring a Delaware contest. The prize
is an all-expense paid, three-day trip for two to Bloomfield _
population 2,700.
   And, oh, what a weekend it will be. The winners will stay at
Motel 63, tool around in a donated car with $15 free gas, $50 of
gift certicates and receive free newspapers while they are there.
   To win the trip and goodies, Delaware residents must submit an
essay of 50 words or less to the Davis County Tourism Corp. on
``Why I would like to visit Davis County, Iowa.''
   Nancy Schneider, president of the 3-year-old non-profit tourism
corporation, said she received a call Friday morning from a man in
Delaware who said he plans to be the first to sign the book because
he'll be in Iowa next week.
   ``He was told that in order to get the royal treatment, he'll
have to enter the contest,'' Schneider said in a telephone
interview.
   According to the guest book, people from 49 states, about 35
countries and all of the Canadian provinces have visited
Bloomfield, about 75 miles southeast of Des Moines.

<HEAD>Pinochet Says He Will Abolish Chile's Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet
announced he will abolish the country's feared secret police before
an elected civilian government takes power in March.
   Pinochet made the surprise statement Friday during an appearance
in Coihaique, 1,350 miles south of Santiago, the capital.
   Without elaborating, Pinochet said the secret police, known by
their Spanish-language acronym CNI, would be dissolved before the
military junta that has ruled Chile since a 1973 coup steps aside.
   Human rights organizations have accused the secret police of
using torture and committing other abuses against members of the
country's opposition.
   Pinochet also said Friday that Chile's armed forces would not
allow members of the military to be tried for alleged human rights
abuses by the civilian government.
   Centrist politician Patricio Aylwin, the opposition's candidate
for president, is favored to defeat government candidate Hernan
Buchi _ Pinochet's former finance minister _ in Dec. 14 balloting.
The new president will be installed March 11.
   Opposition members have called for the prosecution of military
officers accused of human rights abuses.
   But Pinochet said the military would not permit its members to
be ``scorned and humiliated for actions destined to save Chile.''
   More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested,
tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repression
after Pinochet and other military officers ousted elected civilian
President Salvador Allende. In recent years, violent repression has
declined significantly but some acts against dissidents continue,
human rights groups contend.
   In a referendum on Oct. 5, 1988, Chileans rejected the
73-year-old army commander's bid to extend his rule until 1997.
   Under terms of a 1980 constitution, the vote cleared the way for
open presidential elections.
   Pinochet has said he will remain army commander after he leaves
the presidency. Under the constitution crafted by his
administration, Pinochet and other military chiefs are entitled to
their commands until 1998.

<HEAD>Uproar Follows Exam Given by Civil Rights Activist on Yom Kippur</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish students at the University of
California at Berkeley have demanded a formal apology from
sociology professor Harry Edwards for his refusal to cancel an exam
scheduled on Yom Kippur.
   Edwards, a prominent civil rights advocate, gave the exam on
Monday, the Jewish Day of Atonement, despite pleas from 47 students
in his 500-student introductory sociology class.
   Edwards refused to reschedule the exam, saying if he made an
exception for Yom Kippur he would have to make exceptions for
numerous other religions.
   As an alternative, Edwards told students who wanted to observe
the most sacred of Jewish holidays to write a long paper, but some
students considered that an unfair option.
   ``I don't believe he is anti-Semitic,'' said sociology student
Naomi Snyder, who did not attend synagogue or fast on the holiday
because she decided to take the exam. ``I do believe he is
insensitive.''
   Edwards, who did not immediately return phone calls, was quoted
in other news reports as saying he disregarded holidays that were
not on the university calendar.
   Edwards organized the clenched-fist protest by black athletes at
the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City and more recently has
consulted on affirmative action issues for football's San Francisco
49ers, basketball's Golden State Warriors and former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth.
   ``It's ironic that as a civil rights leader and a person whose
job it is to educate students about diversity that he was so
outright close-minded about accommodating Jewish students,'' said
Shana Silverberg, president of the university's Jewish Student
Board.
   Silverberg said her group and the Berkeley Hillel Foundation
were requesting a meeting with Edwards to discuss the episode.

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't in the original score, but the
youngest son of renowned violinst Isaac Stern is following in the
footsteps of his older brother and taking up the baton as a career.
   David Stern, 26, who graduated this year from the Juilliard
School in New York City, will make his conducting debut today with
the Yale Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra will perform Schubert's
Symphony No. 8 and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5.
   Stern, a pianist, was asked to take over as interim music
director for a year after the abrupt departure of Alasdair Neale,
who left last spring to become assistant conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
   To keep the job with the undergraduate orchestra, Stern will
have to compete with other candidates in auditions next year.
   A 1986 graduate of Yale, Stern called the position a ``great,
great job'' for a young conductor. Past directors have gone on to
work with well known orchestras, but Stern said he's concentrating
strictly on his present job.
   ``This is an orchestra that judges it conductors very severely.
They demand quality and the demand attention, and they demand
seriousness. I am trying to earn my keep not only with my superiors
to which I answer but also to the orchestra,'' he said.
   Neither David nor his brother, Michael, 29, who is assistant
conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, were encouraged by their
father to think of music as a career, David said. Their sister,
Shira, 33, is a rabbi.
   ``My father did not push us into music,'' he said. ``The love
for music was something that was ingrained in us when we were very
young, and I think he was very happy when we chose it. But we chose
it very late.''
   David learned the piano at an early age. In high school, he said
he intended to focus on science, but ``somehow I got involved in
the music department and getting more and more involved in music.''
   He played in a jazz band and also performed chamber music. But
when he started college, he still wasn't thinking of a career in
music.
   As a freshman, Stern was an assistant to the director of the
Bach Society Orchestra and Chorus, an undergraduate organization
run by students. When the director quit during his sophomore year,
he took over, and the course was set.
   He enrolled in the Yale School of Music for conducting studies
under Otto-Werner Mueller, and then followed Mueller to New York
when he joined the Juilliard faculty.
   Stern says his father's status has posed some challenges. He
said he has been offered some positions, such as assistantships,
which have been ``ridiculously out of proportion.''
   ``I have had to say, `I'm sorry, I'm not ready for this,''' he
said.

   Mayor Andrew Young has agreed to take a
consulting job with a political supporter when his term expires at
the end of the year.
   The arrangement will allow Young to spend most of his time in
1990 campaigning for governor, said Stoney Cooks, a supporter.
   The mayor has been hired as a consultant for R.K. Sehgal,
chairman of the engineering firm Law Companies Group and a backer
of the mayor's gubernatorial campaign, Nehl Horton, a campaign
aide, said Friday.
   The salary was not disclosed. Young earns $65,000 a year as
mayor.
   Young will serve as an executive consultant for a Law
subsidiary, Law International Companies Group, lending the firm his
extensive international experience. Young served as ambassador to
the United Nations under President Carter.
   Law recently merged with a British firm to increase its overseas
business. The firm has 3,400 employees worldwide, including Africa
and the Middle East.
   Should Young be elected governor in November 1990, his agreement
with Law would end. He has not formally announced his candidacy yet.
   City and company officials said Law has no contracts with the
city.

<HEAD>Six Men Survive 40 Hours in Pacific After Boat Sinks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six men survived 40 hours in the Pacific Ocean
by fashioning a makeshift raft out of buoys and nets from their
sunken fishing boat, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Washington rescued the men Friday after a
helicopter spotted them bobbing 50 miles northwest of Maui Island,
spokesman Lt. Brad Nelson said.
   The men suffered only bruises and mild dehydration, Nelson said.
   ``They were all in the water, clinging to the raft,'' said
helicopter pilot Lt. Michael Andres, who first spotted the men.
``They were waving and giving us the thumbs-up sign and we motioned
back to them to tell them that the cutter was on the way.''
   The Coast Guard identified the sailors as skipper Kim H. Kyu,
49; Jim Alexander, 22; George Shohswel, 22; Chong S. Yoon, 39; Osa
A. Tui, 42, and John Aignua, 39.
   They were greeted by relatives and friends with hugs and tears
when the Washington returned them to Honolulu Harbor. The men
declined to be interviewed.
   The Coast Guard and Navy searched 70,000 square miles for the
men after the 60-foot long-line fishing boat Sin Hyung radioed it
was taking on water and breaking up Wednesday evening.
   The Sin Hyung sailed from Honolulu on Oct. 3.
   Lt. Dan Nelson, skipper of the Washington, said the fishing boat
carried no flares or emergency radio transmitters and apparently
had no life jackets.
   ``They were real smart to use those buoys,'' Andres said. ``But
we would have found them a lot sooner if they had flares or an
emergency beacon.''

   A pair of competitors in the Great Race
West, a classic car competition, ran head-on into Friday the 13th,
a publicist for the event said.
   David and Laura Northrop of Redlands, Calif., driving car number
13, a 1930 Ford Phaeton, crossed the day's finish line in 13th

between Long Beach and Sparks, Nev.
   They also began the day's rally in 13th place, he said.
   And when they finished, their speedometer was stuck _ you
guessed it _ at the 13 mph mark.
   ``I swear that this happened,'' said Cole. ``If I hadn't seen it
myself, I wouldn't have believed it.''
   He said the Northrops made no attempt during the 325-mile leg
from Avila Beach to Vallejo to maintain their race position.
   ``They are pretty good racers,'' he said. ``They would much
rather win.''
   The rally is scheduled to end Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has given final approval to a
$78 million settlement of a class action lawsuit over radioactive
pollution from the federal government's Fernald uranium processing
plant.
   U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin ruled Friday that the
settlement with 14,000 residents and businesses within five miles
of the plant leaves Mobil Mining &amp; Minerals Co., which has an
operation near the plant, free to sue the U.S. Department of Energy
to recover costs of cleaning up radioactive pollution on Mobil
property.
   District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ruled earlier this month that
the settlement offered by the federal government, which owns the
Feed Materials Processing Center, was reasonable for resolving the
class-action claim.
   The plaintiffs said radioactive pollution had reduced their
property values and inflicted emotional suffering. The plant has
processed uranium for use in nuclear reactors and weapons since
1952.
   Mobil and Rutgers-Nease Chemical Co., commercial neighbors of
the plant, had objected to the settlement because they feared it
could block lawsuits they might file for repayment from the federal
government if the state were to order the companies to clean up
pollution on their properties.
   Spiegel ruled that the settlement did not prevent Rutgers-Nease
from filing such suits, but he removed himself from ruling on the
Mobil claim because his family owns Mobil stock.
   The settlement calls for the Energy Department to deposit $73
million in a court-supervised fund for the neighbors by Oct. 15.
The department has promised to pay another $5 million for valid
claims of lost commercial property value.

<HEAD>India Delays Withdrawal of Troops From Eastern Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India postponed the withdrawal of its
peacekeeping troops in eastern Sri Lanka after a dispute over who
will provide security in the violence-wracked area, officials said
today.
   About 5,000 Indian soldiers had been expected to leave eastern
Ampara district Monday, military sources said. But an Indian High
Commission official said the troops would remain in the district,
125 miles east of Colombo.
   ``The problem of the withdrawal from Ampara is because nothing
has been sorted out about who will take over security of the
district when the Indian Peacekeeping Force pulls out. Will it be
the Sri Lankan army, the police or the civil volunteer force?'' the
official said on condition of anonymity.
   India sent an estimated 47,000 troops to Sri Lanka in July 1987
to supervise an arms surrender of Tamil guerrillas fighting for an
independent homeland in the north and east.
   But the rebels turned their guns on the Indian soldiers, whose
presence also triggered a bloody backlash by Sinhalese radicals.
The ultranationalists argued the government made too many
concessions to the Tamils and, they said, the Indian troops
threatened Sri Lankan sovereignty.
   India has said all its soldiers will leave the island by Dec. 31.
   Foreign Minister Rajan Wijeratne said Friday some Indian troops
would board ships in eastern Trincomalee Harbor and return home
Monday under a withdrawal plan worked out by top military officials
from the neighboring countries.
   But Indian diplomats and Sri Lanka military officials who cannot
be identified under briefing rules, said the pullout was delayed.
   ``The action plan to fill the vacuum when the Indian troops
leave has not been sorted out,'' said one Indian diplomat on
condition of anonymity. ``We have not got any response from the Sri
Lanka government about who is taking over when the Peacekeeping
Force leaves.''
   The Northeast Provincial Council, headed by a former Tamil rebel
group known as the Eelam People's Revolutionary Front, has
organized a volunteer force of mostly Tamil and Moslem civilians to
take over when the Indian soldiers leave.
   The front also said it plans to organize a 30,000-strong Tamil
army to take over security operations in the area. But Wijeratne
said the Sri Lankan army and police would take over after Indian
soldiers leave.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa had demanded that all Indian
soldiers leave Sri Lanka by July 29, the second anniversary of the
signing of the peace accord. But Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
refused, saying a hasty pullout could lead to more bloodshed.
   The crisis was averted after India made a token pullout and the
two governments later reached an agreement for the withdrawal of
the remaining troops.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people. They claim they are denied jobs and
education by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and dominate the government and military.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died since the Tamil insurgency began in 1983. Another 5,000 have
been killed in the 2-year-old Sinhalese rebellion.

<HEAD>Friday the 13th Viruses Sicken Some Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Friday the 13th computer virus turned out to be something
less than an epidemic, but one computer expert said today that
public fascination with the quirky ailment may heighten interest in
computer security.
   Reports so far indicated infections at 75 sites worldwide by a
pair of viruses designed to strike Friday the 13th, said Wes
Thomas, editor of an electronic newsletter called Virus Alert.
Those 75 sites, mostly businesses and universities, account for
hundreds of computers, he said.
   Thomas, who set up a command center in San Francisco to
coordinate reports of the viruses and the response, said he hadn't
heard of any serious damage done, but said corporate computer
managers were close-mouthed about data loss.
   ``People don't want to admit that,'' Thomas said after a night
of monitoring calls.
   ``It's obviously not a massive infestation,'' Thomas said,
adding that most of the reported cases had yet to be checked by
experts.
   Viruses are malicious programs written by techno-vandals. The
bugs are spread by unknowing users through infected computer disks
or contaminated programs drawn from telephone bulletin boards or
computer networks. They can sap computing power, fill up storage
space, devour files or make information impossible to get.
   In Britain, the Royal National Institution for the Blind
reported a computer malfuction that was most likely caused by a
virus, according to Bernard Fleming, community education officer.
   ``We found that most of our program files are gone. Every time
we try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of our
eyes,'' said Corri Barrett of the institute in London. ``It's
horrendous. Months and months of work has been wiped out here.''
   In Switzerland, Bernhard Schmid, head of the federal personal
computer team, said several dozen of the government's 3,500
personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus but
experts managed to cancel and reprogram all the infected ones.
   A virus was detected earlier in the week in personal computers
at Mobil Corp. offices in Tyler, Texas, and Houston, said Gale
Maynor, who runs the company's computer support services in Dallas.
   The bug erupted early because managers advanced their computers'
clocks to smoke it out, she said. Vital data was duplicated in
advance, she said.
   To Thomas, the non-epidemic may have the unexpected benefit of
raising computer users' awareness of the possibility of a virus.
   ``There are a number of viruses and they could hit at any
time,'' he said. ``The trouble is there are not a lot of people
trained to recognize this.''
   His advice to users who notice their machines acting strangely
is to shut the computer off and call an expert to diagnose the
problem.
   About 30 viruses are known to exist. They are often triggered by
computers' internal calendars, and Friday the 13th is a favorite
target date.
   A virus known as Datacrime or the Columbus Day virus was
supposed to be activated on the 13th. It erases a computer's
``track zero,'' the part of the memory the machine uses to locate
files.
   Another that has been around for some time, called the
Jerusalem, the Israeli or the PLO virus, kicks in Friday the 13th.
Its action is described by various computer experts as destroying
files or expanding applications programs, causing them to
malfunction.

<HEAD>Activists Rally to Celebrate Prisoner Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with details of marches taking place;

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of activists
nationwide took part in ``victory marches'' today celebrating the
imminent release of eight major anti-apartheid leaders.
   In Johannesburg, marchers carried hundreds of posters in support
of the outlawed African National Congress and chanted as they
paraded through the city center to a rally at a university campus.
   There also were peaceful marches in Cape Town, Durban, Port
Elizabeth and several smaller cities.
   The government announced Tuesday that ANC leader Walter Sisulu,
77, and seven other jailed anti-apartheid leaders would be freed.
It was expected the eight, ranging in age from 60 to 80, would be
freed on Sunday.
   The most prominent jailed ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, will
remain in prison, but his release is expected within the next few
months unless the government fears widespread disorder would ensue.
   Sisulu, Mandela and four other prisoners about to be freed were
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for planning a sabotage
campaign to undermine the white-minority government.
   The marches initially were planned as protests against labor
legislation, which black trade unions view as an attempt to cripple
their ability to strike.Anti-apartheid leaders later declared the
rallies also would be ``victory marches.''
   ``We are the majority,'' Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, told an estimated 10,000
marchers in Johannesburg. ``We represent the future of South
Africa.''
   More than 10,000 activists rallied in Port Elizabeth, despite a
pamphlet distributed in abjoining black townships late Friday
suggesting marchers would be exposed to invisible radiation rays.
   About 2,000 blacks marched in Bloemfontein. It was one of the
few mass protests ever in the conservative provincial capital of
the Orange Free State.
   An estimated 8,000 people, including hundreds of striking
brewery workers, marched in Cape Town and thousands more in the
Natal Province cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg.
   ``Eight is not Enough _ Free Mandela,'' read one banner in Cape
Town.
   In most cities, the number of marchers was well below
predictions by protest organizers. Anti-apartheid leaders had said
250,000 would rally nationwide, but preliminary reports indicated
the actual figure would be less than 75,000.
   Sisulu, 77, a political strategist of Mandela's African National
Congress, and five jailed colleagues were flown Friday from a Cape
Town prison to their hometown of Johannesburg, according to airline
personnel.
   The men reportedly were being held at Diepkloof Prison, near the
huge black township of Soweto, where most of them live.
   Another prisoner, Raymond Mhlaba, was flown from Cape Town to
his southern hometown, Port Elizabeth. The eighth prisoner,
80-year-old Oscar Mpetha, was at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape
Town, his hometown.
   The decision by President F.W. de Klerk to release the activists
won praise in South Africa and abroad. De Klerk, who has been
president since August, says he wants to end racial discrimination
and negotiate a new constitution to include the black majority in
national government.
   But black leaders say further concessions are needed before
negotiations can begin. They want an end to the state of emergency,
legalization of banned political groups and the remaining
discriminatory laws to be scrapped.
   The other soon-to-be-freed prisoners who were tried along with
Sisulu and Mandela at the Rivonia treason trial in 1964 are Ahmed
Kathrada, 60, Elias Motsoaledi, 65, Andrew Mlengi, 63, and Mhlaba,
69.
   Also to be freed are ANC leaders Mpetha and Wilton Mkwayi, 67,
along with Jafta Masemola, 60, of the Pan Africanist Congress
guerrilla movement.
   All have been imprisoned for 25 years except Mpetha, who is
nearing the end of a five-year term.
   When they are released, the seven ANC members are expected to
seek permission to travel to the guerrilla movement's headquarters
in Lusaka, Zambia.

<HEAD>Sony Sues Warner Bros. in Bid to Hire Producers of ``Batman'' and
``Rainman''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said today that it has filed a $100
million suit against Warner Bros. Inc., the latest salvo in the
electronics giant's bid to hire a pair of famous film producers to
head its new movie company.
   The suit follows a $1 billion lawsuit filed by earlier by Warner
Bros., which wants to keep Sony from hiring producers Peter Guber
and Jon Peters. The two men made the hit movie ``Batman'' for
Warner Bros. and have a long-term production deal with the company.
   Sony USA Inc., Guber and Peters and their production companies
jointly filed the lawsuit against Warner Bros. in California
Superior Court in Los Angeles on Friday, Sony Corp. said in a
statement.
   Sony, the Japanese electronics and record giant, announced Sept.
27 that it had agreed to buy Columbia Pictures for about $3.4
billion.
   The company said it intends to name Guber and Peters co-chairmen
of the company once it is acquired. Sony also has begun a tender
offer to buy The Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million.
   Warner Bros. sued Sony and others for $1 billion in damages over
Sony's courtship of Guber and Peters to run Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc.
   ``Our suit is against Warner Bros., Inc., Steven Ross, chairman
of its parent company Warner Communications Co., Terry Semel and
Robert Daly for their violation of contracts, illegal conduct and
unfair competition,'' said a Sony official in Tokyo who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Our company had been negotiating with Warner Bros. Inc. in an
attempt to reach agreement ... and it is very regretful that Warner
Bros. filed a suit against us,'' he said.
   But he said the two sides would continue attempts to reach an
agreement regardless of the lawsuits.
   ``We are confident that Warner cannot stop the two (Guber and
Peters) from becoming involved in management of Columbia Pictures,
and we strongly believe that the court will be on our side,'' said
the statement from Sony's Tokyo headquarters.
   Warner Bros. said Guber and Peters, who also produced the
Oscar-winning ``Rainman,'' recently signed a five-year agreement to
make films for Warner.
   In its suit, Warner accused Sony of inducing the two executives
to breach their agreement so they could take top jobs at Columbia.

<HEAD>Arsonists Kill Seven Children, Five Others in Eviction Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arsonists seeking to evict squatters
from a shantytown on the outskirts of the capital set fires that
killed at least 12 people and left 2,000 homeless, police said
today.
   About 30 people were injured in Friday's blazes, according to
hospital sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The fires
destroyed about 300 mud-and-straw huts, most of which were built in
the past five months by poor people who had been evicted from
similar shantytowns in the heart of Dhaka.
   ``The arsonists held a meeting before dousing the huts with
gasoline and kerosene. They also exploded some firebombs to keep
the slum people inside their huts,'' a police officer at Mirpur
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said two firemen were beaten by ``miscreants'' who blocked
their efforts to control the fire.
   Most of those who died were trapped in their burning huts. Seven
children were among the dead.
   The death toll initially was put at eight, but more bodies were
discovered overnight and after daybreak.
   Police detained 20 people on arson charges and said they were
looking for more. Interior Minister Mahmudul Hasan, who visited the
Kalayyanpur slum late Friday night, ordered ``stern action''
against the arsonists.
   About 200 people, many of them students from a nearby college
and school, were involved in setting the fire and were supported by
local strongmen, police said. Both residents and police said the
institutions were claiming the land.
   The police officer at Mirpur, which is just north of Dhaka, said
the shantytown residents were evicted from a slum in central Dhaka
about five months ago as part of a city beautification campaign.
   Almost one-third of Dhaka's 6 million people live in slums and
shantytowns.

<NOTE>Bolar's Nitrofurantoin Targeted by FDA</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it wants
to withdraw Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.'s approval to sell a generic
drug used to treat urinary tract infections and it wants the
company to withdraw the product from drugstores.
   In a letter to the company, the FDA said tests on samples of
Bolar's drug and the brand-name drug ``strongly suggest that
Norwich-Eaton's Macrodantin product was substituted for Bolar's
product'' in tests required for FDA approval.
   The FDA is also moving to change its listing of Bolar's version
of Macrodantin, generically called nitrofurantoin, to indicate to
physicians that the agency does not consider the product to be
therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name drug.
   At the FDA's request, Bolar last weekend agreed to recall its
nitrofurantoin from wholesalers. However, the FDA said it planned
to recommend legal action to force the company to withdraw the
product from pharmacy shelves as well.
   Officials of the Copiague, N.Y.-based company could not be
reached for comment.
   The FDA is investigating other product-switching allegations
against Bolar, including one involving the company's version of the
high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide. A federal criminal investigation
is also under way into the matter.
   The FDA does not have the authority to remove a drug from the
market. If a company does not comply with a recall request, the
agency can only force a recall in court.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was scheduled
to depart on a six-day trip to the Soviet Union today to discuss
crime fighting tactics with Soviet officials and the American legal
system with law students.
   The trip by Thornburgh and a group of aides is being billed as
the first official visit to the Soviet Union.
   The attorney general said his discussions with Soviet legal
authorities would include ``joint law enforcement concerns in the
fields of drugs and organized crime.''
   ``It is my hope that through this visit we can establish a
continuing dialogue between U.S. and Soviet legal officials on
matters of common concern and interest,'' Thornburgh said in a
statement issued Friday.
   ``We have been asked to discuss with Soviet officials such
issues as human rights, the role of the judiciary and commercial
and regulatory law, including environmental law,'' said Thornburgh.
   The attorney general also plans to meet at the U.S. Embassy with
Soviet dissidents and human rights activists, said spokesman David
Runkel.
   Soviet emigration is also expected to be a topic of discussion
between Thornburgh and Soviet officials. The department has
expressed a desire to move the processing of Soviet refugees by
Immigration and Naturalization Ser vice officials from Rome to
Moscow.

<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has agreed to allow almost
1,000 of its citizens who have taken refuge in Poland to emigrate
to the country of their choice, Poland said today.
   The state news agency PAP said East German Deputy Foreign
Minister Harry Ott met with Polish officials and worked out the
solution to the refugee problem.
   The refugees, including many families with small children, had
made their way to Poland after more than 1,400 East Germans left
for the West on Oct. 1 and Oct. 5.
   The exodus from Poland was part of a larger flood of East German
refugees fleeing West through Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The
deluge of an estimated 50,000 refugees since July has shaken East
Germany's hard-line government.
   Diplomatic sources today put the number of refugees in the West
German Embassy or at shelters in Poland at more than 950.
   The earlier groups of refugees left by special East German
trains sent to Poland. The PAP announcement said that this time,
the refugees would be allowed to go to any country they choose
after obtaining proper documents from the East German Embassy.
   It was unclear if the arrangement would apply to other East
Germans who make their way to Poland. Despite East Germany's
attempts to limit travel to Poland, an average of about 120
refugees a day have been arriving at the Warsaw embassy.
   Although Poland maintains it is trying to prevent illegal border
crossings from East Germany, it does not check the documents of
those who make it into Poland. Polish officials have been working
privately with the Roman Catholic Church and the Red Cross to
provide comfortable housing for the refugees.
   The East German ambassador to Poland visited the West German
Embassy just before the announcement on PAP, diplomatic sources
said.
   A group of about 40 East German refugees who apparently had just
arrived were seen today carrying their belongings out of the West
German Embassy and boarding a chartered city bus to a temporary
shelter in Konstancin, about 12 miles from Warsaw.
   ``Everything is O.K.,'' a West German Red Cross official told
the group. ``Don't be afraid,'' another refugee said to his
countrymen as they walked to the bus.
   Inside the embassy, another group of refugees appeared to be
preparing to depart in another waiting bus.
   It was not clear when the refugees would leave for the West.
West Germany's ZDF television network reported from Warsaw that
buses had been arranged but no firm plans had been announced.
   East Germany conceded Friday that the exodus of more than
100,000 of its young and skilled citizens in the past year has cut
significantly into its labor force, and it called on those who have
stayed behind to close the gap.
   ``We certainly can do more, indeed a lot more,'' the state
newspaper Berliner Zeitung urged the country's workers.
   In East Berlin Friday, the state news agency ADN announced that
all but 11 of the estimated 1,000 protesters who were jailed after
pro-democracy demonstrations last week and on Monday had been
released.
   Also Friday, a high-ranking East German official, Dietmar
Keller, spoke openly when asked about speculation of a possible
resignation of hard-line leader Erich Honecker, 77.
   ``As for Erich Honecker's resignation, Erich Honecker must make
that decision all alone,'' Keller, the No. 2 official in the
Culture Ministry, told a news conference in Wolfenbuettel, West
Germany.
   Keller added that any decision about Honecker's political fate
would require a meeting of the Central Committee.
   ``I don't know if a meeting is planned or already called,'' he
said.
   ``But if the majority of the Central Committee is of the opinion
that major changes are necessary, which is absolutely normal in the
world and in politics, then the required decision will be reached.''
   East German officials usually dismiss all questions about the
possibility Honecker could step down or be removed as
``provocative,'' in contrast to Keller's polite explanation of
procedures needed to make a change at the top.
   Honecker's unyielding course has come under increasing criticism
at home.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans took to the streets in
pro-democracy protests during and after the nation's 40th
anniversary celebrations last week. The demonstrators insist they
are staying in East Germany to seek democratic and economic reforms.

   The second Colombian to be extradited to the United

authorities said.
   Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 37, was flown into Miami aboard a U.S.
government aircraft and transferred to a federal women's detention
center in suburban Miami for a court appearance by Monday.
   Colombia has been rocked by bombings blamed for at least 10
deaths and more than 140 injuries since President Virgilio Barco
announced an anti-drug push Aug. 19 and drug barons responded by
declaring a war of their own.
   Drug traffickers have been blamed in the recent shooting deaths
of two employees of the anti-drug crusading Colombian newspaper El
Espectador.
   Rodriguez, who was arrested last month, is not on a U.S. list of
the 12 most wanted Colombian traffickers. Neither was Eduardo
Martinez Romero, who was sent to Atlanta Sept. 6 to face federal
money laudering charges.

<HEAD>Lebanese Legislators Debate Syrian Presence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese legislators wrangled today
over a peace plan for their war-plagued country and appeared unable
to agree on ending Syria's military presence in their country.
   Conference sources said the legislators, meeting since Sept. 30,
narrowed their problems to the Syrian issue after a 17-member
parliamentary task force approved an amended draft for political
reforms during an all-night session.
   Michel Sassin, an Orthodox Christian deputy who is a member of
the committee, said the debates have ``reached an advanced stage in
the ... inter-Lebanese conciliation.'' He would not elaborate.
   The tentative approval of the first chapter of the Arab
League-proposed Lebanon peace plan drew ``cautious optimism'' from
the participants, the sources said, noting that deputies had
reneged on several previous accords after contacts with warlords
and militia chieftains in Beirut.
   The Lebanese civil war, which has raged for 14 years, has eroded
government authority and allowed militia factions to take control
of the streets. Consent of these factions is necessary for the
success of any accord that may be reached in Taif.
   One source said: ``They reach a consensus and then get a
telephone call from Beirut, and we are back where we started.''
   The sources, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity,
explained that the second chapter of the peace plan _ which deals
with the necessity of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon _ had been
approved by all the participants without exception.
   But the deputies remained divided over the third and fourth
chapters of the plan _ ``Lebanese sovereignty'' and relations with
Syria. The plan was proposed by an Arab committee comprised of
Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.
   The Christians are demanding written guarantees for a total
Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. The Moslems have approved a phased
pullback from the Beirut area to be completed in two years,
followed by an evacuation after the conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese
peace pact.
   A hard-line Christian deputy, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a political reforms accord ``would be ink on
paper'' if no satisfactory solution is reached on the issue of
sovereignty and a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Once the committee completes its debates the draft four-chapter
plan would be submitted to a plenary session for approval.
Parliament then will take the document back to Beirut for
ratification at a session to be held in the Lebanese capital.
   The reforms envisaged by the Arab committee are designed to
redistribute power betwen Christians and Moslems and prepare for
the later stage of abolishing the sectarian system, in force since
independence from France in 1943.
   Christians then were considered the majority and given the upper
hand in the government, Parliament, army and judiciary. Moslems now
are believed to comprise a majority of Lebanon's estimated 4
million people.

<TEXT>
   Syria admitted today that an air force
pilot who landed his Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter jet in Israel this
week was a defector, and branded him ``an abominable traitor and an
Israeli spy.''
   Syria earlier had claimed that Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel was
forced to land in northern Israel on Wednesday because of a
technical problem. Today, a military spokesman said the officer had
misled Syrian observation posts.
   ``He maneuvered in a way to indicate that his plane was facing
technical troubles,'' the unnamed spokesman told the official
Syrian Arab News Agency, SANA.
   ``Then he changed course and headed toward the occupied
territories to land in the Israeli Megiddo airport, selling himself
and his aircraft to the enemy,'' the spokesman said.
   On Wednesday, an official source said Adel's plane landed in
Israel with smoke pouring out of its engine. Damascus later
requested the assistance of the International Red Cross in
obtaining the repatriation of both the pilot and the plane.
   Adel, 34, told a news conference in Israel on Friday that he
defected in search of freedom and democracy and that he would not
meet with any Red Cross representatives if their aim is to take him
back to Syria.
   He was on a training mission near Syria's southern border when
he veered off and flew low toward northern Israel at 700-750 mph.
   SANA quoted the military spokesman as saying Adel's defection
``ended an espionage affair organized by the Israeli intelligence
service which had recruited this agent and used him to smuggle one
of our air force jets and deliver it to the enemy.''
   ``This abominable traitor and Israeli spy has stepped on all
sacred, national values when he sold his country and his people and
spied for the enemy ... He betrayed the honor and confidence of the
military,'' the spokesman added.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his talks
next month with Poland's Solidarity-led government will be a
``historic chance'' to mend fences with a World War II adversary.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl will offer Poland
relief for its $39 billion foreign debt during his Nov. 9-14 visit.
   Kohl's office also announced Friday that the chancellor will
visit Hungary soon, although no date has been set.
   West Germany has led efforts among European Community and
Western creditors to help Poland resolve its staggering economic
problems. The Bonn government has also been outspoken in its
support of democratic reforms instituted there and in Hungary.
   West Germany is Poland's biggest trading partner and its biggest
creditor, holding about 20 percent of Warsaw's foreign debt.
   ``We now have the historic chance, because of the dramatic
changes and improvements in Poland, for a new beginning in our
relations 50 years after World War II,'' Kohl told ARD television.
``We owe it to the younger generations to foster good
neighborliness and friendship.''
   Kohl's chief foreign affairs adviser, Horst Teltschik, and
Teltschik's Polish counterpart, Mieczyslaw Pszon, last week
concluded a package of financial and political accords that resolve
outstanding problems between the two countries, government
officials said.
   Klein said West Germany will tie its financial assistance to
specific projects. He confirmed the two governments have discussed
from $1 billion to $1.5 billion in aid.
   West Germany announced Monday that it had agreed to reschedule
$1.3 billion in Polish debt, and an earlier agreement effectively
wiped out about $523 million in loans to Poland.
   Among the accords are programs to improve living conditions for
ethnic Germans in Poland. The language and culture of the ethnic
minority have been discouraged in areas that were part of Germany
prior to World War II.
   West German officials concede privately that funds for
German-language schools and projects to increase production of
consumer goods are aimed partly at stemming the flow of ethnic
Germans from Poland. More than 140,000 ethnic Germans emigrated
from Poland to West Germany last year, and that number has already
been exceeded this year.
   Resolution of the economic and political issues cleared the way
for Kohl's trip, which initially was planned for the summer. It was
called off because of remaining differences between the two nations.
   Bonn had hoped to work out a reconciliation plan with Poland
before the 50th anniversary of the Sept. 1, 1939 invasion of Poland
by Nazi Germany, which set off World War II.
   Negotiations toward the West German-Polish summit were put on
hold during the spring talks between Poland's Solidarity trade
union and the Communist Party. Those negotiations Poland's freest
elections in more than four decades _which the opposition won by a
landslide _ and the Soviet bloc's first Cabinet not led by
Communists.
   Kohl will be the first Western leader to pay an official visit
to Poland since Tadeusz Mazowiecki was named premier in August.
   The talks had been frustrated by some prominent West German
politicians who said German territory lost to Poland after World
War II should be returned. National tensions still flare over the
40,000 square miles of German territory deeded to Poland after the
defeat of Nazi Germany.

   Municipal authorities in Hangzhou are asking

Saturday.
   To emphasize the point, the city Funeral and Internment

   Cremation is required in most places in China because of a

in Hangzhou, an eastern city of fewer than 2 million, even their
ashes are becoming bulky, the paper said.
   Most families leave them in urns at the city crematorium and
visit to pay respects at the annual Qing Ming festival.
   Several late Chinese leaders asked before death to have their
ashes scattered on mountains and rivers, and the paper quoted
Hangzhou Vice Mayor Wang Jizhong as saying that extending this to
everyone would be ``good for the country.''
   Authorities stressed the choice was up to the individual.
   The paper did not mention any possible harm to rivers. China has
a serious water pollution problem, with 80 percent of its rivers
polluted by raw sewage and untreated industrial waste.

<HEAD>Activist Says Fatal Car Crash was Accident, Not Foul Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Georgian activist Saturday dismissed speculation
that a car crash that killed a prominent Georgian dissident was
foul play and said it was an accident caused by a cow crossing the
road.
   Merab Kostava was riding with two other Georgian
pro-independence activists at 3 a.m. on a deserted, wet road Friday
when the car crashed. He died as a result of his injuries, an
announcement from the unofficial news agency Express-Khronika said.
   Kostava's companions, Tamara Chkeidze and Zurab Chavchavadze,
were injured.
   ``The car was moving at high speed and there was a cow crossing
the road,'' Gia Totkhadze, a spokesman for National Independence
Party's information agency, said in a telephone interview.
   ``When Chkheidze, who was driving, tried to avoid a collision,
they crashed into a car that was moving in the opposite
direction,'' he said.
   He said Ms. Chkheidze was recovering from her injuries but that
Chavchavadze's condition ``is hopeless.''
   On Friday, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, considered the dean of dissidents
in the southern Soviet republic, said Kostava's death coincided
suspiciously with threats made in the summer and last week.
   ``A week ago we were warned by one KGB man that we shall be
killed in the nearest future, Merab Kostava and I,'' Gamsakhurdia
said in a telephone interview from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
   He said he also received a warning last summer that all the
leaders of Georgian pro-independence movement would be killed by
Oct. 15.
   Nationalist fervor has run high in Georgia since spring, when 20
Georgians died in pro-independence unrest.
   Kostava was first arrested on political charges in 1956, a brief
obituary put out by Express-Khronika said.
   He was repeatedly sentenced to terms of several years in prison
camp and exile for political activities. ``Even in the camps he
continued his human rights work,'' the obituary said.
   He was released in the spring of 1987 during a widespread
amnesty that freed many Soviet political prisoners.
   Kostava was a member of the Georgian Helsinki Watch group and a
leader of the Holy Ilya Society, a religious-nationalist group that
has been prominent in the swelling agitation for Georgian
independence.
   He was believed to be 59 or 60 years old.

   Cast adrift by the Gorbachev revolution, many of
Western Europe's Communist parties are groping for ideological
stability, knowing they can no longer count on Moscow for guidance.
   The upheaval in the Soviet Union, the shift to democracy in
Hungary and Poland, and the flight of refugees from East Germany
have provoked responses from different parties ranging from
congratulations to embarrassment.
   With the Bolshevik bogy being replaced in Western minds by the
benign image of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, some Communists
believe they can win new hearts and minds and reverse their
electoral decline.
   Conversely, others fear that communism is losing its identity
and becoming a mere adjunct to Western-style socialism.
   ``What we're witnessing is the breakup of the old Communist
culture,'' said Martin Jacques, editor of the British journal
Marxism Today.
   ``Every Communist party is in flux as a result,'' Jacques said
in an interview. ``Some will survive, metamorphose.'' And those
that don't? ``There's a very good chance that the result will be
oblivion.''
   Communism in Western Europe has been in schism since the 1950s,
marked by periodic watersheds of what the Austrian Communist Ernst
Fischer once denounced as ``panzerkommunismus,'' or tank communism.
   The crushing of the 1956 Hungarian uprising; the Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia in 1968; the Soviet entry into Afghanistan in
December 1979 _ each of these events forced Communists to take a
clear stand for or against the Soviet line. The result often was a
party split.
   But with Gorbachev's openness to pluralism, there simply is no
longer a clear Soviet line.
   For doctrinaire parties, ``The Soviet Union was like their god.
So what happens when the pope, as it were, turns on them? Gorbachev
has clearly encouraged reforming forces within those parties, and
every hard-line party has been thrown into crisis to some degree or
other,'' Jacques said.
   The larger Communist parties have managed, in varying measure,
to adapt to the hectic pace set by Gorbachev. Those in Italy,
France and Spain can now claim they saw ``glasnost'' and
``perestroika'' coming, and prepared the ground with Eurocommunism,
a 1970s attempt to reconcile Communist orthodoxy with life in a
Western parliamentary democracy.
   For the West, Eurocommunism raised the specter of elected
Communists sitting at the Cabinet tables of NATO-aligned countries.
But that has happened only in France, from 1981 to 1984 under
President Francois Mitterrand, and for three months this year in
Greece.
   The Italian party, the largest in the West, actually supports
Italy's membership in NATO but has been barred from government
coalitions since 1947.
   Its vote has declined, from 34.4 percent in 1976 to 26.6 percent
in 1987, and it is seeking a more youthful image, even toying with
the idea of dumping ``Communist'' from its name. The French and
Portuguese parties have also seen their support slump.
   In Spain, the Communists have been trying since 1986 to shed
their hard-left image, joining forces with other left-wing parties
and no longer displaying the hammer-and-sickle flag at public
meetings.
   The Portuguese party now accepts the Western socialist concept
of a mixed economy. But in other areas it hews to doctrinaire
Marxism-Leninism.
   Last year it expelled reformist Zita Seabra for defending other
dissidents' right to criticize the party leadership.
   West Germany's tiny party is showing signs of strain over its
resistance to reforms. In May 1986, leader Herbert Mies won 95.2
percent of the vote at the party convention. Last January, he got
only 71.8 percent and admitted that the 20 percent decline in
membership during those three years resulted from the party often
reacting to events ``too late and inappropriately.''
   The British party, always marginal, has been further weakened by
a split into hard-liners and the free-thinking set whose views are
expressed by Jacques' ``Marxism Today.''
   Speaking for the hard-liners, John Haylett agrees that ``the
monolith is gone forever'' and that there are probably many Old
Guard Communists ``wandering around rudderless,'' thinking ``My
God! Everything that I believed in, everything I thought highly of,
now turns out to have feet of clay.''
   But he insists Communists can adapt, saying: ``Individual
Communist parties no longer look toward one single view. Each party
has to assess what it sees as the realities of a situation and make
a judgment.''
   Is that good or bad? Haylett believes it can broaden the
Communists' voter appeal because it is harder for communism's foes
``to play on the Russian Bear, the Communist bogy.''
   On the other hand, some worry that if communism is being spurned
by Poles and Hungarians, it is less likely to appeal to Western
voters.
   The clashing opinions are reflected in responses to what is
happening in Eastern Europe.
   The reformist parties have welcomed the democratic trend in
Poland and Hungary and bitterly criticized the East German
leadership.
   ``You cannot put your head in the sand,'' said the Swedish
party's vice president, Gudrun Schyman. Dutch Communist Party
leader Ina Brouwer said: ``Centrally organized socialism with a
one-party system is bankrupt _ that much is clear from events in
Eastern Europe.''
   The traditionalists are more inclined to defend the old order.
They insist Hungary has not really dumped communism, just
streamlined it; that Poland's problems stem not just from the
shortcomings of Communist centralization, but also from Poland's
financial debt to the capitalist powers; that the flight of
thousands of East Germans is a conspiracy by West Germany using the
lure of passports, jobs and homes.
   ``How would you feel if the government in France considered that
the citizens of Britain were actually the citizens of France and
could be given French passports just for the asking? You would
regard it as a hostile act and might consider that it indicates a
desire to occupy a part of Britain,'' said Tony Chater, editor of
The Morning Star, Britain's Communist daily.

<HEAD>Japanese Men Earn Twice As Much As Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average Japanese company employee earned
$27,000 last year, but the typical male earned more than twice as
much as his female counterpart, according to a government study
reported Saturday.
   The average annual income for Japan's 38 million company
employees, including bonuses, was up by $915, or 3.5 percent from
the previous year, the National Tax Agency said.
   The agency said the average female company employee earned
$15,800, less than half the average man's $33,100. The figures
include part-time employees who worked for the entire 12-month
period.
   Bonuses, given twice a year at most Japanese companies,
increased by 6.5 percent, the largest rise since 1979 when the
increase was 8.6 percent. The larger bonuses contributed greatly to
last year's income increase, the nationally circulated newspaper
Mainichi Shimbun quoted the agency as saying.
   The average net disposable income after adjustment for inflation
grew by 2.9 percent from a year earlier, helped mainly by the
larger bonuses and an income tax cut, the agency said.
   About 34 million, or 90 percent, of the company employees paid
income tax last year, the report said. It said the average worker
paid about $1,690.
   In comparison, the average self-employed person, other than
doctors and lawyers, paid only $1,440 in taxes, while farmers paid
an average of $1,010.

<HEAD>What Senators, Regulators Said About Lincoln Savings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-S&amp;L Victims, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from an April 10, 1987, memo written by
William Black, a savings and loan regulator in San Francisco, to
Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Black and other regulators met privately in Washington with five
U.S. senators who questioned the handling of Lincoln Savings, its
parent company American Continental Corp., and its chairman,
Charles Keating, who was a large contributor to the senators.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, responsible for
overseeing savings banks in California, Nevada and Arizona, wanted
to seize Lincoln in 1987. After Keating's complaints, supervision
was transferred to Washington. Regulators finally seized control of
Lincoln last April, after ACC filed for bankruptcy protection.

<TEXT>
   SEN. DENNIS DeCONCINI, D-Ariz.: We wanted to meet with you
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could
injure a constituent. ... They (Lincoln) have two major
disagreements with you. First, with regard to direct investment
(where the S&amp;L becomes a partner in a real estate venture). Second,
on your reappraisal. They're suing against your direct investment
regulation. ... We suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending. I know
something about the appraisal values of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. They appear to be grossly unfair. ... Lincoln is prepared to
reach a compromise value with you.
   SEN. ALAN CRANSTON, D-Calif.: (Arriving.) I'm sorry I can't join
you, but I have to be on the floor to deal with the bill. I just
want to say that I share the concerns of the other senators on this
subject. (Cranston leaves).
   SEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Ariz.: One of our jobs as elected officials
is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC is a big employer
and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special
favors for them. ... I don't want any part of our conversation to
be improper. ... I'd like to mention the appraisal issue. It seems
to me ... there's a problem. Arizona is the second fastest growing
state. Land values are skyrocketing. That has to be taken account
of in appraisals.
   SEN. JOHN GLENN, D-Ohio: ... Even the accounting firm says
you've taken an unusually adversary view toward Lincoln. To be
blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs. If things are
bad there, get to them. ...
   JAMES CIRONA, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco: This meeting is very unusual, to discuss a particular
company.
   DeCONCINI: It's very unusual for us to have a company that could
be put out of business by its regulators. ...
   RICHARD SANCHEZ, supervisory agent: Lincoln had underwriting
problems with all of their investments. ... The examiners looked at
52 real estate loans that Lincoln had made since the 1984 exam.
There were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan
files. ...
   CIRONA: These underwriting practices violate our regulatory
guidelines.
   BLACK: They are also an unsafe and unsound practice. ...
   SEN. DONALD RIEGLE, D-Mich.: Where's the smoking gun? Where are
the losses?
   DeCONCINI: What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up
their act?
   CIRONA: This is a ticking time bomb. ...
   RIEGLE: These people saved a failing thrift. ACC is reputed to
be highly competent.
   BLACK: Lincoln was not a failing thrift before ACC acquired it.
It met its net worth requirement. It had returned to profitability
before it was acquired. ...
   MICHAEL PATRIARCA, director of agency functions: I'm relatively
new to the savings and loan industry, but I've never seen any bank
or S&amp;L that's anything like this. This isn't even close. You can
ask any banker you know about these practices. They violate the law
and regulations and common sense.
   GLENN: What violates the law?
   PATRIARCA: Their direct investments violate the regulation. Then
there's the file stuffing. They took undated documents purporting
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes
more than a year after ...
   GLENN: Have you done anything about these violations of law?
   PATRIARCA: We're sending a criminal referral to the Department
of Justice. Not maybe, we're sending one. This is an
extraordinarily serious matter. ...
   DeCONCINI: The criminality surprises me. We're not interested in
discussing those issues. Our premise was that we had a viable
institution concerned that it was being over-regulated.

   The Vatican will hold an international
conference on AIDS next month, with participants including the
scientists who discovered the virus, officials said Saturday.
   The conference is scheduled for Nov. 13-15 and is being
organized by the Vatican's Council for Health Workers.
   Among those expected to attend are Robert Gallo of the United
States and Luc Montagner of France, credited with discovering the
AIDS virus.
   Pope John Paul II has called for compassion for AIDS victims but
opposes promotion of condoms to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Roman Catholic Church opposes artificial forms of birth control.
   The Vatican said last year it would hold a conference on AIDS,
or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. AIDS is caused by a virus
that attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of diseases.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact but also
can be spread through transfusions of blood or the sharing of
contaminated hypodermic needles.

<HEAD>Congress Juggles Books, Raises Fees to Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is pinning this year's hopes of
deficit reduction on a gimmick-filled package that speeds up
collections and puts off payments while raising some user fees and
specialized taxes.
   That package will not be in put in place quickly enough to avoid
across-the-board spending cuts in many spending programs on Monday.
But those arbitrary cuts can be rescinded once Congress agrees on a
plan to bring the 1990 deficit below $110 billion.
   The Senate approved its plan Friday night by an 87-7 vote after
stripping away hundreds of spending increases and targeted tax
cuts. The House plan was passed Oct. 5.
   President Bush severely limited deficit-reduction options when
he rejected any general tax increase. Congress restricted itself by
agreeing there would be no cuts in Social Security benefits.
   The lawmakers had a chance to make significant cuts when they
considered the 13 separate appropriations bills that pay for most
government activities, including defense, the courts, and Congress.
But they fell short. Their actions on appropriations will produce
little or no deficit savings; they could deepen the deficit by $6
billion or so.
   That left Congress to choose from minor tax increases and
reductions in spending that is not subject to annual
appropriations, such as Medicare, farm price supports and welfare.
The lawmakers ended up with a combination of one-time savings,
acceleration of tax collections, higher user fees and some tax
increases that will fall mainly on corporations.
   Some examples of the short-term savings:
   The plan passed by the House would delay for 16 days payment of
all claims from doctors and hospitals for treating Medicare
patients. Present law has a 14-day wait; the extra two days would
cut the 1990 deficit by $470 million.
   The Senate bill would cut the deficit by $111 million by
requiring that gasoline taxes be collected and handed over to the
treasury at an earlier stage in the distributon process.
   To generate an extra $800 million for deficit reduction in 1990,
the Senate bill would give large employers only one day to turn
over taxes they have withheld from workers' paychecks. They now
generally have three days.
   Then there is the capital-gains tax cut, the hottest issue in
Congress. Democrats were able to keep the issue off the Senate
bill, but the House bowed to Bush's urging and approved a cut. It
would produce $2.9 billion in budget saving in 1990, most of which
would amount to borrowing from capital-gains revenues that
otherwise would be expected in future years.
   Both houses voted to show a $1.77-billion deficit cut simply by
removing the Postal Service _ along with its own deficit _ from the
federal budget. Both claim another $568 million deficit reduction
by counting savings caused by repeal earlier this year of certain
tax benefits for savings and loan associations.
   The House agreed to require federal employees who retire in 1990
to wait an extra year for their lump-sum retirement annuity. The
deficit would drop by $700 million.
   The Senate plan would raise $50 million by allowing boat owners
to buy a decal entitling them to certain Coast Guard services.
Rental of airport slots at LaGuardia and Kennedy airports in New
York, O'Hare in Chicago and National in Washington would raise $239
million.
   The Senate voted to triple the maximum penalty that can be
imposed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and to raise
five times those imposed by the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration, cutting the deficit by $30 million and $65 million,
respectively.
   Denying that medical residents are students for purposes of
student loan deferments would raise $10 million under the Senate
bill.
   There are some real tax increases in one or both bills. For
example, both would repeal a special benefit for banks that lend to
employees who are buying stock in their employer's corporation.
Both would deny refunds of past-year taxes to companies claiming
large interest deductions from loans used in corporate-takeover
efforts.
   A handful of companies that manufacture chemicals deemed to
deplete the earth's ozone layer would be hit with a new tax. A
scheduled decline in the 8 percent airline ticket tax would be
delayed a year, to 1991, in the House bill and to next Oct. 1 in
the Senate bill.
   The proposed tax increase with an impact on the greatest number
of Americans, extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service
past a scheduled Dec. 31, 1990, expiration, was stripped from the
Senate bill. The House voted to make the tax permanent.

   Moslems and Hindus fought each other and
police in the central city of Indore during a Moslem festival
Saturday marking the birth of the prophet Mohammed, and at least 14
people were killed, news reports said.
   In Karachi, Pakistan, snipers opened fire on a religious parade
held in Mohammed's honor after some marchers shouted slogans
against the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran, police said.
   One person was killed and another eight were wounded, including
a Pakistani army officer, local authorities said.
   Tens of thousands of people were celebrating the birth in 570 of
Islam's prophet, Mohammed.
   Press Trust of India said mobs burned several houses, six fire
trucks and a shantytown in Indore, 410 miles south of New Delhi.
   United News of India said 14 people were killed and 100 injured,
including 11 policemen. Press Trust of India put the death toll at
15 and said 75 people were injured, at least 22 of them seriously.
   UNI said a curfew was imposed and that police were told to shoot
violators. It said arson was reported mainly from five areas of
Indore, a city of 830,000 people.
   Neither news agency said how the violence started or how the
casualties occurred, but both said violence started ``following a
religious procession,'' an apparent reference to a morning rally to
celebrate Id ul-Milad un-Nabi, which marks the 1419th anniversary
of Mohammed's birth.
   Communal clashes frequently erupt in India during Hindu and
Moslem festivals.
   Moslems make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
comprise 82 percent of the population.
   People marching and riding in brightly colored vehicles, buses,
bicycles and horse-drawn carriages paraded through the streets of
many Pakistani cities in observance of Mohammed's birth.
   The marchers in Karachi, Pakistan, belonged to the Sunni sect of
Islam, which represents the majority of Pakistan's 107 million
people. In Iran, the majority of people belong to the Shiite branch
of Islam.
   Witnesses said processionists screamed anti-Khomeini slogans as
they wound their way through the old quarter of the city, which is
dominated by Shiite Moslems.

<HEAD>Pilot Tracing Earhart Flight Says Hardest Part is Done</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA SMILEY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than two months of solo flying
accompanied by such perils as guerrilla missiles, Hurricane Hugo,
and equipment breakdowns, Gaby Kennard landed safely and said
Saturday it will be ``all downhill from here.''
   The 45-year-old Australian pilot is nearing the end of a
round-the-world trip retracing the 1937 flight of American aviator
Amelia Earhart, who vanished in the South Pacific on the final leg
of a record-setting global journey.
   Mrs. Kennard has flown 27,000 miles since she left Sydney on
Aug. 2. She has another 6,000 miles to go on a route that will take
her to Pakistan, India and Thailand before heading home.
   She landed in Bahrain on Friday the 13th.
   ``Getting to Bahrain was like a big hurdle,'' she said Saturday
in an interview. ``I feel like it's all downhill from here.''
   Mrs. Kennard was briefly feared missing after she left Cairo and
did not show up as expected in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. It turned out
she had stopped in Luxor, Egypt before flying directly across the
Saudi desert to Bahrain.
   Mrs. Kennard is piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga,
financed by a mortgage on her house in Sydney and other loans. Just
when funds were running low, she got a boost from a commercial
sponsor in Hawaii.
   Mrs. Kennard said she dreamed of flying since childhood, but the
inspiration for the global trip came when she learned about
Earhart, whose fate remains a mystery after 52 years.
   A mother of two, she has been a pilot for 10 years and is a
member of the ``Ninety-Nines,'' an international organization of
women pilots founded by Earhart.
   In retracing Earhart's flight, Mrs. Kennard flew from New Guinea
to Majuro. There, three local citizens told her their fathers and
other relatives claimed to have seen Earhart and her navigator,
Fred Noonan, after they made an emergency landing on Killi atoll
and were taken prisoner July 2, 1937, by the Japanese, who then
controlled the Marshall Islands.
   ``After talking to those people, I'm convinced that Amelia was
taken prisoner by the Japanese and died in captivity,'' she said.
``The Marshall islanders simply haven't any reason to lie.''
   Mrs. Kennard said her own trip has been so fraught with delays
and adventure that she sometimes feels as if ``Amelia is sitting on
my shoulder _ Amelia and a lot of other people.''
   She said the most frightening times have been night flights over
oceans. On the longest such leg, the 2,000 miles from Hawaii to
California, a faulty fuel switch caused her engine to cut
repeatedly.
   She fled Puerto Rico in haste to escape Hurricane Hugo, one of
the most devastating storms of recent years.
   ``Hugo and I passed each other going in opposite directions,
about 250 miles apart. I could see the clouds,'' she said. ``If I'd
stayed, it would have destroyed the plane.''
   On an 11-hour night hop from Natal, Brazil, to Dakar, Senegal,
she steered through four hours of violent thunderstorms using
lightning flashes as her guide _ ``When I saw one, I turned the
other way.''
   On the way from Dakar to Morocco, she was told to fly 20 miles
offshore to avoid guerrillas who have used anti-aircraft missiles
to shoot down at least two agricultural aircraft in recent months.
   But Mrs. Kennard said she changed her mind when she looked down
from 1,500 feet and saw ``a giant shark, at least a 20-footer''
below.
   ``I thought, `Oh, no. I'll take my chances with the guerrillas.
Anyway, this is not my day to get shot down.'''

<HEAD>Sickest, Oldest Among Hardest Hit if Catastrophic Repealed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some of the oldest and sickest of America's
elderly are among those who will be hardest hit if Congress scraps
or scales back Medicare coverage of catastrophic health care costs,
advocates for the elderly say.
   Many of these frail, aging Americans are in an economic tier of
the elderly population that is too poor to buy adequate private
supplementary health insurance but not poor enough to qualify for
Medicaid, analysts say.
   Congress is moving to repeal or cut back the year-old Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act in response to complaints from
higher-income seniors who felt they already had adequate private
coverage and would have paid too much of the program's costs
through an income tax surcharge.
   But defenders of the program maintain cutbacks would assuage an
affluent and vocal minority of senior citizens at the expense of
millions of lower-income Americans vulnerable to financial ruin
from high medical bills.
   Tricia Smith of the American Association of Retired Persons
describes those most vulnerable to the loss of catastrophic-care
benefits as ``poor frail old women.''
   Some better-off older Americans also may feel a pinch if
Congress rolls back the Medicare catastrophic coverage, experts say.
   Many retirees, for example, will see sizable increases in their
costs for private ``Medigap'' insurance as companies expand
policies to include expenses not covered by Medicare and raise
prices to keep up with the high inflation rate in health care.
   In addition, many private policies won't pick up prescription
drug costs and certain other benefits that are at risk of repeal.
   ``There will be a pure loss to people who have high drug
expenses, which are a substantial portion of the elderly,'' said
Joshua M. Wiener, health policy specialist at the Brookings
Institution, a liberal think tank.
   States, too, are likely to see their health costs rise, since
Congress is expected to preserve portions of the catastrophic
package that boost state Medicaid spending while it repeals
provisions that pared other Medicaid expenses.
   The government's catastrophic coverage package was designed to
provide senior citizens with protection against impoverishment from
high doctor, hospital and drug bills. It also offered new coverage
of other miscellaneous health care costs such as respite care and
mammograms.
   House-Senate bargaining over the future of the program is likely
to begin this week. The House has voted to repeal almost the entire
program and the Senate to preserve the hospitalization protections
and some smaller benefits while scrapping the new coverage for drug
and doctor fees.
   Edmund Haislmaier, health policy analyst at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, said that if the program is repealed, ``you're
going to have about 10 percent of the population near the poverty
level who will be at risk of being pushed down into poverty by the
risk of some serious illness.''
   Haislmaier said the Senate-passed plan is a workable compromise
that retains the most crucial benefits, expanded hospitalization
coverage and new Medicaid help for the poorest of the elderly.
   Advocates for the elderly, meanwhile, see each of the benefits
in the catastrophic package as important in its own right.
   For example, the prescription drug benefit, which would be
phased in over several years if it is preserved, would benefit 6
million people a year, many of whom spend more than $2,000 a year
on medications.
   The mammogram benefit, in 1990 offering payment for routine
testing every other year, is expected to save 4,000 lives a year if
it survives.
   The respite care benefit, which in 1990 would pay for limited
services by a home health aide, would offer relief to family and
friends burdened with the responsibility of daily care for an aged
loved one.
   Overall, the winners under a repeal or rollback of benefits are
retirees who can return to employer-sponsored health programs or
Medigap plans that provide good coverage at less cost than the
government program, Wiener said.
   The government's catastrophic plan was ``a terrible deal
financially'' for upper-income seniors, but for the majority of the
nation's 33 million Medicare recipients, ``the value of benefits
would have substantially exceeded what they would have paid,'' he
said.
   An estimated 70 percent of elderly Americans buy private
supplementary coverage of health insurance costs not covered by
Medicare and an additional 10 percent qualify for Medicaid. That
leaves about 20 percent who depend on Medicare and must absorb any
uncovered costs out of their own pockets.
   These people ``are often among the older and sicker in the
elderly population,'' said Diane Rowland, assistant professor of
health policy at Johns Hopkins University.
   Sixteen percent of the elderly have income between 100 percent
and 150 percent of the poverty line. Among that ``near-poor''
group, 27 percent have no health coverage other than Medicare. And
for the 65 percent who do buy private supplements, ``their premiums
are likely to be as much of a financial catastrophe as medical
expenses,'' Rowland said. The other 8 percent are covered by
Medicaid, for which eligibility levels vary from state to state.
   James Firman, president of the United Seniors Health
Cooperative, said that for those who do buy Medigap coverage,
premiums are likely to rise 30 percent to 40 percent next year.
   ``We are also very concerned that there's going to be a new wave
of abuses in the marketing and sale of Medigap policies,'' Firman
said. ``There's going to be a great deal of fear and confusion on
the part of older people.''
   Donald White, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America, which represents 350 of the nation's insurance
companies, said that while premiums are likely to rise, ``there
will not be any gaps in coverage and there is not going to be chaos
in the insurance market.''

   Here are highlights of the deficit-reduction
bill approved Saturday by the Senate, estimates of how five-year
revenue collections would be affected, and how it compares with a
bill passed by the House:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TAXES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   AIR SERVICE: Delay until next Oct. 1 scheduled reductions in the
8 percent tax on airline tickets and the 5 percent tax on air
freight. Raise $1.1 billion. House delayed reduction until Jan. 1,
1991.
   CRUISE SHIPS: Impose a $3-per-passenger tax on international
cruise and gambling ships. Raise $36 million. House voted a
$20-per-passenger tax. million.
   OIL SPILLS: Impose 3-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic crude oil and
imported oil and oil products, to help clean up spills. Raise $225
million. Same in House.
   CHEMICALS: Impose a gradually increasing tax on manufactuer's
sale or use of certain chemicals deemed to deplete the earth's
ozone layer. Raise $4.3 billion. Same in House.
   WITHHOLDING: Require withholding of income taxes from wages of
farm workers who already have Social Security taxes withheld. Raise
$404 million. Same in House.
   BANKS: Repeal tax break for interest earned on loans to permit
workers to buy stock in an employer's company through Employee
Stock Ownership Plans. Raise $8.9 billion. Same in House bill,
which would raise another $2.7 billion by repealing a deduction for
dividends paid on employer stock owned by an ESOP.
   PENSION FUNDS: Permit employers limited use of excess pension
funds to finance health benefits for retirees, thus reducing
tax-deductible use of the corporations' own money. Raise $711
million. House has similar.
   TAKEOVERS: Prohibit corporations from carrying back losses _ and
thus getting refunds of past taxes _ generated by borrowing to
finance takeover of another company. Raise $1.8 billion. Same in
House.
   
   The House bill has numerous tax provisions that are not in the
Senate plan. They include:
   TELEPHONES: Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and
long-distance telephone service, due to expire at the end of 1990.
Raise $10.4 billion.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Include deferred compensation, such as
contributions to 401(k) retirement plans, in the formula used for
determining amount of wages subject to Social Security tax and,
ultimately, monthly benefits. Raise $4.7 billion.
   FRINGE BENEFITS: Repeal requirement that employers prove their
tax-deductible contributions to employee health plans do not
discriminate against lower-paid workers. Lose $867 million.
   SELF-EMPLOYED: Extend through 1991 a law allowing self-employed
persons to deduct 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance.
Lose $806 million.
   EDUCATION: Restore for 1989, 1990 and 1991 authority for
employees to avoid tax on up to $5,250 worth of employer-provided
educational assistance per year. Lose $851 million.

used to help lower-income families buy their first home. Lose $668
million.
   LOW-INCOME HOUSING: Make permanent a credit that encourages
investment in building low-income rental housing for the poor. Lose
$3.6 billion.
   RESEARCH: Make permanent a credit for increased spending for
research, and extend for two years a rule governing how
corporations allocate such costs for tax purposes. Lose $5.6
billion.
   ACCOUNTING: Repeal the completed-contract accounting method,
which has allowed large builders and defense contractors to defer
taxes. Raise $967 million.
</TEXT>
<NOTE> SPENDING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE: The House bill repeals catastrophic
medical coverage for retirees and the taxes and premiums that
finance it. The Senate voted on separate legislation to repeal the
surtax and retain some benefits.
   HEALTH: Both bills would reduce the deficit by limiting Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. The House
plan includes a far-reaching overhaul of physician reimbursement,
ending payments on the basis of customary and reasonable fees and
substituting a formula that takes into account costs of a doctor's
training and equipment and the relative value of medical skills.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: The House bill would increase to $10,440 the
$8,880 limit on how much a person age 65 through 69 may earn
without losing any Social Security benefit. The Senate stripped
away its own provision raising the limit to $14,520.
   CHILD CARE: The House bill includes several provisions boosting
government aid for child care. Negotiators will choose from among
provisions increasing the earned-income tax credit for low-income
families with children under age 12; providing new direct subsidies
to states with regulations specifying mininum standards for
day-care centers; expanding the Head Start preschool program.
   The Senate deleted from its bill a plan allowing more
lower-income families to benefit from the existing child-care
credit, and creating two new tax credits to offset costs of health
insurance and to benefit families with children under age 4.

   A judge has rejected a 450-pound man's
argument that he should not have to face charges of sexually
assaulting a teen-age girl because the trial might kill him.
   James Charles Louden, 46, of Maple Shade asked a judge to
dismiss the indictment or declare his case indefinitely inactive.
He suffers from varius ailments, including high blood pressure and
diabetes, says his attorney Howard N. Sobel.
   ``All the doctors seem to say this guy is like a time bomb _
with that kind of weight and the stress,'' Sobel said Friday.
   ``They don't make these guys who are mentally incompetent stand
trial,'' he said. ``How about the physically incompetent?''
   ``This is the first time in my 40 years in law I've seen the
physical condition of a man raised as barring him from trial,''
Superior Court Judge Paul Kramer said Wednesday. He ordered Louden
to stand trial on Jan. 22.
   Sobel said he planned to meet with Louden to decide whether they
will appeal.

   In one of the dozens of scrapbooks kept by Bette
Davis, a picture portrays the young actress as the model of
gentility, wearing a long, white dress, holding a white parasol.
   Next to the photo is scrawled, ``For publicity _ what else?''
   The actress, who died this month at age 81, chronicled her
stardom with hundreds of articles, photos, annotated scripts,
letters and mementos. The collection, housed at Boston University,
reveals not only her career but her irreverent attitude toward
Hollywood glamour.
   ``The scrapbooks are just like her mind _ she was meticulous,''
said Howard Gotlieb, who as curator of the university library's
special collections persuaded Davis to donate the memorabilia more
than 15 years ago.
   The collection contains more than 100,000 items that range from
Davis' fourth-grade report card _ her best marks were in reading
and spelling _ to the transcript of her appearance on television's
``This Is Your Life.''
   There are photos of Davis with stars such as Clark Gable,
Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper, and copies of speeches she gave in
support of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the government's effort to
sell war bonds during World War II.
   One box contains a mirror that belonged to the legendary French
actress Sarah Bernhardt; it later became a gift to Davis from the
government of France.
   Another item in the collection is a Victorian-style factory time
clock that Davis detested as a teen-ager when she worked at a
factory in Lowell, where she was born. The time-keeping device
irked her so much that she tracked it down 60 years later and
donated it to the archive.
   Davis also kept a story about her life written by her mother,
Ruth Favor Davis.
   ``Bette Davis, Christianed Ruth Elizabeth Davis, was born on
April 5th, 1908. Nothing happened of importance to herald her
arrival,'' the story begins.
   But in a later passage, the elder Davis describes how her
daughter once was playing Santa Claus in school, and her costume
caught fire from candles on a Christmas tree. Her face was burned
and she had no eyebrows left.
   ``She told me later that for the next few moments she kept her
eyes closed saying to herself, `I'll make them think I'm blind,'''
her mother wrote. ``Even then she was reaching for the limelight,
even when she was in pain and even at the expense of the people who
loved her.''
   It was when Davis reached the limelight of Hollywood that her
career blossomed, and likewise her memorabilia starts to burst from
the scrapbooks, with articles filling every available inch on many
pages, and some clippings overlapping.
   One article, discussing the cost of hosiery in Hollywood, gained
entry into Davis' collection because it included a picture of her
legs _ and nothing else.
   Davis kept clips from her 1936 trip to Great Britain, after she
had become embroiled in a contract dispute with Warner Bros. The
articles range from those with big headlines, like ``Famous Film
Star in Blackpool,'' to a tiny one-sentence item saying she had
arrived in Liverpool.
   Gotlieb, who knew Davis for 26 years and has a portrait of her
in his office that was used in ``Jezebel,'' said the actress who
won an Academy Award for that film never tried to fake modesty.
   ``She knew she was extremely good,'' he said.
   Davis kept hundreds of congratulatory telegrams, even one in
1937 from a group in New York called Associated Cinema Fans of
Westchester Inc. The telegram reads: ``Delighted to inform you we
have unanimously voted you ideal choice Scarlett O'Hara.''
   Davis once told an interviewer she had the opportunity to play
the much-sought-after lead role in ``Gone With The Wind'' but
unknowingly gave up the chance amid her dispute with Warner Bros.
   Davis gained fame with dozens of other movies, and she kept
leather-bound scripts that have her name printed in gold.
   On the scripts are her notations. For example, in one of her
more famous roles as a flamboyant but fading Broadway star in ``All
About Eve,'' Davis scribbled several reminders to have a drink and,
of course, light a cigarette.
   The lighted cigarette was one of her trademarks. It appears not
only in Davis' script annotations, but also in many of her photos.
One picture shows her standing on a stone patio, cigarette in
mouth, striking a match.
   ``A favorite photograph!'' she wrote.

<HEAD>Administration Believes Noriega Being Isolated in Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, looking for hopeful
signs after the bungled coup attempt in Panama, is encouraged by
evidence of the growing repudiation in Latin America of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's rule.
   And administration officials are hoping to accelerate the
process at two major international parlays over the next month and
in other diplomatic encounters as well.
   At his news conference Friday, President Bush said he was
delighted by signs that Noriega has so little support elsewhere in
the hemisphere.
   Panama's membership in an eight-country hemispheric consultative
body has been suspended, and when the seven active members met this
past week in Peru, Noriega's government was roundly criticized.
   Still, there appears to be litte sentiment in the hemisphere for
U.S. military action against Noriega. In contrast to many members
of Congress, no hemispheric leader criticized Bush for not
providing Panama's rebel leaders with more military support on the
day of the coup attempt.
   Noriega seems to believe that diplomatic isolation counts for
little as long as he retains the support of Panama's Defense
Forces, but U.S. officials say the country's outcast role will
further erode his already questionable support within the military
establishment.
   The officials say all but two democratic countries in the
hemisphere _ Mexico and Ecuador _ have withdrawn their ambassadors
from Panama City.
   ``Those two embassies barely have contact with the Panamanian
government,'' one official said Friday, asking not to be identified.
   He said the most active embassies in Panama City appear to be
those of Cuba, Nicaragua and Libya.
   The Panama question is likely to be a major topic this week when
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez comes to Washington for
talks with Bush.
   Saying the time has come for Noriega to retire, Gonzalez last
week called for new elections followed by the appointment of a new
military commander by the elected president.
   As an inducement for Noriega to go along with Gonzalez's plan,
he would be allowed to retire in Panama, thus evading possible
extradition to the United States, where he faces drug smuggling
charges. So long as he remains in Panama, he cannot be extradited.
   The administration will give Gonzalez a hearing on his plan and
also hopes to press its case against Noriega at a summit meeting of
hemispheric democratic heads of government set for Oct. 27-28 in
Costa Rica.
   Bush and about 17 other heads of government are planning to
attend, but administration officials say it would be a mistake to
raise expectations that the summit will lead to dramatic action
against Noriega.
   Among Spanish speaking countries, the only presidents not
invited are from Cuba, Chile and Panama, none of which has an
elected government.
   Yet another opportunity for the administration to pressure
Noriega will occur in mid-November when foreign ministers of the
31-nation Organization of American States meet in Washington.
   The OAS held four special sessions on Panama between May and
August, but a team of OAS mediators was unable to fulfill its
mandate of achieving a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   The mediation effort was suspended several weeks ago, but a
revival of that initiative remains an option.
   Bush has not ruled out military force against Noriega,
suggesting Friday he would be willing to consider such a move so
long as it could be done with ``prudence.''
   But for the short term at least the administration appears
resigned to relying on other ways of bringing down the Panamanian
leader - all tedious and undramatic but relatively uncontroversial.
   Besides diplomatic pressure, the administration has had in place
for some time a series of economic sanctions against Panama.
Officials say a tightening of these measures has been under
consideration since well before the failed coup attempt of Oct. 3.
   One possibility is the withholding from the Panamanian
government of about $1.5 million in taxes U.S. government agencies
pay monthly on behalf of their Panamanian employees.

<HEAD>Pro-Choice Movement Targets Nine for Defeat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-choice activists today named Sen. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida and seven
other anti-abortion officials as special targets for defeat in next
year's elections.
   Emboldened by triumphs in Congress and the Florida legislature
last week, the National Abortion Rights Action League announced its
``NARAL Nine'' at its 20th anniversary conference. NARAL, which
counts 350,000 members, is the political arm of the pro-choice
movement.
   ``We intend to reward our political allies. But we also intend
to punish our enemies,'' said Kate Michelman, NARAL's executive
director. ``To elected officials, we say: If you remain out of step
on abortion rights, you will soon be out of a job.''
   Also addressing the conference, which drew hundreds of
pro-choice leaders from around the nation, was David Dinkins, the
Democratic candidate for mayor in New York City. ``I come to you
today ... to say that we in New York will always fight to protect a
woman's right to choose,'' he said.
   ``We're for it. Not half for it and half against it,'' he
declared.
   ``When I become mayjor New York City, people will respect the
law and obey the law or they will be arrested, prosectued and
punished,'' Dinkins said. ``That goes for street criminals, for
rapists, for corrupters, and for anyone who breaks the law to block
any woman exercising her right to choose.''
   Michelman said that ``the NARAL Nine _ and they're just the top
tier _ is where we're going to concentrate our response. This means
a heavy investment,'' in next year's elections.
   The target list includes Republican state legislators who have
been particularly vocal and effective in leading anti-abortion
efforts in key states, abortion opponents expected to seek higher
office, and two Democrats who have been identified as opposing
abortion rights.
   They are:
   _Stephen Freind, a Republican state representative in
Pennsylvania. NARAL said he is sponsiring a bill that would ban
abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy.
   _Helms, the three-term Republican senator from North Carolina
who has been an outspoken opponent of legalized abortions. So far,
only one Democrat, a little-known county prosecutor, has announced
as a candidate to oppose Helms.
   _Craig James, a Republican congressman from Florida who narrowly
defeated a veteran Democrat in 1988. NARAL had already targeted him
in advertising.
   _Martinez, the Florida governor whose state legislature rejected
all his proposals for restricting abortion in a special session he
convened last week. His likely opponents include Democratic Rep.
Bill Nelson, who NARAL said has a record of opposing abortion
rights.
   _Tom Miller, Iowa's Democratic attorney general and candidate
for governor in 1990. Miller is described as a staunch
anti-abortion advocate who faces several pro-choice opponents in
the Democratic primary.
   _William O'Neill, Democratic governor of Connecticut, who faces
several likely opponents.
   _Kurt Pringle, Republican state representative in California,
who won his first term narrowly in 1988. He is from Orange County.
NARAL said California's legislative elections would be a special
target because anti-abortion forces have a narrow majority in the
state assembly.
   _Denny Smith, Republican congressman from Oregon, who won
narrowly in 1988.
   _Tom Tauke, Republican congressman from Iowa, who is an
anti-abortion candidate for the Senate in 1990, opposing Democratic
Sen. Tom Harkin's bid for a second term.
   The group is also involved in the 1989 races for governor in New
Jersey and Virginia, and on Thursday began airing ads on Virginia
television stations attacking anti-abortion Republican candidate
Marshall Coleman. It was also running ads in more than a dozen
Sunday newspapers.
   Michelman said the group plans to work in 1990 party primary
campaigns in an effort to defeat anti-abortion candidates.
   In Iowa, the group plans to run an independent expenditure
campaign against Miller. In Florida, Michelman said the group would
reassess its involvement in the governor's race if Nelson becomes
the Democratic nominee and he does not embrace a pro-choice
position.
   Dinkins paid tribute ``to the women and men of the Florida state
legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives for their actions
... to protect reproductive choice for all of America's women.''
   While the Florida legislature rebuffed Martinez, the House voted
216-206 to broaden the circumstances under which poor women may
obtain a federally financed abortion _ now allowed only if the
woman's life is in danger. The new measure would permit
taxpayer-paid abortions in cases of rape and incest as well.
   Dinkins also took note of the Supreme Court's ruling earlier
this year in a Missouri case, in which the high court gave the
states broader authority to regulate abortions.
   ``With the Webster decision, we learned that the Supreme Court
can be packed ... and rights once recognized must constantly be
renewed and defended in the political arena,'' Dinkins said.
   ``The nation's highest court is sending the struggle for
reproductive rights back to the grassroots _ to the governors'
mansions, state legislatures, city halls, neighborhoods, precincts
and streets of every city, town and village in the nation,'' he
said.

   Former professional wrestler Antonio Inoki was
attacked by a knife-wielding man Saturday while giving a speech
inside an auditorium in northern Japan, police said.
   Inoki, a member of Parliament best known in the United States
for his exhibition bout with boxer Muhammad Ali 13 years ago, was
hospitalized with a head injury that will require three weeks of
treatment, police in Fukushima said.
   They said the alleged assailant, a 39-year-old man, was subdued
by security officials at the Fukuoka Prefectural Aizu Gymnasium and
turned over to police.
   The attacker, armed with an 8-inch-long knife, ran onto the
stage of the gym while Inoki, an independent member of the House of
Councilors, was addressing about 2,000 people, police said.
   Inoki, 46, a guest speaker at a rock concert, was talking about
international exchanges through sports, they said.
   Inoki wrestled several times in the gym before winning election
to Parliament in July.
   No further details of the attack were immediately available.
   Inoki fought Ali in Japan in a widely ridiculed but inconclusive
match that purported to match the American boxing great with
Japan's finest wrestler.

   Soviet legislators, tasting real power for the
first time in the history of the communist state, are trooping to
Capitol Hill looking for ways to make the Supreme Soviet operate
more like the U.S. Congress.
   ``I've asked for a copy of this law, and I'm going to have it
translated into Russian and take it home for a model,'' a visibly
moved Ilya Zaslavsky told reporters in a room just off the Senate
floor during the roll-call vote passing legislation on civil rights
for the handicapped.
   Zaslavsky, 29, who lost both legs due to medical malpractice in
his childhood, was the guest of Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas, whose right arm was crippled during World War II.
   After a sweeping victory last March in the voting district of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Zaslavsky has emerged as a
champion of the handicapped and one of the most articulate
reformers in the Soviet parliament.
   Five Soviet legislators who made the pilgrimage to Capitol Hill
over the past month told The Associated Press they were impressed
by the power of congressional committees and size of congressional
staffs.
   ``I'm very jealous,'' said Volodymyr Yavorivsky, a legislator
from the Soviet Ukraine who visited the Capitol on Tuesday.
   A Soviet lawmaker is lucky to have a staff of two, compared with
14 for a member of the U.S. House and 34 for the average Senator.
   Yavorivsky, who was raised ``with a hatred of capitalist
society,'' said that since arriving in the United States last week,
he has been deeply impressed by American tolerance for divergent
views.
   And Americans traveling to the Soviet Union recently have been
astounded by newfound tolerance there.
   Two U.S. congressional delegations traveled to Moscow this
summer spreading the gospel of American democracy, and several
members found Soviet parliamentarians eager to receive copies of
U.S. laws. Rep. Dave Dreier, R-Cal., left Moscow impressed with
Russian sincerity in studying Congress.
   ``This is not the KGB,'' said Dreier. ``These are people who
want information on the way Congress does business.''
   The Soviet parliament, known as the Supreme Soviet ``has been
used to second-class status,'' said Dreier. ``They do not yet know
the power they have.'' But they are eager to learn.
   In the past, the Supreme Soviet rubber stamped decisions made by
the ruling Communist Party Politburo.
   Since semi-free elections last March, Soviet lawmakers have
challenged the authority of the government, turning down a dozen
cabinet nominees, grilling the heads of the military and secret
police, and last week rejecting as unconstitutional a proposal by
Gorbachev to ban strikes for 15 months.
   ``I have come to the United States with newly opened eyes,''
said Yavorivsky. ``For 70 years, the authorities have pounded into
the Ukraine a hatred of capitalist society, which we were told was
rotting away.''
   ``We were wondering when we would smell the stench of rot,'' he
said. ``Instead, we smell sausage, ham and meat,'' commodities that
have all but disappeared from stores throughout the Soviet Union.
   In his home district of Kiev, still crowded with refugees from
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster, Yavorivsky has turned
part of his three-room apartment into an office, and enlisted his
wife and daughter as helpers without pay to work on constituent
problems.
   Like other Soviet lawmakers, Yavorivsky is a man with a mission,
working on a parliamentary committee to block pollution in the
Ukraine, the second largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Yavorivsky belongs to the 2,250-member Congress of Peoples'
Deputies that was elected in March and selected from its ranks the
542-member Supreme Soviet, the sitting legislature.
   Konstantin D. Lubenchenko, a Moscow State University law
professor elected to the Supreme Soviet, said his mission is among
``the first generation of Soviet congressmen who ... are attempting
to build a legal-based government, a government based on the rule
of law.''
   ``You should think about us as bricklayers who are building a
house without having a good blueprint ... In order to construct a
blueprint for this house, we have come to the United States to
study,'' said Lubenchenko.
   Soviet lawmakers, he said, are especially interested in learning
how Congress ``asserts control over the executive organ of power.''
   Before Gorbachev's reforms, ``the real power lay in the hands of
party apparatchiks,'' said Lubenchenko.
   For Lubenchenko, chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional
legislation and reform, one of the most startling discoveries was
the size of congressional staffs, 15,000.
   Staff size involves more than prestige in an age where
information can equal power, and in a system where the government
has withheld key facts.
   In theory, each of the 542 Soviet deputies is entitled to 300
rubles ($480) a month for staff, but that barely covers the salary
of a secretary plus an assistant who is expert in the lawmaker's
area of speciality, said Lubenchenko.
   Soviet deputies have been promised office space in Moscow, he
said, but now they must settle for a room in the Hotel Moskva, near
the Kremlin.
   ``We have so little technical support that I had to get my son
to try to rig a computer to help us out,'' Lubenchenko said,
laughing. ``His payment isn't bad, though. I'll give him a few
pairs of bluejeans from this trip.''

   Satellite-gathered data on weather, crops and
environmental damage will be crucial in avoiding world famine in
the 21st century, an Ohio congressman said Saturday in urging
support for U.S. Earth-observation programs.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said satellites ``are basic tools for
humanity in the search for solutions to hunger.'' But, according to
a report he released on existing and future remote sensing
capacities of Earth satellites, funding for the primary U.S.
satellite program, Landsat, is uncertain at best.
   Hall said the study, ``Satellite Technology and World Food
Security,'' ``provides clear evidence that any loss of our
satellite capability will directly affect our ability to avert
famine.
   ``This report makes clear the crucial role of the U.S. satellite
Landsat in monitoring food production. The food security community
has not spoken loudly enough in support of Landsat as Congress
debated its precarious future.''
   Hall, who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger,
issued the Congressional Research Service study in conjunction with
World Food Day, which takes place Monday. The study had been
requested by Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, the committee's former
chairman who died in a plane crash in Africa.
   The study said the world's population could nearly triple to 14
billion in the next century. And with satellites playing a
front-line role in helping predict weather, crop failure and
eventual famine, the United States must decide whether it will
continue building and operating satellites such as Landsat or rely
more heavily on foreign data, the report said.
   To monitor agricultural and environmental conditions, the United
States primarily uses data from civilian polar orbiting satellites
and from the Landsat program, which has two aging satellites in
orbit and a replacement under construction.
   United Nations world food groups use data from U.S., European
Space Agency, French, Japanese and the Soviet satellites.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans a
Mission to Planet Earth program in the 1990s that will use
satellites to study the Earth's natural systems. But the plan could
cost $15 billion to $30 billion over a 20-year period, and no
budget is yet available, the report said.
   Hall said the NASA plan ``must also include activities that will
increase understanding of Earth's capacity to produce sufficient
food.''
   The government in 1985 turned over to a private company, Eosat,
operation of Landsat 4 and 5. Eosat also received a $250 million
subsidy and was to build two more satellites.
   But Congress and the White House debated funding for the
following three years and the Commerce Department announced earlier
it had no money to operate the satellites.
   The satellites were given a reprieve in June when President Bush
said he would approve new funds for Landsats 4, 5 and 6. However,
the source of that funding is unclear as Congress works on a
deficit-reduction package for fiscal 1989.
   A July 1991 launch is planned for Landsat 6. But Landsats 4 and
5, which have been operating beyond their expected lifetimes, could
cease operation before that time, the report said.

   The Communist Party daily on
Saturday served notice that the government will not allow
demonstrations by independent groups to mark the anniversary of the
founding of Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28.
   The newspaper Rude Pravo said ``several'' Czechoslovak dissident
groups hoped to demonstrate that day to mark 71 years of
Czechoslovak independence.
   Last year on the anniversary, riot police using water cannons
and tear gas dispersed a crowd of about 5,000 demanding more
freedom at home.
   ``Several illegal groups want to misuse the oncoming state
anniversary for confrontation with our state power,'' Rude Pravo
said.
   ``Nobody, at home or abroad, can expect us to vacate our
positions for anti-socialist forces (and) let the party lose its
influence on the course of events,'' it added.
   In a separate article, the newspaper blasted West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for a speech Oct. 10 at the opening of the
Book Fair in Frankfurt in which he said the ``winds of freedom will
blow'' one day in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Poland has, in a very encouraging way, stepped forward on a
path of bigger freedom and more human rights and Hungary is about
to follow,'' Kohl said, referring to recent democratic reforms in
those Soviet bloc nations.
   ``That's why it is more than a mere dream that one day even in
Czechoslovakia and elsewhere the wind of freedom will blow,'' Kohl
said. He also urged Czechoslovak authorities to grant dissident
Vaclav Havel an exit visa so he could come to the fair to receive
its top prize.
   Havel has not received permission to travel to Frankfurt.
   ``It's hard to believe that at a time when East-West relations
are improving, Bonn comes with a strange concept of building a
common European Home,'' Rude Pravo said, accusing Kohl of acting
``as a teacher of nations'' and interfering in Czechoslovakia's
internal affairs.
   Although it enjoys one of the highest standards of living among
the seven Warsaw Pact nations, Czechoslovakia has taken one of the
hardest lines against dissent and has been reluctant to emulate
political and economic reforms under way in the Soviet bloc.

   Hundreds of workers fled oil rigs in the Gulf
of Mexico as Tropical Storm Jerry inched toward the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.
   A hurricane watch was issued this morning for the coast from
Port Arthur, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River, with
landfall somewhere along that area forecast for Sunday at the
earliest.
   The storm weakened slightly this morning and also was found to
be farther away from land than first thought and moving more
slowly, said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the
Mexican coast and by early today had maximum sustained winds of 70
mph. By late morning, though, the winds had eased to 65 mph.
   Forecasters said conditions were not favorable for a major
increase in storm strength, but noted that even a relatively slight
increase could bring the storm up to hurricane strength, defined as
74 mph or more.
   Evacuations from the oil rigs began early Friday, soon after
Jerry reached tropical storm strength in the southwestern gulf,
stirring up rough seas. Officials said more than 4,000 workers
would be brought to shore if the rigs were all shut down.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' Shell Oil
spokeswoman Wendy Jacobs said. ``Everyone knows you don't take any
chances with these.''
   At noon EDT today, Jerry's center was near 24.9 north latitude
and 93.1 west longitude, about 400 miles south southwest of New
Orleans. The storm was moving north at 6 mph, more slowly than
forecasters thought earlier in the day.
   The system's rough seas could coincide with unusually high tides
expected all week because of an unusual alignment of the Earth, Sun
and Moon.
   Tides through Friday were expected to peak at their highest
levels in a decade, Clark said, perhaps a foot above their usual
highs in the gulf.
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.
The storm, which killed 33 in the Caribbean and 29 on the mainland
United States, hit Charleston, S.C., late Sept. 21.
   Storm preparations were under way along the gulf coast.
   On Grand Island, La., in the gulf south of New Orleans,
officials readied evacuation plans for 2,000 residents.
   ``We just have to play it hour-by-hour and see what happens, but
when there's a storm in the Gulf it kind of raises everybody's
hackles a bit,'' said Pete Picou, civil defense director of Cameron
Parish on the southwestern Louisiana coast. ``Down here you can't
ever take them for granted.''

<HEAD>Political Dynamics of Abortion Changing in Congress and Across the
Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Rep. John Rowland did an about-face
on the abortion issue a week before his planned announcement as a
candidate for Connecticut governor _ and offered ``I don't know''
when asked why he changed positions.
   Democrat Rep. W.G. Hefner also shifted and voted to soften the
ban on Medicaid-financed abortions. He reasoned that he previously
had been a target of abortion foes in his North Carolina district,
but that the political climate was starting to change.
   Other congressmen gave other reasons: Their wives had pressured
them, or they really meant to vote this way last time.
   But by any analysis, the changes in position by 27 members of
Congress on the issue of tax-financed abortions reflect a change in
the political dynamics of abortion.
   Republican Rep. Henry Hyde, whose name has been linked with the
Medicaid abortion restrictions known as the ``Hyde amendment'' for
a decade, put his finger on what had happened.
   ``They're perceiving their constituencies as pro-choice,'' he
said.
   Last week's events in Congress, in Florida's legislature, and in
the states holding elections this year, showed that the new
politics of abortion could have broadening implications.
   Republican strategists are clearly concerned about polls
suggesting voters are increasingly inclined to support continuing
legal abortions and to oppose candidates who want to limit those
rights. The Republican Party since Ronald Reagan's nomination in
1980 has had a strongly anti-abortion platform.
   ``This causes Republicans in general nervousness,'' said one
national Republican strategist. ``Abortion as an issue ...
definitely has changed for candidates at the governor and state
legislature level.'' Citing the sensitivity of the issue, the
strategist spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   While the depth of change remains subject to debate, all sides
called it a reaction to the Supreme Court's ruling last summer in
the Webster case. By giving states broader authority to regulate
abortions, the court made abortion _ and the prospect that abortion
rights could be taken away _ a more relevant issue in the states
and mobilized pro-choice groups.
   ``Clearly the pro-choice movement has outmaneuvered the pro-life
movement since `Webster,''' said Eddie Mahe, a Republican political
consultant.
   Emboldened by their successes, some Democrats have even begun to
think abortion may be that sought-after ``wedge'' issue _ an
emotion-packed weapon that could divide Republicans and draw back
to the Democratic Party young voters, aged 18 to 30, who began
drifting to Reagan and the Republicans a decade ago.
   The wedge, they hope, could be used to separate ideologically
conservative Republicans from those younger voters who were drawn
to the GOP on economic issues _ but who have never held the
conservative views on social issues that the ideological
conservatives and evangelical Republicans have.
   ``In 1980, a trend began that was a very serious threat to
Democrats _ losing younger voters,'' said Frank Greer, a Democratic
political consultant who has produced a groundbreaking appeal to
conservatives based on the abortion issue in Virginia.
   ``All of a sudden, young voters have awoken to the fact
Republicans are out of touch with their social concerns,'' Greer
said. ``I think it's a watershed political event, and you're seeing
it in Virginia.''
   Republicans dispute that view, and say the abortion issue is
still developing.
   ``One assumes the pro-life people will get their act together,''
said Mahe, a consultant to the Republican National Committee in
last year's presidential race. ``They will attempt to frame the
issue in ways that benefit them. Then we'll see. This is still
unknown.''
   But the change has been felt in Congress and the states already.
   One result is that abortion opponents no longer instill the same
fear they once did among members of Congress who had seen
pro-choice candidates such as former Sen. Dick Clark of Iowa lose
in 1978 in defeats laid to the abortion issue.
   ``In the past, the only people we heard from were people who say
in no circumstances should abortion be performed,'' said Hefner,
who contended his switch on the issue merely returned his position
to the way he had voted in years past. ``Other people, who
represent what I think is a more reasonable position, are being
heard from more.''
   The House's narrow 216-206 vote was to broaden the circumstances
under which poor women may obtain a federally financed abortion to
include rape and incest, as well as the existing provision for
cases where the mother's life is in danger.
   In Florida's legislature, the anti-abortion Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez suffered total defeat in the special session he convened
to impose new restrictions on abortion.
   And in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, abortion emerged
as a powerful issue in the hands of Democratic candidates for
governor who support continuing legal abortions.
   In Virginia, the example is striking. Democrat Douglas Wilder
has moved into a lead, according to independent polls, after three
weeks of airing television advertising that attacks his Republican
opponent as trying to take away a woman's right to an abortion.
   In a conservative state that was once capital of the
Confederacy, Wilder's ads are crafted to appeal to conservatives,
arguing that his opponent would take away rights and allow
government intrusion in personal affairs.
   Wilder, incidentally, is seeking to become the first black
elected governor of a state.
   ``If anyone had bet me that a black man would be running for
governor of Virginia, and winning, using abortion as an issue, I
probably would have lost every nickel I had,'' mused liberal
pollster Harrison Hickman.

<HEAD>Leadership Can Overcome US-Japanese Friction, Solarz Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. leaders must work to curb
the growing criticism coming from opposite sides of the Pacific,
says a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``I am concerned about the tone of the relationship and the
extent to which more and more it has become subject of criticism in
Congress and outside, with comparable echoes in Japan,'' Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. told a gathering Friday of the Washington
Foreign Correspondents Association.
   ``We need leadership to make clear that while the relationship
is not without differences and difficulties, it is of enormous
benefit,'' said Solarz.
   He is one of the most influential Democrats engaged in foreign
affairs. Fellow party members are among Washington's staunchest
critics of Japanese trade policies.
   Solarz commented on a recent U.S. opinion poll showing that the
loss of American jobs to imports, the multibillion dollar trade
deficit with Japan and heavy Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate and industry have prompted many Americans to regard Japan as
posing a greater threat to their future than that posed by the
Soviet Union under President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Americans ``are the victims of our own success,'' Solarz said.
``We helped build the Japanese economy from the ashes of war. We
benefit greatly from their economic progress, we ought to find ways
to continue to benefit. Japan is certainly not a threat to the
United States.''
   He also acknowledged that the threat of war with the Soviet
Union is declining, thanks to Gorbachev's policies of restructuring
and openness. Solarz, who chairs the House Asia-Pacific
subcommittee, closely follows Europe because he represents a
Brooklyn, N.Y., district with people of mainly European ancestry,
including many recent immigrants.
   Asked if the United States should advocate independence for the
Baltic Soviet Republics in the western part of the U.S.S.R., even
if meant Gorbachev's ouster, Solarz said it was a mistake to link
U.S. policy ``with the survival of a particular political leader.''
   ``If Gorbachev were forced to resign it would be a source of
dismay, given the possibilities of his policies, but ... hopefully
a new leadership would be committed to the same policy,'' he said.

   Police bolstered security at U.S.
government facilities Saturday as the nation's main dissident
alliance demanded the recall of the U.S. ambassador and defended an
attack on his residence.
   Leaders of Chonminyon, an alliance of dissident groups, said at
a news conference that the attack ``reflected the will of the
people.'' The group earlier issued a statement demanding an end to
ties with the United States.
   Six radical students stormed U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg's
house early Friday and went on a half-hour rampage, hurling tear
gas and breaking objects with iron bars before police seized them.
   Gregg and his wife escaped unharmed.
   Police said security had been tightened at all U.S. government
facilities since the attack.
   Embassy officials said they would review the security system of
Gregg's residence in downtown Seoul. Unlike the U.S. Embassy, it is
not guarded by U.S. Marines but by South Korean police.
   In addition to the attack on the Greggs' home, police reported
anti-U.S. protests on 26 campuses in seven cities Friday.
   On Saturday, about 400 radical students chanting ``Yankee go
home!'' hurled firebombs and rocks when police blocked an anti-U.S.
march out of Sogang University.
   In its statement, Chonminyon demanded the United States recall
Gregg, contending he supported military rule when he served as CIA
station chief in Seoul in the 1970s.
   ``We ask you to immediately recall Gregg to return South
Korean-U.S. relations to normal,'' the statement said.
   The dissident alliance also called for the withdrawal of the
43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea and an end to U.S. demands
for greater access to South Korean markets.
   ``The presence of U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula serves as
an obstacle to peace in the region,'' the group said.
   Dissidents and radical students have called for Gregg's recall
and an end to U.S. trade pressure. The United States wants Seoul to
end import barriers to help correct its trade surplus with
Washington.
   The radicals also have demanded President Roh Tae-woo cancel his
trip Sunday to Washington for talks with President Bush, charging
Roh is seeking to improve U.S. ties to bolster his conservative
government.
   The radicals are a small but vocal minority.
   Most South Koreans support Seoul's alliance with Washington and
the presence of U.S. troops here.

seems unlikely as this country's civil war enters its second decade.
   The meeting is set for San Jose, Costa Rica, but violence has
surged in advance of the talks and each side has accused the other
of ill will, though neither wants to be seen as the ``bad guy'' who
breaks up the talks.
   The rightist administration of President Alfredo Cristiani wants
the Oct. 16-17 session to produce an immediate cessation of
hostilities. Cristiani says that will be virtually the sole subject
of discussion, with other matters, such as possible political or
economic changes, left for later.
   The insurgents reject the immediate cease-fire proposal, saying
it would be suicide to stop fighting before negotiating terms under
which the war should end.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the 10-year-old
war between the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, or FMLN, and a succession of U.S.-backed governments. An
Oct. 15, 1979 coup by young military officers is regarded as the
start of the conflict.
   The rebels are fighting to abolish what they contend is an
oligarchic system that has enriched a tiny minority of this
nation's 5 million people while leaving the majority impoverished.
   The rebels and the government met in Mexico City last month in
an atmosphere characterized as cordial and constructive, although
the only substantive agreement was to meet monthly in the future.
   The Mexico City meeting was the first between the guerrillas and
a Salvadoran government since 1987 and followed Aug. 7 accords
calling for peace talks signed by Cristiani and other Central
American presidents. Cristiani also called for talks when he took
office June 1.
   The guerrilla's terms for a cease-fire include: beginning a
reform of the conservative-controlled judiciary; a halt to
repression by security forces; trials for death squad members;
overhaul of the 1983 constitution; and legislative elections
earlier than their scheduled date of 1991.
   The rebels also want guarantees their forces will not be
attacked or harassed by the numerically superior and
better-equipped government army prior to eventual demobilization.
   But it is doubtful the government will discuss any of these
things this week.
   ``We do not intend to negotiate a political platform with the
FMLN,'' Cristiani said recently. ``That is what the FMLN _ once it
is part of the democratic process _ will have to negotiate with the
Salvadoran people if it hopes to obtain political power.''
   The insurgents say the government's insistence that they simply
lay down their arms and ``join the democratic process'' is
tantamount to a call for their surrender.
   ``That is absurd,'' said Ferman Cienfuegos, one of the five
guerrilla commanders, in an interview in Nicaragua. ``Surrender
would be political suicide.''
   ``The government has adopted a position as if we had been
defeated, when it is obvious we have not been defeated,'' said
Leonel Gonzalez, another commander.
   An estimated 7,000 full-time revolutionary combatants and about
twice that many militia fighters control a swath of northern and
eastern El Salvador and mount attacks in all 14 provinces.
   Cristiani denies he is demanding surrender, but Ricardo
Valdivieso, vice minister for foreign affairs, told journalists
last week the government would insist on demobilization of the
insurgent army.
   A high-ranking army officer, commander of a garrison in one of
the hottest war zones, was asked if acceptance of an immediate
cease-fire would harm the guerrillas.
   ``Of course it would,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``With a cessation of hostilities, we move in the
battalions to receive their weapons, take down their names and send
them to their homes.''

   Conservatives were glad to read that abortion
reportedly is one of the issues being used by the White House to
screen candidates for the job of director of the National
Institutes of Health.
   But a member of the search committee that recommended potential
candidates said she hoped the volatile issue would not ``preclude
our getting the very best scientific leadership'' for NIH.
   One of the candidates for the job, Washington University
Chancellor William Danforth, brother of Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
was asked for his views recently in a call from the white House
personnel office, according to an Oct. 6 report in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Science quoted an unidentified colleague as saying Danforth was
asked what his views were on abortion and on fetal-tissue research.
The magazine quoted the source as saying Danforth told the caller:
``If that is all you want to know, I'm not your man.''
   The magazine said Danforth declined to comment on the
conversation, but said the NIH job was ``not my thing'' and that he
was ``wedded'' to the St. Louis university.
   The search committee that recommended names of potential
candidates did not assess abortion views during the process, said
Virginia Weldon, a member of the panel and vice president for
scientific affairs at Monsanto Co. in St. Louis. ``We didn't
discuss that,'' she said.
   She said she was not surprised the White House would ask about
abortion views ``since it's a major issue in our country today.''
However, she added, ``I think it would be very unfortunate if that
issue precluded our getting the very best scientific leadership for
the National Institutes of Health.''
   Asked Friday about the Since report, Gary Bauer, president of
the conservative Family Research Council and a former domestic
policy aide in the Reagan White House, said he ``would expect the
White House to be asking those questions.''
   Conservatives have said fetal-tissue research is an issue they
will be watching closely and one that could erupt into a firestorm.
NIH currently has a moratorium on using fetuses from elective
abortions in federally funded research. An NIH advisory committee
last year concluded that using fetal tissue for research is
acceptable, but Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
has not acted on the panel's report.

<HEAD>Nobel-Awarding Swedish Academy Shaken by Rift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never in its tradition-bound 203 years
has the Swedish Academy, an august body of professors, authors and
literary critics, been in such a muddle _ and just before it is to
award the Nobel Prize in literature.
   Angered by its response to the Salman Rushdie affair, three of
its 18 members have handed in resignation letters. But chosen for
life, they cannot quit. They must remain until they die.
   Members claim the rift has not hampered the work of choosing
this year's Nobel laureate, who is to be announced this month.
   But it has exposed tensions inside this elite body and tainted
its image.
   Historically, internal fighting was been kept within the
Academy's 18th-century walls. A member's only form of protest has
been to quietly boycott the weekly meetings.
   Writer Kerstin Ekman, 56, one of the three rebels, has openly
demanded change, saying ``new and fresh forces are needed'' in the
Academy.
   ``We would have dug the Academy's grave, had we let the three
go,'' responded Goran Malmkvist, a professor who joined the Academy
in 1985. ``Who would have agreed to replace them? No one.''
   The work of the prestigious body always has been shrouded in
tradition and rituals that gave it an air of untouchable noblesse.
   That came to an end in March, after Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla
Khomeini pronounced a death sentence against British author Salman
Rushdie for his book ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
found offensive.
   The sentence aroused the fury of literary figures and
governments around the world.
   But the Academy, after long discussion, issued a brief and
carefully phrased statement defending free expression but without
explicitly supporting Rushdie.
   ``It should be self-evident to everyone that the Swedish Academy
firmly repudiates every effort to strangle free speech,'' the
statement said.
   Further comment would violate the Academy's code against
political involvement, Academy officials said.
   One reason for its deliberate neutrality is to avoid suspicion
that the Nobel Prize can be influenced by politics.
   Along with Mrs. Ekman, who at 56 is the youngest Academy member,
the other dissenters were Lars Gyllensten, a 71-year-old physician,
writer and Academy member for 23 years, and author Werner
Aspenstrom, 70.
   Gyllensten said such ``vague'' and ``obvious'' remarks from one
of the world's most influential literary bodies was in itself a
political statement.
   ``It must be regarded as political submissiveness ... which is
incompatible with the best traditions of the Academy and the brave
choices of Nobel winners that I have had the joy and honor to take
part in,'' he said, writing of his determination to quit.
   Gyllensten called his decision ``a personal tragedy'' but said
he could not accept the Academy's tiptoeing in sensitive political
matters.
   That ``makes it impossible to award good Nobel prizes,'' he
wrote in an open letter last month.
   There seems no room for compromise, since the academy decided
last month that to accept the three resignations would betray the
Academy's history.
   ``We are in a one-way street, and there is not much I can do,''
Gyllensten said.
   Members have quit the academy before, but never three at once.
   At the end of last century, Henning Hamilton, a senior
government official, was forced to resign over economic
irregularities in his business. Professor Johan Ihre, a Swedish
language expert, was then elected to the Academy but refused to
join.
   Some of the Academy's customs date back to 1786, when it was
founded by King Gustav III. Housed in the magnificent Stock
Exchange building in Old Town, it has for two centuries been
charged with the task of furthering the Swedish language and
literature.
   But it was Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, who made the
Academy world famous by assigning it the duty of awarding a
literature prize in his name, which it has done since 1901.
   The Academy emerges from its scholastic isolation just one time
a year, when at exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in October the
permament secretary announces the laureate.
   The members would like to keep it that way.

<HEAD>After 1,000 Days, Still No Word on Terry Waite</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoy
who sought to free American hostages in Lebanon and wound up being
kidnapped, marks his 1,000th day in captivity Sunday with no word
on his fate.
   Nothing has been heard of the envoy since he left the Riviera
Hotel in Moslem west Beirut at 7.30 p.m. on Jan. 20, 1987, to meet
with the Shiite Moslem kidnappers of two Americans he was trying to
free.
   In England, prayer vigils organized by the Church Army, the
Church of England's evangelical branch, were held Friday to mark
Waite's 1,000th day as a hostage.
   ``I really do think that he is still alive,'' his mother, Lena,
said. ``I feel he is. He would hate to be shut up like that, but I
am sure he will come through all right.''
   Waite was on his fifth mission to Beirut when he disappeared. He
told his tough Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort him
to the clandestine meeting at an undisclosed site.
   Well informed sources said at the time that Waite was driven to
the home of a Shiite Moslem physician who had acted as a
go-between. He was apparently to contact representatives of Islamic
Jihad, which holds U.S. hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland.
   Waite never returned, and it is widely believed he became a
captive of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem extremists.
   The 50-year-old envoy, a policeman's son who became the personal
emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, is one of five
Britons missing in Lebanon.
   Thirteen other Westerners, including eight Americans, are
missing. All Americans are believed held by Shiite factions.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held longer than any hostage. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Several rumors about Waite's fate have circulated. He has been
reported ill, killed, wounded while trying to escape, smuggled to
Iran in a coffin to stand trial as an American spy, and ransomed
for $7 million.
   No group has claimed to hold him and there have been no
photographs or videotapes to prove he is alive. The British
government says no demands have been made for his freedom.
   But other Western hostages freed since Waite disappeared have
reported seeing a man believed to be the towering 6-foot, 7-inch
Briton in an underground prison.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, who says he will pursue every lead
to try to free Waite, has accused the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, of holding Waite.
   Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for groups holding most
of the Westerners, denies the allegation.
   Ten days after Waite vanished, Runcie said the envoy had left
written instructions that he wanted no ransom paid or rescue
mission attempted if he was kidnapped during his mission.
   Waite's disappearance came months after the disclosure that the
United States had traded arms for hostages.
   Three Americans held by Islamic Jihad were freed following the
delivery of U.S. weapons to Iran in 1985-86 during its war with
Iraq.
   Waite had been credited with securing the release of the three _
the Rev. Benjamin Weir, the Rev. Laurence Jenco, and David Jacobson
_ until the U.S. dealings with Tehran were disclosed in November
1986.
   There have been reports Islamic Jihad decided to hold Waite
responsible for failing to secure the freedom of 15 pro-Iranian
extremists imprisoned in Kuwait for a string of 1983 bombings.
Freeing those men had been Islamic Jihad's main demand.

   A spare engine computer checked out
fine Saturday and NASA cleared space shuttle Atlantis for launch on
Tuesday with the Jupiter-bound Galileo probe.
   Officials said the countdown, interrupted after a previous
computer developed a problem, would resume at 12:01 a.m. Monday,
aiming for liftoff during a 26-minute period starting at 12:57 p.m.
Tuesday.
   The repair was accomplished with ``great efficiency by a
dedicated team often facing unfavorable weather conditions,'' said
Robert Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations. ``We can now
proceed to launch the Galileo mission to Jupiter.''
   The faulty computer, which forced postponement of a planned
Thursday launch, was removed and a spare installed Friday. Testing
of the new unit was completed Saturday and workers began closing up
the engine compartment, removing work platforms and reinstalling
heat shields.
   The 230-pound, $6 million computer controls all functions of one
of Atlantis' three main engines during launch. Its failure could
lead to an engine shutdown and an emergency landing for the shuttle.
   A long-range weather forecast said conditions on Tuesday will be
70 percent favorable. It said there was a 20 percent probability of
showers or thunderstorms and a 10 percent chance of winds from the
southeast exceeding the launch limit of 23 mph.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission were to return here
from their training base in Houston. They had gone back there after
the Thursday launch date was scrubbed.
   They are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley and
mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon
Lucid.
   During the five-day mission, the astronauts are to release the
nuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year
journey to Jupiter. The craft is to shoot a probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and orbit the planet, examining it for 22 months.
   A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a request by three
environmental groups to halt the flight for fear the Galileo could
scatter plutonium, its nuclear fuel, over Florida if the shuttle
exploded.
   The groups appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals on
Friday.
   Bruce Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one
of the three organizations, said that if the court rules against
them, opponents planned to try to infiltrate the launch area on
Tuesday in an effort to stop the liftoff.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loyalists and royalists rubbed shoulders
with communists and Islamic fundamentalists Saturday to register as
candidates in this kingdom's first general election in 22 years.
   ``It means we are returning back to democratic life,'' said poet
and journalist Abdul-Rahim Omar, who is seeking a parliamentary
seat in the capital. ``It means we will again have an independent
legislative authority.''
   Omar held one of the small blue number tags officials passed out
to control the flow of candidates as registration began in Amman.
   Officials have said 1,000 or more people are considering a run
for the 80 parliamentary seats being contested Nov. 8.
   It will be Jordan's first nationwide balloting since April 1967
_ a few months before the Middle East war with Israel. Of the
country's 3 million people, 1 million are registered voters.
   Candidates have three days to register, and officials then have
three days to reject those not considered qualified. Anyone
rejected by the regional governor can appeal to the courts, which
must rule in another three days.
   Although Jordanian law prohibits members of banned organizations
from seeking election, officials have hinted they will permit
members of the outlawed Communist Party and other leftist groups to
run.
   The law allowed official campaigning to begin Saturday, and
Amman residents awoke to find campaign banners suspended over city
streets and leaflets stuffed under windshield wipers of their cars.
   ``There is no glory except in Islam'' proclaimed a banner
hoisted by two Islamic candidates above a busy street in the Jebel
Hussein district.
   ``Woman is half of the society. She is the one who raises the
future generations,'' announced another banner directed at women,
who are taking part in nationwide voting for the first time in
Jordan's history.
   Women gained the vote in 1974, but only a handful of local
district elections have been held since then.
   Nationwide voting was impossible after 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank, because that territory contained half the
60 seats in Jordan's old Parliament.
   But King Hussein last year renounced claims to the West Bank in
favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the government
drew up plans for a new Parliament that will omit representation
for the West Bank for the first time since 1950.
   The Parliament elected in 1967 was suspended in 1974 and revived
a decade later with a few elections to fill gaps caused by death.
It was generally compliant to government will, despite a few vocal
critics.
   Most candidates and analysts have said the new Parliament will
take a more active role, especially following the widespread
rioting that erupted in April to protest price increases.
   Scores of candidates gathered Saturday morning at the Amman
governor's office to register. Tribal sheiks in flowing robes
waited in line, chatting with businessmen in suits and Islamic
fundamentalists.
   ``It feels great to have democracy back to our country under the
leadership of his majesty, King Hussein,'' said Hamad Abu Jamus, a
retired army brigadier general seeking election in Amman.
   ``We have been waiting for this for the past 22 years,'' he said.
   Dr. Ali Hawamdeh, a leader of the Moslem Brotherhood, said he
expected his and other Islamic groups to back about 30 candidates,
seeking morality, clean government, social justice and a hard line
toward Israel.
   The PLO has distanced itself from the election to avoid a
conflict with Jordan, but many candidates are appealing to
Palestinian sentiments, especially in Amman, where some 70 percent
of people come from Palestinian families.
   ``We salute the children of the stones,'' proclaimed a banner
raised by candidate Carlos Dames, referring to youths of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

   Four young men who pulled crab traps from
the St. Johns River while ``looking for a good time'' on a holiday
weekend began paying their their debt to society Saturday _ by
parading on a bridge with signs admitting their acts.
   The men carried hand-lettered signs reading: ``It is a felony
punishable by prison and-or a $5,000 fine to molest crab pots. I
know because I molested one.''
   As they trudged the two-tenths of a mile to the top of a bridge
over the St. Johns River and back down, the four were accompanied
by Michael West, a probation officer from this town about 50 miles
south of Jacksonville.
   All four refused to talk to reporters. A few motorists honked at
them, but no problems occurred.
   Jacksonville insurance salesman Stephen Michael Kittredge, one
of the four men caught raiding seven traps in May, said earlier
that too much beer and too little common sense were to blame.
   ``It was Memorial Day weekend. We were just a bunch of guys
looking for a good time. We were probably a little bit drunk. We
were wrong. We readily admit we were wrong,'' the 23-year-old
Kittredge said.
   He and pals John Shiver Snelling, 24, Gregory Coleman Dyer, 24,
and David Todd Harris, 23, agreed to walk with the
poster-board-size placards for four weekends in exchange for having
prosecutors drop charges.
   ``This a felony situation, and you are looking at guys that all
have careers,'' said Putnam County probation director Vicky Weaver.
   Robert Scholl, the fisherman who lost 30 crabs to the men, said
the public humiliation is not enough punishment. He wanted them
convicted and fined the maximum.
   ``You could shoot them at daylight and that might not satisfy
him,'' countered Ms. Weaver.
   Assistant State Attorney Richard Whitson said the public display
will do more to help the crabbing industry than jailing the four
men.
   Each man must also pay Scholl five times the cost of the lost
catch, or an estimated $675 each, Ms. Weaver said.
   Though unhappy with the punishment, Scholl acknowledged that
``it's going to be very expensive crab meat.''
   Fishermen leave the underwater traps unattended for hours,
attached to floating markers, while they make their rounds, picking
up their catch and replacing bait.
   A crab fisherman for 17 years, Scholl estimates he loses $1,000
a year in equipment to thefts, not counting the lost catch.
   The men walking the bridge Saturday also will carry signs on the
municipal dock and at the county courthouse on subsequent weekends.
   Kittredge and Harris, a real estate broker, live in
Jacksonville. Snelling is a law student living in Atlanta, and Dyer
is a sales representative in Fort Myers for a medical supply
company.
   Kittredge said the four men were spending the weekend on a
houseboat when a trap got caught in a boat propeller and rose to
the surface. They were arrested June 6 by sheriff's officers who
had been tipped off to the men's boat number.
   ``It looked like lunch in the pot to them. It could have been a
$5,000 lunch,'' Whitson said.

<HEAD>Pinochet To Dissolve Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said he plans
to dissolve the secret police agency that human rights activists
blamed Saturday for some of the most brutal and sinister crimes of
his iron-fisted regime.
   Pinochet, answering questions from local reporters Friday in the
southern town of Coihaique, said the National Information Center
will be scrapped before an elected civilian government takes power
in March.
   He said the agency will be phased out `because it is an organ
that served this government.''
   He did not elaborate, saying only: ``I can't say now what will
happen to its men.''
   Roberto Garreton, legal chief for the Solidarity Vicariate human
rights group, said the agency inflicted horrendous crimes on the
populace.
   ``Just as Pinochet recognizes, the CNI was at the service of his
government, which is to say at his service and not at the service
of the country. That's why the institution will disappear when the
government changes,'' he said.
   Pinochet, the army commander who seized power in a bloody 1973
coup, lost a referendum a year ago on extending his rule to 1997.
The loss obliged him to call elections, scheduled for December 14,
to pick a civilian successor who will take power March 11.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Garreton
said the secret police force ``has been linked to the most sinister
(activities) of the regime in recent years'' including the torture
and killing of leftists.
   The Solidarity Vicariate, sponsored by the local Roman Catholic
Church, is among the country's most respected human rights agencies.
   All three presidential candidates pledged to abolish the police
agency if elected.
   The agency was created in 1977 to replace another secret police
force, the National Intelligence Directorate, after it was linked
to the assassination of prominent dissidents abroad. The CNI's
directors all have been army generals, and most of its officers are
armed forces members.
   Former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi, opposition leader Patricio
Aylwin and independent businessman Francisco Errazuriz are running
for the presidency. Aylwin, backed by a 17-party center-left
coalition that triumphed in the referendum, leads by a substantial
margin in most polls.
   In his comments to reporters in Coihaique, 1,350 miles south of
Santiago, Pinochet also hinted at military action if armed forces
members are persecuted by the new government.
   ``The day they touch one of my men, the state of law ends,'' he
declared. ``I say this only once, and won't say it again, but they
know that's how it is.''
   Texts of his exchange with reporters were carried Saturday by
Santiago newspapers.
   Pinochet previously has warned he will not accept prosecution,
under the new government, of armed forces members on charges of
human rights abuse. Hundreds of cases of illegal arrest, torture
and other rights violations are pending in the Chilean courts.

   Mother Teresa left a hospital Saturday
five weeks after suffering a heart attack and headed straight for
the headquarters of her Missionaries of Charity, despite doctors'
advice to slow down.
   ``The mother is still very weak. She's going to need rest for
quiet some time,'' said Dr. Ashim Bardhan of the Woodlands Nursing
Home Hospital. He said she should give up her hectic schedule and
adjust to a slower lifestyle.
   The 79-year-old nun won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her
efforts to help the poor. She was hospitalized Sept. 5 with a high
fever and acute vomiting and suffered a heart attack three days

   Mother Teresa appeared to be recovering well but then developed
recurring chest pains and a high fever that was aggravated by an
infection. Doctors said her setback was caused by the strain of
meeting dignitaries who demanded to see her.
   Despite poor health in recent years, the Yugoslav-born nun has
traveled widely to offer care and comfort to the poor and suffering.
   Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in October
1959 in an abandoned hostel donated by the city of Calcutta. The
order, which was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, now
has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

   A race car sped off the road and into a
group of spectators Saturday, killing three people and injuring at
least seven, police said.
   The driver and the navigator were not injured when the
Peugeot-205 racer left the road during a minor auto rally near this
northern Italian city and sped into the crowd.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that two of the injured
were in critical condition.
   The accident occurred during a special trial of the so-called
``Rally of the Saint'' outside the town of Treporti di Teolo, in
the Padua province.
   Padua is called the city of the saint because it is the site of
the shrine of St. Anthony.

<HEAD>Town Recovering But Scars Remain More Than Three Weeks After Hugo</HEAD>

   More than three weeks after Hurricane
Hugo slammed into this bedroom community, the buzz of chainsaws
drowns out most sounds as the town struggles toward recovery.
   Schools are open again, the power is on, traffic is heavy on
Main Street and most businesses have reopened, but physical and
emotional scars from the hurricane run deep and will not be eased
anytime soon, residents say.
   ``Things will probably never be the same,'' resident Jessica
Brown said recently. ``This neighborhood is still in shock about a
lot of things.''
   Her house in the College Park subdivision suffered extensive
water damage when the Sept. 21 hurricane lifted the roof, moved the
house off its foundation and sent rain cascading into the attic.
   ``Things have hit us pretty hard,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``I lost a
10-month-old baby a week before the storm and we were trying to get
our lives back together. Then this happened.''
   An insurance adjuster has yet to make it to her house, but she
said she doesn't really mind ``because a lot of people are a lot
worse off than me.''
   Across South Carolina, the hurricane left 18 dead, 270,000
jobless, at least 50,000 homeless and $4 billion or more in damage.
   President Bush made a quick, unscheduled visit to this community
of 18,000 as part of his trip to the state a week after Hugo roared
through. He promised federal aid, and a few days later, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency opened a disaster center here.
   While other cities and towns such as Charleston, 20 miles to the
south; McClellanville and Sumter were hit harder and still struggle
to get life's necessities back, Summerville is edging toward
recovery.
   But the reminders of Hugo remain.
   Summerville was settled in the 1700s as South Carolina's first
resort by wealthy Charlestonians who sought refuge from the
disease-bearing mosquitoes which swarmed coastal marshes in the
summer.
   The town's centerpiece, Azalea Park, was awash during the spring
with crimson, lavender and white blossoms. Today, it is littered
with fallen pine trees and massive oaks now twisted and splintered
like matchsticks.
   Cars still have plastic covering smashed windows, piles of tree
limbs line the curbs waiting for removal, plywood has replaced
broken store windows and carpenters are busy patching damaged roofs.
   Yet, residents say, good things were spawned by the destruction.
   Neighbors finally got to know each other as they shared food,
cooked on outdoor grills and helped clear streets of fallen limbs.
   ``I'm closer to my friends and neighbors, some we didn't really
know,'' Leanne Junkins said. ``The friendship and caring that all
these people had for everybody else without putting a price tag on
it _ you can't beat that kind of love.''
   Now that schools have reopened, people are back to work and into
a routine again, it has been easier to cope with the devastation,
Mrs. Junkins said.
   In Diane Turocy's neighborhood, she became something of a
celebrity when a picture of her and President Bush was flashed
around the globe. It was a moment she never expected.
   ``We're starting to settle into a routine. We're just trying to
get on with our lives,'' she said, when a Secret Service agent
knocked at her door on the morning of Sept. 29.
   ``I greeted him in my nightgown and he said, `Would you like to
meet the president? You have two minutes.'''
   The visit ``was just a tremendous boost for a small town,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Fed Official Says No Credit Squeeze Seen; Contingency Plan Stays
on Shelf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surveying the wreckage from the second-largest
point decline in stock market history, Fed and Bush administration
officials reviewed contingency plans Saturday and tried to project
an air of calm watchfulness.
   Unlike his action following the record 508-point drop in the
stock market on Black Monday two years ago, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan did not issue a statement pledging that the
central bank stands ready to supply needed bank reserves to cushion
the new shock to the financial system.
   A Fed official, speaking on condition that his name not be used,
said such a statement was not necessary.
   He said reports coming in from commercial banks indicated that
none of them is facing a credit squeeze as a result of the Friday
market plunge, which wiped out nearly $200 billion in stock values.
   Greenspan's decisive action to supply plentiful credit to the
banking system two years ago won widespread praise at the time as a
key factor in keeping the market turmoil from sending the entire
economy into a tailspin.
   ``The contingency plan (drawn up by Greenspan) still exists, but
there has been no need to put it into effect,'' a Fed official said
Saturday.
   Officials said no thought is being given to canceling a
scheduled speech by Greenspan to the American Bankers' Association
on Monday. In 1987, Greenspan did cancel his planned address before
the ABA convention in Dallas to fly back to Washington to take
charge of monitoring market developments.
   For its part, the Bush administration sought to dismiss any
efforts to compare Friday's 190-point plunge to the 1987 crash.
   ``No one looks at this as anything at all like October 1987,''
said a Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush spent the wekend at Camp David, Md., and the
White House issued no statements on his behalf.
   Aides to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said he had discussed
Friday's developments with Greenspan and Richard Breeden, who was
sworn in three days ago as the new chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Brady, who also was in touch with officials at the New York
Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said in a
statement late Friday that the stock decline ``doesn't signal any
fundamental change in the condition of the economy'' with the
prospects still favorable for continued expansion.
   Private economists tended to agree with this assessment, saying
there are a variety of differences between 1989 and 1987.
   In the 1987 crash, interest rates were shooting upward and the
dollar was extremely weak, two factors that added to investor
uncertainty. This time, interest rates have been steady and the
dollar has been showing surprising strength.
   ``In 1987, we had an all-out panic,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer. ``This has been a collapse confined primarily to
leveraged-buyout activity which had been driving the market upward
this year.''
   Still, analysts said that Monday could be a rough day in the
markets, especially if Friday's weakness in New York spills over
into the Tokyo stock exchange when it opens late Sunday night.
   In 1987, a 109-point drop on Friday, Oct. 16, triggered selling
on foreign exchanges which then contributed to the 508-point plunge
on Monday.
   Michael Evans, a Washington economist who had predicted in his
most recent news letter that the stock market was on the verge of a
big sell-off, said Saturday he expects the market to drop an
additional 300 points.
   But Evans said even with this pessimistic outlook, he did not
expect the U.S. economy to be pushed into a recession.
   ``This doesn't tell us anything about the real economy. It tells
us that there has been a squeeze on corporate profits this year,''
he said.
   Many economists said they expected the Fed would begin pushing
interest rates lower in coming weeks, but that it will be very
gradual to avoid the appearance that the central bank was bowing to
political pressure from the administration, which has been pushing
for lower rates for some time.
   Jones said he was looking for the bellwether federal funds rate,
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, to fall
to 8 percent from the current 9 percent over the next two months.
He said he was also looking for a cut in the Fed's discount rate in
that time period.
   Many of the country's top corporate executives, at a meeting of
the Business Council in Hot Springs, Va., also expressed confidence
that Friday's market turmoil will have no significant impact on the
economy, which they said will slow next year but then rebound with
faster growth in 1991.
   A.W. Clausen, head of Bank of America, said the fact that
Greenspan led the country through the 1987 crash gave him
confidence government officials will know how to handle the current
turmoil.
   ``Allan Greenspan is a seasoned veteran. He managed our way
through the last time and I have utmost confidence in his
abilities,'' he said.
   But not all executives were as sanguine about the market's
immediate prospects.
   Rand V. Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., blamed a lack of
government controls on corporate takeovers for the speculative
fever which drove stock prices to unjustified highs.
   ``A lot of people are saying, `No problem. This isn't 1987.' But
who knows,'' he told reporters. ``If the Tokyo and London markets
stay stable, then it could stay stable here. But if they don't,
then we could have a rough time on Monday.''

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 East Germans in Poland will be
free to leave by plane or ship for West Germany or any other
country, it was announced Saturday in the latest concession by East
Berlin to the westward migration of its citizens.
   The official Polish news agency PAP said East Germany informed
Poland of its decision after meetings between the East German
deputy foreign minister and the Polish foreign minister.
   A West German official in Bonn said the departures could begin
Monday. The refugees will be joining about 50,000 other citizens
who have fled their Communist homeland in recent weeks.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said one refugee who came to Poland with a
tour group and then slipped away to Warsaw. ``Freedom, and then I
will be happy.''
   Also Saturday, East Germany's state-run media engaged in a rare
show of public debate, publishing workers' complaints about
conditions in their troubled nation.
   Western diplomatic sources say more than 950 East Germans have
taken refuge in either the West German Embassy in Warsaw or in
shelters in the city.
   The refugees, including many families with small children, have
made their way to Poland since more than 1,400 of their countrymen
left here for the West on Oct. 1 and Oct. 5.
   Those refugees and more than 13,000 who had occupied the West
German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, were required to pass
through East Germany in trains before being formally expelled to
the West.
   The new plan drops that requirement, allowing the East Germans
to fly out of Poland once they obtain the necessary documents.
   This could spare East Germany a repeat of the near riots that
occurred in some East German cities when citizens tried to climb
aboard the trains going West.
   Smiling young refugees being housed at a church seminary in
Tarchomin, just outside Warsaw, said they were told Saturday night
by a West German diplomat that transport either by air or ship was
being arranged for them by the end of the week.
   The refugees, mainly skilled workers in their 20s and 30s, said
they celebrated with beer, vodka and music after they first got
hints of the deal from West German radio broadcasts.
   ``We were all in one room when we heard, and things were wild,''
said a young man washing dishes in the seminary kitchen.
   As some of the 120 refugees at the seminary were sitting down to
supper, a young West German diplomat was handing out a single-sheet
form titled, ``Request for Release from Citizenship of the German
Democratic Republic.'' Refugees were eagerly filling it out.
   It was unclear if the arrangement announced Saturday would apply
to East Germans who make their way to Warsaw in the future. Despite
East German attempts to limit travel to Poland by not issuing exit
permits, about 120 East Germans have been arriving daily.
   Poland maintains it is trying to prevent illegal border
crossings. But once East Germans are safely past the Polish border,
authorities have been taking no steps to determine the legality of
their entry.
   Instead, Polish officials have been working privately with the
Roman Catholic Church and the Polish Red Cross to provide
comfortable housing for the refugees.
   East Germany's main party newspapers Saturday covered a broad
range of political and economic concerns that have fueled the
nationwide unrest.
   The depth and extent of the criticism was unparalleled in the
40-year history of East Germany's drab print media, which
traditionally have devoted most space to reports on production
successes and attacks on the West.
   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland published 22
letters from concerned readers.
   ``I believe it's time for a thorough explanation about the
causes of the tense and uneasy situation in our country,'' wrote
Karin Hornig. ``The time has come for our media to report what's
really going on in the country.''
   Manuela Auras, from the small town of Aue, wrote: ``My
colleagues and I hope that there will be constructive changes,
especially in the media, in travel possibilities and in industry.''
   Neues Deutschland also published lengthy articles in which
workers blasted visiting party officials about work conditions,
unfair pay scales and travel restrictions.

<HEAD>Dole Says She Will Appoint ``Super Mediator''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole on Saturday
convened the first meeting of the heads of the Pittston Company and
the United Mine Workers since a strike began six months ago, and
said she would soon appoint a ``super mediator'' in a new effort to
end the coalfield war.
   A day after she visited both strikers and company officials in
Virginia coal towns, Mrs. Dole presided over a 90-minute session in
her office with Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas and UMW President
Richard Trumka. She called it ``a very good meeting,'' and said,
``Both these gentlemen are committed to ending this dispute, and
agreed ... that I appoint a super mediator.
   ``This will be a person of stature, and I will make that
appointment just as soon as feasible,'' the labor secretary said.
   Both Douglas and Trumka left her office without commenting to
reporters. The two had not met since 1,695 miners in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky went on strike April 5 against Pittston Coal
Group, Inc.'s mines in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The
parent Pittston Company is based in Greenwich, Conn.
   Talks between lower-level negotiators, conducted for weeks under
the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,
have produced virtually no progress. Mrs. Dole lauded the FMCS
effort, but acknowledged it was time to try something different.
   She characterized her tour Friday as emotionally wrenching,
saying, ``I saw families against families, brothers against
brothers _ this is tearing entire communities apart.''
   ``The time is right,'' she said, ``for me to offer my offices to
move forward with a super mediator.''
   Health benefits, not wages, are chiefly at issue in the dispute.
Pittston bolted from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association last
year, saying the nationwide contract the association had negotiated
with the UMW gave too much to the miners, particularly in medical
benefits for pensioners. The company then sought to negotiate its
own contract and reduce those benefits.
   Trumka had asked repeatedly to meet directly with Douglas, but
Douglas had declined until Mrs. Dole invited both men to her
office. Douglas previously had argued that local managers were
better qualified to address the mining issues.
   The strike has become a rallying point for organized labor
across the country. Union leaders contend the company is attempting
to break the UMW with a contract that would threaten the stability
of the union's pension fund. Pittston has denied trying to rid
itself of organized employees.

<HEAD>Solidarity Journalist Named Editor of Government Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Solidarity journalist and
political activist was named editor in chief of the government
daily, the state news agency reported Saturday. The move further
consolidates Solidarity's growing media presence.
   Dariusz Fikus, 57, was chosen by Solidarity Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki to replace Janusz Durmala, a Communist Party
member, as head of the Rzeczpospolita daily, the PAP news agency
said.
   Fikus said in a telephone interview he hoped the newspaper would
represent the different groups in the government and appeal to the
average citizen.
   ``A coalition is in power now, so one should present different
interests, show various stands, but at the same time depict the
stand of the government with affection,'' Fikus said.
   The new non-Communist government was confirmed by Parliament
Sept. 12. It consists of Solidarity supporters and members of its
two coalition parties as well as the Communist Party.
   Fikus is the second Solidarity member to take over a major state
media organization since the East bloc's first non-Communist
government was formed.
   Last month, Mazowiecki named opposition journalist Andrzej
Drawicz to head the committee that controls state television and
radio.
   Fikus has been a journalist for more than 30 years, first in the
Communist-controlled press and later in independent and
Solidarity-linked publications.
   A Communist Party member from 1959-81, Fikus developed links to
the independent oppostion in the late 1970s and took part in talks
on Solidarity's access to radio and television during the union's
first legal phase in 1980-81.
   He said that journalists who decided they did not want to work
under him as editor would be free to leave. Until now, the paper
has been run mainly by members of the Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
was to be interred Sunday in a shedlike mausoleum that family
members insist is a temporary entombment until his body can be
buried in his homeland.
   The mausoleum was contructed last week largely by volunteers on
a hillside overlooking the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park,
said Joe Lazo, head of a Honolulu-based group called the Friends of
Marcos.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has repeatedly refused to
allow Marcos' body to be returned to the Philippines, saying it
could create unrest by Marcos supporters.
   In an effort to prevent the Philippine Supreme Court from
overturning Mrs. Aquino's ban, government attorneys last week
accused the Marcos family of plotting to assassinate Mrs. Aquino,
but gave few details.
   A funeral Mass for Marcos was held Friday night, attended by
more than 1,500 people who packed into St. Theresa cathedral,
Honolulu's largest Roman Catholic church.
   Monsignor Domingo Nebres of the Philippines delivered the eulogy
and likened Marcos to Jesus for suffering and forgiving those who
betrayed him.
   ``Christ was a victim of the people's power, so Marcos was a
victim of the people's power,'' said Nebres, who had been Marcos'
friend for 12 years.
   ``My beloved president would say, `Do not cry for me. ... Cry
for your country,''' he said.
   Marcos died in exile Sept. 28 at age 72 following nine months in
a hospital for a variety of major ailments.
   During the Mass, his widow, Imelda, covered her face with a
black veil and clutched a silver rosary.
   When the casket was opened following the hour-long Mass, Mrs.
Marcos kissed the clear plastic covering it and placed a single
white lily there.
   She made no comment to reporters.

   The population of the war-devastated city
of Faw will be allowed to return later this month, the governor of
neighboring Basra said Saturday.
   Iraq is planning major celebrations Oct. 25 to mark the
inauguration of the new city and its reopening to civilians. The
port city of about 50,000 people was evacuated immediately after
the Iran-Iraq war broke out in September 1980.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the war in August 1988, but
subsequent peace talks have deadlocked.
   President Saddam Hussein has sent special envoys to all Arab
leaders inviting them to attend the celebrations, but there is no
word yet on who the guests will be.
   Anwar Saeed al-Hadithi, governor of Basra, said the new governor
of Faw, Najib Mouhamad Salman, has already assumed office along
with other government officials.
   Al-Hadithi said life will return to normal in Faw, which lies on
the west bank of the Shatt Al-Arab waterway. The cease-fire line
runs down the middle of the disputed waterway.
   Faw was virtually destroyed during the war.
   The government has rebuilt offices, schools, hospitals and
repaved the streets.
   Al-Hadithi said the government has allocated plots of land to
each family that used to live in Faw to rebuild a new house, and
has given them $30,000 each.
   All rivers and the irrigation system in the area were cleaned so
that farmers can start planting for the winter growing season.

   Michael Landon said he prevailed over NBC
when network officials asked him to change the title of his
film-in-progress, ``Where Pigeons Go To Die.''
   Landon was in Lawrence to film the story, based on a book by
Robert Campbell of the same title, about a boy and his grandfather
who raise homing pigeons.
   ``They asked me and I said no,'' Landon said Friday, adding that
the network officials thought the title was too long and didn't
like having the word ``die'' in it.
   ``You owe some kind of respect to the man who wrote the book,''
Landon said. ``I think they liked something stunning like, `Welcome
Home Grandfather.'''
   Landon is producing the movie for NBC, and the film could air on
the network as early as February. He also wrote the screenplay and
stars in it with Art Carney.
   ``Where Pigeons Go To Die'' is ``a flashback, the remembrances
of a man who 40 years before had a special relationship with his
grandfather,'' Landon said.
   Landon said about 40 percent of the shooting will take place in
Lawrence, a college town about 35 miles west of Kansas City, Mo.

<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities flew three suspected drug
traffickers to jails in Florida and Michigan early Saturday in the
second extradition from Colombia since emergency measures were
imposed there in August.
   One of them has already been convicted, in absentia, in Detroit.
Florida prosecutors called one of the others a ``big fish.''
   U.S. marshals said the three were turned over to U.S. officials
in Colombia about 3 a.m. and flown to Miami, where one was dropped
off. The flight then continued to Orlando and Detroit to deliver
the other two. Marshals said the three were being held in
``secure'' detention facilities in the three areas, but declined to
be more specific.
   The extraditions bring to four the number of people brought to
this country from Colombia since President Virgilio Barco imposed
emergency measures against drug traffickers Aug. 18.
   ``I commend President Barco and the government of Colombia for
their continued diligence in the war against narcoterrorists,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``The Colombian people are setting an example for the world as
they continue to extradite international drug traffickers in the
face of continued threats and acts of intimidation,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel identified the three
defendants as Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, Roberto Peter Carlini-Arrico
and Bernardo Pelaez Roldan.
   The U.S. Marshals Service said de Tamayo, 50, faces charges in
Miami of cocaine importation and conspiracy to possess with intent
to distribute cocaine.
   Carlini-Arrico, 38, faces federal charges of possession with
intent to distribute 7,000 pounds of marijuana and importing 7,000
pounds of marijuana in the Middle District of Florida at Orlando,
marshals said.
   Three other defendants in that federal case are in custody, and
the trial is scheduled for November, Runkel said.
   Assistant State Attorney Andy Zelman said Carlini-Arrico is
accused by state authorities of smuggling more than a ton of
cocaine during the mid-1980s.
   State prosecutor Peter Antonacci said the 1986 state charges
against Carlini-Arrico consist of one count each of racketeering,
conspiracy to commit racketeering, cocaine trafficking and
conspiracy to traffic the drug. Each state count carries a 15-year
mandatory minimum sentence.
   Carlini-Arrico, who had Florida addresses in Boca Raton and
Gainesville, fled the country following the state indictments, said
Antonacci.
   ``He is a big fish,'' said Antonacci. ``We are glad we'll get a
chance to prosecute.''
   Pelaez, 44, was convicted in absentia in Detroit in March 1984
of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine.
   Barco allowed extradition among other emergency measures that
followed the assassination of a leading presidential candidate who
was an outspoken foe of the drug trade.
   Colombia's supreme court has upheld the decision to resume
extraditions to the United States. In 1987, it had blocked
extraditions.
   The first reputed drug trafficker extradited since the emergency
actions went into effect was Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was taken
to the United States on Sept. 6 to face money laundering charges
brought in March in Atlanta.
   Since Barco imposed the emergency measures, drug traffickers in
Colombia have declared ``total war'' on the government. They have
been held responsible for setting off more than 150 bombs that have
killed more than 10 people and wounded at least 200.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Some Long-Range Benefit in Market Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders
tallied losses in their personal stock portfolios on Saturday, but
many said the market collapse a day earlier could be a boon if its
cools a corporate takeover fever.
   The 190-point plunge of the Dow Jones industrial average Friday
was a surprise intruder at the Business Council's fall meeting,
held at a posh resort in the Blue Ridge mountains.
   The market's plunge wiped out $200 billion of stock values
overall, leaving many of the executives poorer, on paper, than when
they arrived.
   George Keller, retired chairman of Chevron Corp., said he
figured the one-day market drop had cost him $250,000. Other
executives traded similar tales of woe.
   Despite the precipitous drop in stock values for their
companies, however, many of the executives expressed belief that
some good could come from the market correction if it ends the
takeover fever that has been driving stock prices this year.
   Much of the loss occurred in the last hour of trading on Friday
after news reports that the pending takeover of UAL Corp., parent
of United Airlines, was in jeopardy because of financing problems.
   This sparked fears among stock traders that the surge of
multibillion-dollar corporate takeovers was coming to an end and
helped trigger the selling frenzy, many analysts believe.
   Since many of the corporate executives have had to fend off
unwanted takeovers in the past, something that dampened this
activity could be seen as a welcome development in their eyes.
   For example, one executive at the meeting, American Airlines
President Robert L. Crandall, is currently facing a takeover bid
from New York real estate developer Donald Trump.
   Asked if Friday's developments could help him fend off Trump's
bid, Crandall merely smiled and said, ``No comment.''
   Rand V. Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., was more blunt in his
criticism of the Reagan and Bush administrations for doing nothing
to curb speculative takeovers.
   ``We have a very nervous marketplace,'' he said. ``Are the
lawyers and investment bankers in charge or is the president of the
United States in charge?''
   He said the whole attitude of deregulation of the marketplace
over the past eight years was not contributing to the long-term
growth prospects of the United States.
   Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp., said Friday's market
decline could end up being a good thing if market speculators are
replaced by long-term investors.
   ``I am anxious to see the market move up, but I am anxious to
see it move up on investments and not speculation,'' he said.
``That will be better for the country.''
   Many of the business executives were hesitant to make
predictions about what might happen when the markets open again
Monday.
   ``The markets have had enormous growth and now an adjustment
process has set in,'' said IBM Chairman John Akers. ``The markets
do what the markets want to do.''
   While Murray denied that any crisis atmosphere existed, John F.
McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., said,
``Anytime you have the market drop by (190) points, if you aren't
concerned, there's something wrong with you.''
   General Motors Chairman Roger Smith refused to make a prediction
on whether Friday's plunge would be followed by further selling
Monday, saying it was hard to guess what the market's ``herd
instinct'' might do.
   ITT's Araskog agreed. ``Everybody can tell everybody to be calm,
cool and collected,'' he said, ``but when they start trading, calm,
cool and collected doesn't work any more.''

   They had to change some of the songs at
Deerfield Academy this fall. It hardly seemed appropriate to sing
about the ``sons of Deerfield,'' after 123 girls got to the prep
school.
   And the library sculpture, ``The Deerfield Boy,'' is getting a
sister statue in ``The Deerfield Girl.''
   But students and administrators said those are just cosmetic
changes that don't begin to tell the story of what it means to
reverse 41 years of history as an all-male school.
   ``When you see the girls on campus sometimes you double-take,''
said Ryan Scannell, a 15-year-old junior from Worcester. ``But I'm
used to it now.''
   A few boys have refused to sing the new gender-neutral version
of an old school song, steadfastly singing ``The sons of Deerfield
rally,'' as the first line, instead of ``Deerfield! O Deerfield
rally.''
   One of the new arrivals said she understands those feelings.
   ``There's 40 some odd years of Deerfield that are just sort of
locked up in that song,'' said Rachel Reingold, a 16-year-old
sophomore from Greenwich, Conn., who reports that her welcome was
warmer than she expected.
   Deerfield, a collection of elegant brick buildings clustered in
the historic section of old Deerfield, was founded by Frank L.
Boyden just after the turn of the century. It originally was a coed
school, but in 1948, the school went all-boy after the number of
female students dwindled to just a handful. The changeover back to
coeducation was approved in 1987.
   The headmaster said during the years of planning for the change,
they were told to expect some initial ``academic distraction'' as
boys and girls socialized.
   Students put it more bluntly. ``In two or three more weeks
there'll be, like, couples everywhere,'' Reingold said.
   The 123 girls account for about a fifth of the student body of
502 boarders and 68 day students.

   Palestinians observed a general strike in the
occupied territories Saturday to protest prison conditions in
Israel, and nine Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with
soldiers.
   The strike followed a week of violence between Israeli troops
and Palestinians that left 10 Palestinians dead.
   It was called by the Islamic Resistance Movement or ``Hamas,''
whose spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, is in an Israeli prison.
   Human rights groups, including the London-based Amnesty
International, have often criticized conditions at Israeli
detention facilities.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said more than 40,000
Palestinians have been detained during the 22-month-old uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied territories.
   According to the latest military figures, a total of 9,392
Palestinians are currently held in detention centers.
   Sporadic protests erupted in at least four refugee camps in the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
   In separate clashes in the Gaza Strip, seven Palestinians were
wounded in the Jabaliya and Beach refugee camps, hospital officials
said.
   One victim was 10-year-old Yusef Hassan Abureallah, who was shot
in the chest with a plastic bullet, doctors at Nasser Hospital
said. He was in moderate condition.
   In the Balata and Askar refugee camps in the West Bank, two
Arabs suffered gunshot wounds, including a 14-year-old girl, Arab
reports said.
   
   The army clamped a curfew on the villages of Kafr Malik and
Qibya in the West Bank after soldiers wounded three youths as they
dispersed demonstrations there, the military said.
   Israel television reported that foreign journalists and
cameramen had been invited to the villages by the residents to
witness the demonstrations.
   The army also confirmed that four other Arabs were wounded
during the day and said it was checking the other reports.
   Doctors in Beersheba, meanwhile, amputated the legs of an
Israeli man who was run down in Gaza Friday, Israel radio said. The
army said the Arab driving the car intentionally struck the Israeli.
   At least 593 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and
civilians during the revolt. Forty Israelis have died in the
violence.
   Another 129 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians.
Most have been accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy was sentenced to 30 years
in prison Saturday for fatally shooting a rafter on the Rio Grande
last year.
   A Presidio County jury Friday found Eduardo Rodriguez Pineda
guilty in the attack after a weeklong trial. The jury sentenced
Rodriguez on Saturday. In Texas, the judge or jury may set
punishment at the option of the defendant.
   Authorities said Rodriguez was one of four youths who stood atop
300-foot-high canyon walls overlooking the river on Nov. 19, 1988,
and fired shots that struck and killed Michael Heffley, 40, of
Eastland. His wife, Jamie, and their rafting guide were wounded.
   The shots were fired from the Mexican side of the river, and
under international law, a person standing in one country who
fatally shoots a person in another country can be tried in either
nation.
   ``I am disappointed,'' said Mrs. Heffley. ``They took into
account his age, but he didn't take into account my husband's life.
The Bible says, `Thou shall not kill.'''
   Defense attorneys asked the jury to give Rodriguez probation.
Prosecutors had requested a life sentence.
   Asked if he had anything to say, Rodriguez said through an
interpreter, ``Yes, I just want to ask for forgiveness for that
with which I have been charged.''
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal.
   Two juveniles are in custody in Mexico in connection with the
case. All three are Mexican citizens, but Rodriguez is a legal
resident of the United States and lives in Redford, 60 miles
northwest of Big Bend National Park.

<HEAD>40 Bodies Discovered Near Colombo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty bodies, many piled on burning
tires, were found in a nearby town, bringing a weeklong death toll
to more than 200, the government said Saturday.
   Authorities blamed no specific group for the killings, which
occurred since Friday night in and around Kelaniya, five miles
north of Colombo, but pro-government vigilantes were believed
responsible.
   A government statement said the deaths brought to 211 the number
of people killed in the past week, including 121 by vigilantes, 94
by Sinhalese radicals and 36 extremists by security forces.
   Independent sources claimed the toll was about 350, which would
be the most in a week in recent months.
   Sinhalese radicals in the ultranationalist People's Liberation
Front have attacked the Sinhalese-dominated government since the
signing of a peace accord in July 1987 designed to give greater
autonomy to the island nation's Tamil minority. A 6-year-old Tamil
separatist war has left at least 11,000 people dead.
   Human rights groups say the vigilante groups indiscriminately
kill civilians who associate with the Liberation Front and burn
their bodies beyond recognition.
   The government admits the existence of death squads but denies
large scale killings. It blames the front for most of the 5,000
deaths since 1987 in southern and central Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese
heartland.
   The front has rejected President Ranasinghe Premadasa's peace
offers, including repeated invitations to a peace conference that
ended Thursday.
   The front claims to be a Marxist organization but increasingly
has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the Sinhalese, who
are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the country's 16
million people. Tamils account for 18 percent of the population and
are mostly Hindus.

<HEAD>Some Quotations From Nancy Reagan Book Excerpts From Newsweek</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nancy Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some excerpts from Nancy Reagan's new book ``My Turn:
The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan,'' as provided by Newsweek magazine.
   Of her own advice to her husband: ``I make no apologies for
telling him what I thought. For eight years, I was sleeping with
the president, and if that doesn't give you special access, I don't
know what does! So yes, I gave Ronnie my best advice whenever he
asked for it, and sometimes when he didn't. But that doesn't mean
he took it. Ronald Reagan has a mind of his own, believe me, if I
was really the dragon lady that Donald Regan described in his book,
he would have been out the door many months earlier.''
   On her life in the White House: ``While I loved being First
Lady, and I loved being able to make a contribution, nevertheless,
my eight years with that title were the most difficult years of my
life. In addition to the painful moments, illness, the death of my
mother and father, there was the constant schedule and pressure;
and there was the difficulty of living under the intense scrutiny
of the media, the frustration of frequently being misunderstood.''
   On her Soviet counterpart, Raisa Gorbachev: ``From the moment we
met, she talked and talked and talked _ so much that I could barely
get a word in, edgewise or otherwise. Perhaps it was insecurity on
her part, but during about a dozen encounters in three different
countries, my fundamental impression of Raisa Gorbachev was that
she never stopped talking. Or lecturing, to be more accurate.''
   On onetime Secretary of State Al Haig: ``As far as I'm
concerned, Al Haig represented Ronnie's biggest mistake of the
first term. He was too power-hungry (and) obsessed with matters of
status.''
   On her relationship with astrologer Joan Quigley, which she
began after the assassination attempt and continued until its
disclosure created an uproar: ``Joan was helpful and comforting. We
had a professional relationship, but I came to view her as a
friend. I now see that she was also a kind of therapist. ... All
during those years, Joan Quigley was there for me.'' She says the
only thing influenced by Quigley's advice was Reagan's schedule;
``no political decision was ever made based on it.'' Quigley's
advice, paid by a third party who was then reimbursed by Mrs.
Reagan, ``wasn't cheap,'' but she doesn't say how much she was paid.
   On the 1981 assassination attempt in which Reagan was seriously
wounded: ``I couldn't help thinking about the fact that John
Hinckley had been possessed with the movie `Taxi Driver,' about a
deranged man who stalks a politician. ... I think there's too much
violence in films and on television, and it's one of the reasons
for our terrible problems with crime.'' She says she also is ``not
sure'' she agrees with her husband that gun control is not the
answer.
   On her alleged status as a clothes-horse: ``It infuriated me to
read that I had been part of the lunch bunch who spend their days
shopping on Rodeo Drive. I know there are women who shop every day,
and who center their lives on lunch, but I didn't do that before
moving into the White House and I don't do it now. It would bore
the daylights out of me.'' She says however that ``I do enjoy
wearing fine clothes'' and felt she should particularly look her
best when representing the nation. She says borrowing clothing from
designers, as she did, is ``such a widespread and accepted practice
in the American fashion industry that it never occurred to me that
I'd be criticized for it.''
   On her relationship with her daughter Patti Davis, who wrote a
novel in 1986 that was an unflattering portrait of a fictional
first family: ``I've had my ups and downs with all four children,
but my relationship with Patti has been one of the most painful and
disappointing aspects of my life. Somehow, no matter what I do, we
seem to square off.'' She says she read the novel, ``Home Front,''
``with sorrow and anger'' and that Patti and her brother, Ron,
haven't spoken since he told her ``you trashed us all in a terrible
book.''
   On a meeting with Rosalynn Carter a few weeks after Reagan
defeated President Carter in the 1980 election: ``The chill in her
manner matched the chill in the room. I was disappointed, but I
also understood. As I eventually learned for myself, the White
House is not an easy place to leave.'

   The Syrian MiG-23 fighter jet flown to Israel
this week by a pilot who defected contains advanced Soviet-designed
equipment never before examined by the West, a military official
said Saturday.
   ``It is a dream come true for every chief of intelligence to
have an enemy aircraft which ... can now be evaluated and test
flown,'' said reserve Brig. Gen. Oded Erez, a former Israeli
fighter pilot and a former head of air force intelligence.
   The Syrian air force pilot landed the jet in Israel Wednesday
and asked for asylum.
   Erez said on Israel radio that the MiG-23 contains advanced
avionics, missile and warning systems and radar.
   ``I think we might even be pioneers in the Western world to have
a firsthand touch with the material,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel
would share some of the knowledge it gained from inspecting and
flying the Soviet-built jet fighter.
   ``Of course it will serve as a source of information for us and
the others,'' including the United States, Rabin said on Israel
television.
   The Syrian pilot flew into Israel without being intercepted and
military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron appointed a team to
investigate the matter. It is expected to submit its conclusions by
Monday.

<HEAD>Two More Provincial Soldiers Charged With Stealing Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two provincial soldiers were
charged Saturday with stealing government file photos of Irish
Republican Army suspects who later became the targets of assassins.
   That brought to eight the number of soldiers from the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a largely Protestant army unit in the British
province, who have been charged in the investigation of leaks from
within the security services.
   People claiming to be Protestant gunmen have said they used such
documents to pick assassination targets, including a Roman Catholic
man slain in August. Two members of the Ulster regiment have been
charged in the murder.
   The two charged Saturday, Lance Cpl. Wallace Francis Andrews,
25, and Pvt. Steven Harris, 20, appeared at a special court in
Lisburn. They are accused of stealing government file photographs
on Aug. 12.
   The documents disappeared from Dunmurry police station in south
Belfast.
   Both soldiers were granted bail of $312.
   Twenty-eight members of the Ulster Defense Regiment were
arrested in raids on homes last Sunday that also turned up
government security documents and ammunition.
   The mainly Catholic IRA has killed 180 regiment members in its
20-year battle to end British rule and unite the province with the
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland. By police count, 2,759 people
have died in political killings since the violence began in 1969.

   Rain fell Saturday in parts of New York state and clouds covered
much of the Northeast, while residents along the Louisiana coast
prepared for Tropical Storm Jerry.
   Thunderstorms north of a warm front curving through the Great
Lakes region and the middle Atlantic Coast states produced golf
ball-sized hail in Grayling in northern lower Michigan and 1-inch
hail at Mio and Hartsville.
   The Gulf Coast region and the southern Atlantic Coast states
were also cloudy, with showers mainly in Georgia and South Carolina.
   Tropical Storm Jerry was about 350 miles south-southwest of New
Orleans on Saturday evening and was moving north-northeast at about
6 mph.
   Skies were partly cloudy across much of the western half of the
country. Sunny skies prevailed from the southern Plains to the Ohio
Valley and temperatures were warming into the 80s.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in Beckley,
W.Va., 78 degrees; Fort Wayne, Ind., 84; and South Bend, Ind., 85.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 states Saturday morning was
Gunnison, Colo., with a low of 21 degrees.

<HEAD>Speelman Defeats Timman to Move Level; Karpov, Yusupov Draw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jon Speelman of England scored a crushing 30-move
victory over Jan Timman of the Netherlands in the seventh round of
their World Chess Championship semifinal Saturday to tie the score
at 3.5 with one game remaining.
   In the other semifinal, former world champion Anatoly Karpov
held on to draw his sixth game with fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in
46 moves and keep the score at 3-3.
   Speelman, playing black, staged his dramatic comeback after poor
play in his first six games. It came at a time when observers were
begining to write off his chances in the eight-game contest.
   ``Jon played just like his old self,'' said an ecstatic Jonathan
Tisdall, an international master who is Speelman's chief second.
``As soon as he had a chance he played sharply and very
aggressively.''
   Despite playing with the advantage of the white pieces, Karpov,
who was world champion from 1975 until 1985, drifted into an
unfavorable endgame where experts said Yusupov missed two chances
to win his second game in a row and go ahead in the contest.
   ``I've never seen Karpov play so badly,'' said British
Grandmaster Tony Miles.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game duel beginning
in October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the
Candidates' final next March.
   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, a two-game ``mini match''
will be played, followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers
played at increasingly high speeds.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   Speelman shocked observers on the third move when he played an
old defense against Timman's Ruy Lopez opening rarely seen in
top-flight chess for the last 60 years.
   Surprised by the unusual idea, Timman sank deep into thought,
but a faulty 16th move let Speelman seize the initiative. Timman
used up more and more time and left himself with only 26 minutes'
thinking time for 20 moves.
   As Speelman turned on the pressure, Timman cracked. His 27th
move led to a sequence of moves in which Speelman won a bishop.
   When Timman resigned, the crowd in the Sadler's Wells ballet
theater rose for a standing ovation, but with the two Soviets still
locked in battle, Speelman gestured to the crowd to be quiet.
   After Speelman left the stage, Timman remained in his seat for
five minutes and watched the Karpov-Yusupov game on the electronic
demonstration boards.
   Asked about his chances to win the contest, Speelman said,
``better than this morning.''
   From a Queen's Gambit, Yusupov produced a new idea on the 17th
move and gradually outplayed Karpov by combining threats against
his king and in the center.
   By the 30th move, the protagonists had exchanged down to an
endgame with rooks and pawns, where Yusupov stood a pawn ahead.
   Soviet International Master Mark Dvoretsky, Yusupov's chief
second, told reporters Yusupov missed two ways to win on moves 37
and 38. When Yusupov missed his chances, Karpov initiated a series

   Panicky investors placed sell orders Saturday as
Wall Street and government officials conferred on the stock
market's Friday the 13th, fearing a replay of the 1987 crash when
the market reopens Monday.
   Charles Schwab &amp; Co., one of the nation's largest discount
brokerages, opened its 110 branches for four hours Saturday and was
flooded with thousands of calls from worried investors who wanted
to sell stock.
   New York Stock Exchange President Richard A. Grasso spoke by
telephone with officials in Washington, at other major exchanges
and at brokerages to discuss the drop in the market.
   ``We're not taking unusual actions today because we feel
confident that we have put procedures, systems and safeguards in
place over the past two years so that we are adequately prepared
for any level of activity that may occur on Monday,'' NYSE
spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said.
   The amount of money available to the stock market following the
selloff, the reaction overseas and the future of takeovers all were
of concern over the weekend.
   ``It's fair to say that people were working. They're analyzing
what happened in the market,'' said Securities and Exchange
Commission spokeswoman Mary McCue. ``I think people will be working
tomorrow (Sunday) too.''
   She declined to elaborate on what regulators were analyzing or
speculate on what steps the SEC might take in the event of a severe
market drop. The agency doesn't have the authority to halt trading
or close any stock exchanges. Only the chairmen of the exchanges
and President Bush have those powers.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
plummeted 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26, erasing
nearly $200 billion in stocks' paper value. The plunge was spurred
by an announcement that financing was unavailable for a $6.75
billion buyout of United Airlines arent UAL Corp.
   In points, the drop was the second-largest in history behind the
508-point Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, 1987. The crash was
preceded by a decline of 108 points the Friday before.
   San Francisco-based Charles Schwab received 3,000 orders within
one hour of opening, with 90 percent on the sell side, senior vice
president Hugo Quackenbush said.
   ``People are concerned because it reminds them of the '87 crash
when people got completely out of control,'' Quackenbush said.
   But he said some customers who called later wanted to buy into
the fallen market. Quackenbush expected heavy activity Monday, and
said the firm was boosting staff by up to 30 percent.
   As in 1987, traders and key officials have the weekend to plan
strategy and mull the possibility of a precipitous fall.
   ``The extent of the panic that we had in '87 is very different
than what we had now,'' Jack Barbanel, president of First Global
Asset Management Inc., said Saturday. ``Yesterday I would call a
reasonably orderly selloff as opposed to what we had in '87.''
   Some analysts said the economy's recent underlying strength, low
interest rates and a buoyant dollar distinguish current conditions
from 1987.
   ``There's clearly some nervousness associated with this decline,
but I think fundamentals will prevail,'' said Jack Lavery, director
of global equities markets at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of a House subcommittee
that oversees the SEC, said he would request from regulators a
reconstruction of Friday's trading.
   ``This is the second heart attack, two years after the first,''
said Markey, who has proposed market reform legislation. ``It's
about time we made the changes necessary to avoid a third.''
   Officials at the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank,
were reported confident that the market had enough ``liquidity''
that no emergency supply of money was necessary at the moment.
   In the event of a sharp selloff, stock trading firms might need
to borrow large amounts of additional money from banks to meet
their financial obligations in order to keep the system flowing
smoothly.
   After the 1987 crash, some banks were reluctant to lend, and it
took pressure from the Fed to compel them to supply credit to
traders and other Wall Street professionals who needed emergency
loans.
   ``One of the lessons of two years ago is that it's very
important that ... there be sufficient liquidity to handle whatever
the transactional volume is,'' said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
   Wall Street also will be watching the performance of the dollar
in overseas trading and of the foreign stock exchanges, especially
Tokyo's, which open before New York. The performance of U.S.
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. that trade
in London also could set the tone Monday.
   In Hong Kong on Saturday, the dollar closed slightly lower but
not enough to provide any strong indications of foreign restiveness
about the market drop.
   Gamsin said the New York Stock Exchange late Friday and Saturday
reviewed all of the day's trades and checked the financial status
of its members firms and ``we're very comfortable with the
assessment.''
   A number of safeguards implemented following the 1987 crash
would kick in Monday should the market enter a free fall, Gamsin
said.
   If the Dow drops 250 points from the previous day's close, all
trading would be suspended for one hour. A decline of 150 more
points would trigger an additional two-hour delay.
   On Friday, stock-index futures trading was halted for 30 minutes
twice on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange when the markets in
Chicago had fallen 12 points on the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index,
equal to about 96 points on the Dow.

   Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Gov.
Bob Martinez of Florida, both Republicans, are on a list of nine
anti-abortion politicians named Saturday as the top targets for
defeat next year by a national abortion rights group.
   Emboldened by its successes in Congress and the Florida
legislature last week, the National Abortion Rights Action League
announced its ``NARAL Nine'' list and said it would be involved in
hundreds of races, from the Senate to the state legislatures, next
year.
   ``We will be in high profile campaigns to defeat these
candidates,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
national pro-abortion group.
   ``The NARAL Nine _ and they're just the top tier _ is where
we're going to concentrate our response. This means a heavy
investment,'' she said.
   Michelman announced the list at a briefing for reporters before
the group's national conference in Washington over the weekend.
   The list includes Republican state legislators who have been
particularly vocal and effective in leading anti-abortion efforts
in key states, abortion opponents expected to seek higher office,
and two Democrats the group has identified as opposing abortion
rights.
   One of the Democrats is Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill.
That surprised Connecticut abortion rights activists, who said
O'Neill does not pose a great threat to abortion rights. They are
urging NARAL to take O'Neill off the list.
   ``We don't believe he belongs on our list with Senator Helms,''
said Lynn Blackwell, presient of the board of directors of NARAL's
Connecticut affiliate. ``He is not an active, anti-choice
politician. He's never used his power _ his considerable power _ to
advance his personal opinion on abortion.''
   O'Neill was out of the country Saturday, but his spokesman, Jon
Sandberg, called the listing ``bizarre.''
   Sandberg noted that Connecticut allows Medicaid funding for
abortions, and said O'Neill has not supported failed attempts in
the General Assembly to cut off such funding.
   A Roman Catholic, O'Neill has long stated his personal
opposition to abortion, and voted against abortion rights as a
state legislator in the 1970s. But in nearly a decade as governor,
O'Neill has never pushed for restrictions on abortion.
   On the list:
   _ Stephen Freind, a Republican state representative in
Pennsylvania and leader of anti-abortion forces there. NARAL said
he is sponsoring a bill that would ban abortion after the 24th week
of pregnancy.
   _ Helms, the three-term Republican senator from North Carolina
who has been an outspoken opponent of legalized abortions. So far
only one Democrat, a little-known county prosecutor, has announced
as a candidate to oppose Helms.
   _ Craig James, a Republican congressman from Florida who
narrowly defeated a veteran Democrat in 1988. NARAL had already
targeted him in advertising.
   _ Martinez, the Florida governor whose state legislature
rejected all his proposals for restricting abortion in a special
session he convened last week. His likely opponents include
Democratic Rep. Bill Nelson, who NARAL said has a record of
opposing abortion rights.
   _ Tom Miller, Iowa's Democratic attorney general and candidate
for governor in 1990. Miller is described as a staunch
anti-abortion advocate who faces several pro-choice opponents in
the Democratic primary.
   _ O'Neill, the Democratic governor of Connecticut who faces
several likely opponents.
   _ Kurt Pringle, Republican state representative in California,
who won his first term narrowly in 1988. He is from Orange County.
NARAL said California's legislative elections would be a special
target because anti-abortion forces have a narrow majority in the
state assembly.
   _ Denny Smith, Republican congressman from Oregon, who won
narrowly in 1988.
   _ Tom Tauke, Republican congressman from Iowa, who is an
anti-abortion candidate for the Senate in 1990, opposing Democratic
Sen. Tom Harkin's bid for a second term.
   The group also is involved in the two 1989 races for governor in
New Jersey and Virginia, and on Thursday began airing ads on
Virginia television stations attacking anti-abortion Republican
candidate Marshall Coleman. It was also running ads in more than a
dozen Sunday newspapers.
   Michelman said the group plans to work in 1990 party primary
campaigns in an effort to defeat anti-abortion candidates.
   In Iowa, the group plans to run an independent expenditure
campaign against Miller. In Florida, Michelman said the group would
reassess its involvement in the governor's race if Nelson becomes
the Democratic nominee and he does not embrace a pro-choice
position.

   A 91-year-old woman was hospitalized in stable
condition Saturday after spending 5{ days bound and gagged in her
home without food or water.
   Police found Bessie Johnson on Friday afternoon lying under her
kitchen table, where a thief apparently left her Oct. 7.
   ``They choked her on the bed, wrapped plastic around her neck,''
said police Lt. Edward Kelly. ``She was gagged in the mouth, with a
stocking around her legs, pantyhose around her wrists.''
   The robber stole $17 and a television set, Kelly said.
   Mrs. Johnson, who lives alone in the city's Homewood section,
was taken to St. Francis Health Center suffering dehydration and
bruises.
   The attack left her wrists bruised and blistered, neighbor Relma
Brown said after visting her in the hospital Friday night.
   ``I'm very angry at the person who did this, but she said, `I
kicked him, I kicked him good.''' Mrs. Brown said. ``She is
extremely independent. ... She's in excellent shape for her age.''
   Police and paramedics were called after another neighbor heard
Mrs. Johnson shouting. Mrs. Johnson told police she yelled for help
on several occasions, but was not heard until Friday.

   Gunmen killed an off-duty policeman and
an explosion injured another officer in Medellin on Saturday as
three drug traffickers were extradited to the United States,
authorities said.
   The extraditions brought to four the number of suspected
narcotics figures sent to the United States since the Colombian
government declared war on the cocaine trade in mid-August.
   A homemade bomb exploded Saturday at a national police
installation in Medellin, slightly injuring an officer, said a
spokesman for the city's police. The blast damaged a police vehicle
repair shop and a number of parked cars.
   Hours earlier, unidentified men shot and killed a 29-year-old
off-duty Medellin police officer, the spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
   Since the goverment began its crackdown on the nation's drug
cartels, there have been 162 bombings and police have blamed drug
traffickers. Eleven people have died in the blasts and 184 have
been injured.
   On Friday night, two gunmen killed a broadcast newsman in front
of his home in Monteria, about 300 miles north of Bogota. He was
the fourth journalist assassinated in four days.
   A national police spokesman said 57-year-old William Bendeck
Olivella, the director of a local radio news program, was shot in
the head several times and that his assassins fled on a motorcycle.
   Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported that Bendeck Olivella had
been a ``passionate'' critic of the country's drug traffickers and
guerrilla groups.
   No group claimed responsibility for the killing, but it was the
latest in a series of attacks on journalists, government officials
and judges blamed on drug lords.
   Three media employees were killed Tuesday in Medellin, home of
Colombia's most notorious cocaine cartel. Slain were two employees
of Bogota's El Espectador newspaper and a magazine director.
   A group calling itself the Extraditables, believed to be the
assassination squad for the Medellin cartel, claimed responsibility
for the slayings of the El Espectador workers. In an anonymous
phone call to the paper, a man saying he represented the group said
it would kill the rest of the paper's small staff in the city if
they did not leave within three days.
   El Espectador has been a strong supporter of President Virgilio
Barco's war on narcotics. Colombian drug cartels are believed to
supply up to 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in the United
States.
   Barco announced his war on drugs after the assassination Aug. 18
of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading presidential candidate and
an anti-drug crusader. Barco said he would seize the property of
drug traffickers and extradite reputed narcotics figures to the
United States.
   Drug lords fear extradition to the United States more than
criminal prosecution in Colombia, where the regular killings of
judicial figures have virtually paralyzed the legal system. The
United States has a list of reputed drug figures wanted on
narcotics trafficking charges. The list of the top 12 drug lords
has been made public.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said
the Colombian government extradited Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, Ana
Rodriguez de Tamayo and Roberto Peter Carlini to the United States
on Saturday.
   Ms. Tamayo, 37, was flown into Miami aboard a U.S. government
aircraft and transferred to a federal women's detention center in
suburban Miami for a court appearance by Monday.
   Carlini was to travel to Orlando, Fla., where he faces federal
drug smuggling charges brought earlier this year as well as state
drug smuggling charges issued before that, Runkel said.
   Pelaez Roldan was convicted in absentia in Detroit of federal
drug smuggling charges. He was to be delivered to Detroit.
   The extraditions bring to four the number of people bought to
this country from Colombia since Aug 18, but none is on the U.S.
government's most wanted list. The first, Eduardo Martinez Romero,
was sent to Atlanta Sept. 6 to face money laundering charges.
   Brazilian federal police on Saturday announced the seizure of
450 pounds of pure Colombian cocaine destined for Miami in a
northern Amazon port city, police said.
   Police on Friday found the drugs, with an estimated street value
of $15 million, inside the floor of a twin-engine plane at the
International Airport of Belem, 2,140 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro at the mouth of the Amazon river, police spokesman Myrtes
Pontes said.
   She said from Rio de Janeiro there had been no arrests but that
police were searching for suspects.

   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said Saturday
that a complete opening of Japan's markets would not eliminate the
two countries' financial imbalances.
   She said the United States and other nations also must reduce
their trade barriers.
   Mrs. Hills told reporters her talks with government and business
officials during her first trip to Japan as the U.S. trade
representative were ``quite constructive. ... There have been no
demands.''
   Japanese officials said Mrs. Hills urged Japan to open its
markets wider to U.S. construction companies, satellites and
supercomputers. In response, Post and Telecommunications Minister
Sempachi Oishi told her five of the eight satellites Japan plans to
launch this year are American-made, the officials said.
   Mrs. Hills said she did not discuss rice imports with Japanese
officials. The Japanese government has strongly resisted demands
from U.S. rice producers that it permit imports of the staple grain.
   Mrs. Hills said other nations, including the United States, also
needed to do more to open their markets.
   ``Every market I can think of has protections. If all of those
were to open up, I can guarantee to you we would have a geometric
increase in worldwide prosperity,'' she said.
   She said she did not believe in a heavy-handed response to
Japanese trade barriers under the ``super 301'' clause of the U.S.
Omnibus Trade Act, which provides for punitive actions against
countries that do not practice free trade.
   Mrs. Hills arrived in Tokyo Thursday after a visit to South
Korea and was to leave for home Sunday morning. On Friday, students
in South Korea protested her visit and U.S. trade pressure.

   The launching of the ballistic missile
submarine USS West Virginia on Saturday is proof of the
government's comittment to a strong, battle-ready Navy, said Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Thirteen peace activists were arrested for trying to block the
entrance to the Electric Boat shipyard where the ceremony was held.
The protesters were charged with criminal trespass and released.
   The West Virginia, an Ohio-class sub which costs $1.6 billion,
will be delivered to the Navy next year. It is equipped to fire
Trident missiles.
   Byrd said during the ceremony that anyone ``who might conspire
to disturb world peace or who are foolish enough to attack the
United States or threaten its international interests would be well
advised to take note of today's christening of the West Virginia.''
   But he said, ``if we ever were to launch the missiles of the
West Virginia, our basic goal, to deter war, would have failed.''
   The 560-foot submarine has 24 missile tubes and can carry the
Trident 2 or D-5 missile.
   The West Virginia is the first submarine and the third Navy ship
to bear the name. The others were the cruiser West Virginia, which
in 1920 was renamed the Huntington, and the battleship West
Virginia, which survived the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.

   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain
Saturday called for more global cooperation to fight pollution,
disease and drugs.
   The queen, who arrived Saturday for a state visit just ahead of
the 46-nation Commonwealth summit, spoke at a banquet given by
Malaysian King Sultan Azlan Shah.
   ``Nobody recognizes more clearly than you yourselves that
progress brings penalties as well as its advantages,'' she said,
citing the growth of this former British colony, which gained
independence in 1957.
   ``Pollution, new and terrible diseases, drugs, are all to some
degree the products of progress with which we all have to
struggle,'' the queen said. ``By cooperation and sharing
experiences we can hope to alleviate the consequences of these
scourges of the modern world.''
   Ahmad Kamil Jaafar, secretary general of the Malaysian Foreign
Ministry, said leaders attending the Commonwealth summit will issue
a declaration on how Britain and its former colonies _ which form
the Commonwealth _ should deal with environmental problems. The
summit begins Wednesday and ends Oct. 24.
   Other issues to be discussed include drug abuse and acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Also Saturday, the queen visited a mosque and had tea with
Selangor state Sultan Salahuddin Shah.
   Sunday she was to attend church services, lay a wreath at the
National Monument, visit a home for the elderly and watch horse
racing at the Turf Club.
   She last visited Malaysia in 1972.

   Nearly 500 anti-nuclear protesters, many
with their children in tow, scaled fences around the Seabrook
nuclear power plant Saturday, and police waiting inside arrested
them.
   Protesters brought ladders to help them over the 8-foot fences
that surround the plant. Once inside the plant, the demonstrators
sat down.
   At the busiest of the six points where protesters climbed the
fence, at least 300 people went over _ including two confined to
wheelchairs, many children and at least one infant in a
backpack-carrier.
   Officials estimated 600 to 700 activists took part in the rally.
Police Chief Paul Cronin said 475 people were arrested, including
469 charged with criminal trespass and six with disorderly conduct.
Cronin said the six were accused of jumping in front of buses
carrying protesters to the police station.
   Among the protesters were David Hills, 35, who brought his
6-year-old daughter, Dana.
   ``The point of children coming along is (that) so many people
want to hide their children from what's going on in the world,'' he
said.
   Asked why she came to the demonstration, Dana said, ``Because I
didn't like Seabrook.'' Asked why, she said, ``because people can
die.''
   At a rally earlier, Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, drew cheers.
   ``For the first time, the National Organization for Women
nationally is standing with a group working to end nuclear power in
this country,'' she said.
   ``Today, we petition the powers that be: `Heed the voice of the
people of this country. No nuclear power.'''
   After Yard spoke, protesters marched to the $6.2 billion plant
to post photographs of children on its fence. The theme for the
protest, and others scheduled this week, is ``For Our Children's
Future,'' and many demonstrators brought their children with them.
   Other events set for the coming week include a rally at the
Statehouse on Sunday and concluding with a demonstration at
President Bush's home in Kennebunkport next weekend.
   Saturday's rallies were sponsored by a group called the
Clamshell Alliance, a name that came from the group's concern that
Seabrook's cooling system might accidentally discharge into the
surrounding ocean and harm shellfish on the New Hampshire coast.
   Protests began at Seabrook in 1976, when a lone demonstrator
climbed a weather observation tower. Later that year, 18 people
were arrested as they tried occupy the muddy construction site.
Since then, in mostly peaceful demonstrations, more than 3,200
arrests have been made.
   In 1979 and 1980, a splinter group impatient with the
non-violent civil disobedience practiced by the Clamshell Alliance
ducked behind plywood shields and attacked the plant fences with
bolt cutters, grappling hooks and ladders. Police and National
Guardsmen used riot sticks, tear gas, Mace, fire hoses and dogs to
repel the attacks.
   Since then, authorities have allowed demonstrators to climb
fences before arresting them.
   The plant's foes oppose nuclear power as dangerous and
expensive, and argue that Seabrook is not safe and that the
congested beach tourist area around it could not be evacuated
safely in case of an accident in the summer.
   Plant officials say Seabrook's double-shelled reactor dome makes
it the safest plant around and argue that even if there were an
accident, emergency plans for communities within 10 miles of the
plant are adequate to protect people.
   Seabrook's first reactor was completed in 1986 after its second
reactor was canceled and mothballed while 25 percent finished. It
completed low-power testing in June, despite a valve problem that
cut the test short. The response of plant operators to the
malfunction was criticized in state and federal reviews.
   Now 10 times over budget and 10 years behind schedule, the plant

   A tour bus swerved out of control and flipped
on its side Saturday on a rain-slickened interstate downtown,
injuring all 42 people aboard, officials said.
   The bus overturned around 4 p.m. on the northbound side of
Interstate 15, said Robert Forbuss, president of Mercy Ambulance.
   The 41 passengers and the driver were taken to four hospitals,
Forbuss said. The worst injury reported was a pelvic fracture.
   Scorpio Tours bus driver Jose Luis Figuarera, 51, said in
Spanish through an interpreter that he lost control when he braked
for a car in front of him.
   The bus rolled over on its side, but did not overturn, officials
said. A tractor-trailer rig following the bus swerved out of
control and collided with a car, but no injuries were reported. A
light rain was fallling at the time.
   ``I just saw a lot of cars getting tangled up. Then I saw a
cloud of dust and the bus was in the middle of the cloud of dust
and then it just went over on its side,'' said Clark County
firefighter Malcolm Turner, who was driving home.
   Guests at the nearby Palace Station casino and hotel also saw
the accident, and notified casino security guards, said security
supervisor Sgt. Harold Cook.
   ``I ran out and saw the bus overturned on the highway, about 30
to 35 feet away,'' Cook said. ``People were stopping their cars and
running to the bus.''
   City Fire Department paramedic Gary Pung said, ``A lot of
drivers stopped to help and a lot of the injured were literally
lined up waiting for assistance when ambulances began arriving.''
   Security guards from the U.S. Energy Department's Las Vegas
regional headquarters also helped the injured, paramedics said.

   Lebanon's parliamentary deputies
Saturday narrowed their peace talks to the issue of Syria's
military presence, but one military leader said Christian deputies
could be in trouble if they come home with a bad deal.
   In a statement carried by Christian radio stations in Beirut,
Lebanon, Christian Gen. Michel Aoun called on the deputies not to
``make any commitment that would be viewed as a concession on
sovereignty.''
   ``The Lebanese people will have no mercy on anyone who makes
concessions no matter how important he is,'' Auon said.
   The talks, aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war and
revamping the nation's government, entered their third week in this
mountain resort Saturday.
   Lebanon's Christian-dominated system of government was set up
when the country gained independence from France in 1943. At that
time Christians were in the majority, but now Moslems make up 55
percent of the population.
   Conference sources expressed optimism that the Syrian question
could be resolved if Aoun accepts an Arab League guarantee that the
Syrians will withdraw their 40,000 troops from Lebanon under a
two-year timetable.
   The draft peace plan by Arab League mediators envisages the
phased withdrawal of Syrian troops from metropolitan areas to the
eastern Bekaa Valley.
   The final pullout would be left vaguely tied to the end of the
Israeli military presence in the country and a strong central
government in Beirut that would sign a ``security pact'' with Syria.
   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. However, Aoun says they have lost their
mandate by openly siding with the Moslems in the civil war.
   The meeting of the 63 deputies started Sept. 30. The lawmakers
have announced several times they were on the verge of a peace
settlement, only to be frustrated by renewed demands from one side
or the other.
   Said one source, ``They reach a consensus and then get a
telephone call from Beirut, and we are back where we started.''
   Pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri and Druze warlord
Walid Jumblatt have upped the stakes from Beirut each time Aoun's
hard-line Maronite Christians demanded a quicker Syrian pullout and
written guarantees from the Syrian government in Damascus.
   The Moslems have concentrated on the power-sharing formula the
Arab mediators _ Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria _ have outlined
as a charter for national reconciliation.

   More than 180 people were arrested Saturday at
anti-abortion demonstrations in front of clinics in this city and
Boston, authorities said. Abortion rights activists also rallied in
Boston and Evanston.
   Of about 200 protesters who turned out in Chicago, 116 were
charged with mob action and resisting arrest for blocking the
clinic, said police Cmdr. James Hollandsworth.
   In Boston, 68 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct, and another was charged with assault
and battery on a police officer, said police Superintendent Ronald
X. Conway.
   More than 300 people, including 75 abortion rights activists,
turned out for the demonstration at a clinic across from the Boston
Common.
   In Illinois, abortion is expected to be a key issue during the
state General Assembly's fall session, and a new bid is being made
to settle an abortion lawsuit scheduled to be heard by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``I personally came out because my mother had five children and
one she aborted. I'm glad that one wasn't me,'' said Star Kolesar,
35, of Chicago, who marched in front of the Chicago clinic carrying
a sign that read, ``I was unwanted and abused, yet I love life.''
   Those arrested sat four-deep in front of the clinic's parking
lot and entrance and were carried away by police, Hollandsworth
said. A smaller group of abortion rights activists demonstrated on
the other side of the street, he said.
   In Evanston, two state legislators urged about 200 pro-choice
activists at a rally to write to lawmakers and tell them that the
abortion-rights view is in the mainstream, said David Gallo,
spokesman for state Rep. Woody Bowman.
   ``What the other side tries to tell legislators is that
pro-choice is not the mainstream stance,'' Bowman said. ``This is
not true. They, the other side, are the extremists.''
   In another development, Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan
scheduled a meeting Monday to try to settle a lawsuit involving a
Rockford abortion clinic that is to be heard by the U.S. Supreme
Court on Dec. 5. The clinic has successfully challenged state rules
governing building specificiation for abortion clinics as being
medically unnecessary.

   A Delta Airlines 727 caught fire during a
stop here Saturday, injuring six and leaving a gaping hole in the
aircraft, officials said.
   ``There was a bang, and the stewardess told everyone to exit
through the rear door,'' said passenger Jerome Stumborg of
Bakersfield, Calif. Passengers calmly left the plane via the rear
steps, he said.
   The blaze was quickly extinguished. Five male Delta crew
members, including the first officer, and a male passenger were
treated at hospitals for smoke inhalation, and released, officials
said.
   The fire broke out in a bin housing the Boeing 727's computer
and electronic equipment in the belly of the aircraft below and
behind the cockpit, Fred Rollins, Delta's district marketing
director, said at a briefing. He said investigators were trying to
determine the cause.
   The airplane, which has a seating capacity of 120, had made a
scheduled stop here en route from Los Angeles to Edmonton, Alberta.
Stumborg, who boarded the plane in Los Angeles, said he and about
20 other people were waiting for the aircraft to take on Salt Lake
City passengers shortly after 2 p.m. when smoke started pouring out
of a vent in the first-class section.
   Rollins, however, said only about five passengers and the
plane's crew of seven were on board when the fire broke out.
   Airport firefighters surrounded the aircraft within 90 seconds
of the 2:19 p.m. alarm, and had the fire out 15 minutes later, said
Airport Operations Manager Ron Malin.
   ``We're all very grateful'' it occurred on the ground, Rollins
said.
   The flight was to have left for Edmonton with 86 passengers at
2:42 p.m.
   Bill Goldstone, who was waiting to take the flight home to
Edmonton, said he saw smoke and flames billowing from the plane as
he waited inside the airport near a window.
   Stumborg said no one aboard the aircraft panicked, and praised
the crew for the way it handled the emergency.
   The fire was confined to the first-class section, Malin said. It
left a hole 4 feet wide and melted a substantial portion of the
skin of the front third of the plane, according to Tim Phillips,
the Airport Authority's director of operations.
   There were no indications of any problem during the flight from
Los Angeles, Rollins said.
   Rollins said he did not know the plane's age, but said Delta's
fleet has an average age of 8.4 years. He said the aircraft was
valued at about $30 million.
   Passengers on the Salt Lake-Edmonton flight were rescheduled to
a 4 p.m. flight aboard another Delta aircraft. ``They only had
about a one-hour delay,'' Malin said.
   The fire was being investigated by Delta and the Federal
Aviation Administration.

   Tropical Storm Jerry weakened Saturday as
it moved through the Gulf of Mexico toward Louisiana, and after the
2,000 residents of the state's only inhabited barrier island were
asked to evacuate.
   A hurricane watch had been issued for the coast from the mouth
of the Mississippi River west to Port Arthur, Texas, with the storm
expected to cross over land Sunday at the earliest.
   The watch was downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm watch. The
National Weather Service said the storm had weakened and conditions
remained unfavorable for strengthening in the next day or two.
   The weather service said New Orleans, which had braced for a
direct hit, had received only 1-100th of an inch of rain all day.
Forecasters expected the storm to continue moving north but to turn
toward the northeast Sunday.
   Oil companies continued evacuating the more than 4,000 people
who work on offshore rigs, Texas authorities mobilized emergency
workers and Mississippi officials worried about whether they would
have to postpone a special election Tuesday.
   In Grand Isle, Mayor Andy Valence said he asked residents to
evacuate starting Saturday morning even though the storm's main
effect at the time was good fishing.
   ``People who live fairly near Grand Isle have come down to take
advantage of the great fishing that this disruptive weather brings
about,'' Valence said.
   Traffic appeared normal in both directions on Louisiana Highway
1, the only road connecting the island to the mainland, but Valence
estimated that up to 1,000 people had left by Saturday night. He
said most of the 150 or so boats moored at Grand Isle left Friday
at his request to avoid tie-ups at the highway drawbridge.
   ``With the decreasing of the storm in strength, people here can
be very easily and quickly self-mobilized. So there is no strict
sense of emergency at this time,'' Valence said Saturday night.
   The National Weather Service reported that Jerry had slowed,
with maximum sustained winds down from 70 mph to near 60 mph, and
movement north-northeast at about 7 mph down from 13 mph Friday
night.
   At 9 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was located near 26 degrees
north latitude and 93 degrees west longitude, or about 335 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans, the weather service said.
   ``It's still a fairly strong tropical storm. There's been a
little bit of decrease of convection around the center compared to
yesterday, so it doesn't appear any strengthening is likely,'' said
Frank Rivette, a meteorologist with the weather service in New
Orleans.
   Coastal flooding was a major concern. Because of the way the
Earth, sun and moon are aligned, tides through Friday were expected
to peak at their highest levels in a decade.
   ``It could cause some problems in outlying areas of southeastern
Louisiana, along the coast outside hurricane protection systems,''
said Rivette.
   Up to 1,300 offshore oil workers were ferried in Saturday by
Petroleum Helicopter Inc. helicopters based in Morgan City, said
PHI communications specialist Wayne Firmin.
   ``That's just out of Morgan City, PHI only, today alone. And we
worked all day yesterday doing the same thing,'' he said.
   PHI, one of several helicopter companies servicing offshore oil
rigs, has 13 bases on the Texas and Louisiana coast.
   Elsewhere, emergency preparedness officials took a wait-and-see
attitude.
   ``We just prepare for the worst and hope for the best. But right
now we don't anticipate any serious problems,'' said Morgan City
Mayor Cedric LaFleur.
   ``Our shelters are on standby, and sand and sandbags are on
standby,'' said Ed Comeaux, civil defense director for Iberia
Parish.
   Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus said the state
Election Commission is prepared to meet Monday to decide whether to
postpone a special election to fill the late Rep. Larkin Smith's
seat.
   In Texas, Galveston city and county workers opened emergency
headquarters to coordinate possible storm relief. In Austin,
officials issued statements warning coastal and nearby residents to
beware of possible flooding from high tides and heavy rains.
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.
The storm, which killed 33 in the Caribbean and 29 on the mainland
United States, hit Charleston, S.C., late Sept. 21.
   Tropical storms are named when maximum sustained winds reach 39
mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds hit 74 mph.

   China's most prestigious university opened
Saturday for the first time since soldiers crushed the massive
pro-democracy protests its students helped lead.
   Students gathered to buy books at the center of the Beijing
University campus near a long red banner that urged them to uphold
Marxist principles and take a clear stand against Western
capitalist values.
   Few were willing to talk about the protests that ended in
gunfire and triggered a hard-line backlash in which Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted and thousands were
arrested.
   ``Most students have become more realistic about the situation
and now they want to study,'' said one. But they reported that
among themselves, and on other Beijing campuses, students have
taken to sarcastically singing the jingle from a pesticide
commercial that goes, ``We are the harmful insects.''
   Students were noticeably fewer than usual. The 750-member
freshman class _ down from about 2,100 last year _ will be absent
all year to undergo military and political training at an army
academy outside the capital. Their dormitories were empty.
   Authorities announced after the protests that freshmen for the
first time would spend a year at a military academy, but they
insisted it was not punishment for the pro-democracy protests.
   The reduction in the freshman class was part of a nationwide cut
in first-year students from about 640,000 to 610,000.
   Beijing University has been particularly hard-hit, partly
because it is mainly a liberal arts school and liberal arts are
losing the most new students. The university played a leading role
in the demonstrations, but authorities claim the enrollment
reductions had nothing to do with that.
   The school has an enrollment of about 10,000, but students said
some upperclassmen failed to show up, fearing investigations of
their roles in the protests.
   Other colleges are still continuing such investigations two
months after reopening, with special teams pressuring teachers and
students who were heavily involved to write fuller
``self-criticisms,'' or confessions.
   An official notice posted in several places at Beijing
University said the government would be lenient toward those who
``turn themselves in, confess or render meritorious service'' _
which it explained meant reporting the crimes of others or
providing evidence.
   Other schools reopened early, in August, to complete the spring
semester's unfinished work and hold special political ideology
classes. But Beijing University's opening was delayed until after
the Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of Communist Party rule,
apparently for fear its students would disrupt the festivities. The
day passed peacefully.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said Friday that
Beijing University was a ``major disaster zone'' during the
protests.
   It called for strengthening school management, saying that
people with bourgeois liberal, or anti-socialist, views took
advantage of its past free atmosphere.
   ``Bourgeois liberals will always try by hook or by crook to
meddle in Beijing University'' because of its tradition as China's
most prestigious school, it warned.
   But university President Wu Shuqing, a Marxist economist who
replaced the relatively liberal Ding Shisun after the protests,
said in an interview last week that he was confident the students
would be ``more healthy'' this year.
   ``The university will help the students to understand how to
advance the nation's economic and political reforms according to
China's actual problems and sticking to a socialist orientation,''
he said.
   Wu said the school's goal was to train students to be both ``red
and expert.''
   Beijing University traditionally has led other schools in
political activism, dating back to its leadership in the 1919 ``May
Fourth Movement,'' a student-led protest movement against German
concessions.
   Although most students in Beijing and other cities have
predicted there will be no big protests this year, there have
already been individual acts of defiance. One student at a
technical college wrote ``Down with (Premier) Li Peng'' on a
blackboard. He was tracked down and arrested.

   A federal grand jury charged the crew of a
ship that was carrying a record six tons of cocaine when the Coast
Guard boarded it in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 2.
   A woman and eight men were charged Friday with possessing
cocaine with intent to distribute it. Conviction could bring up to
life in prison because of the amount of cocaine involved, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike McMahon.
   He said the crew could be charged later with importing cocaine
if papers found on the 185-foot Zedom Sea indicate the drug was
destined for the United States.
   The 12,000 pounds was the largest maritime cocaine seizure by
American authorities, the Coast Guard said.
   The ship, flying under a Panamanian flag, was seized in the gulf
several miles off the Yucatan coast of Mexico. The ship's papers
said it was heading to Tampico, Mexico, but Coast Guard officials
said the course did not appear to be in that direction
   The crew is in federal custody in New Orleans, held without bond.

   A pilot landed on a mowed hayfield he

then crashed his plane as he took off.
   Pilot George R. Kern and his passenger, Donnie Spencer, walked
away uninjured Friday from the wreckage of the single-engine Cessna.
   Kern was about a mile away from a grass airstrip outside Yates
Center in southeastern Kansas when he touched down in the hayfield,

   ``He went to a farmhouse, asked where he was at and tried to
take off again,'' said Woodson County Deputy Sheriff Howard Kahler.
   A wing clipped a pine tree as Kern took off, and the plane spun
around and crashed into shallow water near the edge of a reservoir,
Kahler said.
   After the crash, Kern went to farmhouse to call authorities,
Kahler said.

   Six San Francisco Giants' fans swam 12
miles across San Francisco Bay to the opening game of the World
Series on Saturday, and were greeted with boos from followers of
the Oakland Athletics.
   Swimmer Tim Callahan and his friends climbed out of the water
near the Oakland Coliseum after swimming from the Embarcadero's
Ferry Building _ a trip that took four hours and 54 minutes.
   Callahan and his friends, who also swam the English Channel last
summer, got the idea from San Francisco newspaper columnist Herb
Caen, who recently suggested that if a Bay Bridge World Series
developed, it was inevitable that some wacky Giants fans would
stroke their way to Candlestick Park.
   Swimmer Mike Webb said the group from San Francisco's Dolphin
Club decided to do even better _ make a 12-mile watery jaunt all
the way across the bay.
   ``The wind was a little cold,'' he said. ``We called the water
warm; a lot of people would call it freezing.''
   A couple of boats were on hand to take them back to safer,
friendlier territory. All in all, Callahan said the experience was
``easy, fun.''
   The series marks the first time since 1956 that two teams in the
same metropolitan area have clashed in a World Series and the
meeting has been dubbed ``The Bridge Series'' for the span that
connects the two cities.

<TEXT>
   A man arrested by the FBI Saturday for passing
information to the Soviets told The Washington Post he is a former
Marine and Air Force communications officer who tried to fool the
KGB.
   Frank Arnold Nesbitt, 44, was arrested at a hotel in suburban
Washington. He was charged with communication and delivery and the
attempt to communicate and deliver unauthorized information to
agents of the Soviet government, the FBI said in a brief statement.
No other details were released.
   But Nesbitt, in a lengthy interview with The Washington Post
published in Sunday's editions, said he did not tell Soviet agents
anything useful and informed the FBI of his dealings with the KGB
soon after he left Moscow earlier this year. He said he wanted to
be a double agent for the U.S. government.
   The Post said Nesbitt approached the paper Friday because he was
unhappy with the response he received from the FBI after he offered
his services as a spy following a return from an 11-day stay in
Moscow.
   Nesbitt was being held in the Alexandria, Va., Adult Detention
Center pending a preliminary hearing Monday.
   He told the newspaper he left his family and a computer job in
Memphis in June to go to Central America, where he wanted to buy
small parcels of land. The paper said Nesbitt's story could not be
independently verified.
   That didn't work out, Nesbitt told the paper, so he went to
Guatemala City and then Bolivia in August where he met a Soviet
official traveling with a Russian ballet group.
   The meeting, which Nesbitt said was ``purely happenstance,''
ultimately led to Nesbitt's trip to Moscow, where he said the KGB
tried to recruit him for espionage.
   He said when he arrived in Moscow, he was paired with a KGB
colonel who identified himself only as Vladimir and kept in a
``safe house'' about two miles from the Kremlin.
   For most of his 11-day stay, Nesbitt told the paper, he and
Vladimir reviewed his experience in the U.S. military and defense
communications. He said most of the information he provided to the
Soviets was at least 25 years old.
   He said he was initially paid $2,000. He said he gave the FBI
$1,300 and showed the Post an FBI receipt for it.
   Nesbitt said the Soviets asked him to funnel nuclear weapons
secrets out of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico,
where he said he could have been helpful in locating what the
Soviets implied was an agent already operating at the facility.
   Nesbitt said he had a top secret clearance while serving as a
communications officer in the Air Force from 1963 to 1966 and in
the Marines from 1969 to 1979.
   While working at Los Alamos during 1983 and 1984, Nesbitt said
he held a non-classified post until right before he left, when he
was given a top security clearance. Nesbitt, who said he never had
access to government secrets, said he worked at Los Alamos less
than a year and left after a personality conflict with a supervisor.
   Nesbitt said he contacted U.S. authorities as soon as he arrived
back in Guatemala and FBI officials met his plane when he returned
to Washington Oct. 3.
   Nesbitt said he had been detained by the FBI at a Washington
hotel since Oct. 3. He said he left that hotel Friday and went to
The Post to tell his story. The hotel room where Nesbitt was
staying Saturday when he was arrested was a room rented by a Post
reporter for the interview, the newspaper said.

   American scupltor Martin Puryear won
the top prize Saturday at the 20th Sao Paulo Bienal, considered one
of the world's most important international art shows.
   The prize for the country with the best group of art works went
to France.
   Works by more than 150 artists from 42 countries will be on
display through Dec. 10 at the exhibition, which opened Saturday
and is held every two years.
   Puryear, of Chicago, was named the best artist. His exhibit is
comprised of eight large sculptures of different shapes and
patterns made of cedar, steel wire mesh, tar, oak, rattan and
rawhide.
   Jacques Leenhardt, director of the International Art and
Sculpture Center in Paris and one of the five judges, said
Puryear's work ``points to a new direction in sculpture. His work
is abstract, yet at the same time it allows the viewer to interact
with it and create his own images.''
   Puryear was also chosen because of his ``innovative use of
materials that come from primitive cultures,'' Leenhardt said.
   Puryear would only say, ``I am just overwhelmed for myself and
all the people who supported me.''
   He and the French delegation received bronze replicas of an
abstract scuplture by the late Brazilian artist Victor Brecheret.
   The French exhibition contains the works of four artists: Alain
Jacquet, Antonio Semeraro, Jay Chiat and Edouard Merino.
   Leenhardt praised the French work for ``artistic coherence,
quality and diversification and because as a whole they form a good
illustration of contemporary art.''
   The other judges were: Kynaston McShine, senior curator of New
York City's Museum of Modern Art; Guillermo Whitelow, a member of
Argentina's Art Critics Association; Carlos von Schmidt,
international curator of the 20th Sao Paulo Bienal; and Takeshi
Kanasawa, curator of Japan's Hara Museum.

   The largest Shumard oak tree in the
nation, more than 155 feet tall, was felled during Hurricane Hugo,
national park officials said.
   When last measured in 1983, the tree was 155 feet tall, 20 feet
in circumference and had a crown of 116 feet, said Bob McDaniel,
superintendent of the Congaree Swamp National Monument outside
Columbia, where the tree was located.
   The tree, estimated at 140 to 165 years old, was registered with
the American Forestry Association as the largest of its type in the
country.
   The Shumard oak, one of 24 oak species found in South Carolina,
is distinguished by its rough bark and elongated nut.
   An Overcup oak in the Congaree Swamp listed as the
second-largest of its species in the nation also was felled by the
storm, McDaniel said. It was 123 feet tall, 22 feet in
circumference and had a 48-foot crown.
   The timber industry in South Carolina lost 4.4 million acres of
trees totaling $1.04 billion in the Sept. 21 hurricane.

   The largest pumpkin grown in the United States this
year is spending its final days basking in the Miami sun before
going under the knife.
   ``Then we turn it into the world's largest jack-o'-lantern,''
said Kevin Winkler of Slick's Farmer's Market, which plans to
donate the 641-pound monster to Children's Hospital in Miami.
   Winkler said the market has been buying record pumpkins for 25
years. The latest prize, grown by Edward Gancarz of Wrightstown,
N.J., cost $1,500.
   The pumpkin measures 50 inches high with a circumference of 158
inches, said Winkler. Also on display this year is a 165-pound
watermelon.
   The New Jersey pumpkin was only the third-largest in an
international competition this year, said Susan Battillo at the
World Pumpkin Federation in Collins, N.Y.
   A 755-pound pumpkin grown by Gordon Thomson of Hemmingford,
Quebec, broke a 6-year-old world record of 671 pounds held by
Gancarz's brother Robert. The runner-up was Bernard Levary's
710-pound entry grown in Pontyclun, Wales.

   More than 433 miles of fishing line,
14 dead sea turtles and trash from 40 nations turned up on Florida
beaches during a coastal cleanup, a conservation group reported.
   The results of the Sept. 23 litter-bashing effort so appalled
some officials they have decided to send a letter to local
governments urging them to do more to stop littering.
   ``I was pretty discouraged and disgusted with the things we
picked up,'' said Jan Platt, a Hillsborough County Commissioner who
chairs the Agency on Bay Management.
   The statewide cleanup attracted 14,000 volunteers who bagged and
labeled more than 200 tons of trash, said Heidi Lovett of the
non-profit Center for Marine Conservation, which organizes three
such cleanups a year.
   Litter from 39 foreign countries, including Mexico, the Soviet
Union and Germany, was collected. Officials say the trash probably
was dumped overboard by foreign vessels and swept by ocean currents
to Florida.

   Four Pan American World Airways ticket agents at
Kennedy International Airport were arrested Friday and charged with
stealing up to $48,000 from the airline.
   The four agents were charged with falsifying records and
larceny, said Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
   The agents allegedly sold one-way tickets and kept the cash
payments instead of placing the money in the register, Cahill said.
   The four are charged with stealing up to $48,000 in August and
September, although Port Authority detectives believe the agents
may have been keeping the cash payments for about a year, he said.
   The investigation, conducted at the request of the airline, will
continue and more arrests are expected, Cahill said.
   The agents were identified as Ellen Lass, 23, Lilana Ruiz, 28,
and Devarn Williams, 26, all of New York City; and Cathy Alam, 37,
of Copiague.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is
reassuring the nation the largest decline in the stock market since
the 1987 crash will not hurt the real economy that provides
Americans with jobs and stable prices.
   ``The outlook is good for continued moderate growth,'' said
Brady, who issued a statement two hours after the market closed

   He was the only senior government official to comment on the
stunning almost 191-point drop of the Dow Jones industrial average.

   Congress and President Bush are facing two
impending budget struggles following Senate passage of a $14
billion deficit-reduction bill that was stripped clean of billions
of dollars of spending items and tax breaks.
   The chamber's 87-7 passage of the fiscal 1990 deficit-cutting
legislation late Friday set the stage for what could be difficult
negotiations between the Senate and House on a compromise version
of the bill.
   Unless Bush signs the compromise into law by Monday _ impossible
because House members are away for the weekend _ $16 billion in
defense and domestic spending cuts will take effect that day. The
fiscal year began Oct. 1.
   The deal worked out between Democratic and Republican leaders
also left the bill minus a capital gains tax cut that has been a
priority for Bush, putting off that partisan showdown.

   East Germany reportedly will allow hundreds more
refugees to leave for the West and has freed most pro-democracy
demonstrators, although Communist leader Erich Honecker rejected
talks on reform with the opposition.
   Party sources and Western analysts speculated the 77-year-old
Honecker's downfall could come soon, although no official word has
surfaced of a possible leadership change.
   Since July, about 50,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany
and at least 70,000 others have emigrated or refused to return
after being allowed to visit West Germany. Most refugees complained
that demands for reform and greater democracy got nowhere in
Honecker's hard-line regime.
   East Germany conceded Friday that the exodus has cut
significantly into its labor force.

   President Bush says he still wants Panamanian
ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power but that doesn't mean
he's giving a ``carte blanche'' for use of U.S. military troops to
help remove him.
   Bush, continuing to defend his decision not to intervene in the
failed coup attempt by Panamanian military officers last week,
said, ``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in a
prudent manner.''
   But, he said, ``I hope I would never be reckless enough as a
commander in chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force
without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt.''
   He called complaints that he should have used military power to
back up his repeated calls for Panamanians to oust Noriega ``a
stupid argument that some very erudite people make.''

   Even before it goes into day-to-day use in mid-1990, the Federal

   The verdict's in from experts who dug up the
common grave of five Colorado gold prospectors to see who did them
in and ate them up: Alferd Packer was the murderer with an appetite
for his victims.
   ``Guilty as sin,'' intoned James E. Starrs, a professor of law
and forensic science who led an expedition to Lake City, Colo., to
show what experts in archeology, anthropology, pathology and
firearms could learn about misdeeds committed 115 years ago.
   Starrs said Friday the bones provided scientific evidence that
prove Packer ``beyond the shadow of a doubt'' murdered his
colleagues, marooned in the Rocky Mountains during the murderous
winter of 1874, and ate their flesh to stay alive.
   Packer, accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1974, was
convicted of murder in 1883 and of five charges of manslaughter
three years later when the first conviction was overturned on a
technicality.

   Preceded by ``here-come-de-judge'' jokes and
headlines about viewer juries, CNN's new ``The World Today''
premieres tonight, co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and former Texas
judge Catherine Crier.
   It will be a closely watched event. It's Crier's debut in news.
And it marks a direct CNN push, if only in half the nation, against
the ``CBS Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC
Nightly News.''
   Crier, 34, had no experience at all as a journalist when hired
by Cable News Network, whose action startled many in news. She only
has had two weeks on the job at CNN. Shaw, with CNN since it began
in 1979, is a 25-year veteran in news who came up the hard,
traditional way.
   Although he has declined to comment, he reportedly was more than
a little miffed at her hiring. Crier says she knows nothing of
that: ``That's not the message I've been receiving. And I've been
working with him.''
   She meant rehearsals of the new show. Crier, who will co-anchor
it at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, with Shaw co-anchoring in
Washington, is aware that a certain amount of criticism may follow
her on-air debut tonight.
   ``I'm not as worried about that initial round as I will be six
months or a year down the road'' if criticism continues, she says.
``Because I am brand new to the business, and I acknowledge that,
and have a lot to learn.''
   She doubtless will be the nation's most watched on-the-job
trainee. But CNN's new one-hour weeknight newscast, starting at 6
p.m. EDT, isn't likely to make a big dent in ratings of the Big
Three for several reasons.
   The major networks twice ``feed'' their half-hour weeknight
newscasts to affiliates, the first feed at 6:30 p.m. EDT. West
Coast affiliates air those newscasts three hours later on a
tape-delay basis.
   In contrast, ``The World Today'' will air live simultaneously in
all time zones, with no tape delays for the West Coast. Thus, its
head-on competition with the Big Three only will be in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Its potential audience also is smaller because only it only is
on cable. CNN estimates it is seen in 52 million homes. That's
impressive, but there are a total of 92.1 million homes with TV,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.
   Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering,
downplays the idea of the newcomer representing major competition
to the Big Three.
   ``In the cable world, I don't know that you say you're going to
make a dent in (Nielsen) numbers,'' he says. ``You hope to. But you
look for the kind of audience that's most desirable to sponsors _
some of the better-educated, more affluent viewers ... and we have
a pretty good market for that.''
   NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, referring to shares of audience for
programs, says that the new CNN rival is ``just one more
demonstration that every year, that pie out there is getting sliced
into that many more pieces.''
   But he says he's not certain whether ``The World Today'' is a
potential ratings threat to his newscast and those of CBS and ABC.
   He admires both CNN and Shaw _ ``I don't know anything about
that woman,'' he adds, referring to Crier. But ``my impression
always is that CNN's greatest strengths always have been as a kind
of random viewing place,'' he says.
   ``I don't know if people look for specific programs (there). I
guess that'' _ CNN's new newscast _ ``will be the test for them,
and for us, as well.''

   NBC, continuing its recent tradition of uplifting entertainment,
tonight airs another steamy tale of tawdry. It is ``Roxanne: The
Prize Pulitzer,'' which is set amid the rich in Palm Beach, Fla.,
and lasts for two hours.
   Based on the book of the same name by Roxanne Pulitzer, it
dramatizes her sad story, how her fairy-tale romance with and
marriage to publishing heir Herbert Pulitzer collapsed amid a
flurry of headlines about cocaine, trumpets, and sexual capers that
included one menage-a-trois.
   What to say of this movie? First, it is only her version of what
happened, the latter noted on the screen at the end, no doubt for
legal reasons. It is lushly filmed, and Roxanne mainly is depicted
as an innocent, vulnerable, misused waif.
   But Chynna Phillips is very, very good as poor, poor Roxanne.
One wishes she had a better script. One also wishes that Perry
King, given a one-dimensional part as the man who married the fair
young Roxanne, had hair color that stayed the same.
   Although only a passage of several years is involved here, his
locks are mostly silver in some scenes. In other scenes, the heir's
hair is mostly dark brown with a dab of gray.
   This drama may raise anew the debate over colorization, but it
is one that can be missed with no regrets.

   The news stunned some stock analysts who had
aniticipated earnings of about $50 million for the quarter. Too
high, suggested a Chrysler executive, ``I doubt we did much better
than break even.''
   There could very well be more shocks of that sort in coming
months, since the stock market has tended to ignore a deterioration
of corporate earnings that began early in the second quarter of the
year.
   The longer term trend is there to be examined, but many
investors appear to ignore it. Meanwhile, their sense of well-being
is secured by reports from many companies showing that, in spite of
a sluggish economy, they are doing well.
   On the day Robert Miller Jr., Chrysler chief financial officer,
estimated negatively on his company's third-quarter earnings,
Coca-Cola reported a 20.9 percent earnings surge and General
Electric a jump of 16 percent.
   Glittering reports of that sort, especially from two of
America's premier companies, are bound to attract the attention of
those who pray for a rising market. But they also obscure the
condition of the majority of corporations.
   For the latter, earnings have lost a lot of momentum. In 1988,
profits of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's composite index rose
36 percent. The rate fell to 22 percent (over the prior year) in
the first quarter of 1989. In the second quarter, the
year-over-year rise declined to under 5 percent.
   Those rates still leave corporate America making a profit, but
the trend is clear. It is especially clear in certain categories
such as aerospace, apparel, automotive, electronics, metals,
oil-gas and recreation.
   And some well-known companies suffered not just declines in the
upward progress of their profits, but actual losses. In
electronics, for example, Wang reported a loss of $375 million and
Control Data a loss of $497 million.
   Such numbers usually are sufficient to call investor attention
to a problem, and they have. But the concern seems limited to the
specific companies more than to the industry, and to the industry
rather than to the whole market.
   The stock market is believed by many to be a good economic
forecaster, the premise being that investors aren't inclined to
needlessly risk their capital, and so wouldn't be investing if the
next six months or so didn't look good.
   True, you can find few forecasters with arguments that support a
sizable downturn in the economy, but there also are few who foresee
a big increase over 1989. There are many who believe gains in
corporate profits will be small.
   DRI-McGraw-Hill, whose economic projections are used by many
companies, expects after-tax profits to be down sharply in the
first two quarters, based on comparisons with the same quarters a
year earlier.
   Thereafter, it expects an upward trend right through 1991. But
not until the second quarter of that year _ 18 months from now _
does it foresee the level of profits achieved early this year.
   As the stock market plays tag with new highs, therefore, the
pressing question it presents for your consideration is this: Is it
looking six months ahead _ or perhaps two years? Or is it perhaps
confused?

   They starred in the '70s and stumbled in the
'80s. Now Wall Street seems to be warming up again toward energy
stocks as the 1990s approach.
   ``The oil industry's long dry spell appears to be ending,''
declares the Merrill Lynch Market Letter in its current issue.
   ``We think it is giving way to an uptrend that will see all the
major facets of the business _ exploration and production
activities as well as refining and marketing operations _ do well
simultaneously in the years ahead.''
   At another large investment firm, Dean Witter Reynolds, analyst
John Connolly says: ``At long last energy fundamentals look decent.
We now believe this group can significantly influence the success
or failure of a portfolio.''
   Connolly, like many another market-watcher, had been
recommending that investment managers keep their energy holdings
well below the proportionate weight the group carries in the
popular indexes of stock prices.
   Now, he says, ``we have canceled our deep underweighting and
opted, for the first time in years, for a slightly overweighted
position.''
   Even the most ardent energy bulls don't expect investors
suddenly to rush into a sector of the market that has produced so
many disappointments for so long.
   But they do foresee at least a gradual recognition of what they
describe as brightening prospects for both energy demand and energy
prices.
   ``The demand for oil has increased since 1985 and now is more
than 51 million barrels a day, a level last seen 10 years ago,''
Merrill Lynch says.
   ``We think demand will increase at an average annual rate of 1
million barrels a day over the next few years and that prices will
trend higher, especially if supplies from countries that are not
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries begin
to decline.''
   Ah yes, OPEC _ the powerful cartel that was supposed to keep
pushing oil prices higher and higher for the indefinite future
after the energy shocks of the 1970s in the industrialized world.
   When market conditions got tough, it turned out there were some
deep cracks behind that group's supposedly united front.
   But now, Connolly argues, OPEC's leading members have maneuvered
themselves into a position where only a few of them need to
practice restraint in their production policies to tip the balance
of supply and demand in their favor.
   Furthermore, he adds, ``the most significant development in the
next few years will be a pronounced output decline by the world's
largest producer, the Soviet Union.''
   Along with improving business conditions, analysts say, might
come revived takeover interest in energy companies. Says Merrill
Lynch, ``higher valuations for refining and marketing facilities
have boosted the asset values of many oil companies.''
   Despite all such arguments, many skeptics remain. Investors
trying to spot a rebound in the oil industry's fortunes have been
frustrated repeatedly since the mid-1980s.
   In his report on the subject, Connolly says he was not an easy
convert to the cause.
   ``We have hesitated to commit to the energy area all year,'' he
says. ``In fact, we have hesitated for several years now, proving
that he who hesitates is not always lost.''

   The Siberian villager led an American
interviewer into his home and, safely out of view of his neighbors,
started talking about freedom in the Altai Mountains far from
Moscow.
   ``This is the only place in the whole world where a person can
feel himself being free, can feel himself being original, to be
himself, to be his own person,'' he said in Russian. ``That is the
Altai spirit and that is what I'm proud of.''
   But Soviet authorities, like the invading armies that have swept
through southern Siberia since the 8th century B.C., now are
encroaching upon his lifestyle: electricity, a day care facility,
television.
   That revealing bit of glasnost (openness) appears near the end
of ``Hard Labor in Siberia,'' a documentary that premieres Monday
on the Discovery Channel. It was one of many unexpected events an
American river-running team encountered in Siberia in August 1988.
   ``That did surprise us,'' the program's writer-director, John
Armstrong, recalled in a recent interview. The Altai villager,
Armstrong said, had been reluctant to speak initially for fear his
neighbors would think he was an informant. Then he opened up on his
government.
   ``He was saying we are the freest people in the world, we have
the freest spirit, and he's proud of it, and he doesn't like the
Soviet Union. He doesn't like them coming in and meddling,''
Armstrong said.
   The villager also had his own views about America.
   ``He just cracked us up when he said `This is the Miami of the
Soviet Union.' To him Miami meant freedom,'' Armstrong added.
   Despite its title, there are no Soviet gulags in ``Hard Labor in
Siberia.'' The labor was in navigating the Bashkaus River, an angry
ribbon of water that surges through the Altai Mountains.
   The film documents the first attempt by a Western group to
traverse the Bashkaus, said to be one of the toughest stretches of
whitewater in the world.
   As an adventure film, ``Hard Labor in Siberia'' packs a wallop.
But Armstrong clearly is interested in more than just man against
nature; he also pits the Western notion of lock-step communist
states against the reality of the independent Altai people and the
three outspoken Soviet river runners who led the trip.
   ``They were just like us, just in terms of the way they
related,'' Armstrong said of the Soviet boaters. ``They could care
less about what their government was saying. In fact, they were
even suspicious of (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev,''
Armstrong said.
   The film is a constant clash of opposites: frenzied water
bashing immovable rocks; big-city Soviets confronting agrarian
Siberians; high-tech U.S. equipment vs. low-tech but inventive
Soviet hardware; and ``can do'' Americans challenged by cautious
Russian bureaucrats.
   The expedition began badly. The Soviet organizers,
Sovintersport, were unsure of the abilities of their Western
visitors and suddenly decided they should do a less dangerous river.
   But once Sovintersport authorities were out of sight, the
Americans persuaded their Soviet guides that they were capable of
tackling the Bashkaus.
   ``The Soviets aren't geared up for tourists running their rivers
in the first place,'' Armstrong said. ``They thought (the Bashkaus)
would be too dangerous _ they didn't know what we were capable of
handling and they didn't want any bodies on their hands.''
   A Soviet river runner had died on the Bashkaus just a few days
earlier, bringing the death count to seven since the river first
was run in 1977.
   An American raft nearly sank when it became wedged in rocks, and
the American kayakers often looked to be in danger of being
swallowed by heart-stopping vortices of water.
   The Soviets were adept with their catamaran-like boats that had
two inflated canvas pontoons joined by tubing and birchbark straps.
The Soviets balanced astride the pontoons bronc-busting style.
   A final surprise awaited the expedition at the end of their
journey: a Soviet film crew was in the Altai village shooting a
gold robbery ``Western'' based on a Jack London short story.
   And even in this remote corner of the world, the Soviet film
makers traveled in style _ with a sauna.

   One recent night, Liza Minnelli and her husband,
sculptor Mark Gero, went out to dinner with a friend. When they got
home, the friend telephoned with a question for the singer.
   ``Have you ever had a hit record?'' asked Gene Simmons, formerly
of Kiss.
   ``No,'' came Minnelli's response.
   People think she has, Minnelli says, but ``New York, New York''
was a hit for Frank Sinatra, and ``Cabaret'' was a hit for Louis
Armstrong. ``It was way before I did the movie; I was doing
`Charlie Bubbles' at the time, the first movie I did, with Albert
Finney.''
   Simmons, who obviously didn't phone just to flatter, continued,
``How did you get so far in your career without a hit record?''
   ``Hard work _ going around singing and building an audience. And
it's 1:30 in the morning. You got something in mind?''
   Simmons did. He thought she should sing ``today'' music and he
should represent Minnelli in her recording career, which he now
does. He introduced her to CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff,
who signed her to Epic Records. The Pet Shop Boys' manager happened
to see the signing memo and suggested they produce a couple of
tracks on her album. A meeting was arranged.
   So, while singers from Linda Ronstadt to Steve Miller switch on
albums from rock to standard ballads, Minnelli is going the other
way and trying out rock. ``Results'' is her first album in 12 years
that isn't a Broadway cast album or a live concert.
   She had heard ``West End Girls'' by the Pet Shop Boys. ``I
started to buy their albums. The song that hooked me was `Rent.' It
was this strange, beautiful little song, so bittersweet and ironic.
It was almost like a Noel Coward lyric.''
   The first song the Pet Shop Boys (Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant)
brought to her, she recalled in a recent interview, was ``Losing my
Mind,'' from Stephen Sondheim's score for ``Follies.'' As they
worked on recording it, they found out Minnelli knew more about
rock than they'd expected, and she discovered they knew a lot about
the Rodgers and Hart era.
   ``They found out I wasn't going to try and pretend like I knew
more than I do or boss them around or be demanding,'' she said.
``All I wanted was to do it well and learn from them because I
adore them. Four days later they called and said, `We want to do
the whole album.''' The Pet Shop Boys wrote seven of the 10 songs.
   ``I kept saying, `I want to do your music.' They said, `You've
got to leave us open if we find something that's good for you.' I
said, `It's up to you completely.'''
   There's a dance beat, which Minnelli calls ``heartbeats,'' on
the tune.
   ``I sing it with anger,'' she said. ``It's different from
singing it as blues but just as valid. Obsession runs many courses
and a lot of layers. After you get sad and sorry for yourself, you
probably get angry. I do.''
   ``Losing My Mind'' already is a hit in Europe. She'd been busy
with concerts, Broadway, TV and films and hadn't been yearning for
a hit record. But when the album shipped gold in England, ``I was
like the `new artist of the week.' It was hilarious. It was
wonderful.'' The album was released in the United States on Tuesday.
   The Pet Shop Boys didn't want Minnelli to change her emotive
singing style and stopped her once for a retake when she pronounced
love ``luv'' as she thought a rock singer should.
   ``I had such fun working with them,'' Minnelli said, ``just the
three of us in this little tiny recording studio.'' They cut the
album with Minnelli singing eight songs to completed tracks.
``Rent'' and ``Tonight Is Forever'' were cut live, with strings.
``It's the first time they'd done that. They were so amazed. The
musicians play, I sing and we go to dinner.''
   They worked 10 days. Four more sessions were done later while
she was in London during her four-month tour with Frank Sinatra and
Sammy Davis Jr.
   ``We'd sing in Royal Albert Hall and I'd come off stage and say,
`Bye, guys, I'm going across town and work with the Pet Shop Boys.'
'' Some nights they went along and listened.
   ``I was going between two different styles of music. What it
showed me the most is how alike they are,'' she said.
   ``As a dancer and somebody who moves to music, the Pet Shop
Boys' tracks are so interesting. On top of that you have this
almost floating, almost Gregorian melody and very poetic words. I'm
passionate about lyrics.''
   ``Don't Drop Bombs,'' which is a story about a relationship, not
a war, will be the second single, and ``So Sorry, I Said,'' about a
woman who realizes she shouldn't be so self-deprecating, will be
the third.
   ``Twist in my Sobriety'' isn't about drinking. ``A girl is
talking to a guy, saying, `You're a little left turn in my
straight-ahead life and that's all you can be. Don't get too
serious.'
   ``Tanita Tikaram wrote it and performed it almost like a
folksong. We do the psychotic version of it,'' Minnelli said.
   ``We were listening to the playback and Chris said, `Wouldn't it
be funny if we said Liza with a Z on this, like a rap.' Neil said,
`That should be heard. Half the people who buy this record won't
have heard that.' I was amazed that they knew it.'' They were
referring to Minnelli's 1971 TV special, ``Liza With a Z.''
   In her only reference to mastering substance abuse, Minnelli
cheerfully said she doesn't know what her next show-biz project
will be. ``I don't know and I love it. It kind of goes with my
one-day-at-a-time life.''

<HEAD>Dustin Hoffman's Shylock Prepares for Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dustin Hoffman's Shylock on the London stage is
now a memory, leaving a legacy of mixed reviews, packed houses and
great expectations for Broadway, where he opens in December.
   Sir Peter Hall's production of Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of
Venice'' was the lone smash hit in an otherwise lackluster summer
for British drama. It opened June 1 at the Phoenix Theater for a
13-week run that was extended through Sept. 23.
   Hoffman as Shylock was a risky venture. It wasn't just a
question of ironing the New York inflections out of Hoffman's
voice, but of how the fastidious British theater-going public would
take to a Hollywood star attempting Shakespeare.
   ``I didn't quite know what it would be like. All I knew is I
would learn something,'' Hoffman said.
   Explaining the mixed reviews, he blamed the speed with which the
production was rushed onto the stage, due to his father's illness,
which forced him to spend time at his bedside in the United States.
   ``We opened in this play after 10 public performances, and my
performance for me was like those incisions you see from people
who've been operated on,'' he said in an August interview.
   ``You still see their fresh wounds and their stitches; now I'm
at a point where you can barely see the scars.''
   Shylock is the Jewish moneylender whose thirst for revenge
against Antonio (Leigh Lawson), the Venetian merchant of the title,
finds its match in the exactingly legalistic heiress, Portia
(Geraldine James).
   Hall, who directed the play, said that as an authentically
Jewish actor, Hoffman ``changed the part historically.''
   ```Merchant' seemed to me particularly right for him,'' Hall
said in an interview. ``Shylock is about the outsider, the man
coming into the society which he is foreign to, which was very much
Dustin's situation coming into an English theater company.''
   Assessing Hoffman's achievement toward the end of the London
run, Hall said: ``Shylock is wheeling and dealing and surviving,
and that's what Dustin seizes hold of. To me, he answers the
question, is Shylock comic or tragic, by saying he's both; he's a
man.''
   The Shylock character traditionally provokes the accusation that
Shakespeare was anti-Semitic, and anyone involved in staging ``The
Merchant of Venice'' knows how sensitively it must be handled.
   ``To have a Jewish actor play Shylock is mandatory in our age,''
said Hall. ``If you're going to talk about Jewishness, you'd better
do it from a position of integrity and knowledge, not ham acting.''
   Some of the play's success may have been due to renewed
enthusiasm for Shakespeare. But the real draw undoubtedly was
Hoffman, fresh from his second Academy Award for ``Rain Man,'' in a
play that marked both his British and his Shakespearean stage debut.
   Hoffman, who grew a beard for the show and shaved it off after
the last performance, eschewed above-the-title billing and appeared
half way down the cast list.
   But despite such modesty, the mixed reviews and a top ticket
price of 17.50 pounds ($28), expensive by London standards, the
play quickly sold out. Only the London mega-musicals such as
``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Aspects of Love'' sold as many
tickets.
   The play starts New York performances Dec. 4 at the 46th St.
Theater, with an opening on Dec. 19.
   Hall recalled that Hoffman first thought of playing Hamlet, but
was judged too old at 52. Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night,'' another
possibility, was shelved for want of a suitable Viola. The two then
hit on Shylock, one of Shakespeare's most controversial parts and
also surprisingly small in light of its importance. Shylock appears
in only five scenes.
   A planned out-of-town tryout in Bath was canceled because of
Hoffman's father's illness, and Hoffman's performance had to evolve
during the run. The opening, said co-star Geraldine James, was
``very rushed.''
   ``Dustin hit his peak in the middle of the run,'' she said in an
interview. ``He hadn't got the confidence at the beginning ... and
I think he might have gone too much the other way (towards the
end), playing too much into the audience.''
   She said she found his attitude anything but starry. ``He was so
generous, spiritually and literally; he wouldn't have his name over
the title and insisted on me having the last curtain call.''
   Julia Wilson-Dickson, the production's dialogue coach, admired
Hoffman as ``a fanatical worker, a seeker after the truth ... but
perhaps a little more free in his enthusiasm'' than most British
actors.
   It fell to her to turn his ``dawg'' into ``dog,'' and ``bawnd''
into ``bond,'' and his performance over time got ``simpler, more
straightforward, and physically stronger vocally,'' she said in an
interview.
   ``The actual conception of it is exactly the same, but the
practical delivery has been honed greatly.''
   Could Hoffman tackle other Shakespeare parts? ``Absolutely,''
Wilson-Dickson said. ``I've told him so about 50 times _ and he's
definitely humble enough to ask.''

<HEAD>Virginia Candidates Shun Campaign's Potential to Make History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder forced a frown
and gave his audience of college students a parody of the questions
he and Republican J. Marshall Coleman have heard dozens of times in
their campaign for governor.
   ``Can it really be taking place here in Virginia?'' Wilder
asked, his voice mocking the astonished tones of an outsider. ``Are
they really going to do that there? What sort of poison have they
poured in the water down there? What are those people drinking?''
   Wilder, the state's 58-year-old lieutenant governor, and
Coleman, a 47-year-old former attorney general, are deadlocked in
polls on the state's most expensive battle for governor _ $20
million and growing.
   If Wilder wins on Nov. 7, he would become the first black
elected governor of any state.
   Yet strikingly, in a campaign that has captured national
attention because a black man is vying for the top office in the
flagship of the Confederacy, both candidates have avoided more than
passing mention of race. The chief issues have been abortion and
crime.
   Nonetheless, race has had a major impact on the campaign, says
Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia government professor _ it's
just been the opposite of what was expected.
   ``Clearly, Wilder's race is a net plus for him,'' Sabato said.
``It gets him loads of free and favorable national publicity. It
produces national money. It insulates him from many charges.
   ``And it's a status symbol for upper- and middle-class suburban
whites to vote for him. It's objective proof that they're not
racist,'' the professor said.
   Coleman says Virginians see the contest ``just as two candidates
running for office.'' Standing in the shadows of the Blue Ridge
Mountains where he spent his youth, he said Wilder wants to take
the state back ``to the days of higher taxes, high interest rates
and high inflation.''
   Wilder also portrays Coleman as a ``turn the clock back''
candidate who wants to return to the time when abortions were
illegal and progress was measured by the bulldozers of big-money
real estate developers.
   To get where they are, both candidates have beaten the odds.
   Wilder became Virginia's first black statewide officeholder and
the highest-ranking elected state official of his race in the
country when he won the No. 2 office in 1985. That was after 16
years in the Virginia Senate, where he was the first black since
Reconstruction.
   Coleman was the only Republican to become attorney general this
century and, when he won the post in 1977 at age 34, its youngest
occupant ever. After he lost the 1981 race for governor to Democrat
Charles S. Robb, Coleman was written off by his party, but he
scored a comeback by winning the state's first GOP gubernatorial
primary in 40 years.
   The current governor, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, is barred by
the state Constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.
   A Richmond Times-Dispatch poll published Oct. 1 found 42 percent
for Wilder and 40 percent for Coleman, with the remainder
undecided. The poll's margin of error was four percentage points
either way.
   Partly because of the primary, the campaign has passed $20
million in fund-raising. Coleman has pulled in $8.2 million _ more
than a third of it from real estate developers in fast-growing
northern Virginia, a point that Wilder has used against him _ to
Wilder's $4.8 million. But Coleman spent much of his war chest in
the primary. As of Oct. 1, Wilder had $1.6 million in the bank to
Coleman's $925,000.
   Wilder, who is expected to get nearly all of the approximately
17 percent black vote in the state, has tried hard not to alienate
moderate whites, who gave Democrats the top state offices in the
last two elections while voting solidly for Republicans Ronald
Reagan and George Bush.
   When a Labor Day college fraternity gathering of 100,000 black
youths in Virginia Beach erupted into riots, he refused to join
other black leaders who accused the resort city's leaders of being
hostile to minority visitors.
   Coleman has said he will not concede the black vote and will not
let Wilder use race as a shield to hide behind what Coleman calls a
liberal voting record.
   Wilder has made Coleman's anti-abortion views the focus of a
television ad and has pressed the GOP contender on whether he would
sign legislation restricting abortions. He also says Coleman, whose
support from evangelical conservatives helped him win the primary,
would make abortion a litmus test for appointees, a charge Coleman
denies.
   ``He has been seeking to exploit a very emotional issue and to
distort my record,'' Coleman said in a televised debate last week.
``I think that issue now should be put to rest.''
   Last week, Coleman countered with his own TV commercial
depicting Wilder as insensitive to women for having introduced a
bill in 1972 that would have allowed defense attorneys to
interrogate rape victims 13 and under about their sex lives. Wilder
press secretary Laura F. Dillard said Wilder submitted the bill for
a constituent and did not support it or vote for it.
   Coleman has tried to make Wilder appear soft on crime by
resurrecting a 12-year-old vote against a ``cop killer'' death
penalty bill. The Republican has also played up his endorsement by
the state's Fraternal Order of Police, an endorsement Wilder won in
1985. Wilder said he supports Virginia's capital punishment law.
   The only black governor in U.S. history was Pinckney B.S.
Pinchback of Louisiana. He became lieutenant governor in 1871 and
moved up to the post of acting governor for six weeks in 1872-1873
after the governor was impeached.
   In recent years, major parties have nominated two black
politicans for governorships. In 1982 and 1986, Los Angeles Mayor
Thomas Bradley ran as California's Democratic candidate for
governor, losing both times to Republican George Deukmejian. In
1986, Michigan Republican William Lucas failed to unseat Democratic
Gov. James J. Blanchard.

   High-flying takeover stocks made a hard landing
in the stock market plunge that followed the news that a planned
$6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp. was in jeopardy.
   Wall Street fled from takeover issues Friday as stocks plunged.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 190.58 points to 2,569.26
after the pilot-management group planning to buy United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. said it could not get financing for the deal.
   Among the hardest hit were companies involved in takeover fights
and some that have already won their battles. Traders have grown
increasingly uneasy since highly-leveraged deals such as Campeau
Corp.'s buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Merv
Griffin's purchase of Resorts International Inc. have run into
trouble.
   UAL shares were down $5.50 to $279.75 when news of the buyout
problems led to a halt in trading of the airline's stock late in
the session. Trading never resumed and UAL escaped a further
pounding.
   One of the biggest casualties was Time Warner Inc., which is in
the process of completing its $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc. Time Warner skidded $11.25 a share to $131.75,
while Warner dropped $5.12{ to $61.50 a share.
   Traders abandoned Time Warner because of the company's enormous
debt load. Time Warner will carry $13.6 billion in debt after it
completes the Warner acquisition.
   Paramount Communications Inc., which has been in the market for
an acquisition ever since it failed to take over Time Warner's
predecessor, Time Inc., also slumped badly. Paramount fell $6.62{
to $56.62{ a share.
   AMR Corp., facing a possible $7 billion takeover bid from
developer Donald Trump, slipped 12{ cents from Thursday's close to
finish at $98.62{ a share, but that was down $4.62{ from its high
of the day, $103.25, reached at midmorning.
   Trading in AMR _ the parent of American Airlines _ also was
halted shortly before the market began its plunge. The New York
Stock Exchange reported an order imbalance in the airline's shares
that likely was caused by heavy selling _ AMR was the 15th most
active issue on the exchange with more than 1.8 million shares
changing hands.
   LIN Broadcasting Corp., the target of an unwanted bid from McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc., was off $5.50 to $107.50, while McCaw
fell $3.50 to $40 a share.
   USX Corp. retreated $4.37{ a share to $33 after having bounded
higher last week on speculation that investor Carl Icahn would
force a restructuring of the steel and energy company or even bid
for it.
   Takeover stocks have helped carry Wall Street higher for months.
But a string of deals have turned bad lately and raised many
uncertainties in the market.
   Campeau's announcement last month that it was unable to make
interest payments on the junk bonds it used to finance its buyouts
of Federated and Allied Stores Corp. caused heavy losses among
those risky high-yield debt securities.
   Campeau, trying to juggle $11.5 billion in debt, has been forced
to put its prize Bloomingdale's store chain up for sale and to
engage in other restructuring.
   Resorts International is trying to renegotiate its $900 million
in debt after the company was also unable to make interest
payments. Analysts have said entertainer Merv Griffin paid too much
for the company when he bought it last year from Trump.
   And earlier this week, Ramada Inc. said it was forced to
postpone its planned $400 million restructuring because of
unfavorable conditions in the junk-bond market. Ramada also was hit
hard Friday, skidding $1.75 to $9.50 a share, or more than 15
percent of its value.
