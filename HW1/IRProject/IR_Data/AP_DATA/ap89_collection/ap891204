   A year after an earthquake smashed
northwestern Armenia into rubble, the city of Leninakan is a
shantytown of mud and memories.
   The Garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket
on a tiny wood stove. The stove also heats a makeshift cabin they
built from remains of their former apartment building next door.
   Far above, rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on
the fourth floor, which was exposed when the side of the building
sheared off.
   ``We're afraid of living in a large building again,'' Meruzhan
Garapetyan said.
   Popular songs speak of the disaster of Dec. 7, 1988, when an
earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale killed at least
25,000 people and destroyed the homes of 500,000 more.
   ``Oh earthquake, what have you done?'' one asks. ``Why did you
leave so many parents without their children? ... You covered them
with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears.''
   The Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 people still are
missing, 2,000 of them children. Daily life is slogging through
mud, relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return.
   A quake of 7.1 magnitude in the San Francisco area on Oct. 17
killed only 66 people. Damage was estimated at $7 billion, but much
of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks.
   In Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city, Vartan Oganisyan
and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet
metal, wood scraps, tar paper and salvaged window frames.
   Other families crowd into half-shattered buildings, construction
huts, army tents, round Mongolian yurts, abandoned railway cars and
even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows. A few open
cooking fires can be seen in the twilight.
   Electrical power is intermittent as Armenia enters the bitter
Soviet winter.
   Children bundle up for classes in temporary, unheated buildings.
They wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at
the slightest noise.
   After school they play ``earthquake,'' recreating the disaster
in the muddy streets.
   Hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work. Many
graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave.
   Sofik Torunyan, who lost both children, was there on what would
have been her daughter's 20th birthday, with a cake fashioned from
carnations.
   ``Oh, my young daughter! Oh, my love!'' she wailed, holding onto
a friend. ``Why didn't I die, too, so I would not have to live
without you?''
   People struggle on, helping each other. Hospitality and pride
remain.
   A dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that
still works. A boy paints the window frame in his family's shack.
Visitors are offered coffee and sweets, but often there is no
electricity to boil water.
   Maria Tumanyan, who lives in the ground floor of a severely
cracked five-story building, insists that ``we're making great
progress.'' She concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of
broken concrete and twisted metal, not the rubble remaining.
   The town of Spitak was leveled. Kirovakan and 300 villages were
shattered.
   In Leninakan, which had 235,000 residents, the quake destroyed
99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools and every factory,
officials said.
   Reconstruction has lagged badly. Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the Soviet
premier, said in November that the crash program to rebuild in two
years already was a year behind schedule, meaning virtually nothing
had been accomplished.
   Residents blame disorganization, central planning's failure to
supply enough building materials and a two-month blockade of
Armenia by ethnic enemies in neighboring Azerbaijan.
   Many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because
supply shipments were held up on rail lines in Azerbaijan.
   By early November, only three new buildings had been completed,
all by the army for the army.
   Karlin Ambartsumyan, chairman of the city Communist Party
committee, still hopes to move 4,000 families into a vast new
suburb before year's end, but even that would be only one-fifth as
many as planned.
   For now, Ambartsumyan is concentrating on getting the remaining
homeless among the 190,000 people now living in Leninakan into
construction huts and other temporary housing, and getting heat for
them before winter.
   Svetlana Asaturyan lives in one such hut, generously called a
``little house'' in Russian but in reality a two-room insulated
packing crate.
   She and her family of five must haul water from a block away,
use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relative's place for
showers. Her washing flaps over a sea of mud.
   Mrs. Asaturyan is grateful, however, because they used to be in
the remains of the towel factory where she once worked, and where
30 of her co-workers were killed.
   Her ``little house,'' like thousands of others, showed up
without a door, window glass, heater, wiring or furniture. It was
vandalized en route, apparently by Azerbaijanis, whom the Armenians
accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies.
   When asked about the Soviet leadership's promise to rebuild in
two years, Mrs. Asaturyan said: ``I'll be glad if I get a home
within five years.''
   About 20,000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments
in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months. A
forest of 129 cranes towers over the site, and buildings faced with
local salmon-colored stone gleam in the sun.
   Because nine-story apartment blocks shoddily built of pre-formed
concrete panels collapsed in the quake, the new buildings are made
by assembling vault-like precast rooms, foreman Gennady Pogosov
said. None is more than four stories high.
   In May, a commission of the ruling Politburo blamed most of the
deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors.
No charges have been filed, said Haik Minasyan, an Armenian
government spokesman.
   Only a few projects are under way in the city itself. On the
central square, a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin looks over a scene of
devastation: a ruined school, department store, government
building, post office, shops and a sock factory.
   Cafes and movie theaters are gone. So are most food stores, and
shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and
potatoes at what remains of the bus station.
   Ambartsumyan said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half
the original city lots because the ground is too unstable.

   Fighting intensified Tuesday between
rebels and loyal forces in the Makati financial district, where
about 2,000 foreigners, including more than 200 Americans, have
been trapped in hotels for four days.
   Efforts to evacuate foreigners held by the rebels appeared to
have stalled early Tuesday.
   A 60mm mortar round slammed into a squatter settlement near the
Makati Medical Center about 6 a.m. (5 p.m. EST Monday). Ten people
were taken to the hospital, including a 6-year-old girl who died.
   Two bombs exploded in the capital late Monday, wounding two
people. It was unclear if they were related to the coup attempt,
which began Friday and has killed at least 71 people and wounded
more than 500.
   The U.S. Embassy recommended Tuesday morning that Americans
living in Makati remain in their homes but avoid upper floors, lest
they become targets for snipers.
   At least three people were killed in Makati on Monday and 15,
including one American, were wounded by sniper fire and shells.
   Troops loyal to the government of President Corazon Aquino,
backed by three armored personnel carriers, began moving under
cover of fire toward the hotel district where the foreigners are.
   ``Are we going to win?'' a colonel asked his men at the end of a
briefing. ``Yes, sir!'' they shouted.
   He told his men not to fire unless they had a rebel in their
sights.
   The Japanese Embassy recommended that Japanese citizens living
in parts of the posh Makati district not under rebel control leave
for safer areas of Manila. It estimated 500 Japanese remained in
Makati, including about 300 trapped in the hotels.
   A statement telephoned to news organizations from a rebel
spokesman, Capt. Albert Yen, said the insurgents would release the
foreigners to dispel suspicions they were being held hostage.
   The statement said the foreigners would be free to leave the
hotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday and would be taken to Manila's airport
aboard shuttle buses.
   Yen said the move did not indicate the rebels were about to end
their bid to oust Mrs. Aquino.
   ``That's the farthest thing that we could do,'' he said. ``We
pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the last
drop of our blood.''
   About 400 mutineers from the elite Scout Rangers were holding 22
buildings in the Makati district, where many foreign embassies and
residences of foreign diplomats and businessmen lie.
   About 400 rebels continued to occupy Mactan Air Base in Cebu,
350 miles south of Manila. Their leader refused to surrender and
threatened to blow up the base's planes.
   President Bush called Mrs. Aquino on arriving back in Washington
from the Malta superpower summit and following a visit with NATO
allies in Belgium to express concern for the lives of Americans in
the Makati hotels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted Bush as telling
Mrs. Aquino: ```I understand some Americans are in the hotels. .. .
Can we get those people out? I'm very concerned about their lives
and their safety.'''
   ``She assured him they were doing everything possible to protect
American lives,'' Fitzwater said. ``Then the president ended the
conversation by saying, `I appreciate your concern for the
civilians. We're proud of you for standing up with great courage.
We want to see you succeed.'''
   The United States provided fresh military supplies to the Aquino
government and promised $25,000 in help for civilian hospitals,
said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   The Japanese are planning to send three tons of emergency aid,
including food, water and medicine to its embassy, said a foreign
ministry official in Tokyo.
   Filipino Tourism Undersecretary Rafael Alunan prepared about 20
buses to go into the battle zone and evacuate tourists to the
airport. Alunan broadcast a statement over Manila radio stations
telling the rebels the routes the buses would take and that each
would carry a white flag.
   As the first buses prepared to enter the area, heavy firing
broke out. Officials stopped the buses in order to contact rebel
leaders by telephone to make sure the deal was still on. Officials
planned first to evacuate guests from the Intercontinental Hotel
and if the operation was successful to clear out other buildings.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said 215 Americans were
believed in three hotels in Makati.
   Hospital sources identified the American wounded Monday as
Jerome Weissburg. They said he was hit in the arm by glass when a
bullet shattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel.
They did not know his hometown.
   The Manila Chronicle quoted military reports as saying nine U.S.
servicemen from Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila, were
among the trapped Americans.
   Loyal forces said the rebels were contained in 22 buildings in
Makati.
   Snipers exchanged fire through the night.
   Barbara Julich, a New York businesswoman trapped in the
Intercontinental Hotel, was contacted by telephone and said,
``Literally, we're in the middle. (We're) now low on food. There
are babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and the
mothers are hysterical.''
   The city's international airport reopened Monday but domestic
air service was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed but
government employees were ordered to return to work except in the
Makati area.
   Officials reported shortages of food and fuel.
   An explosion Monday rocked the compound of the Central Bank, the
equivalent of the Federal Reserve. There were no injuries. A second
bomb went off in the Ermita entertainment district, damaging an
unoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two women were injured
by flying glass.
   Monday morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in Makati _
members of the army's First Scout Ranger Regiment _ refused appeals
to surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approached
their strongholds.
   The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. Aquino, swept to power in a
1986 military-civilian uprising that toppled President Ferdinand
Marcos, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist
insurgency and economic problems. This is the sixth and most
serious attempt to overthrow her.
   One of the coup leaders is Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a
cashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. Aquino but
later led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained at
large.

   His family hasn't seen Araik Sukasyan
since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago, but they
speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a Moscow
psychic can tell them where.
   ``We wait to find him alive,'' said his mother, Galine, weeping
as she pulled out Araik's school portrait. She hopes publicity will
bring word from someone who has taken him in, if that happened.
   The fourth grader vanished in the rubble of School No. 9 along
with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit Leninakan
during school hours Dec. 7, 1988.
   Authorities say it killed 25,000 people, but the Armenian relief
agency Search says 20,000 more still are missing, including 2,000
children.
   ``They are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of
those evacuated,'' said Ashot Georgyan, director of the Search
office in Yerevan, capital of Soviet Armenia. He said he had no way
of knowing how many of the 20,000 were dead and how many were just
separated from their families.
   ``We are now continuing the search for children, particularly
orphans, who were sent in groups to various points in the Soviet
Union and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts,'' Georgyan
said.
   Many parents, like the Sukasyans, believe officials may have
lost track of some evacuees.
   Larissa Vagashakovna, head of the Moscow office of Search, said
she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the
missing children.
   ``It's impossible to forget the faces of these parents,'' she
said. ``They haven't found the corpse and they haven't found the
child. Where have they disappeared to?''
   Araik's sister, Narina, also was in School No. 9 when it
crumpled. She escaped, and when her mother came running from home,
Narina cried: ``Momma, I am alive, but I can't find my brother!''
   For a month after the earthquake, the Sukasyan family watched
workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been School No.
9.
   Searchers found the bodies, or identifiable parts of bodies, of
420 students and 26 teachers. There was no sign of 100 others,
including Araik.
   ``There were people where they found only one leg, and
identified the shoe or the skirt, and they buried that,'' said Lida
Grigoryan, a teacher at another school and a friend of the family.
   The Sukasyans searched hospitals, opened every one of thousands
of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in
Yerevan and Moscow.
   They found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that
someone took him away.
   ``In Moscow, there is a woman who can see where someone is by
looking at his picture. We hope she can help,'' Araik's mother
said. Then she was worried again, because reports say the psychic's
powers only work with an original photograph.
   ``This is a copy,'' she said, staring at her son's young,
serious face.

   How do hard-working, mature University of
Cincinnati law students relax after a hard day of studying for
final exams?
   ``The favorite is Play-Doh,'' law library secretary Carol Moore
said Monday. ``We go through a lot of Play-Doh. They say it's
really relaxing.''
   The colorful modeling clay is in the law library's toy room, an
area stocked with marbles, puzzles, board games and Far Side
cartoon books, as well as coffee and food.
   It began three years ago and re-opened Wednesday in the
library's Urban Morgan Human Rights room for the school's 2{-week
final examination period.
   ``It's just really to relieve tension and stress,'' Ms. Moore
said. ``It's a chance to do something besides study and hit the law
books.''
   Playing Battleship or marbles in the toy room was often the only
relief for students who studied as much as 20 hours a day for final
exams, said Kim Holling, who graduated from the law school last
year.
   ``After you study all day, there's just a point where you can't
study any more and can't absorb any more,'' she said. ``This sounds
pretty childish, but we did those things.''
   The toy room was the idea of law librarian Taylor Fitchett, who
started similar toy rooms at the University of Alabama and Tulane
University, Ms. Moore said.
   ``She said to me the second year she was here, `I think we
should have a play room for the students,' and I said, `Just what
am I supposed to do?''' Ms. Moore said. ``She said we should get
some puzzles and coloring books, and I said, `Are you serious?'''
   Ms. Fitchett was out of town Monday and unavailable for comment.
   Ms. Moore said the library hasn't heard any complaints about the
toy room.
   But she said one problem can be how the Play-Doh is used. She
said the colorful modeling clay was used after the Cincinnati
Bengals' victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday to modify a
statue of President William H. Taft, a graduate of the school.
   ``I came into the library this morning and he had on a Bengals'
helmet, and I said, `Oh, no,''' she said.
   Ms. Moore said the library plans to keep the toy room open only
during test periods, despite students' pleas.
   ``They'd like us to have it all year long, but it's too much of
a mess,'' she said.

   It's the laugh. That obnoxious giggle
that ends in a full-fledged snort. That's the mark of true nerd.
   Jeremy Kahn has it. Naturally. He is the founder, president and
ideological spokesman for the newly formed Society of Nerds and
Geeks _ or SONG _ at Harvard University.
   If ``Veritas'' (truth) is the motto of Harvard and ``Vanitas''
is the motto of the Harvard Lampoon, then the slogan of SONG is
``Veritas is more important than Vanitas,'' explained Kahn, 20, a
junior majoring in math.
   ``The kind of people we're looking for are very interested in
what they're studying. Not as worried about _ like _ what other
people think about them,'' said Kahn who punctuates his sentences
with ``like'' a lot.
   ``Truth is more important than to look good,'' he added.
   Everyone knows or has known a nerd or a geek. A nerd was that
brainy math major in college, the one with the thick glasses, the
perpetual pocket calculator and plaid shirt. The geek is the guy _
or gal _ who wore mismatched socks or strange color combinations
and walked to the beat of a drummer no one else heard.
   Nerds, however, go on to invent amazing new machines and make
millions on the patents. Geeks go on to found new companies and
become the CEO featured on Fortune's cover for maverick style.
Nerds and geeks always have the last laugh.
   Will nerds inherit the earth? No, but they might just save it,
according to Kahn.
   The first step, he says, is to help take the stigma off students
who live to study, not party. SONG, organized in mid-October by
Kahn, aims to do that with meetings, speakers and other activities.
``Basically it's putting academics ahead of social life.''
   With about 35 members, SONG meets weekly and fosters discussions
on how to study better and improve academic standings.
   ``We talk about _ like _ why grades are important to us or how
we see relationships, which may seem strange for nerds and geeks to
talk about,'' said Kahn. And he laughed that nerdy laugh.
   Future plans for SONG include lectures, off-beat dances for
those slightly out of step and a special ``procrastination hot
line.'' This would involve a ``kind, caring and generous
counselor'' to talk with students who simply can't get down to work.
   ``I think students procrastinate more than anyone else. It's
amazing how much time I spend procrastinating,'' Kahn said. A hot
line could get students ``on the road to recovery. In 10 minutes
they'd be sitting down and getting to work.''
   Kahn had been thinking about organizing some kind of club since
he entered Harvard. ``Freshman year I found myself very isolated.
For the first time in my life I could not concentrate on studies.
No organization that would, like, help me concentrate on studies.''
   So he thought up the name Society of Nerds and Geeks, registered
it with the proper Harvard authorities and began having meetings.
Most members are math majors, but other disciplines are represented
as well, such as Sanskrit.
   The club's graduate student adviser Leonid Fridman has written a
``Nerd Manifesto'' about the dangers of anti-intellectualism. Yet
the alumni adviser is the assistant coach of the Harvard wrestling
team, demonstrating that nerds and jocks aren't necessarily
mutually exclusive.
   ``The role of women in SONG isn't any different from that of
men. We are equal opportunity nerds,'' said freshman Kate Tulenko,
an 18-year-old biochemistry major.
   There's a funny saying going around Harvard, ``Blessed are the
nerds and geeks for they will become trendsetters,'' Kahn said. And
then he laughed like nerd.

   A showdown between three
Pentecostal ministers and a prosecutor over the confidentiality of
a burglary suspect's confession in church ended when the man
pleaded guilty to grand larceny.
   Larry Yost, who was to have gone on trial today, entered the
plea Monday under an agreement reached at a hearing before Morgan
County Circuit Judge Thomas Steptoe. Yost, 35, had been charged
with the more serious crime of breaking and entering.
   ``It's over with,'' said a jubilant Rev. Shirley Hiles. ``We
don't have to testify, nor do we have to refuse to testify.''
   Yost's hearing came after Steptoe refused for the second time to
excuse Mrs. Hiles, 51; her husband, the Rev. Jack Hiles, the
58-year-old founder and pastor of the Word of Deliverance
Association; and the Rev. Wilda Maconaughey from subpoenas issued
by county Prosecutor Charles Trump IV.
   Yost, a Berkeley Springs carpenter who has been held at the
Eastern Regional Jail in lieu of $15,000 bond since January, was
sentenced to a year in the county jail, with credit for time served.
   ``I'm happy, the whole church is happy,'' Yost said in a
telephone interview from jail. ``I didn't want to see the ministers
go to jail. And I should be out in a month if everything goes
right.''
   Last December, a sobbing Yost interrupted a service at the
church, confessing that he didn't try to stop the break-in at his
uncle's building supply store.
   The ministers had said Trump wanted them to testify at Yost's
trial, and maintained authorities had crossed the boundary between
God's work and their own.
   Steptoe first refused to block the subpoenas Nov. 15, ruling
that state law does not protect confessions made to clergy. The
state Supreme Court last week refused to hear the ministers'
challenge.
   West Virginia and New Hampshire are the only states that do not
protect confessions made to ministers or priests in criminal cases,
said Richard Gay, the ministers' lawyer. West Virginia, however,
does allow statements made to clergy about divorce proceedings to
be kept secret, Gay said.
   Yost said earlier that just before Christmas he told the
congregation that he watched and did nothing as another man broke
into his uncle's store last December. He denied having a role in
the robbery.
   ``It was such a burden on my heart, I just had to go to my
church and get it off my chest,'' Yost said.
   Gay said another attorney has contacted him about drafting
legislation to protect clergy and penitents in similar situations.
   ``I was disappointed the Supreme Court didn't take this
opportunity to examine the issue,'' he said. ``It's a fundamental
issue that cries out to be heard.''
   The U.S. Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Gay also
argued that the state constitution prohibits anyone from being
subpoenaed, jailed or arrested based upon a religious belief.
   The importance of protecting confessions made to clergy has been
recognized since the days of the Roman Empire, according to the
Rev. James Burtchaell, a Roman Catholic professor of theology at
the University of Notre Dame.
   ``Society has said that it is of paramount importance that
people be able to confide in clergymen or attorneys or their
doctors without fear of it being disclosed,'' said Burtchaell, who
has taught a course preparing seminarians to hear confessions.
   However, Burtchaell added that the ministers' case may have been
weakened because Yost gave his confession publicly.
   Public confession of sins is a basic tenet of the Pentacostal
church. ``Jesus never took anyone aside and had them confess their
sins in private,'' Mrs. Hiles said.
   Hiles said the church's jail ministry had been hurt since
inmates heard of the subpoenas.
   ``They don't know if they can trust us anymore,'' Hiles said.
``They're saying `Why should I tell you anything? If I do, they
might force you to say it in court.'''

   An 8-year-old girl whose life was cut short

to school.
   In a 90-minute service at a funeral home, Eliana Martinez was
eulogized as a frail, innocent child barely 3 feet tall who never
learned to speak but taught adults the language of love.
   ``Eliana taught us to hug and to kiss,'' said her mother, Rosa.
``She takes a part of me with her.''
   At Myrtle Hill Cemetery, the mentally disabled girl's small,
white casket was opened and Mrs. Martinez kissed her adopted
daughter goodbye.
   Mourners released balloons into the air, and the casket was
lowered into the ground. Friends were invited to throw of colored
beads into the grave along with the traditional handfuls of dirt.
   Strands of the colorful glass beads which Eliana liked had been
placed around her neck, and her Raggedy Ann doll laid on her chest.
She was in a white dress with blue ribbons.
   The funeral home was decorated with small balloons. Larger red
and purple balloons adorned the four white limousines that carried
relatives and friends on the 15-mile procession to the cemetery,
passing Eliana's school, school board offices and the courthouse.
   More than 125 people who gathered at the funeral home watched a
slide show that showed the wide-eyed smiling girl at home, the
beach, school, the county fair _ and the hospital.
   Playing in the background was ``Everybody's Child,'' a song
composed by family friend Linda Castellano.
   Kenneth Thomas told mourners that Eliana was ``a little girl
with a gigantic heart (who) taught us so many things _ love,
respect.''
   Speech therapist Dan McClowrey said Eliana did not learn to
speak, but ``spoke so loud to all those who were willing to hear.''
   ``She showed me that loving is all there is,'' he said, his
voice breaking. ``It was interesting to meet someone who turned the
tables on me.''
   Mrs. Martinez adopted Eliana, who died a week ago, when she was
11 months old after hearing a radio appeal for a sickly child
abandoned in a hospital in Puerto Rico.
   Four years later, the family learned that Eliana had acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. By the time she was four months old,
Eliana had received 38 transfusions, and doctors believed she
received tainted blood.
   Education officials tried to restrict Eliana's instruction to
her home, fearing she might transmit AIDS to other pupils. Mrs.
Martinez sued, saying the child needed contact with other children
to develop.
   A federal judge said the child could attend classes only if she
sat inside a specially-built glass booth until she was toilet
trained and stopped sucking her fingers. Mrs. Martinez appealed and
won after a two-year battle.
   Eliana went to school this year, but became too ill to continue
after three weeks in class.

<HEAD>House Panel May Probe S&amp;L Case Linked to Bush's Son</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, having aired the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, is considering probing an even more politically touchy
case linked to President Bush's family.
   Among the institutions that could be spotlighted next by the
committee are Silverado Savings and Loan Association of Denver,
declared insolvent by regulators in December 1988.
   Neil Bush, the president's son, served on Silverado's board of
directors, resigning just after his father won the Republican
nomination in 1988 and only four months before the S&amp;L's seizure.
   In a drive to oust top thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, Gonzalez
conducted six public hearings this fall focusing on regulators'
delay in acting against the Irvine, Calif.,-based Lincoln, which is
expected to become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a cost to
taxpayers of $2 billion.
   At the last hearing just before Congress recessed for
Thanksgiving, Gonzalez, D-Texas, vowed to continue the probe when
legislators return in January, expanding it to include other
notorious examples of abuse.
   ``We had scores ... of Lincolns and we're going to look into
them. Lincoln is just the first because it was the biggest,'' he
said.
   In response to a question from a reporter, Gonzalez said
Silverado could be among the failures highlighted at a future
hearing. Committee aides have been gathering material on the case.
   Silverado was declared insolvent by thrift regulators on Dec. 9,
1988, and taxpayer costs could run as high as $500 million.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., now part of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., attributed the failure to
``substantial dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of
laws, rules and regulations.''
   According to government sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, regulators are investigating to determine whether to
file a civil suit against Silverado's former officers and
directors, which would include Neil Bush.
   A new investigative book on the S&amp;L crisis, ``Inside Job'' by
Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker and Paul Muolo, cites links between
Neil Bush, a director from 1985 until August 1988, and a major
customer of Silverado.
   Bush's oil and gas company, JNB Exploration, had a $1 million
line of credit at Cherry Creek National Bank, which was owned by
Bill Walters, who received more than $40 million in loans from
Silverado, according to the book.
   Silverado also had business ties to Larry Mizel, a prominent
Republican who raised $1 million for Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign.
   James Moroney, a former analyst for the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Topeka, alleges that regulators held off action against
Silverado because of its political connections, the book says.
   Aides to Gonzalez said no decision has been made about whether
to air the Silverado case in public hearings. The Lincoln sessions
_ even though they targeted Wall, a Republican _ proved more
embarrassing for Democrats because they highlighted the efforts of
five senators, four of them senior Democrats, to intervene with
regulators on Lincoln's behalf.
   The president thus far has praised Gonzalez for his bipartisan
conduct of the hearings and said he has ``not closed the door'' on
ousting Wall. Aides to Wall speculate that Gonzalez may be holding
out the possibility of Silverado hearings as part of his bid to get
rid of the regulator.

   It isn't any noisy, late-night parties at
bachelor John Shumate's home that have his neighbors whispering.
It's what he keeps in his front yard.
   Like the life-size Elvis Presley bust with purple pompadour,
bolted atop a tall pedestal guarded by a grinning, red-bearded
gnome holding a sign reading ``Long Live the King.''
   Or that plastic palm tree festooned with blinking blue lights
that decorated Shumate's front porch last Christmas, opposite a
plastic Santa Claus whose fat belly was illuminated with a flashing
light bulb.
   Passersby also are transfixed by the concrete Venus de Milo and
pink flamingo, the plastic madonna blessing the concrete rabbit,
squirrel and penguin.
   And the little concrete toddler, shyly clutching a teddy bear
and sucking on its fingers while its diapers fall down. It's one of
Shumate's favorites.
   ``It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen,'' he says with
a chuckle. ``It's just awful.''
   Shumate, a 42-year-old architect and avid collector of lawn
ornaments, delights in adorning the yard of his modest bungalow in
this Washington suburb with the sort of truly tasteless schlock
that makes urban sophisticates wince.
   ``I saw this stuff when I was a kid growing up in the
Philadelphia suburbs,'' he said. ``It was humorous to me even then.
What's interesting about the 50s was the junky stuff _ the cars,
the lawn sculptures, the furniture. It's so bad it's good.''
   Shumate had only a few pink flamingos when he bought his
Arlington house three years ago. Perhaps it was the house, with its
original pink aluminum siding from the 1950s, that inspired Shumate
to begin collecting in earnest.
   His favorite haunt is Harper's Lawn Ornaments, a two-acre mecca
for kitsch hunters in rural Harrisonburg, Va. It was there that he
found his $32 Elvis bust among the tons of concrete birdbaths,
Jesus figures, antlered stags and naked ladies.
   ``Things were relatively quiet around here until I put up
Elvis,'' Shumate said. ``It became a landmark overnight. At first
my neighbors didn't know what to think, but they finally figured
out my sense of humor and now they enjoy it.''
   Shumate is a Cadillac freak, too. He's owned six of them. The
latest, parked in his driveway, is a monstrous 1975 model
Fleetwood. Original avocado green paint, wide white sidewalls,
license plates that read ``Gross XS'' (for Gross Excess) and a
``Caution: I Brake For Elvis'' bumper sticker.
   ``I consider that to be one of my lawn sculptures,'' he says.
   Down in his basement, Shumate keeps the trashy stuff he hasn't
decided where to display in the proper mock-serious style,
including a concrete cherub with a large fish draped over its
shoulder and ``your generic babe with a bunch of grapes'' sprayed
with gilt paint.
   On a shelf are air-brushed wall squirrels, a pink coffee mug
with pelican-shaped handle, a blue plastic shark that Shumate once
hung from the rear-view mirror of his old powder-blue Caddy.
   ``This is what yuppies put in their kitchen window as a joke,''
he said disdainfully. ``They have no real commitment to lawn
ornaments. If everyone thinks it's a joke, it doesn't count. It's
not really fun.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev left their weatherblown summit talks offering
visions of a dawning era of lasting peace, with the remnants of the
Cold War giving way to a better world.
   They announced no breakthroughs Sunday on issues that divide
their countries, such as Central America and naval disarmament, but
said that was not the point of their open-agenda dockside
encounters.
   In their parting remarks, both chose to emphasize mutual
aspirations.
   ``We sought the answer to the question where we stand now,''
Gorbachev told reporters. ``Many things that were characteristic of
the Cold War should be abandoned ... the arms race, mistrust,
psychological and ideological struggle and all that. All that
should be things of the past.''
   Trading relaxed banter at the first-ever joint news conference
of Soviet and U.S. presidents, Bush and Gorbachev repeatedly echoed
each other's words as they described their talks and their hopes
for the future.
   ``I couldn't have asked for a better result out of this
non-summit summit,'' Bush said. ``It was a no-agenda meeting and
yet it was a meeting where were discussed, as the chairman said,
many, many subjects. So I think if a meeting can improve relations,
I think this one has.''
   The next chance comes in June, when a full-scale Bush-Gorbachev
summit is scheduled for Washington.
   The fireworks missing in the superpower talks were supplied
Sunday night in a loud and colorful display over the Grand Harbor
of Valletta, the capital of this Mediterranean island nation.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, headed for Moscow to meet with his Warsaw
Pact allies while Bush traveled to Brussels to brief the NATO
allies.
   ``Tonight we stand at the crossroads of history on our way to a
Europe made whole and free,'' Bush said when he arrived in
Brussels. ``Today as the sun broke through the clouds there at
Malta, we could see both a new world taking shape, a new world of
freedom,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he was ``encouraged and inspired'' by the reforms
sweeping Stalin-style communism from Eastern Europe. He said the
changes stem from ``the desire of these peoples to ennoble their
societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up
the rest of the world.''
   And in a post-summit interview broadcast on Soviet television,
he had praise for Bush.
   ``I must say I'm glad I found a lot of realism in Bush's
attitude and I felt his desire, his effort to understand the
processes under way, exchange opinions, to work out approaches,''
Gorbachev said. ``The dialogue actually surpassed my expectations.''
   The weather in Malta was less congenial. What was planned as an
offshore summit alternating between U.S. and Soviet warships never
came off.
   Saturday afternoon's session was canceled when Bush could not
get off the guided-missile cruiser USS Belknap because of 60 mph
winds and high seas.
   The two rounds of talks that did take place were both moved to
the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky, docked at Marsaxlokk Bay
several hundred yards from the naval vessels. Neither leader ever
made it to the missile cruiser Slava, intended to be the Soviet
summit site.
   Gorbachev suggested cutting naval forces on the two sides, but
Bush, whose large-ship navy predominates, said he was ``disinclined
to think that this is an area where we will have immediate
progress.''
   The leaders also restated their positions on Central America _
Bush complained about Nicaraguan and Cuban supplies of Soviet-bloc
weapons to rebels fighting the right-wing government in El
Salvador, while Gorbachev said the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua had given assurances such shipments had stopped.
   ``I don't believe that the Sandinistas have told the truth to
our Soviet friends,'' Bush said.
   U.S. officials said Moscow could benefit from cuts in tariffs on
Soviet exports to the United States and American support for its
participation in the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in exchange for relaxing emigration restrictions on Soviet
Jews.
   The leaders also ordered their officials to speed up
negotiations on treaties to cut conventional arms in Europe and
long-range nuclear weapons in hopes of signing both next year.
   An unprecedented joint news conference at the conclusion of the
summit was not part of the initial plans. It developed when both
leaders stayed to respond to questions after making their
statements, and unfolded in a relaxed, almost teasing atmosphere.
   While the two were discussing the possible reunification of
Germany, Gorbachev said he and Bush had exchanged messages on the
question.
   ``The president wrote in English and I don't read English. I
answered him in Russian and he doesn't read Russian. But, we
agreed,'' said Gorbachev.
   ``No matter what it said,'' Bush added.

   Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev sets out from his first superpower summit meeting with
President Bush to lead his Warsaw Pact alliance into a new era of
cooperation with the West _ or risk being left behind and alone.
   As he and Bush parted after two days in the Mediterranean,
Gorbachev headed home for a meeting with a dramatically different
and more Westward-looking Warsaw Pact leadership than when members
last convened in July.
   The communist bloc alliance has become less communist and less a
bloc, presenting Gorbachev with the challenge of leading the
transition he described from a Kremlin-dominated military alliance
to a new political association guiding East Europe in its rush to
erase the lines that have divided East and West for 45 years.
   Culturally and geographically, Moscow's Warsaw Pact partners are
closer to the West than the vast Soviet Union straddling Europe and
Asia. And as they turn away from the Kremlin to face the West,
Gorbachev may find it increasingly difficult to drive his
stubbornly backward society at a quick enough pace to catch up.
   At his joint news conference with Bush closing their first
summit meeting, Gorbachev declared himself ``encouraged and
inspired'' by the changes that have swept hardline communists from
power in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
   The changes, he said, show ``the desire of these peoples to
ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic and
humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world.''
   But they also dramatically alter the Kremlin's once dominant and
domineering role in the alliance.
   For the first time since the pact was signed in the Polish
capital in 1955 in response to the formation of the North Atlantic
Treaty Alliance, one of the leaders present _ Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki _ will be a non-communist.
   Mazowiecki, a leader of the independent Solidarity labor
movement suppressed with Soviet support in 1981, was elected in
August to head East Europe's first non-communist government in four
decades.
   And on the eve of the summit, the leadership of East Germany, at
the heart of the strategic alliance, was wrenched by its second
spasm in recent weeks as communist leader Egon Krenz and the
party's entire top echelon abdicated to a 25-member panel of
reformers in a desperate effort to salvage some measure of support
for the Communist Party.
   Krenz relinquished the party post he had held less than six
weeks, and although he retained the largely ceremonial title of
president, it was not immediately clear who would represent East
Germany at the Moscow meeting.
   Several other East European leaders, including Petar Mladenov of
Bulgaria and Karel Urbanek of Czechoslovakia, are attending their
first Warsaw Pact leadership meeting.
   And for the first time since the alliance was formed, the head
of the Polish Communist Party, now out of power, apparently wasn't
invited at all.
   Nicolae Ceausescu, who continues to rule Romania with the iron
hand once rewarded by Moscow, is the only East bloc leader who
rejects the democratically inspired reform movement. With the
recent fall of orthodox communist leaders like Erich Honecker in
East Germany and Milos Jakes in Czechoslovakia, he is likely to
find himself more isolated than ever as he sits down with the new
generation of East European leaders.

<HEAD>Summit Offers Cure for Country With Identity Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before the dockside summit, this tiny
island nation suffered from an identity crisis. Maltese passports
even included a map to show doubtful foreigners that the country
exists.
   But that was before President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev came to Malta and put this rocky Mediterranean
archipelago back on everyone's map.
   The passports will be changed shortly after the first of the
year, said a slightly embarrassed Richard Cachia Caruana, the aide
to the prime minister who was in charge of organizing Malta's part
in the summit.
   ``That was a lack of self-confidence by the previous
government,'' he said, shaking his head. ``It's degrading.''
   Any lingering doubts by the Maltese about their country's
identity seemed to have been dispelled by the superpower summit, by
the words and images beamed abroad by about 2,500 journalists
covering the George Bush-Mikhail Gorbachev talks.
   ``For Malta itself, the summit has been very positive. It has
shown Malta can cope even with the necessary organization for a
summit like this,'' Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami said in an
interview after the summit closed Sunday.
   ``Some people were skeptical that Malta could do it. I think we
proved ourselves,'' he added.
   Not even the fierce December gale that drove the summit at sea
to the side of a pier could dampen the enthusiasm of the prime
minister.
   ``Well, I don't mind the weather at all. If anything, it has
proved I was correct when I suggested that the meetings should not
be held in Marsaxlokk but in some other bay, such as Grand Harbor,
which is more protected than Marsaxlokk Bay,'' he said.
   Cachia Caruana said the Soviets and Americans first planned to
hold the summit at sea, perhaps in Maltese territorial waters, but
that the prime minister had convinced them of the hazards of
December.
   ``Within 24 hours we made the point that this is December and
that these things can happen,'' he said.
   Still, he acknowledges the images of thunderous waves crashing
against the rocks below the 16th Century fortifications of the
capital Valletta won't help the island's winter tourism.
   ``In terms of what we had hoped to achieve overall, the tourism
objectives probably will not be met,'' said Cachia Caruana. ``But
our principal objective, especially in the United States, was name
identification.
   ``Just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a
way helped give us that anyway.''
   Cachia Caruana said Malta wants to base its growth on business,
not just tourism, and that's why the summit will help.
   ``Our greatest objective is dragging the economy into the last
decade of the 20th Century,'' he said.
   Still, in those first few hours after the departure of the
leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, the chief
Maltese organizer of the summit was relieved that it was over.
   ``It's been a hell of an experience. We had a situation here
where the journalists outnumbered the army by two-to-one,'' said
Cachia Caruana.
   ``It's back to business as usual tomorrow. We will assume it was
a dream and forget all about it.''

<HEAD>Despite High-Profile Buys, New York Isn't `Little Japan'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent Japanese purchases in Manhattan have made
some people nervous, despite a foreign-buyer tradition that started
when Dutch settlers snapped up the island for $24 worth of knives,
fabric and trinkets.
   Officials say a majority of Manhattan's buildings still are
owned by Americans, and Japanese are not even the largest foreign
landlords. Some find the alarm over Japanese purchases puzzling.
   ``I don't know what's behind this xenophobia,'' said Rosemary
Scanlon, an economist for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey. ``Everyone seems to have been jolted awake to find we're
not the only large economy in the world.''
   Several organizations have tried to estimate foreign holdings in
Manhattan commercial real estate, but no one really knows the
figure, said Edward S. Gordon, head of the real estate firm that
bears his name.
   ``When a foreigner buys a piece of property, he doesn't declare,
`I'm a foreigner,''' said Marie Hill, a researcher for the Real
Estate Board of New York. ``The owner's name may be Piccadilly
Properties, but there's no legislation requiring them to sign in as
British.''
   Foreign investments often are made through part ownerships,
joint ventures and convertible mortgages, which can further cloud
an owner's identity. ``On a mortgage the address might simply say,
`Return to Curacao''' said Ms. Hill.
   When Mitsubishi Estate Co. announced in October it was spending
$846 million for a controlling interest in the company that owns
Rockefeller Center, local wits said sumo wrestlers would soon take
over the center's ice skating rink.
   On a more gloomy note, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said of
the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony at the center in midtown
Manhattan, ``that great national celebration is actually occurring
on Japanese property.''
   But, noted Ms. Hill, ``the British and the Dutch have been
buying in this country for a long, long time,'' and it seems safe
to say that worries about foreigners buying up Manhattan are
exaggerated.
   ``For all the publicity, the amount of foreign-owned real estate
here is still pretty modest,'' said Scanlon. ``It's not such a big
deal.''
   According to the Port Authority, during the past 15 years
foreigners have acquired about 64 million of Manhattan's 335
million square feet of prime office space, or 19 percent. This
includes Canadians (7.3 percent), Japanese (5.4 percent), British
(2.7 percent) and Dutch (1.4 percent). Other foreigners have bought
more than 2 percent.
   The city's largest single foreign landowner is Olympia &amp; York of
Toronto, which shrewdly began buying in the depressed market of the
mid-1970s and now owns about 25 million square feet of office space
worth billion of dollars.
   Since 1986, Japanese investors have jumped into commercial real
estate, snapping up the Exxon, Citicorp, Mobil, ABC and Paine
Webber buildings. They also bought hotels, including the Algonquin,
the Stanhope, the Inter-Continental and the Essex House.
   But they have been even more active elsewhere. In 1988, when
Japanese investors bought $8.3 billion in U.S. real estate, twice
as much of that was in California as in New York state.
   More than half the office buildings in downtown Los Angeles are
foreign owned, according to the real estate firm of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield. Even in Atlanta, a city that was never a magnet for
foreign investment, 12 percent of the office space is owned by
foreigners, and some experts say that could rise to 50 percent by
the year 2000.
   Foreign investment in Manhattan office space will surely
increase _ Swedes and Koreans are said to be next in line for some
prime buildings _ but business executives, at least, aren't worried.
   In a survey released earlier this year, 55 percent of corporate
executives said foreign investment helped the U.S. economy, and 31
percent said it was little cause for alarm.
   Only 10 percent of real estate executives said foreign
investment severely threatened the U.S. economy.
   In fact, foreign investment is crucial to New York, said Ms.
Scanlon, noting that foreign money helped the city rebound from its
fiscal crisis a decade ago.
   ``It's important for the city's economy that investment come
in,'' she said. ``It's not so important where it comes from.''

   Here is the text of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's statement Sunday at the conclusion
of his two-day summit meeting with President Bush:
   There are many symbolic things about this meeting and one of
them _ it has never been in history that the leaders of our two
countries hold a joint press conference. This is also an important
symbol.
   I share the view voiced by President Bush that we are satisfied
in general with the results of the meeting. We regard this informal
meeting _ the idea of it was an informal meeting and the idea
belongs to President Bush, and I supported it _ that we would have
this informal meeting without restricting it to any formal agenda,
to have a free exchange of views, because the time makes great
demands to our countries, and this increases the responsibility and
the role of our two countries. And I can assure you that in all our
discussions _ and our discussions lasted for eight hours, in
general _ this responsibility on both sides was present.
   Our meeting was characterized by openness, by a full scope of
the exchange of views. Today, it is even difficult and perhaps
there is no sense to explain the entire range of issues that we
have discussed. I wish to say right away, nevertheless, that on all
the major issues, we attempted in a frank manner, using each side's
arguments, to explain our own positions, both with regard to the
assessment of the situation and the current changes in the world,
in Europe, and as regards disarmament issues. We addressed the
Geneva negotiating process, the Vienna process, and also
negotiations on the elaboration of the chemical weapons ban. All
those questions were considered thoroughly.
   The president and I, myself, also thought it necessary to
exchange views on our perception, both from Moscow and Washington,
of the ``hot'' places on our planet. And this exchange of views was
very significant and thorough. We reaffirmed our former positions
that all those issues, acute issues, must be resolved by political
methods. And I consider that this was a very important statement of
fact.
   We not only discussed problems and explained our positions, I
think that both sides had many elements which, if they are taken
into account in our future activities, activities of both
governments, then we can count on progress. This concerns the
subject of the reduction of strategic offensive arms by 50 percent.
And we have an optimistic assessment of the possibility to move
even next year to the conclusion of the Vienna treaty. We both are
in favor _ and this is our position. Naturally, we can be
responsible only for our position. We are in favor of signing this
document at the summit meeting.
   This time we discussed much bilateral relations. And I, on my
part, would like to note many positive elements and points which
were contained in statements and words by President Bush. Thus, I
would say that in all directions of the political dialogue of our
discussion, including bilateral relations, we not only confirmed
the consistency of our political course, the continuity of our
political course _ and I should say, although we had an informal
meeting, we met only for the first time with President Bush in his
capacity, and the confirmation of the continuity of the course is
an important element.
   What is also important is that during this informal meeting, we
have laid the foundation for increasing this. And I believe that in
the first place, it serves the interest of our both countries and
also the interests of the entire world community. Well, we have
made our contact a good contact. The atmosphere was friendly,
straightforward, open. And this enabled us to make good work. In
our position, the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate _ and that
is always that we should preserve elements of cautiousness _ and I
use the favorite word by President Bush. (Laughter.)
   Our world and our relations are at a crucial juncture. We should
be highly responsible to face up to the challenges of today's
world. And the leaders of our two countries cannot act as a fire
brigade, although fire brigades are very useful. We have to keep it
in mind also. This element was also present.
   I would like once again to thank the president for the idea of
holding this meeting with which we are satisfied, I hope. And I
would like to thank the people and the government of Malta, and to
express the words of appreciation and gratitude for their
hospitality. Thank you, Mr. President, for your cooperation.

   Here is the text of President
Bush's statement at the conclusion of his two-day summit meeting
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   Ladies and gentlemen, President Gorbachev has graciously
suggested I go first. And I don't think anyone can say that the
saltwater get-together was anything other than adventure, at least
out in the harbor here.
   First, I want to thank Prime Minister (Eddie Fenech) Adami and
the people of Malta and others for their warm and gracious
hospitality. I want to thank the captain and crew of (the USS)
Belknap for the great support that they've given us _ I think they
were wondering if I was about to become a permanent guest _ and a
special thanks to the captain and crew of (the Soviet cruise ship
Maxim) Gorky for their hospitality, and also thanks to the captain
and crew of (the Soviet naval cruiser) Slava who had been so
hospitable to many on the American side.
   I first approached Chairman Gorbachev about an informal meeting
of this kind after my trip to Europe last July. The amazing changes
that I witnessed in Poland and in Hungary, hopeful changes, led me
to believe that it was time to sit down with Chairman Gorbachev,
face to face, to see what he and I could do to seize the
opportunities before us to move this relationship forward. He
agreed with that concept of a meeting, and so we got rapid
agreement.
   And I think that the extraordinary ... developments in Europe
since the time that the meeting was proposed only reinforced the
importance of our getting together. So I'm especially glad we had
this meeting, and we did gain a deeper understanding of each
other's views. We set the stage for progress across a broad range
of issues.
   And while it is not for the United States and the Soviet Union
to design the future for Europeans or for any other people, I am
convinced that a cooperative U.S.-Soviet relationship can indeed
make the future safer and brighter.
   And there is virtually no problem in the world, and certainly no
problem in Europe, that improvement in the U.S.-Soviet relationship
will not help to ameliorate. A better U.S.-Soviet relationship is
to be valued in and of itself, but it also should be an instrument
of positive change for the world.
   For 40 years the Western alliances stood together in the cause
of freedom. And now, with reform under way in the Soviet Union, we
stand at the threshold of a brand-new era of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   And it is within our grasp to contribute, each in our own way,
to overcoming the division of Europe, and ending the military
confrontation there. We've got to do more to ameliorate the
violence and suffering that afflict so many regions in the world
and to remove common threats to our future.
   The deterioration of the environment, the spread of nuclear and
chemical weapons, ballistic missile technology, the narcotics
trade, and our discussions here will give greater impetus to make
real progress in these areas.
   There's also a great potential to develop common opportunities.
   For example, the Soviet Union now seeks greater engagement with
the international market economy, a step that certainly I'm
prepared to encourage in every way I can.
   As I leave Malta for Brussels and a meeting with our NATO
allies, I am optimistic that, as the West works patiently together
and increasingly cooperates with the Soviet Union, we can realize a
lasting peace and transform the East-West relationship to one of
enduring cooperation. And that is a future that is worthy of our
peoples, and that's the future that I want to help in creating, and
that's the future that Chairman Gorbachev and I began right here in
Malta.
   (To Gorbachev) Thank you, sir, for your hospitality.

<HEAD>Aquaculture a Growing US Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catfish farming has had some flip-flops over
the years but Agriculture Department experts say it looks good over
the long pull.
   For that matter, fish farming in general _ aquaculture is the
fancy name _ is expanding and shows promise if growers and
processors can hone their marketing skills.
   Catfish are the main items in U.S. aquaculture output, but
trout, salmon, crawfish and other species are also growing,
according to David J. Harvey of the department's Economic Research
Service.
   But there are problems. For example, catfish farmers have
boosted production so rapidly that sometimes the demand lags
supplies. In October, for example, production was estimated at 31.7
million pounds, live weight. That was up 21 percent from 26.2
million pounds a year earlier.
   Prices received by growers averaged 64 cents per pound, down 19
percent from 79 cents in October 1988.
   Harvey said aquaculture in the United States is still ``a young
and growing industry'' that is still going through adjustments that
may become even more important in the 1990s.
   A number of forces will contribute to the continued growth of
U.S. aquaculture, Harvey told last week's USDA outlook conference.
   ``First, the interaction of worldwide population growth and the
biological limits of what our oceans can supply should increase the
demand for farm-raised fish,'' he said. ``As the capture-fisheries
industry approaches maximum harvest rates for more and more
species, added pressure will be placed on aquaculture to become a
major source of seafood production.''
   Harvey said one sign of the pressure on commercial fishing _ the
``capture'' fisheries _ is the growing number of harvesting
restrictions being placed on species around the world.
   Another factor is the growing public concern about pollution of
ocean and fresh water resources. This ``should strengthen
aquaculture's position as an alternate source of seafood'' produced
under closely watched conditions, he said.
   ``However, aquaculturists must make the public aware of how
their products differ from those of the capture-fisheries
industry,'' Harvey said. ``To avoid consumer resistance to their
products due to pollution concerns, producers must maintain high
quality standards, be sensitive to consumer fears about
contaminated products, and be able to document the safety of their
products.''
   The ongoing emphasis on nutrition also should help boost seafood
consumption, he said.
   Other factors that may influence U.S. seafood consumption
include the general aging of Americans and the rising percentage of
non-whites.
   ``Both these groups, older people and non-whites, in the past
have consumed seafood at higher rates than the general
population,'' Harvey said. ``One (USDA) study combining changes in
age, race and income estimated that seafood expenditures for fish
products would increase 27.4 percent between 1980 and 2005, well
above the projected increases for beef, pork or poultry.''
   Harvey said if legislation is passed to require federal
inspection of seafood products it would boost consumer confidence
in the safety of U.S. seafood but would probably add some expense
to processing and marketing.
   ``The basic technologies are now in place for the expansion of
the domestic aquaculture industry, but producers will have to
successfully deal with a variety of issues that may impact future
growth,'' he said. ``The rate of growth for most aquacultural
species may depend on the industry's success at marketing its
products to a larger group of consumers.''

<HEAD>Wind Damage to Cropland Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soil erosion from water runoff declined
between 1982 and 1987, but wind damage to the nation's cropland
increased slightly, an Agriculture Department report said today.
   The latest National Resources Inventory released by the
department's Soil Conservation Service said ``sheet and rill''
erosion by water dropped to an average of 3.8 tons per acre
annually from 4.3 tons during the five-year period.
   Wind erosion, however, increased 0.1 ton per acre to 3.3 tons
per acre annually. Most wind erosion of cropland is concentrated in
the Great Plains states.
   Total sheet-and-rill erosion of cropland was reported at 1.6
billion tons per year and wind erosion at nearly 1.4 billion tons
annually.
   The national summary of the NRI _ a benchmark reference used
widely by government and private conservationists and others _ will
be followed next year by a complete report, officials said.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the Soil Conservation Service, said the
report includes information on erosion, cropland use, irrigation,
tillage and conservation needs.
   The area of rural non-federal land totals 1.4 billion acres, the
report said. Of this, 422.8 million acres are cropland; 401.7
million rangeland; 394.5 million forestland; and 59.9 million in
``minor land uses.''
   From 1982 to 1987, it said, 4 million acres of rural non-federal
land were converted to urban and transportation uses, which include
roads and airports.
   Cropland increased 1.4 million acres in the five years to 422.8
million from 421.4 million, while pastureland declined 2.3 million
acres and rangeland dropped 6 million acres.

   Weary network crews trudged home today after
following their anchormen from Czechoslovakia to Rome to Malta,
where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the
superpowers.
   At one point Saturday night, CBS anchor Dan Rather warned that
``if the weather doesn't improve, this thing's going to be a
wreck.''
   But from the TV standpoint, the only thing wrecked at the summit
was a small studio CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking
the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   A CNN spokesman said the structure was demolished by Saturday's
storm, which forced the cancellation of the day's second planned
meeting of the two leaders and sent network staffs scurrying to
reshape their coverage.
   CNN anchor Bernard Shaw had to remain with the other anchors in
the city of Valetta, six miles away. But that was only one of CNN's
problems.
   Saturday's 60 mph winds blew down and damaged a CNN satellite
dish, knocking out CNN's signal for eight hours. But a spokesman
said no transmissions had been planned during the period of the
blackout, which began at 9 p.m. EST.
   The storm also briefly affected ABC. Rain shorted out an
electrical connection at the start of anchor Peter Jenning's live
summit report from Malta during the first of two ``World News
Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its affiliates each night.
   But the Maltese connection was quickly restored. Jennings came
back on with his report eight minutes later.
   The storm didn't much affect CBS and NBC coverage of Saturday's
summit, to which the four U.S. networks brought a total of nearly
200 staff members.
   On Sunday, the weather was much better. But an electronic
problem caused a translation problem for NBC and CNN during the
live telecast of the superpower leaders' joint news conference
aboard the safely docked Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky.
   The Soviets provided the TV pool feed for broadcasters and an
audio channel offering a simultaneous English translations of
Gorbachev's remarks.
   However, during the last half hour of the session, an electronic
glitch knocked out the English-language channel. CBS and ABC had
translators standing by, so viewers didn't miss anything.
   NBC hastily summoned a Soviet official on Malta, but missed
eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help. After 13 minutes in which Shaw
recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an American
woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's comments.
She was Siobahn Darrow, translating from CNN headquarters in
Atlanta, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   The summit capped a busy week for the networks, during which
their anchors were based in Prague, Rome, and in the case of ABC,
West Germany.

<HEAD>Cruzan Says Daughter Wants to Die: `It Is The Right Decision For
Us'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL MANNING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During frequent visits to Nancy
Cruzan's hospital bedside, her father patiently recites the
brain-damaged woman's legal situation. She can't reply, but Joe
Cruzan says he knows her wishes.
   He says the Nancy he knew _ lover of laughter and life _ would
rather die than linger in her persistent vegetative state,
incapable of interacting with her environment and possessing no
thoughts, no emotions.
   ``I don't think this is a decision for every family, but it is
the right decision for us because we feel that is what Nancy would
want,'' said the 55-year-old sheet metal worker.
   Nancy Cruzan, 32, a former employee of a cheese factory, has
been in this condition since a 1983 car wreck, kept alive with a
feeding tube surgically implanted in her stomach. She stays, at
taxpayer expense, at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, a state
institution in Mount Vernon.
   On Wednesday, her parents will be in the U.S. Supreme Court,
listening again to the legal questions father shares with daughter
in the quiet of her hospital room.
   ``I've told her what the legal process is,'' Cruzan said. ``I've
said, `Nancy, I know this is scary,' because I think everyone to a
certain extent fears death. It's an unknown thing.''
   The case marks the first time the court has considered when it
is appropriate to stop medical treatment _ to pull the plug on a
life.
   Cruzan and his wife, Joyce, acting as Nancy's court-appointed
guardians, want to remove her feeding tube. A Missouri judge ruled
they could, but the state Supreme Court overturned that ruling in
November 1988.
   Missouri law allows people under certain circumstances to refuse
medical treatment but not food and water. Among the issues in the
Cruzan case is whether family members can make such a refusal on
behalf of an incompetent relative, and whether food and water
provided through a surgically implanted tube constitutes medical
treatment.
   The parents say they should have the final word about whether
their daughter lives or dies. They also say the state has no right
to force unwanted treatment on Nancy, and that she has not lost her
constitutional rights _ including the right to privacy _ because of
her condition.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster counters that the
state Supreme Court was correct in saying the parents cannot
terminate the use of the feeding tube.
   ``It's a question of whether the court will articulate a new
constitutional right for the family,'' he said. ``We don't think
the remedy the family is seeking is found in the United States
Constitution.''
   The most famous right-to-die case was never taken up by the
nation's high court. In 1976, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled
that Joseph and Julie Quinlan had a right to take their comatose
daughter, Karen Ann, off a respirator, and the federal justices
declined to review the decision. Ms. Quinlan's respirator was
removed, but she continued to be fed through a tube. She lingered
nine years before dying in 1985 at age 31.
   As the Cruzan case goes to Washington, Nancy lies in a bed, her
body stiff and her hands so bent they resemble claws, the
fingernails digging into her wrists if they go untrimmed.
   Doctors say Nancy could live 40 more years if she is given food
and water. Cruzan says Nancy wouldn't like that prospect. He hopes
the justices will agree.
   ``I feel like if they make a common sense judgment, they will
rule in our favor,'' he said from his home in Carterville in
southwestern Missouri. ``I do feel optimistic.''
   ``It's something that has to be done, something to achieve the
goal we have set out to achieve,'' he said.
   The Cruzans' attorney, Bill Colby, also expects to prevail.
   ``This is hopefully the end of a long, long road. But the family
has been willing to travel that road because they are doing what
they know, as only a family can know, that Nancy would want. It has
been an agonizing ordeal.''

<HEAD>Federal Prisons Bulging as Inmate Population Doubles in Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal prison system is 56 percent over
capacity, with more than twice as many inmates as in 1980 when the
system was less than 1 percent above capacity, a congressional
report says.
   Federal prisons contained 24,162 inmates in 1980, but the number
mushroomed to 48,017 by 1989, said the report Sunday by the General
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm.
   The 70 institutions operated by the federal system were designed
to hold a maximum of 30,860 prisoners.
   The report was requested by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Even under a Federal Bureau of Prisons plan to increase capacity
by 109 percent to 64,400 inmates within the next five years, the
system is still projected to be operating at 30 percent over
capacity, the report said.
   And authorities are projecting an inmate population of up to
147,000 in the federal system within a dozen years, the report said.
   It also contained these other findings:
   _Just 19 percent of prisoners counted in May 1989 were serving
time for violent offenses.
   _The price tag for expanding the prison system is $51,340 a bed.
   _Forty percent of inmates entering the system had a moderate or
serious substance abuse problem.
   _Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) represents a
potentially serious and costly problem for the prison system.
   The report also said state prison systems are operating at 23
percent over capacity with a total of 577,000 inmates. It said that
as of April, 35 states and the District of Columbia were operating
under court orders or consent decrees related to crowding.
   Rangel, chairman of the House select committee on narcotics,
said in a statement that until ``we get at the root causes of drug
abuse _ homelessness, joblessness, lack of education, lack of
health care and above all poverty _ we are likely to see continued
record overcrowding no matter how many prisons we build.''
   He said it is clear that most criminals are not being
rehabilitated by prison but instead are back behind bars within
three to five years. ``That is a very expensive process,'' he said.
   ``I recognize that it may not be politically popular, but we
have to provide alternative programs for nonviolent offenders with
education, rehabilitation, job training and drug treatment to
generate better citizens instead of more hardened criminals,''
Rangel said.
   Nunn said key reasons for the mushrooming prison population are
mandatory sentencing and stricter parole practices.
   ``Because prison overcrowding is often a key factor in increased
prison violence and disciplinary problems, we must have a better
handle on how to deal with the growing number of people entering
the prison systems,'' Nunn said.

<HEAD>Seven Referendums on North Dakota Ballot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALE WETZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakotans take a tradition of
political orneriness to the polls Tuesday in a special election
that will decide seven referendums, including higher taxes,
gambling and sex education.
   The debate has focused on whether to sustain the Legislature's
decision to raise taxes on income, sales and gasoline, a move
opponents contend will drive people and businesses out of a state
already in an economic slump.
   It also has pitted gambling opponents against the attorney
general, and the state health department against a parents' group
troubled by proposed mandatory health instruction in the public
schools.
   ``It's certainly been a difficult campaign,'' said Gov. George
Sinner, who has held dozens of public forums urging voters to
uphold the tax increases.
   Over the years, North Dakota voters have used referendums to
block construction of a state office building, reverse a college
name change and sustain a ban on municipal parking meters.
   However, they haven't had to vote on so many referendums at one
time since June 1919, when voters approved seven bills, said
Secretary of State Jim Kusler. One established the Bank of North
Dakota, which remains the nation's only state-owned bank.
   Sinner, a Democrat, won his second term last year with 60
percent of the vote against a Republican candidate who pledged not
to raise taxes.
   This fall, he threw himself into the lead role of campaigning
for the tax bills that would raise the sales tax from 5 percent to
6 percent; the gasoline tax from 17 cents to 20 cents a gallon; and
the income tax from 14 percent to 17 percent of a taxpayer's
federal tax bill.
   ``If I don't keep this state with a good future, I'm going to
consider my job and my work as a failure. Nothing else seems to me
to be any more important than that, and politics be damned,''
Sinner told reporters.
   The governor has used the specter of increased property taxes
and drastic cuts in education and social services if voters reject
the tax measures. Last week in Bismarck, he appeared on stage with
two men in wheelchairs, who spoke about their fears of cuts in
state human-services spending.
   Kent French, a Bismarck businessman who has led the fight
against the tax increases, says the governor is exaggerating their
possible impact.
   ``It's time for state government to make spending choices, the
same way families have had to do,'' French said. ``Their choice has
been to raise taxes, and that's got to stop.''
   In addition to the three separate referendums on taxes, voters
must decide whether to approve the sex education issue, a mandatory
seat-belt law, a retirement program for legislators and
legalization of video gambling machines. They also were considering
a proposed constitutional amendment to reorganize state government.
   Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth is advocating the gambling
machines as an honest alternative to pull tabs _ pull-apart paper
tickets that players draw at random from a jar in hopes of picking
one carrying a cash prize.
   But introduction of the machines is being fought by opponents of
state-sanctioned gambling, including former Gov. Arthur Link, and
pull tab manufacturers who fear the machines will cut into their
market.
   ``It certainly hasn't been a political success for me to endorse
the concept of electronic gaming. But I think it's the right thing
for North Dakota,'' Spaeth said last week.
   Debate over the health curriculum has centered on whether
information about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
belongs in public schools. The law under challenge in the
referendum would mandate health education in every school,
including information about sexually transmitted diseases. It
leaves decisions on details largely to individual districts.
   An opponent, Joanne Bergstedt, a registered nurse from the
western North Dakota community of Hazen, contends the teaching of
sexual abstinence should take precedence over instruction on the
use of contraceptives as a way of preventing disease.
   ``The opponents are looking for bogymen under every stone,''
countered Dr. Stephen McDonough, an official of the state health
department. He said the education program will emphasize abstinence.
   Polls indicate voters are leaning in favor of the seat belt and
health education laws but against electronic gambling and the
legislative retirement program.
   The polls initially showed overwhelming opposition to the tax
increases, but they have shifted in favor of tax advocates as the
election nears, and both sides predict a close result.
   ``It's going to go right down to the wire,'' French said. ``I
just pray to God it doesn't snow on December Fifth.''

<HEAD>Report Cites Serious Lapse in Security at Nuclear Weapons Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious security lapses involving large
amounts of plutonium were noted in an inspection earlier this year
of a federal nuclear weapons laboratory in California, a
congressional report says.
   The report released Sunday also said the Energy Department from
1982 through 1988 misled the president, in its annual reports to
the White House, about the adequacy of measures to protect
weapons-grade nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage.
   The report included a declassified transcript of a closed
hearing last July in which several senior Energy Department
officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the
nuclear weapons production and design complex. The hearing was held
by the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   The panel is investigating the department's nuclear weapons
facilities, which have been wracked by allegations of health,
safety and environmental violations. Some key plants have been
closed temporarily.
   According to the hearing transcript, Edward J. McCallum,
director of the Energy Department's weapons security evaluations
office, was highly critical of nuclear materials protection at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near Livermore, Calif.
   The Livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for
illegal drug use by some employees, alleged ethics and
conflict-of-interest violations by senior lab officials and charges
of theft of government property from the facility.
   The lab is run for the government by the University of
California.
   One passage from the McCallum report said security systems at a
Livermore building in which weapons-grade plutonium is handled ``do
not provide assurance'' that the highly radioactive material is
``adequately protected from theft or sabotage.''
   Also, it said the security system was unreliable in detecting
contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected
areas with access to nuclear materials.
   Under questioning from Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., McCallum
said these security lapses involved quantities of plutonium greater
than 4.5 pounds, which is enough to build a nuclear bomb.
   Another part of McCallum's report said the lab sometimes allowed
``category one'' quantities of plutonium to be left unattended in
rooms without security alarms. McCallum told Sikorski this was a
serious breach of security.
   McCallum's report was based on an inspection last April and May
of Livermore and the department's regional office in San Francisco
which oversees the lab's operations.
   Among other disclosures in the subcommittee report:
   _Among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices
inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards
by McCallum's office over the past year, Livermore ranked the
lowest.
   _The Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Las Vegas, Nev., regional offices
used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview
weapons plant employees seeking security clearances. These
contractors did not actually grant any clearances, but their role
nonetheless was contrary to department policy, officials said.
   _The department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to
complete investigations of suspected security violations by some
weapons employees who currently have access to classified material.
This violates the department's own policy, McCallum wrote in his
report, ``and does not provide assurance that only eligible
individuals are granted continued access to security interests.''
   The hearing also disclosed that the San Francisco regional
office had chosen not to include the plutonium-handling building in
its own most recent inspections of Livermore. Donald W. Pearman
Jr., acting manager of the San Francisco office, told the panel
that because of this omission, he was not aware of the plutonium
safeguards problems at the time of the McCallum inspection.
   In a later written response to Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
called the omission ``a serious oversight.'' Watkins also said the
San Francisco office had changed its inspection methods to include
``an intensive annual survey'' of all lab facilities.
   In the subcommittee report released Sunday, Dingell said annual
reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered ``a
misleading account'' of the level of protection being afforded
special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities.

<HEAD>Decreased Driving Pushing Down Price of Gasoline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gallon of gasoline cost about a half-cent
less at the nation's pumps during the past two weeks due to the
traditional fall-winter decrease in driving, according to an
industry analyst.
   The average service-station price of gasoline, including taxes,
was $1.0697 per gallon as of Dec. 1, according to a Trilby
Lundberg's biweekly survey of 13,000 stations.
   The previous retail average was $1.0751 per gallon.
   ``This continues a downward price trend that has prevailed ever
since late May except for two very small upward price moves,'' Ms.
Lundberg said Sunday. She said the decline can be attributed to
decreased driving that normally occurs at this time of year. Prices
were cut to spur sales.
   Prices per gallon at self-service pumps as of Dec. 1 were: 95.10
cents for regular unleaded, $1.1271 for premium unleaded and 96.46
cents for regular leaded.
   At full-service stations average prices were: $1.2594 for
regular unleaded, $1.3887 for premium unleaded and $1.2334 for
regular leaded.

<TEXT>
   Randall Dale Adams, who was freed from prison
after his case was documented in the movie ``The Thin Blue Line,''
said it felt strange to return to the city where he was convicted
of killing a policeman.
   Adams' first return to Dallas since his release from state
prison last March was because of a benefit dinner for an
organization that investigates the cases of people who may have
been wrongly convicted.
   Adams, who now in Columbus, Ohio, spent 12 years behind bars for
the 1976 shooting death of the policeman.
   ``Being back here is a little strange. You can understand that
the last time I was here I was pretty anxious to leave,'' Adams
said Saturday night at the dinner for Justice Denied Research Inc.
   ``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned the testimony of prosecution
witnesses in the case. A state appeals court later overturned the
conviction and authorities chose not to seek a retrial.
   Adams was beginning a 12-day tour of Italy this week to
correspond with the European premiere of ``The Thin Blue Line'' and
speak at an annual meeting of Amnesty International.
   Adams, accompanied by his mother, Mildred Adams, said he stopped
in Dallas to encourage the efforts of Justice Denied Research,
which is led by Jim Humphreys.
   Humphreys obtained information that was instrumental in the
release of Lenell Geter, an engineer from South Carolina who spent
two years in Texas prisons for a robbery before another suspect was
identified.

   Karen Prince always planned to use her legal
training to help the disabled. But the deaf Rutgers University law
student found she also needed her skills to help herself.
   Ms. Prince, a 39-year-old third-year law student who represented
herself in a court hearing, won a court order forcing the
university to supply her with class notes.
   Her victory was one of two last week that upheld rights of the
disabled. A federal judge ruled that a school district in White
Plains, N.Y., must supply a sign-language interpreter for deaf
parents at school-sponsored parents conferences.
   Both lawsuits were filed under the federal Rehabilitation Act of
1973, which says any organization receiving federal aid cannot
discriminate against the handicapped.
   ``We have two examples of recipients of federal financial
assistance ... which refused to provide services of meaningful
access to the programs,'' said Marc Charmatz, attorney for the
National Association for the Deaf Legal Defense Fund, which brought
the New York case. ``In both cases, the court recognized that the
deaf parents or the deaf student were denied meaningful access.''
   The New York case is the first of its kind in the country,
according to Charmatz. Coupled with the New Jersey case, it
provides leverage to force school districts to comply with the
federal guidelines, he said.
   ``This is an illustration of what school districts must do,''
Charmatz said.
   Ms. Prince said her case marks the first time federal civil
rights provisions have been used to force a university to supply
assistance for a deaf student.
   When she began taking classes at the Camden campus in 1986, she
said the university agreed to provide note-takers and interpreters
for every course.
   Since then, Ms. Prince has filed two civil rights claims
contending the university failed to live up to its promise. In one
instance, she rejected notes she said were illegible.
   In the latest battle, a judge ordered the school provide
note-takers and issued a temporary restraining order barring
Rutgers from holding two classes unless Ms. Prince received
transcribed notes within 24 hours of each class.
   Audrey Blackburn, associate dean of student affairs, said the
university late last week hired a court stenographer to take notes
for four one-hour lecture sessions. The service costs about $1,400,
she said.
   The university has spent about $10,000 a year to provide
sign-language translators and note-takers for Ms. Prince, school
officials said. School spokesmen have said they have had trouble
finding qualified candidates.
   The law requires ``that one exert reasonable efforts and I
believe I did above and beyond that,'' Blackburn said.
   Ms. Prince, the only deaf student attending the 700-student law
school, expects to graduate this semester, which ends Dec. 22.
   ``My first year I almost quit three times,'' she recalled in an
interview done with an interpreter and through Ms. Prince's
lip-reading ability. ``It was so horrible. I just stuck it out.''
   Her determination earned her classmates' admiration.
   ``I have a great amount of respect for the fact that she's come
to law school and overcome her handicap. That's kind of
impressive,'' said Ross Gigliotti, 24, a third-year student from
Cherry Hill.
   Ms. Prince began losing her hearing during her last two years of
undergraduate study at the University of Delaware, and became deaf
in 1972.
   She learned sign language at Gallaudet College in Washington,
D.C., and later worked as a legal secretary and researcher. A
strong interest in political science and tougher legislation to
help the disabled spurred her interest in law school.
   Ms. Prince said she is considering setting up practices in
several legal areas _ public interest, civil rights or contract law.
   ``I have a very strong interest in education and education of
the handicapped,'' she said. ``That comes from what I've seen in
how hard it is to get an education.''

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
on Monday, while the leading index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange won
back Friday's losses and rose to another record high.
   The dollar closed at 143.48 yen, up 0.40 yen from Friday's close
of 143.08 yen. It opened at 143.37, its low for the day, and ranged
as high as 143.70 yen in mixed trading.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 136.11 points on Friday, rose 171.19 points, or
0.46 percent, to close at 37,303.87.
   It was the highest closing ever for the market's main barometer.
The previous record closing was set Thursday, when the Nikkei index
closed at 37,268.79.
   Traders had predicted the dollar would range between 143.40 yen
and 143.80 yen during the Tokyo trading day, saying a general lack
of interest should keep the market fairly quiet.
   Traders said the quiet holiday mood should continue during a
week which promises little fresh economic news to trade on until
Friday's report on U.S. unemployment data for November.
   The market will watch Friday's report carefully for clues on
possible easing moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   ``Political developments in Europe are fairly difficult for the
Tokyo market to interpret,'' one dealer said of the weekend's U.S
-Soviet summit.

<HEAD>AMA Executive Admits Errors in Financial Flap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON STATON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association's top executive
said he made mistakes in approving two money-losing internal
financial deals, but denied that the resulting controversy spurred
him to retire.
   ``I accept responsibility for the errors and the changes that
are needed to prevent their recurrence,'' AMA Executive Vice
President Dr. James H. Sammons told the opening ceremony of the
group's mid-year meeting.
   Sammons and Dr. John J. Ring, chairman of the board of trustees,
said in speeches to the AMA House of Delegates that Sammons' plans
to retire at the end of his current contract were known months ago.
   The 425 delegates are meeting through Wednesday to set AMA
policy on numerous national health-care issues, but the internal
financial controversy has captured much of their attention. The
Chicago-based AMA is the nation's largest organization for doctors,
with nearly 300,000 members.
   The controversy centers on revelations this fall that Sammons
approved a $353,000 reimbursement to a former AMA executive for
losses in a 1987 high-risk stock market fund, and a 1985 loan to
another AMA executive to buy a high-price condominium during the
latter's divorce.
   The executive involved in the stock-market loss has promised to
pay back the money with interest. The recipient of the 1985 loan
later defaulted, costing the AMA $50,000 to foreclose.
   Ring told the delegates an investigation is continuing and a
full report will be made to the House of Delegates. He said the
board would take steps so that ``this will not happen again.''
   The board on Saturday issued a report saying Sammons acted
within his authority in the two deals, but ``failed to follow the
usual fiscal policies and procedures.''
   AMA spokesman Mark Stuart said trustees declined to elaborate.
   The board also said it had accepted Sammons' plan to retire,
effective March 31, 1991.
   Stuart said it was unclear why the board had included the
retirement plans in the report on the deals. Sammons, who is widely
respected for rescuing the AMA from financial disaster when he took
the job in 1974, plans to give up day-to-day management of the AMA
at the end of next year.
   The board report also proposed a restructuring of its committees
and hiring of an outside accounting firm. It said the board would
set tighter fiscal limits on the authority of the executive vice
president, but did not elaborate.
   The House of Delegates also will consider a resolution passed
last month by the Washington State Medical Association urging
Sammons be placed on administrative leave until the investigation
is completed.
   On Sunday, Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos asked the
physicians for help in improving and restructuring the nation's
education system. He asked the physicians to help raise public
awareness of the nation's educational shortcomings.
   During the meetings, the AMA delegates also will consider
reports and resolutions that would:
   _ Acknowledge a patient's right to basic and essential health
care;
   _ Establish policies regarding ``maternal-fetal conflict,'' such
as when an expectant mother refuses medical treatment that would
benefit her fetus;
   _ Encourage health-insurance companies to develop reduced-cost
coverage for non-smokers;
   _ Urge a lowering of the blood-alcohol level to 0.05 percent for
determination of drunken driving;.
   _ Work toward listing tobacco as a contributing factor on death
certificates.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's fledgling opposition movement
is splintered into at least five groups and lacks the kind of
charismatic leader found in Poland or Czechoslovakia.
   Despite often diverging goals, everyone agrees on the need to
strip the Communists of their 40-year grip on absolute power and to
hold the nation's first free elections _ even the Communists.
   ``The Communists and their allies keep stealing and adopting our
positions, to make themselves seem like a new and more trustworthy
force,'' complains Lutheran Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, an opposition
leader.
   Unlike its Communist neighbors, the East German opposition has
no major figure like Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel and no patron like
the Roman Catholic or Protestant churches. East Germany's
best-known opposition figure is New Forum's Baerbel Bohley, a
44-year-old East Berlin artist and painter.
   And while Solidarity had years of struggle that also let the
Polish opposition fine-tune its platform, East Germany's
pro-democracy forces suddenly have been thrown into the breach.
   The groups have been operating completely in the open for only
two months _ and free elections could be held as early as autumn.
Opposition leaders are scheduled to meet the Communists on Dec. 7
to discuss the nation's future.
   The activists have made a series of sometimes divergent demands.
They range from a better environment to a free choice on unity for
the two Germanys. Some disagree on unification and on whether to
make the state-controlled economy more market-oriented.
   New Forum is the largest group, with about 200,000 members and
made up in large part of young street protesters. Other groups
include the 150-member Greens party, the Social Democrats,
Democracy Now and Eppelmann's Demokratische Aufbruch, which means
democratic ``start'' or ``awakening.''
   Eppelmann, a genial Lutheran cleric in jeans and running shoes,
said the country's only hope lies in a multi-party system embracing
the Communists, their allies and the new opposition parties.
   ``The established ones can't go it alone, and the new groups
can't do it alone,'' he said. ``There will have to be a grand
coalition of internal reason.''
   Just where that coalition would head remains unclear, and even
Eppelmann acknowledges it's difficult to say if there is room for
all the envisioned participants in the new government.
   ``There has to be a pluralistic spectrum of organizations, where
we can then develop a majority,'' said local New Forum leader
Christoph Poehlmann in East Berlin's Pankow district. ``And there
can only be majorities when there is diversity first.''
   But Poehlmann acknowledged: ``The time for just asking questions
is behind us. There is growing support for running candidates.''
   Right now, it is uncertain whether the opposition will run as
one group or as scattered forces against the Communists.
   ``Replacing the Communists with another bloc that lays claim to
power and perhaps to truth in a monolithic way is not our goal,''
Poehlmann said during a weekend meeting.
   In one sense, New Forum, despite massive publicity and support,
is having growing pains in changing from a market place for ideas
to a true political force.
   ``The basic idea of New Forum was to think about what we can do
in this country, where can it go? Do we want to be like the West, a
consumer society?'' said New Forum co-founder Luise Schramm. ``That
process continues. In eight weeks, you can't reach conclusions.''
   New Forum's leaders want to keep some components of East
Germany's socialist structure, while warning that growing talk of
reunification threatens to derail the reform process in the country
of 16.5 million people.
   A public opinion poll published by West Germany's Stern magazine
said if elections were held now, New Forum would be the winner with
22 percent of the vote. The Communists would be in third place
behind the Communist-allied Liberal Democratic party, Stern said.
   Mounting an election campaign in a Western sense would be amost
impossible in a country where essentials like typewriters and
photocopying machines are in short supply _ and where the national
telephone system seems on the verge of collapse.
   The opposition also is likely to find itself being courted _ and
perhaps partially co-opted _ by the Communists themselves.
   Ingo Klein, a member of New Forum and the Communist Party, said
East Germany is suffering from a ``lack of new concepts'' that
brought the opposition into being in the first place.
   Klein estimated that 10 percent of New Forum's members belong to
the 2-million strong Communist Party, adding he looks forward to
``a government of all the important forces that unite this country.
   Klein, a 39-year-old university economist, insists there will be
no contradication in his dual membership even when New Forum runs
candidates against the Communists.
   ``I wouldn't be the servant of two masters,'' he said with a
smile, saying he can still support both groups.

<HEAD>Bikers Deliver Toys to L.A. Skid Row Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 400 motorcyclists, from yuppie
weekenders in exotic leather to hard-core bikers in soiled denim
``colors,'' delivered toys to a Skid Row mission in a thundering
testament to good will.
   The walls of the Fred Jordan Mission echoed from the blast of
arriving and departing Harley-Davidsons, Hondas, Kawasakis and
other big road bikes as the members of the Harley Owners Group
(HOG) and other motorcycle clubs made their second annual delivery
for the mission.
   Some Skid Row residents looked astounded at the polished
machines, some of them festooned with Christmas garlands and
mounted by riders wearing red and fur-trimmed Santa Claus hats.
Others took the opportunity to collect empty aluminum soda cans
left by the riders.
   ``I think it's the neatest thing there is,'' said Ferdie
Chaddick of West Los Angeles.
   Resplendent in black leather pants and jacket, Chaddick watched
and laughed as Skid Row children and mission workers sat astride
his $16,000 Harley for a snapshot.
   It belied, he admitted, the old biker motto that nobody _
NOBODY, touches a man's machine.
   ``The thing with the mission run is, we just go along with
everything,'' said Chaddick, a Santa Monica glazier.
   The delivery to the Jordan Mission on Sunday was part of a
larger effort in which the Salvation Army said it expected 25,000
motorcyclists to drop off toys in the Dodger Stadium parking lot
for the Army's 1989 Toy Run.
   ``We enjoy it, and its great for these needy kids,'' said South
Bay Harley Owner Group member Skip Fottler, who made the run to the
mission with his wife, Mary.
   ``A lot of people think we're hellions, but we're trying to drag
down that old image,'' Fottler said. ``We have doctors, lawyers,
policemen, firemen. We're just a band of bikers.''
   The mission hopes to collect 40,000 new toys for its huge annual
Christmas party on Dec. 16. About 20,000 people are expected this
year, said Willie Jordan, widow of mission founder Fred Jordan.
   ``Last year, we expected 15,000, and we got 20,000,'' Mrs.
Jordan said. The mission ran out of toys and food bags, and about
3,000 people went away empty-handed.
   ``It was one of the saddest days in my life. I just wanted the
street to swallow me up,'' she said.

<HEAD>Two Die As Charter Fishing Boat Sinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials located the wreck of a fishing
boat that sank in the main channel entrance to New York Harbor,
killing two people, and warned other boats to avoid the spot.
   The 110-foot Bronx Queen sank Saturday afternoon with 19 people
aboard. All were pulled from the water, but two men in their 50s
who were among the passengers on the chartered fishing trip died
later of hypothermia. Three people remained hospitalized today.
   Lt. Craig Lloyd of the Coast Guard operations center in Boston
said Sunday a Coast Guard helicopter had found the spot where the
Bronx Queen sank.
   ``Our concern is that it's a hazard to navigation,'' Lloyd said.
   The captain, 26-year-old Jack Chale, said the boat was in 40
feet of water ``when we hit something, hit a submerged object.
Whatever it was, I have no idea. I never saw it.''
   The boat immediately began taking on water and went down at the
harbor entrance about 15 miles southeast of the Verrazano Narrows
Bridge, which connects Staten Island and the borough of Brooklyn.
   Melissa Rivera, Chale's girlfriend, said she was inside the boat
when she heard the whistle announcing it was time to head back to
the Bronx, the boat's port.
   She went out to join her grandmother, mother and aunt on deck
and ``I saw the back of the boat was all full of water.''
   The passengers helped each other don life preservers and jumped
into the water to be rescued because Coast Guard vessels could not
get close enough to the sinking boat, Ms. Rivera said.

<HEAD>Challenges Great As Multiparty Democracy Takes First Steps</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the completion of its first
multiparty election ever, this island of 20 million people, already
credited with an economic miracle, is poised for a political one.
But the challenges are great.
   The political equation of Taiwan was rearranged over the weekend.
   Observers hailed the vote as a step forward for democracy even
though it was marred by allegations of widespread vote-buying. ``A
Nationalist Setback, Redistribution of Political Power,'' read one
newspaper headline.
   Most stunning, indeed, were the losses suffered by the
Nationalist Party, which has ruled Taiwan for 40 years after
fleeing a Communist takeover on the Chinese mainland. Nationalist
candidates polled 58 percent of the popular vote, down from 70
percent in 1986.
   Next in line came the strong showing of a feisty 2-year-old
opposition party, which won important posts in local elections and
gained in the national Legislature.
   ``This is a glorious victory,'' said opposition leader Tsai
Shi-yuan.
   The Democratic Progressive Party, of which Tsai is deputy
secretary general, garnered 33 percent of the vote and independent
allies swelled its total to nearly 40 percent. Two years ago, it
won 22 percent.
   Much of the party's support came from native Taiwanese, who make
up about 80 percent of the population but were displaced
politically when the Nationalists seized power in 1949.
   A third development was the relatively free debate in the
campaign. One candidate, a former dancer, ran on a platform of free
love. She lost.
   Others openly risked charges of sedition when they called on
Taiwan to declare itself independent from China and abandon the
dream of recovering the mainland. At least 20 of 32 members of a
pro-independence group won seats in various contests.
   Taiwan's rapid economic growth in the 1970s created an
increasingly sophisticated population, which chafed at laws that
could jail men and women for speaking their minds.
   Several years after the 1975 death of autocratic President
Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalists began experimenting with
political reform. Martial law was lifted in 1987 after 38 years;
limited press freedoms were granted; political parties were
legalized.
   But many said reforms came too slow. And the vote Saturday
appears to be a rejection of the pace of change in a political
system that still perpetuates Nationalist rule.
   Television and radio remain under Nationalist control and were
criticized throughout the campaign for anti-opposition reporting.
   Even if the opposition won every vote, it could not have
challenged Nationalist control. The 256-seat Legislature and the
electoral college are dominated by hundreds of elderly Nationalists
elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late 1940s and
frozen in office to support the party's claim to be the legitimate
ruler of all China.
   Despite the problems, the oppositions made huge gains.
   In the Legislature, the opposition and its allies won at least
21 seats, up from 12 seats. For the first time in Taiwan's history,
the opposition can introduce legislation because 20 co-sponsors are
required for each bill.
   The opposition also captured six of the country's 16 county
executive posts and other local seats. With these victories, the
opposition is presented with the challenge of proving it can run a
local government and solve environmental problems and a
skyrocketing crime rate.
   The opposition also can move to limit the far-reaching control
of the Nationalists over everyday life.
   A model cited by many is an independent candidate who was
elected as county executive of Ilan in 1986 and is dismantling the
Nationalist Party machine in his district.
   Surveillance files kept on government employees were burned,
pictures of Nationalist leaders were taken down, political
indoctrination is being reduced in the schools and a nuclear power
plant, backed by Nationalists, was stopped.
   ``One of the first things I will do is demolish the Nationalist
Party headquarters,'' said You Ching, in a speech to supporters
after he won the executive seat in Taipei county. ``Then you will
be able to walk your dogs on the property.''
   Still, pundits have warned opposition candidates not to push the
Nationalists too far too fast.
   Although possibilities for a conservative backlash appear
slight, the Nationalists might be tempted to pass legislation
limiting the power of the local governments and negating opposition
gains.
   Such tactics could spark unrest among the people. Allegations of
vote-rigging during the election caused thousands to surround
county offices. Early today, about 10,000 protesters who accused
the Nationalists of vote fraud ended a 30-hour siege of a
government office in southern Taiwan.
   For the Nationalists, the election challenged an aging party
that has grown somewhat fat on the luxury of one-party rule.
   ``We calmly accept an upset,'' Party Secretary General James
Soong said after a hastily held meeting of party leaders Sunday.
``We shall continue with reforms and improve what we did not do
well.''
   Some in the party have called for faster political reforms.
   ``The vote shows the people demand change,'' said C.L. Chiou, a
political science professor. ``The Nationalists must bend with the
wind.''

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Probes Dinkins Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor-elect David Dinkins said he was not
worried by a federal probe into a stock transfer to his son, said
to be part of a larger investigation into a cable television
franchise.
   ``I'm confident this inquiry will reveal that there's nothing
with which I need to be concerned,'' Dinkins said Sunday. ``Those
of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny of all
sorts over time.''
   Dinkins said the investigation stems from a suggestion by his
defeated opponent in the Nov. 7 mayoral election, Republican
Rudolph Giuliani, who said during the campaign that the stock deal
should be examined.
   Charles Stillman, an attorney for Dinkins, described the federal
investigation as ``Rudy Giuliani's last hurrah.'' Giuliani is the
former Manhattan U.S. attorney.
   The Daily News reported Sunday that Andrew Maloney, U.S.
attorney based in Brooklyn, is investigating the transaction of
stock by Dinkins to his son, David Jr.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether Dinkins
transferred Inner City Broadcasting Corp. stock to his son through
a genuine transaction in 1985, how much the stock was worth and
whether all due taxes were paid, the News reported.
   Inner City owns several radio stations and one of its
subsidiaries has a substantial interest in Queens Innerunity Cable
Systems, a cable franchise. Inner City's chairman, former Manhattan
Borough President Percy Sutton, is a longtime friend of Dinkins.
   Dinkins has said he first acquired stock in the privately held
company in 1972 and his holdings grew to 588 shares, largely
through stock splits.
   After his election as Manhattan borough president in 1985,
Dinkins said, he began transferring the stock to his son to avoid a
conflict between his position on the city Board of Estimate and the
board's role in regulating cable television.
   Ann Driscoll, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney, characterized
the investigation as a ``preliminary inquiry into some financial
transactions.'' She refused to elaborate.
   During the campaign, it was revealed that Dinkins had not paid a
gift tax. Dinkins released a handwritten note, dated Oct. 30, 1985,
in which his son agreed to buy the stock. But Dinkins declined to
release financial or corporate records that might further document
the transaction.
   As part of the investigation, the News said, the age of the
paper and ink are being tested to determine whether the note was
written in 1985 or during the campaign. There also are plans to
analyze the handwriting, the newspaper said.
   The city's Department of Investigation is conducting a separate,
previously disclosed probe into whether Dinkins filed misleading
financial disclosure forms pertaining to the stock.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Large U.S. Law Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sexual harassment and limited opportunity for
advancement are part of a woman's work environment at large U.S.
law firms, a study says.
   The survey, published in today's edition of the National Law
Journal, was based on responses from 918 women lawyers who work in
large law firms in 13 cities.
   Most women said they were at a disadvantage when it came to
advancement. Sixty-four percent said men had a better chance at
gaining management positions and 49 percent said men were more
likely to be promoted.
   According to the survey, 60 percent of respondents said they had
experienced unwanted sexual attention, such as sexual teasing,
remarks or questions, from co-workers or clients. Nearly one-third
said they had experienced sexual looks or gestures.
   The lawyers who responded to the survey earned between $50,000
and $250,000 a year. Thirteen percent said they felt their male
counterparts earned higher salaries and bigger bonuses.
   The majority of the women felt they had to give up time for
family, friends or outside interests to pursue their law careers,
but they indicated that male lawyers made the same sacrifices.
   The survey participants worked in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
Cleveland, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, New
York, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington, D.C.
   The survey was conducted by the National Law Journal and West
Publishing of Minneapolis, Minn., the nation's largest publisher of
legal publications.

   Its monopoly on power gone, the
Communist Party is on the run, looking desperately for new strength
in the forthcoming political battle for control.
   Communists were the vanguard of reform during the ill-fated
``Prague Spring'' under Alexander Dubcek until the spontaneous
freedom movement was squelched by Soviet tanks in 1968.
   But new forces seem to be in charge this time around.
   ``The future requires giving up the monopoly of power,'' new
party leader Karel Urbanek said last week.
   A 77-year-old veteran Communist says it's ``hard to foresee any
kind of real political comeback for the party, now that the lies
and incompetence are here for everyone to see, hear and read about.
   The man, requesting anonymity, said ``only a miracle'' can save
the Communist leadership from collapse now that the 2-week-old
peaceful popular revolt has shaken it to the core.
   In a stormy party Central Commitee meeting Nov. 24, former
premier Lubomir Strougal called the demonstrations ``an expression
of civil dissatisfaction with us, our way of leadership and rule.''
   ``Let us admit our share of responsibility,'' the party daily
Rude Pravo quoted him as saying.
   Days later, the party decided to revise its stand on the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion, part of its speedy move to jettison the
leaders and policies of the last 21 years.
   Those aging party members, who carried the torch of ``real
socialism'' from the 1948 Communist takeover until November 1989,
have been spared a younger Communist generation's worries about the
party's future.
   ``I'm of the opinion that the entire Communist Party should be
disbanded and possibly associate under a different name, if we find
the right program and people willing to do it,'' Vit Spanhel, 43, a
Communist journalist, told The Associated Press.
   That has already happened in Hungary, where the unpopular
Communist Party dissolved itself last month and christened a new
ruling party _ the Socialists _ as part of its attempt to save
itself from overwhelming defeat in free elections next year.
   With a membership of 1.7 million _ roughly one in every six
Czechoslovak adults is a Communist _ the party is still the best
organized political force in the country.
   It may be hit by massive defections now that its power is
eroded. But it still has control of thousands of offices and
factories and many of the people who run them.
   Vaclav Havel, the country's leading dissident and the unofficial
leader of the Civic Forum opposition coalition, says that by
comparison his group is composed of ``political amateurs.''
   The country's Socialist Party and People's Party, formerly
docile Communist allies, have now begun to flourish in the new
atmosphere of free speech. Membership applications are pouring in,
but both parties still remain comparatively tiny forces of less
than 50,000 members.
   A broad spectrum of several independent parties, similar to that
in Hungary, is expected to emerge before free elections take place,
probably late next year.
   Czechoslovak wits are beginning to mourn the easy target they
found in the Communists for 40 years.
   Hinting at the clumsiness of former leader Milos Jakes and the
depressing obscurity of the new communist chief, the writing on the
subway wall said last week:
   ``Milos, come back, Urbanek is no fun!''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark says it will be difficult to find a competent lawyer
to defend an American woman accused of hiding weapons for leftist
guerrillas.
   Clark said Sunday that the woman, Jennifer Jean Casolo, had
decided to stand trial in the case rather than be deported.
   He said that even with a good lawyer, ``it would be extremely
difficult if not impossible'' for Ms. Casolo to get a fair trial
amid the pressure of war and the near paranoia about foreigners in
El Salvador.
   Ms. Casolo was due to be arraigned today, he said, most likely
before a military tribunal. He was not sure precisely what charges
would be filed.
   Authorities say they uncovered a huge guerrilla arms stash
buried in her yard. Clark said Ms. Casolo didn't know the munitions
and explosives were there.
   Ms. Casolo, who represents a San Antonio-based ecumenical group
called Christian Educational Seminars, is deeply committed to her
work in El Salvador, he said.
   The formeer attorney general, who has been retained by Ms.
Casolo's family but is not licensed to practice law in El Salvador,
said he had hoped Ms. Casolo would agree to be deported rather than
tried but that is not the case.
   ``Every heart has to be somewhere and her heart chose El
Salvador,'' he said. ``She doesn't want to go home.''
   Clark said Ms. Casolo has begun a ministry inside the jail where
she has been held since her arrest Nov. 26.
   Ms. Casolo, 28, a native of Thomaston, Conn., moved into the
house in May but was not at home for long periods of time,
including all of September, Clark said.
   Ms. Casolo's friends say she is being framed to justify a
government crackdown on churches and humanitarian groups that came
in reaction to a three-week-old guerrilla offensive.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, has denied
any connection with Ms. Casolo, who was known for her work guiding
visiting church groups and congressional aides.
   The rightist government has imposed a state of siege that
suspends most constitutional rights, and the National Assembly has
passed a severe new anti-terrorism law.
   The bill has not yet been signed by President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Ms. Casolo came to El Salvador in 1985 after working for two
years with Central American refugees in Seattle.
   Authorities say they found more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition
for AK-47 assault rifles, 213 blocks of TNT, detonators, 106 60mm
mortar rounds and other munitions buried in her yard.
   Ms. Casolo is being held in a cell with two other women, Clark
said.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eden Pastora, the Sandinista
revolutionary hero turned Contra rebel leader, has ended eight
years of exile and told supporters that neither Moscow nor
Washington should influence Managua.
   The legendary fighter known as Commander Zero was mobbed on his
arrival Sunday at the airport in the Nicaraguan capital.
   A caravan of vehicles carried him and supporters to the former
National Palace, where he and about 20 fighters in 1978 held
legislators hostage until then-President Anastasio Somoza released
50 Sandinista prisoners, including Daniel Ortega and Tomas Borge,
now the president and the interior minister.
   ``I have come to take over the palace that's called Nicaragua,''
Pastora told several hundred supporters, who cheered wildly at the
reference to the bold exploit that made him known worldwide.
   Pastora said the Social Christians _ not the leftist government
or the U.S.-backed opposition coalition _ are the true followers of
Nicaraguan nationalist hero Augusto Cesar Sandino.
   ``We are anti-imperialist with Moscow and we are
anti-imperialist with Washington,'' Pastora told the crowd at the
adjacent Plaza of the Revolution.
   Pastora scoffed at Sandinista accusations that he betrayed the
revolution when he left them to fight in 1983 with the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels.
   He said the Sandinista commanders are the ``true
counterrevolutionaries'' because their standards of living now are
much higher than most Nicaraguans.
   Pastora also said that although he personally respected
opposition presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro, her 14-party
National Opposition Union was made up of opportunists and followers
of the late Somoza.
   Pastora's reception at the airport, organized by two factions of
the Social Christian Party, was the largest by far for any of the
many exiled leaders who have returned to Nicaragua this year to
join the political fight against the Sandinistas.
   On the way downtown, Pastora waved tentatively at people
standing on sidewalks waiting for buses, many of whom stared back
with blank expressions.
   Standing with Pastora were Erick Ramirez of the Social Christian
Party and Mauricio Diaz of the People's Social Christian Party.
   Two months ago Diaz threw his support behind Ramirez's
presidential candidacy after splitting from Ms. Chamorro's
coalition.
   Pastora has run a fishing cooperative in neighboring Costa Rica
since he ended three years with the Contras and quit the armed
struggle against the Sandinistas in 1986.
   When the Sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular revolt
that forced Somoza to flee the country, Pastora was named vice
minister of defense and enjoyed wide popularity.
   But the man who called himself a nationalist was at odds with
his more radical leftist comrades and grew disillusioned with the
Sandinista revolution. Some say he grew bitter because he was not
made defense minister.
   Pastora distanced himself from the Sandinistas in 1981, then
dropped from sight.
   He emerged in 1983 and said he would fight the Sandinistas. But
he constantly criticized his Contra colleagues, saying they
misspent money.
   The Contras welcomed the propaganda coup provided by his
defection but also eyed him suspiciously because of his independent
streak and former Sandinista ties.
   Pastora survived a 1984 bomb explosion that killed four people,
including an American journalist, during a news conference in his
jungle hideout on the Costa Rican border.
   In 1986, the CIA withdrew financial support for Pastora and soon
after he quit the fight.

   A pet cemetery was vandalized, but its most
famous grave, that of Richard Nixon's beloved Checkers, was
untouched, authorities said.
   ``Mischievous kids'' struck at the Bide-A-Wee cemetery on Long
Island early Saturday and kicked over about 200 tombstones, said
police Officer Robert Feeley. Some were broken, he said.
   The tombstone of the cocker spaniel immortalized in a speech by
Nixon when he was a vice presidential candidate was among those
spared.
   In his 1952 ``Checkers'' speech, Nixon rebutted charges that he
illegally accepted gifts from wealthy supporters. He cited the
black-and-white dog, a supporter's gift to his family, as one
contribution he would keep. The family pet died in 1964 at age 12.
   No arrests were made in the vandalism. Feeley said the vandals
were lucky.
   ``None of the animals came back to life, like in `Pet Sematary,'
'' he said of the Stephen King story. ``But it would serve them
right if they did.''

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci says she fled
for the West without saying goodbye to her parents, and began her
journey with a cold, six-hour hike to Hungary during which she
risked arrest or worse.
   The Olympic champion has kept out of public sight since arriving
Friday in New York City and holding a brief news conference.
   An account of her escape to Hungary was published in a London
newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, which reportedly paid Comaneci for
the story.
   Comaneci endured a muddy, nighttime trek through country terrain
before reaching the Romanian border with Hungary, she said.
   ``I could not bring anything else with me, not even my precious
gold medals or a photograph of my family,'' she was quoted as
saying.
   She said she left without saying farewell to her parents.
   ``I could tell no one I was escaping,'' she said. ``I even had
to lie to my brother. I was frightened, of course I was. I was
scared of being picked up by the Romanian authorities.''
   The Mail said it interviewed Comaneci, 28, in New York on
Saturday night. Today's editions of USA Today quoted the Mail
reporter as saying Comaneci was paid for the interview. Patti Auer,
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Gymnastics Federation, said officials of
the organization had flown to New York to speak with Comaneci but
could not contact her.
   Auer said the federation wanted to set up a meeting between
Comaneci and her former coach, Bela Karolyi, who lives in Houston
and was scheduled to arrive in Chicago today from Europe.
   In the newspaper interview, Comaneci said she and a friend,
Konstantin Panit, left her parents' home in Bucharest in a rented
car Nov. 26 and headed for the town of Timisoara near the Hungarian
border.
   Six other friends also had crowded into the car, and Panit
dropped them off 10 miles from the Hungarian border at about
midnight, the newspaper quoted Comaneci as saying.
   ``We were stumbling and often crawling through water and ice,''
Comaneci said.
   She said the group encountered no border guards although they
heard their dogs barking.
   ``We didn't even think what would happen if we were caught
alive. It almost certainly would have meant going to prison in
Romania,'' she said.
   They reached the border after walking for six hours, having
veered miles off their planned route, Comaneci told the Mail.
   The group was stopped by a Hungarian border patrol and taken to
police headquarters at Szeged, Hungary, the newspaper said. Early
Wednesday, the group left Hungary for Austria.
   Comaneci's defection, the Mail said, was arranged by Panit.
Romanian exiles said Comaneci would initially stay with Panit and
his family in southern Florida.
   Other news accounts have said Comaneci might go to Houston,
where Karolyi lives, or Indianapolis, the gymnastics federation
headquarters.
   Comaneci gained international fame at age 14 when she became the
first gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics, an
achievement she repeated seven times at the 1976 games in Montreal.

   ARRIVE is a school that pays students $10 just
to show up, but there are two requirements for admission: recent
release from jail and a history of intravenous drug abuse.
   The program works to develop a social-services network to help
its students get back into society _ and get what they need if they
develop AIDS.
   ``The primary purpose of the program is to stop the transmission
(of AIDS), but to do that you have to help people get their lives
together,'' said Dr. Harry K. Wexler, program director for ARRIVE _
a loose acronym for AIDS Risk Reduction and Education for Former
Intravenous Drug Abusers Entering Society.
   Still, ARRIVE classes, which meet three nights a week, cover far
more than AIDS awareness.
   ``I want us to quickly identify some of the things that stress
us out,'' Clinical Director Howard Josepher told a class of about
25 people, mostly black men, who had gathered one night in a Lower
Manhattan office building.
   ``Trying to deal with life now without the use of drugs,''
responded one man with a graying goatee. ``It has been so long.''
   ``Dealing with your children when they're young,'' said another,
to a chorus of agreement.
   ``Dealing with a crack son,'' said a woman.
   In the beginning, few women enrolled. Now one of the 24 classes
deals specifically with women and AIDS.
   In the early days, the cookies didn't last through the evening;
the organizers learned some students had nothing else to eat. At
least one showed up directly from jail, suitcase in hand.
   ARRIVE has evolved in another way, too. It has become something
of an advocacy force for a high-risk population without a voice.
   Since the start of 1988, intravenous drug users have accounted
for more of the AIDS cases reported in the city than any other
group. In an anonymous random sampling, about 35 percent of state
prison inmates tested HIV-positive.
   ARRIVE helps students draw up resumes and look for jobs,
especially in drug and AIDS counseling. It gives out subway tokens,
and offers a 24-hour source of support, even to those who return to
drugs.
   ``We have to deal with the fact that they're going to experiment
and they will be pulled back into old behaviors,'' said Josepher.
   Sometimes the streets win. Thirty-seven percent of those who
entered ARRIVE didn't graduate, according to figures from its first
five groups of students. Dropout figures aren't available for its
two most recent groups, including one that graduated Friday.
   Some graduates get stipends to help others through the program.
In August, one helper was shot to death in Harlem.
   Many students left jail to find the streets changed _ filled
with younger faces and more violence revolving around crack.
   ``I've gotten a lot of feedback from our students that they feel
like outsiders,'' said Joseph Turner, an ARRIVE trainer.
``Producing a lot of discomfort for people who've had a history of
substance abuse will drive them back to the drug.''
   Those who stick it out are often people who've shown their
strength before. Earl Ray got himself off speedballs, a mixture of
heroin and cocaine, at age 24. At 30, he was ordered imprisoned for
nine years for manslaughter; once inside, he sent himself back to
school.
   Now, he works for Narcotic and Drug Research Inc., which runs
ARRIVE, going to prisons to recruit prospective students. He lives
with a sister who's on crack. His brother is an intravenous drug
user.
   ``I knew that I would either come back out here and be part of
the problem or part of the solution,'' Ray said.
   Jenny Melendez, 35, freed herself from a whirlpool of cocaine,
alcohol and compulsive gambling.
   ``I used to gamble my food stamps,'' she said. She joined ARRIVE
with her husband, who is in a drug-rehabilitation program. At home,
she tells their six children, ages 4 months to 16 years, what she
learns at ARRIVE.
   ``I want to go to school and teach children about AIDS,'' she
said. ``I want to spread what I learned.''
   ARRIVE is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and
the students are part of an experiment that will compare them with
other ex-cons who get less treatment or no treatment at all. All
told, a research subject can earn $280 for completing the program.
   It's enough to bring people in but not enough to keep them, says
Wexler. ``People who don't get motivated, who don't get connected,
they just leave.''
   It helps that the teachers know well where the students have
been. Josepher says he and Turner spent time in jail and used drugs.
   ``One of the main problems in the beginning is imparting to them
visions of hope,'' said Turner.
   ``I've got to teach them about self-respect,'' said Josepher.
``I've got to help them to see that they're self-destructive and
this translates into anger directed at themselves.''

   Tropical Storm Karen has dissipated after a cold
front moved into the northwest Caribbean, forecasters said today.
   Miles Lawrence of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables said a hurricane reconnaissance flight found that the
storm had weakened.
   Over the weekend, Karen lingered off the coast of Central
America with 40 mph winds, barely tropical-storm strength.
   The system surprised forecasters by building to tropical-storm
strength Thursday, the final day of the six-month Atlantic
hurricane season. On Friday, top winds reached 55 mph.
   The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but
hurricanes have been recorded in every month except April.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A memorial service is planned Thursday for Eddie
Balchowsky, a pianist, artist and poet who lost an arm in the
Spanish Civil War.
   Balchowsky, 73, was killed Wednesday when he either jumped or
fell in front of a train on Chicago's North Side, authorities said.
   Police said witnesses reported that Balchowsky jumped, but
several of his friends said he was under heavy medication and may
have lost his balance.
   ``To me he was Lazarus,'' said Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Studs Terkel. ``Eddie had lived about seven different lives. A
number of times we thought he had died and he'd show up again,
usually with younger and younger girls.''
   In 1937, Balchowsky sailed to Spain to fight on the Loyalist
side in the Spanish Civil War. His recordings of songs during that
time were featured as part of a television documentary, ``The Good
Fight.''
   A machine gun bullet shattered his right arm shortly after he
arrived to fight with other Americans in the Abraham Lincoln
Brigade, said his longtime friend Charles Shields. The arm
eventually had to be amputated.
   He did paintings that were almost surrealistic in nature, and
once had a one-man show at the Art Institute of Chicago, Shields
said Sunday.
   Balchowsky, who played piano accompaniment for folk singer Pete
Seeger and the late black singer and actor Paul Robeson, continued
his painting and music until his death.
   Balchowsky is survived by his two daughters, Elizabeth and
Renya, and two grandchildren.

<HEAD>Report: More Than a Third of U.S. Hospitals Fail Quality Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital patients face a greater risk of
infection or inappropriate surgery because many hospitals aren't
meeting quality standards, according to the head of a group that
monitors health-care facilities.
   More than a third of U.S. hospitals failed to meet quality
standards designed to guard against inappropriate surgery,
unnecessary blood transfusions and poorly coordinated treatment in
special coronary and intensive-care units, according to a report in
Sunday's Chicago Tribune.
   The report also found that more than 40 percent of hospitals
were cited for violations of safety standards, ranging from
inadequate electrical wiring to improper disposal of hazardous
waste.
   The report was based on surveys of 5,208 facilities collected
from 1986 to 1988 by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, which sets quality standards for
health-care facilities.
   The Chicago-based commission said it had not analyzed the data
to determine how many violations were major.
   But the commission's president, Dr. Dennis O`Leary, said,
``Compliance problems mean that there is a greater risk of a bad
outcome, such as infection in the hospital, or a transfusion
reaction or a surgical misadventure.
   ``We consider that to be serious,'' he said.
   O'Leary said more and more hospitals are letting their buildings
run down because of financial pressures. ``Do hospitals have
adequate resources to really comply with the standards? Maybe
not,'' O'Leary said.
   The Tribune reported that the commission found that:
   _Fifty-one percent of hospitals did not have adequate procedures
for reviewing surgery to determine whether it should have been done
and whether it was done correctly.
   _Fifty-six percent did not properly monitor and evaluate how
well the medical staff in different departments gave care.
   _Fifty percent did not properly monitor what happened to
patients in special intensive-care and coronary-care units.
   _Thirty-five percent did not always review blood transfusion
procedures to determine whether a patient needed a transfusion and
whether whole blood or blood components should have been used.
   Blood components carry less risk of infection from viruses that
cannot be detected by current screening tests, such as hepatitis C.
   About five-sixths of the nation's hospitals are surveyed by the
Joint Commission, whose seal of approval qualifies them to get
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements without an extra government
inspection.
   Barry Bader, a quality consultant based in Rockville, Md., said
the pattern of problems indicated that physicians are increasingly
reluctant to review each other's care in the hospital, either
because of the time required or the fear of lawsuits.
   That doesn't mean patients are getting poor care, only that
hospitals often are uninformed about what kind of care they are
giving, Bader said.
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Public
Citizen Health Research Group, said the commission should publicly
disclose its compliance data for individual hospitals.
   ``If you're going to be a regulatory agency, you have to let the
public know what you're finding,'' Wolfe said.

   Borders to the West opened
today and Czechs and Slovaks crossed over them by the thousands as
their country's Communist authorities allowed the first
unrestricted travel in decades.
   ``Maybe this is truly freedom,'' said Stanislaw Balaz, who drove
through the Bratislava-Berg crossing with his wife and 14-year-old
daughter en route to Vienna, 42 miles away.
   The new open-border policy took effect at midnight. Balaz's car
was among more than 100 lined up at the crossing when the
Czechoslovak and Austrian border guards shook hands, then opened
the barrier at 12:04 a.m.
   Czechoslovak border guards reported a relatively light flow of
traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings to Austria throughout the
morning _ probably a reflection of today being a regular working
day.
   Austrian border officials said about 900 Czechoslovak cars had
passed through the Bratislava-Berg crossing by noon.
   At other crossings, the number of Czechoslovaks traveling to
Austria was much smaller.
   ``Instead of a storm, just a breeze,'' the Austria Press Agency
headlined a report, referring to the unexpectedly low number of
visitors.
   The news agency said most of the Czechoslovaks were sightseeing
and few had enough convertible currency for shopping.
   However, for those who had lined up at the Bratislava-Berg
crossing, the mood was ebullient as the barrier lifted.
   ``This is an indescribable feeling,'' said Jan Spurny, 25, as he
and his brother, Dusan, drove their yellow Wartburg sedan onto
Austrian territory.
   Television lights and a small crowd of well-wishers with a sign
reading ``Welcome to Austria'' greeted the new arrivals.
   The Communist government announced Thursday that all obstacles
to travel to the West would be removed. It was among the
concessions granted after weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of people.
   The move came after the East German government, spurred by
similar mass protests, announced nearly one month ago that it was
opening its Western borders, including the Berlin Wall.
   In Czechoslovakia, travel regulations introduced in 1987 had
made visits to the West easier for Czechoslovaks than for most
citizens of other Soviet-bloc countries, but there were still
formidable bureaucratic obstacles.
   Before the borders opened today, those seeking to go West needed
a passport. They also needed authorization from the police, from
their workplace or school and in some cases from local Communist
Party officials to get an exit visa. They also had to have
invitations from relatives or friends in the West.
   Now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief
questionnaire giving their names, addresses, the country they will
visit and the duration of their stay.
   Only one Czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the Bratislava-Berg
crossing of a two-lane road when the first Austria-bound cars
arrived about 10 p.m.
   Dusan Spurney, 22, said, ``I'm just going to drive across and
then drive right back. I just want to see if it works.''

   Anyone brave or foolish enough to
venture outside in the country's swankiest district was a target.
   Even nuns were shot at in Makati today, where fighting between
rebel and loyalist soldiers pinned down hundreds of foreigners for
a third day. Insurgent snipers had sheltered themselves in
apartment buildings and hotels.
   Canadian Ambassador Andre Simard said the rebels were using
Americans, Japanese and others as ``human shields'' in their
flagging 4-day-old coup attempt.
   At least three people were reported slain in Makati today and 15
wounded, including one American, in the fighting. Earlier,
spokesmen for the Makati Medical Center said 10 people were killed.
They said the discrepancy was due to an error in records.
   Hundreds of rebel soldiers swarmed into Makati's commercial
district Saturday, turning about 20 luxury hotels and high-rise
apartment and office complexes into snipers' dens.
   They shot at anyone venturing outside.
   ``Literally, we're in the middle,'' said Barbara Julich, a New
York businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. ``(We're)
now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is no
baby food, and the mothers are hysterical.
   ``We saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks
are. They were eventually shot at and took cover.''
   Jerry Huchel, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy, estimated 210
Americans in three luxury hotels in the battle area. He said that
did not include scores of other Americans who may be living in
expensive apartments nearby.
   ``It's not a hostage situation, (but) ``they just can't leave,''
he said.
   The presence of the foreigners and residents has prevented
government forces from waging an assault to wipe out the last
pockets of resistance, and officials believe the standoff could
last for days.
   Ambassador Simard blamed the rebels for keeping the foreigners
in the area, home to the country's two stock exchanges and its most
exclusive boutiques. ``They're certainly using these people as
human shields, in my view,'' he said.
   Electricity was cut briefly today after a stray bullet knocked
out a transformer.
   The Japanese newspaper Asahi said all 600 guests at the Nikko
Manila Garden Hotel were herded into the basement Sunday when
rebels entered the building to demand food. It was not clear if
they were still there.
   Asahi said about 300 Japanese were trapped in Makati hotels and
another 300 were living in apartments in the area.
   ``My advice to them is to stay away from windows, stay in your
room and keep good courage,'' said West German Ambassador Peter
Scholz. ``We have to live out this phase.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Identified as Suspect In Lockerbie Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UPPSALA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish court today identified a
Palestinian living in Sweden as a suspect in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 and approved the seizure of evidence during a raid on
his apartment last week.
   The District Court, granting a request by Scottish detectives to
authorize the seizure of 15 bags of clothing, said it found
Mohammed Abo Talb ``is suspected in Scotland of murder or as an
accessory to murder.''
   The court said the clothing taken one week ago from Abo Talb's
apartment ``can be presumed to carry significance for the
investigation'' and the seizure was therefore legal.
   It was believed to be the first time a suspect has faced a court
proceeding for the explosion Dec. 21, 1988 of the Pan Am flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
   Abo Talb, 35, was in jail awaiting a verdict on separate charges
of murder and attempted murder for complicity in a series of bomb
attacks in Scandinavia and Holland in 1985 and 1986. One bomb in
Copenhagen killed one person and wounded more than 20.
   Abo Talb, a former activist in the Palestine Popular Struggle
Front group, was linked to Flight 103 when it was established that
he was in Malta two months before the explosion.
   Investigators reportedly traced clothing bought in Malta to the
suitcase which they believe also contained the bomb.
   The pressure-sensitive bomb apparently was transported in the
suitcase from Malta to Frankfurt, where it was put on board the New
York-bound flight, according to the investigators' reported theory.
   Seven Swedish policemen and three Scottish detectives raided Abo
Talb's apartment last Monday, apparently searching for clothing
that could be linked to the shreds found in Lockerbie.
   On Friday, the public prosecutor, acting on behalf of the
Scottish detectives, asked the court to sanction the seizure as
legal.
   Under Swedish law, evidence taken for a police investigation
outside Sweden must be authorized by a court. The court also must
approve its removal from the country.
   The decision, which was printed and distributed at the
courthouse by a clerk, said that any property removed from Sweden
must be returned at the end of the investigation.
   It also confirmed a previous decision to classify the court
records in the case as secret.
   Jamila Mograbi, Abo Talb's ex-wife who still lives with him,
said detectives took all the family's clothing, and she said she
had to borrow clothes from friends for herself and her two children.
   Speaking to reporters on Friday, she said the policemen
searching the apartment questioned her for one hour and that she
was called to an Uppsala police station later in the week for
further interrogation.
   According to court documents, Abo Talb was born in Lebanon,
served in the Egyptian army and underwent training in the Soviet
Union in handling anti-aircraft missiles.
   He deserted in 1970 to join the Popular Struggle Front, a
radical offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He
returned to the Soviet Union for further training in 1980.
   Abo Talb immigrated to Sweden in 1986.

   Premier Hans Modrow, who is emerging as East

   Many see Modrow, 61, as East Germany's equivalent to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose domestic programs of greater
openness and economic restructuring caught on among the East German
public.
   Modrow was elected premier, or head of government, on Nov. 14
after years of waiting as local party leader in Dresden. He was
named today to handle any Communist Party issues that arise during
the current Warsaw Pact summit in Moscow.
   It was also Modrow's duty to inform the edgy Moscow leadership
about the growing upheaval in East Germany, where the Soviets have
nearly 400,000 troops.
   Despite the clear signs of ascent, it is still too early to
predict who will finally come out on top as East Germany goes
through widespread and seemingly uncontrollable changes.
   The Communist Party, which still counts an estimated 2 million
members, is preparing for an emergency session on Dec. 15-17 that
will elect a new leadership. But even then, with party support
dropping and a greater risk of a breakup, the Communists' future is
increasingly clouded.
   Modrow himself has been among those giving a gloomy assessment
of the party's chances, saying the Communists would get no more
than 20 percent of the vote if promised free elections were held
today.
   The premier, in his inaugural speech to Parliament on Nov. 17,
appealed for more private enterprise to help rescue the country's
troubled economy.
   Modrow said East Germany is ``open for proposals on joint
ventures, investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot
projects,'' all of which address some of the concerns of Western
businesses looking for openings in the East German market.
   He called for a ``better socialism'' with more supplies of
consumer goods for the nation's 16.5 million people. He rejected
talk of German reunification as ``dangerous and unrealistic'' while
calling for increased treaty links between the two countries.
   Long known as an anti-establishment Communist, Modrow was the
target of an inquisition led by then hard-line leader Erich
Honecker.
   The attacks temporarily derailed his career as a nationwide
leader, forcing him to stay as local party chief in his power base
of Dresden.
   In June, central authorities singled him out for rare public
criticism, saying he had failed to control ``bourgeois and enemy
views'' in Dresden after a large demonstration of citizens
demanding freedom of travel to the West.
   An engineer by trade and the holder of a university economics
degree, Modrow already has wielded far more clout as premier than
his colorless predecessor, Willi Stoph.
   Many East Germans as well as Soviet officials made plain they
would have preferred Modrow in the post of Communist Party
secretary, but the job went to Honecker protege Egon Krenz on Oct.
18.
   As 10,000 demonstrators rallied in East Berlin on Sunday, many
carried placards saying all of the top Communist leaders should
quit except Modrow.
   With Krenz now out, that leaves open the possibility for a
Modrow shot at the top party job _ if the structure stays the same.
There are already growing warnings about a possible breakup of the
troubled party, while many say a name change at least is possible.
   Married and the father of two children, Modrow began his party
career as chief of the Communist youth organization in East Berlin
from 1953 to 1961. He won election to the 163-member Central
Committee in 1967 and became Dresden party secretary in 1973.
   Modrow won massive support in Dresden, in part because he
rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
His wife reportedly waited in lines at stores like other local
homemakers.
   The premier stunned East Berliners by walking home, rather than
being driven, after his Nov. 17 speech in Parliament.

   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia today pounded two Shiite Moslem towns with artillery fire,
killing four people and wounding 18, police said.
   The bombardment, just north of Israel's self-designated security
zone, coincided with renewed fighting between the two main Shiite
militia factions in the southern villages of Sohmor and Yohmor.
   Police said at least 20 people were killed or wounded in the
hostilities between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Amal militia. The police report did not provide a casualty
breakdown.
   There was no word on what touched off the Hezbollah-Amal
fighting.
   The two factions are locked in a 2{-year-old struggle for
control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the country's
largest single sect.
   By police count, at least 535 people have been killed and 1,490
wounded in Amal-Hezbollah clashes since May 1987.
   Today was the third consecutive day the towns of Nabatiyeh and
neighboring Kfar Rumman, which have a combined population of
140,000, have come under SLA artillery fire. Five people have been
killed and 38 wounded in the violence.
   The SLA said in a statement broadcast by its Voice of The South
radio station that the bombardment was in retaliation for assaults
by Shiite guerrillas Saturday and Sunday in which three SLA
militiamen were killed and five wounded.
   The Lebanese government instructed U.N. Ambassador Rashid
Fakhoury to lodge a complaint with the Security Council about the
SLA attacks.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said the Lebanese government
reserved the right to ask for a Security Council debate of ``the
brutal attacks by Israel and its surrogates in south Lebanon.''
   The SLA and Israeli troops patrol Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone. Israel carved out the area in 1985 when it withdrew
the bulk of its occupation army from Lebanon.
   The enclave, designed to serve as a buffer against cross-border
raids into northern Israel, covers 328 square miles.

   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who spent 25 months in
jail for refusing to allow her daughter to visit the child's
father, was married over the weekend to a federal appeals court
judge.
   Morgan married Paul R. Michel, a judge on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, at St. Alban's Church on the
grounds of the Washington National Cathedral on Saturday, one of
her attorneys, Adrian Roe, said today.
   Morgan was jailed in August 1987 for civil contempt of court for
refusing to produce her daughter Hilary, now 7, for an unsupervised
visit with her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, a northern
Virginia oral surgeon.
   Morgan, a plastic surgeon, has contended that Foretich sexually
abused the child _ an allegation he repeatedly has denied.
   Neither Morgan's parents nor Hilary were at the wedding. Her
parents have not been seen since the child disappeared.
   Robert Morgan said his sister and Michel did not reveal their
honeymoon plans, even to family members. It was the second marriage
for both.

<HEAD>Airport Foes Clash With Police at Planned Construction Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a radical leftist group hurled firebombs
and stones today at riot police trying to remove huts built
illegally on the site of a proposed new runway at Tokyo's
international airport, police said.
   Police fought back with water cannons, but there were no reports
of injuries, said an offical of the Chiba Prefectural Police,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said Masaaki Komurasaki, a 27-year-old member of
the Battle Flag leftist group, was arrested for allegedly
constructing a tower on the construction site.
   About five people atop the tower, which was several yards high,
threw firebombs and stones as riot police moved in with bulldozers
and backhoes to get rid of about 10 huts built inside and near the
site of the planned runway, officials said.
   Local farmers and their supporters, including radicals seizing
on the issue for their anti-government activities, have been
resisting the government's plans to expropriate farmland to expand
the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, which opened in 1978
with just one runway.
   Complaints of congestion have been growing, and the government
plans to complete construction of another 8,250-foot runway within
next year.
   Today marked the start of police action to clear the huts.
   The official said 5,000 riot police were mobilized to block off
the area.
   Another 1,500 riot police are to be mobilized to strengthen
checkpoints on roads leading to the airport, he added.
   About 230 opponents, including members of the Chukakuha, another
radical group opposed to the airport, are living in huts and other
structures there, police sources said.
   The Transport Ministry says eight farmers still live inside the
planned expansion site.
   Transport Minister Takami Eto told a news conference he had
apologized to local farmers for the government's choosing Narita as
the airport site, ministry officials said.
   Eto said his apology was contained in a letter mailed Saturday
in reply to a protest letter sent by some farmers.
   Eto, the first transport minister to make such an official
apology to farmers, said he would like to have talks with farmers
opposing the airport, the officials added.

   Opposition leaders urged people to
stage mass demonstrations today to protest a new Cabinet that did
not meet their demands. Thousands of Czechs and Slovaks poured
across the nation's newly opened borders.
   The opposition Civic Forum also threatened a general strike to
protest the government named Sunday. All but five of the new
Cabinet's 21 members are Communists; 11 members, including Premier
Ladislav Adamec, are holdovers.
   Civic Forum denounced the appointments and called for new
protests today on Wenceslas Square, the center of two weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations that forced the Communists to bow to
demands for reform.
   There were no demonstrations by early afternoon.
   In the past nine days, the Communist Party has seen its 41-year
monopoly on power removed from the constitution, been forced to
oust hard-line leaders and reversed 21 years of policy by admitting
that 1968's Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform was a mistake.
   Today the government lifted virtually all restrictions on
foreign travel, and border guards reported a light but steady flow
of traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings into Austria. It was
the first unrestricted travel in decades.
   ``Maybe this is truly freedom,'' said Stanislaw Balaz, who drove
through the Bratislava-Berg crossing with his wife and 14-year-old
daughter en route to Vienna, 42 miles away.
   The open-border policy took effect at midnight, and by noon
about 3,000 Czechoslovaks had crossed into Austria. Border guards
said traffic may have been relatively light because today was a
workday. Lack of hard cash might also have kept travel light.
   Striking students, whose protests of police brutality at a Nov.
17 demonstration sparked Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolt, greeted
radio reports on the Cabinet with derisive laughter at their
headquarters.
   They dropped plans to end the strike and return to classes today.
   The call for a new protest and Civic Forum's general objections
to the new government were printed in state-run dailies. Only one
newspaper, the trade union daily Prace, carried the threat of a
general strike.
   Peter Miller, a Civic Forum spokesman at Prague's CKD heavy
industry factory, said there would be a general strike next Monday
unless a new government is announced by Dec. 10.
   ``It's the only way for citizens to show what they want,'' said
Miller, one of several opposition representatives interviewed on
state television.
   Theater director Miroslav Machacek, representing striking
actors, said artists were ready to back a general strike.
   ``We have to fight to the end, until we are certain that the
path to freedom in this country is irreversible,'' he said.
   Strike committees at enterprises nationwide have remained on
alert since last week, when millions followed an opposition call to
strike for two hours to show they reject one-party rule.
   The next day, Adamec agreed to drop the Communist Party's
leading role from the constitution and form the first coalition
government in 21 years.
   Petr Pithart, a Civic Forum representative, said the opposition
wants to replace Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes, a holdover
criticized for his defense of harsh human rights policies, and
Energy Minister Antonin Krumnikl, held responsible for widespread
pollution.
   The opposition also seeks new laws that would guarantee
democratic rights of assembly, association and a free press, and
pave the way for free elections.
   First Deputy Premier Bohumil Urban, in announcing the new
government team at a news conference, said ``all the demands of
Civic Forum could not yet at this stage be respected.''
   Some of the unmet demands included a civilian defense minister
and a non-communist head of the Interior Ministry, which is in
charge of police.
   The five non-Communists included three people without party
affiliation, and one person each from the Socialist and People's
parties, traditionally allied with the Communists but more
independent in recent months.
   Josef Hromadka, a high-ranking leader of Czechoslovakia's
Protestant church, became one of seven deputy premiers.
   Communist authorities have traditionally kept a tight rein on
religion, exercising veto power over all church appointments in
this nation, which is 65 percent Roman Catholic.
   Gen. Miroslav Vacek became defense minister, and Communist
Frantisek Pinc, a political unknown who had served as director of a
nuclear power station, was named interior minister.
   At its first meeting, the new government condemned the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion and appointed Johanes to negotiate with Moscow
on the future of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in
Czechoslovakia since.
   The move was clearly intended to try to gain suport from a
population that was horrified by the invasion and hated the leaders
installed by Moscow afterwards to crush the ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   The last of those leaders left in power is President Gustav
Husak, who indicated as he swore in the new Cabinet on Sunday that
he may step down.
   ``I don't have any ambitions to remain in my function,'' he
said, according to the state news agency CTK. He added, however,
that a decision to quit would come only after consultations between
political and oppposition groups.
   The opposition has demanded his resignation by next Sunday.
   Adamec, Johanes and Communist Party chief Karel Urbanek left
Sunday for Moscow, where Warsaw Pact leaders are meeting.
   Each country that took party in the 1968 invasion has now
officially criticized its participation.

   Who's a Who?
   That's the question the editors of ``Who's Who in America'' must
decide as they prepare listings for the 1990-91 edition of the
reference book.
   Actor Eric Roberts will be listed in the new Who's Who. But Mr.
T, star of the canceled ``A-Team'' TV series, will not be. Baseball
slugger Jose Canseco of the Oakland A's is a Who, but National
League rookie of the year, Jerome Walton, the Chicago Cubs
centerfielder, is not.
   ``Walton was rookie of the year, true,'' explained John L.
Daniels, product manager for Who's Who In America. ``But you don't
know. What about his sophomore year? What if he fizzles?''
   Once someone is listed, it's for life, until retirement, until
someone asks to be left out or until conviction for a serious
crime, Daniels said.
   Sometimes the editors look the other way at a conviction, as in
the case of Watergate convicts John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman and
Charles Colson, who continue to be listed.
   Thousands of questionnaires were mailed this fall from Who's Who
headquarters in this northern Chicago suburb to Nobel laureates,
federal judges, movie stars, Fortune 500 company officials,
newspaper editors, junior partners in major accounting firms,
up-and-coming lawyers, and others.
   Researchers at the headquarters comb through newspapers,
magazines and corporate reports for prospective listees.
   ``We try to be as objective as we can be in our standards,''
Daniels said. ``We try to quantify quality.''
   Those who return the questionnaires, providing information about
their accomplishments, memberships, education and the like, are
guaranteed a place among the 79,000 people to be listed in the new
edition, due out in September 1990.
   Daniels said the expected return rate is only 12 percent to 14
percent. Years ago, as many as 20 percent returned the
questionnaires.
   He said the rate has dropped because people are confused by the
proliferation of such books _ many of them vanity press
publications that charge for a listing.
   In contrast, ``Who's Who in America,'' a publication of
Macmillan Inc., makes clear in its preface that its entries don't
have to buy the book.
   Daniels said he receives up to 50 unsolicited nominations for
new entrants each week _ either from admirers or the would-be
personalities themselves.
   The publication has been in business since 1899. New editions
are published every two years.
   Albert Nelson Marquis, a Chicago publisher, founded the
publication after seeing a similar book in Britain. The idea was
not to confer celebrity status on certain people, but to provide a
useful reference book to businesses and libraries.
   The book does have a history of keeping a Who or two out.
   Frank Lloyd Wright was refused a listing for years because
Marquis objected to the architect's unsettled married life.
   Marquis also barred 1930s Hollywood star Mae West from the big
red book. That prompted her to respond, ``Well, the old boy who
publishes that isn't in my little black book, either.''

   A U.S. Army helicopter carrying 16
soldiers and a crew of three crashed into a remote mountainside
south of Seoul today, but only minor injuries were reported,
officials said.
   The CH-47D Chinook transport helicopter was on a training
mission when it crashed near Osan City, 40 miles south of Seoul, at
about 10:30 a.m., said Air Force Sgt. Wilt Baker of the 8th U.S.
Army public affairs office.
   The injured were treated at nearby hospitals, he said. Their
names were withheld.
   The helicopter was assigned to B Company, 2nd Battalion, 501st
Aviation Regiment stationed at Camp Humphreys south of Seoul.
American military officials said they were investigating the cause
of the crash.
   The Army grounded most of its CH-47D Chinook helicopters in
October because of a problem with transmission oil cooling fans.
The fleet was grounded in August as a precaution while previous fan
failures were studied.
   The helicopters were made by Boeing Helicopter Co.

   A black man was killed and at
least 13 people, including eight policemen and a Parliament member,
were hurt when officers clashed with hundreds of blacks trying to
attend a protest meeting, police said today.
   Constables were pelted with stones and responded by using stun
grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas, policesaid.
   The clash occurred Sunday in Edendale, near the Natal Province
capital of Pietermaritzburg, after more than 2,000 blacks gathered
to attend an anti-government meeting.
   Authorities had refused to allow the meeting to be held at a
stadium, and it was moved to a meeting hall that could accommodate
only about 1,000 people.
   Police said those who could not fit inside became disorderly and
began stoning officers and their vehicles. The police report did
not specify how the death occurred.
   One of those injured was Pierre Cronje, a white Parliament
member for the anti-apartheid Democratic Party. He was hit in the
chest by a rock but not seriously hurt.
   Five other deaths were reported in political violence and
faction fighting elsewhere in Natal in the 24 hours ending at
daybreak today. More than 2,000 blacks have been killed in the
province in the past three years in a power truggle between members
of Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization, and
supporters of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition.
   The meeting in Edendale was organized by supporters of the front.

<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes edged down 0.5 percent in
October, the sixth monthly decline of the year but a major
improvement over the previous month, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649,000 units in October,
after a 10.2 percent plunge in September.
   The September decrease was revised downward from a 14 percent
fall originally reported last month.
   Fixed-rate mortgage interest rates fell to 9.82 percent by the
end of October after rising into the double digits in September.
Analysts had said the lower rates would lead to an improvement in
the housing industry.
   The National Association of Realtors reported last week that
sales of existing homes remained steady in October at their highest
level since last January and NAR chief economist John A. Tuccillo
said then that ``home financing conditions probably will stay quite
favorable in the months ahead.''
   The housing industry was among the hardest hit when the Federal
Reserve pumped up interest rates last year to slow the economy and
thus contain inflation. But as inflationary pressures cooled, the
Fed has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the beginning of
the summer.
   The Realtors association reported today that its index measuring
the ability of the typical American family to buy an existing home
rose in October to its highest level in eight months because of
stable rates and a drop in the median home price.
   The real estate group said the index rose to 106.1, from 103.5
in September and the highest since it measured 106.7 last February.
That means a family with a median income of $33,365 had 106.1
percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home
costing $92,100.
   The median means that half of the families earn more and half
less, or that half the homes sell for more and half for less.
   The Commerce Department report today said the median price of a
new home was $127,900 in October, up 5.3 percent from $121,500 in
September. The average price of a new home was unchanged at
$151,900.
   New-home sales for the first nine months were down 4.4 percent
from the same period in 1988.
   Sales rose 47.8 percent in the Northeast but fell 24.7 percent
in the West. The South posted a 5.7 percent increase, while the
Midwest recorded a 3.7 percent gain.
   The Realtors, meanwhile, said a family in the Northeast earning
the median income of $37,329 had only 76.1 percent of the income
needed to buy median-priced existing home costing $143,300.
   In the West, a family earning the median income of $35,299 had
74.1 percent of the income needed to buy a home priced at $142,200.
   In the South, a family earning the median income of $30,533 had
107.4 percent of the income needed to buy an $83,400 home, while a
Midwestern family earning the median of $33,511 had 137.5 percent
of the income needed to purchase a home priced at $70,900.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will fly
to Berlin next week to visit the Berlin Wall and make a major
speech on U.S. foreign policy, State Department spokesman Margaret
D. Tutwiler said today.
   On the one-day trip next Tuesday, Baker probably will also go to
Bonn, the West German capital, for further talks with leaders of
the government, the spokeswoman said.
   Although the invitation to speak before the Berlin Press Club
was on Baker's desk for several weeks, his decision to except
represents more than a simple speaking engagement.
   The presence of the U.S. secretary of state in Berlin, which was
divided after World War II, could lend at least tacit sypport a
proposal by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl calling for the
reunification of Germany.
   Last week, Baker endorsed a proposal by Kohl for a step-by-step
process of reunification, beginning with the confederation of East
and West Germany even while the Bonn government remains in the NATO
alliance.
   On Sunday, U.S. ambassador to West Germany, Vernon A. Walters,
predicted the reunification of Germany would take place within five
years.
   Baker's travel plan is to set out from Washington next Monday
and spend Tuesday afternoon in Berlin, including a visit to the
Berlin Wall, crumbling as East Germany joins other Eastern European
nations in veering away from orthodox communism.
   Baker then will probably stop in Bonn and then go on to Brussels
to attend a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Ms. Tutwiler said.

   Prime Minister Zeid Bin Shaker resigned
today and King Hussein named his court chief, Mudar Badran, to form
a new government, official sources reported.
   The new Cabinet will have the task of negotiating with Jordan's
new Parliament, including Islamic fundamentalists, on legislation.
   An official at the prime minister's office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Bin Shaker, 55, a distant cousin of
the king, will take over as royal court chief.
   The appointment of Badran, 55, who has the reputation in the
Arab world of being a strong, persuasive politician, came as a
surprise. Most observers had expected Bin Shaker to stay on and
form a new Cabinet.
   Badran's appointment signaled concern over the deterioration in
Jordan's relations with neighboring Syria over Syria's military
occupation of Lebanon.
   The official told The Associated Press that a new Cabinet will
have to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament within 30 days.
   The new Cabinet will include former ministers, some members of
the royally appointed senate and some of the newly elected
80-member Chamber of Deputies, he said.
   Under Jordan's constitution, Bin Shaker's government had been
expected to resign following the Nov. 8 parliamentary elections,
the first nationwide poll in 22 years amid King Hussein's move
toward wider democracy.
   Bin Shaker formed his transitional government April 27 following
a wave of riots in southern Jordan over price hikes in basic food
commodities and fuel. At least nine people were killed.
   He was charged with overseeing the general elections and halting
a sharp slide in the economy that has cut per capita income from
$2,000 a year to about $1,200.
   Badran is known to sympathize with extremist Moslem factions,
including the Moslem Brotherhood movement, which won 25 seats in
Parliament in the recent elections. Nine other fundamentalists also
won the election.
   The new government will have to negotiate with the
fundamentalists to pass its own legislative program through
Parliament, which approves all laws and has the power to dismiss
prime ministers and their Cabinets.
   But ultimate authority remains in the hands of the king, who has
the power to dissolve Parliament and rule by decree.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Important Banking Industry Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an important banking
industry case, agreed today to decide whether U.S. banks with
branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign
governments seize or freeze those accounts.
   The court said it will review rulings that required Citibank to
pay depositors.
   Robert H. Bork, whose Supreme Court nomination was defeated by
the Senate in 1987, is representing Citibank.
   In the appeal acted on today, Bork said billions of dollars are
at stake. There are more than 900 branches of U.S. banks operating
in 73 countries, with some $225 billion in deposits.
   The case acted on today stems from economic troubles in the
Philippines in 1983.
   Wells Fargo Asia Limited in Singapore deposited $2 million with
the Citibank branch in Manila in June 1983. The money was to be
repaid with interest six months later.
   But on Oct. 15, 1983, the Philippine government of Ferdinand
Marcos, who was deposed and fled to Hawaii in 1986, froze the
accounts of foreign banks. The move prevented Citibank from
repaying the Manila deposits to Wells Fargo.
   Wells Fargo sued to recover the money, and Citibank later paid
it $934,000. Citibank withheld the balance of the original deposit.
   A federal judge in 1987 ordered Citibank to repay the balance in
1987, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling
last July.
   The appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks
that suggested Citibank's home office in New York City had the duty
to pay the money.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to review
Citibank's appeal in the Philippine case, and to rule in the bank's
favor. Justice Department lawyers offered their views at the
request of the high court.
   The case is Citibank vs. Wells Fargo, 88-1260.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed Afghan insurgents said
today that an Afghan army general and three guerrilla commanders
were killed in fighting outside that nation's eastern city of
Jalalabad.
   Guerrilla sources also claimed to have crushed a major offensive
by the communist government to retake strategic positions outside
Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   MIDIA, a news agency run by various guerrilla factions, reported
that Brig. Gen. Ghulam Haider was killed Saturday when Moslem
insurgents launched an artillery attack on army headquarters in
Jalalabad.
   Guerrillas said Haider was the third Afghan army general to be
killed in fighting in the past month.
   The guerrilla news agency claimed three government army officers
were captured and a fourth defected during fighting outside
Jalalabad.
   The insurgents have been trying for nine months to capture the
strategic city.
   The guerrillas also said three of their key commanders were
killed during the past week.
   They said Khalid, a commander who uses only one name, died when
he stepped on a mine outside Jalalabad while trying to retrieve the
bodies of some fighters killed in an earlier clash.
   Guerrilla sources said Khalid was a leader in offensives earlier
this year that eventually gave the insurgents control of the
45-mile strategic highway leading from Jalalabad to the Pakistan
border.
   The guerrilla news agency said commander Abdul Matin was hit in
an artillery attack near Rodat, about 24 miles west of the Pakistan
border.
   It said commander Zarab Gul Khomeni died along with five rebels
during a weekend attack on government positions near Surkhrud, six
miles west of Jalalabad.
   The city has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in
the guerrilla's 11-year-old war to overthrow successive communist
governments in Kabul.
   The insurgents began their battle for the city last March, about
three weeks after the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan. Their
departure ended nine years of Soviet military intervention.
   Kabul's ruling communists control most of Afghanistan's cities
and the insurgents control most of the countryside.
   The guerrilla news agency claimed that an estimated 3,000
government troops, led by Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Shahnawaz
Tanai, tried unsuccessfully to rout insurgents from posts at
Chakaray and Illajay, outside Kabul.
   The fighting, which reportedly was centered about 18 miles
southeast of Kabul, could not be independently confirmed.
   The guerrillas claimed they destroyed eight government military
vehicles and killed 45 soldiers before repulsing government troops.
They declined to say how many rebels were killed.
   The guerrilla news agency also said that fighters ringing Khost
used anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down a government transport
plane Saturday. The report did not say how many people were on
board but that all were killed.
   Insurgents have been fighting for months to capture Khost, about
18 miles west of Pakistan.
   The seven most powerful Afghan guerrilla groups are based in
Pakistan, which helps channel U.S.-supplied weapons to them. Moscow
arms the Afghan government.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Ruling on Hazardous Waste Shipments in Alabama
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that limits the power of states and their citizens to block
shipments of hazardous waste from other states.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Alabama
officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from
an abandoned Texas chemical refinery to Alabama.
   Alabama officials said they were denied a fair opportunity to
oppose the shipments.
   The plans for removing the waste to Alabama were approved by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the so-called Superfund
law of 1980, aimed at helping clean up toxic waste.
   The EPA included an abandoned Geneva Industries Inc.
petrochemical plant in Houston among priority sites to be cleaned
up. The site is contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
and other toxic chemicals.
   EPA officials in 1986, in cooperation with Texas officials,
approved removal of the waste to another location.
   Texas officials signed a contract with Chemical Waste Management
Inc. (CWM) to have 47,000 tons of the waste shipped to the
company's treatment facility in Emelle, Ala.
   Alabama officials, led by Gov. Guy Hunt, said they unlawfully
were denied a chance to participate in the process that led to the
selection of the Emelle facility.
   A federal judge temporarily blocked the shipment of the waste.
But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the judge in
April and permitted the waste to be deposited at the Alabama site.
   The appeals court noted that the Emelle facility is licensed by
Alabama and the federal government to handle such toxic wastes.
   The appeals court added that federal laws controlling disposal
of toxic substances ``ensure that CWM's toxic waste storage and
treatment facility poses the least possible risk to human health
and safety.''
   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the Constitution
and federal laws guarantee Alabama citizens and officials the
opportunity to express opposition to such shipments before they
take place.
   The Bush administration supported the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that the Superfund law was
amended in 1986 to bar challenges to clean-up decisions until after
the clean-up is completed.
   The law ``does not preclude'' challenges such as the one made by
the Alabama officials, the government said. It only delays them
``until after remedial action has been taken and thus (the law) is
clearly constitutional.''
   The case is Alabama vs. Enviromental Protection Agency, 89-378.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Hear California Water Supply Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear
arguments favoring states' rights and consider limiting the federal
government's power to control water used by hydroelectric dams.
   The court said it will hear a California appeal supported by
more than 40 states.
   The water-rights dispute pits the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission against California's Water Resources Control Board. The
Bush administration sided with the federal commission, and
environmentalists supported the state agency.
   The commission in 1983 licensed construction of a hydroelectric
power project on Rock Creek, a small tributary of the American
River near Placerville, Calif.
   The dam's owner, Rock Creek Limited Partnership, plans to
generate electric power and sell it to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
   The state water resources agency sought to limit the flow of
water over the dam by requiring that enough water continue flowing
in Rock Creek to assure survival of trout.
   But the federal commission in 1987 said it has exclusive control
over how much water should flow over the dam.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of
commission last June, saying the Federal Power Act ``strongly
suggests that Congress intended to vest final authority for the
regulation of hyrdroelectric power projects in federal hands.''
   The appeals court said that interpretation of the law is
supported by a 1946 Supreme Court ruling, which it said gave states
control over water distribution only for limited purposes _ for
irrigation and city water supplies.
   ``Congress intended federal law to pre-empt state regulation in
all aspects of hydropower projects save for the limited proprietary
exceptions specified'' in the law, the appeals court said.
   Permitting the state to limit water supplied to the dam ``could
jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project'' and undermine
the federal licensing authority, the 9th Circuit court added.
   California's appeal was supported by a friend-of-the-court legal
brief signed by the attorneys general of 43 other states. The only
states not signing were Maryland, New York, Virginia, Louisiana,
Ohio and Wisconsin.
   The 43 states said the appeals court ruling, if adopted
nationwide, would ``fundamentally alter state control of water
resources and eviscerate comprehensive state regulatory systems for
allocating water.''
   Leading environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society and the Sierra Club, said ``ill-conceived hyrdroelectric
development'' should not be shielded from state regulation.
   But administration lawyers urged the justices to reject any call
for what they said would be unworkable dual control over
hydroelectric projects.
   The case is California vs. FERC, 89-333.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Female Inmates in Kentucky Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that women in a Kentucky prison must receive a lawyer's help with
their appeals.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by officials
at the Kentucky Correctional Institution for Women who were ordered
to provide the equivalent of at least one half-time lawyer to
assist inmates.
   One of the issues the appeal raised was whether courts, without
finding past intentional sex bias, may order prison systems to
offer female inmates the same access to courts male inmates receive.
   Inmates at the women's prison in Peewee Valley, Ky., sued over
conditions there in 1980.
   The suit alleged, among other things, that the inmates did not
have adequate access to courts because the law library was inferior
to those available to male inmates at the Kentucky State
Penitentiary and the Kentucky State Reformatory.
   After a four-week trial in 1982, U.S. District Judge Edward H.
Johnstone in Louisville ruled that the state had violated female
inmates' equal-protection rights by not providing them with the
same court access as male inmates.
   He ordered state authorities to provide a library identical to
those at the two prisons for men, to increase the hours women could
use their prison library and to provide free legal help.
   Only that part of Johnstone's order calling for legal help was
appealed. It was upheld by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last April 10.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the prison officials
argued that the hiring of a part-time lawyer should not be required.
   ``There is no justification,'' the appeal said. ``There is no
formula ... (to) measure the success of this part-time attorney.
There are no limits to the assistance provided by counsel.''
   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by 13 states. They are Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho,
Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota,
Tennessee and Wyoming.
   The case is Wilson vs. Canterino, 89-464.

   A Coast Guard cutter ran aground
today in 6-foot waves off Michigan in Lake Superior, injuring at
least three crewmen and causing extensive damage, authorities
reported.
   Two helicopters and three cutters helped rescue the 50 crew
members who were forced to abandon the 180-foot Mesquite, said
Petty Officer Frank Jennings, a spokesman at the Coast Guard's
Great Lakes district office in Cleveland.
   Those flown to a hospital included a crew member with a broken
arm and one who apparently suffered a heart attack, according to
Jennings, who said the nature of the third injury was not
immediately available.
   The other crew members were put aboard a commercial vessel, the
Mengal Desai, Jennings said.
   The World War II-vintage cutter, a buoy tender based in
Charlevoix, Mich., hit a submerged ledge at 2:30 a.m. about
three-fourths of a mile off Keweenaw Point near Copper Harbor in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Jennings said.
   ``She started taking on water and that flooded a number of
compartments,'' said Coast Guard Lt. John Andrzejewski in Sault
Ste. Marie. Andrzejewski said the ship came to rest on a sloping
rock ledge but appeared stable.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Lawsuit Against Harry Helmsley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
lawsuit against billionaire hotel owner Harry Helmsley and others
accused of fraud in a major New York City condominium conversion
project.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that Helmsley
and the others may be sued under a federal anti-racketeering law.
   Helmsley, his business partners and an engineering firm are
being sued by tenants of the Parkchester apartment complex in the
Bronx in New York City. The lawsuit said the defendants concealed
structural defects in the buildings, the presence of asbestos in
insulation and the need to replace electrical systems and plumbing.
   They are charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January said the
charges against the defendants, if true, constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined by the RICO statute.
   The Supreme Court last July ordered the appeals court to restudy
that decision after the justices themselves handed down a similar
ruling in a Minnesota telephone rates case.
   The high court said the RICO act can apply to even a single
fraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing illegal
activities. The justices said the law may be invoked against
business fraud, not only traditional forms of organized crime.
   After re-examining the Parkchester case, the 2nd Circuit court
in September reaffirmed its original ruling and permitted the suit.
   The suit is separate from a federal tax evasion criminal case
that resulted in the conviction of Helmsley's wife, Leona.
   Harry Helmsley was found incompetent to stand trial on the
criminal charges in that case because of memory loss and reasoning
problems caused by several slight strokes.
   The case acted on today is Helmsley vs. Beauford, 89-572.

   Rock star Prince won a legal battle today as

   The court, without comment, let stand decisions dismissing
claims by Prince's half-sister, Lorna Nelson of Minneapolis, Minn.,
that his song's lyrics are too similar to an unpublished song she
wrote.
   Ms. Nelson in 1987 sued Prince, whose full name is Prince Rogers
Nelson, and PRN Productions, his record business based in
Chanhassen, Minn.
   Her federal suit contended that the lyrics to ``U Got The Look''
infringed on her copyright in an unpublished song, ``What's Cooking
in this Book.''
   U.S. District Judge David S. Doty last year threw out Ms.
Nelson's suit, ruling that no substantial similarity existed
between the two song lyrics. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal last May 3.
   The case is Nelson vs. PRN Productions, 89-725.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to protect
Alabama car dealers from being sued by customers who say they were
sold a lemon.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand an Alabama
Supreme Court ruling that such car buyers can sue even if they
signed contracts saying all disputes will be referred to binding
arbitration.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   Jack and Juanita Warren, residents of St. Clair County, Ala.,
sued a Birmingham car dealership, Jim Skinner Ford Inc., in 1987
after experiencing what they said were numerous problems with the
new car they had bought three months before.
   The sales contract the Warrens had signed called for binding
arbitration of any dispute.
   Jim Skinner Ford immediately sought to freeze the lawsuit until
arbitration was completed, contending such action was required
under the Federal Arbitration Act.
   In past decisions, the nation's highest court has ruled that the
federal law precludes a state court proceeding over an alleged
breach of contract if the disputed contract affected interstate
commerce and contained an arbitration clause.
   A state trial judge granted the dealership's request but last
July 7 the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the federal law did not
require freezing the Warrens' lawsuit.
   The state court said the sale of a car by an Alabama dealer to
Alabama residents is not covered by the federal arbitration law
because the two contracting parties did not comtemplate
``substantial interstate activity.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Jim Skinner Ford
argued that Congress never intended the federal law to be so
narrowly confined.
   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by two associations representing over 1,000 car
dealerships in Alabama. They said the state Supreme Court ruling
deprives car dealers of their right to enforce arbitration
agreements.
   Lawyers for the Warrens urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   They said the federal arbitration law's provisions ``never were
intended to apply to contracts ... involving the consumer purchase
of a product by a citizen of one state from a retailer residing in
the same state.''
   The case is Jim Skinner Ford vs. Warren, 89-567.

   Senate leaders are pledging support for
liberalized trade with the Soviet Union in response to the Malta
summit, but some members urge caution against speeded-up arms
control talks.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
called the weekend meeting a ``successful and constructive summit''
but warned of pressure that it might exert on ongoing
weapons-reduction negotiations.
   ``There's nothing wrong with the leaders giving a push to the
arms control negotiators, but there would be danger here if we
pushed them so hard and so fast that we get a bad agreement, rather
than one that will stand the test of time,'' Nunn said on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation.''
   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended
their two-day summit on Sunday, hailing a new era of East-West
peace. Both leaders said they would meet again in June in the
United States with the possibility of agreements in 1990 to cut
long-range nuclear weapons and conventional forces as well as
progress toward a chemical weapons ban.
   Nunn proposed that the superpower leaders set up teams to
discuss long-range cutbacks beyond agreements currently being
negotiated.
   ``Conceptual discussions now should not have to wait the
details,'' Nunn said, adding, ``But neither should we start
negotiating new things which would even further delay the existing
negotiations.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas also expressed
concern that Bush and Gorbachev might be putting too much pressure
on arms control negotiators to reach agreements.
   ``I'm a little bit concerned about trying to put a deadline on
any arms control negotiations,'' said Dole, adding, ``I hope that
wasn't done.'' He said he needed more details of the summit talks
before making a final assessment.
   Dole, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
said the summit put Bush ``back in the global arena. He's providing
leadership, and that's good for all of us.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
first Bush-Gorbachev summit a ``successful meeting'' which should
lead to both weapons reductions and a better economic relationship
with the Soviet Union.
   Mitchell, also interviewed on ABC, said he supports ``most
favored nation'' trade status for the Soviet Union but said it
would not likely produce any significant increase in sales of
Soviet-made goods in this country.
   ``They've got some things to sell but not much that Americans or
other countries will want to buy,'' Mitchell said.
   The administration has promised to give Moscow increased
benefits, and to support its bid to participate in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trading
organization, in exchange for Soviet relaxation of emigration
restrictions on Soviet Jews.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., interviewed on CNN's ``Sunday
Today,'' said he expects Bush to have more trouble with Republicans
than Democrats in getting ratification of treaties with the Soviets.
   He said Congress likely would repeal laws that restrict trade
with the Soviet Union.
   ``I think the Congress is ready and prepared to support that, so
long as the Soviet performance on immigration remains good, which
it has been in recent months,'' Hamilton said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the events in Eastern Europe upstaged the summit,
reaffirming the fact that ``the two most powerful countries in the
world don't make all the key decisions about the world.''
   Aspin in a statement also called the two-day superpower session
a ``potatoes summit. The meaty summit will come next summer.''
   ``The potatoes summit is important, nonetheless,'' said Aspin,
who hailed the unprecedented joint Bush-Gorbachev news conference
for making it clear that ``our differences have not disappeared ...
and we can cope with them in a civilized manner, that is to say, in
a political rather than a military way.''

   The court refused to block a ruling that the county's school
officials take further steps to integrate the 73,000-student school
system, the largest in Georgia.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on Nov. 22 temporarily blocked
enforcement of a desegregation ruling by the 11th U.S. Court of
Appeals to give him more time to study the county's emergency plea.
He then referred the case to the full court.
   The county, in suburban Atlanta, has been under court order to
desegregate its schools since 1969.
   U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley ruled last year that the
county had done all it could to integrate its schools, agreeing
with officials that housing patterns were the primary cause of any
remaining racial segregation in public schools.
   That decision was overturned last October by the 11th Circuit
court, which said officials must consider ``pairing and
clustering'' schools in different parts of the county to attain
racial balance, a move that would require busing.
   School officials said the appeals court ruling sounded a ``death
knell'' for neighborhood schools in Georgia, Alabama and Florida,
the three states encompassed by the 11th Circuit.
   The school officials cited a 1976 Supreme Court ruling in a case
from Pasadena, Calif., which they said means a school district
already under a desegregation order may not be forced to correct
racial imbalances in student population unless found responsible
for creating those imbalances.
   The case is Freeman vs. Pitts, A-401.

   Clogged plumbing exposed an escape
attempt by a convicted robber and murder suspect who had been
trying to burrow out of his cell and was flushing debris down the
toilet, police said.
   Randy Hellum, a fugitive for two months after an escape from
custody last summer, had been trying to tunnel through the jail's
double-layered cinderblock and brick wall, police said.
   Investigators did not know how long Hellum had been working on
the hole, but ``he'd been quiet and a model prisoner, which made us
a little suspicious, knowing his character,'' Ramsey County Sheriff
Charles Zacharias said.
   Hellum succeeded in dislodging one 8-inch by 12-inch cinderblock
from an inner wall in his cell and had removed bricks on the outer
wall before being discovered late Saturday, said Lt. Mike Shanley,
deputy director of the jail.
   ``The heroes here are the maintenance workers,'' Shanley said.
``They knew the problem shouldn't be occurring,'' with the drainage.
   Hellum, 33, is being held in lieu of $1 million bail on charges
of commiting a Nov. 3 murder while he was a fugitive from Hennepin
County, where he had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for bank
robbery.

   If you cast a jealous eye at the fashionably
fit, take heart.
   A hefty Marlon Brando was praised in the week's People magazine,
but not exactly for his jogging suit, and John Candy got mixed
reviews for knitwear.
   A panel of five fashion connoisseurs gave their opinions in the
magazine's annual review of celebrity attire.
   Candy's outfit was compared to ``a dad's sweater,'' by one
reviewer. But another said, ``One more chin-up and he'd look a lot
better.'' The word on Brando: ``It doesn't matter what he wears,
even if it is a parachute.''
   First lady Barbara Bush won praise for her faux pearls, and one
panelist gushed over Jackie Onassis as ``the hippest woman ever.''
   Praises also went to Princess Diana _ ``She's got the legs for
it'' _ and Angela Lansbury _ ``10 out of 10.''
   The review of style-makers and breakers dubbed actress Sean
Young ``the scariest woman in fashion,'' and panned Roseanne Barr's
``Mr. T look.''
   Actress Kim Basinger's penchant for see-through evening wear is
blasted: ``Is that a tattoo or is it her lingerie?''

   Rebel soldiers positioned in hotels
and high-rises fired on government troops in the Makati financial
district today, refusing to end a 4-day-old mutiny and trapping
hundreds of people in homes and hotel rooms.
   A rebel spokesman said the trapped foreigners would be freed
Tuesday but he said this did not mean the mutineers were giving up
their fight to oust President Corazon Aquino.
   ``We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to
the last drop of our blood,'' said the spokesman, Capt. Alfred Yen.
   Two bombs exploded in the city, injuring two people. It was
unclear if they were related to the coup attempt, which began
Friday and has killed at least 70 people.
   Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners were pinned down in
homes and hotels in the post Makati district, where forces loyal to
Mrs. Aquino contained the mutineers to 22 buildings.
   Rebels shot at anyone venturing outside.
   ``Literally, we're in the middle,'' said Barbara Julich, a New
York businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. ``(We're)
now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is no
baby food, and the mothers are hysterical.
   ``We saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks
are. They were eventually shot at and took cover.''
   At least three people were reported slain in Makati today and 15
wounded, including one American, by rebel snipers and in fighting
between rebel and loyalist forces.
   Earlier, spokesmen for the Makati Medical Center said 10 people
were killed. They said the discrepancy was due to an error in
records.
   Government troops forced the surrender of more than 600 rebels
Sunday, and Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the coup attempt had
been crushed but that it would take several days to complete
``mopping up operations.''
   This is the sixth and most serious coup attempt against Mrs.
Aquino.
   Insurgents seized Makati on Saturday, trading fire with
government troops and sending bystanders racing for cover.
Government forces appeared reluctant to attack for fear of killing
foreigners.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said about 215 Americans
were believed trapped in three hotels in the wealthy district. An
undetermined number of others were believed trapped in luxury
apartments.
   Hospital sources identified the American wounded as Jerome
Weissburg, who they said was hit in the arm by glass when a bullet
shattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel. They did
not know his hometown.
   Yen telephoned news organizations in Manila and said foreigners
would be free to leave hotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday (9 p.m. EST
Monday), to dispel any ideas they were held hostage.
   The foreigners will be taken to Manila's airport aboard shuttle
buses, Yen said.
   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded
since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed
the presidential palace Friday, according to the Red Cross.
   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for counterattacking
loyalist forces later that day.
   On Sunday, loyalist troops fought off a furious attack by the
rebels on the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo, and about
600 mutineers surrendered.
   About 400 rebels were still occupying Mactan Air Base in Cebu,
350 miles south of Manila. Their leader refused to give up and
threatened to blow up the base's planes.
   Officials arrested one coup participant who approached the
defense chief with a grenade during a news conference.
   Also today, an explosion occurred in the compound of the Central
Bank, the equivalent of the Federal Reserve. There were no injuries.
   A second bomb went off in the Ermita entertainment district,
damaging an unoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two women
were injured by flying glass.
   In the morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in Makati _
members of the army's First Scout Ranger Regiment _ refused appeals
to surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approached
their strongholds.
   The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. Aquino, swept to power in a
1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist
insurgency and economic problems.
   One of the coup leaders was Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a
cashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. Aquino but
later led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained at
large.
   The city's international airport reopened today but domestic air
service was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed but
government employees were ordered to return to work except in the
Makati area.
   Officials reported shortages of food and fuel from interruptions
caused by the fighting.
   More than 10,000 people fled their homes to escape the fighting
and were housed in schools, churches and other refugee centers.
   Most provincial garrisons did not join the mutiny, but there
were indications of widespread support among junior and
middle-grade officers.
   In Manila, guards arrested an army sergeant who tried to bomb a
news conference held by Ramos and military chief Gen. Renato De
Villa, an official said today. Sgt. Romy Aquino (no relation to the
president) was moving toward the officials with a grenade when
arrested Sunday afternoon, said Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of
the military's Civil Relations Service.

   Arctic air howled across the nation's northern tier today, and
winter's bite was felt as far south as Florida, where a possible
frost kept citrus growers checking their trees and sun lovers all
bundled up.
   Heavy snow buried parts of Maine, West Virginia and the Great
Lakes states. Some snowbelt areas received nearly 2 feet of
winter's white by early today.
   Schools were closed in two counties in West Virginia and in
northern areas of Maine. In Pickens, W. Va., 14 inches of snow fell
and temperatures dipped to 6 degrees overnight.
   The frigid winds were expected to drop wind chills to 50 degrees
below zero in northern New York and Vermont.
   In St. Paul, Minn., the cold apparently killed two homeless men,
police said Sunday. The wind chill dipped to minus 11 Saturday
night.
   At Miller's Bar in St. Paul, a man in his mid-60s who gave his
name as ``Hard Rock,'' said he knew the victims. He feared more
homeless would meet the same fate.
   ``This is going to happen all winter _ people dying in the
cold,'' he said.
   In Agawam, Mass., where temperatures dipped to near zero, police
found the body of a 60-year-old homeless man outside a trailer
Sunday morning.
   ``He had apparently tried to get into the trailer,'' Police
Officer Wayne Macey said.
   The wintry weather was blamed for at least four other deaths
this weekend. Three people died in two separate traffic accidents
on snow-covered New York highways, while one person was killed in a
crash on an icy Montana road.
   In Maine, Loring Air Force Base in Limestone reported 26 inches
of snow on the ground late Sunday. But an additional foot of snow
may fall before the storm ends, forecasters said.
   The National Weather Service said some areas of New York state
east of Lake Erie were expected to receive almost 2 feet of snow by
the end of the storm.
   West Valley, a hamlet 30 miles south of Buffalo, received 18
inches by late Sunday. The snow didn't keep everyone in.
   A fund-raising event at the West Valley Volunteer Fire
Department drew 60 people, and at the West Valley Market a steady
stream of customers filed by cashier Marcia McCabe.
   ``We've had people coming in and they say it is up to their
knees,'' she said.
   Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern Ohio and
in western Pennsylvania.
   In the Deep South, cold winds blew across Georgia. Temperatures
with the wind chill factor plummeted as low as 10 degrees in
Atlanta. Winds gusted to 30 mph Sunday night in the Atlanta area.
   In Florida, the season's most severe cold was expected to send
temperatures to near record lows before warming later this week.
Lows today should range from the mid-20s in the Panhandle to the
mid- to upper 40s in the Keys, according to the weather service.
   But many citrus growers said they weren't too worried about the
chill.
   ``Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,''
said Bill Becker, chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission. He
said temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put the
trees into a dormant phase, which make them more resistant to
future cold weather.
   Heavy damage occurs when temperatures go below 28 degrees for
more than four consecutive hours, he said.

   State Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze
Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, announced a shift in his position on abortion, angering
anti-abortion activists.
   Celebrezze, who had voiced a strong anti-abortion position since
entering the state Senate in 1975, told reporters Saturday he
supports public funding of abortions for low-income women and would
veto legislation to ban abortion.
   Celebrezze said he now believes women should have the right to
choose abortion until the fetus is determined to be viable, at
which point the rights of the fetus become paramount.
   The switch comes amid growing evidence that a strong
anti-abortion stance can be a political liability. Abortion played
a prominent role in the recent gubernatorial races in Virginia and
New Jersey, and pro-choice candidates won both elections.
   Celebrezze was expected to announce his candidacy later this
month for the Democratic primary to be held in May.
   ``My own beliefs lead me to conclude that abortion is almost
always the wrong solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy,''
he said. ``Public officials, however, have a special obligation to
explain what role the government they serve ought to play in the
abortion decision.''
   But Curt Steiner, spokesman for Republican gubernatorial
candidate George Voinovich, who opposes abortion, said Celebrezze
can't have it both ways.
   ``I think this is a shocking reversal. Here's a person who says
he wants to run on his record, then the first thing he does is run
away from his record,'' he said.
   Jill L. Spangler, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League Ohio, called the announcement good news for
the Celebrezze campaign.
   ``It is perfectly valid to change one's mind, especially on
something as important as this,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set the stage for a
significant ruling on the government's power to fine air polluters.
   The court agreed to hear an appeal by General Motors, which
faces fines of up to $25,000 a day for violating federal air
quality standards at a Massachusetts car-assembly plant.
   The justices will review a ruling that the federal government's
failure to meet a deadline for approving or rejecting revised state
pollution controls does not bar it from fining GM.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to hear arguments favoring states' rights and consider
limiting the federal government's power to control water used by
hydroelectric dams.
   The court said it will hear a California appeal supported by
nearly every other state.
   _ Left intact a ruling that limits the power of states and their
citizens to block shipments of hazardous waste from other states.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Alabama
officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from
an abandoned Texas chemical refinery to Alabama.
   _ Agreed to decide whether U.S. banks with branch offices
overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or
freeze those accounts.
   The court said it will review rulings that required Citibank to
pay depositors. Lawyers for Citibank said billions of dollars are
at stake. There are more than 900 branches of U.S. banks operating
in 73 countries, with some $225 billion in deposits.
   _ Rejected a plea from DeKalb County, Ga., school officials
ordered to consider racial desegregation measures that include
busing.
   The court refused to block a ruling that the county's school
officials take further steps to integrate the 73,000-student school
system, the largest in Georgia.
   The air pollution case involves pollution from car paint at GM's
plant in Framingham, and focuses on the joint federal-state system
for cleaning up the atmosphere.
   Under the federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency sets national air quality standards. The states
are required to adopt plans to meet those standards, and submit the
plans to the EPA.
   The federal agency in 1980 approved a Massachusetts plan for
reducing pollution from paint at auto assembly factories.
   The plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal
rules by Dec. 31, 1985.
   But EPA officials extended the deadline for any plant switching
from lacquer paints to enamel, which emits less pollutants.
   GM initially planned to stay with lacquer at the Framingham
factory but in June 1985 announced it would convert to enamel by
the summer of 1987. The company asked that it not be required to
comply with the Dec. 31, 1985, standards until 20 months later.
   Massachusetts officials approved GM's proposal and submitted a
revised plan to the EPA on Dec. 30, 1985.
   Without waiting for federal approval, GM began building a $200
million plant in Framingham to use the enamel system while
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint.
   EPA officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines
of up to $25,000 a day against GM for 20 months of air-quality
violations at the old Framingham plant.
   It was not until September 1988 that the EPA rejected the
state-approved pollution control system at the new plant.
   A federal judge barred the EPA from imposing fines against GM
for violations of the Dec. 31, 1985, standards. The judge said the
federal agency itself violated the Clean Air Act by taking more
than four months to rule on the state-approved plan submitted Dec.
30, 1985.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June said the
EPA's failure to meet the four-month deadline does not disqualify
it from fining companies that violate previously approved pollution
control rules.
   The public should not be penalized with dirtier air because of
what often are unavoidable EPA delays, the appeals court said.
   It told the trial judge to decide how much the fines should be,
stating he should take into account whether the EPA's delay was
reasonable and what impact the delay had on GM.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined GM in urging the Supreme
Court to review the air pollution dispute.
   Chamber of Commerce lawyers said the 1st Circuit court ruling is
an incentive to the EPA to treat companies unfairly. They said it
conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts.
   The Bush administration said the 1st Circuit court's ruling was
correct.
   The case is General Motors vs. U.S., 89-369.

   Retirees will have to continue paying monthly
premiums for Medicare catastrophic coverage at least until May,
even though the program is being repealed this month, federal
officials said today.
   That much time will be required to adjust and test the
government computers that now withhold the premiums from monthly
Social Security benefit checks, Social Security Commissioner
Gwendolyn King said in an interview today.
   She said the Social Security Administration hopes to stop
deducting the premiums starting with the benefit checks that arrive
in early May. Refunds of the premiums could take three or more
months beyond that date.
   The $4-a-month premium for catastrophic coverage is scheduled
under the law to rise to $5.30 on Jan. 1. Although Congress voted
last month to repeal catastrophic protection, the bill has not yet
been presented to President Bush for his signature.
   ``My concern is for those on fixed income who cannot afford to
see $5 go out of their checks,'' Ms. King said. ``That's a lot of
money for those people and it is little consolation for them to
know they will get a refund in the future.''
   The prospect of seeing retirees continue to have to pay the
premiums does not sit well either with Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.,
chairman of the Senate Aging Committee.
   ``I fear that a lengthy delay will create a firestorm of
protest,'' Pryor said in a letter to Ms. King that was made public
today. ``We must recognize the impending firestorm and move repidly
to alleviate the problem.''
   Pryor said many retirees will need the $5.30 a month to pay the
expected increase in rates for private ``Medigap'' policies as a
result of repeal of federal coverage.
   Catastrophic coverage was enacted last year to protect people 65
and older from being bankrupted by a major illness. The program
fell into disfavor with many retirees, especially those who already
have private coverage and higher-income people who were faced with
an income surtax of up to $800 a year for catastrophic.
   As a result of loud complaints from those groups, Congress
agreed last month to kill the program.
   The monthly premiums that have been deducted from benefit checks
this year will not be refunded; they will pay for hospital and
other benefits that have been in effect all year.
   Few retirees have been paying the surtax. Those who have paid it
through quarterly estimated tax payments will get a
larger-than-expected income tax refund next year.

<HEAD>Bush Says Kohl `Comfortable' With U.S. Stand on Reunification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday that West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared comfortable with the U.S.
insistence that any moves to German reunfication be gradual.
   Bush said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev voiced concern at
their summit meeting over the weekend that outside forces would try
to impose an ``artificial'' deadline for German reunification.
   At a news conference after he presented a summit briefing to
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Bush reiterated
the four-point U.S. position on reunification.
   _It must be pursued based on self-determination of the people of
East and West Germany, without anyone trying to dictate in advance
what form unification would take.
   _Unification must be pursued in the context of Germany's
continued commitment to NATO and the European Community.
   _Moves toward unification should be ``peaceful, gradual, and
part of a step-by-step process.''
   _The Helsinki accord respecting the borders in Europe should be
observed, and changes should be made only peacefully.
   ``I think Chancellor Kohl feels comfortable with the four things
I just said,'' Bush added.
   The first three points are similar to some of the 10 points
outlined recently by Kohl in his plan for moving toward
reunification.
   Bush was asked about his insistence that a unified Germany
remain committed to NATO. By contrast, Gorbachev contends the
division of Germany was dictated by history and that East Germany
should remain part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``I think his view was one of ... caution,'' Bush said. ``I
really believe that. I think he recognized the rapidity of change.
He has very constructively talked about peaceful change.''
   ``I think he feels that if there were outside forces setting
dates that would complicate the way he is helping manage the change
in the pact,'' Bush added.

   Following is the text of President
Bush's news conference Monday following his meeting with NATO
leaders.
   President Bush: I have a statement and then I'll be glad to
respond to your questions.
   This year, the people of the East made fundamental choices about
their destiny and governments there began to honor the citizens'
right to choose. What these changes amount to is nothing less than
a peaceful revolution. And the task before us, therefore, is to
consolidate the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the
architecture for continued peaceful change, to end the division of
Europe and of Germany, to make Europe whole and free.
   Great choices are being made, greater opportunities beckon. The
political strategy for NATO that we agreed upon last May makes the
promotion of greater freedom in the East a basic element of
Alliance policy. Accordingly, NATO should promote human rights,
democracy and reform within Eastern countries as the best means of
encouraging reconciliation among the countries of Eastern and
Western Europe.
   Although this is a time of great hope, and it is, we must not
blur the distinction between promising expectations and present
realities. We must remain constant with NATO's traditional security
mission. I pledged today that the United States will maintain
significant military forces in Europe, as long as our allies desire
our presence as part of a common defense effort. The U.S. will
remain a European power, and that means that the United States will
stay engaged in the future of Europe and in our common defense.
Many of the values that should guide Europe's future are described
in the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. These values encompass the freedom of people to choose
their destiny under a rule of law with rulers who are
democratically accountable.
   I think we can look to the CSCE to play a greater role in the
future of Europe. The 35 nations of the CSCE bridge both the
division of Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. It's a structure that
should be able to contribute much to the future architecture of
Europe.
   I also appreciate the vital role that the EC must play in the
new Europe. And it's my belief that the events of our times call
both for a continued, perhaps even intensified, effort of the 12 to
integrate and a role for the EC as a magnet that draws the forces
of reform toward Eastern Europe. And that's why I was exceptionally
pleased that we agreed at the Paris economic summit on a specific
role for the EC in that group of 24 effort to assist Poland and
Hungary.
   We stand on the threshold of a new era, and we know that we are
contributing to a process of history, driven by the peoples
determined to be free. The people of Europe, especially the brave
citizens of the East, are illuminating the future, and yet, the
outcome is not predestined. It depends on our continued strength
and our solidarity as an alliance. Our transatlantic partnership
can create the architecture of a new era and a new Atlanticism,
where self-determination and individual freedom everywhere replace
coercion and tyranny, where economic freedom everywhere replaces
economic controls and stagnation, and where lasting peace is
reinforced everywhere by common respect for the rights of man.
   I now would be glad to respond to some questions. And we've got
to be out of here in about _ a little after quarter of.
   Q. Mr. President, I have a two-part question. You've made it
clear that you are going stay in Europe. But in view of the
dramatic reduction in tensions and the obvious weakening of the
Warsaw Pact, what will be the real American role? And two, will
there now be more money for the poor and the homeless, public
housing? The nation is really badly in need of repair of
infrastructure.
   A. We have a lot of demands at home, and there's no question
about that. But I think it is premature to speak as some are at
home about a ``peace dividend'' _ take a lot of money out of
defense and put it into other worthy causes. And so I _ I _ as I
started over the budget figures for the next budget cycle we are
under a tremendous burden to get our total spending down in order
to meet the Gramm-Rudman and the Gramm-Rudman targets. In terms of
the U.S. role, I think I set it out here pretty well. We will
continue to play a very active role in NATO. I see nothing that
diminishes the importance of the United States. And I might say
that I gathered from our interlocutors there _ the other heads of
state and government _ that they want us fully involved. And I _ I
_ thinking back on my talk with Mr. Gorbachev, I don't see any
conflict there either.
   Q. Mr. President, Vernon Walters, your trusted adviser and the
ambassador to Bonn, said that he envisions a _ said that Germany,
East and West, will be reunited withint five years. Do you think
that's possible? And what would be the implications for NATO and
the Warsaw Pact?
   A. I am not into the predicting of time on the question of
Germany. Let me just _ I don't know whether the secretary general
read you these points. Let me just read the four points that
represent the U.S. position on reunification.

   BRUSSELS: on reunification.

<TEXT>
   Self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to its
outcome, and we should not at this time endorse any particular
vision. Secondly, unification should occur in the context of
Germany's continued commitment to NATO, an increasingly integrated
European Community, and with due regard for the legal role and
responsibilities of the Allied powers. Third, in the interest of
general European stability, moves toward unification must be
peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step basis. And these were
_ and lastly, on the question of borders, we should reiterate our
support for the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.
   So, I am not trying to accelerate that process. I don't think
our allies are. I think Chancellor Kohl feels comfortable with the
four points I have just read. And so I think it's better to let
things move on their own and without the United States certainly
setting some kind of deadline.
   Q. Mr. President, you said, in announcing your meeting with
Chairman Gorbachev, that one of the main reasons was that you
wanted to make sure that, in this time of change, you didn't miss
anything. In your two days of meetings, did you learn anything that
you fear, or feel, that you might have missed, had you not had this?
   A. Yes. What I would have missed is I wouldn't see quite as
clearly his priorities. I see them more clearly because he and I
sat down and talked. We had about eight hours of talks _ some
private. And I feel I can sense much more clearly the things he
feels more strongly about. And we had a good chance to point out to
him some of the difficulties with our relationship. It wasn't all
sweetness and light. I had a very _ very good opportunity to tell
him how we view the _ our problems in our own hemisphere: the
sending of arms in there to help the FMLN, and the role that _
unhelpful role _ that Cuba is playing.
   I recited in detail the Oscar Arias phone call to me: ``Please
raise with Mr. Gorbachev the unhelpful role, the destructive role
of Cuba.'' So I think it's more emphasis, although we did put
forward some general themes on the economy. And I think he was
pleased, because I think from his standpoint _ and this is
important from mine _ he now sees that we want to have a
cooperative, forward-leaning relationship with the Soviet Union.
   Q. Mr. President, you have, perhaps more than any contemporary
American president, exercised personal diplomacy, establishing
personal friendships with a wide variety of leaders. Are you
prepared now to say that Mr. Gorbachev is your friend?
   A. I'll say this: We had a very friendly _ conversations, and
then once in a while there were _ a little tension there. But it
was extraordinarily friendly in the conversation aspect. I don't
know how you go further than that in definition. But I'm convinced
that he is determined to do that's what _ that what he told me he's
doing _ reform, perestroika. Openness _ we totally agree on is a
democratic value. So, Brit, what happened was, I think he took my
measure and I took his, and I think we just feel more comfortable
about our common objectives.
   Yeah, John?
   Q. I want to go back to what Helen asked you about. You said
that you had made an Atlantic policy. ...
   A. Keep talking _ I'm just _ going to get some water.
   Q. After World War II, the Europeans needed our money for the
Marshall Plan. Then they needed our military backing because of the
Soviet threat. But now, if the Soviet military is a question that
one of your successors will have to deal with _ eventually what are
they going to need from us? What role do we really have to play
here? We don't live on this continent.
   A. Well, we have a tremendous interaction, if you want to
hypothetically project that _ that guaranteed peaceful time, I
would say interaction with the United States on student exchanges,
cultural exchanges, economic matters. I mean, there's a tremendous
potential for a Soviet Union that is in accord with us on these
democratic values. It's a tremendous market, for example, but it
needs the economic reform. So what we've got to do is be sure that
we conduct ourselves in such a way that the changes, the political
reforms, can keep going forward there in Eastern Europe, that they
can _ that the Soviet Union can do what Mr. Gorbachev is trying to
do internally. And then there's just enormous potential for living
at peace with that tremendous power.
   Q. Sir, maybe I misstated my question. What I really mean is,
what _ why do West Europeans need us once the military threat
recedes _ the West Europeans? Why would there have to be a NATO?
This is a political and military alliance, and it's really only a
political alliance because of the military need.
   A. You mean _ would _ why will there always have to be a U.S.
presence?
   Q. Why will there always have to be a NATO?
   A. Well, I'm not sure _ I'm _ if you want to project out 100
years or. ...
   Q. Well, no. ...
   A. _ take some _ take some years off of that, you can look to a
utopian day when there might not be. But as I pointed out to them,
that day hasn't arrived, and they agree with me. And so the United
States must stay involved. What we don't want to do is send the
signal of decoupling, the decoupling of the United States and
Canada from NATO, particularly at this highly sensitive time, and
Mr. Gorbachev understood that. He made that point to me.
   Yes?
   Q. Did President Gorbachev ask your forebearance in case he
decided to crack down on dissidents, and if so, what did you say?
Or what role did the question of ethnic and Baltic dissent have in
your meeting?
   A. The answer to the first part is no. And the answer to the
second part is I asked him to describe for me the problems inside _
the nationality problems inside the Soviet Union, and he did it in
considerable detail.
   Yeah?

<HEAD>EPA Calls for Curbs on EBDC Family of Pesticides</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 2 grafs with crops affected by withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency today
called for sharp curbs on the widely used EBDC family of
pesticides, proposing that the chemical no longer be applied to 42
crops including apples and tomatoes because of concerns about
cancer.
   The proposed regulation, which would not become final until
early 1991, would allow the continued use of the EBDC fungicides on
10 crops including grapes, onion and cranberries.
   The EPA said the use of the EBDCs _ known as maneb, mancozeb and
metiram _ on the remaining 10 crops ``do not present an
unreasonable risk.'' The agency estimated the maximum risk of
someone getting cancer from a lifetime of exposure at three in 1
million. With the chemical's current widespread use that risk is 4
in 10,000, it said.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly applauded a decision announced
earlier this year by EBDC manufacturers to withdraw the chemical's
use on 42 crops. But he said ``we do not believe that goes far
enough'' and proposed that the ban apply as well to three
additional crops _ tomatoes, bananas and potatoes.
   The manufacturers have said they would begin their voluntary
curbs at the end of the year. EBDC use on the other three crops
would not go into effect for at least 18 months unless producers
choose to incorporate them in their voluntary curb.
   The EBDC chemicals, which began to be used in the 1930s, are
among the most widely used fungicides, with as much as 18 million
pounds manufactured annually for use on most common vegetables as
well as grains.
   But the fungicide has come under attack from environmentalists
and health specialists because a breakdown product called ETU has
been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Chronic exposure
also raises the risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders,
scientists said.
   The EPA said that while the health risks associated with EBDC
use on any one crop may be negligible, ``the cumulative risks
(associated with its widespread use) has been determined to be
unreasonable.''
   The health risk estimates are based on the maximum allowable
dosage of the fungicide on various crops. The EPA said those
estimates likely are greater than residue levels found in the
marketplace because the fungicide is easily washed off.
   Crop producers as well as state agriculture departments had
asked the EPA to hold off proposing restrictions on the EBDCs until
a marketbasket survey currently under way is completed to provide a
clearer picture of residue levels actually found on crops by
consumers.
   The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
said in a letter to Reilly that several states already had reported
results of surveys and ``to date no significant residues of EBDCs
have been found.''
   Environmental groups, however, have criticized the EPA for
moving too slowely in getting the EBDCs off the market, noting that
a final regulation on the chemical will not be issued until the
spring of 1991.
   Under the EPA proposal, EBDCs would continue to be used on
grapes, wheat, cranberries, onions, sugar beets, sweet corn,
peanuts, almonds, asparagus and figs.
   The 42 crops on which EBDCs currently are used, but would no
longer be used under voluntary curbs by the chemical's
manufacturers, are:
   Apples, apricots, barley, casaba melons, crenshaw melons,
cucumbers, eggplants, endives, lettuce, pineapples, pumpkins, green
beans, dried beans, lima beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts,
cabbage, cantaloupes, carrots, cauliflower, celery, collards, field
corn, cotton, crabapples, fennel, honeydew melons, kale, kohlrabi,
mustard greens, nectarines, oats, papayas, peaches, pears, pecans,
peppers, rhubarb, rye, squash, spinach, turnips and watermelon.

   A 26-year-old woman has a new heart, liver,
and kidney after an almost daylong operation that doctors called
the first of its kind.
   Cindy Martin of Archbald remained in critical condition today at
Presbyterian-University Hospital, which is normal after transplant
surgery.
   At a news conference this morning, doctors said they would try
to begin weaning her off a respirator today.
   Other multiorgan transplants have been performed, but this was
the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, said transplant
pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl, director of the University of
Pittsburgh's transplant program.
   The procedure began at 7:35 p.m. Saturday and ended at 5 p.m.
Sunday.
   It was Ms. Martin's second heart transplant. She has familial
cardiomyopathy, an inherited heart disease, according to the
hospital.
   Mrs. Martin's family has a history of congenital heart problems.
Her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on his side of
the family also have died young, her husband, John Martin, 28, said
today.
   Mrs. Martin suffered from chronic rejection of the heart she
received in her first transplant three years ago, and had developed
hepatitis and kidney dysfunction. Kidney dysfunction can affect
patients taking the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine.
   Doctors will treat Mrs. Martin with the Japanese drug FK-506,
which is believed 50 to 100 times more effective than cyclosporine,
hospital spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said. FK-506 has been tested since
February in Pittsburgh on liver, heart, kidney, pancreas and lung
recipients.
   The new organs came from an Atlanta woman in her 20s who was
killed in a car accident, doctors said.
   When doctors called Saturday to say a donor had been found,
Martin said he had to scramble to locate his wife.
   ``We had a tough time finding her at first because she was out
shopping when the call came,'' Martin said. ``I'm nervous of
course. The first transplant sort of prepared me a little for this,
but I'm just nervous as to what the outcome might be.''
   Her operation came five days after another milestone in
transplant operations. In Chicago, 21-month-old Alyssa Smith became
the nation's first person to receive part of a liver from a living
donor. Alyssa was listed in serious condition Sunday, and is
improving steadily, said John Easton, a spokesman for the
University of Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital. Alyssa's mother,
Teresa, was the donor.
   The world's first survivor of a heart-liver transplant was
Stormie Jones, now 12, of White Settlement, Texas. Starzl conducted
that procedure on Feb. 14, 1984, at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   Two other heart-liver transplants were performed the next year
in Pittsburgh, but both patients died with a few days of surgery.
   Starzl also has headed multiple-organ transplant operations
involving the intestines.
   Tabatha Foster, 3, of Madisonville, Ky., survived six months
before dying in May 1988 after a multiple-organ transplant.
Rolandrea Dodge, 3, of Fruitland, N.M., died last January, six
weeks after surgery.
   Starzl also has headed multiple-organ transplants on adults with
malignant, inoperable tumors in the pancreas and liver areas.
   In those cases, surgeons have removed the patient's liver,
pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and
duodenum, a 10-inch-long section of the small intestine. The cavity
has been filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver,
pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the small
intestine.

   A hospital bed mattress was set afire by the
cigarette of a patient smoking in bed, and the 77-year-old smoker
was killed, officials said.
   Nurses at Parkway Hospital discovered the fire after a smoke
alarm sounded early Sunday in the private room of Rudolph Kurtz,
who was recovering from prostrate surgery, said chief marketing
officer Daniel A. Baldwin.
   A nurse pulled Kurtz onto the floor while another staff member
fought the blaze, which was confined to Kurtz's room.
   About 40 other patients on the wing were evacuated while the
fire was being fought.
   Kurtz suffered third-degree and fourth-degree burns over 80
percent of his body. He was taken to Hermann Hospital, where he
died about two hours later.
   The incident will be reviewed to see if policy changes should be
made regarding smokers, Baldwin said.

   Hundreds of thousands of people
chanting ``Resign! Resign!'' rallied in the nation's two biggest
cities today to protest the new Communist-dominated government and
demand a new one be named by the weekend.
   Waving red, white and blue national flags, a crowd in Prague's
Wenceslas Square cheered opposition calls for a general strike Dec.
11 if there is no new government by Sunday.
   Boos and derisive whistles greeted the mention of old Communist
Party leaders responsible for 21 years of hard-line policy.
   In the nation's second-largest city, Bratislava, tens of
thousands gathered in central Namestie Square despite the numbing
cold to vent their anger. They chanted ``Resign!'' and ``Shame!
Shame!'' as speaker after speaker accused Premier Ladislav Adamec
of ignoring the will of the people.
   Civic Forum, the largest opposition movement, demanded elections
by July. A group spokesman, Vaclav Maly, said the opposition hoped
to field its own candidates.
   ``Thanks for your help and support,'' Maly shouted to the crowd
in Prague. ``We need it now more than ever.''
   It was the first protest in Prague since Civic Forum staged a
general strike a week ago. That strike, observed by millions, led
Adamec to agree to relinquish the Communists' 41-year monopoly on
power.
   But the new 21-member Cabinet named Sunday contained only five
non-Communists, and Communists retained all the key ministries.
   ``We Want a Happy Christmas, Christmas with a new government,''
read a poster near Civic Forum's Prague headquarters today. ``An
old play with a new cast,'' warned another poster on the same
window.
   The turnouts at the rallies were clear signals to the government
that the opposition can still draw popular support to back its
demands for democracy.
   ``Long live Havel!'' protesters shouted to welcome playwright
Vaclav Havel, the country's most prominent dissident, to Wenceslas
Square. The rally was reported live on state radio and television.
   State radio estimated the crowd at 200,000, but Western
reporters put it at about 150,000.
   ``We feel disappointed and cheated,'' said Michal Sedlacek, a
representative of striking students who decided to prolong their
two-week sit-in at campuses across the country in protest of the
new government.
   ``The government doesn't understand the situation fully,''
Sedlacek told the cheering crowd. ``We want other changes.''
   ``With this government, the leading role of the Communist party
was assured,'' said another speaker, director Miroslav Machocek.
   ``In fact, the leading role has been abolished in the
constitution but with this government it exists again,'' he added.
Machocek said artists, theaters and galleries will go on strike
until Dec. 11.
   Actor Milan Knazko, a key Slovak republic figure in the popular
uprising, said no rally had been planned in Bratislava, ``but the
government had sent us this invitation'' to demonstrate by ignoring
the people.
   The new government appeared an attempt by the ruling Communists
to buy time and get reform going at a pace they dictate, rather
than the hectic tempo forced by the mass demonstrations last month.
   Wenceslas Square was the focal point of 11 days of mass
pro-democracy demonstrations that forced a number of concessions
from the Communists last week, including the promise of free
elections and the removal of the party's monopoly on power.
   Adamec has so far made no specific mention of free elections.
   One of the concessions was the lifting of travel restrictions
today.
   Czechoslovaks were still required, however, to have a visa from
most Western countries they wished to visit, with only Austria
lifting visa requirements.
   Border guards reported that fewer than 3,000 Czechoslovaks
crossed today into Austria. Most were just visiting, lacking enough
money to stay permanently. Unlike East Germans going to West
Germany, Czechoslovaks did not receive any ``welcome money'' in
Austria.
   The relatively light turnout, compared with the flood that
poured out of East Germany when its borders were opened Nov. 9, was
due in part to the fact that today was a workday. Also, most
Czechoslovaks do not have much hard currency, and the country's
travel restrictions had not been as stringent as other East bloc
countries'.
   The opposition saw another of its demands met with the
announcement on the state news agency CTK that it would be given a
building that had belonged to the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship
Society to use as its Prague headquarters.
   Until now, Civic Forum has been operating from the striking
Laterna Magika theater.
   The new government includes three people without party
affiliation and one each from the Socialist and People's parties,
which have traditionally been docile Communist allies but have
become more independent in recent months.
   Deputy Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Miroslav Vacek moved up to
take over the Defense Ministry, and Frantisek Pinc, a politically
unknown Communist who last served as director of a nuclear power
station, got the Interior Ministry.
   The official CTK news agency said 11 of the 17 Cabinet ministers
in the Czech republic had submitted their resignations, including
the unpopular ministers of education and justice.

   Q. Mr. President, you had mentioned that you got some insight
into President Gorbachev at this summit. I wonder if the insight
included any sense of his internal position? Did he behave as if a
man operating from a strong position, a man who seems to be in
jeopardy, or how do you feel about that?
   A. I though he seemed very much in control, you can tell the way
that he interacted with his own top people there. And he felt very
confident in discussing, without notes, a wide array of subjects
with me. He did have a little notebook that he referred to _ it was
written in his own handwriting, the best I could see _ and _ once
having seen it, I couldn't read it _ and so he seemed in control.
He seemed _ ``subdued'' is the wrong word, but I would say
determined and unemotional about it. The most emotion we saw was at
that press conference yesterday, but it was a wonderful
presentation. And the climate for _ leave out the weather _ the
climate for the discussions was really good.
   Yes, Margaret?
   Q. Mr. President, again as part of the insight you gained, what
is your understanding about Secretary General Gorbachev's view of
the unification of Germany? Do you think he's as opposed as he's
said in public, or do you think that he accepts the fact that. ...
   A. I think his view was one of _ if I could use a word that's
unfamiliar to many _ caution, and I really believe that. I think he
recognizes the rapidity of change. He has very constructively
talked about ``peaceful change'', and I don't _ I think his hope is
that people don't try to set up some artificial calendar by which _
date by which that reunification should happen. And I think he
feels that, if there were outside forces setting dates on something
like that, that would complicate the way in which he is managing
the change and helping manage the change in the Pact.
   Yeah? Two. Charles and then Lesley.
   Q. Mr. President, there was a lot of speculation going in that
you and Mr. Gorbachev might get involved in talking about deeper
cuts, particularly in European forces. Did you, in fact, do that?
And is there skepticism within this organization here about moving
too rapidly beyond what has now been dubbed CFE 1?
   A. No, we didn't get into that. We talked very broadly about our
aspirations for further arms control, but there was no emphasis on
that. And I _ there may be some strains in one country or another
viewing the rapidity of change differently than we do. But what I
suggested to our NATO allies is let's go forward with the
agreements we've got out there _ the CFE, let's get it done.
   I, the President of the United States, will kick our bureaucracy
and push it as fast as I possibly we can. I've talked to General
Galvin. I had a meeting with him over here last night. And I'm
convinced that we _ I must do more to keep it on schedule. And I've
encouraged the other allies to do the same. I don't think there was
any resistance to that. Similarly, START and chemical weapons.
   So before we go into a wide array of other questions, I think
the best thing to do is take advantage of the moment and move
forward in those three areas. And I _ we went _ I went over that in
little talks with individuals from NATO, as well as in the meeting
itself.
   Lesley?
   Q. But do you accept the principle of a CFE 2?
   A. Well, I'd like to get a CFE 1 in the bank first, get it
locked up, get those troops out, move down to equal levels _ U.S.
and Soviet forces. And so we ought to _ we ought to manage that
before we start the architecure of something else. I want to see
that done on time.
   Lesley?
   Q. Mr. President, on East Germany, as you know, the party
structure, the Communist Party structure has collapsed there. It's
unclear who's running the government. I wonder if you talked about
that, if you personally think that it's a dangerous situation, if
that moves unification up in the timetable at all? And secondly,
what Gorbachev said to you when you said to him, unification of
Germany would have to be in the NATO context?
   A. No, I don't think it's a dangerous situation. I don't think
anybody here in this room, including myself, has been able to
predict the rapidity of the change, the totality of the change. But
I don't see it as dangerous, as long as the Soviet leader and the
Germans and the West conduct themselves the way I've been _ been
urging.
   What was the second part?
   Q. Well, what Mr. Gorabachev said to you when you said
unification, but only in the NATO context? I mean, he keeps saying
it has to be in the Warsaw Pact context.
   A. No, we _ we _ we were _ I don't think we went into that in
real depth, Lesley.
   Q. Well, what do you think he thinks about it? I mean,
obviously. ...
   A. Well, that's too hypothetical. I got trouble figuring it out
on our side with all our experts, rather than knowing what I think
he might think about something he hasn't thought about maybe.
   Yes, Tom?
   Q. Mr. President _ Mr. President, you seem to have traveled some
distance between what you were saying about Mr. Gorbachev a year or
so ago and some of the things you said yesterday. Could you please
talk in a little bit more detail about the evolution in your
thinking that you mentioned yesterday, how that happened and what
persuaded you along the way?
   A. As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has handled the
changes in Eastern Europe, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely
mandates new thinking. And when I see his willingness to give
support to a CFE agreement that calls for him to disproportionately
reduce his forces, and that is there on the table, I think that
mandates new thinking. When I hear him talk about peaceful change
and the right of countries to choose _ countries in the Warsaw Pact
to choose _ that deserves new thinking. And so, I approach this,
and I think, in step with our allies, with a certain respect for
what he's doing and thus, we want to try to meet him on some of the
areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions I had
in the economic area. But I also believe that the West must remain
strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united
way, but not be imprudent.
   Yes, ma'am?

<HEAD>Former Prison Hostage Sues to Get Videotapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former guard who has had emotional problems
since he was held hostage during a 1987 riot at the Atlanta federal
prison is suing to get government videotapes his psychologist says
can help him end his ordeal.
   Leon Mormann, 36, was one of about 100 hostages held by Cuban
detainees during the 11-day takeover at the penitentiary two years
ago. A number of people held hostage at the Atlanta prison and
during a related prison confrontation at Oakdale, La., have
reported serious emotional problems.
   Soon after his release, Mormann accepted a transfer to a prison
in Tucson, Ariz., where the mostly Hispanic prison population
reminded him of the Atlanta prison.
   ``I flipped out,'' he said, adding that he suffered a panic
attack that put him in a psychiatric ward for a month. His wife and
daughter left him, and he has since divorced. He returned to
Atlanta in July 1988 and lives on worker's compensation.
   The federal Bureau of Prisons confirms that tapes of the Atlanta
riot exist, but has told Mormann he was not specific enough as to
which ones he wished to see when he tried to get copies through the
Freedom of Information Act.
   He sued in federal court when that effort failed.
   ``How can we be more specific? We don't even know what's on the
tapes,'' said psychologist David Aycock of Jonesboro, who has been
treating Mormann for a year. ``It's not like there's a national
security risk here. ... We're just looking for anything that can
bring him back into the situation.''
   Aycock said the tapes could help Mormann realize what he went
through and help him get on with his life.
   ``He can watch the tapes and be anxious, cut it off and go back
to it when he calms down. Control is the key,'' Aycock said.
   Aycock said Mormann has post-traumatic stress disorder, similar
to that of some war or disaster survivors, and suffers nightmares
and flashbacks.
   On the day of the Nov. 23, 1987, takeover, Aycock was the only
guard in a dormitory of about 70 Cubans considered to be model
prisoners. He locked himself in an office, but the inmates broke
the door down with a desk.
   He was handcuffed, tied and forced at knifepoint to be a human
shield for the transfer of two wounded prisoners. He was kept
handcuffed to another guard in a cell for the duration of the
takeover.
   The Cubans detained at the Atlanta prison were among those who
came to the United States in the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Thousands
who had criminal records or got into trouble after arrival were
held pending deportation. Since the riot, 122 have been sent back
to Cuba, 789 remain in custody and 3,250 have been released to
halfway houses, relatives or other sponsors.

<TEXT>
   A police specialist took the witness
stand today at the murder and drunken driving trial of Larry
Mahoney to begin a detailed reconstruction of a fiery bus crash
that killed 27 people.
   State Trooper Henry Sonny Cease Jr., an accident reconstruction
specialist, described his investigation of the May 14, 1988,
collision between the crowded bus and a small pickup Mahoney is
alleged to have been driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 south
of Carrollton.
   Cease spent 1,880 hours investigating the wreck.
   Also testifying this morning was State Police Detective Tony
Moffett, who tried to determine where Mahoney had been on the day
of the crash. He said he could account for Mahoney's whereabouts
for all but one hour and five minutes before the crash.
   Mahoney, 36, of rural Owen County, is charged with 27 counts of
murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and
a count of drunken driving.
   So far in the trial, which began with jury selection on Nov. 8,
the jury has seen the charred remains of the church bus, visited
the accident scene, heard from people who said they were nearly run
off the road by Mahoney and heard accounts from rescue workers and
police officers who went to the crash.
   Last week, 39 of the 40 survivors described in detail the panic
and horror they felt while they scrambled to escape from the
burning bus.
   Several survivors testified they tried in vain to kick out
windows. Some escaped the flames by diving over a pile of bodies at
the rear emergency exit.
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky Jr., the special
prosecutor, said he also intends to call relatives of the 24
children and three adults killed in the crash. He said the
prosecution could rest its case later this week but was not
specific.
   Defense attorney William Summers said he hasn't decided yet
whether Mahoney will testify.

<HEAD>Four Churches Vandalized Over Archbishop's Anti-Condom Stance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paint was splashed on doors of four Catholic
churches, and a group claiming responsibility said the vandalism
was retaliation for Archbishop Roger Mahony's opposition to the use
of condoms to prevent AIDS.
   Members of a group calling itself Greater Religious
Responsibility! claimed Sunday they had defaced the places of
worship with bright red paint, a color they said symbolizes the
blood of AIDS patients.
   Posters of Mahony were glued to the church entrances with
paraphrased excerpts from his recent policy statement such as,
``Safe sex is both a lie and a fraud.''
   Calls seeking comment went unanswered at the archbishop's office
and residence this morning.
   At St. Ambrose Catholic Church in West Hollywood, vandals
scrawled the word ``murderer'' beneath a photo of the archbishop,
said the Rev. John A. Beattie.
   A caller to KNBC-TV who said she was a member of the activist
group said the vandalism will continue until Mahony changes his
anti-condom stance. Another caller told the Los Angeles Times the
paint also denoted the tragedy of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``Someone dies of AIDS every 20 minutes in this country because
(Mahony's) policy is allowing that to continue unchecked,'' the
woman caller said.
   Mahony was chairman of a committee at the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops that rejected the use of condoms as a means of
fighting the spread of AIDS.
   In presenting the policy paper to the bishops, Mahony declared
that young people should avoid ``being trapped into the `safe-sex'
myth, which is both a lie and a fraud.''
   Beattie, who said at least 30 percent of his congregation is
gay, said he was saddened by the act of vandalism and believed the
archbishop's policy has been misinterpreted.
   ``St. Ambrose has done a lot to reach out to the gay community,
and why we should be singled out is a matter of confusion,'' he
said. ``The tenor of the archbishop's statement is one of
compassion for those with AIDS and of compassion for gays and
lesbians.''

   Police fired tear gas to disperse

   No arrests or injuries were reported.
   The protesters, mostly youthful Moslem fundamentalists, had
gathered Sunday to protest the City Council's failure to undertake

   They erected barricades across the main highways in the
Eucalyptus quarter of Algiers and rejected calls to disperse
peacefully, police said.
   Angry residents have staged similar protests, supported by

<TEXT>
   The Italian tire company Pirelli said Monday
it has signed an agreement to manufacture 5 million radial tires a
year in the Soviet Union.
   The deal, whose value was estimated at $535 million, came after
last week's Soviet accord with Italian automaker Fiat to build a
factory near Moscow.
   The Fiat plant is expected to produce up to 900,000 cars a year
by 1994.
   The letter of intent for the Italian-Soviet joint tire venture
was signed in Milan by Leopoldo Pirelli, chairman of the tire
company, and Nikolaj Lemaev, the Soviet minister for the chemical
industry.
   The Soviets will finance two-thirds of the venture, whose value
was not disclosed. Pirelli will finance one-third of the project.
   A Pirelli official said 85 percent of the yearly production of
tires will be sold in the Soviet Union and the rest on
international markets.
   The Pirelli deal was the latest signed in the wake of last
week's visit to Italy by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Pop Stars Re-Record Band Aid Song to Raise Famine Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop stars finished a new version of the 1984 hit
song ``Do They Know It's Christmas?'' early Monday to raise money
for African famine victims.
   More than a dozen singers ranging from Australian teen idol
Kylie Minogue to U.S. veteran Tina Turner worked into the early
hours to remake the Band Aid song that topped the charts in
Christmas 1984, organizers said.
   The single is expected to go on sale Dec. 11.
   The original record raised some $10 million for starving
Africans and spawned other projects including the transatlantic
Live Aid rock extravaganza on July 13, 1985 which brought in more
than $100 million.
   Millionaire pop-record producer Peter Waterman, who supervised
production of the new single at his London studios, said he was
considering organizing Live Aid II next year.
   ``First we have to bring the public's attention to the record,
then we will sit down just after Christmas and talk about a live
show,'' he said. ``It would be perfect timing.''
   Waterman lined up the pop stars and groups, including Cliff
Richard, Chris Rea, Bananarama, Bros, Jason Donovan and Tears for
Fears, after being approached by Irish rock singer Bob Geldof last
week. Geldof, who conceived the 1984 single, said he is keeping a
backstage role.
   ``The problem (in Africa) is the same, the song is the same, and
it's the same time of year,'' Geldof said. ``The only thing that
has changed is the faces in English pop music.''
   British aid workers recently back from Ethiopia said Monday that
scores of villagers in the war-ravaged northern province of Tigray
are dying of hunger. They urged Britons to dig into their pockets
to help avert a famine disaster.
   ``There is still time,'' said the Rev. John Parkin of Christian
Aid. ``We have about until the end of January before absolute
crisis hits us.''
   Up to 4 million people in Ethiopia are threatened with
starvation, aid agencies say.

<HEAD>Kibbutz Movement Accepts Bailout Plan for $3.6 Billion Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel's financially strapped collective farm
movement agreed to an austerity program including meatless meals
and fewer trips abroad under a government bailout of its $3.6
billion debt, a spokesman said Monday.
   The collective farms, a symbol of Israel's socialist pioneers,
also agreed to increase investment in light industry, said Shimon
Helman, spokesman for the United Kibbutz Movement.
   ``It's part of a trend,'' he said. ``We already produce far more
than the agricultural needs of the state, so we are looking for
profitable exports, like winter fruit and flowers to Western Europe
and light industry.''
   Kibbutzes were founded at the turn of the century by European
immigrants who believed hard work on collective farms would build a
unique Israeli character. But the movement's debts and aging
population have forced kibbutzes to invest in light industry, which
accounts for half of their profits.
   The movement also agreed to sell $20 million in assets,
including property in Tel Aviv, and ordered member farms to serve
two meatless meals a week as part of a 7 percent cutback in living
expenses, Helman said.
   Under the agreement, to be signed this week, the government will
write off $835 million in debts.
   It will offer tax breaks to banks to give the collective farms
25-year loans at 4.5 percent interest to cover the remainder of the
total debt.
   The plan was approved by the United Kibbutz Movement on Sunday.
The smaller Kibbutz Artzi movement accepted the program three weeks
ago.
   ``There was a tremendous amount of disagreement over whether to
accept the government offer,'' Helman said. ``It does not address
our future, the building of new kibbutzes, the absorption of new
immigrants or our pension plan.''
   Helman said many kibbutz members blamed the government for
creating the unfavorable exchange rates and high interest rates
that devastated kibbutz exports and helped cause the huge debt.
   Newspaper reports said Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of
the center-left Labor Party, put pressure on the movement to accept
the offer.
   The movment's 164 collective farms are affiliated with Labor,
while the Kibbutz Artzi movement's 84 collective farms are linked
to the socialist Mapam Party. The two groups have 110,000 members.
   Some members said they voted for the plan, which passed by a
300-32 vote, out of fear kibbutzes could fall under control of the
right-wing Likud bloc in the future. Likud has accused kibbutzes of
financial mismanagement and threatened to cut off aid.
   But Helman said he believed Likud also would agree to a bail-out
plan because of the food raised by the kibbutzes and the location
of many of them along Israel's borders.

   A Czechoslavak journal associated with the
democratic opposition was awarded an operating grant Monday from a
group of Western press associations that have established a new
project to assist East Bloc media.
   A $10,000 grant was awarded to the Prague journal Lidove Noviny
to assure two more months of publication, the press associations
said.
   Lidove Noviny, which is almost a century old, reappeared two
years ago as an underground journal of the Charter 77 human rights
movement and recently received official authorization to publish.
Its board of directors includes banned playwright Vaclav Havel.
   The grant was one of two announced to launch ``The East Europe
Aid Project'' of the Paris-based Fund Against Censorship.
   The Fund Against Censorship is a joint project of the Inter
American Press Association, the International Federation of
Newspaper Publishers, the International Federation of the
Periodical Press, the International Press Institute, the North
American National Broadcasters Association and the World Press
Freedom Comittee.
   A second grant of $10,000 went to the Polish newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza to cover the cost of shipping a printing press donated
last month by the French daily Le Monde. The press will allow the
daily to expand its press run and print supplements.

<TEXT>
   The National Bank of Poland devalued the
Polish zloty by 9.5 percent Monday, continuing a drive to create a
convertible currency that would encourage Western economic
investment.
   The new rate is 4,200 zlotys to the dollar, compared with 3,800
a week ago. The zloty was devalued similarly against other Western
currencies.
   The devaluation was the eighth since Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki took office in August as the first non-communist leader
in the East bloc and initiated a radical reformation of the
staggering Polish economy.
   Like other currencies in the East bloc, the zloty cannot be
freely exchanged with the hard currencies of the West and has a
value set by the government, not the money market.
   Poles can legally buy dollars at a less favorable but more
realistic market-driven exchange, known as the ``commercial'' rate,
at about 7,000 zlotys to the dollar.
   The government seeks to make the official and commercial rates
converge, possibly as soon as Jan. 1, giving the zloty a
convertible value that would ensure Western companies a way to
translate profits into other currencies.

   A 22-year tradition of father-son
banquets honoring the high school football team was canceled this
year after the quarterback said he wouldn't go if his mother
couldn't.
   ``A lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers,
but they couldn't come to our banquet,'' said Owa Brandstein,
quarterback for the team at Mohawk Trail Regional High School.
``It's blatant discrimination. It's just wrong.''
   Howard Binder, a co-founder of Friends of Mohawk, which was to
sponsor the Dec. 9 banquet, said Monday the banquet was canceled
after the guest list became an issue, both from the quarterback and
women who had approached School Committee members.
   ``The reason we went father and son was because the hall we held
it in wasn't big enough to hold a bigger crowd,'' he said. After
the requests were made to add to the guest list, the dinner, which
annually draws about 125 people, was canceled, he said. ``We just
didn't feel that we wanted to get that big.''
   The father-son banquet has been held since the Mohawk team was
co-champion in 1968. This year the team went 2-7.
   Brandstein's parents, Marcine and Stewart Eisenberg, said they
supported their son.
   ``We said to Owa, look, this is your only senior year. You don't
have to do this for us,'' said Eisenberg. ``He just said, `But it's
wrong.'''

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, you mentioned earlier that there was some
tension during the meetings and earlier, to reporters you had said
that there was no personal rancor. Could you outline the moments of
tension or tell us a little bit about the moments when you felt
there was tension between you and the Soviet leader?
   A. Yeah, I think where you don't have agreement, you can have
some _ some slight tension might result. I don't want to imply
there was great and dramatic moments of tension. Please, if I _ let
me clarify it if that's the impression I left. But we have a big
difference on how we look at Central America. And I would like to
see him use his influence with Mr. Castro, and if he's got any
left, with Mr. Ortega, to facilitate democratic change in the
Western Hemisphere. And I make clear, this isn't just the view of
the president of the United States, but it's the view of many
Americans and it's the view of Oscar Arias. So when you get into a
subject like that, where he may have a different formula, it's a
little more concentrated than when you're clicking off agreements
in some areas. Is there anybody here from a _ that's not accredited
to the White House, only because I don't want to be rude to the
foreign journalists? You're not a foreign journalist.
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. Who?
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. You are. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to him. Go
ahead, please.
   Q. Could I ask you to elaborate a little more on what you mean
by European Community integration _ greater European Community
integration?
   A. What?
   Q. You made a statement before _ in your statement, you referred
to European Community _ EC _ greater EC integration.
   A. Well, what I'm talking about is primarily on the economic
side. You're going to have enormous interchange between the East
and West. And what we're trying to do in the West and I think the
EC is trying to do it also, is to assist those countries that are
moving down the democratic path. The EC was charged out of our G-7
meeting in Paris to move forward on a coordinated economic approach
to help Hungary and Poland. And so it's in that area where I see
the earliest and the most productive integration.
   Way to the back on the aisle. Sir?
   Q. Mr. President, in the last two weeks of June, Mr. Gorbachev
will be in the USA for the summit. The very beginning of July the
G-7 will be meeting in Houston. Now you said in Malta that you
wanted to help steward or to help steer the Soviet Union into the
global economy. Is there a prospect that Mr. Gorbachev might stay
on for the G-7 summit, or _ (inaudible) _ that summit, why don't
you include some of the Eastern (inaudible)?
   A. The answer is, I don't think so. Put it this way, two
chances: slim and none for that _ for that particular meeting. Nor
did he request to be included in that particular meeting. But we're
in times of rapid change and we'll see how things move forward in
terms of having a common subject to discuss. You see, we've got to
_ got to understand his dilemma. They have not had a market
economy, they have not had the privatization that is _ that joins
the G-7 together. It's different. And so what I have proposed, and
as opposed to the suggestion _ the question you ask, is that we
work with them in observer status in the GATT eventually, as soon
as the Uruguay Round is over. Do more for him to do more with OECD.
It is important that not just the Soviet Union but other countries
in Eastern Europe understand the market economies, understand the
dynamism of the economic systems that join those seven countries.
So I don't think it's likely that, you know, that he would hang
around Houston waiting for the next meeting.
   Yeah, Robby?
   Q. Mr. President, you stepped aside on a question about the
``peace dividend'' and said that you've got a terrible Gramm-Rudman
problem next year. As you look at the changes in Europe and the
possibilities of further defense cuts, do you expect any time in
your first term to have a dividend, a ``peace dividend'' to apply
to some of the economic and social problems at home? And when would
you expect that?
   A. That's an awful tough question to answer about anytime. I
would think it would be extraordinarily difficult because of the _
of the _ not only the enormity of the Gramm-Rudman _ the difficulty
of reaching the Gramm-Rudman target this year, but what follows on.
And so what we are trying to do is emphasize the areas where we can
be of most help to the people through various programs. And I _ in
some areas _ I don't know whether Helen mentioned in her question,
education _ but in some areas it isn't necessarily _ the problem
isn't going to be solved by putting more money into it. But on your
question, as we go on down on the _ on meeting these Gramm-Rudman
targets, there just isn't a lot of, quote ``excess money,''
unquote, floating around there.
   Q. Not for the foreseeable future, not for the rest of your
first term?
   A. Well, look at the Gramm-Rudman targets that face us. I don't
want to hold out to those that want to rush out and spend a lot
more money the hope that that is going to happen. We've got some
tremendous economic problems that have to be solved. Because the
best answer to helping people, if you have to divide it _ have to
quantify it, the best is to have a job. And the best way to have
the climate for a job is to have a sound economy. And to our
foreign friends here, I'd say one of the things that would be the
best guarantee of that would be to get our federal deficits down.
It would also help us with investment. And that is the best poverty
program _ a job in the private sector. And so I can't _ I don't _ I
had a letter from a distinguished senator before I left, because he
had read about possible defense cuts, a reduction in the defense
budget, saying take that money and spend it for a cause that he
felt was very worthy. And I had to write him back and say, ``Look,
that isn't the way it's going to work.'' That isn't the way it's
going to work.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, you spoke in your opening statement about the
need for a greater role for the 35 nation group known as CSCE. You
know that in Rome, Chairman Gorbachev raised the possibility of a
new conference, Congress of Europe. I understand that didn't come
up in Malta.
   A. No, it didn't.
   Q. It did?
   A. No, it did not, you're right.

<HEAD>Thatcher Faces First Leadership Challenge in 14 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faces re-election
as Conservative Party leader Tuesday, and for the first time since
she got the job 14 years ago, she has a challenger.
   Sir Anthony Meyer, a rank-and-file legislator little known
outside Parliament, doesn't expect to win. But he hopes to get
enough votes to send Mrs. Thatcher a message of discontent at a
time of 7.3 percent inflation and difficulties over Britain's place
in Europe.
   Former Defense Secretary George Younger, Mrs. Thatcher's
campaign manager, said Monday that out of the 374 Conservative
members of Parliament eligible to cast ballots, he expected up to
20 will vote for Meyer.
   Some are expected to abstain in a show of disapproval of Mrs.
Thatcher's sometimes autocratic leadership style, and her
reluctance to accept some of the new rules dictated by Britain's
membership in the European Economic Community.
   Tory lawmaker Christopher Hawkins says estimates of
anti-Thatcher votes and abstentions range from 23 to 66, with an
average prediction of 45.
   Forty-five would do Mrs. Thatcher little harm. Analysts agree it
would take 100 or more to wound her, and no one expects her to lose
outright. Early guesses are tricky, because many members have
refused to state their preference before they put their votes in
the ballot box.
   The waverers face a dilemma: they want to send her a message,
but not such an overwhelming one that she will feel obliged to
resign.
   Conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader, and Mrs.
Thatcher, 64, has been endorsed without opposition since 1975 when
she ousted former Prime Minister Ted Heath.
   She has led the Conservative to three successive election
victories since 1979, become the longest-serving British prime
minister this century, and said she wants to go on and on.
   But public opinion polls show she is the least popular prime
minister this century, her Tories are up to 15 points behind the
opposition Labor Party, and her sweeping economic and social
reforms have gone too far for many voters.
   ``While the rich have become richer in the past 10 years, the
poor have become poorer,'' said Meyer, a 69-year-old former
diplomat who represents a Welsh constituency and has always been on
the liberal anti-Thatcher wing of the party.
   ``There is a real limit on the extent to which the electorate is
prepared to tolerate public squalor, whether in filthy streets,
worsening public transport or inadequate schools or hospitals in
return for private affluence,'' he said Monday.
   Younger said in a weekend television interview that Meyer
wrongly believes ``there is a vast groundswell who want him to do
this. I'm afraid the truth is there isn't and people mostly would
very much wish he hadn't.''
   To be reelected on the first ballot, Mrs. Thatcher needs 57
percent of the 374 eligible votes _ a majority plus 15 percent. If
she fails, up to two more ballots can be held until a winner
emerges on a simply majority of 188 votes.
   The victor becomes party leader and prime minister, subject only
to the formality of royal approval.
   The Conservatives hold 375 of the 650 seats in the House of
Commons, but Speaker Bernard Weatherill does not vote.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has a vote, said last week the leadership
vote was bad for Britain and for the party, but she defended
Meyer's democratic right to challenge her.
   Opinion polls consistently have named another former defense
secretary, Michael Heseltine, as the person voters would most like
to replace Mrs. Thatcher.
   Meyer has said he mounted the challenge not in any hope of
winning, but as a way of enticing more likely candidates into the
race.
   However Heseltine has repeatedly said he won't participate in
the campaign to unseat Mrs. Thatcher, although he has not indicated
whether he will cast a ballot or abstain Tuesday.

   Q. But even though it didn't, it's an important suggestion, and
I wonder how you feel about it.
   A. Well, I feel about it that I have a _ with respect to him, an
even more important suggestion. And that is that we sign a CFE
agreement. There's something that's very practical, that's very
much within our grasp. And I think that should be our prime
objective for that kind of a meeting.
   Yeah, Carl?
   Q. Chairman Gorbachev said yesterday that you and he agreed in
your talks that the world _ that the Malta meeting marked the end
of the epoch of the Cold War and entering a new period. Do you
agree with him that the Cold War is over?
   A. Carl, let me tell you something. (Laughter). We're fooling
with semantics here. I don't want to give you a headline. I've told
you the areas where I think we have progress. Why do we resort to
these code words that send different signals to different people?
I'm not going to answer. I can. ...
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. Well, good. He can speak for himself very _ in a very
eloquent way. But in terms of if you want me to define it _ is the
Cold War the same _ I mean, is it raging like it was before in the
times of the Berlin Blockade? Absolutely not. Things have moved
dramatically. But if I signal to you there's no Cold War, then
you'll say, ``Well, what are you doing with troops in Europe?'' I
mean, come on!
   Yeah, Maureen?
   Q. (A question from a Soviet journalist).
   A. Is your name ``Maureen,'' sir?
   Q. I am from Izvestia newspaper.
   A. (Laughs). _ named ``Maureen.'' Go ahead.
   (Laughter.)
   Q. Mr. President, what is your reaction to Chairman Gorbachev's
proposal that NATO and the Warsaw Pact should not remain yet
military alliances, but rather become military-political alliances,
and later on just political alliances? Can you envisage in the
future any form of cooperation between the two alliances?
   A. Well, I can see an economic interaction. And I hope that NATO
will, along with the EC and along with OECD and these other areas,
will take more of an active East-West role in the economy, in
helping each other in terms of systems. But he did not press that
point with me at all. I think he envisions an active U.S. presence
in Europe, in one way or another.
   Maureen, yes?
   Q. Mr. President, after five hours of talks on Saturday, despite
extremely treacherous seas, and you even had trouble getting to the
talks, you got back in your launch and went back to your ship. Mr.
President, why did you do that? And. ...
   A. Because I wanted to go back in time to receive him for dinner.
   Q. Didn't you understand you were risking the summit, number
one? And number two, what do you think Gorbachev thinks of your
judgment?
   A. Maureen, you've been to Maine. Don't tell me that that little
chop was _ (laughter) _ was risking anything. Frankly, I haven't
had that much fun in a long time, either. But the fact that we got
out there and the seas kicked up even more _ the winds were up to
60 knots _ that's a big _ 60 miles an hour, 50 knots, which is a
big wind, and along with it came a swell, and along with it came a
chop. But we didn't miss a beat. In fact, we had a very relaxed
evening out there, and then showed up and we got eight hours of
talks in. So it was a _ that was a non-issue, and I didn't feel
there was any risk in getting into a little safe launch like that
and going back out to the ship. It was sheer pleasure, really.
   Q. And it was hot-dogging?
   A. Hot-dogging? No. (Laughter).
   Well, you know, these charismatic, macho, visionary guys _
they'll do anything. (Laughter).
   Yeah.
   This is the last question. I've got to go. I've got to go home.
   Q. Mr. President, a few moments ago, you questioned whether
Gorbachev had any influence at all over Daniel Ortega. Yet in his
news conference yesterday, Chairman Gorbachev indicated that there
may be an opportunity now for peace in the region. Did he indicate
to you in any way whether, one, he had any control over Ortega, or,
two, whether there was something in the works that may lead to some
kind of peaceful political. ...
   A. No, he didn't, but I think _ he didn't indicate whether he
had any control over him. What he did indicate was that there were
going to be free elections. And I told him, that's fine _ to have
those free elections _ but they've got to be fair. You have to have
access from _ for the minorities to _ minority parties and the
opposition party, the UNO, to get in there and participate _ a full
access. And so we had a little discussion of that. But that was
about it.
   Q. To follow up, if he indicated there would be free elections,
that in turn would indicate that he does in fact maintain some sort
of influence on Ortega. And then wouldn't you hold him further
responsible to stop that flow of arms in El Salvador?
   A. Well, I'm not sure that _ I don't see quite the logic, that
if he says there's going to be a free election that means he
controls them. I'm unclear on your. ...
   Q. How could he _ how could he assure you that there would be
free elections?
   A. I don't _ oh, excuse me _ I don't think he assured me there
was. He just says free elections are scheduled. And I told him how
important we felt it was that they go forward.
   I am told that our congressional delegation, made up of some
who've been rather generous in their comments about what the
Sandinistas were about, or at least were less than supportive
historically for the Contras, were on this delegation, and that the
delegation was denied the right to come in and take a look. And I
told him this is counterproductive. This doesn't help. And so _but
I don't want to imply from that, that he can _he can just snap his
fingers and have Mr. Ortega _ I think he was _ do what he said.
   I think he was impressed _ I may be wrong, but I _I think he was
impressed by the message from Oscar Arias. And I asked Arias if it
was okay to tell him of the call, and he said, yes, I hope you
will. So when I said this man, this Nobel Prize winner _ prize
winner down there _ who _ with whom we've had some differences,
though normally we're in pretty good sync _ appeals to you, ``Use
your influence to, you know, stop the export of revolution,'' it
may have made an impact.
   I really do have to run. It's supposed to be out of here at, for
those who are flying with us, at quarter of, and it's now fourteen
of. No, wait a minute _ twelve of. What's the big hand here? I'm
getting a little tired. (Audience laughter.) Thank you.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Government's Power to Fine Polluters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether the federal government's delays in setting clean-air
guidelines limit its power to fine polluters.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by General Motors,
which faces fines of up to $25,000 a day for violating air-quality
standards at a Massachusetts car-assembly plant.
   A lower court rejected GM's claims that it should be shielded
from fines because of federal delays on proposed revisions in state
pollution controls.
   The public should not be penalized with dirtier air because of
what often are unavoidable delays by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to consider limiting the federal government's power to
control water used by hydroelectric dams. The court said it will
hear a California appeal supported by more than 40 states.
   _Refused to enhance the power of states and their citizens to
block shipments of hazardous waste from other states. The court
rejected an appeal by Alabama officials who failed to prevent
shipments of hazardous waste from an abandoned Texas chemical
refinery.
   _Agreed to decide whether U.S. banks with branch offices
overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or
freeze those accounts. The court will review a ruling that required
Citibank to pay depositors.
   Robert H. Bork, whose Supreme Court nomination was defeated by
the Senate in 1987, is representing Citibank.
   _Left intact a victory for rock star Prince by refusing to
revive a copyright-infringement claim by his half-sister over the
hit song ``U Got The Look.''
   The air-pollution case involves a GM plant in Framingham, Mass.,
and focuses on the joint federal-state system for cleaning up the
atmosphere.
   Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national air
quality standards and states must adopt plans to meet those
standards.
   The EPA in 1980 approved a Massachusetts plan for reducing
pollution from paint at auto-assembly factories. The plan required
car makers to comply fully with the federal rules by Dec. 31, 1985.
   But EPA officials extended the deadline for any plant switching
from lacquer to enamel paints, which emit less pollutants.
   GM initially planned to stay with lacquer at the Framingham
factory but in June 1985 announced it would convert to enamel paint
by the summer of 1987. GM asked that it not be required to comply
with the Dec. 31, 1985, standards until 20 months later.
   Massachusetts officials approved GM's proposal and submitted a
revised plan to the EPA on Dec. 30, 1985.
   Without waiting for federal approval, GM began building a $200
million plant in Framingham to use enamel-based paints while
continuing to operate its existing factory.
   EPA officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines
of up to $25,000 a day against GM for 20 months of air-quality
violations at the old plant. But it was not until September 1988
that the EPA rejected the state-approved pollution-control system
at the new plant.
   A federal judge barred the EPA from fining GM for violations of
the Dec. 31, 1985, standards, ruling that the federal agency itself
violated the Clean Air Act by taking more than four months to rule
on the state-approved plan submitted Dec. 30, 1985.
   But the 1st Circuit court last June said the EPA's failure to
meet the four-month deadline does not disqualify it from fining
companies that violate previously approved pollution-control rules.
   The appeals court told the trial judge to decide how much the
fines should be, advising him to consider whether the EPA's delay
was reasonable and what impact the delay had on GM.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined GM in urging the Supreme
Court to review the dispute.
   Chamber of Commerce lawyers said the 1st Circuit court ruling
invites unfair treatment for businesses. The Bush administration
said the 1st Circuit court ruling was correct.

   A correspondent for a Spanish-language radio

all right and is expected home in Dallas tonight, the network said.
   Sal Valdez, 44, operations manager and a reporter for
Dallas-based Cadena Radio Centro had been missing from San Salvador
since Nov. 28.
   A statement from network president Barrett Alley said, ``We are
extremely grateful to receive word that Sal Valdez appears to be
all right and will be returning to Dallas this evening.''
   ``Due to security reasons, we have no more information at this
time. As soon as Sal is debriefed, we will have a full release and
statement as to his disappearance.''
   Network controller Bill Cherry said he could only say that
Valdez called someone this morning.
   Hispanic groups in Dallas had planned a vigil for Valdez this
evening in City Hall Plaza.
   Valdez, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen, arrived in El Salvador Nov.
25 to report on the latest outbreak in that country's civil war and
interviewed top officials including President Alfredo Cristiani.

   The skipper of the USS Iowa will testify next
Monday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the April 19
blast that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship, the panel
announced Monday.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally will answer questions at the panel's
second hearing. It heard testimony last month from Rear Adm.
Richard Milligan who oversaw the Navy's technical and criminal
investigation of the blast.
   The Navy concluded in its Sept. 7 report that gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting
some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the
ship's 16-inch guns. Hartwig was among those killed.
   In his testimony before the Senate committee, Milligan said that
additional technical tests conducted since the report found
``unique foreign material'' that would not have been present during
a normal firing.
   The new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with
calcium, chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by ``some
types of non-electronic explosive devices,'' Milligan said.
   The House Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, has scheduled
hearings on the Iowa incident Dec. 12 and 13 with witnesses from
the Navy and the FBI.

<TEXT>
   The trial of two dissidents who
illegally visited communist North Korea erupted in a melee Monday
with their supporters shouting anti-government slogans and
scuffling with courtroom guards.
   About 50 people were expelled from a courthouse after they
shouted slogans and greeted the two dissidents by showering them
with confetti and paper airplanes.
   Radical student leader Im Su-kyong and dissident Catholic priest
Moon Gyu-hyon stood impassively as screaming supporters, friends
and relatives were forced from the courtroom by guards.
   ``Repeal National Security Law!'' protesters shouted, raising
clenched fists as they were taken away. Some protesters traded
punches with guards as they were hauled from the courtroom kicking
and screaming.
   The incident began as soon as the two defendants were led into
the courtroom for the third day of hearings in their trial. About
200 supporters, many of them students, shouted slogans demanding
their release.
   Senior judge Hwang Sang-hyon adjourned the hearing and ordered
about 40 people expelled. Another 10 were ordered out when they
protested, shouting slogans and insults.
   Outside the courthouse, police arrested 21 people, mostly
college students, for either demonstrating in support of the two
dissidents or trying to carry confetti into the courtroom.
   Miss Im and Moon were charged with making illegal trips to North
Korea. If convicted, they could be sentenced to as many as 10 years
in prison under the National Security Law.
   Miss Im, a 20-year-old junior majoring in French at Seoul's
Hankook University of Foreign Studies, traveled to the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang without government authorization to attend a
July 1-8 world youth festival.
   Moon, a U.S.-educated clergyman, was sent to North Korea by a
group of dissident Catholic priests to escort Miss Im home. Both
were arrested upon returning to South Korea through the border
village of Panmunjom Aug. 15.
   Both claimed their trips were intended to help reunite the
Korean peninsula, divided in 1945.
   But prosecutors have presented evidence showing the pair making
speeches in North Korea, criticizing South Korea and the United
States. The two called South Korea ``a colony of the U.S.
imperialists.''
   In a separate trial Monday, a criminal court sentenced the Rev.
Nam Kuk-hyon, a dissident Catholic priest, to two years'
imprisonment, suspended for three years, for playing a leading role
in sending Moon to North Korea.

<TEXT>
   Red Cross officials from South Korea
and North Korea met Monday but failed to agree on terms for
exchanging separated family members before the end of the year,
reports said.
   Both sides agreed to continue discussing possible family visits
through a telephone hotline linking Seoul and Pyongyang, the two
Korean capitals, according to the South Korean news agency, Yonhap.
   North Korea and South Korea have been trying to arrange a
four-day exchange of families that would be only the second such
exchange in four decades.
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.
About 10 million family members were separated by the 1945 division
of their land and the Korean War.
   Monday's 50-minute meeting was the seventh since September and
was called by North Korea. It was the first closed-door session and
foreign press was barred. Ten Korean news reporters were invited to
cover the talks.
   The two nations initially agreed to exchange more than 500
separated family members and entertainers for a four-day visit
starting Dec. 8, but talks broke down when North Korea insisted on
broadcasting a three-hour revolutionary opera written by North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung on South Korean TV. South Korean
officials rejected the demand as a propaganda ploy.
   Yonhap quoted chief South Korean delegate Song Young-dae as
saying after Monday's meeting that both sides confirmed it would be
impossible to exchange family members before the end of this year.
   Song urged North Korea to cooperate to carry out the family
exchange early next year, Yonhap said.
   The chief North Korean delegate, Pak Yong Su, left the
conference room without answering questions by reporters, Yonhap
said.

   With tongue firmly in cheek.
   The president was asked at his news conference Monday if he

   ``You've been to Maine,'' Bush told the reporter. ``Don't tell

   At his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Bush relaxes by driving
his 28-foot Cigarette boat into ocean waves, the power boater's

   Steroid use may build strength and add weight, he said, but
taking the drugs also increases health risks. Sammartino said the
benefits aren't worth the possible damage to the heart, liver and
kidneys.
   ``The problem is that you still hear a doctor now and then
saying there haven't been enugh studies to really know if they're
all that harmful,'' Sammartino said.

   A French court ruled Monday that
actress Brigitte Bardot was justified in ordering a gardener to
castrate Charly, a donkey left in her care and put out to graze
with an old mare.
   The court said that the donkey's owner, Jean-Pierre Manivet,
``created a false notoriety'' around the case, and fined him the
equivalent of $3,300 to be donated to the animal protection
foundation that bears the actress's name.
   Miss Bardot, an animal-rights activist once known as the ``sex
kitten'' for her bare appearances in French films, lives here in a
large villa surrounded by animals.
   Manivet left Charly with Miss Bardot's gardener in June. But
Miss Bardot said that the donkey's amorous interest in her
32-year-old mare Duchess was excessive and she feared mating could
be fatal for the old horse.

   Comedian Redd Foxx says he has been
``whitelisted'' and blames racism for his current problems with the
Internal Revenue Service.
   Foxx's home was raided a week ago by IRS agents who took cars,
furniture, clothing and some of his jewelry.
   The seizures were made to pay $755,166.21 in back taxes for the
years 1983, 1984 and 1986, the IRS said. The agency said Foxx had
ignored four notices sent to him to make payment.
   Foxx said he has been ``whitelisted, whiteballed.''
   The black comic said the term blackballed doesn't apply to him,
because ``nobody black hurt me.''
   The entertainer said in an interview published Sunday that the
IRS raid was carried out by members of the white establishment.
   ``There have got to be some whites in town that owe taxes,''
Foxx said. ``Why don't they go to their houses and tear it up and
throw stuff all around the floor? Because they got big attorneys
and know that before they go, who's representing you.''
   Foxx, the star of the 1970s TV series ``Sanford and Son,'' filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983, citing $1.6 million
owed the IRS from taxes prior to 1983 and more than $800,000 owed
other creditors.
   Foxx, who lives here, is currently appearing at the Hacienda
Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

   Playing a woman who is losing her grip on reality
is ``one of the hardest things I've ever had to do,'' says Martha
Plimpton, an actress for 11 of her 19 years.
   Plimpton, daughter of actors Keith Carradine and Shelley
Plimpton, appeared in the movie ``Parenthood'' and had multiple
roles in the Seattle Repertory Theater production of ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' last month.
   ``Working in films lets you get lazy. Your style of acting
becomes so naturalistic, so simple, so plain. There's not a lot of
work involved,'' she said.
   She opens Wednesday in the repertory's production of ``Robbers''
by Lyle Kessler.
   ``The lines don't just come from one place,'' Plimpton said of
her new role. ``They skip from here to there. What's going on in
her head is very crazy.''
   The character appears one moment in a kimono, another in a
wedding dress.
   ``It's very difficult to play a crazy person. It's one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do,'' Plimpton said. ``It's the
first time I've ever done anything I didn't completely understand.''

   Security agents stood guard today outside the
offices of former disgraced Communist leaders to safeguard
documents and other evidence that could be used in investigations
of high-level corruption.
   Wolfgang Schwanitz, the national security chief, barred all
flights to Romania following reports that sensitive material was
being smuggled out of the country to the hard-line Warsaw Pact ally.
   Members of the largest opposition group demanded a referendum on
German reunification and urged the government to allow quick free
elections. One spokesman said Communist leaders had ``lost all
legitimacy.''
   Premier Hans Modrow, a Communist reformer, emerged as the
country's No. 1 political leader after the entire party leadership
resigned in disgrace Sunday and left a 25-member committee in
control of the government.
   Protests continued despite the resignations.
   ``We don't need any Politburo and Central Committee that is made
up of criminals!'' one woman screamed at a rally of about 10,000
people Sunday night in East Berlin ``This should have happened long
ago!'' a man shouted.
   The official ADN news agency said security agents were stationed
outside party offices in East Berlin to prevent former members of
the Politburo and Central Committee from gaining access to
documents in file cabinets and safes.
   Agents also stood guard outside official guest houses following
growing public resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the former
leadership, it said. The security measures were aimed at keeping
valuables and possibly documents that might be used as evidence
from being removed.
   Several former leaders have been accused in a growing corruption
investigation of abusing their powers and stealing money from the
state.
   Modrow, the 61-year-old reformer and former Dresden party chief,
led East Germany's delegation at the Warsaw Pact summit that began
in Moscow today, ADN reported.
   Also attending the summit were Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer
and Egon Krenz, who resigned as party chief Sunday along with the
party's 10-member ruling Politburo and its entire 163-member
Central Committee.
   Krenz went to the Moscow meeting in the largely ceremonial role
of head of state. ADN mentioned no further role for him.
   Just two months ago, the party's hierarchy enforced iron-fisted
rule. Now, the former ruling elite has its back against the wall as
demands grow for punishment of those who lived in style while East
Germany sank into crisis.
   Modrow, elected premier Nov. 13 by a Parliament that broke with
the discredited Communists, now appears in charge of day-to-day
affairs, and official newspapers predicted an imminent split in the
Communist Party.
   Public resentment of the ruling Communists has reached a fever
pitch and Modrow is seen as more acceptable than the ousted
authoritarian leadership that long shunned him.
   Many of the party's rank-and-file are disgusted with the high
life the ousted elite is reported to have enjoyed.
   In Sunday's housecleaning, Erich Honecker, Krenz's predecessor
as party leader, and 11 other members of the hard-line Old Guard
were expelled from the party; three former Politburo members were
arrested on corruption charges; and the country's chief of trade
with the West fled.
   The pressure on the party increased today, with the opposition
group New Forum demanding a law allowing quick free elections.
   The group, with 200,000 members, also urged a national
referendum to decide on German reunification. There have been
growing calls to reunite the two Germanys, but New Forum previously
had warned against such suggestions.
   A statement signed by New Forum leaders Claus Gerd Scheidig and
Christiane Paetzold said the long-term possibility of one German
state within present borders of the two countries was ``no longer
an unthinkable utopia.''
   The statement urged all New Forum organizations to press for a
quick a referendum to find out ``what the real wish of the people''
was on the issue of reunification.
   West Germany claims that most East Germans want reunification,
but there have been no opinion polls or other indications of how
East Germans feel about the issue.
   Among the reformers named Sunday to the new 25-member Communist
Party committee are Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and the
country's former spy chief, Markus Wolf.
   A spokesman for the committee, Gregor Gysi, said its immediate
task would be to investigate corruption among the discredited
Communist elite.
   The committee will effectively rule as the party prepares for a
special congress on Dec. 15, when it is expected to choose new
leaders.
   Several hundred thousand people joined hands to form ``human
chains'' in sections across the country Sunday and displayed signs
calling for the removal of the ``Central Committee mafia'' and
imprisonment for ex-party ``criminals.''
   The party that has ruled East Germany for all its 40 years has
already abolished its guaranteed monopoly on power and promised
free elections for as early as next year.
   Krenz was not named to the new reform committee. His was the
shortest reign of any East German leader.
   Responding to massive protest demonstrations, Krenz opened the
Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 and promised reforms including free
elections, but calls increased for his removal because of his past
links to Honecker's rule.
   Guenter Schabowski, among those ousted from the Politburo, said
the 12 expelled Sunday were suspected of ``serious violations of
party statutes.'' Among those thrown out were ex-Premier Willi
Stoph and former Parliament speaker Horst Sindermann.

   More than 100 people were arrested this morning
for blockading a federal building to protest U.S. aid to the
government of El Salvador, police said.
   All 112 were given summonses for disorderly conduct and two also
were charged with resisting arrest, said Officer Janice Swinney, a
police spokeswoman.
   The protest began with an interfaith service about 7:30 a.m. in
lower Manhattan, said Michael D'Elia, a spokesman for the Emergency
Coalition for Peace in El Salvador.
   About 250 people, including Roman Catholic nuns and other clergy
members, then moved to the main entrance to the building and began
a blockade about 8 a.m., he said. The demonstration was over about
an hour later.
   ``We were protesting the violence that the U.S. government is
supporting in El Salvador by sending hundreds of millions of
dollars annually to a government that Amnesty International,
Americas Watch and other human rights organizations have repeatedly
condemned as one of the worst human rights violators in the
world,'' D'Elia said.
   El Salvadoran security forces, who are battling leftist rebels,
have in recent weeks raided several churches and were blamed by
some for last month's killing of six Jesuit priests from the
country's Central American University.

   The Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact
nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform
movement today condemned the action.
   The statement came as East bloc leaders, including the first
non-communist head of state, met for a Warsaw Pact meeting to hear
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's report on his recent talks with
President Bush.
   The leaders of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany
and Poland said the entrance of their troops into Czechoslovakia 21
years ago constitituted ``interference in the internal affairs of a
sovereign Czechoslovakia and must be condemned.''
   ``Interrupting the process of democratic renewal in
Czechoslovakia, these unjustified actions had long-term negative
consequences,'' added the statement, which was read on the evening
news and carried by the official Tass news agency.
   The Soviet-led invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of
Alexander Dubcek, who was subsequently ousted as the Communist
Party leader. He has since re-emerged as one of the spokespeople of
the pro-democracy movement sweeping Czechoslovakia.
   Meanwhile, President Bush was in Brussels briefing NATO leaders
on the summit. Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said Bush
told the allies he and Gorbachev agreed ``to propose to their
allies ... a meeting of government leaders at the signing of an
agreement on conventional disarmament.''
   The leaders meeting in Moscow included Wojciech Jaruzelski,
Poland's Communist president, and Egon Krenz of East Germany, who
resigned as his country's Communist Party chief Sunday along with
the rest of the Politburo but retained the ceremonial post of
president.
   The East German news agency ADN said Premier Hans Modrow headed
the nation's delegation.
   Tass did not mention the arrival of Poland's Solidarity Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-communist East bloc
leader to attend a Warsaw Pact meeting since the alliance was
created in 1955 in response to the formation of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   Mazowiecki's participation highlights the radical changes that
have occurred recently in Eastern Europe.
   Tass said Gorbachev would tell the allies of his weekend talks
in Malta with Bush but it did not say when the Soviet leader would
address the meeting.
   Tass announced earlier that Western journalists would not be
accredited for the meeting and said they would have to depend on
state-run Soviet media for reports.
   The Warsaw Pact last held a meeting in July in Romania. Since
then, there have been dramatic political changes in many of the
member countries and calls for reforms within the pact itself.
   East Germay's longtime leader Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18
after thousands of citizens fled to the West and others staged mass
protests for reforms. Krenz replaced Honecker, and on Nov. 9 his
government bowed to continued pressure and opened East Germany's
borders to allow people to travel freely.
   It also was the first Warsaw Pact meeting for Petar Mladenov of
Bulgaria and Karel Urbanek of Czechoslovakia.
   Mladenov replaced ousted Bulgarian party chief Todor Zhivkov on
Nov. 10, and Urbanek replaced Czechoslovak leader Milos Jakes on
Nov. 24. Zhivkov and Jakes fell after similar pro-democracy
demonstrations in their countries, and their replacements pledged
reforms.
   The official Bulgarian news agency BTA said Mladenov would stay
on in Moscow after the Warsaw Pact summit on a visit at the
invitation of the Soviet Communist Party.
   In Bucharest, official Romanian media reported that President
Nicolae Ceausescu headed his nation's delegation to the meeting.
Ceausescu has rejected calls for reform.

<HEAD>New-Home Sales Off But Analysts Predict Some Improvement</HEAD>

   Sales of new homes fell 0.5 percent in
October, the government reported Monday. Analysts said overall
purchases were driven down by a 24.7 percent decline in the West
due to the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake and the effects of the
slowing economy.
   But economists said the sales pace should improve somewhat over
the next few months as mortgage interest rates drop to the mid-9
percent range. No analyst predicted a surge in sales.
   ``The report says that housing market activity has improved some
from the sluggish pace of March and February, but that the market
is by no means taking off,'' Thomas Holloway, senior economist for
the Mortgage Bankers Association, said.
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649,000 in October
following a revised 10.2 percent plunge in September. September
sales originally were reported down 14 percent.
   Sales in the West fell 53,000 units on an annual basis to
161,000 homes. But all other regions posted gains, prompting David
Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, to conclude ``the earthquake appeared to keep people
from buying new homes.''
   Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of
Home Builders, said economic sluggishness also contributed to the
lack of western sales. Part of the problem, he said, was slower
defense spending, which resulted in significant layoffs.
   Home sales had fallen dramatically earlier this year as the
Federal Reserve Board pumped up interest rates to slow the economy
and thus contain inflation. As inflationary pressures cooled,
however, the Fed has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the
beginning of the summer.
   Fixed-rate mortgage interest rates fell to an average of 9.82
percent by the end of October after rising into the double digits
in September, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Despite the lower interest rates, Michael P. Niemira, an
economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said ``the new home
market appears to be hurt by the ever-widening gap between new and
existing home prices.
   ``Builders also appear to be misreading the current market,'' he
said. ``It is a market for low-priced homes and builders generally
are not building for that market.''
   The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home in
October rose 5.3 percent to $127,900. The median means half of the
homes cost more and half less. The average price of a new home was
unchanged at $151,900.
   On the other hand, the National Association of Realtors reported
Monday that the median price of an existing single-family home was
$92,100.
   New home sales in the Northeast rose 47.8 percent but Fannie
Mae's Berson said that reflected a low September sales count rather
than growing market strength in the area.
   The South posted a 5.7 percent increase, while the Midwest
recorded a 3.7 percent gain.
   New-home sales for the first nine months were down 4.4 percent
from the same period in 1988.
   In its report, the real estate trade group said that its index
measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy an
existing home rose in October to its highest level in eight months
because of stable mortgage rates and a drop in the median home
price.
   The real estate group said the index rose to 106.1, from 103.5
in September and was the highest since it was 106.7 last February.
That means a family with a median income of $33,365 had 106.1
percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home
costing $92,100.

   President Bush said Monday his meeting
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave the two leaders a chance to cement a
personal relationship, though ``it wasn't all sweetness and light.''
   In a news conference before leaving Europe _ after briefing the
NATO allies on his summit talks with Gorbachev _ Bush summed up his
own new relationship with the Soviet president, forged in the
stormy waters off Malta during their weekend of talks aboard a
Soviet cruise ship.
   ``What happened was, I think he took my measure and I took his,
and I think we just feel more comfortable about our common
objectives,'' said Bush.
   He hedged a bit when asked if he considered the Soviet leader a
personal friend. That they had ``friendly conversations,'' was as
far as he would go.
   But Bush made clear that Gorbachev had made an impression on him.
   ``I feel I can sense much more clearly the things he feels more
strongly about. And we had a good chance to point out to him some
of the difficulties with our relationship. It wasn't all sweetness
and light,'' said the president.
   In their private sessions aboard the Maxim Gorky, anchored
firmly to harbor against the harsh December storm, Gorbachev was
less openly emotional than when he presided buoyantly with Bush on
Sunday over the first joint news conference for Soviet and American
leaders.
   In public, Gorbachev felt free to joke about his summit partner,
talking of the importance of ``cautiousness _ and I use the
favorite word by President Bush.''
   Gorbachev also praised the Malta meeting enthusiastically,
saying it had placed his relationship with Bush ``on a different
level.''
   Bush said, ``As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has
handled the changes in Eastern Europe, it deserves new thinking. It
absolutely mandates new thinking.''
   Noting Gorbachev's willingness to consider disproportionate
troop withdrawals from Europe and his support for peaceful change
and a right of Warsaw Pact countries to make their own choices,
Bush said that he and the Western allies feel ``a certain respect
for what he's doing and thus, we want to try to meet him on some of
the areas where he needs help.''
   In the Malta talks, Bush said, ``He seemed very much in control.
You can tell the way that he interacted with his own top people
there. He felt very confident in discussing without notes a wide
array of subjects with me.''
   ``He seemed _ `subdued' is the wrong word, but I would say
determined and unemotional about it. The most emotion we saw was at
that press conference yesterday, but it was a wonderful
presentation,'' said Bush.
   The two leaders didn't resolve U.S. grievances over the actions
of Soviet-backed governments and rebels in Central America, but
even there Bush sounded a more conciliatory note than he had before.
   He spoke at length of Gorbachev's support for free elections in
Nicaragua, and said he felt the Soviet leader was ``impressed by
the message from Oscar Arias,'' the Costa Rican president who
relayed a complaint about a ``destructive role'' by Fidel Castro's
Cuba in the Western Hemisphere.
   Even on Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, long a nemesis of
U.S. policy, Bush sounded an understanding note about what he
portrayed as Gorbachev's limited influence over a government that
receives massive support from the Kremlin.
   Bush said he did not want to imply that Gorbachev ``can just
snap his fingers and have Mr. Ortega ... do what he said.''

   The Voice of America, the U.S.
government's broadcast service, opened its second Soviet bloc
bureau Monday and launched discussions with Polish state radio on
the exchange of programming.
   ``They were jamming us two years ago,'' said VOA Director
Richard W. Carlson.
   To mark the opening of the Poland bureau, VOA and Polish Radio
prepared a live Monday night program permitting callers in Poland
to discuss their country's economic situation with Polish-speaking
experts in Washington, Chicago, New York and Warsaw.
   ``This is unheard of given the context of our journalistic
relationship with this country so recently,'' Carlson said. ``It is
definitely amazing. We did not envision this at all.''
   VOA, which broadcasts in 43 languages to an estimated 130
million people worldwide, for years was jammed by East bloc
countries and denounced by their leaders. VOA correspondents were
denied visas to work in Eastern Europe or given only limited access.
   Jamming has ended in the Soviet bloc in recent years, Carlson
said, and VOA opened a Moscow bureau last year.
   VOA, heard by an estimated 50 percent of Poland's adults at
least once a week, was given permanent accreditation in Poland in
April, Carlson said.
   No full-time correspondent has been assigned due to budget
constraints, but the Warsaw bureau will be staffed on a rotating
basis by reporters stationed elsewhere.
   A Warsaw bureau also is being established by Radio Free Europe,
another long-time propaganda enemy for its uncensored reports to
Eastern Europe.
   The strict state control of Polish radio and TV loosened in
1988. The Solidarity-led government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who
became the East bloc's first non-communist leader in August, has
vowed to free the flow of information.
   On Nov. 13, Polish Radio ran a live broadcast, provided by the
VOA, of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's speech to the U.S. Congress.
   VOA, which produces six hours of live Polish-language reports
daily from Washington headquarters, will continue talks with Polish
authorities on placing its programming on state radio, Carlson said.
   Also being discussed are exchanges of broadcasters and training
programs, Carlson said.
   VOA correspondents are being welcomed elsewhere in Eastern
Europe as well.
   Hungary offers virtually free access, and Czechoslovakia has
provided ongoing accreditaion for Czech and English-language
correspondents, said William Hill, chief of the VOA European
Division.
   Bulgaria recently allowed a VOA representative to cover an
environmental forum. And after 18 visa denials during three years,
a VOA correspondent was accredited for East Germany's 40th
anniversary events attended by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Hill said.
   Only Romania and Albania continue to bar the correspondents,
with Romania dening access to a party congress last month, he said.

   Nearly 33 million retirees will have to pay
premiums for several more months for Medicare catastrophic coverage
_ a program that will be abolished on Dec. 31.
   Gwendolyn King, commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, blamed Congress' late action in repealing the law.
She said Monday there is no way that Social Security computers can
be adjusted more quickly to halt withholding of the premiums from
monthly benefit checks.
   The premiums will be refunded in a lump sum later, Ms. King said.
   ``We have people going flat out ... but we won't be able to make
all the changes until perhaps the end of April or the beginning of
May,'' Ms. King said.
   That means the great majority of retirees _ perhaps up to 29
million _ will have to pay $5.30 a month for three or four months
for a program that will no longer exist. Some retirees pay less;
others pay more.
   ``The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this
egg, but we did not lay it,'' Ms. King said.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Aging
Committee, said in a letter to Ms. King that ``a lengthy delay (in
halting collection of the premiums) will create a firestorm of
protest. We must recognize the impending firestorm and move rapidly
to alleviate the problem.''
   Pryor predicted that if the Social Security Administration
continues withholding the premiums until early summer, it could
take the rest of the year for retirees to get their money back.
   Pryor estimated that would temporarily take $1 billion out of
the pockets of the elderly. In many cases, he said, they need that
money to pay private ``Medigap'' insurance policy premium increases
expected to result from repeal of federal catastrophic coverage.
   ``We knew there might be a problem but I don't think we expected
it to take this long to resolve,'' said John Rother of the American
Association of Retired Persons. ``Congress normally gives the
Social Security Administraton about a three-month lead time for
changes.''
   Since Jan. 1, most people 65 and older have been paying $4 a
month to finance part of the cost of Medicare catastrophic
coverage. The year-old program aims to prevent a retiree from being
by bankrupted by a major illness. The monthly premium is scheduled
to rise to $5.30 on Jan. 1.
   Premiums paid this year will not be refunded; they finance
extended hospital coverage and other, minor catastrophic benefits
that have been in effect since January.
   Two-thirds of the cost of the program would have been borne by
higher-income retirees through an income surtax of up to $800 a
year.
   Officials have no way of knowing whether those people have been
making periodic payments of the surtax along with their quarterly
estimated payments of income tax. Those who have, and those past 65
who are earning wages and may have paid the surtax through the
withholding system, will be able to subtract the surtax from taxes
due with they file their returns early next year.
   Congress repealed catastrophic because of protests from those
higher-income retirees and from others who have a private
catastrophic plan or coverage geared to their retirement benefits.
   The repeal vote came Nov. 22. Although Congress has adjourned
until Jan. 23, the bill has not yet been delivered to President
Bush for his signature. That could come this week.
   Ms. King, Pryor and Rother said they regret that some people
with the lowest income will be hurt by the delay in halting
collection of the premiums.
   ``My concern is for those on fixed income who cannot afford to
see $5 go out of their checks,'' Ms. King said. ``That's a lot of
money for those people and it is little consolation for them to
know they will get a refund in the future.''

   Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, was holding
an afternoon news conference to announce his resignation, but
copies of his statement were circulated in advance on Capitol Hill.
   In his letter of resignation to President Bush, Wall complained
about a ``steady stream of one-sided information emanating from the
House Banking Committee hearings concerning my handling of Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan.''
   Wall has been criticized in Congress and elsewhere for not
moving more swiftly to seize control of Lincoln, which is expected
to become the biggest S&amp;L failure in history.

<HEAD>Exchange Student and American Girlfriend Still Fighting Separation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Love has found new champions in the
battle to allow a Finnish exchange student to return to high school
here after being banished to Maine because he was spending too much
time with his American girlfriend.
   Iiro Lehtinen, 18, said he was given two hours to pack his bags
Nov. 11 before being transferred to South Portland, Maine, because
exchange program leaders said his friendship with Kelly LaPointe
was causing his grades to suffer.
   Lehtinen, in Farmington briefly Sunday, spent about an hour at
LaPointe's home with her and her family, met with a state
legislator who has taken an interest in the case and was
interviewed for two national television programs.
   His transfer prompted a walk-out last week of about 100
students, a third of Farmington's student body.
   Officials of the Education Foundation for Foreign Study, which
sponsors the exchange program, say Lehtinen was transferred because
he was spending too much time with LaPointe and not enough time
with his host family.
   The group's regional director, Meg Holliday, has denied anyone
from her organization told the youths they had to break up, but
Lehtinen said he was told by an official after he got to South
Portland that he had two weeks to break up with LaPointe.
   He said the order since has been replaced with directives
limiting him to one visit and two telephone conversations with
LaPointe a month.
   State Rep. William Tsiros said the move was an insult to
Farmington's hospitality and a violation of the boy's civil rights.
   The foundation and the host family ``are missing the point that
it is normal for an 18-year-old boy to have a romantic relationship
with a girl,'' Tsiros said.
   LaPointe, 17, said the foundation officials make it sound like
she sat around all day in front of the television waiting for
Lehtinen to come over.
   ``I'm on the honor roll, I'm a Big Sister and I play sports
year-round,'' she said. ``Whenever Iiro and I were together we were
out with other people at high school games and functions.''
   Tsiros said he has called state officials in Concord, federal
officials in Washington and the foundation headquarters in
Massachusetts to try to bring Lehtinen back.
   And the boy's father has been lobbying from Finland to reverse
the decision.
   The host family won't talk about the dispute.

<HEAD>World War II Horror Revived in Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Europe is shedding the legacy of World War
II, a British libel trial has in a way resurrected it.
   The case that Britons were reading about in their Sunday
newspapers, even as President Bush and President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev were meeting to shape the post-postwar era, revived a
little-known horror in May 1945, when the British army repatriated
70,000 Cossack and Yugoslav refugees to a grisly fate at the hands
of their communist enemies.
   The trial ended last week in a record $2.6 million award, and
showed the abiding power of World War II to disrupt lives and pose
painful questions a generation later.
   The victorious plaintiff in the High Court in London was Lord
Aldington, former Conservative Party deputy chairman, business
leader and college head. In 1945 he was Brig. Toby Low, the officer
based in Allied-occupied Austria who was ordered to implement the
deportation.
   The most prominent defendant was Count Nikolai Tolstoy, a
historian who had written a pamphlet accusing Aldington of
responsibility for sending the Cossacks and Yugoslavs, men, women
and children, to the firing squads or labor camps.
   Aldington, 74, endured 30 hours of cross-examination. At one
stage he stopped answering questions and wept.
   Tolstoy and co-defendant Nigel Watts, a realtor who distributed
the pamphlet, were ordered to pay the damages plus an almost equal
sum in legal costs.
   Tolstoy said the verdict had left him financially ruined.
   For some, the case had modern-day resonances in Britain's
imminent plans to repatriate 40,000 Vietnamese boat people encamped
in Hong Kong.
   Columnist Simon Jenkins, 46, wrote in The Sunday Times that his
generation should be wary of using hindsight to judge officers
acting 44 years ago in the chaotic aftermath of a five-year war.
   But he wondered whether after the boat people were dealt with,
``after hundreds more deaths, will there be remorseful memoirs,
bitter accusations _ and yet more libel trials?''
   The Russian Cossacks and Yugoslavs who had fled the Soviet army
to safety behind British lines were anti-Communist, anti-Soviet,
and in many cases had fought for the Germans.
   Britain had agreed secretly with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to
return all Soviet and Yugoslav prisoners. It had no illusions the
evacuees faced a rough time after repatriation, but felt bound by
the agreement in order to ensure the repatriation of its own
prisoners in Soviet hands.
   The story that unfolded over nine weeks in the packed court was
filled with anguish. It told of British authorities resorting to
subterfuge, telling the prisoners they were being sent to safety in
Italy; of prisoners killing themselves while still in British
hands; of British soldiers allowing prisoners to escape rather than
have them on their conscience; of other soldiers rifle-butting them
into the trains, despising them for having been pro-German.
   Nigel Nicolson, a young officer at the time, remembered seeing
men herded into cattle trucks and sent screaming to certain
execution.
   ``We considered it one of the most disgraceful operations any
British troops anywhere had been ordered to undertake,'' Nicolson,
now 72, testified.
   Aldington said he had only obeyed orders and had no reason to
believe executions would follow.
   ``There were many officers who were very unhappy about what we
had to do and I was amongst them, but I didn't make a fuss about
it. I just got on with my job,'' he testified.
   Aldington told his cross-examiner: ``You say I knew they were
going to be massacred. That is not what I was told. I was told that
war criminals would be tried and others would be put to work.
   ``It is terrible what happened, I know. Nobody's denying that
what happened was ghastly. I don't understand why you want to harry
me over and over again.''
   Tolstoy, the British-born grandson of a Russian Cossack, has
written several books aimed at exposing what he calls an
``inexcusable cover-up in British public life.''
   Robert Knight, a teacher of European studies who testified for
Aldington, wrote in the Guardian that Tolstoy had ``sunk into the
swamp of his own conspiracy theory.''
   In summing up, the judge said some might think the verdict would
settle the debate for good. ``It would be very nice to think it
would,'' he said. ``But it seems to me unlikely that will happen.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush today hailed the
``peaceful revolution'' sweeping Communist Eastern Europe, but
pledged the United States would keep ``significant military
forces'' on the continent as long as allied leaders want them there.
   Bush, who spent the weekend in summit talks with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, emerged from a meeting with NATO leaders to praise the
Soviet leader's handling of the changes throughout the Eastern
Bloc. He it ``absolutely mandates new thinking'' on the part of
Western leaders.
   At the same time, Bush wouldn't go along with Gorbachev's
post-summit declaration on Sunday that the world was leaving the
``epoch of the Cold War.''
   Said Bush: ``If I signal to you there's no Cold War then they'll
say, `Well, what are you doing with troops in Europe?'''
   Bush's meeting with NATO leaders was private. But Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek told reporters the president said the
superpower leaders agreed in Malta to aim for an East-West summit
in Vienna next summer to sign a landmark treaty reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``Let's get it done,'' the president said at his news
conference. He said he wanted the accord ``in the bank'' before
moving on to more complicated matters.
   Bush and the allied leaders met as Gorbachev was convening a
meeting of a radically reordered Warsaw Pact in Moscow.
   The president was in good humor as he neared the end of his
summit journey. He laughed off a reporter's suggestion that he had
been at risk during bad weather in Malta when he boarded a small
boat for a brief trip through rough seas to return to a warship
anchored offshore.
   ``These charismatic, visionary, macho guys, they'll do
anything,'' he said to laughter.
   Bush was flying home shortly after his news conference.
   The 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations are negotiating in
Vienna on cuts in conventional forces in Europe. Van den Broek
quoted Bush as saying he hoped an accord could be reached about
mid-1990.
   Conventional forces aside, the superpowers are negotiating a
treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent, and a
separate agreement on banning chemical weapons.
   On the subject of trade, Bush signaled his intention anew to
help the battered Soviet economy. But when asked whether Gorbachev
would be invited to next year's economic summit of industrial
democracies, he replied, ``two chances _ slim and none _ for that
particular meeting. Nor did he request to be included in that
particular meeting,'' he said.
   Bush said that while ``all was not sweetness and light'' at the
Malta summit, even as he applauded Gorbachev's handling of the
change in Eastern Europe.
   Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said ``I think he took
my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable
about our common objectives.''
   He said Gorbachev was ``determined and unemotional '' in their
private talks. The Soviet leader ``seemed very much in control''
and ``very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of
subjects with me.''
   The conventional arms talks are designed to reduce U.S. troops
in Europe by 30,000 and Soviet troops by 325,000 to a level of
about 275,000 on each side. The negotiations also are attempting to
control tanks and other weapons.
   ``The importance of this is that it indicates both (Bush and
Gorbachev) want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next
year,'' Van den Broek said.
   ``In that context, the term mid-1990 was mentioned. Without a
doubt, that should be regarded as positive,'' he said.
   Bush was asked whether the improvement in East-West relations
could free money for domestic programs such as education and the
homeless. ``I think it is premature to speak as some are at home
about a peace dividend,'' he said.
   Bush noted large federal deficits and said there isn't ``excess
money'' available.
   The president began his news conference with a statement that
said a ``peaceful revolution'' was taking place in Eastern Europe,
where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks _
and some coutries have experienced more than one change in
government.
   He said his goal was to see ``individual freedom everywhere
replace coercion and tyranny.''
   He said the task for Western nations is to consolidate the
fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture or
the continued peaceful changes and end the division of Europe and
Germany and create a ``Europe whole and free.''
   At the same time, he said the Western alliance ``must remain
strong,'' and said the United States ``will maintain significant
military forces in Europe as long as our allies desire our
presence.''
   Even as Bush was preparing to leave for home, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III was making arrangements for a trip to West
Berlin next week. His trip will take him to the most notable symbol
of the Cold War _ the Berlin Wall _ which has effectively crumbled.
   A British official said Bush's summit briefing for allied
leaders was ``extremely well-received'' and that today's session
showed ``very strong support for the NATO alliance.''
   Baker said Bush outlined his agreements and differences with
Gorbachev. ``Most everyone there was very pleased,'' Baker said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
the NATO allies were particularly interested in the issue of German
reunification, which Gorbachev opposes.
   ``The president is certainly not going to stand in the way of
reunification, but it needs to proceed at its own pace,'' Scowcroft
said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   According to a knowledgeable Belgian source, who spoke only on
condition he not be identified, Bush criticized Gorbachev's denial
that the Soviets were supplying arms to leftist rebels in El
Salvador as ``out of step with the new thinking'' in Moscow.
   The arrival of Bush's 10-car motorcade at NATO headquarters for
the second meeting of allied leaders this year was heralded by a
noisy helicopter, providing security and surveillance for the
entourage. NATO staff members applauded Bush as he briskly strode
into the building.
   In opening remarks, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said
the NATO leaders' second meeting since May ``reflects the
accelerated pace of political change across Europe.'' He said ``the
question of the architecture of the future Europe has arrived
before us, more quickly than anyone could have predicted.''
   The president, who flew here Sunday night immediately after the
summit, had said the meeting helped dispel Gorbachev's doubts about
Bush's attitude toward economic and political reforms in the Soviet
Union, as the United States applauds the fall of hard-line
communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe.
   ``I don't think he has me down as a total negativist at all and
I certainly don't have him down'' that way, Bush said before
leaving the Mediterranean island of Malta, where he held eight
hours of discussions with Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise liner
Maxim Gorky.

   An independent record promoter pleaded
innocent today to charges that he provided cash and cocaine to get
songs played on several radio stations.
   Joseph Isgro, who appeared before U.S. Magistrate Volney V.
Brown Jr., pleaded innocent to 51 counts of making illegal payoffs,
distributing cocaine, racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of
justice, tax fraud and mail fraud.
   A Jan. 23 trial was scheduled before U.S. District Judge James
M. Ideman.
   A second defendant, Jeffrey Monka, pleaded innocent to
money-laundering charges today. Prosecutors say Monka set up a sham
company to help Isgro launder the cash used for ``payola'' to
employees of several radio stations.
   Payoffs allegedly were made at stations in Los Angeles, Fresno
and El Paso, Texas.
   Former Columbia Records executive Raymond Anderson was to be
arraigned next week. Prosecutors say Anderson took kickbacks from
Isgro.
   Isgro is free on $300,000 bail and Anderson is free on $50,000
bail. Bail was set at $100,000 for Monka, whose attorney, William
Pitman, said his client has remained in jail because of a clerical
error.

   A defiant liberty bell stands on a
hill above Prague, but many now notice revolutionaries failed to
add a clapper to their makeshift symbol. They're still building the
revolution.
   ``The Communists are playing for time, and we can't rest a
minute,'' said Lenka Ressova, a young technician, before joining
more than 150,000 people Monday on Wenceslas Square.
   The crowd, chanting, ``Resign! Resign!'' delivered its verdict
on a new Communist-dominated Cabinet meant to shape a new
Czechoslovakia. In thundering unison, people added, ``Free
elections!''
   But at opposition headquarters, Civic Forum leaders wrestled
with a problem now familiar as the Iron Curtain tatters: Where to
find popular, experienced leaders in societies ruled 40 years by a
single ideology.
   ``They're fighting over every line,'' reported a Civic Forum
member, emerging from strategy talks over how to protest a new
government of Communist Party holdovers and only five little-known
outsiders. ``This will not be easy.''
   He asked anonymity, no longer afraid of secret police but wanted
to stay clear of internal politics.
   The overall mood is confident, even ebullient, as Czechoslovaks
try out new freedoms few dreamed were possible only weeks ago. But
cold, hard realism has replaced the first warm rush.
   A clear strain of anxiety that marked faces at Monday's mass
rally was reflected all over town. Politics penetrated every
crevice of Prague.
   ``No one talks of anything else,'' said Hana Lingerova, slinging
plates of roast pork at the Old Synagogue cafe. She amused
customers by making folds in a banknote to turn a pictured
Communist hero into the movie alien from ``E.T. _ The
Extra-Terrestrial.''
   In downtown metro stops, huge crowds mobbed public TV sets. In
the outskirts, people rose at 3:30 a.m. to get the morning papers
before they sold out.
   At the Charles University Faculty of Medicine and Physics,
frazzled students watched TV, nibbled at stale sandwiches and
churned out leaflets on their prehistoric computers.
   Milan Horak, 21, studied a visiting reporter's passport with
more care than the immigration officer at Prague Airport.
   ``Infiltrators are trying to sneak in, to divide us and change
our minds,'' he said. A revolutionary guard was comprised of four
sleepy students armed with a guitar.
   Horak acknowledged that although people demand that the
Communists hand over power, no alternate leaders were emerging.
``Our leaders are compromised, and the people who could lead were
driven off,'' he said.
   Asked about Alexander Dubcek, Horak gave the awkward shrug which
often greets that name. Dubcek, a powerful symbol, led
Czechoslovakia to the ``Prague Spring'' that was crushed by Warsaw
Pact tanks 21 years ago. But for most young people, he has been a
Communist for too long.
   Vaclav Havel, the playwright whose life-long insistence on human
freedoms shaped the script for the revolution, rejects any
prolonged role in the politics of what comes next.
   In the vacuum of power, untested names rise in moments of glory.
There are insistent calls for Valtr Komarek, a reform-minded
economist, but critics say he is blemished by his close ties to the
failing system.
   ``Now comes the hard part, the pressure of the mind,'' said
Jaroslav Nesetril, a professor who dropped in to check on the
students. ``The Communists are more experienced, more organized. It
is in nature that everything is reversible.''
   In the bowels of the ABC Theater, people who helped bring off
the revolution harbor few illusions about the next act. They admire
Havel and the intellectuals around him, but most agree it is time
for others to move in.
   ``That is the question, where to find the leaders,'' said Ivo
Niederle, a popular actor. ``We must find them.''
   Havel has offered to play some sort of transitional role, but
has made it plain he is not eager to be the missing clapper in
Czechoslovakia's liberty bell.
   Late Saturday night, he emerged from a dinner, haggard.
   ``Are you going into politics?'' he was asked.
   ``I'm going to bed,'' he replied.

   President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev are finding it easier to endorse political change
in Europe than to deal with the consequences.
   After a summit meeting in which both leaders envisioned an end
to East-West rivalry, they face the considerably more difficult
task of redefining their respective military alliances without
upsetting a balance of power established through 40 years of Cold
War.
   For Gorbachev, the assignment is especially tricky. He seeks to
preserve his Warsaw Pact alliance at the same time that its
hard-line communist regimes are being swept aside. During the
post-summit news conference, a Czechoslovakian journalist pointedly
asked whether he had renounced the Brezhnev doctrine used to
justify the 1968 Soviet invasion of that country as it began to tip
Westward.
   ``Every nation is an independent entity in world politics and
every people has the right to choose its own destiny, the destiny
of its own state,'' the Soviet leader replied.
   Gorbachev's response underscored the diminishing role _ and
perhaps ability _ of the Kremlin to control the political avalanche
in Eastern Europe.
   ``No one can avoid this evolutionary process,'' he said.
   Bush, following Gorbachev in response to the Czechoslovakian
question, praised the Soviet leader for the reforms he has started
in the Soviet Union and its allies.
   However, the president is not as eager to claim, as the Soviet
leader had at the joint news conference, that the ``epoch of the
cold war'' is over.
   On Monday, after he briefed NATO allies in Brussels, Bush said:
``Is the Cold War raging like it was before, in the times of the
Berlin blockade? Absolutely not. But if I signal to you there's no
Cold War, then they'll say, `Well, what are you doing with troops
in Europe?'''
   Both leaders say they want to preserve the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Warsaw Pact to maintain stability, but want to
conclude an agreement by late 1990 to cut troops in Central Europe,
withdrawing 30,000 U.S. and 325,000 Soviet soldiers.
   The memory of Nazi Germany, which invaded many NATO and Warsaw
Pact members during World War II, still looms large in the European
equation.
   Gorbachev has expressed concern about a proposal last week by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for a confederation of East and
West Germany. Soviet officials say West Germany has never renounced
its claims to the pre-war German borders, which included parts of
Poland.
   Bush sought to assuage those Soviet fears by reaffirming U.S.
support for the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which were signed by the
United States, Soviet Union and 33 other nations and ``spells out a
concept of permanent borders.''
   The Helsinki accords, said Gorbachev, ``summed up the results of
the Second World War and consolidated the results of the war. ...
And the reality is such that we have today's Europe with two German
states.''
   Bush reiterated the U.S. position that any move toward the
reunification of Germany will have to be gradual and respect the
rights of people on both sides of the present border to
self-determination.
   At the same time, Bush made it clear that the United States will
keep its troops in Europe as long as NATO allies want them there.
   ``The United States will remain a European power, and that means
that the United States will stay engaged in the future of Europe
and in our common defense,'' Bush said.
   To cope with Soviet concerns about Germany unified outside the
postwar alliance strucure and to keep pace with the changes in
Eastern Europe, Gorbachev has accepted Polish proposals to
restructure the Warsaw Pact. NATO should do the same, he said.
   ``They should not remain military alliances, but rather
military-political alliances and later on, just political
alliances, so that their nature would change in accordance with the
changes on the continent,'' he said.

   A U.S.-Soviet dispute over naval
disarmament, unrelieved by the weekend seaside summit, will likely
keep the Mediterranean the world's most heavily armed waters for
years to come.
   Along with Central America, the rivalry of the two superpower
navies, especially in the Mediterranean, surfaced as the most
publicly divisive issue to confront President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their storm-buffetted sessions.
   Bush ruled out any immediate progress.
   ``The chairman raised the question of naval arms control and I
was not particularly positive in responding,'' Bush told a
concluding joint news conference with Gorbachev. ``We still have
differences with the Soviet Union. He knows it and I know it.''
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney put it even more bluntly.
``Naval forces are absolutely crucial to the United States,'' he
said in a Sunday interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``We are a major maritime power. Our ability to reinforce our
allies in Europe is tied to our naval forces and we're not
interested in limitations on those forces,'' Cheney said.
   A setting for fierce battles since the birth of Western
civilization, the Mediterranean since World War II has seen many
engagements and confrontations among the 17 bordering nations and
outside powers like the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. 6th Fleet, whose flagship the USS Belknap was Bush's
home for the summit, keeps 30 ships, 100 aircraft and 20,000 troops
at sea, operating under NATO direction in case of conflict.
   Most of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid _ Egypt,
Israel, Turkey and Greece _ border the Mediterranean. The United
States keeps bases in four Mediterranean countries.
   The United States has flown over the Mediterranean to bomb
Libya, shipped Marines through it to Lebanon, and intercepted
airliners and ships carrying terrorists above and through its
waters.
   The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has been steadily
decreasing its Mediterranean fleet to 30 or 40 vessels since 1985.
Still, it regularly steams through the Turkish Straits with its two
guided-missile cruisers with nuclear capabilities.
   One of them, the Slava, was anchored in Marsaxlokk Bay here for
the summit. Storm conditions prevented it from hosting Saturday's
summit talk between the two leaders, as originally planned.
   In the Black Sea, the Soviets are building the first helicopter
carrier of its class, the Tblisi. It is expected to sail through
the straits into the sea sometime in 1990.
   Those straits accommodate the flow of more than 50 percent of
the Soviet Union's sea-carried Soviet exports and imports,
according to U.S. estimates.
   And Soviet Navy ships have been docking more regularly at
Tartus, Syria and even in Libya recently _ heightening U.S. concern.
   Before arriving in Malta, Gorbachev used a state dinner in Italy
to revive his year-old proposal for a nuclear-free Mediterranean.
   His plan would establish a ceiling for naval forces of both
nations and their eventual withdrawal from the Mediterranean. This
would be accompanied by a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans.
   Bush dismissed the proposal again by replying that arms
reductions in the Mediterranean _ and specifically Italy _ could
only take place if a global treaty were reached on conventional
weapons reductions in Europe.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Moscow
was likely to continue substantial financing for its submarine
operations to counter U.S. submarine-launched cruise missiles,
which have a servicing base on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.
   ``The Southern flank is the weakest part of our alliance,'' says
Professor Enrico Jacchia, director or Strategic Studies at Rome's
Free University. ``It is less important from the point of view of
the concentration of Eastern and Western military forces, but it is
certainly more vulnerable.''
   ``The United States and the Soviet Union, whether they like it
or not, have a major role to fill in this area for a long time in
the foreseeable future,'' he added.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing Father in Hospital</HEAD>

   A man accused of killing his
77-year-old father in his hospital bed was in stable condition
Monday recovering from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials
said.
   Leonide L. Michaud Jr., 47, was under police guard at Waterville
Osteopathic Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Bonnie Lantz.
   Michaud was charged with murder after he allegedly shot and
killed his father, Leonide L. Michaud Sr., also of Waterville, at
the Thayer Unit of Mid-Maine Medical Center.
   Spokesman Stephen McCausland of the Maine Public Safety
Department said the younger Michaud went to his father's hospital
room Saturday night, pulled out a handgun and held two nurses, an
unarmed security guard and another patient at gunpoint before
several shots were fired.
   The elder Michaud was dead and his son suffered two ``minor''
self-inflicted wounds to the head, McCausland said. The others were
not hurt, police said.
   Michaud Jr. was given emergency medical treatment and then taken
to the Waterville police station, where he was charged with murder,
McCausland said. While in a holding cell, Michaud complained of
chest pains and was rushed to Waterville Osteopathic Hospital.
   McCausland would not comment on a motive.
   McCausland said the Michaud family had been told by doctors that
his illnesses were probably terminal. Michaud suffered ``a variety
of ailents associated with old age,'' McCausland added.

<HEAD>King Appoints Islamic Sympathizer Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Zeid Bin Shaker resigned
Monday and was replaced by Mudar Badran, who has held the office
twice before and is sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists.
   King Hussein told Badran to concentrate on improving Jordan's
dismal economy situation and to support the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Bin Shaker's resignation had been expected following
parliamentary elections last month, the first nationwide balloting
in 22 years. He took office in April after the resignation of Zaid
Rifai and formed a transitional government for the purpose of
preparing for the elections.
   The king assigned the outgoing Cabinet to continue its duties
until Badran forms a new one.
   ``I ask you to work with the PLO and to support the
steadfastness of our brothers, the Palestinians in their occupied
territories,'' Hussein said in a letter to Badran, the former chief
of the royal court.
   The monarch stressed the importance of increasing the kingdom's
foreign currency reserves and maintaining the Jordanian dinar's
purchasing power.
   Since late last year, the dinar's value against other currencies
has fallen sharply under the pressure of foreign debts of more than
$8.3 billion.
   Riots triggered by price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent
for food and fuel led to riots that killed nine people in April and
led to Rifai's resignation.
   Royal palace officials said naming of a new Cabinet might be
delayed because of disputes among potential new ministers over the
assignment of portfolios.
   The palace officials said the new Cabinet would include some
former ministers, some members of the royally appointed senate and
some deputies elected Nov. 8.
   According to one royal palace source, the disputes stem from
three Moslem Brotherhood deputies who were assigned portfolios
``which they did not accept.''
   The source did not explain what chairs they were assigned but he
said they were seeking the portfolios of education, higher
education and Islamic religious affairs.
   The Moslem Brotherhood, which won 25 seats in Parliament,
campaigned to impose stricter Islamic laws and improve social
welfare benefits. There are nearly three dozen deputies in the
80-seat Parliament with Islamic leanings.
   Badran is known to sympathize with extremist Moslem factions,
including the Moslem Brotherhood.
   The November elections were the first nationwide poll since 1967
when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan. Hussein last year
renounced Jordan's claim to the West Bank in favor of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Badran, who graduated from the University of Damscus in 1957
with a law degree, served as prime minister as well as defense and
foreign affairs minister in 1976-79 and 1980-84.
   During both of Badran's terms, Jordanian relations with Syria
deteriorated, first because Syrian alleged Jordan was supporting
Moslem Brotherhood activists seeking to topple Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
   The countries reconciled in 1979 after Arabs joined together to
oppose the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
   A year later, relations were severed again when Syria sided with
Iran in its war against Iraq. Jordan was Iraq's main backer.
   When Hussein patched up his relations with Assad in 1985, he
apologized for Jordanian backing of the Brotherhood and claimed it
had been carried out without his knowledge by previous governments,
including Badran's.
   Jordan's relations with its powerful northern neighbor are
lukewarm, mainly because it opposes Syrian's military presence in
Lebanon.
   As royal court chief, Badran was responsible for palace
operations and served as a key political adviser to Hussein. The
post has often been a stepping stone to the prime minister's office.

   The defense rested Monday in the manslaughter trial
of a Miami policeman after rolling a motorcycle into the courtroom
to show jurors how the vehicle looked the day the defendant shot
and killed its driver.
   The case could go to final arguments Tuesday.
   William Lozano, 31, a suspended officer, faces two manslaughter
counts in the January deaths of the bike's driver, Clement Lloyd,
23, and passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, both black. Lozano is
Colombian born. The shooting triggered three days of racial
violence in Miami.
   The prosecution claims Lozano shot and killed Lloyd
unnecessarily as the Kawasaki Ninja superbike, fleeing from a
pursuing squad car, sped past the officer in the opposite lane.
   But the defense says the motorcycle was bearing down on Lozano,
who shot in self-defense. On Monday they rolled a 1988 Ninja
similar to Lloyd's into the courtroom over the prosecutors'
protests that the bike would look too large in an enclosed area.
   Defense Attorney Mark Seiden had an expert testify about the
cycle's measurements to show the bullet could have entered Lloyd's
head at a slight angle _ as the autopsy showed _ even if the bike
was headed directly at the officer.

   A $16 million personal backruptcy plan for
former Ohio financier Marvin L. Warner won court approval today
after two years of wrangling, but the government may appeal.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor said the Internal Revenue
Service would get about $13 million it is owed in yearly
installments. The government argued that the Warner assets could be
dissipated before the IRS gets paid.
   Proctor cleared way for Warner's many creditors to begin
collecting under Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules whether or not there
is a government appeal.
   The judge harshly criticized Warner, 70, a former U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland whose fortune crumbled after a bank he
owned collapsed.
   The judge noted that Warner had come before the court in a
Jacksonville hearing Sunday and criticized his creditors, his
lawyers and the courts.
   ``He places the blame on many parties,'' Proctor said. ``But I
never once heard Mr. Warner place the blame where it belongs, and
that's squarely on his own shoulders.''
   However, the judge said he believed it was ``important for
Warner to have this plan approved.'' He said it would get him out
of the courts and ``restore some of his dignity.''
   ``I wish him no ill will,'' the judge added.
   Warner lawyer Scott Alan Orth said, ``The issues in this case
weighed heavily on the judge's mind, and he did what he could. ...
I think Mr. Warner did take responsibility in this case. He made
mistakes, but they were mistakes in litigation not in life.''
   Warner promised Sunday to deposit $6 million with the creditors'
committee to complete the plan, then he said he would look for ``a
little air and sunshine.''
   Proctor on Sunday also approved $3.6 million in fees to
attorneys and accountants including Price-Waterhouse, which spent
thousands of hours analyzing Warner's financial transactions since
his Home State Savings Bank in Cincinnati collapsed in 1985.
   The Home State failure caused a crisis for 69 other Ohio savings
and loans whose deposits were insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee
Fund.
   Warner filed for protection from creditors in October 1987 under
federal bankruptcy law to halt $4 billion in claims against him.
   The judge said today's hearing was needed to conclude arguments
for the plan.
   ``We're anxious to rid ourselves of litigation,'' Warner said,
referring to the bank collapse that precipitated his bankruptcy
filing. ``My wife and I have fought this thing for five years. We
believe there is a little air and sunshine somewhere on this planet
for us.''
   Warner, 70, who lives in Ocala, criticized the treatment he has
received in court and the advice he has received from lawyers. But
the judge defended his actions.
   ``I'm satisfied that he has received fair treatment before this
court. I make no apologies to Mr. Warner or anyone else in this
case,'' Proctor said.
   Warner had offered in November to pay creditors $17.5 million on
the condition he be allowed to pursue lawsuits against the
accounting firms Grant Thornton and Arthur Anderson &amp; Co., which
had audited Home State before the collapse.
   He agreed to drop the proposed change and have the case
converted from Chapter 11 status to a Chapter 7 liquidation after
creditors refused to allow the case to be tied up in further
lawsuits.
   A jury in Ohio found Warner guilty in March 1987 on charges
resulting from Home State's collapse. Warner was sentenced to 3{
years in prison, but a state appellate court recently rejected the
convictions. Ohio prosecutors plan to ask the state Supreme Court
to reinstate the convictions.
   Ohio has spent $5.6 million prosecuting the case against Warner
and has made provisions to recover about $135 million as
reimbursement for protecting Home State's depositors. The thrift
had about $1.4 billion in assets and served about 92,000
depositors. It was sold and reopened in June 1985.

<HEAD>Bush Support on German Question May Open New Divide Among Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday endorsed a
cautious and measured approach to reunifying Germany, instilling
gratitude in West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl but wariness among
some other NATO allies.
   Bush indicated at a special session of Western alliance leaders
that a single German state still loyal to NATO would express the
yearning of Germans for unity as well as the right to a nation's
self-determination.
   ``We are not trying to accelerate the process,'' Bush later told
a news conference wrapping up his talks with allied leaders here.
``It's better to let things move on their own.''
   But his concept of a reunified Germany within a future Europe
bound by common goals and values gave new life to an issue that
stirs concern on both sides of the East-West divide.
   ``Self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to its
outcome,'' Bush told reporters in recapping his views on
reunification.
   He said West Germany must remain committed to NATO and the
European Community, ``with due regard for the legal role and
responsibilities of the Allied powers,'' and said reunification
would have to be ``peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step
basis.''
   He said he thought Kohl ``feels comfortable'' with the U.S.
terms on rejoining the two Germanys, and stressed that no time
frame has been identified for reunification.
   Kohl expressed thanks for Bush's ``support on those questions of
concern to us Germans.''
   The ``German Question'' dominated and intensified the alliance
gathering called to discuss the weekend summit in Malta with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which also dwelled heavily on the
democratic reform wave eroding Europe's political divide.
   The changes reshaping Eastern Europe most directly affect the
Germans, who have been separated since World War II into the rival
camps of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Kohl spelled out his own 10-point plan for reunification before
the special NATO gathering, and complained that some allies have
rejected it without study.
   ``People outside Germany are speaking of these plans without
even having read them,'' the chancellor said, declining to name the
NATO leaders who oppose the quest for reunification.
   ``We are most grateful to the (U.S.) president for having shown
understanding and offered support for our position as Germans,''
Kohl said. ``He also did so at Malta.''
   In contrast, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appeared
at her post-summit briefing to be clearly perturbed by elements of
Bush's address, though she did not specify the subject of German
reunification.
   ``We must continue NATO with present borders, because to do
anything else would be to jeopardize the security that we seek,'' a
British source who did not want to be named, quoted Mrs. Thatcher
as telling the allies.
   Kohl suggested that jealous over German economic might could be
at the root of the opposition.
   ``West Germany, with its economic power, is already too strong
for the liking of many,'' the chancellor said pointedly.
   The combined German nations would have a population of nearly 80
million with which to fuel the economic locomotive that has already
made West Germany the biggest exporting nation in the world and the
wealthiest per capita, according to some measures.
   ``If we had this same discussion in 1982, when our economic
situation was completely different than that which exists in West
Germany today, the discussion would not have been so difficult,''
Kohl said, making clear there was a debate over the unity plan.
   Kohl sought to allay fears that a reunified Germany would pose
any threat to either the NATO alliance or the stability of Europe.
   He attempted to draw a distinction between the concept of
``inviolable borders'' and ``untouchable borders.''
   The 1976 Helsinki Act ensures the inviolability of present-day
European borders, which opponents of reunification contend rules
out the recarving of a single Germany from the two currently
existing.
   Kohl argued that border revisions of mutual consent between two
states are a matter of ``self-determination,'' another of the
rights recognized among the NATO allies and countries signing the
Helsinki accords.
   Kohl reiterated Bonn's promise that it seeks reunification in a
step-by-step manner consistent with the European process that seeks
disarmament and erasure of military and political divisions.
   ``Gorbachev's call for a common European home is that which we
also speak of in the process of reunification,'' Kohl said.
''Everything we do in Germany is embedded in the development of
Europe overall.''
   Bush said the emergence of a single German state would pose no
problem as long as West Germany stands by its commitments to the
NATO alliance and the European Community.
   And Kohl vowed that those principles are part of the bedrock of
West German policy.
   ``Solution of the German question is only possible under a
European roof,'' the chancellor said.
   Attempting to convince some wary allies that West Germany is
devoted to assisting the whole of Eastern Europe in its drive for
democracy, the chancellor noted that his government has established
a billion-dollar relief fund for Poland and that his visit to
Hungary next week will provide aid for that reformist nation as
well.
   But he conceded that ``understandably, the developments in East
Germany have distracted attention from developments in Poland and
Hungary'' among West Germans.

<HEAD>Bush Praises Gorbachev; Urges `New Thinking' Toward Soviets</HEAD>

   President Bush said Monday it's too
early to proclaim an end to the Cold War, but added that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's acceptance of sweeping reform in Eastern Europe
``absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West.
   Wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at NATO
Headquarters, Bush also told reporters the United States would
maintain ``significant military forces in Europe as long as our
allies desire our presence.''
   The president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in
superpowers conventional forces in Europe ``in the bank'' before
seeking deeper reductions. He told NATO leaders he hoped a
multinational summit could be convened in Europe next summer to
sign such an accord.
   Conventional forces aside, the United States and Soviet Union
are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear
weapons, as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons.
   Bush was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey
that took him to last weekend's summit with Gorbachev.
   Asked if it hadn't been risky to venture out in a small boat in
the storm-tossed harbor in Malta during the weekend, he replied,
``Hot dogging?... No. You know these charismatic, macho, visionary
guys. They'll do anything.''
   The president Bush spoke as Gorbachev was convening a meeting of
a radically reordered Warsaw Pact in Moscow to review the weekend
summit.
   The superpower leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news
conference before leaving Malta that their meeting heralded a new
era of cooperation in East-West relations, including arms control
and trade. They intend to meet again in the United States in the
second half of June.
   At his news conference, Bush said, ``We stand at the threshold
of a new era...'' but declined to assert the Cold War has ended as
Gorbachev suggested.
   ``That day hasn't arrived,'' the president said when asked about
Gorbachev's statement declaring an end to the ``epoch of the Cold
War.''
   Barring a utopian development, Bush said, ``the United States
must stay involved'' by keeping troops massed against Warsaw Pact
forces.
   ``If you want to project out 100 years, or take some years off
of that, you can look to a utopian day when there might be none
(U.S. troops in Europe),'' he said. ``But as I pointed out to them
(NATO leaders), that day hasn't arrived _ and they agree with me.''
   The president began his news conference with a statement that
said a ``peaceful revolution'' was taking place in Eastern Europe,
where five hard line communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks.
   He said his goal was to see ``individual freedom everywhere
replace coercion and tyranny.''
   Bush, apparently referring to disagreements about Central
America, said ``all was not sweetness and light'' at the Malta
summit, but took pains to applaud Gorbachev's handling of the
change in Eastern Europe.
   ``As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has handled the
changes in Eastern Europe, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely
mandates new thinking,'' he said.
   Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said ``I think he took
my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable
about our common objectives.''
   He said Gorbachev was ``determined and unemotional '' in their
private talks. The Soviet leader ``seemed very much in control''
and ``very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of
subjects with me.''
   Bush said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional
forces than are being considered in the Vienna talks. But he said
they viewed ``the rapidity of change differently than we do.''
   And yet Bush registered a renewed personal determination to
realize completion of the treaty next year between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact that would cut U.S. troops by 30,000 and the Soviets by
325,000, to an equal level of 275,000.
   The two alliances' armories of tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme
to reduce tensions from the Atlantic Ocean across the vast expanse
of Europe to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   ``Let's get it done,'' Bush said. He told reporters, ``I, as
president of the United States, will kick the bureaucracy to get it
done.''
   Negotiators working on the accord in the Austrian capital are
making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved, most
significantly a dispute over the kind of Soviet airplanes to be
scrapped.
   In addition, Bush said he was hopeful the West could take steps
to ease Soviet economic woes. ``We want to try to meet him on some
of the areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions
I had in the economic area,'' he said.
   ``But I also believe that the West must remain strong and
together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way, but
not be imprudent,'' he said.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van der Broek said Bush reported to
the NATO leaders that Gorbachev had accepted the multi-nation
summit proposal for next year.
   ``The importance of this is that it indicates both (Bush and
Gorbachev) want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next
year,'' the Dutch official told reporters.
   Also at the NATO session Bush outlined his policy on German
reunification. It rejected a timetable, even though U.S. Ambassador
Vernon A. Walters on Sunday had predicted a merger of East and West
Germany within five years.
   Bush said he favored a step by step approach that also
maintained West German membership in NATO.
   But Bush, in line with his campaign not to alarm Gorbachev or to
assume an aggressive role in Europe, said: ``I am not trying to
accelerate that process.''
   Even so, officials announced that Bush was sending Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to Germany next week for a symbolic visit
to the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the Cold War that has been opened
to free travel.

   America's NATO allies Monday welcomed
President Bush's determination to keep strong military links to
Western Europe despite the diminishing security threat posed by the
Soviet Union.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, though, appeared to
have qualms about some of the president's remarks, in which Bush
raised the possibility of greater arms cuts in Europe and even
closer ties among the European Community nations.
   She said that Bush's speech to leaders of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ``was so full of meat that we really
should consider it very carefully before we reply to it.''
   Others were not so hesitant.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said he was impressed by the
United States' ``extraordinarily positive attitude'' toward events
in Europe.
   ``It has nothing to do with a `we are pulling out' attitude,''
he told reporters. ``On the contrary, they are again promising a
meaningful presence (in Europe).''
   Belgian officials said it was obvious that the president took
Europe seriously.
   Just last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was at NATO
headquarters trying to dispel fears that the United States would
unilaterally pull its troops out of Europe because of budget
deficit pressures and reduced East-West tensions.
   Bush, too, went out of his way to reassure the allies after
giving them an account of his weekend talks with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Malta.
   ``I pledge today that the United States will maintain
significant military forces in Europe as long as our allies desire
our presence as part of a common security effort,'' Bush told the
allies during a closed-door meeting. His remarks were later
released by the White House.
   ``The U.S. will remain a European power,'' he said. ``That means
the U.S. will stay engaged in the future of Europe, and in our
common defense.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said his reassurance was a key outcome of the
meeting.
   Reports of American plans to slash military spending in coming
years have raised concern about the United States' future ties to
its European allies.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said there was no
question of withdrawing his country's forces from Europe. NATO
provides a security link between the two North American nations and
those in Western Europe.
   The officials stressed NATO's importance during the dizzying
pace of political and economic reforms in some of the countries of
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, the East bloc's military alliance.
   Mulroney said NATO was ``more relevant now than ever.''
   ``It offers both security and stability,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens agreed it has an
essential role to play at a time of change.
   In his speech, Bush put special emphasis on negotiations between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact to slash conventional, or non-nuclear,
arms in Europe. Last May, Bush offered a sweeping plan to reduce
those weapons and set a one-year deadline for negotiating a treaty.
   ``We have made good progress since then,'' he said, ``but too
little and too slowly to take full advantage of the opportunity
before us: the chance to ease the Soviet army out of Eastern Europe
and substantially reduce the risk of surprise attack and
aggression.''
   He warned the other leaders that the arms bargaining ``could be
overrun by events. That could be dangerous and we must avoid it.''
   He said he was ``prepared to look with an open mind at ways in
which we can together achieve even lower levels of conventional and
nuclear forces in Europe as part of a negotiated agreement.''
   The president urged the 12 nations of the European Community
trading bloc to press ahead, maybe even intensify, efforts to
become more closely bound. The nations are trying to dismantle
trade barriers to create a single, European-wide market by the end
of 1992.
   Bush said the community also should play a role ``as a magnet
that draws the forces of reform forward in Eastern Europe.''
   His remarks touched on sensitive topics for Mrs. Thatcher.
   She has urged a more cautious attitude than some of the allies
toward the events unfolding in Eastern Europe.
   She also has been isolated from other Common Market members over
plans for a tight economic and monetary union that would lead to a
common currency and European-wide central bank system. The
community holds a summit later this week in Strasbourg, France, to
thrash out these issues.
   Mrs. Thatcher insisted she did not feel left out of the NATO
talks. ``Time after time, the word caution came (up),'' she said.
   ``Turmoil can be very disturbing,'' she said, ``and we don't
know what may happen.''
   She said the reform paths embarked on by the East European
governments were difficult. ``It's easier to demand freedom than it
is to set a structure of freedom in place,'' she said.
   Lubbers said the Bush administration was ``not at all fearful of
the possibilities of rapprochement in Europe and of the European
healing process.''
   ``They obviously see it as a very positive adventure,'' he said.

   Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday as far south as
Florida, where Tampa registered just 33 degrees, and the cold plus
up to 2 feet of fresh snow closed schools and slowed travel in
parts of the Northeast.
   ``We're looking at an Arctic blast here,'' said Art Lester of
the National Weather Service in Portland, Maine.
   Authorities in Washington, Boston and Philadelphia stepped up
efforts to get homeless people into warm shelter. At least 11
deaths were blamed on the weather during the weekend.
   Pre-dawn temperatures at Albany, N.Y., were in the single
digits, but 25 mph wind made it feel like 30 degrees below zero,
the National Weather Service said.
   ``This is our first real arctic air outbreak of the season,''
said meteorologist Al Moore of the weather service at Newark, N.J.,
where it was 15 degrees Monday.
   But relief was on the way with a warm front sweeping across the
Midwest. At midday, temperatures across Illinois ranged from 32 on
the Chicago lakefront to 51 at Belleville, near St. Louis, Mo. And
in the Pacific Northwest, the problem was melting snow and heavy
rain that threatened floods and caused mudslides, one of which
pushed a van off a busy road east of Seattle.
   Temperatures hit record lows Monday all across Florida,
including 47 at Miami, 39 at Fort Myers, 33 at Tampa, 40 at St.
Petersburg and 27 at Apalachicola.
   Most of Alabama had record lows, including 25 at the Gulf of
Mexico port of Mobile. In Mississippi, Jackson and Meridian each
hit a record low of 20.
   But Florida citrus growers welcomed the weather.
   ``Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,''
said Bill Becker, chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission.
Temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put the trees
into a dormant phase, which give them greater resistance to cold in
the future, he said.
   Amtrak reported delays of two hours Monday on trains between New
York and Washington because of weather-related problems in a fiber
optics cable which handles switches, said spokeswoman Sue Martin.
Temporary repairs were made by afternoon.
   Shelters for the homeless were full overnight in the District of
Columbia. And officials said two vans were on the street overnight
to provide warm food and drinks to homeless people who either
couldn't find shelter or refused to go indoors.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Friday announced the
opening of a 200-bed shelter at a Newton armory after renovations.
John Rood said the 730-bed Pine Street Inn in Boston was full
Sunday, with some people staying in the lobby. ``On any given
night, we are serving 1,000 people,'' Rood said.
   A low of 18 and wind chill of minus 10 to minus 25, plus already
crowded shelters, forced Philadelphia officials to add 125 beds for
the homeless, to a total of 2,975.
   A ferocious weekend snowstorm in northern Maine left Caribou
under 21 inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, and
high wind Monday caused widespread drifting.
   Commuters in the area apparently heeded the cue to stay home,
said state police, who reported almost empty highways.
   Schools were closed in two counties of West Virginia, where the
remote community of Pickens, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, got 14
inches of snow.
   ``We're real used to it here,'' said Jim Biggs, a high school
principal and teacher.
   Lake-effect storms fed by moisture from Lake Erie moderated
after blanketing western New York. West Valley, south of Buffalo,
received 18 inches and nearby Chaffee got 15 inches, with 20- to
30-mph wind piling drifts up to 3 feet high, the weather service
said.
   Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern Ohio and
in western Pennsylvania.
   The cold was blamed for the deaths of one homeless man in
Springfield, Mass., one in Philadelphia and two in St. Paul, Minn.
   The weather was blamed for at least three deaths on New York
state roads and investigators blamed an overheated wood stove for a
fire that killed three people in Chautauqua County. One person was
killed in a crash on an icy Montana road.

   Ordinary East Germans are glad the old order
is gone and seem to feel it's been worth the risk, even though they
worry about an uncertain future.
   ``Right now, the situation is nothing but chaos,'' said Michael
Scholz, 24, one of dozens of East Berliners interviewed one day
after the Communist Party chief Egon Krenz and the entire party
leadership resigned.
   ``No one knows what's up,'' said Thomas Fieberlkorn. ``That
those involved in the corruption are gone is good, but what comes
now is unknown.''
   ``New Forum itself has no real perspective,'' he said of the
largest opposition group, which claims a membership of 200,000.
   Opposition groups have grown rapidly in two months of
pro-democracy protest, but have not put forth long-term programs.
   ``Maybe Hans Modrow can salvage something,'' Fiebelkorn said of
the premier who is emerging as the nation's main political figure.
``We continue to go to work and hope that things will get better.''
   East Germany has serious economic problems, intensified by the
mass exodus to West Germany of nearly 300,000 people, most of them
young, skilled workers.
   In 40 years of communism, East Germany attained a relatively
high standard of living compared with other Soviet Bloc countries,
but its industry is outdated and the communications network near
collapse.
   Business was done as usual Monday on Leipziger Street, a broad
shopping avenue, but the resignations and reports of widespread
corruption under the old guard Krenz's people replaced were on
people's minds.
   ``I'm not disappointed this happened,'' Scholz said, ``but what
lies in the future? New Fourm, they themselves don't know what to
do. They know what was wrong, but have no concept of what to do and
no one who can take over.''
   Mareike Boettger, 28, expressed outrage at reports of massive
corruption in the party and reports that top officials led
luxurious lives.
   ``I don't have anything against a high politician having a
little luxury, but what they have done is shameless,'' she said.
``We are glad they are out.''
   Of East Germans leaving for the West, she said: ``Those people
who are still going there are doing it just for material things. We
have to stay here and rebuild out economy.
   ``To do that we will need foreign investments. We know there
will be many problems, but I have never given a thought to leaving
here.'' Ms. Boettger works at an export company.
   Heike Nestler said officials found guilty of corruption should
be punished severely, because ``they obtained their luxury at our
expense and the expense of their own children.
   Young people led the movement for democratic reforms because of
the lack of freedom, she said.
   ``It wasn't that we had it bad. We had everything. Young mothers
have state-run kindergartens, a lot of support to raise children.
But there was no freedom to travel. To get permission to travel you
had to kneel on the ground and beg.''
   Mario Kalischer, 26, walking his wife Isabina, 21, said he was a
Communist Party member, and ``for us, this corruption is a big
disappointment.''
   ``We no longer trusted them. Even Krenz. ... Those people were
supposed to set an example.
   ``I find it good that they are out. ... It needed to be cleaned
out completely. But what happens now, that's the big question?
Without the party nothing will work.''

   Just days before the Soviet-American summit
meeting, a Soviet vessel left Leningrad for Nicaragua carrying four
helicopters with potential military use, Bush administration
sources said Monday.
   The reported shipment, due to arrive in Corinto, Nicaragua, on
Dec. 18, comes as the Sandinista Army is staging a substantial
buildup in northern Nicaragua not far from base camps of the Contra
rebels in southern Honduras.
   While some officials expressed concern about the potential
military impact of the MI-17 helicopters, they said the Soviets are
likely to contend the aircraft are for commercial purposes.
   Because such aircraft normally are sent to Nicaragua without
weapons mounted on them, the delivery would not appear to
contradict the reaffirmation Sunday by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that his country has ceased arms deliveries to Central
America.
   But the sources, who asked not to be identified, said the MI-17
has been used extensively by the Sandinista armed forces for
carrying troops and as gunships. In the past, they said, MI-17's
have been converted on arrival in Nicaragua for military use
against the Contras.
   President Bush has said he does not challenge Gorbachev's
assertions but has expressed concern about what he has descibed as
a continuing flow of Soviet bloc weaponry through Nicaragua to
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   At his news conference in Brussels on Monday, Bush acknowldged
that he and Gorbachev have ``big differences'' on Central America.
He said he would like Gorbachev to use his influence to
``facilitate democratic change'' in the Western Hemisphere.
   The sources said the Sandinistas now have about 38 MI-17's in
their inventory. The MI-17 is an advanced version of the MI-8
helicopter and is more easily adaptable than the MI-8 for use as a
gunship.
   Since there are already many MI-17's in Nicaragua, one official
said the new shipment could not necessarily be considered a
provocation. The official said the Sandinistas already have enough
MI-17's and described the additional helicopters as unnecessary.
   He added that the delivery probably had been in the planning
stage for months and that it may have been a coincidence that the
ship carrying the helicopters left Leningrad just before the
Mediterranean summit.
   The U.S. officials, citing intelligence reports, said the
shipment left Leningrad aboard the vessel Vladimir Ilyich.
   The MI-17 delivery to Nicaragua, as U.S. officials see it,
appears to be more closely related to the internal situation in
that country than to El Salvador.
   National elections are set for Feb. 25 and the Sandinista
government is angry that the Contra rebels continue to operate not
only inside Nicaragua but also remain deployed at base camps in
Honduras.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and four other Central
American presidents called in August for the demobilization of the
rebels by this Tuesday, but that deadline will pass with the
resistance forces still intact.
   The Contras, backed by the Bush administration, have pointed out
that the Central American presidents specified that the
demobilization must be ``voluntary'' and carried out only if the
rebels can return safely to their homeland.
   Five weeks ago, Ortega suspended a truce that had been in effect
for 19 months, accusing the rebels of engaging in terrorist
activities. The Contras, who continue to receive non-lethal U.S.
aid, said the only offensive action during the truce period had
been carried out by the Sandinista Army.
   Aggravating the situation was the collapse on Nov. 21 of
cease-fire talks in Washington between the Sandinistas and the
Contras.

   A federal appeals court on Monday upheld
San Francisco's agreement to hire and promote women and minorities
in the white male-dominated Fire Department.
   In a 3-0 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
a union claim that the plan violated the rights of white men by
setting numerical goals for minority and female employment and by
requiring the promotion of 33 minority firefighters.
   The agreement, approved in a consent decree by U.S. District
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in June 1988, ``is fundamentally fair,
adequate and reasonable,'' said the opinion by Judge David Thompson.
   The court noted the department had no blacks until 1955 and no
women until 1987, and the city's hiring and promotional tests for
firefighters had repeatedly been found discriminatory from 1970 to
1987.
   Thompson said the decree met the standards for race- and
sex-based remedies set by the Supreme Court: a ``manifest
imbalance'' between representation of groups in the Fire Department
and the population, and the fashioning of a plan that does not
unnecessarily hurt whites and males.
   The decree, which ended 18 years of lawsuits by minorities and
women, was challenged by Firefighters Union Local 798, with the
support of the Reagan administration.
   As the litigation neared a climax, a swastika was found in the
office of two minority firefighters in December 1987. Patel
pronounced the department ``out of control'' and ordered top
officials to enforce rules against racial and sexual harassment
under threat of contempt of court. Shortly afterward, Fire Chief Ed
Phipps resigned.
   The appeals court upheld Patel's order in Monday's ruling,
saying there was ``ample evidence of foot-dragging'' by the
department in enforcing its rules against harassment.
   When the decree on hiring and promotions was signed, the
department had 225 minorities and seven women on its staff of 1,100.
   The plan sets long-term goals of 40 percent minorities and 10
percent women in the department, and goals of 55 percent minority
hiring and 10 percent female hiring through 1994.
   The appeals court ordered the plan modified to eliminate the
hiring standards before 1994 if the long-term goals were met by
then.
   The plan also requires the city to prepare new, unbiased
examinations for hiring and promotion, and to promote 33 minority
firefighters to the rank of lieutenant. An additional 48 promotions
are optional, of which 12 must be minorities.
   Thompson rejected the union's argument that the plan was
discriminatory by requiring the promotion of minorities but not of
whites. No evidence was presented of past discrimination against
whites, he said.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief aide
said Monday the crippled East German Communist Party is unable to
act and has lost its support.
   The aide, Rudolf Seiters, has been negotiating with with East
German leaders about financial aid, in exchange for which West
Germany wants assurances of free elections and economic reform.
   He also has been laying the groundwork for a Kohl visit to East
Germany this month, but no date has been set.
   Seiters told the Norddeutscher Rundfunk radio he assumes he will
return to East Germany this week to resume his talks, despite the
resignation of the ruling party Politburo and Central Committee.
   The party is ``now incapable of action, in a deep crisis'' and
has ``lost the trust of its supporters, its members and the people
in the German Democratic Republic,'' he said.
   West Germany has a ``responsibility to help in humanitarian
areas ... regardless of the events'' in the Communist Party, he
added.
   In East Germany, Seiters said, he probably will meet with
Premier Hans Modrow, a reformer who is emerging as the country's
main political figure. The Kohl aide indicated he also might speak
with members of Modrow's Cabinet, which includes some
non-Communists.
   West Germany has proposed establishing a hard-currency fund for
East Germans who use their new travel freedom to visit the West.
East Germany's currency is non-convertible, making it difficult for
East Germans to buy goods in the West.
   So far, East Germany has not been willing to meet Bonn's demand
that, in exchange, it stop requiring West Germans to pay 25 marks
($13) each time they enter East Germany.
   West Germany also wants the East German government to contribute
substantially to the proposed fund.

   The leftist political
opposition and humanitarian groups labeled as subversive for
working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the
country by a climate of persecution.
   Eileen Rosin, the sole representative of the Los Angeles-based
Medical Aid for El Salvador, left the country Monday after
discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend.
   Neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it
before dawn Saturday.
   For eight years, Medical Aid has distributed money for
prosthetic devices, delivered donated medicines to hospitals and
sent dozens of children to the United States for operations beyond
the technical means of Salvadoran hospitals.
   Ms. Rosin, 35, had worked in El Salvador for two years and left
reluctantly for Los Angeles.
   ``We had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the
States. I don't know what will happen to them now,'' she said.
   The United Nations on Friday said it will transfer its
Salvadoran offices to Guatemala ``for lack of guarantees.''
   Officials found equipment and furniture at the main U.N. offices
smashed following fighting last week around the building, in the
affluent neighborhood of Escalon.
   Army troops had occupied the offices, which administered UNICEF
and refugee projects, after U.N. personnel were evacuated. When
U.N. officials returned, they found scrawled on the walls: ``U.N.
equals FMLN equals Traitors.''
   The letters stand for Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of
the 10-year-old civil war.
   The U.S.-backed government of rightist Alfredo Cristiani
responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended
constitutional guarantees.
   Hundreds of people have been detained since, including two dozen
foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups. Almost
all the non-Salvadorans have been deported, although some remain
jailed facing charges.
   Foreigners who work with the poor are called
``internationalists,'' and they are a favorite target of the right,
which accuses them of supporting revolution.
   A flier signed ``Salvadoran air force,'' considered the most
rightist branch of the armed forces, was found strewn on city
streets over the weekend.
   ``With God, reason and might, we shall conquer,'' it said.
``Salvadoran patriot: You have every right to defend your life and
your property. If in order to do this you have to kill FMLN
terrorists and their internationalist allies, do it.''
   ``We are in the catacombs. There is no prospect for above-ground
humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term,'' said
Episcopalian Rev. Luis Serrano, whose church has for years done
social, medical and educational work with displaced people and
refugees.
   He commented in an interview in Mariona prison, where he and
eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the crackdown by
the government and armed forces was ``absolutely appropriate.''
   Washington has provided $4 billion in aid this decade to the
Salvadoran government in the war, which has killed 71,000 people,
1,000 of them in the latest fighting.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker likened the raids and arrests to
the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
   ``I'm not condoning it. But in times like these of great emotion
and great anger, things like this happen. Even in the U.S., with
all its guarantees, it happened,'' Walker said.
   ``There are a series of indications of a climate of
persecution,'' said Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary
bishop of San Salvador, after Mass on Sunday. ``Not only against
personnel of the Catholic church, but against many people who try
to help the most humble and the most poor.''
   ``It appears that the military authorities, in their quest to
restore order, have adopted as their criteria the saying, `Think
the worst, and you'll be right,''' he said.
   The climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes. One goes like
this:
   Two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the
beginning of the nightly curfew. They pass a man walking quickly in
the opposite direction. One soldier turns around and fatally shoots
the man.
   ``Why'd you do that?'' asks his companion.
   ``I know that guy. He lives 20 minutes from here.''

   The last obstacle between Leona Helmsley and
sentencing was lifted Monday when a judge refused to set aside her
tax evasion conviction.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who is portrayed in advertisements as the queen
of her luxury hotels, was convicted Aug. 30 of evading $1.2 million
in federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her business
empire.
   By denying a request to overturn the conviction and dismiss the
charges, U.S. District Judge John Walker cleared the way for her
Dec. 12 sentencing.
   The judge ruled that prosecutors did not use tainted evidence
against Mrs. Helmsley. Mrs. Helmsley's lawyers based their request
on allegations that prosecutors improperly used the testimony she
gave to grand juries in 1985.
   At the time, the state was investigating possible sales tax
evasion by jewelers, furriers and other retailers. Because Mrs.
Helmsley was granted immunity, prosecutors were legally barred from
using the testimony in the later income tax case.
   ``The court is satisfied that the government's evidence used in
the federal grand jury and at trial was derived from sources
independent of Mrs. Helmsley's immunized testimony on unrelated
matters,'' Walker said in a written decision.
   Her attorney, Gerald Feffer, said he had not seen Walker's
decision and could not comment.
   At sentencing, the 69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley could receive
punishment ranging from community service to 127 years in prison if
Walker imposes consecutive sentences on 33 tax-related counts. She
also could face more than $7 million in fines.
   Mrs. Helmsley's 80-year-old husband, Harry, heads a $5 billion
real estate and hotel empire. He was charged with his wife and the
others but was found incompetent to stand trial.

<HEAD>Court Says Palestinian as Suspect, Approves Seizure of Evidence</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 4 grafs new to restore full name of Mohammed Abu Talb.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UPPSALA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court affirmed Monday that a
Palestinian facing charges of murder is also a suspect in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, and it approved the seizure of
evidence in a raid on his apartment.
   Mohammed Abu Talb, 35, is believed to be the first suspect to
face a court proceeding in connection with the bombing of the jumbo
jet Dec. 21, 1988, over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
   ``The court finds that Abu Talb is suspected in Scotland of
murder or as an accessory to murder,'' the brief District Court
ruling said.
   Clothing seized in the raid ``can be presumed to carry
importance for the investigation,'' it said.
   The court classified its hearing records as secret and ordered
any evidence removed from Sweden to be returned when the
investigation is completed. Abu Talb, listed in court documents as
Abo Talb, appeared at a closed hearing Friday.
   A verdict in the case of Abu Talb and three other Palestinians
is expected Dec. 21. Their trial ended Nov. 15 on charges of murder
and attempted murder in four bombings in Copenhagen, Amsterdam and
Stockholm in 1985 and 1986.
   Jamila Mograbi, who is divorced from Abu Talb but still lives
with him, denied he was involved in the Pan Am bombing, but would
not discuss the other charges.
   ``We are short of money. It's obvious that my husband is not
some kind of terrorist, because terrorists have money,'' she told
The Associated Press.
   Abu Talb is a former member of the Palestine Popular Struggle
Front, a group based in Syria that rejects compromise with Israel
and opposes Yasser Arafat, chief of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Ahmed Jibril's radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command is the group most often accused of the
Pan Am attack.
   Ms. Mograbi said three Scottish detectives and seven Swedish
officers searched the apartment last week for clothing traceable to
Malta in the Mediterranean, virtually emptying the closets and
filling 15 plastic bags, she said.
   Under Swedish law, evidence cannot be taken for a foreign
investigation, or removed from the country, unless a court
authorizes it.
   Investigators are said to have identified clothing originating
in Malta from the suitcase they believe contained the bomb.
   They believe the bomb may have gone on an Air Malta flight to
Frankfurt, where the Pan Am 103 originated. The flight changed
planes in London and was bound for New York.
   Ms. Mograbi, 28, said Abu Talb brought three sweaters and a pair
of jeans from Malta in October 1988. She said they were wholesale
samples he intended to show retailers, with the idea of importing
such clothing.
   Abu Talb was looking for a new business after his video store
failed, she said, adding that he went to Malta to recover from a
stab wound suffered in a quarrel.
   Police arrested Abu Talb in May, along with two of Miss
Mograbi's brothers and a fourth Palestinian, in connection with the
four bombings.
   ``Even if you are suspected of one crime, it doesn't mean you
committed another,'' she said in the interview Monday.
   According to court documents, Abu Talb came to Sweden in 1986 on
a false Moroccan passport. Miss Mograbi said the couple has lived
in Sweden for six years.
   Court records say Abu Talb was born in Lebanon, served in the
Egyptian army, underwent military training in the Soviet Union,
deserted the army and fled to Lebanon, where he joined the
Palestine Popular Struggle Front.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Pit Bull Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the first case of its kind, the owner
of a pit bull dog went on trial Monday in the murder of a toddler
mauled after wandering into the dog's path while, prosecutors say,
it was guarding 243 marijuana plants.
   Jury selection began in Santa Clara County Superior Court for
Michael Berry, 39, of Morgan Hill. Berry is charged with
second-degree murder for the June 13, 1987, death of his 2-year-old
neighbor, James Soto, who died of severe blood loss after being
attacked by the Berry's pit bull named Willy.
   Berry also faces felony marijuana cultivation charges.
   According to the prosecutor and the Humane Society of the United
States, the trial marks the first time in this country that a pet
owner has been charged with murder because of an animal's actions.
   Deputy District Attorney Dale Sanderson acknowledged there is no
evidence of malice or intent to kill young Soto, but said the
prosecution is based on the theory of implied malice. That allows a
murder conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard
for human life.
   ``What we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for
aggressiveness and to be a combatant,'' Sanderson said during
Berry's arraignment two years ago. ``And, knowing the dog's
propensity, he places him in an area accessible to all _ including
children.''
   During a search of Berry's home, authorities said they found
several publications on illegal dog fighting, and a dog-sized
conditioning treadmill.
   A gag order was issued last month, barring both sides from
discussing the case.
   James Soto's father, Arthur, said he and his wife had left James
playing with new toy trucks on their back patio while they went
shopping at garage sales. When they returned, the father said he
found their son being ``torn apart'' by the pit bull after
apparently wandering through an open gate and into the unfenced
yard of their neighbor. The child never regained consciousness.
   At least 157 people have died from dog attacks nationwide in the
past 10 years, 70 percent of them under the age of 10, according to
the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   But of those cases, the Humane Society of the United States said
only one owner has been convicted of a major felony. Hayward
Turnipseed of De Kalb County, Ga., was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison after three of
his pit bulls killed a 4-year-old boy in 1987.
   Berry has contended that he has been singled out because his dog
attacked a child at a time when the breed was the center of
considerable negative publicity.
   ``I think a murder rap is overdoing it by a lot,'' said Sanford
Kadish, a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``If this is the highest form of crime, then what do we
do with the hired killer or the serial rapist?''
   Kadish and other lega experts have speculated that Berry was
charged with second-degree murder in an effort to force him to
plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter instead.
   Berry faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.
   While Berry goes on trial, his dog, Willy, remains at the Santa
Clara animal shelter.
   He has not been destroyed because he is considered evidence in
the case, and he is described as a friendly and affectionate dog.
But shelter spokeswoman Stacy Hill said Willy nevertheless will be
destroyed at the conclusion of the legal battle.

Warsaw Pact nations, meeting in Moscow, said the invasion
constitituted ``interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign
Czechoslovakia.''
   _ President Bush, in Brussels, said it's too early to proclaim
an end to the Cold War, but added that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
acceptance of sweeping reform in Eastern Europe ``absolutely
mandates new thinking'' by the West. He also endorsed a cautious
and measured approach to reunifying Germany.
   _ Bush said his weekend meeting with Gorbachev gave the two
leaders a chance to cement a personal relationship, although ``it
wasn't all sweetness and light.''

<TEXT>
   The next summit meeting of five
Central American presidents will be held in Costa Rica Dec. 10-12,
sources close to President Oscar Arias said Monday.
   The meeting, which had been scheduled for Nicaragua, probably
will be in Heredia, nine miles from the capital of San Jose,
according to the sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   Plans to hold the summit in Managua were canceled because
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani refused to go to Nicaragua.
   Cristiani suspended relations with Managua last week after two
planes, allegedly smuggling arms from Nicaragua to leftist rebels
in El Salvador, were found in Salvadoran territory. One crashed and
the four crewmen perished, and the other was burned by its crew at
a landing strip because the craft was out of fuel, according to
Salvadoran officials.
   The presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and
El Salvador, at their meeting last August in Tela, Honduras, agreed
to demobilize the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, by Dec. 5.
Next week's meeting is supposed to review the relocation of the
Contras, thousands of whom live in camps across the border in
Honduras.
   Most of the Contras, who have been fighting the Sandinista
government for eight years, refuse to disband and be relocated
until after Nicaragua's elections, scheduled for February.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who had insisted that the
meeting be held in his country, relented over the weekend and
agreed to meet in Costa Rica, the sources reported.
   They said there were offers to hold the summit in Argentina, but
Arias insisted it be held in the region. Arias has said all the
presidents except Ortega agreed on Guatemala as a replacement site
for Managua.
   ``All the Central American foreign ministers are pressuring that
the summit be held in a hotel with conveniences, not only for the
presidents, but also for the press,'' said a Nicaraguan diplomat
who asked not to be identified.
   The Costa Rican location most frequently mentioned is the
Central American Insitute for Business Administration in Heredia.
   Also attending the meeting will be Joao Baena Soares,
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, and
representatives of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
the Nicaraguan diplomat said.

<HEAD>Diary Shows Mencken Was Anti-Semitic, Racist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The previously secret diary of writer and
social critic H.L. Mencken reveals virulent anti-Semitism, racism
and pro-Nazi leanings, shocking even the sympathetic Mencken
scholar who edited it.
   The diary, type-written on 2,100 pages from 1930 to 1948, was
sealed on Mencken's instructions for 25 years after his death in
1956. The (Baltimore) Evening Sun, where Mencken once worked,
published excerpts Monday.
   On the subject of Jews, Mencken wrote in December 1943 that the
Maryland Club had decided against admitting any more Jewish members
after the only one on its rolls died. ``There is no other Jew in
Baltimore who seems suitable,'' he said.
   Of blacks, he wrote in September 1943, ``... it is impossible to
talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman.
They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does
not teach them anything.''
   On Oct. 24, 1945, he wrote that ``the course of the United
States in World War II ... was dishonest, dishonorable and
ignominious, and the Sunpapers, in supporting Roosevelt's foreign
policy, shared in this disgrace.''
   The book, ``The Diary of H.L. Mencken,'' was edited by Mencken
scholar Charles A. Fecher of Baltimore and published by Alfred A.
Knopf.
   Mencken is revered by many writers and journalists for his
erudite writing and often brilliant social and political criticism.
The National Press Club in Washington has a library named in his
honor and The (Baltimore) Sun bestows an annual writing award named
for him.
   He spent 40 years at The Evening Sun, edited the Smart Set and
the American Mercury magazines, wrote dozens of books, and
contributed to numerous other publications.
   ``His feelings about World War II are incredible in a man of his
intelligence, knowledge and perception,'' Fecher wrote in his
introduction to the book. ``He seems to have had no conception at
all of what a German-Japanese victory would have meant to the
civilized world, or to the liberties that he himself so cherished.''
   Mencken's attitude toward blacks ``was a curious mingling of
total egalitarianism ... and patronizing superiority,'' Fecher
wrote.
   Mencken regularly published black writers in American Mercury;
persuaded his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, to publish their books;
was cordial to black journalists, and had his portrait painted by a
black artist.
   The last article he wrote for The Evening Sun in 1948 attacked
segregation laws in Baltimore.
   But the diary reveals Mencken's ``deeply ingrained conviction
that black people were by their very nature inferior to white,''
Fecher wrote.
   Fecher said the writer's own words may permanently diminish his
reputation.
   ``Like everybody else who is going to read it, I was shocked,''
said Fecher, 72. ``It has tempered my admiration for Mencken and
made me aware of weaknesses I had not known.''
   Fecher defended Mencken against charges of anti-Semitism in his
1978 book, ``Mencken: A Study of His Thought.''
   ``Today I would be much less ready to take such a stand. Let it
be said at once, clearly and unequivocally: Mencken was an
anti-Semite,'' wrote Fecher.
   Mencken's diary tells of his pleasure that a North Carolina
resort he enjoyed visiting excludes Jews, and expresses annoyance
when Jews moved into his neighborhood.
   His closest associates at the Baltimore newspapers revered his
memory, but he dismisses virtually all of them as ``third raters,''
``non-entities'' and worse.
   ``The diaries are almost sick. I mean he hated everybody,'' said
Gwinn Owens, a former editor and columnist on The Evening Sun whose
father, Hamilton Owens, was a long-time Sunpapers editor and friend
of Mencken's.
   In the diary, Mencken dismisses Owens as ``a time-server with no
more principles than a privy rat.''
   ``One of the things that really hurts ... is that after Mencken
had his stroke, my father went to see him every week, sat with him
and talked with him,'' Gwinn Owens said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. economists and business leaders expressed
general support Monday for President Bush's actions at the Malta
summit to support Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' restructuring efforts.
   ``Malta is a long-run affair with all kinds of great promise,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``One should be
cautious, but there are great hopes and optimism that a new era is
dawning.''
   Dwayne O. Andreas, chief executive of the agricultural giant,
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., said that ``unleashing
the forces of free-enterprise can't be anything but beneficial.''
   The analysts were asked their views of Bush's statements and
actions of recent days in connection with Gorbachev's efforts to
revamp an ailing economy.
   Bush lent encouragement to that effort. But during a news
conference in Brussels, Belgium Monday following his briefing of
NATO leaders, Bush said chances were ``slim and none'' that
Gorbachev would be invited to join the world's seven richest
countries at their economic summit meeting next July.
   Bush said the Soviets need to do much more to reform their
government-controlled economic system before they could be
considered for inclusion in the annual economic summits attended by
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy.
   The next meeting is scheduled for early July in Houston.
Gorbachev had sent a letter to the world leaders at last summer's
meeting in Paris, asking to be included in the annual talks.
   But Bush told reporters he did not think it likely that the
Soviets would be participating in next year's summit, saying he saw
``two chances _ slim and none _ for that particular meeting.''
   Bush said that what was most important now was for Communist
countries trying to transform their economies to get expertise in
how market-based systems work.
   ``We have got to understand (Gorbachev's) dilemma. They have not
had a market economy,'' Bush said. ``It is important that not just
the Soviet Union but other countries in Eastern Europe understand
the market economies, understand the dynamism of the economic
systems that join (the seven economic summit) countries together.''
   The president announced several initiatives at his weekend
meeting with Gorbachev aimed at helping to integrate the Soviet
Union into the world economy. He pledged to remove high U.S.
tariffs levied on Soviet imports once the Soviets approve
legislation allowing free emigration. He also promised to support
observer status for the Soviet Union in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the 97-member international organization that
governs world trade.
   Observer status would not automatically entitle the Soviet Union
to various favorable trade concessions granted full GATT members,
but it would provide Soviet officials with first-hand knowledge of
the deliberations occurring in the organization.
   The United States had previously opposed Soviet requests for
observer status, maintaining that the Soviet system was
incompatible with GATT's free-trade principles.
   Andreas said that Bush's promise to lower tariffs on Soviet
goods following approval of the liberalized emigration law should
foster reciprocal actions by the Soviets to purchase more American
goods, including farm products.
   Before the farm trade restrictions imposed by then-President
Jimmy Carter in retaliation for the Red Army invasion of
Afghanistan, American farmers supplied 70 percent of the
agricultural products imported by the Soviet Union. The U.S. share
of the Soviet agricultural market is now 45 percent.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said that it was
essential for Bush to provide some specific proposals to bolster
the reforms Gorbachev is trying to institute in the Soviet Union.
   ``If perestroika fails, it is going to fail because of
economics,'' Wyss said. ``We have much to lose by the Russians
failing. We should be helping them any way we can.''

   The St. Louis Sun has grabbed more than
100,000 readers a day in its first two months of publication, but
hasn't drawn readers away from the established St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, executives of the two newspapers said Monday.
   In fact, Post-Dispatch officials sounded almost grateful to the
upstart Sun, which is the newest newspaper in the country.
   ``I do firmly believe that the Post-Dispatch is a much better
newspaper today than it was a year ago,'' Nicholas Penniman IV,
publisher of the Post-Dispatch and vice president of the Pulitzer
Publishing Co., said at an annual editors meeting.
   David Lipman, managing editor of the Post-Dispatch, said the new
competition has accelerated changes that were in the works at the
111-year-old newspaper and given it a jolt of adrenalin.
   ``The Post-Dispatch feels 10 years younger. And we're going to
continue feeling young and being useful and still be a lot of
fun,'' he said.
   The Sun, which debuted Sept. 25, has been averaging about
107,000 circulation for its first two months, while the
Post-Dispatch's circulation has remained steady at 378,000 daily
and 565,000 on Sunday.
   The Post-Dispatch's Saturday newspaper has increased its
circulation about 3 percent to 348,000 since the Sun began
appearing with an expanded Saturday paper that costs $1 compared to
25 cents for the Saturday Post-Dispatch.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, the Sun's editor-in-chief and chairman of
its parent company, Ingersoll Publications Co., said he expected
the Sun to turn a profit by the end of 1990.
   However, he said profits won't be as high as originally
projected because the newspaper is attracting more home subscribers
and fewer newsstand buyers than expected. Home subscribers pay less.
   Ingersoll brushed aside talk of a ``newspaper war'' in St. Louis.
   ``We look on it as a competition, which is something different
than a war,'' he said.
   Before the debut of the Sun, the Post-Dispatch had been without
competition since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in Oct. 1986.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chided
President Bush at their Malta summit for not granting visas to
thousands of Soviet citizens who want to live in the United States,
a Soviet spokesman said Monday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said on the
flight back to Moscow that Bush raised the human rights issue by
giving Gorbachev a list of divided spouses the United States claims
are separated by Soviet refusal to grant one or the other an exit
visa.
   Presentation of such lists, thousands of names long until
recently, has been a ritual at high-level meetings for years. The
lists have shrunk steadily under Gorbachev, however, and only a few
people are on the latest one.
   When Bush presented it during talks on the Soviet cruise ship
Maxim Gorky, Gerasimov said, ``We had a very long list of Soviet
citizens who want to go to the United States and can't get visas,
which is a little bit against the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.''
   Gerasimov told reporters later he was joking about the Soviets
giving Bush a list, but said Gorbachev did respond to the U.S.
presentation by reminding Bush that thousands of Soviets seeking
visas line up outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow every day.
   The United States, inundated by the flood of people now being
allowed to emigrate, has drastically limited the number given
refugee status as victims of persecution and expects to turn away
200,000 in the next year.
   Soviet officials have estimated 4-5 million citizens will leave
the country under a new law permitting the departure of most people
who want to leave.
   Gerasimov said Bush had offered to begin negotiations on a trade
agreement without waiting for congressional approval of
most-favored-nation status, which the Soviets have been denieed
because they prevented free emigration.
   He said the Soviet side reacted ``very favorably'' to Bush's
proposal for halting production of binary chemical weapons.
Gerasimov called it an important initiative, ``one step in the
right direction'' toward a comprehensive chemical weapons ban.
   To illustrate Soviet concern about being surrounded by U.S.
military forces, Gorbachev gave Bush a classified map showing the
American bases that ring Soviet territory, Gerasimov said.
   The Kremlin is preparing to publish more information about its
military spending and production, he said.
   ``We promised under no circumstances ever to attack the United
States,'' he added, and feel America ``doesn't need all this
military hardware.''

   Militiamen allied with Israel shelled
two south Lebanon towns Monday, and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley, Hezbollah fighters drove Amal from three villages in
house-to-house combat, police said.
   Police said at least 15 people were killed and 48 wounded in the
two flareups.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is comprised of pro-Iranian
fundamentalists. Mainstream Amal is allied with Syria. The two
Shiite Moslem factions long have vied for control of the 1.2
million Shiites, the largest sect among Lebanon's 4 million
population.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, an Arab League commitee accused Gen.
Michel Aoun of blocking a settlement of the 14-year-old Lebanese
civil war, but urged the Christian commander and Syria to avoid a
new battle.
   President Elias Hrawi said Monday he was delaying for a few days
any decisive action to evict Aoun from the presidential palace in
Baabda, east of Beirut.
   The Arab League appeal came after a two-day meeting of its
committee on Lebanon.
   Aoun rejects a peace plan worked out at Taif, Saudi Arabia, in
October and approved by the Lebanese Parliament. He also says
Hrawi's election by Parliament last month was unconstitutional.
   His 20,000 Christian army troopers fought a six-month artillery
war with the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in Lebanon, which
ended in September with a truce arranged by the Arab League.
   The Syrians moved in additional troops, tanks and heavy
artillery, but the United States, the Soviet Union, the Vatican and
former colonial power France urged Syria to show moderation and
counseled dialogue to resolve the crisis.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran messaged Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa reiterating Iran's support for
Syria and denouncing ``Michel Aoun's ruffianism,'' the Islamic
Republic News Agency said Monday.
   A police spokesman said five people were killed and 12 wounded
in a seven-hour artillery barrage Monday against the town of Kfar
Rumman by the South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia
that helps Israel patrol the ``security zone'' just north of its
border with Lebanon.
   Six people were wounded in shelling of neighboring Nabatiyeh,
police said. They said all casualties were civilians in the two
towns, which have a combined population of 140,000.
   It was the third day militia gunners shelled the towns. Total
casualties there since Saturday stood at eight killed, 38 wounded.
   Militia radio Voice of the South broadcast a statement saying
the shelling was a response to two Shiite guerrilla assaults that
killed three militiamen and wounded five.
   Nabih Berri, whose Amal militia controls the towns, threatened
to bombard northern Israel if shelling continued.
   He urged Lebanon to seek an ``urgent debate by the U.N. Security
Council of the ongoing massacre in south Lebanon.''
   A Foreign Ministry statement said Lebanon reserved the right to
ask a council debate on ``the brutal attacks by Israel and its
surrogates in south Lebanon.''
   Israel set up the zone in 1985, when it withdrew the bulk of its
forces after occupying Lebanon for three years. The area varies in
depth from 6 to 10 miles and is meant to serve as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla raids.
   Amal fought Hezbollah at Sohmor and Yohmor in the western sector
of the Bekaa Valley, north of the security zone.
   Police said at least 10 people were killed and 30 wounded in
nine hours of fighting from house to house that ended with Amal
being driven from the two villages. No breakdown of killed or
wounded was available.
   The fighting later spread to Mashgara. Police said Hezbollah
fighters ousted Amal's garrison from the town, provincial capital
of the western Bekaa, in four hours of street battles.
   A police spokesman said about 50 Syrian soldiers based in
Mashgara made no move to help their Amal allies.
   He said among the wounded were Amal's security chief in the
western Bekaa, Mohammed al-Khishin, and the militia's military
commander of Sohmor, Mohammed Abbas.
   At least 535 people were killed and 1,490 wounded in previous
battles between the two militias since May 1987, according to
police figures.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
predicted Monday that random drug testing will reveal an ``alarming
amount of drug usage'' among people responsible for the safety of
land, air and sea transportation.
   Rules begin going into effect in two weeks that require random
and other drug tests for millions of airline, railroad, mass
transit, bus company, boat, trucking company and pipeline employees.
   Skinner said that where court orders do not stop the testing,
companies must comply with the new rule. Several suits have been
filed by workers to stop the federally imposed program. Startup
dates for the testing vary by modes of transportation.
   The secretary said he has set up a group in his office to
monitor progress of the testing, while agencies dealing with
aviation, railroads and other modes would each oversee industries
they cover.
   ``Once they begin the testing, I think we'll see an alarming
amount of drug use and positive testing in safety-related jobs,''
said Skinner at a session with reporters.
   He said he expects the results to justify the high priority the
administration has given the program.
   Random drug tests in the military showed high drug use in the
first few months, he said. Ten percent of tested Coast Guard
personnel showed positive, but the incidence has since dropped to 2
percent because of the testing, he said.
   Skinner said the government would not be lenient with companies
that do not make an effort to begin drug-testing programs.
   ``I don't want to be unfair,'' he said, but ``the time has come
where we've got to move forward on this testing. We're not going to
sit here and tell somebody who is required by law or regulation to
conduct the test that they can just wait until they are ready.''
   Possible action against employers, including civil penalties or
withholding of federal funds, varies by transportation modes.
   Skinner said that ``with rare exception'' airlines have
submitted drug-testing plans that have been approved. The Federal
Aviation Administration extended the August deadline after several
smaller airlines failed to submit their programs.
   The secretary said he had been told by more than one mass
transit operator to expect high rates of drug usage when the
testing begins, possibly significantly higher than the 10 percent
found in the Coast Guard.
   Results should vary in different parts of the country and in
different modes of transportation, Skinner said, but added, ``I
know it's a major problem all over this country.''
   Asked what effect high drug use might have on the continuation
of transportation services, Skinner said, ``If the percentages were
40 percent, it would be devastating. If it were 5 percent, they
could probably work their way through it.''

<HEAD>Twenty Poles To Recieve Agricultural Training In U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty Polish agriculturalists will be trained
in the United States next year through a fellowship program
designed to educate foreign farm program administrators in American
methods, said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter on Monday.
   Yeutter said $90,000 has been set aside through the Cochran
Middle Income Country Fellowship Program for Polish participants.
   ```We look forward not only to increasing trade opportunities
for U.S. commodities in Poland through this program, but also to
increasing goodwill between the people of both countries,'' said
Yeutter, as he returned from a four-day economic mission in Poland.
   Thirty-nine participants from Poland received agriculture and
agribusiness training in the United States last April. It was the
largest group among the 16 countries that participated this year.
   The program, named for Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., is
administered through the Agriculture Department's office of
international cooperation and development.
   Yeutter said sales of breeding stock and animals, grains, seeds
and high-value products have resulted from past fellowships.

<HEAD>Arctic Air Sends Chills Into Florida; Records Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A blast of Arctic air sent shivers as far south as Florida on
Monday, cracking low temperature records in cities across the
South. Another cold front brought heavy rainfall to the Pacific
Northwest.
   Almost the entire eastern half of the country recorded freezing
temperatures overnight as stiff north winds blew cold air south out
of Canada. Readings dipped into the single digits in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, upper Michigan and the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Only southern Louisiana and southern and central Florida were
able to hold the temperature above freezing. In Lakeland, one of
nine Florida cities reporting new record lows for the date, the low
of 31 degrees was 8 degrees below the previous record for the date.
   Morning lows were in the 20s and 30s in the Great Plains, and
below 20 from eastern Minnesota through the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley and Tennessee Valley to the Atlantic Coast.
   Lows were in the 40s in south central Texas, and above 50 along
the northern and central Pacific Coast and over parts of Southern
California and southern Arizona.
   Temperatures dipped into the teens and single numbers across
parts of the plateau and Rocky Mountain region. The low for the
nation Monday morning was 4 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Strong northerly winds ushering the Arctic air into the
Northeast drove wind chill readings well below zero overnight. A
wind chill advisory remained in effect Monday afternoon for the
central highlands and western mountains of Maine.
   A storm warning was in effect for the coast of Maine and New
Hampshire.
   Strong winds blew down the eastern slopes of the northern
Rockies and a high wind warning was posted for the upper
Yellowstone Valley of Montana. Winds gusted to 69 mph at
Livingston, Mont.
   A cold front brought rainshowers to the Northwest, with heavy
rain along the Washington and Oregon coast. Heavier rainfall totals
for the six hour period ending at 10 a.m. PST included more than an
inch at Fort Lewis, Wash., and Tacoma, Wash., and nearly an inch at
Olympia, Wash., and Astoria, Ore.
   Astoria received more than 2 inches of rain during the 24 hours
ending at 4 a.m. PST.
   There were snow showers over parts of the Great Lakes region and
the upper Ohio Valley during the morning and early afternoon.
   Sunny skies and brisk southwest winds were helping temperatures
warm into 50s and 60s in the southern and central Plains, and the
strong winds along the eastern slopes of the northern Rockies
helped temperatures warm into the 40s and 50s in Montana.
   Among the low temperature records set Monday were 27 degrees in
Apalachicola, Fla., 39 in Fort Myers, Fla., 20 in Greer, S.C., 20
in Jackson, Miss., 20 in Meridian, Miss., 47 at the Miami airport,
25 in Mobile, Ala., 22 in Monroe, La., 40 in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
33 in Tampa, Fla., and 28 in Waco, Texas.

   Sheet and rill erosion on cropland decreased
by a half ton per acre nationwide between 1982 and 1987, dropping
from 4.3 tons to 3.8 tons per acre a year, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   However, wind erosion on cropland increased 0.1 ton per acre to
3.3 tons per acre a year, said the National Resources Inventory
report from the department's soil conservation service.
   According to the data, sheet and rill erosion nationwide totals
1.6 billion tons per year and wind erosion 1.4 billion tons
annually.
   The survey ``reveals impressive gains for soil conservation,''
said the Center for Resource Economics, a Washington-based
non-profit environmental research and publishing organization.
   But the research also shows that soil erosion is still a serious
problem, it said in a statement released Monday.
   ``From everything we know about land use in the mid-1970s,
erosion conditions worsened with the onset of the export boom,''
said Ken Cook, vice president of the center.
   He said analysis of the survey data may show that the
improvement in erosion control is due substantially to massive
idling of cropland under government programs between 1984 and 1987.
   The Agriculture Department said the report does not reflect the
work under way on about 140 million acres of highly erodible land
as part of the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law.
   Rural nonfederal land now totals 1.4 billion acres. Of this
422.8 million acres are cropland, 401.7 million acres are
rangeland, 394.4 million acres are forestland and 59.9 million aces
are in minor land uses, the survey says.

   East Germans outraged by the corruption of
ousted Communist Party leaders tried to storm secret police offices
Monday to make certain evidence for criminal trials is not removed.
   Prosecutors blocked access by the former officials to evidence
that could be used against them in the widening corruption
investigation.
   State television showed pictures of people joining police at
luxurious government guest houses and at warehouses in East Berlin
and Potsdam to block any efforts to remove documents.
   Officials appealed for calm as people tried to force their way
into secret police offices in Erfurt.
   In Leipzig, where about 200,000 people attended a rally calling
for German unification, 30 demonstrators were allowed inside the
secret police headquarters, including opposition leader Wolfgang
Schnur.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the group was let
in ``after massive demands of demonstrators who had surrounded the
building.'' It said the protesters presented their grievances and
departed but 200 other demonstrators who refused to leave were
permitted inside later to tour the building.
   Parts of the building were sealed off to prevent documents from
being smuggled out and Schnur said citizens would take part in
making sure the papers remained there.
   Wolfgang Schwanitz, new chief of national security, ordered
flights to Romania halted because of reports that sensitive
material was being smuggled to the Warsaw Pact ally, whose leader,
Nicolae Ceausescu, has rejected reform.
   Officials said there was no proof documents were being sent
there. Opposition sources said earlier that important documents
were taken from party headquarters to Schoenfeld airport for
flights to Romania.
   Premier Hans Modrow, who emerged as the leading political figure
one day after the entire Communist Party leadership resigned, was
not in East Germany. He led a three-member delegation to the Warsaw
Pact summit in Moscow
   At the huge Leipzig rally, the crowd applauded and cheered as
speakers called for a united Germany. Demonstrators waved dozens of
West German flags in front of the secret police headquarters. One
flag was draped over a surveillance camera mounted outside the
headquarters.
   It was the third week that calls for German reunification
dominated the Monday night Leipzig protests, and the demands were
more pronounced than ever.
   ADN reported 60,000 people rallied in Karl-Marx-Stadt, 10,000 in
Schwerin and tens of thousands in Dresden.
   President Bush indicated at a special session of NATO leaders in
Brussels that a single Germany loyal to NATO would satisfy both the
German yearning for unity and a nation's right to
self-determination, but added later to reporters:
   ``We are not trying to accelerate the process. It's better to
let things move on their own.''
   The Christian Democrats, one of four parties allied with the
Communists, said they were cutting those ties, East German
television reported. It said they demanded that Egon Krenz, who
resigned as Communist Party chief Sunday along with the Politburo,
also give up the largely ceremonial post of president.
   Brigitte Zimmermann, spokeswoman for the party's interim
governing committee, a reform-minded group of 25 people, appealed
for calm to avoid ``anarchy and chaos.''
   ``The committee members have been troubled to learn of
indications of people taking the law into their own hands and
trying to forcefully enter public buildings,'' she said in a
statement read to reporters in East Berlin.
   Flights have been prohibited, as part of the anti-corruption
crackdown, in the area of a huge depot stocked with weapons the
ousted leaders were selling in the Middle East, Africa and Latin
America.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a ranking former official who ran
the weapons operation, has fled the country. The government said
late Monday it was enlisting its embassies in an international
search for him.
   Officials in West Berlin said Schalck-Golodkowski might be there.
   In the first official cooperation between the government and
opposition, a joint commission was formed to investigate corruption
under Erich Honecker, who led the Communist Party for 18 years
until Krenz replaced him in October.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer promised the joint
commission would root out all cases of ``corruption and misuse of
office.'''
   Two former members of the Politburo have been imprisoned as a
result of anti-corruption investigations and 12 former leaders have
been expelled from the party.
   Opposition members urged citizens during a news conference
Monday to ``block coverup attempts and illegal removals'' of
documents and other items. Lothar Scharsich, spokesman for the
opposition group New Forum, also pleaded for ``no violence.''
   In Bonn, the chief aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany said the East German party was ``incapable of acting'' and
had ``totally lost the trust of its supporters, its members and the
people.''
   Rudolf Seiters has been negotiating with with East German
leaders on financial aid, in exchange for which West Germany
demands free elections and economic reform, and laying the
groundwork for a visit by Kohl to East Germany.

   Idealistic military officers who are
among the nation's most talented have tried repeatedly to depose
the president they helped elevate to power in February 1986.
   They organized the Reform The Armed Forces Movement in 1985 to
oppose corruption in the military under the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, who was driven into exile and replaced by Corazon
Aquino.
   Of six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino, they are known to have
plotted those in November 1986, August 1987 and the past weekend.
   The ``RAM Boys,'' as they are known here, have come to believe
her administration represents the same nepotism, and corruption as
the Marcos government.
   On Saturday, they issued a manifesto demanding that Mrs. Aquino
resign to open the way for a referendum on what form the
archipelago's government should take.
   It accused her of pursuing the ruinous policies of her
predecessors and of not initiating social and economic reform. The
RAM officers have claimed Mrs. Aquino favors leftists and coddles
Communist rebels while ignoring the interests of the armed forces.
   RAM emerged when officers unfurled a banner during graduation
exercises at the Philippine Military Academy saying ``We Belong.''
They were described as ``Born Again Soldiers,'' committed to
restoring discipline and professionalism.
   Members include some of the best officers, including former Lt.
Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a charismatic figure who led the
coup attempt in August 1987 and is believed to be a leader of this
one.
   Their political philosophy seems not unlike that of Italian
fascists in the 1920s: Society should exchange hurly-burly politics
for an orderly, disciplined approach to solving national problems.
   Mrs. Aquino prefers consultation and public debate that produces
a consensus she can accept. She tends to rely heavily on people
whose primary qualification is loyalty to her or her husband,
Benigno Aquino Jr., who was shot to death when he returned from
self-imposed exile in the United States.
   Robert Lee, a young RAM lieutenant, appeared on a commandeered
television station during the August 1987 coup attempt to proclaim
his movement's goals. He said Philippine society suffered from
``too much politics'' _ endless debate without resolution.
   The RAM clique became associated with Juan Ponce Enrile, then
defense minister, because of mutual opposition to Gen. Fabian Ver,
military chief of staff to Marcos.
   Ver, a distant relative of Marcos, had circumvented the chain of
command by his relationship with the president and his wife,
Imelda, and underminded Enrile's position as defense chief.
   He had solidified his power by appointing supporters to senior
commands, regardless of merit, so RAM officers looked to Enrile.
   In 1985, as the Marcos administration weakened, RAM officers
began plotting to replace his government with a junta that would
impose discipline and order on a chaotic society.
   RAM sources say they planned a coup for late 1985, but delayed
it after Marcos called a presidential election for February 1986.
   When Marcos used fraud to steal the election from Mrs. Aquino,
RAM issued a statement saying the ``will of the people'' had been
foiled.
   Plans were made for a coup, in which soldiers in rubber boats
would cross the Pasig River and storm the presidential palace, but
Ver learned of the plot and ordered Enrile and others arrested.
   The defense minister found out and withdrew to military
headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo with his ``boys'' and declared
opposition to Marcos.
   His declaration did not win over enough units to assure success,
so Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, then deputy chief of staff,
appealed to Cardinal Jaime Sin and opposition groups.
   Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the cardinal's call to
fill the streets and protect the mutineers. The price was a
declaration from the military leaders of support for Mrs. Aquino.
   Members of RAM always have felt they were denied power that was
rightfully theirs. They risked careers, families and lives to oust
Marcos, but Mrs. Aquino and her advisers, many of them
anti-military, got the rewards.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Study Reveals Inconsistency In FAA Exemptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has granted hundreds of
airline pilots medical exemptions to fly but has not used similar
exemptions to allow pilots to fly past the mandatory retirement age
of 60, a congressional study released Monday said.
   Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., who released the General
Accounting Office study, said the study reveals an inconsistency in
Federal Aviation Administration rules that he said have kept some
of the most qualified and experienced pilots from operating large
commercial airliners.
   The report says the FAA granted 1,301 exemptions to requirements
for medical certificates 1960 through 1988. It said that among the
40,000 active air transport pilots, 605 now have ``special
issuance'' medical certificates for alcoholism and 104 for
cardiovascular conditions.
   ``Allowing such pilots to continue flying, but excluding a
60-year-old pilot in perfect health, clearly does not make sense,''
said Roybal, the chairman of the House Committee on Aging.
   The report said none of 67 petitions by 418 pilots asking for
exemptions for pilots over 60 has been granted by the FAA, which
has said it adopted the rule for safety. Some of the applications
are still pending.
   Pilots over 60 can fly commercial jets with fewer than 30
passengers and a payload under 7,500 pounds but must retire as
captains or copilots of large airliners.
   Roybal said the FAA should reconsider the basis for its age-60
rule, which went into effect in 1959 and has been challenged by
pilot groups and others over the years.
   The report by the GAO, which is Congress' investigative arm,
summarized legal challenges to the rule, legislative efforts and
the position of the FAA and pilots but made no recommendation.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, representing pilots, earlier
opposed the rule but since 1980 has backed the FAA position, saying
there has been no study that provides a way of determining which
pilots over 60 are fit to fly safely.
   Opponents of the rule include the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association and the National Business Aircraft Association.

   More than 150,000 demonstrators
chanting ``They must go!'' rejected the new Communist-dominated
government Monday and demanded free elections in a roaring show of
support for the opposition.
   Also on Monday, thousands of tourists from Czechoslovakia freely
visited the West for the first time in decades after the government
lifted most travel restrictions.
   Demonstrators massed in central Wenceslas Square for the first
time since Nov. 27, when a nationwide general strike forced the
government to grant historic concessions. That demonstration capped
11 straight days of rallies in Czechoslovakia.
   Monday's demonstrators waved red, white and blue national flags
and applauded opposition demands for elections by July and a second
general strike on Dec. 11 if there is no new government by Sunday.
   ``Resign! Resign!'' they chanted.
   The turnout at the rally and smaller ones elsewhere was a clear
signal to the government that the opposition has massive popular
support for its demands for real democracy.
   They were protesting the new coalition government named Sunday,
which brought only five non-Communists into the 21-member Cabinet
and left Communists in control of all key ministries. Thirteen were
holdovers from the previous Communist Cabinet.
   In an indication the government may respond to demands for new
ministers, First Deputy Premier Bohumil Urban met with two
opposition representatives to negotiate a new meeting with
Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec later this week.
   Frantisek Pitra, the premier of the Czech republican government,
asked for more time to consider changes at the republic level,
postponing an announcement originally scheduled for Monday night.
   The governments of the Czech and Slovak republics control key
areas such as justice and education in their respective regions.
   Eleven of the 17 ministers under Pitra in the Czech republic
have submitted their resignations, including the unpopular
ministers of education and justice, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   A parliamentary commission reported on its investigation into
police brutality against student demonstrators on Nov. 17. It
concluded that police used inappropriate force and seriously
injured peaceful demonstrators. It said some police on duty then
may face charges of assault and abuse of office.
   According to CTK, the report blamed ``high political figures''
for the repression, which ``was one of the decisive reasons'' for
subsequent mass protests. CTK listed no names.
   The hourlong Prague rally, broadcast live on state radio and
television, was a triumphant show of national unity in the fight
for democracy. That unity was symbolized at the end, when protest
singer Karel Kryl, who has lived in exile in the West for years,
and Karel Gott, the nation's best-known officially sanctioned pop
singer, led the singing of the national anthem.
   The people loudly cheered Civic Forum spokesman Vaclav Maly when
he announced that the opposition hoped to field its own candidates
in elections.
   ``Thanks for your help and support!'' Maly shouted. ``We need it
now more than ever.''
   ``That's it! That's it!'' the crowd chanted back in a roaring
show of support for Civic Forum, the nation's leading opposition
movement, and its counterpart in Slovakia, called Public Against
Violence.
   Adamec has promised ``radical changes'' with the new government
but has given no specific pledge of free elections, which top
Communists said last week were likely within a year.
   Igor Pleskot, a spokesman for workers' strike committees, told
the Prague rally official trade unions had lost the trust of
people, and said it was time to set up independent ones.
   At least 50,000 people rallied in the Slovak capital Bratislava
to express anger with the new government.
   No rally had been planned in Bratislava, ``but the government
sent us this irritation,'' actor Milan Knazko, a key figure in the
popular uprising against Communist rule, told the crowd.
   CTK also reported protest rallies in the Bohemian city of Usti
nad Labem to the north, Gottwaldov to the east and Ostrova on the
Polish border.
   The Prague rally was the first in the capital since Civic Forum
staged a hugely successful general strike on Nov. 27. TV news said
Monday almost 75 percent of the work force observed the two-hour
stoppage or showed solidarity with it.
   On Nov. 28, Adamec agreed to relinquish the Communist Party's
41-year monopoly on power and form a coalition government.
   The party's leading role in society was removed from the
constitution by a unanimous Parliament last Wednesday. But the new
government named Sunday disappointed those who wanted the
Communists to surrender more control.
   ``We feel disappointed and cheated,'' said Michal Sedlacek, a
representative of striking students.
   The tens of thousands of students on strike nationwide decided
Monday to prolong their two-week sit-in to protest the new
government. Artists, theaters and galleries planned to strike until
Dec. 11.
   ``The government doesn't understand the situation fully,''
Sedlacek told the cheering crowd at Wenceslas Square. ``We want
other changes.''
   Civic Forum's Ladislav Lis demanded the truth about the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed reform in Czechoslovakia, and
demanded the names of the leaders who asked the troops in.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact
nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 condemned that action
Monday.
   Lis demanded that ousted Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and
other hard-liners associated with the post-1968 crackdown surrender
their last political functions as parliamentary deputies.
   ``They must go! They must go!'' the crowd intoned.

<TEXT>
   Alice Sessions, wife of FBI Director
William Sessions, has resigned as head of a highly touted Texas
anti-drug program in a dispute over its fund-raising and spending
practices.
   Ms. Sessions said her abrupt departure from the ``Join the
Move'' project a month ago also followed complaints that telephone
solicitors had used the FBI chief's name to court donations.
   ``I just couldn't be associated with that,'' she told the Austin
American-Statesman. ``I didn't get real accountability from them.
So I got out.''
   Officials of the program, sponsored by the Austin-based Texas
Department of Public Safety Officers' Association (DPSOA), said
there was no wrongdoing.
   ``She may have some particular disagreements with some of the
things that the association is doing, but I think overall our goals
are positive,'' said DPSOA Executive Director Lane Denton.
   The DPSOA was targeted four months ago in a controversy over
phone fund raising by police groups. State Rep. Keith Oakley, an
advocate of tighter restrictions on phone solicitors, said Ms.
Sessions' complaints will rekindle the issue.
   Ms. Sessions expressed concern over fund-raising tactics by the
DPSOA, which hired an Arizona firm to sell boxes of spices, jellies
and sauces, with a portion of the royalties to go to ``Join the
Move.''
   ``I said from the very first that I didn't think that selling
spices was the way to raise money for an anti-drug program,'' Ms.
Sessions said.
   She also raised questions about how wisely the proceeds were
being spent.
   Denton said he was unaware of any problem. Spending is closely
monitored by DPSOA officials, he said.
   Ms. Sessions also said friends complained that they had been
asked for donations for the anti-drug project by callers who
mentioned that she was the wife of the FBI director.
   ``From the very beginning ... I asked that they not do anything
like that _ my husband's position was not to be exploited,'' she
said. One of those who got a sales call was the Sessions' son, who
lives in Texas, she said.
   Denton said DPSOA closely monitors its phone solicitations, and
that callers were instructed not to mention the FBI or say the food
products were endorsed by Ms. Sessions.

   Security considerations convinced the
government not to investigate and try two prominent Palestinians
identified as uprising leaders by an Israeli legislator and court
documents, officials said Monday.
   Tzahi Hanegbi, the legislator, alleged in a Supreme Court appeal
that philosophy professor Sari Nusseibeh and the head of the Arab
Journalists Association, Radwan Abu Ayyash, handled uprising funds
and wrote leaflets urging escalation of the 2-year-old rebellion.
   Hanegbi, of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud
bloc, quoted documents submitted to a military court at Lod in May
that called Nusseibeh a paymaster of the uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, responsible for distributing PLO funds
and publishing uprising literature.
   He claimed Abu Ayyash represented Fatah, the guerrilla group of
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinie Liberation Organization chief, in the
underground Unified National Leadership of the Uprising and was
responsible for several leaflets, army radio reported.
   Neither has been charged and Hanegbi demanded both men be tried,
the national news agency Itim reported.
   Nili Arad of the state attorney's office attributed the decision
not to investigate Nusseibeh and Abu Ayyash to ``professional
considerations,'' Itim and the radio reported.
   She said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Police Minister Chaim
Bar-Lev and other officials bore those considerations in mind,
according to the reports.
   Army radio said the security reasons remained secret but might
be revealed if the court requested it.
   Abu Ayyash said in a telephone interview: ``I would love to know
and understand what these considerations are, but I'm not involved
directly in these things, so I don't see I should worry.''
   He said Hanegbi's appeal contained ``false and fake
allegations,'' and the journalist declared: ``I think that, if the
legal system in Israel possesses information on security
violations, they won't hesitate to ask us for interrogation. I have
been interrogated many times, whenever they suspect something
against security.''
   Nusseibeh characterized Hanegbi's allegations as ``vague and
circumstantial.'' He denied committing offenses or having knowledge
of what the Israeli considerations were.
   ``Regarding secret security reasons, one is always at a loss
concerning secret files of prosecutors,'' he said. ``One can never
really tell what they have or do not have.
   ``I'm glad ... of not being investigated or put on trial. On the
other hand, I'm also quite prepared to face trial and to put
forward my case and to defend myself using all the legal methods at
my disposal.''
   Some Arab observers have speculated Israel saw the two as
possible candidates in its plan for Palestinians in the territories
to elect delegates to negotiate interim autonomy, and therefore was
hesistant to investigate them.
   Both the West Bank and Gaza were paralyzed Monday by the second
day of a general strike called because of an Israeli army attack on
a Palestinian gang in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   On Friday, Israeli soldiers killed four members of a group
calling itself the Black Panthers. Israel claims the group has
killed 16 Palestinians as alleged informers.
   The number of alleged collaborators slain by other Palestinians
since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, rose to 155 on Monday with
the death of Mabrouka al-Akra in a Gaza Strip hospital. Masked
assailants stabbed the 55-year-old woman to death, according to
Arab reports.
   In Gaza City, at least nine Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded by Israeli troops in the Sheik Radwan neighborhood,
hospital officials said.
   An Arab journalist said protests began after residents learned
Jamal Abdul Atti, 25, committed suicide in a Gaza prison Monday. He
was arrested Oct. 10 on suspicion of trying to run over an Israeli
soldier and a civilian.
   At Mukassed Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem, 17-year-old Hussam
Abu Zant died of a gunshot wound to the eye suffered in a clash
with soldiers Nov. 7 in Nablus, doctors reported.
   His death brought to 625 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the uprising. Forty-three Israelis have died.

   The Soviet Union and four other Warsaw Pact
nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform
movement condemned their action on Monday.
   For the first time, the leaders of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria,
Hungary, East Germany and Poland said jointly that sending in
troops constitituted ``interference in the internal affairs of a
sovereign Czechoslovakia and must be condemned,'' according to a
statement read on TV and carried by the official news agency Tass.
   In a separate statement, the Kremlin called the Soviet-led
invasion ``unfounded'' and ``erroneous.'' It noted that Prague
condemned it earlier.
   The invasion used tanks to crush the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
of Alexander Dubcek, who was ousted as Communist Party leader. In
the past two weeks, Dubcek has re-emerged in the pro-democracy
movement sweeping Czechoslovakia.
   Tass said the Soviet and Czechoslovak governments will begin
talks on possible reduction of Soviet troops still based in
Czechoslovakia.
   The statements came at the end of a Warsaw Pact summit meeting
in Moscow, where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated
the Warsaw Pact and its Western foe, NATO, will someday become
political instead of military alliances.
   Monday's announcements came a day after Gorbachev met President
Bush at Malta.
   For months, following momentous political change in East Europe,
all the signers of Monday's announcement except the Soviets
condemned the invasion of their ally. Romania, still run by
hard-liner Nicolae Ceausescu, was not included in Monday's
statement, but Romania did not take part in the invasion.
   The statement said, ``Interrupting the process of democratic
renewal in Czechoslovakia, these unjustified actions had long-term
negative consequences. History proved that it is extremely
important, even in the most complex international situations, to
use political means for the settling of any problem, to strongly
observe principles of sovereignty, independence and
non-interference in internal affairs in relations between states,
in line with the principles of the Warsaw Pact.''
   The Soviet announcement likened the situation in 1968 to the
current political upheaval in Czechoslovakia, where demonstrations
and a general strike have forced leadership changes. The Soviet
statement called this a natural process of self-reassessment.
   It said the Soviet leadership supported one side in the internal
dispute of 1968 and ``the justification for such an unbalanced,
inadequate approach, an interference in the affairs of a friendly
country, was then viewed in an acute East-West confrontation.''
   ``We share the view of the Presidium of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak
government that the entrance of the armies of five socialist
countries into Czechoslovak territory in 1968 was unfounded, and
that that decision, in the light of all the presently known facts,
was erroneous,'' the Soviet government announcement said.
   The invasion stamped out reforms and restored a Moscow-aligned
government of hard-liners. The late Leonid I. Brezhnev, then the
Soviet leader, cited the Warsaw Pact's ``sacred duty'' to protect
socialism wherever it was threatened.
   Albania quit the alliance to protest the invasion and has
remained isolated.
   Gorbachev also met separately with Czechoslovak Premier Ladislav
Adamec and Communist Party leader Karel Urbanek, Tass said, and
``the question of the terms on which Soviet troops stay in
Czechoslovakia came up for discussion.'' The question was referred
to the two nations' foreign ministries.
   Tass' report implied Soviet readiness to remove some troops,
saying, ``reduction of armed forces and armaments on condition of
maintaining European balance ... is the indispensable guarantee of
stability in Europe.''
   The Tass report on Gorbachev's speech to the Warsaw Pact leaders
indicated he said the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ``can contribute to the strengthening
of European security as political alliances.'' The official summary
pointedly avoided any reference to their status now as military
alliances.
   In a time of momentous political change in Eastern Europe, four
of the seven Warsaw Pact nations have replaced staunch Communists
with more reform-minded leaders this year, including non-communist
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. On Monday, more than
150,000 people rallied in Prague Monday to demand the resignation
of Czechoslovakia's government.
   Further meetings at the Kremlin Monday and Tuesday indicate more
developments may be in the offing.
   Gorbachev met Monday with Ceausescu, Romania's Stalinist leader
and the only East European leader to resist the wave of reform
sweeping the Communist bloc. Tass said they had a frank exchange
regarding socialist construction.
   Gorbachev also met with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow
on Monday and was expected to meet Tuesday with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to discuss Soviet resistance to
calls for possible reunification of the two Germanys.
   Tass said Gorbachev told Modrow the Soviets see East Germany as
an important guarantor of peace and stability in Eastern Europe.
   East Germany's longtime leader, Erich Honecker, was ousted Oct.
18 after thousands of citizens fled West and others staged mass
protests for reforms. Egon Krenz replaced Honecker but was forced
on Sunday to resign as Communist Party leader, though he remains
president.
   Petar Mladenov replaced ousted Bulgarian party chief Todor
Zhivkov on Nov. 10, and Karel Urbanek replaced Czechoslovak leader
Milos Jakes on Nov. 24 after pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Tass said Genscher met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze Monday.

   Alexander Dubcek, ousted in disgrace as
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader after the Soviet-led
invasion in 1968, praised his countrymen's struggle for democracy
and said, ``You cannot suppress an idea.''
   Independent Television News broadcast on Monday an interview
with Dubcek in Bratislava. The 67-year-old leader of the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms said, ``An idea is going to survive within
people's conscience.''
   He spoke of the 17 years he lived in forced obscurity after
being removed from office in 1969 and stripped of party membership
in 1970.
   ``They wanted to totally isolate me. I was followed
everywhere,'' he said. ``I had to keep my circle of friends small
to protect them. Maybe they thought I couldn't take it
psychologically but I could. It's been a hard life but we are still
here.''
   Dubcek was relegated to work as a minor forestry official in the
Slovak capital of Bratislava and barred from travel. The
restrictions were relaxed after Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev visited Czechoslovakia in April 1987.
   Reforms instituted by Gorbachev in the Soviet Union have surged
like a tidal wave through the East bloc and on Nov. 24
Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist government resigned under
public pressure. Tens of thousands of people cheered Dubcek in
Prague's Wenceslas Square on his triumphant return to the capital.
   ``To speak in Prague gave me a deep sense of satisfaction,'' he
said Monday. ``Twenty years ago their parents cheered me. Now these
children are doing the same and supporting the same ideas.''
   He said many of the democratic reforms being demanded now were
part of his 1968 plans.
   ``There was no internal power willing to stop the `Prague
Spring,' we were suppressed by external force,'' he said, speaking
through an interpreter. ``The basic idea is the same now. You
cannot suppress an idea. An idea is going to survive within
people's conscience.''
   Thousands of Czechoslovaks demonstrated Monday, protesting the
composition of the new Communist-dominated government.
   Dubcek was asked if he might become president and he said, ``For
the presidency it's up to the people to decide.''
   Dubcek received virtually complete vindication Monday when a
Warsaw Pact summit meeting in Moscow condemned the 1968 invasion as
``interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign''
Czechoslovakia.

   President Bush said Monday it's too
early to proclaim an end to the Cold War, but added that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's acceptance of sweeping reform in Eastern Europe
``absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West.
   Wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at NATO
Headquarters, Bush also told reporters the United States would
maintain ``significant military forces in Europe as long as our
allies desire our presence.''
   The president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in
superpowers conventional forces in Europe ``in the bank'' before
seeking deeper reductions. He told NATO leaders he hoped a
multinational summit could be convened in Europe next summer to
sign such an accord.
   Conventional forces aside, the United States and Soviet Union
are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear
weapons, as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons.
   Bush was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey
that took him to last weekend's summit with Gorbachev.
   Asked if it hadn't been risky to venture out in a small boat in
the storm-tossed harbor in Malta during the weekend, he replied,
``Hot dogging?... No. You know these charismatic, macho, visionary
guys. They'll do anything.''
   He arrived at the White House in Washington by helicopter from
Andrews Air Force Base to be greeted on the South Lawn by his wife
Barbara, who got a kiss, and dog Millie, who got a pat. The
president waved to a small welcoming crowd and headed inside
without speaking.
   The president spoke as Gorbachev was convening a meeting of a
radically reordered Warsaw Pact in Moscow to review the weekend
summit.
   The dramatic change in Europe continued uninterrupted during the
day, as the Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact nations
condemned their own invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. In Leipzig,
East Germany, about 200,000 demonstrators broke into wild rounds of
applause as speakers called for German reunification.
   Bush and Gorbachev leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news
conference before leaving Malta that their meeting heralded a new
era of cooperation in East-West relations, including arms control
and trade. They intend to meet again in the United States in the
second half of June.
   At his news conference, Bush said, ``We stand at the threshold
of a new era...'' but declined to assert the Cold War has ended as
Gorbachev suggested.
   ``That day hasn't arrived,'' the president said when asked about
Gorbachev's statement declaring an end to the ``epoch of the Cold
War.''
   Barring a utopian development, Bush said, ``the United States
must stay involved'' by keeping troops massed against Warsaw Pact
forces.
   ``If you want to project out 100 years, or take some years off
of that, you can look to a utopian day when there might be none
(U.S. troops in Europe),'' he said. ``But as I pointed out to them
(NATO leaders), that day hasn't arrived _ and they agree with me.''
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said he was impressed by the
United States' ``extraordinarily positive attitude'' toward events
in Europe.
   ``It has nothing to do with a `we are pulling out' attitude,''
he told reporters. ``On the contrary, they are again promising a
meaningful presence (in Europe).''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush's speech
``was so full of meat that we really should consider it very
carefully before we reply to it.'' She has urged a more cautious
attitude than some allies toward events unfolding in Eastern Europe.
   The president began his news conference with a statement that
said a ``peaceful revolution'' was taking place in Eastern Europe,
where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks.
   He said his goal was to see ``individual freedom everywhere
replace coercion and tyranny.''
   Bush, apparently referring to disagreements about Central
America, said ``all was not sweetness and light'' at the Malta
summit, but took pains to applaud Gorbachev's handling of the
change in Eastern Europe.
   ``As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has handled the
changes in Eastern Europe, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely
mandates new thinking,'' he said.
   Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said ``I think he took
my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable
about our common objectives.''
   He said Gorbachev was ``determined and unemotional '' in their
private talks. The Soviet leader ``seemed very much in control''
and ``very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of
subjects with me.''
   Bush said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional
forces than are being considered in the Vienna talks. But he said
they viewed ``the rapidity of change differently than we do.''
   And yet Bush registered a renewed personal determination to
realize completion of the treaty next year between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact that would cut U.S. troops by 30,000 and the Soviets by
325,000, to an equal level of 275,000.
   The two alliances' armories of tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme
to reduce tensions from the Atlantic Ocean across the vast expanse
of Europe to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   ``Let's get it done,'' Bush said. He told reporters, ``I, as
president of the United States, will kick the bureaucracy to get it
done.''
   Negotiators working on the accord in the Austrian capital are
making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved, most
significantly a dispute over the kind of Soviet airplanes to be
scrapped.
   In addition, Bush said he was hopeful the West could take steps
to ease Soviet economic woes. ``We want to try to meet him on some
of the areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions
I had in the economic area,'' he said.
   ``But I also believe that the West must remain strong and
together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way, but
not be imprudent,'' he said.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van der Broek said Bush reported to
the NATO leaders that Gorbachev had accepted the multi-nation
summit proposal for next year.
   ``The importance of this is that it indicates both (Bush and
Gorbachev) want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next
year,'' the Dutch official told reporters.
   Also at the NATO session Bush outlined his policy on German
reunification. It rejected a timetable, even though U.S. Ambassador
Vernon A. Walters on Sunday had predicted a merger of East and West
Germany within five years.
   Bush said he favored a step by step approach that also
maintained West German membership in NATO and said, ``I am not
trying to accelerate that process.''
   Even so, officials announced that Bush was sending Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to Germany next week for a symbolic visit
to the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the Cold War that has been opened
to free travel.

<HEAD>PLO Efforts to Upgrade its U.N. Status Collapse</HEAD>

   The PLO's campaign to win recognition in
the General Assembly as the provisional government of Palestine
broke down Monday and negotiations shifted to finding a face-saving
retreat, diplomats said.
   They attributed the failure to upgrade the PLO to
observer-nation status in the General Assembly to shallow support,
divisions within the Palestine Liberation Organization and a U.S.
threat to stop contributing to the United Nations.
   A vote on the resolution was postponed until Wednesday.
   ``The climate is not right now,'' said a senior Palestinian
diplomat, speaking privately. He said the PLO might try to revive
the idea next year.
   The PLO is recognized by the United Nations as an observer
organization. It was seeking to gain recognition as a non-voting
observer state, such as North and South Korea, Switzerland, San
Marino, Monaco and the Vatican.
   Washington said it would cut off all U.S. funds for the United
Nations if the PLO's status was upgraded. The United States is
assessed $216 million annually, one-fourth of the U.N. budget.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said a rift had developed between PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat, at the organization's headquarters in Tunisia, and Farouk
Khaddoumi, the PLO foreign secretary who heads the group's U.N.
delegation.
   Khaddoumi was ``the guiding force'' behind the General Assembly
resolution to upgrade the PLO's status, while Arafat believed the
effort was counterproductive and last week ordered a halt, the
diplomat said.
   European and U.S. diplomats worked with Arab and non-aligned
movement officials through the weekend to avoid a showdown.
   Negotiations on a discrete way for the PLO and Arab group to
postpone consideration of the resolution were not complete when the
time arrived Monday afternoon for a vote and formal action was
deferred until Wednesday.
   The diplomatic sources said the resolution will be suspended
Wednesday.
   As a member of the 102-member non-aligned movement, the PLO
supposedly had enough support to prevail on a simple majority vote
in the 159-member General Assembly.
   But Western diplomats said the vote could have been very close
because many non-aligned Nations did not feel the issue was worth
losing U.S. funds.
   Egypt and Morocco in the Arab group did not support the
resolution and the Soviet Union and its allies also were opposed.
   The resolution draft states the PLO ``has the powers and
responsibilities of the Provisional Government of the State of
Palestine'' and ``shall be construed, within the United Nations, as
the State of Palestine.''
   Last year, the PLO declared the existence of a state of
Palestine without specifying exact borders in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip and has said more than 80 nations formally
recognized the state.
   The United States and many Western governments have not
recognized the move, saying the declared state lacks the basic
attributes of a state, such as a functioning government and
defensible boundaries.

   Warsaw Pact leaders met Monday amid rapid,
bewildering political change in Eastern Europe and uncertainty
about the 34-year-old military alliance's role and unity.
   At Monday's session, the Soviet Union and Pact members Bulgaria,
Hungary, East Germany and Poland condemned their own action in
invading Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform movement.
   The Soviet news agency Tass also said the Kremlin and Prague
will begin talks on possible reduction of Soviet troops still based
in Czechoslovakia.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated at the meeting
that the Warsaw Pact and its Western opponent, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, will someday become political rather than
military alliances.
   For leaders of four of the seven nations, it was their first
meeting, underscoring how quickly old guard Communists have been
swept from power. They heard Gorbachev report on his Malta summit
with President Bush.
   Erstwhile diplomatic cover for the Kremlin's ideological
policing of its allies, the seven-member pact faces unprecedented
pluralism, from its first non-Communist head of government, Polish
Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki, to Romania's hard-line Communist leader
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Somehow, those men must agree on Eastern Europe's future and
defense policy if the Warsaw Pact is to be an alliance in anything
but name. Chastened by past interventions in their countries'
lives, some reformers now in power also want guarantees that the
pact's armed might will not be turned on them.
   Having already ceased to make ideological demands on its allies,
the Warsaw Pact should ``stay out'' of member nations' politics
altogether, said Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary, where
legal groundwork was laid this fall for democratic, multiparty
elections.
   Horn's fears are not baseless: In mid-August, the Romanians
reportedly requested joint Warsaw Pact action against Poland to
preserve Communist Party rule.
   In fact, under Gorbachev, the Soviets appear ready to accept
virtually any sort of political change in Eastern Europe, provided
allegiance is unshaken to the defense treaty written in 1955 at a
time of tight, sometimes violent Kremlin domination.
   ``All the reforms which no one could have imagined a few years
ago will be accepted in Moscow, unless they lead to the questioning
of membership in the Warsaw Pact,'' the Polish newspaper Zycie
Warszawy commented recently.
   Intriguingly, recent Soviet pronouncements indicate the Kremlin
envisons the pact's future in a blurring of functions with the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or COMECON, the notoriously
ineffective socialist trade bloc that includes all Warsaw Pact
members.
   In October, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
the Kremlin would be interested in negotiating the abolition of
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact by the year 2000, as part of the
Kremlin campaign to create a ``common European home.'' But later,
in an interview with the official Polish news agency PAP,
Shevardnadze noted:
   ``For the time being, the two alliances do exist and one should
aim for their gradually being transformed into political-military
organizations through developing civilian trends of their activity
with a simultaneous reduction of all military elements.''
   What East bloc military leaders, traditionally subservient to
their parties, think of such notions is unknown, but Warsaw Pact
defense ministers sounded an apparent note of discord at a meeting
in Hungary on Nov. 27-29 by highlighting the NATO ``threat.''
   ``The military budgets and long-term development programs of the
armed forces of the United States and other NATO countries still
aim to preserve military might as the chief tool of attaining their
foreign policy objectives,'' the ministers said in a communique.
   According to NATO figures, the Warsaw Pact has 3 million
full-time military personnel, compared with 2.2 million for the
Western alliance. Pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity:
3.6 million for NATO and 3.5 million for the East bloc.
   The ``Agreement on Friendship, Coordination and Mutual
Assistance'' was signed May 14, 1955, in Warsaw by the Soviet
Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,
Poland and Romania. The treaty was in effect a response to the
admission of West Germany to NATO 10 days earlier.
   The pact provided the machinery by which the Soviets could
control the Eastern European military, transmit foreign policy
guidelines to their satellites and exercise political control
throughout the ``cordon sanitaire'' to their west.
   The treaty was used as a legal screen for military interventions
now condemned by Eastern Europe's reform governments. In 1956,
revolt broke out in Hungary when the government demanded the
withdrawal of Soviet troops and stated its intention to leave the
pact to become a neutral country. Soviets troops crushed the revolt
and installed a new leadership.
   Alexander Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia
also were snuffed out when Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks invaded in
1968 to restore a Moscow-aligned government. Soviet leader Leonid
I. Brezhnev said the alliance had the ``sacred duty'' to protect
socialism wherever it was threatened.
   That assertion, which became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, has
been repudiated by Gorbachev. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov jocularly noted the Kremlin now practices ``the Sinatra
Doctrine,'' named for Frank Sinatra's trademark song ``My Way,'' by
letting each of its allies do things ``its way.''
   Some disagreement with Moscow was allowed in the past. The
Communist hermit state of Albania formally pulled out of the pact
to protest the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1958, Romania
withdrew from its agreement to permit stationing of Soviet troops
on its soil, and ceased to take part in Warsaw Pact military
exercises.
   Moscow's allies also balked when the Soviets, in 1956-7 and
1967-8, tried to form a standing Warsaw Pact army. They feared
their troops might be deployed to support purely Soviet adventures,
for example on the Chinese border.
   Nevertheless, 34 years after its creation, the Warsaw Pact's
machinery remains dominated at all levels by Soviets. In February,
Gen. Pyotr Lushev, a first deputy defense minister, replaced
another Soviet, Marshal Viktor Kulikov, as alliance commander.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh disclosed
Monday that he had ordered a preliminary inquiry to determine
whether a special prosecutor should investigate alleged criminal
wrongdoing by former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said a letter to
Congress delivered earlier in the day informed lawmakers of the
action.
   Thornburgh ordered the inquiry in response to a request by 19
House Democrats that he appoint a special prosecutor, formally
known as an independent counsel, to investigate allegations of
criminal wrongdoing by Pierce when he ran the scandal-plagued
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Runkel said the preliminary inquiry, which the department has 60
days to complete, started on Saturday.
   A lawyer for Pierce, Robert Plotkin, dismissed the move as
insignificant, saying he was confident it would not result in
appointment of an independent counsel.
   ``Under the very low threshhold the statute requires, we aren't
surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken,'' Plotkin
said. ``We are confident that at the end of the 90-day period they
will find there is no basis for appointing an independent counsel.''
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., one of two members who led the
call for an independent counsel, said he was ``pleased that we are
finally moving in the right direction of exploring the criminal
side of the HUD scandal.''
   ``I hope that if a special prosecutor is ultimately ordered that
the attorney general will ask for broad jurisdiction so that the
prosecution, if any, at the highest levels of HUD are all
coordinated,'' Morrison said. ``There is enough here that justifies
a careful look by an independent counsel.''
   Lawmakers suggested there was evidence of a conspiracy by Pierce
and other top officials at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to defraud federal urban aid programs by awarding
grants on the basis of political favoritism.
   The congressmen, all members of the House Judiciary Committee,
had also suggested in their Nov. 2 letter that Pierce had lied to
the House Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee
when he testified last spring.
   The lawmakers cited Pierce's testimony that he was did not have
a ``hands on'' involvement in dispensing HUD grants to private
developers.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who with Morrison led the call for
an independent counsel, said Thornburgh's decision ``is a move that
should be welcomed by everyone, including ex-Secretary Pierce..
   ``This investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers
to questions that are not going away,'' Schumer said. He said he
was convinced that an independent counsel ``is the best and perhaps
only way that all answers about the scandal will come out.''
   Under the independent counsel law, Thornburgh was required to
decide within 15 days of receiving the lawmakers' Nov. 2 letter
whether to proceed with a preliminary inquiry. The law gave him
another 15 days to report that decision to Congress.
   Independent counsels are appointed by a special federal court
that reviews applications submitted by the Justice Department.
   After receiving their request last month, Thornburgh pointedly
accused of of the lawmakers of trying to inject ``partisan politics
into this matter, which has until now been handled on a
non-partisan, professinal way by the Congress, HUD and this
department.''
   ``Even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations
have been completed,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh's comments were directed at Schumer and Morrison.
   In a session with reporters last week, Thornburgh bristled at
the suggestion that the Justice Department was not aggressively
pursuing an investigation of Pierce because the two men sat
together in President Reagan's Cabinet.
   ``Let me tell this, in this or any other case, Dick Thornburgh
is going to go where the evidence leads,'' the attorney general
said. ``If the evidence is there, we will take appropropriate
action; if it's not, we won't.''
   Morrison suggested that Thornburgh would not have ordered with
preliminary inquiry without the request from the lawmakers, saying,
``There is no indication that it wouldn't have happened without our
initiative.''

<HEAD>Commander Zero Claims Opposition Did Not Want Him Back</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eden Pastora, a former Sandinista hero
who switched sides and fought with the Contras, said Monday that
opposition groups in Nicaragua did not want him to return from
exile.
   Pastora, also know as Commander Zero, is a former Sandinista
vice minister of defense who fought with the Contras from 1983-86
and then retired to private life. He returned Sunday to support the
Social Christian Party.
   Repeating what he said at a rally immediately after his arrival,
Pastora called the Social Christians an alternative to the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front and the U.S.-backed National
Opposition Union, known as UNO, in the Feb. 25 national elections.
   The Social Christian Party and its presidential candidate Erick
Ramirez persuaded Pastora to return to Nicaragua and support them.
Few believe Pastora can add many more followers to the Social
Christians.
   The controversy surrounding Commander Zero already has attracted
the kind of news media attention the Social Christians, a minority
party, had sought unsuccessfully. About 25 journalists crowded a
small conference room Monday morning at party headquarters, but
ignored Ramirez, who sat next to Pastora.
   Many questions revolved around Pastora's past.
   Pastora said that he had spoken with some UNO members. ``They
left me with the impression that they did not want me to return to
Nicaragua.''
   ``Sectors of the CIA in alliance with the Contras'' were
responsible for the bombing at his southern Nicaragua jungle
hideout in 1984, where four journalists were killed, he said.
Pastora alleged that the attempt was made ``because I never wanted
to accept anti-popular postures'' adopted by the Contras. He did
not elaborate.
   Pastora said he intends to settle in Nicaragua if he can
continue the fishing business he runs in neighboring Costa Rica.
   Commander Zero, as he is still known, gained world attention
Aug. 20, 1978, when he led 20 Sandinista rebels in a takeover of
the National Palace.
   The rebels held dozens of legislators hostage and succeeded in
freeing from prison 50 Sandinista leaders, among them Daniel Ortega
and Tomas Borge, who are now president and interior minister.
   Eleven months later, the Sandinista came to power in a popular
revolt that forced President Anastasio Somoza to flee.
   After the Sandinista victory in 1979, Pastora became vice
minister of defense and of interior but grew disillusioned with the
Sandinistas and left the country in 1981. It is said he was
embittered when he was denied the post of defense minister, which
went to and is still held by Ortega's brother, Humberto.
   In 1983 Pastora joined the Contras, fighting in the southern
front, but his outspoken criticism and independence soon led him
into strong differences with the Contras. In 1986 he quit fighting
and left for Costa Rica.

<HEAD>GOP Committee Refuses to Tackle Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia's Republican Party emerged from a
weekend meeting with no clearcut policy on abortion, an issue many
GOP members believe cost them the election for governor.
   The Republican State Central Committee refused Sunday to vote on
a resolution stating that there is room for abortion supporters as
well as opponents in the GOP.
   ``This issue has got to come out,'' Don Moseley, a district GOP
chairman, said after the committee voted 40-27 to table his
resolution. ``It has to be settled.''
   Moseley said J. Marshall Coleman, the Republican candidate for
governor, lost the Nov. 7 election to Democrat L. Douglas Wilder
because of the abortion issue.
   Wilder, who will become the nation's first elected black
governor if his narrow election victory withstands a recount,
campaigned in favor of abortion rights. Coleman opposes abortion
except to save the life of the mother.
   Moseley's resolution said state Republicans ``must support any
candidate nominated by the party, regardless of that candidate's
position on the issue of abortion.''
   Hugh Mulligan, the state party's first vice chairman, said the
party already allows differing views on the issues.
   He said debating the resolution would provide ``a catalyst for
the press,'' which he said has tried to portray the party as
divided on the abortion issue.
   Moseley said the party's inaction at its three-day meeting in
Roanoke leaves the impression that the GOP remains captive to
abortion opponents. He said he'd resubmit his resolution when the
committee meets in Richmond Feb. 24.

   State Sen. Joseph Montoya went on
trial Monday on federal corruption charges that could result in a
220-year prison sentence and more than $3 million in fines.
   Montoya, chairman of the Senate's Business and Professions
Committee, refused to answer reporters' questions as he entered the
courthouse accompanied by his wife, Pilar, and two of his daughters.
   As U.S. District Court Judge Milton Schwartz questioned
potential jurors, Montoya sat between his two lawyers at the
defense table and occasionally made notes on a pad.
   Montoya, 50, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte,
has pleaded innocent to a dozen felony counts that accuse him of
bribery, extortion, racketeering and money laundering.
   He faces a maximum penalty of more than $3 million in fines and
220 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
   He is the first person to be tried as a result of the FBI's
4-year-old investigation of alleged corruption at the state
Capitol. He is accused of obtaining or attempting to obtain money
in exchange for votes.
   Among other things, the charges include allegations that Montoya
accepted a $3,000 ``honorarium'' from an undercover agent in
exchange for help in getting a special-interest bill through the
Senate.
   The FBI probe came to light after about 30 federal agents raided
the Capitol on the night of Aug. 24-25, 1988 and searched the
offices of Montoya, three other lawmakers and their aides.
   In their investigation, FBI agents set up dummy companies and
claimed they were seeking legislation to help them set up a shrimp
importing operation in Northern California.
   Charges also have been filed against an Assembly aide, a former
Montoya aide, a former Yolo County sheriff and a former
undersheriff. The aide and the former undersheriff have agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors.
   U.S. Attorney David Levi, who is heading a three-member team
that is prosecuting the case, filed a list of 63 potential
prosecution witnesses, including Gene Upshaw, head of the National
Football League Players' Association; actor Ed Asner; and several
Capitol lobbyists.
   According to a prosecutors' memorandum, in May 1985 Montoya
asked Asner, then president of the Screen Actors Guild, for a
financial contribution in exchange for his support of guild
legislative aims.
   The memorandum also said that Montoya demanded money from the
NFL Players Association in exchange for siding with the association
on legislation dealing with the relationship between professional
athletes and their agents.

   President Bush called Philippines President
Corazon Aquino Monday night to express concern for the lives of
Americans in hotels occupied by rebel soldiers and to pay tribute
to her courage in seeking to quell the rebellion, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush had just completed a 9-hour journey from Brussels, where he
briefed the NATO allies on his weekend summit with Mikhail
Gorbachev, when he called the Philippine leader.
   ``The president tried to call Mrs. Aquino earlier in the day and
was unable to get through. So when we got home tonight ... he went
immediately up to the residence and re-placed the call,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The rebellion broke out Friday before dawn Philippine time, just
before Bush embarked on his journey to Malta.
   Vice President Dan Quayle presided over an all-night meeting of
the National Security Council in the White House, and Bush later
approved overflights by U.S. fighter jets based in the Philippines
to keep rebel aircraft on the ground.
   Despite claims by the Aquino government that it had quashed the
rebellion, fighting continued in Manila for a fifth day Tuesday,
with 2,000 foreign tourists and business people trapped in the
embattled Makati financial district. Some 215 Americans were holed
up at three hotels in the district, according to the U.S. embassy.
   The Aquino government said Tuesday it had arranged bus
transportation to evacuate the foreigners to the airport, and a
rebel spokesman telephoned news agencies to say the foreigners
would be released.
   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded
since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed
the presidential palace Friday.
   Fitzwater quoted Bush as telling Aquino: ```I understand some
Americans are in the hotels. ... Can we get those people out? I'm
very concerned about their lives and their safety.'''
   ``She assured him they were doing everything possible to protect
American lives,'' Fitzwater said. ``Then the president ended the
conversation by saying, `I appreciate your concern for the
civilians. We're proud of you for standing up with great courage.
We want to see you succeed.'''
   Asked if Bush was considering sending in U.S. troops to rescue
the Americans, Fitzwater said, ``We don't think that will be
necessary.''
   He said Bush called Aquino because ``he just wanted to register
his concern for the lives of Americans who were trapped in these
hotels. ... He just wanted to ask that she make every attempt to
protect their lives.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, who had accompanied
Bush on Air Force One on the journey back from Europe, was with the
president as he made the call from his personal quarters.

   State Rep. David Duke, the former Ku Klux
Klan leader who won election to the Louisiana House earlier this
year, announced plans Monday to challenge Sen. J. Bennett Johnston,
D-La.
   ``I think it's time we had a conservative Republican in the U.S.
Senate to represent the true issues and wishes of the people of
Louisiana,'' he said.
   However, Duke, 39, refused to rule out the possibility that he
might challenge U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., instead.
   Duke gave out copies of a letter and petitions calling for
President Bush and Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater to support him against Johnston. Atwater repudiated Duke in
the state legislative race, and Bush endorsed his opponent, fellow
Republican John Treen.
   The letter and petition are being sent to every GOP household in
the state, Duke said.
   Johnston, who has held the seat 18 years, said Duke's entry into
the race will make it more interesting.
   ``Oh, it ups the ante. There will be some national attention
here, and it will make it more fun also,'' Johnston said during a
visit to Shreveport on Monday. The election will be Oct. 6, 1990.
   Duke said he thought his past as imperial wizard of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan would help his candidacy.
   ``I think it says to a lot of people that I will stand up for my
principals and ideals. ... I won't compromise my ideals,'' he said.
   Duke said he has raised $60,000 in cash and $224,000 in pledges
for the Senate campaign.
   He said his platform would be the same as it was in his campaign
for the state House, when he called for eliminating affirmative
action and busing to achieve school desegregation, among other
things.
   Duke said his official announcement probably would be made in
January.

<TEXT>
   The main defendant in
Yugoslavia's largest political trial in decades accused Serbia's
leadership Monday of staging the trial as part of its policy of
repressing ethnic Albanians.
   Azem Vlasi, a former Communist Party chief in Kosovo, told the
court on the first day of his defense that ``the trial represents
the worst possible violation of ... human rights.''
   Vlasi and 14 other ethnic Albanians are accused of engaging in
counterrevolutionary activities and of inciting unrest last winter
in which at least 25 people died.
   At the time, ethnic Albanians, who make up almost 90 percent of
the province's 1.9 million people, were angered by constitutional
amendments that gave Serbia greater control over the affairs of the
province.
   Kosovo is a part of Serbia, the nation's largest republic, and
had previously enjoyed a measure of autonomy.
   Vlasi denied the charge that he was responsible for the deaths,
which occurred during clashes between protesters and security
forces.
   He said his trial was organized by Slobodan Milosevic, the
republic's leader, and Rahman Morina, Kosovo's current party chief.
   District public prosecutor Spasoje Zamfirovic demanded several
times that Vlasi be prevented from giving what he said was a
political speech, but judge Ismet Emra overruled the objections.
   Vlasi denied he had visited a nearby mine, where workers staged
an eight-day sit-in in February to ``incite the strikers,'' as
claimed in the indictment.
   ``I went there exclusively for humane reasons,'' he said, adding
that he had reported his activities to Milosevic and to Morina.
   ``A political trial has been staged on behalf of a policy which
advocated repression in Kosovo so that (the province) may be ruled
through a state of emergency instead of democratic methods,'' Vlasi
said.
   Milosevic led the drive earlier this year for constitutional
amendments he said were necessary to protect Kosovo's Slav minority
from harassment by ethnic Albanians.
   Vlasi, 42, faces the death sentence if found guilty.
   He is being held in the Titova Mitrovica prison during the
trial, which began Oct. 30.
   Vlasi said prison conditions were ``brutal'' but that he would
not be broken. ``I can disappear physically but I will not
submit,'' he said.
   The trial continues Tuesday and Vlasi's defense presentation is
expected to last five days.
   The federal leadership meanwhile said Monday that a clash
between Slovenia and Serbia, two of its constituent republics,
seriously threatens Yugoslav unity.
   The statement from the nation's eight-member state presidency
was carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
   Serbia cut all political and business contacts with Slovenia
last Wednesday after authorities there banned a rally by Serbs.
   The presidency said without elaborating it will take all steps
necessary to solve the worst political crisis in Communist
Yugoslavia's 46 years of existence.
   It said the federation's political situation ``has dangerously
deteriorated'' because of the clash, ``which seriously threatens
Yugoslavia's integrity.''
   The Yugoslav federation consists of six republics and two
autonomous provinces, encompassing varied ethnic groups and
religions. The latest row brought to a head a long series of bitter
disputes between Slovenia and Serbia.
   Slovenia's liberal-oriented leadership advocates regional
autonomy and has legalized opposition parties that are to contest
the first-ever free multiparty elections in post-World War II
Yugoslavia, scheduled for next March.
   Serbia's leadership favors a centralized federation and opposes
Western-style political pluralism.
   Several Serbian firms said Monday they are severing all economic
ties with Slovenian firms and closing down branch offices there.
   Economists say cutting business ties will backfire, since Serbia
is economically much weaker than Slovenia.
   Yugoslavia's political, economic and social problems have
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito,
who founded the modern Yugoslav federation in 1943.

<TEXT>
   The armed forces eased a
dusk-to-dawn curfew Monday, claiming it had 90 percent of El
Salvador under control after a three-week rebel offensive.
   San Salvador, hit hard for the first time in the 10-year-old
civil war, began enjoying a sustained calm over the weekend. The
armed forces press office said the curfew now will be from 11 p.m.
to 6 a.m. instead of 6 p.m to 6 a.m.
   Although an armed forces spokesman said reports of only ``small,
routine'' combat emerged Monday, an ABC news crew said they saw
heavy fighting 25 miles south of the capital in Zacatecoluca.
   A U.S. Embassy source said the guerrillas used two more recently
acquired anti-aircraft missiles. The source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said both missed their targets, O-2 observation
planes.
   The guerrillas used the weapon for the first time last week,
firing two missiles at A-37 jet fighters but missing their mark.
   El Salvador suspended relations with Nicaragua Nov. 26, saying
planes from Nicaragua flew in the missiles.
   Meanwhile, the arraignment of a Connecticut woman accused of
hiding rebel arms was postponed.
   Guillermo Romero Hernandez, the judge of the military tribunal
where Jennifer Jean Casolo was to appear, said he expected strict
new anti-terrorist measures would be applied retroactively,
affecting her case.
   The measures have not yet been signed into law by rightist
President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Ms. Casolo, 28, a native of Thomaston, Conn., and a former
resident of Seattle, worked for an ecumenical group that acted as
liaison for visiting church groups and congressional aides.
   Authorities say they unearthed a huge munitions cache in her
yard Nov. 26, including more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition for
AK-47 assault rifles.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, here to advise Ms.
Casolo, said she does not want to leave, even it if means spending
time in prison.
   He said she will plead innocent when charges are filed.
   The judge said her arraignment was postponed because of
confusion about jurisdiction and procedure.
   Scott Wright, a Roman Catholic lay missionary from San Antonio,
Texas, was freed Monday after spending the weekend in a 10-by-16
foot cell with 15 other people.
   Wright, a slender, soft-spoken Nebraska native, was picked up
Thursday night in a parish house in a San Salvador slum along with
a Spanish priest and three Salvadoran lay workers.
   He said he spent most of the first night and part of the first
day blindfolded and handcuffed, standing against a wall.
   Wright, who has spent three years working among the poor and
those displaced by the war, said police administered a paraffin
test to see if he had fired a gun and accused him of being involved
with the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   He was freed on the condition he leave El Salvador; no charges
were filed.
   Wright said he leaves reluctantly.
   ``Through the years, I've come to know the Salvadoran people,
particularly the poor, and the Salvadoran Church quite well,'' he
said. ``I know what they are living through, what they are
suffering.''
   The FMLN launched an urban offensive Nov. 11 that paralyzed the
capital for more than a week and led to imposition of the curfew.
   The Cristiani government also imposed a state of siege that
suspends many constitutional guarantees, including freedom of the
press and the right of assembly.
   In another development, a summit of Cristiani and four other
Central American presidents was scheduled for Dec. 10-12 in Costa
Rica, sources close to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica said
Monday. The meeting is to deal with relocation of Nicaraguan rebels
from camps in Honduras.

   A fugitive East German trade official
wanted in his country for suspected illegal currency and weapons
deals might be in West Germany, government spokesman Dieter Vogel
said Monday.
   But he said East Germany has not sent a request for the
apprehension of Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski and even if it did it
was uncertain if he could be sent back.
   The East German government said Sunday that Schalck-Golodkowski,
a state secretary in the foreign trade ministry, fled the country
after an investigation was ordered into a secret operation to ship
weapons to the Middle East, Africa and South America.
   It said a warrant was issued Sunday for his arrest and the
government was enlisting its embassies in an international search
for him.
   Vogel said Schalck-Golodkowski and other East German finance
officials were in Bonn last Wednesday holding talks with West
German authorities.
   ``We don't know where he is now,'' Vogel told The Associated
Press.
   He was asked if Schalck-Golodkowski might still be in West
Germany and he said, ``That's something we can't exclude. But we
are not looking for him.''
   Vogel and Juergen Schmid, a Justice Ministry spokesman, said
there were no indications Schalck-Golodkowski has committed any
illegal acts in West Germany.
   Vogel noted there is no extradition treaty between the two
Germanys and said he did not know what could be done if East
Germany asked that the suspect be seized and returned.
   Wolfgang Vogel, East Germany's most prominent lawyer, said
Schalck-Golodkowski had asked that he represent him. He said
Schalck-Golodkowski was ``at an unknown location'' outside East
Germany.
   East Germany's state news agency ADN said Schalck-Golodkowski
had returned to East Berlin after the meeting last week in Bonn and
disappeared during the weekend.
   On Saturday investigators found a secret warehouse in Kavelstorf
that contained weapons to be sold abroad, according to ADN.
   It said foreign exchange proceeds from the sales were paid into
the Foreign Trade Bank of East Germany addressed to
Schalck-Golodkowski.

<HEAD>Eric Purdon, Who Helped Desegregate Navy, Dead At 76</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retired Navy Cmdr. Eric S. Purdon, who
commanded one of the ships that helped integrate blacks into the
Navy's regular ranks, has died of prostate cancer at age 76.
   Purdon died at his home near Annapolis on Saturday.
   Blacks were usually restricted to being mess attendants before
the experiments in desegregation during World War II on ships such
as Purdon's submarine chaser, the PC1264, said Purdon's wife, Mary.
   The PC1264 was commissioned to demonstrate whether blacks could
be capable seamen.
   One of the crewmen on the ship was Samuel Lee Gravely Jr., who
became the first American black admiral.
   After World War II, Purdon was an intelligence analyst for
Central Intelligence Group, the forerunner of the Central
Intelligence Agency, until 1948, when he was recalled to active
duty in the Navy.
   After retiring in 1963, he was a spokesman for the Commerce
Department and the Office for Economic Opportunity and a special
aide to the director of the Job Corps.
   His book, ``Black Company, The Story of Subchaser 1264,''
detailing the mission, was published in 1972.
   He was born in the Philippines, and educated in England and
Ireland. He was a graduate of Trinty College in Hartford, Conn.,
and earned a master's degree from Boston Univeristy.
   He returned to the Philippines, working as a night manager on a
sugar plantation before joining an expedition to Mongolia to
collect stories and legends about Ghenghis Khan and the Mongols of
the 13th century. The material provided background for his first
book, ``The Valley of the Larks.''
   During World War II, he commanded two ships in the Atlantic and
the Caribbean, including the subchaser.
   Purdon also was co-author of ``Battle Report: The Middle
Phase,'' an account of naval operations in the Pacific during the
war. He also wrote articles and short stories.
   Survivors include his wife; two sons, a daughter and one
grandson.

   An environmental coalition plans
an international tribunal on the Union Carbide Corp. chemical leak
in Bhopal, India, that killed more than 3,500 people, the
organizers said Monday.
   The tribunal, which will have no binding powers, will be held
next fall by the International Coalition for Justice in Bhopal, a
group of concerned citizens and environmentalists in Western
Europe, the United States and India, said spokeswoman Ruth Waterman.
   Sunday was the fifth anniversary of the world's worst industrial
accident, in which thousands of people were killed when methyl
isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in
Bhopal, a central Indian city about 360 miles south of New Delhi.
   At least 3,598 people have died from effects of the gas, and
relief workers say victims continue to die at a rate of at least
one a day. Most of the 20,000 survivors suffer from eye and lung
ailments and are unable to work.
   Ms. Waterman said the major purpose of the tribunal will be to
devise an international framework to protect victims of such
catastrophes.
   ``We want to present an outline of international legislation on
fixing liability in such disasters,'' she said.
   Union Carbide gave $470 million to the Indian government in
April in final compensation for the accident, which it claimed was
the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   ``It's a ridiculous amount,'' Ms. Waterman said at a
presentation of the environmental coalition's plans for the
tribunal.
   The Indian government originally had sued the U.S.-based
multinational company for $3 billion, alleging negligence.
   The tribunal is to convene in October and take testimony from
victims in Bhopal. The proceedings are to end in London in
December, Ms. Waterman said.
   She said the composition of the tribunal had not been decided.

   Fifteen Soviet-built jetliners once reserved
for use by top East German Communist officials will be put into
passenger service, the state news agency ADN said Monday.
   Klaus Henkes, general director of the national airline
Interflug, told ADN about half the planes were ready for immediate
use on charter flights and the rest would be converted for
passenger use.
   The jetliners will remain based at army airfields because
civilian East German airports currently do not have enough hangar
space and maintenance capacity, ADN quoted Henkes as saying.
   Use of the previously official fleet of planes will allow
Interflug to sell off noisy, fuel-guzzling older Soviet models and
expand capacity to meet passenger demand in East Germany.
   Henkes said experts estimate the number of East Germans flying
annually will double to 6 million by the year 2000.
   The fleet reserved for East German statesmen included
Soviet-built Tu-134, Tu-154 and Il-62 models, ADN said.

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who fled her
Communist homeland for freedom in the West, arrived here Monday
night and said she would be settling in south Florida.
   Comaneci, 28, escaped from Romania on Tuesday, reportedly
enduring a muddy, 6-hour nighttime trek through rough terrain
before reaching the Hungarian border.
   ``I came here a few years ago and I liked it,'' Comaneci told
the Associated Press after arriving on Pan Am Flight 2077 on the
arm of Constantin Panit of Hallandale, a fellow Romanian exile who
helped her defect.
   Representatives from the State Department greeted them at Miami
International Airport and escorted them to a car waiting to take
them to an undisclosed hotel in Miami.
   The State Department officials told Comaneci that Panit's house
was surrounded by reporters and that Panit's wife, Maria, was upset
by the barrage of news media, before taking them to an undisclosed
hotel in Miami.
   Panit said the two were friends from Romania, but did not
elaborate on their relationship.
   Officials of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation had flown to New
York in hopes of contacting Comaneci and setting up a meeting
between the former Olympic champion and her former coach Bela
Karolyi, who now lives in Houston.
   Comaneci said she would not be involved with the U.S Gymnastics
Federation. She also told the Associated Press she would not be
working with her former coach Bela Karolyi. ``I have no business
with my former coach,'' she said.
   Some news reports said her destination was Indianapolis, Houston
or Orlando, Fla. But Comaneci said had no immediate plans to visit
Disney World and just wanted to relax for a while.
   Comaneci, wearing a grey cashmere sweater, blue jeans and
high-top tennis shoes, was unwilling to discuss anything about her
homeland. ``I don't know what is happening there,'' she said.
   Comaneci had arrived Friday in New York City after fleeing
Romania through Hungary and Austria, and held a brief news
conference but since has kept out of public sight.

   There isn't a messier musical in town than ``Up
Against It,'' an apt title for this chaotic song and dance
adaptation of an unproduced screenplay originally written by Joe
Orton for the Beatles.
   The musical, which opened Monday at the New York Shakespeare
Festival Public Theater, defeats a lot of people _ particularly a
slew of talented performers such as Alison Fraser, Philip Casnoff
and Toni Dibuono, director Kenneth Elliott and Orton himself.
   Only hints of Orton's wicked humor show through in this
flat-footed and tuneless version of his story adapted for the stage
by Tom Ross with music and lyrics by rock star Todd Rundgren.
   Orton, the iconoclastic English playwright who was murdered by
his lover in 1967, apparently fashioned a satiric tale about the
adventures of two British scamps and a subsequent war between the
sexes. In the musical, the battle takes place after a group of
radical men have assassinated the female prime minister. She is
replaced by another, even tougher woman, played with relentless
assurance by the booming Dibuono.
   Ross' scattershot book takes on religion, the rich, right-wing
politicians, sexual stereotyping, the military and all points in
between.
   The low point of the musical occurs when the men dress up as
women to infiltrate a political rally held by the prime minister.
The number is called _ what else _ ``Life Is a Drag'' and it is as
hard to watch as it is to listen to.
   Most of Rundgren's score is a disappointment. Except for a fine
ballad entitled ``Parallel Lines,'' it is remarkably conventional,
blandly at odds with the outrageousness of the story being told on
stage.
   Elliott has directed the show at a furious pace, and Jennifer
Muller's choreography is equally athletic. Nothing stops for very
long, although the musical numbers have a way of numbing the story
line rather than advancing the plot.
   What Orton and the Beatles would have done with ``Up Against
It'' is a tantalizing question. There are hints of such Beatle
movies as ``A Hard Day's Night'' and ``Help!'' in some of the
musical's more frantic posturings. But you would be better off to
rent videos of those classics than sit through ``Up Against It.''

   Rancher Gabriel Raba figures the
present calendar switches around too much on the number of days in
a month, so he's drawn up a new plan where there'd be 28 days each
month _ all 13 of them.
   ``I haven't had hardly anybody that didn't agree with me'' said
Raba, 78. ``But I might not live long enough to see the change.''
   His calendar would be easy to understand and remember, Raba
says. Thirteen 28-day months equals 364 days. Making up for the
365th day is simple. Just create a 48-hour New Year's Day.
   Leap Year every four years also would have an extra 48-hour day,
wiping out the current Feb. 29.
   The current calendar, adopted in 1582, has 12 months with either
28, 29, 30 or 31 days.
   The Raba calendar would mean fixed-date holidays would always be
on the same day of the week. Every month would start on Monday,
which is the first day of Raba's weeks.
   The current names of months and days would remain, but the 13th
month would need a name.
   Raba said he has suggested the calendar to President Bush,
former Gov. Bill Janklow, current Gov. George Mickelson, the United
Nations, Canadian officials and others.
   ``All the answers I got, they thought it made sense and was
good,'' he said. ``But most didn't know if we was quite ready for
it yet. ... They all agreed that we're due for a change somehow.''

   A bank robbery suspect holed up inside a
house Monday wounded a policeman, then threatened suicide an
automatic pointed at his chest before a sharpshooter shot it out of
his hand, ending a nearly three-hour standoff, police said.
   A man and a woman also were arrested in the holdup, spokesman
Foster Arnett said.
   The gunman kept police and FBI agents at bay with random shots
fired from inside the house with a .45-caliber automatic, Arnett
said.
   The man emerged from the house in this eastern Tennessee city
around 2:30 p.m. after police filled it with tear gas, Arnett said.
He then lay down on the porch, pointed his pistol at his chest and
flashed a ``peace'' sign.
   A SWAT team member shot the gun out of the man's hand, and
officers captured him, Arnett said. The man was not seriously
wounded.
   Shots fired from inside the house hit Officer Richard Giammarino
three times in the arm and once in the chest. He was in stable
condition at the University of Tennessee Medical Center, Arnett
said.
   ``His bulletproof vest probably saved his life,'' the spokesman
said.
   The incident began around 9:50 a.m., when the gunman and the
other two suspects were seen fleeing the robbery of a First
Tennessee Bank branch.
   An unidentified motorist followed their car, saw them switch
vehicles, followed them to the house and called authorities, Arnett
said.
   The woman and the other man emerged from the house a short time
later and surrendered, Arnett said.
   All three suspects were being held at the Knoxville police
department. Their identities were withheld pending formal charges,
Arnett said.
   Authorities recovered an unspecified amount of money from the
holdup.

   The life of Polish union activist Lech
Walesa will be documented in a $20 million Warner Bros. movie, the
studio announced Monday.
   The authorized biography of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
Solidarity leader will be produced by James W. Brubaker and Thom
Mount beginning in 1990, Warners and the Mount Co. said in a joint
release.
   Mount acquired the rights to Walesa's story nine months ago from
a group that included director Stanley Kramer.
   Because of Eastern European reforms, the film will be shot in
Poland instead of West Germany as originally planned, according to
the Hollywood Reporter.
   The Reporter also said Hollywood's hottest producers, Columbia
Pictures co-chairmen Jon Peters and Peter Guber, had hoped to make
the picture.

   The Navy outmuscled Greenpeace
anti-nuclear protesters Monday, crippling their vessels and towing
them out of an area where they tried unsuccessfully to halt the
test launch of a Trident 2 missile.
   The high seas drama took place in the Atlantic 50 miles off the
Florida coast just before the nuclear-powered submarine Tennessee
unleashed the $26.5 million missile on a test that put the Trident
2 program back on track after two explosive failures in the first
three undersea launches.
   ``We did a perfect launch, just beuatiful,'' Vice Adm. Roger
Bacon, commander of the Atlantic Submarine Fleet, said at a news
conference.
   The Navy said its ships had to ``shoulder'' aside a large ship
carrying protesters, and capture and tow away two high-speed rafts
called Zodiacs from the launch area.
   Greenpeace USA peace activists said the Navy rammed their ship,
aimed fire hoses down its smoke stacks to stop its engines and that
Navy divers had sliced the fuel lines and punctured the pontoons on
the Zodiacs.
   Bacon said hoses were used and that Navy sailors in rafts cut
the fuel lines on one of the Zodiacs after the other broke down in
heavy seas.
   Three Navy helicopters made life even more miserable for the two
men in each of the Zodiacs by hovering overhead, making already
choppy seas even choppier.
   Shannon Fagan, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said a Navy
ship, the 254-foot submarine support ship USS Grasp, left two
gashes in the hull of the MV Greenpeace, a 190-foot ocean-going
tug. She said the largest, about 3 feet long, was stuffed with
mattresses to keep water out.
   Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, a Navy spokeswoman, said Navy officials
at the scene reported only one hole about 1 foot in diameter in the
Greenpeace hull.
   ``This is a terrible outrage,'' said Peter Bahouth, executive
director of Greenpeace USA, in a statement. ``This is an unbridled
act of aggression against a peaceful protest in international
waters.''
   Fagan said Greenpeace was considering legal action against the
Navy.
   Greenpeace had successfully used the ship and Zodiacs to block a
Trident 2 launch attempt July 28. But the Navy was ready for them
this time.
   ``We were more prepared today because we looked at what they
tried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessary
today to clear the area,'' Bacon said.
   Once the protesters' vessels were muscled outside the 5,000-yard
diameter safety circle, the Tennessee sent the 44-foot missile
shooting out of a tube in the deck. It broke the Atlantic surface,
ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean target
several thousand miles away.
   The Navy announced the success about 20 minutes after the 10:40
a.m. launch.
   ``We issued repeated warnings to clear the area,'' Burnette said
of the Greenpeace incident. ``The MV Greenpeace acknowledged our
warnings and declared its intention to stay in the area. Two
submarine support ships, Grasp and Kittiwake, shouldered it out of
the safety arc.''
   Burnette said the warning told the protesters that if the ship
did not move, the Navy ``will exercise its rights under
international law and will forcibly remove you.''
   The MV Greenpeace radioed back, ``You are doing your best but
you haven't sunk us yet; we are staying.''
   Fagan said the ship was ``dead in the water'' for a while after
the Navy ships poured water down the smoke stacks, but the crew got
one of the two engines restarted and the ship headed for port in
Jacksonville, Fla., after non-essential people were taken off by
helicopter.
   The incident began shortly after the nuclear submarine USS
Tennessee submerged for the attempt to launch the Trident 2 missile
on its fourth test flight.
   Two of the first three Trident 2 launches from the submarine
ended in explosions just above the surface. The second in the
series was declared a success by the Navy.
   The failures, blamed on an inadequately designed nozzle system,
had set back the plan to send operational Trident 2s to sea late
this year. But if the program continues to succeed over about half
a dozen more undersea launches, the Tennessee is scheduled to go on
operational patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles. Each
is capable of hurling up to 12 nuclear warheads to different
targets more than 4,600 miles away.
   Nineteen land-launch tests, 15 of them successful, preceded the
sea trials.

   Divers managed Monday to block most
leaks in an oil tanker that sank after developing engine troubles
and officials hoped to refloat the vessel before its cargo causes
an ecological disaster.
   Up to 60 tons of the ship's 660 tons of heavy oil have polluted
the waters off this Mediterranean resort since the Israeli-owned
Eyal went down Thursday after it stalled because of engine problems
and was swamped by high seas.
   The 150-foot-long tanker, used for refueling other vessels, has
been resting on its stern with just the tip of the bow above the
surface. It is 600 yards offshore.
   Ami Barad, head of the salvage operation, said divers sealed all
leaks except some ``very small'' ones Monday and hoped the vessel
could be refloated before it breaks up.
   Heavy waves prevented a floating crane needed for the operation
from reaching the site Monday.

<TEXT>
   Church leaders Monday called on religious
individuals and organizations to provide non-judgmental and
compassionate care and support to people suffering from AIDS.
   The leaders also called on churches to develop accurate and
comprehensive AIDS education materials ``in a context that promotes
individual self-esteem, teaches the fundamental goodness of human
sexuality and supports the integrity of responsible and caring
intimate relationships.''
   The comments were included in a consensus statement on
appropriate religious responses to the AIDS epidemic adopted Monday
by about 130 clergy and lay leaders from Christian, Jewish,
Unitarian and interfaith groups during a conference at the Carter
Presidential Center.
   The religious community has a responsibility ``to assure that
all whose lives are affected by the epidemic will have access to
compassion, non-judgmental care, respect, support and assistance,''
the statement said.
   The Right Rev. Douglas E. Theuner, chairman of the Joint
Commission on AIDS and bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New
Hampshire, said church leaders must overcome a perception among
AIDS sufferers that religious people view the disease as the
``wraith of God'' for an immoral lifestyle.
   ``Some think that the religious community believes AIDS is a
judgment of God. But by and large the religious community does not
and those of us in a position of leadership need to convey that
more forcefully,'' he said.
   The consensus statement said churches have a responsibility to
``transform public attitudes and policies so that adequate care and
appropriate preventative measures will be available for all people
in need.''
   The group called on President Bush ``to demonstrate moral and
political leadership'' by protecting people with AIDS from
discrimination, by expanding drug-treatment programs to all who
choose them, by expediting the experimental treatment approval
process, by expanding home-care programs for AIDS sufferers and by
encouraging strict confidentiality of AIDS tests.
   The statement said foreigners should be allowed to visit or
become citizens of the United States if they are eligible to do so,
regardless of whether they have AIDS.
   The group also advocated comprehensive programs for drug users
``including the distribution of AIDS prevention information and
materials including bleach for the sterilization of hypodermic
needles.''
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a deadly disease
which attacks the body's immune system, crippling its ability to
ward off infections that are not a problem for most people, such as
a rare pneumonia and a rare skin cancer.
   The latest federal public health figures indicate 112,241 people
have been reported with AIDS since 1981 and 59 percent of them have
die from it. No one is known to have recovered.
   Sixty percent of the total cases have involved homosexual or
bisexual males, 20 percent were intravenous drug abusers and
another 7 percent were both drug abusers who were also homosexual
males. Forty-three percent of all cases involved minorities.
   In a reference to those statistics, the group said in its
consensus statement that, ``Because barriers among us based on
religion, race, class, gender and sexual orientation that continue
to generate fear, persecution and violence are intensified by the
(AIDS epidemic), we call upon all sectors of our society,
particularly our faith communities, to adopt as highest priority
the elimination of racism, classism, sexism and homophobia.''
   The conference was cosponsored by the AIDS National Interfaith
Network, the Atlanta Interfaith AIDS Network and The Carter Center
of Emory University.
   Among the groups represented were the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the
United Synagogue of America, the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the Baptist
General Convention of Texas, the Universal Fellowship of
Metropolitan Community Churches, the United Methodist Church, the
United Church of Christ, the Roman Catholic Church and the
Episcopal Church.

   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev left their weatherblown summit talks offering
visions of a dawning era of lasting peace, with the remnants of the
Cold War giving way to a better world.
   They announced no breakthroughs Sunday on issues that divide
their countries, such as Central America and naval disarmament, but
said that was not the point of their open-agenda dockside
encounters.
   In their parting remarks, both chose to emphasize mutual
aspirations.
   ``We sought the answer to the question where we stand now,''
Gorbachev told reporters. ``Many things that were characteristic of
the Cold War should be abandoned ... the arms race, mistrust,
psychological and ideological struggle and all that. All that
should be things of the past.''

   Battle lines in Congress are already being
drawn over whether and how to spend the money the Bush
administration plans to slice off next year's Pentagon budget.
   On one side are lawmakers who say liberalization in Eastern
Europe means the defense cuts should be large, and who want to use
the money to beef up education, child care and other domestic
programs that have been pinched in recent years.
   ``If the tearing down of the Berlin Wall means nothing more than
we put the USS Missouri in mothballs, we will not have accomplished
much,'' says liberal Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Arrayed against them are others who want to use the savings to
reduce the 1991 deficit to $64 billion, a goal universally seen as
difficult yet one that is required by the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law.

   With public resentment against the ruling
Communists reaching a fever pitch, the party's entire leadership
has resigned in disgrace and asked a committee of 25 reformers to
salvage what they can.
   Just two months ago, the party's hierarchy enforced iron-fisted
rule. Now, the former ruling elite has its back against the wall as
demands grow for punishment of those who lived in style while East
Germany sunk into crisis.
   Arrests and expulsions from the party have humbled top
officials, but the most dramatic and potentially dangerous step was
the mass resignation Sunday of party leader Egon Krenz, the 10-man
Politburo and 163-member Central Committee.
   Erich Honecker, Krenz's predecessor as party leader, and 11
other members of the hard-line old guard were expelled from the
party, three former Politburo members were arrested and the
country's chief of trade with the West fled.

   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, having aired the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, is considering probing an even more politically touchy
case linked to President Bush's family.
   Among the institutions that could be spotlighted next by the
committee are Silverado Savings and Loan Association of Denver,
declared insolvent by regulators in December 1988.
   Neil Bush, the president's son, served on Silverado's board of
directors, resigning just after his father won the Republican
nomination in 1988 and only four months before the S&amp;L's seizure.
   In a drive to oust top thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, Gonzalez
conducted six public hearings this fall focusing on regulators'
delay in acting against the Irvine, Calif.,-based Lincoln, which is
expected to become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a cost to
taxpayers of $2 billion.

   Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday as far south as
Florida, where Tampa registered just 33 degrees, and the cold plus
up to 2 feet of fresh snow closed schools and slowed travel in
parts of the Northeast.
   ``We're looking at an Arctic blast here,'' said Art Lester of
the National Weather Service in Portland, Maine.
   Authorities in Washington, Boston and Philadelphia stepped up
efforts to get homeless people into warm shelter. At least 11
deaths were blamed on the weather during the weekend.
   Pre-dawn temperatures at Albany, N.Y., were in the single
digits, but 25 mph wind made it feel like 30 degrees below zero,
the National Weather Service said.
   ``This is our first real arctic air outbreak of the season,''
said meteorologist Al Moore of the weather service at Newark, N.J.,
where it was 15 degrees Monday.

   President Bush said Monday it's too
early to proclaim an end to the Cold War, but added that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's acceptance of sweeping reform in Eastern Europe
``absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West.
   Wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at NATO
Headquarters, Bush also told reporters the United States would
maintain ``significant military forces in Europe as long as our
allies desire our presence.''
   The president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in
superpowers conventional forces in Europe ``in the bank'' before
seeking deeper reductions. He told NATO leaders he hoped a
multinational summit could be convened in Europe next summer to
sign such an accord.
   Conventional forces aside, the United States and Soviet Union
are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear
weapons, as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons.

   The Environmental Protection Agency called for
curbs Monday on the pesticide EBDC, saying widespread use of the
chemical on scores of crops from apples to tomatoes poses an
unreasonable cancer risk.
   The EPA proposed eliminating the use of the EBDC family of
fungicides on 45 crops, but said its continued use on another 10
food products, including grapes, onions and cranberries, ``do not
present an unreasonable risk'' to consumers.
   The proposed restrictions would eliminate from agricultural use
about 80 percent to 90 percent of the estimated 18 million pounds
of EBDCs that are sold annually in the United States, according to
government and industry officials.
   EBDCs, or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, are a group of pesticides
that have been used since the 1930s to control fungi and protect a
wide variety of food crops against damage from mold, mildew and
fungal diseases. The group includes the specific fungicides maneb,
mancozeb and metiram.

<HEAD>Bush Veto May Play Better in Beijing</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's latest veto will play better
in Beijing than at home, so it probably won't stand up when
Congress reconvenes. But it may serve an administration purpose in
the meantime.
   The bill Bush rejected would make it easier for Chinese exchange
students to remain in the United States for up to four years. In
his veto statement, Bush called that a laudable objective and said
he will have the same thing done administratively, without changing
the law, ``preserving my ability to manage foreign relations.''
   While the administration said all along that the bill wasn't
necessary, Congress insisted on it in response to Chinese
repression of pro-democracy dissidents last spring. Sponsors of the
student visa bill said the bloody crackdown that began in Tiananmen
Square last June 4 isn't over yet.
   There are about 40,000 Chinese students in the United States,
and more than 30,000 of them hold visas under which they are
required to return to China for at least two years before seeking
new or longer stays in this country.
   After the Tiananmen crackdown and killings, the administration
imposed limited sanctions aimed primarily at halting military sales
and cooperation. Exchange student visas were extended for a year,
so that no Chinese student would be required to leave before June
1990.
   While Bush said he will have Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
extend that stay for up to four years, supporters of the bill argue
that will mean case-by-case handling, exposing individual students
to retribution if they ever do go home.
   Because of the visa bill, the Chinese government has threatened
to prevent college students from coming to the United States to
study, and also have said it may permanently end the suspended
Fulbright scholarship program under which Americans study in China.
   ``I want to see these exchanges continue because it is in the
national interest of the United States to promote the exchange of
technical skills and ideas between Chinese and Americans,'' Bush
said in his veto message, issued last Thursday just before he left
for his Malta conferences with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``It is my hope that by acting administratively we will foster
the continuation of these programs,'' Bush said. There is no
guarantee that the veto will satisfy the Chinese since the
president said he will do what the bill required anyhow. And the
measure probably will be passed again early next year.
   Because Congress is in recess until Jan. 23, the bill was killed
by pocket veto when Bush failed to sign it by Saturday. The votes
are there to enact it again, whatever Bush does. The bill passed
the House 403 to 0, and the Senate without a dissenting voice vote.
Seventy-one senators, more than enough to override a veto, signed a
letter urging the president to sign it.
   While he didn't take their advice, Bush used the veto message to
``reemphasize my commitment ... to never allow any action that
would force the return of Chinese students if their lives or
liberty are at risk.''
   Chinese officials and educators insist that returning exchange
students face no danger or persecution, but advocates of the bill
say many of them would be in jeopardy. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said some would be forced to go underground lest they face
imprisonment or death like the Tiananmen demonstrators.
   The veto fit the advice former President Nixon brought back from
China after a six-day visit that ended Nov. 2. Nixon gave Bush an
18-page written report and met privately with the president and his
top foreign policy aides to recommend efforts to improve relations,
despite the suppression of the democracy movement.
   He said continuing sanctions would only strengthen reactionaries
in the Chinese government. Even so, Nixon didn't anticipate the
veto, saying Bush probably had no choice politically but to sign
congressional sanctions.
   The reasoning in Nixon's China memo suggests that even an
unsuccessful veto might help Bush in future dealings with Beijing.
The former president, who sent Bush to China as U.S. representative
after ties between the two nations were reopened in 1972, said
Bush's personal standing with the Chinese is a positive factor.
   ``In our sometimes very tense discussions, not one of the
Chinese leaders had a negative word to say about President Bush,''
Nixon said. ``They would sometimes blame the Congress, the media
and the Voice of America, but never the president.''

   Talking with Elizabeth Ashley is a grand
adventure. She has fierce energy and a jumpy, bawdy sense of humor.
Her sentences go every which way but loose, full of digressions,
asides and hard sayings. Such as:
   ``Football is an absolute metaphor for life. If you want nice,
clean, let's-pretend sports, watch tennis.''
   Technically, that has nothing to do with her latest venture. But
it's the thought that counts.
   Her latest venture, on cable TV Thursday, is an Arts &amp;
Entertainment version of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Rope.'' She, her
fellow Tony-award winners Jose Ferrer and Len Cariou, and Brad
Davis co-star in it.
   One of four adaptations of one-act plays by Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwrights, Thursday's one-hour drama is, in the
O'Neill custom, a poetic, bitter tale _ in this case one about a
family torn by despair.
   She has known that world of well-scrivened gloom before. But it
proved a particularly good deal in 1974. Then, several years after
a string of so-so TV movies and a busted marriage to actor George
Peppard, whom she refers to only as ``the husband,'' she went back
to theater.
   It was part of a process of starting all over again, says
Ashley, who'd been hailed as an actress of great promise when she
won Broadway's Tony award in 1962 as the bouncy, nubile daughter in
``Take Her, She's Mine.''
   Twelve years later, she says, ``the American Shakesepeare
Festival and Tennessee Williams saved me from being a third-rate
television actress today with `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'''
   In that New York revival, she was acclaimed for her
interpretation of Maggie, the Southern beauty married to an
alcoholic.
   Herself a Southern beauty to whom time has been tender, Ashley,
50, was born in Ocala, Fla., and raised in Baton Rouge, La. She is
a veteran, she says, of one semester at Louisiana State University.
   She came to New York at 18 to model and appear in commercials.
Then she studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse, paying the
way by waiting tables and playing guitar, ``plunking a few chords
and singing your odd songs.''
   Possessed of a husky, well-modulated voice, she is not thought
of as a singer. Still, she once appeared in a Los Angeles
production of a short-lived musical by her friend Dory Previn,
``Mary C Brown and the Hollywood Sign.''
   Her own assessment: ``I'm not your best singer of show tunes.
I'm a pretty good country singer, though, and I was a great rock
'n' roll screamer.''
   She said all this and more when interviewed in her favorite
bistro, where she periodically lit a cigarette and cheerfully
denounced both yuppies and no-smoking fiends who've ruined most
bistros.
   Her life, which includes a son, Christian Peppard, now 21, has
taken a goodly measure of ups and downs. Ten years ago, after she'd
taken a few years off to go sailing and ponder the cosmos and such,
it was down time.
   She had all the goodies, she says _ a house in Santa Monica, two
lofts in New York, a couple of costly foreign cars. But there was
only $83 in the till. She rented out the house, sold the cars, and
awaited developments.
   She got a call for a Broadway part. It was as the chain-smoking
psychiatrist in what proved a hit, ``Agnes of God.''
   ``That was God kissing me on the cheek,'' she says. ``The second
time around.''
   Ashley, who this year filmed an NBC movie, ``Orleans,'' and
starts off-Broadway rehearsals next month on ``When She Danced,''
about dancer Isadora Duncan, spent 14 months on Broadway in ``Agnes
of God.''
   Then, she says, she spent 40 more weeks on the road, touring in
the play. More than a few actors hate touring. Not Ashley.
   ``I like the road,'' she says. ``It's great to be in a Broadway
hit and a long run. But they know where you are then, and people
start calling you and asking you to do things like'' _ she laughed
and winced _ ``lunch.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   SAME TIME, THIS YEAR _ Morton Downey Jr., whose syndicated shout
show got axed last summer due to fleeing sponsors and declining
ratings, returned to TV Monday. He's back bellowing on cable,
CBNC's ``Showdown,'' where his co-host, who also is a co-bellower,
is Richard G. Carter, a New York Daily News columnist.
   Monday's scheduled premiere threatened a discussion with a
Boston city councilman of suspects' and victims' rights. But it
often degenerated into hostile co-host babble, with Carter twice
calling Downey ``sick.'' Downey in turn accused his black colleague
of being hung up on racial issues, then sneered that ``I even get
my makeup put on darker so we'll match.''
   For the record, the new show has a studio audience and Downey
now wears a gold ring in his left ear lobe.

<HEAD>Equity Rich, Cash Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as $750 billion of equity is held by
homeowners who are 65 years or older, a category in which financial
stress is rising because, among other things, of higher taxes and
health care costs.
   In some instances, older couples meet expenses only by reducing
their lives to the bare elements, or worse, while simultaneously
sitting atop six figures of housing assets. They are well off _ but
cash poor.
   The situation, always a cause of distress among social workers,
government officials and others concerned with the elderly, is
becoming even more so as large numbers of people enter the upper
age categories.
   Simultaenously, the houses in which they live sometimes continue
to rise in value, creating an even more pronounced contrast between
cash flow and value tied up in real estate.
   Repeated attempts to resolve the dilemma have been made over the
years, but no private-sector mortgage lender, insurer or other
financial institution has marketed a popular solution.
   Two of the great fears are clearly revealed in surveys: 1.
having enough money to live on, and 2. having to move from the
house.
   Among the possible solutions now available:
   1. Sell the house and with the proceeds move into a retirement
community. For many people this is a practical solution, but it
doesn't help those who want to remain right where they are.
   2. Sale-leaseback. The house is sold, but the former owners
remain where they are. They obtain a guarantee of residency. Money
from the sale is invested, and some of it may be used to pay the
rent.
   Drawback: Insecurity resulting from unknowns, chief of which is
the ability to make a sufficient return on investments to make
monthly rental payments.
   3. Home equity line of credit. This enables the owners to draw
on home equity to meet unanticipated expenses. The drawback is fear
of exhausting the credit line because of living expenses or
longevity.
   4. Reverse mortgage. Under this plan, monthly sums are withdrawn
from the equity and, along with a charge, sent by the lending
institution to the owner. In the best of them, the owner receives
written assurance of lifetime tenure.
   Still, there are drawbacks. If the reverse mortgage is for a
fixed term, rather than for life, the monthly income is higher, but
the assurance of a roof over the head is gone. Lifetime tenure, in
effect a reverse annuity mortgage, reduces insecurity but pays
relatively little each month.
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates
that for a 70-year-old borrower, a reverse mortgage on a $100,000
home at 10 percent produces $654 a month for five years or $411 for
a 10-year period.
   However, if the reverse mortgage is for lifetime tenure, the
monthly amount drops sharply to $278.
   Actuarial tables suggest strongly that, if possible, it might be
wise to delay implementing a reverse mortgage. At age 75, for
example, the 5-year note would pay $812, the 10-year mortgage $510,
and the tenure mortgage $367.
   An encouraging development, but largely experimental, is offered
through certain lenders by the Federal Housing Administration,
which has agreed to insure 2,500 reverse mortgages through
September 1991.
   The issue, however, is much larger than that, and it will become
more so as the population ages, the equity piles up and the need to
use it becomes pressing. What's needed is the proper product.

   The changes sweeping Eastern Europe are
reshaping the Continent. Suddenly the old bipolar equation _
Western Europe vs. Eastern Europe _ has been overturned by the
rebirth of an older geographical entity called Central Europe.
   The script is having to be rewritten almost every week. Will
Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia become Western
democracies? Will the Germanys be united? And if united, will the
German colossus once again threaten Europe's stability? To try to
answer some of these questions, The Associated Press asked five
West European commentators to contribute their thoughts.
   The following overview, the first of five articles, was written
by Adrian G.V. Hyde-Price, a research fellow on the International
Security Program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London, specializing in East-West relations and European security.

   Thursday, Nov. 9, the day the East German
authorities allowed their citizens to travel freely to the West,
marks the simultaneous end of the Cold War and the emergence of the
``German question'' as the decisive issue of European politics.
   The lifting of the Iron Curtain is cause for celebration and
euphoria. At the same time the strategic and political
ramifications are enormous, and therefore it is also cause for
sober reflection and what the Dutch foreign minister has called
``constructive alertness.''
   The bipolar structures of the Cold War effectively displaced
deep-seated national and ethnic rivalries in Europe, and replaced
them with a security system which was, for all its many faults,
relatively stable and predictable. One of the crucial features of
this security order was the division of Germany, which provided a
degree of reassurance to many of Germany's traditional opponents.
   Today, however, the old certainties and assumptions of the
postwar period are disintegrating under the combined impact of the
changes _ associated above all with perestroika in the East, and
the 1992 abolition of internal tariff barriers in the European
Economic Community. This is nowhere more apparent than in Central
Europe where, as the Cold War divisions fade away, older patterns
of cooperation and conflict are re-emerging. Changes in this
sensitive region, however, inevitably open the Pandora's box of the
``German question,'' which is now the central issue of European
politics.
   The ``German question'' predates the division of Germany and
stems from the difficulty of integrating German power into the
European interstate system. Germany has traditionally been the
fulcrum of the European balance of power, and this is why the
recent assertion of ``people power'' in the German Democratic
Republic has led to so much discussion about the future of Europe.
   The reform process in East Germany will inevitably entail a
qualitative change in inner-German relations, and therefore a
substantial shift in the balance of power in continental Europe.
   The worries are twofold:
   First, there is the immediate concern about West Germany's
growing economic, political and military weight in Europe. This has
already been felt within the EEC and NATO, where the West Germans
have shown themselves willing and able to assert their national
interests, on economic and financial matters as well as over the
issue of modernizing Short-range Nuclear Forces.
   In Eastern Europe, West German economic and political influence
has been expanding as the military and political dominance of the
Soviet Union has declined. West Germany is now well placed,
geographically, economically and culturally, to benefit from the
new markets and investment opportunities opened up by the reform
movements in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. At the same time,
the ``renewal'' movement in East Germany will inevitably bring the
two German states closer together, particularly in the economic
sphere, thereby facilitating West German penetration of the rest of
Eastern Europe. Bonn is thus set to become both an economic and a
political giant in European politics.
   Second, there is the fear that in the long term a reunified,
centralized German nation-state (a ``Fourth Reich'') could emerge.
Its precondition would be the collapse of East Germany as a viable
political and economic entity.
   This gives rise to two possible scenarios. First, West Germany
simply expanding to absorb East Germany, while remaining a member
of both the EEC and NATO. This would be unacceptable to the Soviet
Union and might unbalance economic and political relations within
the Western alliance. The second possibility is that the Soviet
Union, faced with a disintegrating East German state, might decide
to make the best of a bad deal, and allow Germany to unite and
remain a member of NATO, provided it became fully denuclearized and
all foreign troops withdrew from German soil.
   This might be acceptable to the Germans, but it would spell the
end of NATO as an effective military alliance.
   In order to assuage fears of a reunited and resurgent ``Fourth
Reich,'' therefore, it is essential that the West collectively
formulate a strategy for managing the changes in East-Central
Europe and in inner-German relations. Above all, a broader European
framework must be forged within which the ``German question'' can
be successfully managed.
   This involves recognizing that the self-determination of the
German people does not necessarily entail reunification, and that
the central issue in Germany at the moment is the democratization
of East Germany.
   Also, a unified or confederated Germany would only be acceptable
to Germany's neighbors in the context of a European Community that
is both well advanced along the path toward economic and political
union, and that is open to new forms of cooperation and association
with other democracies in Europe. Within this broader European
framework, German power could be diffused upward to the
supranational institutions of the EEC and downward to its own
regional governments.

   Initial comment on the extraordinary
events that culminated in the breach of the Berlin Wall tended to
dwell on the damage these developments might inflict on the
European Community.
   The Federal Republic, it has been suggested, would now be much
more interested in reunification than in Western European
integration. Every mark spent in Leipzig was one less mark
available for Lisbon. Encouraged perhaps by calculations of this
kind, those who were opposed anyway to speeding up the EC
integration process by, for example, the convening of an
intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union seized
the occasion offered by the events in Germany and elsewhere to
counsel caution.
   Now was not the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great
Britain and her allies proclaimed, for the EEC to dwell on its own
internal problems when so much was happening beyond its frontiers.
   These early reactions are beginning to appear rather
superficial. None of us, it should be stressed, has much idea of
how events will develop in the East. They are beyond our control.
They also seem to be beyond the control of either government or
opposition leaders.
   The reunification issue is an example. Sober reflection a few
days after the Wall came down suggested that speculation about
prospects for German unity was largely a Western phenomenon. A few
days later, banners in Leipzig proclaiming unification as a highly
desirable objective complicated the picture yet again. Where the
East is going and how quickly remains uncertain.
   These uncertainties have not, however, prevented the emergence
of a fairly widespread consensus among Western European leaders
themselves that in the new circumstances the EC, far from being
redundant, is the indispensable cornerstone of any new European
system. This consensus, manifested at the highest levels at the
Paris dinner party for the heads of government and state of the 12
EC member countries in November rests on various assumptions:
   _That the European Community is the surest framework within
which the Germans themselves can pursue an active policy toward the
East and eventually perhaps achieve reunification.
   _That in a period in which the emphasis in East-West relations
is bound to rest on economic and non-military matters, the European
Community is best placed to coordinate and channel Western aid and
technical assistance.
   _That in a broader perspective, the Community can and should be
seen not only as the most appropriate basis for the European pillar
of the Atlantic alliance, but also as the indispensable Western
pillar in a new European security system in which the Soviet Union
will remain a military superpower regardless of what happens to the
Warsaw Pact.
   Against this background, it is now possible to see the Eastern
developments as a catalyst of Western integration. In the new
circumstances, European Community leaders are almost sure to
demonstrate their determination to continue with their own progress
toward union: Economic and Monetary Union is the obvious practical
initiative, for which highly developed plans already exist.
   In any case, it is already obvious that the Community will be at
the center of a number of high profile efforts to assist the East
directly. These economic and technical means will furthermore be
backed up by even more conspicuous political initiatives involving,
as President Francois Mitterrand of France implied after the Paris
summit, visits to Eastern Europe at the highest level.
   Finally, the acceleration of events and the obvious intention of
European Community leaders to play an active role can only
strengthen those elements in the Bush administration who already
see the Community collectively as the ideal long-term partner with
whom to discuss not only economic issues, but also political and
security questions.
   For those committed to the further development of European
union, these prospects can only be highly gratifying. There are,
however, serious dangers that the West European themselves should
be the first to recognize and deal with:
   _A stronger Western Europe organized through the European
Community can and should be a major asset to the Western Alliance.
It is not, however, as currently organized, in any practical sense
linked to the alliance machinery.
   _More important, a stronger Western Europe that is a magnet to
the East almost certainly will be seen in the Soviet Union as a
potential threat, ready in the worst case to gobble up dissident
members of the Warsaw Pact. However unfounded these fears may be,
the Community should take active steps to reassure the Soviet Union
and to cooperate with it.

   Last Nov. 9, 1989, East German
authorities decided to open their borders with West Germany. By now
almost half the population in East Germany has traveled to West
Berlin or to the Federal Republic to see for themselves what this
capitalist society really is like.
   More important, this mass migration westward turned into an
emotional get-together of the Germans, not just for those who had
not seen their relatives for many years, but for everybody.
   Undoubtedly, the opening of the border, symbolized spectacularly
by the instantaneous scrapping of large sections of the hideous
Wall, was a tactical move of the Communist authorities intended to
open a safety valve and head off the constant stream of
demonstrations in almost all major cities in the German Democratic
Republic.
   This strategy may perhaps still succeed in part, but all the
same the situation has changed fundamentally. The peaceful mass
demonstrations have above all achieved one thing: Suddenly the
fear, instilled by an oppressive police state for so many years,
has given way to a new self-confidence.
   The momentous events not only in the GDR, but in East-Central
Europe may perhaps be called the beginning of a Third Democratic
Revolution (the first was the age from 1760 to 1800 highlighted by
the American and French revolutions, and the second by the gradual,
though not continuous advance of democratic government in the West
since the beginning of the 20th century).
   For one, Marxist-Leninist ideology is discredited. The highly
bureaucratic and oppressive system of a centrally directed
socialist economy, which had been established in East Germany
perhaps more effectively than anywhere else, has failed
disastrously. Just a few people on the top, so it emerges, were
capable of making far-reaching decisions affecting the economic
performance of a whole country without any effective control and
almost wholly on ideological grounds. Now democratization has
become unavoidable by any standards.
   Besides, the crumbling of the Wall will imply that the East
German economy can no longer be run in isolation. Between the two
German states, economic cooperation on the governmental and private
levels as well as much economic help will be needed to forestall a
complete breakdown of the economy and mass deprivation in East
Germany, something that would be in nobody's interest. This may
require establishing special links between the Federal Republic,
West Berlin and East Germany. It remains to be seen whether in the
medium term these will devolve into a sort of German confederation,
as seems likely, or whether they will be kept on an informal level
that does not affect the statehood of either of the two Germanys.
   Right now the people from both Germanys are reluctant to go any
further. The West Germans do not want to weaken the close political
and economic ties they have established with the West. Neither are
they prepared to abandon the alliances with the West, even though
the danger of an aggression from the Soviet Union may become
remote. Instead they hope that all steps regarding the
intensification of the relations with East Germany, as well as with
the other East-Central European countries, will be done in full
cooperation with their Western partners.
   The time may be ripe for a second Marshall Plan, this time to be
organized on an international level, with the active participation
not only of the United States and the European Economic Community,
but possibly also Japan. It all depends, however, on what happens
in the Soviet Union itself. West Germans are now perhaps more than
ever interested in making things easier for Mikhail Gorbachev, in
order to see his reform policies succeed. For they are fully aware
that all depends upon whether the Soviet Union will tolerate the
process of democratization in East Central Europe, and in
particular in East Germany.
   Come what may, the democratic revolution under way in Poland,
Hungary, and now East Germany and Czechoslovakia, will change the
course of history. A return to the old ways of a bureaucratic
socialism seems unlikely. The national idea, long believed to be
gradually supplanted by the European idea, seems to have a
remarkable revival. However, it may no longer be quite the
dangerous creature to which we have grown accustomed in the 1920s
and 1930s. Rather it is a nationalism that believes in a Europe of
free nations.

   Britain is in, but not of, Europe. She
did not share the psychology of the original six who founded the
European Community in 1958 _France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, all of whom
suffered from fascism and enemy occupation.
   For them, World War II showed that the nation-state had to be
overcome through the creation of supranational institutions. For
Britain, the war meant the triumph of the nation-state _ her finest
hour. Not feeling ashamed of her past, she felt assured of her
future as a global superpower, the center of a worldwide empire
rather than a middle-ranking European country.
   She has always known that sooner or later she will have to put
aside her ambivalence and decide whether to join the Continent or
stand aside. The cataclysmic changes in central and eastern Europe
ought to bring this moment of truth closer.
   Although the late French president Charles de Gaulle did his
best to keep Britain out of the European Community, the British
approach to Europe has always been Gaullist. Britain favors a
Europe of cooperating but sovereign independent nations, rather
than any pooling of sovereignty. Entering the Community in 1973,
she thought she was joining merely a customs union rather than a
dynamic organization whose purpose was European union. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher has given forceful expression to this
conception of Europe.
   Superficially, the changes in central and eastern Europe make
the British government's case for a loosely organized Community
more plausible. For if Central Europe is being unraveled, what is
the sense in continuing with the creation of a closed Community in
the West?
   Instead, so the British argument goes, new forms of association
need to be created that can bridge the ever-narrowing ideological
gap between West and East. It would be parochial to concentrate on
the machinery of integration _exchange rates, monetary union and
the like _ when the solid scaffolding of the Europe we knew is
disintegrating before our eyes.
   This conception, in the view of most of the other governments in
the Community, ignores the vastly increased danger of instability
in Central Europe. The withdrawal of Communism is likely to bring
to the surface all kinds of national conflicts, submerged since the
war through the might of the Soviet Empire. In particular, a
reunited Germany, which now looks a distinct possibility, could
threaten the balance of power in Europe.
   It especially frightens the Poles, whose frontiers, in the
absence of a peace treaty, have still to be finally agreed; and the
French, invaded three times by Germany in the past 120 years. The
French, therefore, are in the vanguard of those arguing that German
reunification can only be safely attempted if Germany becomes fully
integrated into the European Community.
   Britain does not share this fear of Germany. Less traumatized by
World War II, she was more willing to forgive and forget. Less
scarred by history, she finds it difficult to imagine a reunited
Germany as anything other than benign. Traditionally, Britain's
role in Europe has been to stand apart, preserving the balance of
power against the attempt of any single power to dominate the
Continent. That remains the instinct of many leading British
Conservatives.
   The opposition Labor Party has recently taken a distinctly more
pro-European stance. Yet this transformation of attitudes _ it was
the Conservatives who took Britain into the Community, while as
recently as 1983 Labor was promising withdrawal from it _ owes as
much to hostility toward Mrs. Thatcher as to genuine European
conviction.
   There are signs that attitudes are changing. Survey evidence
earlier this year suggested that 55 percent of the British
electorate regarded the Community as a ``good thing,'' the highest
figure since Britain joined. The Euro-elections, which were
catastrophic for Mrs. Thatcher, showed that there is no longer a
strong anti-European constituency in Britain.
   It remains to be seen whether the convulsions in Central Europe
will finally convince the public that Britain is essentially a
European power. Eventually, Britain will have to make a decision of
principle _ whether she wishes to be part of the new political
entity being created in Western Europe, or remain an offshore
island devoid of both power and influence.

   Is communism dead?
   Everyone knows that communism is not confined geographically to
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   A billion Chinese and millions of Vietnamese, Laotians,
Ethiopians, Romanians, Afghans and Cubans still live under
communist regimes that have remained Stalinist or become born-again
Stalinists.
   The Cambodian conflict is not between communism and democracy
but rather between two types of communism. At the end of 1989,
there were still 50,000 Cuban soldiers in Angola protecting a
non-elected communist power.
   Mozambique's economy has been destroyed in a disastrous
experiment with Marxism and by the civil war that followed. Many
quasi-Marxist regimes _ in Madagascar, Algeria, Benin and Nicaragua
_ continue to starve their populations and start wars, at home or
with their neighbors or both.
   I firmly believe that communism is dying. But communism is far
from having disappeared.
   There is no doubt communism is fading rapidly in Eastern Europe
where it has never been accepted and where it has always been seen
as an imported system, imposed and maintained artificially by a
foreign power.
   When the threat of military repression became highly unlikely,
thanks to the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev, the desire for
democracy could explode freely. So can we say the Cold War is over,
as the current phrase has it? Not quite.
   For what is the Cold War? It was the direct result of Stalin's
annexation of Eastern Europe, freed from the Nazis by the Red Army
and immediately re-occupied by that same Red Army.
   What does Gorbachev say? That these countries can become
political democracies with market economies provided they remain in
the same geostrategic and diplomatic framework as the Cold War. In
other words, if they regain their internal freedom, these countries
remain satellites as far as foreign policy is concerned, for the
time being anyway.
   This is the position Gorbachev has been pushing hard and it has
been accepted by the West. Generally known as ``Finlandization,''
it is much more than that for the Warsaw Pact countries.
   Finland is not directly included in Soviet military calculations
and does not have Soviet troops stationed in its territory. One can
foresee that the Warsaw Pact agreements _ never freely negotiated
by the peoples concerned _ will have to be re-examined by their
future democratic governments, eager to become sovereign states
once again.
   As for the Soviet Union, the major new element is the failure of
perestroika. No one in the West seems to have clearly grasped this,
but every Soviet citizen now takes it for granted _ even economists
in Gorbachev's entourage.
   For nearly five years, the Soviet leader has tried to get the
Soviet economy back on its feet by using a ``market socialism''
formula which injects a little pragmatism and profit motive in an
overall structure that remains intact.
   Result: In 1985, the situation was bad; today it is
catastrophic. Communism can be discarded; it cannot be repaired.
That is, if you begin to really repair it, you quickly realize that
the only way out is dropping it altogether. That's what has
happened in Hungary and Poland. That's what China refused to do,
resorting to mass terror.
   The Soviet Union has not made a clear choice between capitalism
with private property or the return to Stalinist collectivism.

   A Pentagon historian with access to
still-classified war records has put together a remarkable new book
on what went on behind the scenes as U.S. leaders sought a way to
give the war in Vietnam back to the Vietnamese. ``The Final
Years,'' by Jeffrey Clarke of the Army's Center of Military
History, gives previously undisclosed details of a tug of war
between the secretary of defense and his top generals.

   Ill-led, ill-trained, plagued by corruption
and desertion, the army of South Vietnam found itself relegated to
backwater skirmishes and hamlet defenses in its own war. The
Americans, with half a million soldiers, had taken over,
shouldering aside the people they had been sent to ``advise.''
   But back home, the American people lost their stomach for a war
that seemed endless, pointless, unwinnable, and a new president,
Richard M. Nixon, cast about for a way to get out without losing.
He toyed with getting tougher.
   His defense secretary, Melvin R. Laird, formerly a hawkish
congressman from Wisconsin, had a different idea.
   Laird called it ``de-Americanization,'' then changed that to
``Vietnamization.'' It was supposed to mean retreat without defeat.
It provided that if talks under way in Paris failed to bring peace
to Vietnam, the Vietnamese would be left to fight the war alone.
``Vietnamization'' would train them and supply them to take over _
just as John F. Kennedy once said, so many lives before.
   The U.S. military, both in Vietnam and in the Pentagon, resisted
Laird's plan. They read Vietnamization as a slow road to disaster.
They felt the South Vietnamese, alone, could not, in the jargon of
the day, ``hack it.''
   And so was fought a war-within-the-war, a battle between Nixon,
Laird and Henry A. Kissinger, on one side, and the military command
in the Defense Department and at military headquarters in the field
on the other. It was a battle over whether the United States could
extract itself honorably from a war without winning it _ or at
least get out of the business of fighting it.
   Laird, now an executive of the Readers Digest, says the United
States had little choice but to find a route out.
   ``I knew we had to withdraw,'' he said in a recent telephone
interview. ``We could not continue Americanizing the war. We had to
de-Americanize it. I got that into the Republican platform in 1968.
The term Vietnamization _ I invented that. I named it.''
   The story of the tug of war behind the Laird strategy is the
chief topic of a new volume in a series of books by Pentagon
historians on the American experience in Vietnam.
   The book, ``The Final Years,'' by Jeffrey Clarke, a civilian
historian on the staff of the Army's Center of Military History,
documents how a defense secretary forced a resisting military
establishment to give the war back to the South Vietnamese, telling
details never previously revealed.
   It is part of a ``comprehensive and objective'' account of
America's experience in Vietnam which, even before the war had
ended, the center had decided to produce.
   ``Clarke proves beyond a shadow of a doubt what I had suspected
and seen traces of in fragmentary documentary evidence 10 years ago
but couldn't really prove,'' says George Herring, a University of
Kentucky professor and one of the country's leading historians of
the war.
   Herring calls the Pentagon's accounts ``first-rate and
balanced.'' ``It is remarkable that they could come out of an Army
agency,'' he says. ``It reflects well on the Army.''
   Clarke had access to still-classified war records. He uses 19
pages to list his sources of information _ records from the
Pentagon, the U.S. Embassy and U.S. military headquarters in
Saigon, the files of Kissinger's National Security Council, the
debriefing papers of senior American officers and memoirs written
by former Vietnamese military leaders at the request of the Army.
   His thesis: Washington forced both the idea and the timetable of
Vietnamization upon a U.S. military that felt what Laird demanded _
a plan to make South Vietnam quickly capable of prosecuting the war
alone _ was simply beyond Saigon's capacity to achieve.
   ``Despite the divergent view of the major U.S. agencies involved
in the war effort and despite the unanimous opinion of these same
agencies that the South Vietnamese could never deal with a combined
Viet Cong-North Vietnamese Army threat, the new administration had
instructed the American military command to develop plans for
turning over almost the entire ground war effort to the forces of
Saigon,'' he wrote.
   Gen. Creighton W. Abrams Jr., the U.S. commander, and his
generals insisted that tens of thousands of Americans would be
required to stay behind in a support and air combat role if
Vietnamization were to have any hope of staving off a communist
victory.
   But Laird thought the military was stalling. He demanded a plan
to extricate American troops.
   Laird, of course, prevailed. The withdrawals started in
mid-1969, continued while Kissinger sought to reach an accord with
the North Vietnamese in both secret and public four-party talks in
Paris and ended in December 1973, with the last American troops
brought home.
   Sixteen months later, the Kissinger peace process having
collapsed, communists rolled triumphantly into Saigon and the war
was over.
   Nixon had been elected in 1968 after promising to end the war.
   Seeking the Republican nomination, he said in New Hampshire in
February that if the war had not ended by Election Day ``the
American people will be justified to elect new leadership, and I
pledge to you the new leadership will end the war and win the peace
in the Pacific.''
   He said he did not mean ``withdrawal from Vietnam,'' but
contended the war ``can be ended'' if ``we mobilize our economic
and political and diplomatic leadership.'' But he refused to
elaborate, brushed aside all effort to draw him out. Nixon's idea
became known as his ``secret plan'' to end the war.
   Eighteen years had passed since the first U.S. aid had gone to
aid the French fight communist insurgents in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia. Nine years had passed since the first two American
soldiers had been killed in Vietnam.
   The American people had grown war-weary. Casualties kept rising
but victory was not in sight and the Saigon government was seen as
dictatorial and corrupt.
   All told, 30,000 Americans had been killed in action by the time
Nixon was sworn in; another 16,000 battle deaths were to occur
during the withdrawals. In addition, 10,000 Americans died off the
battlefields, mostly in planes that were shot down.

   ``Nixon had suggested the existence of a `secret plan' to end
the war during his presidential campaign,'' Clarke writes, but
after three months in the White House he ``had yet to come up with
any alternatives to the application of greater force, and the
secretary (Laird) felt that he had a better idea.''
   Says Laird now: ``The `secret plan' was in my head. ...
Withdrawal was the only alternative we had and we had to do it in
an orderly fashion. You could have had public support for the first
two years, probably, but not beyond that.''
   So on March 5, 1969, six weeks after Nixon's inauguration, Laird
flew to Saigon to present his concept of scheduled, systematic
withdrawals _ to take place regardless of what was happening on the
battlefield _ to Abrams, a tank commander who in 1968 had succeeded
Gen. William C. Westmoreland as chief of the Military Assistance
Command, Vietnam (MACV).
   According to Clarke's account, the general balked, insisting
``that all withdrawals depend on his assessment of the military
situation in Vietnam.''
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff backed up Abrams, setting the stage
for a long struggle between Washington and MACV.
   Laird's recollection is somewhat different. He says Abrams might
have made his objections known, but always ultimately went along
with Laird.
   ``General Abrams pointed out certain reasons why he thought the
program I laid out was too rapid a withdrawal ... but he was more
supportive of my withdrawal figures than were the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. That's why I promoted Abrams to Army chief of staff over the
objections of the White House. They were not great Abrams fans
there.''
   In any event, it was a struggle. Here's the story, as laid out
in Clarke's official history:
   _In March 1969 Laird returns from his visit to Saigon and
reports to Nixon that the size of the American contingency is
actually stiffling South Vietnamese initiative.
   He says the ``orientation'' of American military leaders ``seems
to be more on operations than on assisting the South Vietnamese to
acquire the means to defend themselves.'' That, he says, explains
MACV's tolerance of Saigon's high military desertion rate and
marginal military leadership. He says MACV has no program to reduce
the American military commitment and contends ``the development of
such a program should receive our first priority.''
   He recommends withdrawing 50,000 to 75,000 soldiers in 1969.
   _Abrams approves tentative planning for withdrawing 50,000
soldiers but repeats ``his personal opposition to unilateral U.S.
troop withdrawals and his insistence that all withdrawals depend on
his assessment of the military situation in Vietnam.''
   _In April 1969, Kissinger, with Nixon's approval, embraces
Laird's concept and signs a directive instructing the defense
secretary to prepare ``a specific timetable for Vietnamizing the
war.'' His directive foresees ``the progressive transfer ... of the
fighting effort'' to South Vietnamese forces without insisting on
an expansion of the South Vietnamese army _ and even without
awaiting a reduction in the number of North Vietnamese troops in
South Vietnam.
   Kissinger says U.S. withdrawals are to start July 1. The United
States is to return to a support and advisory mission in Vietnam.
   _In May, Abrams questions the size and pace of the projected
withdrawals. Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
assures him that Kissinger's July 1 target was picked only for
planning purposes. Wheeler says American redeployments will take
into consideration the military situation.
   ``But Abrams knew better and his concern proved justified,'' the
book says. ``Only a few days after Wheeler's second communique, he
received notice that withdrawals might come sooner than expected
and to prepare alternate plans for the redeployment of 50,000 and
100,000 troops.''
   _MACV reluctantly draws up a Vietnamization plan but it is based
on the ``major assumption'' that about 275,000 support troops will
remain following the withdrawal of most combat forces. That
insistence on maintaining a huge support contingent, Clarke says,
was ``the principal response of American military leaders to what
seemed to be an impossible order'' from Washington.
   In its war assessment, MACV advises Washington that the South
Vietnamese will not be capable before 1972 of handling even the
Viet Cong _ not to mention the heavily armed and better-trained
North Vietnamese _ and even then U.S. advisory and materiel support
will be required ``indefinitely.''
   MACV says that until then the Saigon forces ``simply are not
capable of attaining the level of self-sufficiency and overwhelming
force superiority that would be required to counter combined Viet
Cong insurgency and North Vienamese Army main force offenses.''
   _In June, Nixon announces the withdrawal of the first 25,000
Americans. He meets with South Vietnam President Nguyen Van Thieu
at Midway Island to discuss Vietnamization.
   ``Saigon accepted American withdrawals as a political
necessity,'' Clarke writes.
   But Thieu points out that the Americans had been preparing
Saigon merely, as Clarke put it, ``to deal with a residual
insurgency,'' not to square off against the strength of the entire
North Vietnamese army.
   The South Vietnamese president asks for an immense increase in
military equipment if his army is to fight both the Viet Cong
insurgents and the North Vietnamese army _ heavy main battle tanks
and missile tanks, howitzers, artillery, radar, anti-aircraft
missiles, C-130 air transports and 95 other aircraft _ as well as
the wherewithal for a big expansion of Saigon's air, armor and
artillery units. Additionally, Thieu wants a big injection of
financial aid to improve the living standards of South Vietnamese
servicemen.
   _Abrams advises Laird that most of Thieu's requests are unneeded
and, Clarke wrote, ``too expensive and too complex for the South
Vietnamese to manage by themselves.'' Abrams still assumes American
units will provide air defenses, even under Vietnamization.
   ``He further advised Washington that no new weapons be added to
Saigon's arsenal until the South Vietnamese became able to operate
and maintain them.'' He opposes Thieu's request for financial
support for South Vietnamese forces, arguing MACV should not be in
the business of raising living standards ``for one segment'' of the
population.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreeing, says Saigon's equipment is
adequate in terms of ``the limited Vietnamese technical
capability.''
   Moreover, the book says, the chiefs say the Vietnamese had not
addressed at Midway ``what American advisers considered key South
Vietnamese military weaknesses _ poor leadership and high desertion
rates.''

    _In August Laird approves Abrams' proposals for increasing
Saigon's strength. In the interest of economy, he makes it clear
that whatever money and equipment is provided to Saigon is to come
out of the budgets of the U.S. military. He asks the Joint Chiefs
of Staff ``to put together a new program that would enable the
South Vietnamese to deal successfully with a combined Viet
Cong-North Vietnamese threat,'' Clarke says. MACV is also told to
come up with a plan to improve Saigon's leadership abilities and
reduce desertions.
   _In September MACV replies: Even the increases in Saigon's
forces will not enable them to handle a combined Viet Cong-North
Vietnamese threat without direct U.S. combat assistance.
   ``According to MACV, Saigon's armed forces could not be expanded
beyond the presently authorized manpower ceiling of 993,000, nor
could they be improved qualitatively to the extent necessary to
deal with a combined threat,'' Clarke writes. ``What the secretary
wanted simply could not be done ... Neither Abrams nor his staff
was able to suggest any changes in Saigon's military organization,
strategy or tactics that would enable the South Vietnamese to deal
with a combined enemy threat.''
   Adm. John S. McCain Jr., Pacific commander, stresses the danger
of overtaxing Saigon's manpower and training capacity. He tells
Laird that ``further acceleration could prove self-defeating.''
   _November. ``Laird refused to take no for an answer,'' Clarke
says. The secretary orders the services for the third time to come
up with a suitable plan and puts them on notice ``that a large
residual support force was not in the offing.'' Laird wants an
``imaginative'' plan that, he says, will address the ``critical
problems of corruption, leadership, motivation and morale.''
   _December. MACV complies, drafting a more optimistic plan. It is
based on the assumption, however, that there will be success for
Saigon's expansion programs, progress on the battlefield and a
declining North Vietnamese Army threat and it ignores Hanoi's
forces massed just outside the borders of South Vietnam.
   But even this new plan is tied to the existence of a large
American residual support force, and Clarke says, Laird's staff
``suspected that the military was still trying to use its
evaluations of South Vietnamese military capabilities to stall the
withdrawal process.''
   _February, 1970. Laird revisits Saigon, communicates his
disappointment over the lack of any new or fresh concepts. The
South Vietnamese ask for more arms, including 175mm artillery
pieces that can fire over the demilitarized zone into North Vietnam
and for financial assistance to raise soldiers' living standards.
Laird returns to Washington and asks the military for an even
stronger plan.
   _April. The Joint Chiefs of Staff gives Laird what he wants _
and much of what Thieu is after. The new withdrawal plan gives
Saigon two 175mm artillery battalions and other equipment and
separate ration supplements and dependent housing support for
Thieu's troops.
   With that, the Abrams-Laird struggle over Vietnamization ended.
The withdrawals continued throughout 1971 and 1972 without a break.
   On the diplomatic front, the United States, South Vietnam, North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong signed the Paris Peace Accords on Jan.
27, 1973, removing the one remaining obstacle to total U.S.
withdrawal _ Hanoi's agreement to return American prisoners of war.
The accords called for a cease-fire and set up an international
body to police it, but the agreement was almost immediately
violated and the war resumed.
   By the end of 1973, the U.S. military contingent in Vietnam was
down to 50 men; South Vietnam was left to fight its war alone.
   On Jan. 8, 1975, the North Vietnamese politburo ordered a major
offensive to ``liberate'' South Vietnam by a cross-border invasion.
In March, in the face of the onslaught, Thieu withdrew his army
from the Central Highlands, a move that touched off countrywide
panic.
   The cities of Hue and Danang fell. On April 11-13 the U.S.
Embassy staff was evacuated by helicopter; on April 29, Saigon fell
to the North Vietnamese and the war ended.
   ``Vietnamization was not a stragegy for fighting or winning the
war, or even for achieving America's limited objectives in South
Vietnam,'' concludes Clarke.
   ``At best, it was a political strategy for continuing U.S.
support for a domestically unpopular conflict and, at worst, a
face-saving abandonment of a commitment that American leaders felt
they could or should no longer honor.''
   Says Laird: ``There was no other alternative. We had 570,000 men
on the ground in Vietnam. We had 2 million Air Force and Navy
personnel supporting them. The Congress was fed up with Vietnam and
so were the American people. The lesson from Vietnam should be that
we should follow the advice that President Dwight Eisenhower gave
when the French failed in Vietnam _ never get involved in ground
warfare in Southeast Asia.''

   Compeer. The word means ``equal, companion,
friend, peer.'' It's also the name of an organization that uses
friendship as therapy for the mentally disturbed. The group matches
volunteers with clients for one-on-one get-togethers each week for
a year. While there have been no scientific evaluations of the
program, mental health experts say it does seem to help.

   In 1976, Trudy Pembroke weighed 325 pounds. She
was divorced, unemployable, estranged from her family and confined
to a state hospital in Rochester, N.Y.
   Her grim history included a feeling at age 9 that something was
terribly wrong with her. At that age, she didn't know she was a
victim of severe depression and its devastating consequences. But
she was to learn soon enough.
   She attempted suicide half a dozen times, beginning at age 16.
She was frequently hospitalized for her mental illness.
   She had her stomach stapled to lose weight and was admitted to a
group home. But the demons of overwhelming depression won again.
Her spirit was broken, her fragile self-esteem shattered. She was
hospitalized yet again.
   Life in a state hospital seemed her destiny.
   Now 41, Trudy today weighs 155 pounds. She has her own apartment
with new furniture. She earned an associate degree in college,
bought a new car she calls ``Baby,'' and has a new job.
   She is out of therapy and off all medication.
   Was it a miracle? No, it was nature's medicine _ friendship.
   Janice Wittmershaus, 33, a research physicist, was the friend.
She befriended Trudy until Trudy was well enough to be her own
friend.
   But Janice and Trudy's paths probably would never have crossed
were it not for an unusual non-profit organization called Compeer.
   ``Compeer is the best anti-depressant in the world,'' Trudy says.
   Its premise is simply the power of friendship.
   Headquartered in Rochester, N.Y., Compeer began with 10 patients
and 10 volunteers and was called ``Adopt-A-Patient.'' In 1976,
Bernice Skirboll answered a help-wanted ad and took over.
   She found the name too patronizing and thumbed through her
dictionary. She found ``compeer.'' The definition: ``equal,
companion, friend, peer.''
   In 1977, Skirboll registered the name with the federal
government, began raising money and expanded it to an organization
that has helped more than 10,000 mentally and emotionally
handicapped people in 119 cities in 37 states and Canada.
   The friend, the compeer, contracts to spend one hour a week with
the client for a year. The volunteers undergo brief training. They
meet with a therapist if indicated and submit written monthly
reports.
   Mrs. Skirboll says the backup support for each volunteer costs
about $450 a year, about what it would cost to keep a patient in a
hospital for three days.
   The program exists from Gainesville, Fla., to Portland, Ore.,
from Augusta, Maine, to San Diego, as well as in smaller cities
like Grand Haven, Mich., and Great Bend, Kan. Each has its own
budget, some as high as $150,000, but the national norm is $25,000.
   Trudy decided to go public with her story to try to eradicate
the stigma the mentally ill suffer.
   Her story is that of a product of a broken home, a survivor of
foster homes and a father she could never please.
   ``I could have become president of the United States and it
would not have been good enough for him,'' she says. ``I carried
that attitude into my adult life.''
   She hasn't seen her father or spoken to him or any of her four
sisters in the last 10 years, although they all live within 50
miles. Her mother is dead.
   ``The last time I spoke to him, he said the next thing he wanted
to hear about me was that I was dead,'' Trudy recalls. ``I told him
I would abide by his wishes, but that I still loved him. His voice
cracked a little and he said, `OK. Goodbye.'''
   ``I got married at 20 for all the wrong reasons,'' she says. ``I
didn't love him, but I was fat and ugly and I knew no one else
would ever ask me.'' The marriage lasted eight years.
   By the time Janice met Trudy in 1983, she was living in a
halfway house, but she was thinking of returning to the state
hospital, to the wards she knew all too well.
   Trudy was in the state hospital when she was paired with her
first compeer, a woman who stayed with her for six years, but then
moved from Rochester and they lost touch.
   Bernice arranged for Janice to take over Trudy's case. But after
the second or third visit, Trudy told Janice not to bother to come
back.

   ``I did everything I could to sabotage the relationship,'' Trudy
says. ``I wouldn't talk to her sometimes when she came.'' Other
times, she would just cry, but she couldn't articulate what was
wrong.
   But Janice was as tenacious as Trudy. She just kept coming back.
Eventually, they started going out for coffee, they fed ducks on a
pond, they went window-shopping, they went to the circus, to movies.
   ``I finally started talking a little bit,'' Trudy recalls. ``I
would ask her why she would want to come and see me. Why should
anyone care about me? She showed me what a true friend is. Since
Janice, I know what a relationship is.''
   Trudy wanted to return to the hospital. She felt she couldn't
make it on the outside. Janice kept saying, ``Yes, you can,'' words
that eventually Trudy came to believe.
   When Trudy started college, as Janice was studying for her
master's degree, they would often study together.
   After Trudy got her degree, she had about 35 interviews before
she finally got a job.
   After she had been with Trudy for three years, Janice's husband
left the University of Rochester for a job in Phoenix. But Janet
and Trudy's friendship, while no longer an official compeer match,
has survived.
   Janice calls Trudy about twice a month and Trudy writes to her.
Last year for her birthday, Janice and her husband sent Trudy a
round-trip ticket to spend two weeks with them in Phoenix.
   Trudy no longer has, or needs, an official compeer. She has made
a few friends on her own, always with Janice's encouragement.
   Trudy, blessed with a gift for public speaking, volunteers as a
speaker for Compeer. She tells her audience she is going to talk
about a mentally ill person. She then gives her own life story.
   Compeer has become more sophisticated than it was in the early
days and tries to match people with something in common. Janice and
Trudy really had nothing in common, but one example in Harlem
reflects the extent to which Compeer now tries to make these
friendship dates work.
   Both the volunteer and the client were originally from Jamaica
and both very interested in music, especially reggae, the music of
the island. And so John Bent, 39, a victim of schizophrenia, became
the friend of Howard Clarke, 22, a senior at Lehman College.
   The Rev. Robert Smalls of the Macedonia Baptist Church and the
Compeer director at the Upper Manhattan Mental Health Clinic
brought the two together about four months ago.
   Bent, whose disease dates back to his student days in
Manchester, England, has very few friends and is frightened to
leave the house. The voices that bedevil him, despite medication,
get louder, the hallucinations become three dimensional. If he is
with someone, however, it is easier.
   Clarke brings records and videos to the four-story walk-up Bent
shares with his wife and five children.
   Despite the age difference, both are students in their own way.
On one of their recent visits, Clarke asked if Bent knew anything
about the Dutch philosopher Spinoza, the subject of one of his
classes that afternoon. It turned out he did. So instead of
listening to music as usual, the two chatted about philosophy.
   Neal Brown, director of community support for the National
Institutes of Mental Health in Rockville, Md., says Compeer ``seems
to be very effective.''
   ``Everybody who has been involved with them has nothing to say
but good about them,'' says Brown. He adds, however, there has not
been an objective and scientific evaluation of the program.
   The studies in Rochester, where the program began, indicate
Compeer significantly cuts the rate of a patient's re-entry to an
institution.
   Sixty percent of previously hospitalized patients return at some
point, according to mental health professionals. Among the Compeer
clients, that number has dropped to 15 percent, Skirboll says.
   Although Compeer gets some government money, it also gets
donations from such corporations as Xerox, Citibank, Eastman Kodak,
Honeywell, AT&amp;T, General Motors and Merrill Lynch.
   Dr. Martin Von Holden, executive director of Rochester
Psychiatric Center, says he has 80 Compeer volunteers working in
the hospital, a facility with 500 patients and 200 outpatients.
   ``It's a wonderful way to transition a patient from the hospital
to a halfway house or group home,'' Von Holden says.

   A new high school soon to open in the suburbs of
New York City reflects the growing Japanese presence in America.
The aim of the school is to prepare Japanese children for college
back in their home country. There are some decided differences in
the way students are drilled in Japan and the United States.

   East will meet West on the campus of Keio
High School, an experimental academy that will teach the children
of Japanese executives posted in America.
   The school, on the grounds of Manhattanville College in this
suburb of New York City, is scheduled to open in September 1990.
Construction of a classroom and administrative building, a
gymnasium, cafeteria and dormitories began in the fall.
   Keio was conceived as a way to attract Japanese businesses to
New York state. But it is now seen as an important educational
effort in its own right _ an experiment in bilingual, bicultural
education that could help expand the horizons of education in Japan
and in the United States.
   ``The school is a bellwether for the state, if not the
country,'' says J. Edward Meyer, the regional representative on the
New York Board of Regents, the state's educational policy board.
``It could become an instant model.''
   The catalyst for the creation of the school was concern about
the education of the children of the growing number of Japanese
businessmen who work in America. An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 live
in the Northeast alone, the most in any area of North America.
   Yasumitsu Nihei, who will be principal of the new school, says
the average stay of the Japanese businessman once was about five
years. But now they're staying longer, and the needs of their
college-bound children are more important.
   Most Japanese children want to attend a university in their
homeland ``to be mainstream in Japan,'' says Nihei. In many cases,
workers stay with a single company all their lives, and to get into
that company they must get into the right school, he says.
   But to get into the university, students must pass an
examination. All of their previous education from the second grade
on is geared toward drilling them with the facts necessary to pass
that test. They attend school eight hours a day, 5{ days a week,
240 days a year.
   By comparison, American students attend six hours a day, five
days a week for about 180 days a year. And American schools
concentrate less on the rote memorization that is commonplace at
Japanese schools.
   There is an elementary school based on the Japanese system in
New York City. But until recently, high school students often were
sent home to Japan.
   The Meiji Gakuin University of Tokyo plans to open a traditional
Japanese high school in Sweetwater, Tenn., where 70 Japanese-owned
companies, including Nissan, Sharp and Matsushita, have operations.
   Meanwhile, Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Gov. Mario Cuomo, said
New York's Department of Economic Development had seized on the
establishment of a school to help Japanese businessmen already here
and attract more.
   Tokyo's prestigious Keio University was consulted. Matilda
Cuomo, the governor's wife, even visited the university during
negotiations.
   They settled on Manhattanville as the site of the new school
because it was close to New York City and because Manhattanville
has a sister school in Japan, the University of the Sacred Heart.
   Half the faculty in the new school will be American and the
curriculum will cull the best from the American school system,
particularly an emphasis on writing, which is more American than
Japanese.
   The curriculum will meet graduation requirements of both New
York and Japan and an outstanding student at the school would be
assured entry into Keio University without the dreaded exam.
   While it is expected that Japanese students will make up most of
the student body, American students will not be excluded.
   Entrance into the school will be based on an exam, grades,
bilingual ability demonstrated in written essays, letters of
recommendation and extracurricular activities.
   The school will operate on two semesters and will accommodate
both the Japanese school year, which runs April to March, and the
U.S. school year. Tuition is projected at $12,000 a year, room and
board at $4,000.
   Manhattanville President Marcia Savage said students from her
school will student-teach at the school or work in labs there.
   Dr. Paul Valenti, superintendent of Harrison schools, is also
looking forward to a partnership with his Asian neighbor.
   In his district, 6.7 percent of the district's 2,166 students
are Asian, mostly Japanese, but only 24 students in the Harrison
high school system are Asian.
   Harrison currently offers a bilingual program for Japanese
students at its Parsons Elementary School.
   ``It's an opportunity for us to share programs, for both of us
to learn,'' Valenti says. ``Some of our Japanese students prefer
the American experience and want to go to an American University.''
   Keio University, which is investing $40 million in the school,
including $9.5 million to buy 27 acres of the Manhattanville
campus, feels the experiment could pay dividends at home.
   ``Japan is in an age of internationalization,'' says Nihei, who
hopes the school's success will lead to similar programs elsewhere
in the United States.

   The Wagner family of Shiner, Texas, is health
conscious in a big way. Three Wagner brothers, following in their
father's footsteps, became the town's only doctors, and five of
their sons are on their way to becoming physicians. That's not to
mention the female side of the family, which includes a nurse, a
dietician and a respiratory therapist.

   There's Dr. Bob and Dr. Dennis, as they are
known around town. And don't forget their brother, Dr. Pat, who
just retired.
   Then there are those soon-to-be doctors, Ralph, Timothy, Thomas
and Ted, Dennis Wagner's grown sons. And Pat's youngest son, Jason,
a pre-med student.
   ``It's kind of contagious,'' says Dr. Bob Wagner about what is,
in every sense, a family practice.
   Since the early 1970s, Bob Wagner and his younger brothers,
Dennis and Pat, have been the only physicians in this town, best
known for its beer brewery.
   Practicing medicine in a small town is not easy. But the Wagner
clan loves it.
   ``People say thank you,'' Bob Wagner says. ``You get a lot of
gifts. You get a lot of food. You get turkeys and chickens and pies
and cakes.
   ``To me, somebody that's going to go out of their way to pay for
a service and then ante up something ... That's very gratifying.''
   The 2,000 townspeople in Shiner have depended on the Wagners for
everything from surgery to treating the flu to delivering babies.
   The Wagners have delivered an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 babies,
Bob says.
   Pat, 54, retired last year for health reasons. Now Bob, 63, and
Dennis, 59, keep the medical practice going, attending to 40
patients a day and taking turns treating the sick and doing
emergency room shifts at a nearby community hospital.
   Most patients visit the Wagners' clinic for appointments, but
the doctors still do what most physicians gave up years ago. They
make house calls.
   ``We stay very, very busy,'' Bob says.
   Their bustling office in downtown Shiner is housed in an old
school building.
   In the waiting room is a portrait of the man who started it all:
Frank Wagner, the father of Bob, Pat and Dennis. He was _ not
surprisingly _ a doctor.
   Pat recalls local residents contacted his father at all times of
the day and night for medical care, and his father always responded.
   ``He went to Mass and Communion every day. When he lost a
patient he would almost lose his mind,'' Pat recalls. ``I guess we
just had a real good man to identify with.''
   Even though he was deeply devoted to Roman Catholicism, Frank
Wagner was known to respect the beliefs of others.
   ``He would always prescribe wine for the Baptists and
Methodists,'' Bob says, with a smile. ``They went right along with
it _ for medicinal purposes.''
   Frank Wagner was so special in town that the local hospital was
named for him.
   His sons lament the hospital was forced to close last year after
struggling to survive. Its beds didn't remain full, and it fell
prey to today's Medicare reimbursement system that pays a set
amount for a diagnosis, no matter the cost of the service.
   Now Bob and Dennis travel to Yoakum Community Hospital about 10
miles from Shiner to care for patients.
   The brothers are trying to recruit a new doctor for their
practice. Then Bob will consider retiring, he says. But trying to
get a young physician to come to a small town isn't easy.
   ``The ones who like to hunt and fish and drive a tractor on
their days off will come on down,'' Bob says.
   But the three Wagners returned to their hometown, even after
studying medicine at prestigious Texas medical schools. More
Wagners are starting to follow in their footsteps.
   Dennis says he never encouraged his four sons to go to medical
school. In fact, he says, ``I tried to discourage them from going
into medicine, but to no avail.''
   Now Ralph is completing his residency in Waco, and Timothy, Ted
and Thomas are in medical school in Houston. Pat's son, Jason, is
studying pre-med at Notre Dame.
   The Wagner family's interest in health care doesn't end there.
Pat's wife is a dietician, a daughter is a nurse and another
daughter is a respiratory therapist.
   A sister of the Wagner brothers has eight children, and two of
them are doctors.

   It's hard to imagine devoting one's life to
penetrating the forbidding walls of a prison and trying to reach

   ``People think these boys are just
throwaways, that they're getting what they deserve. I think the
public needs to know that God is behind prison walls.''
   That's the feeling of Gloria Simmons, who with accordion and
Bible in hand walks through prison doors each Sunday to try to
inspire even the most hardened inmates.
   In a drafty room once used as a barracks for prisoners, the spry
grandmother of two stands before about 100 uniformed inmates at
Camp Sauble, the state's only boot-camp-style corrections facility.
   ``My heart is behind the prison doors with you,'' she says to
the men, most of them repeat offenders under age 25.
   After having former drill instructors bark orders in their face
all week, many of the young men crack a smile for the first time
since the previous Sunday.
   ``When I first came here, I didn't want to go to church
services,'' says inmate Christopher Parker, 19, of Dowagiac, who
was sent to Camp Sauble on a breaking and entering conviction.
``But when you see her, it brings your spirits up and makes you
feel better for the rest of the week.''
   ``I'm glad my Mom made me take accordion lessons, because it's
opened quite a lot of prison doors,'' Simmons says with a chuckle.
   One of her hymns she wrote herself, and it sums up her message:
``I am me and I am good cuz God don't make junk.''
   Simmons began her mostly musical church services at Camp Sauble
in 1984, two years after she took early retirement from a 17-year
career as a case worker with the Michigan Department of Social
Services.
   When she's not at Camp Sauble on Sunday, Simmons can be found at
other Michigan prisons. She plays monthly at the minimum-security
prison at Cassidy Lake near Ann Arbor and at the Kinross
medium-security facility in the Upper Peninsula.
   She's also a regular visitor at several other prisons, including
camps Cusino and Ojibway in the Upper Peninsula and camps Pellston,
Pugsley and Waterloo in the Lower Peninsula.
   Attendance at Simmons' services usually runs a remarkable 98
percent, compared with about 10 percent at most prisons across the
state, officials say. Those who choose not to attend must stay in
their cells for ``quiet time.'' Most weeks, the only inmates not in
attendance are those who are banned as punishment, guards say.
   Prison officials say Simmons' services seem to touch many of the
inmates.
   ``They really put their heart and soul in the services,'' says
Officer John Hawkins. ``That Sunday service gives them the drive to
complete the week.''
   Accompanied by her brother on the banjo, Simmons' songs are
upbeat, an inspiration to the offenders who have been given 90 days
to change their ways. If they fail, they are sent to a conventional
prison, usually with a much longer sentence.
   There are the traditional hymns, such as ``Amazing Grace,'' and
within a few minutes, nearly every one of the men is clapping and
singing along in thunderous voices as Simmons belts out the tunes
on her accordion. After every song they roar their approval.
   A brief Christian service follows. Inmates read along with their
donated Bibles and bow their shaved heads in prayer. A guard
patrols the room.
   Simmons' musical prowess also includes the piano, organ and
guitar. In her 20s, she sang in an all-girl dance band in Lansing,
where she grew up.
   Besides her commitment to people behind bars, Simmons deviates
from the stereotypical grandmother image in other ways. She
recently sold her motorcycle, which had earned her the nickname
``Motorcycle Mama'' among friends. ``I never had the time to ride
it,'' she says.
   Simmons' first prison performance came when a fellow male member
at her Assembly of God church who had been playing guitar for
inmates at Camp Sauble _ then a regular minimum-security prison _
asked her to fill in one Sunday.
   ``It became an addiction,'' she says.
   She also began teaching Bible class at the prison every Tuesday.
It was at those Bible classes, which eventually grew to 40
students, that she cultivated friendships with about 20 prisoners.
When they were transferred to other state prisons in early 1988 to
make room for the boot camp, Simmons began corresponding and
visiting them all over the state.
   ``They became like family,'' she says. ``Some of them have no
visitors but me.'' Many have sent her paintings and small,
prison-made artifacts.
   Only about five of the original 20 men remain behind bars, and
many stopped corresponding upon their release, Simmons says.
   ``That doesn't bother me. I had a part of their life while they
were here, but they want to put their past behind them when they
get out.''
   Simmons doesn't get any money for her prison work, but
emphasizes that she doesn't do it for recognition, monetary or
otherwise.
   ``Money would never equal what I get back from these boys,'' she
says.

   ``I rather specialize in old men.''
   So confesses author John Mortimer, whose fifth ``Rumpole of the
Bailey'' series, starring Leo McKern, is running on PBS'
``Mystery,'' and who has a four-part play starring 86-year-old John
Gielgud running on British TV.
   The six Rumpole episodes, each a separate story, began Dec. 7.
``Summer's Lease,'' starring Gielgud, will come to America in the
spring.
   Mortimer retired from practicing law six years ago and doesn't
miss it. Now 66, he continues his other career as a writer. With
six more Rumpole tales ready to be filmed next April, he has
written more about Rumpole than any other character.
   ``I think my writing has got funnier,'' Mortimer says. ``The
last three Rumpole series were written when I wasn't a barrister
any more. I can see the law as funnier when I'm not doing it all
the time.''
   Rumpole is a favorite of ``Mystery'' viewers.
   He calls himself an Old Bailey hack. He takes cases that start
fairly grungy and descend to fairly hopeless. He drinks Chateau
Thames Embankment at Pommeroy's Wine Bar, spouts literary
quotations and witticisms, duels verbally with a wife he calls She
Who Must Be Obeyed, and thinks.
   Everybody from the head of his law chambers to the clerk takes a
dim view of Rumpole's chances in court. Though he usually makes a
brilliant deduction that wins the day, Rumpole is perceived as
muddling through.
   Rumpole is real to Mortimer but not necessarily the most real of
his creations.
   ``The man in `Summer's Lease,' Dodds, the old father, does have
a life of his own. He comes bopping in and does his stuff. It's
what good characters do,'' Mortimer says.
   ``He's played by Gielgud in the TV version of it. It's going to
come to America in April or May on `Masterpiece Theater.' Its four
episodes are a huge success in England.
   ``Dodds had to be played by a great big star. Gielgud
immediately wanted to do it. He's bright as a bee. He has had the
most marvelous notices with this part.''
   In the Rumpole stories, Mortimer says, ``There are always three
plots: the plot of the case, which is the least important one; his
life at home; and his life in chambers. I've always found if you do
an hour's TV, what makes it rich is having a lot of stories going
on at the same time. And it's more interesting to do.
   ``Usually I write the TV scripts first. They don't come out for
nine months. During that time I write the book, so that the book
can come out at the time of the TV show.''
   The paperback ``Rumpole and the Age of Miracles'' contains
Rumpole's adventures in the present series.
   ``I do take a lot of trouble not to make the stories look as if
they were novelizations of scripts,'' Mortimer says. ``I don't just
put `he said' and `she said' into it. I try to write it as though
it's a work of prose fiction to begin with.''
   Mortimer wrote ``Charade,'' his first novel, in 1946, putting in
his experiences in a World War II film unit.
   ``I wrote six novels. `The Narrowing Stream' was about 1954.
Then I wrote `Dock Brief,' which was a radio play.
   ``I gave up writing novels partly because I got into the theater
and partly because I was married to a novelist, Penelope Mortimer,
who wrote `The Pumpkin Eater.' It didn't seem to be right to have
two novelists in the family. I'm not married to her anymore.''
   Three of those early novels have recently been reprinted.
   Mortimer's ``Paradise Postponed'' was seen on TV in America in
1986. It's the result of his being asked to write a 13-part TV
series about England since World War II.
   ``I thought I'd write the novel at the same time,'' he says. ``I
was writing like it was a lot of TV scripts. I had to start again.
I hadn't written a novel in 30 years. In novels you have to write
scenes.''
   Mortimer has just finished a sequel called ``Titmuss Regained,''
which will be published as a book next spring.
   ``It's about the concreting over of the south of England,
building a new town and destroying the countryside,'' he says.
   Britain's politics bemuses Mortimer.
   He says Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's great achievement is
``to have taken the Conservative Party away from the upper class
and given it to the up-and-thrusting lower middle class. It's much
more ruthless than the old upper-class conservatism. Old country
gents were quite keen on looking after the people on the estate,
bringing them blankets and boxes of tea. The new type of
conservatism is just everybody for themselves.''

   Geraldine James had doubts about acting in ``The
Merchant of Venice'' until she learned that her co-star was Dustin
Hoffman.
   ``When I knew who was playing Shylock, I became rather keen to
do it, unsurprisingly,'' says the 39-year-old English actress,
fresh from a sellout London run as Portia to Hoffman's Jewish
moneylender in Shakespeare's dark comedy of caskets, the law and
revenge.
   The production, directed by Sir Peter Hall, marked Hoffman's
British and Shakespearean stage debut and packed London's Phoenix
Theater for 18 weeks.
   The play is now on view at Broadway's 46th St. Theater for a
limited engagement through Feb. 24. It gives Americans the
opportunity to see a two-time Oscar-winner tackle Shakespeare in a
performance which, James says, changed nightly in London.
   ``To do the trial scene, I used to walk on every day not knowing
what was going to happen,'' she says, referring to Portia's
fourth-act encounter with Shylock, the beleaguered and vengeful
moneylender who meets his match in the heiress, Portia.
   ``When Dustin was truthful, even if he took choices that were
wrong, he was always brilliant _ so riveting and unexpected,'' she
says.
   ``I felt very protective of him ... The whole company as a
company was so proud to be working with him. He was so generous,
spiritually and literally. He wouldn't have his name over the
title, and insisted on me having the last curtain call.''
   James used a six-week break before New York rehearsals to
regather her artistic strength.
   ``We don't ask opera singers to do Wagner eight times a week,
and honestly, I am exhausted,'' she says. ``Portia is a very big,
quite tiring part.''
   The blonde, big-boned actress is best-known to American
audiences for her portrayal of Mirabehn, Mahatma Gandhi's acolyte
in the Oscar-winning movie about the Indian leader's life, and as
Sarah Layton, the India-born daughter of a British colonel, in the
1984 TV miniseries ``The Jewel in the Crown.''
   James' first experience in ``Merchant'' came while playing
Jessica, Shylock's daughter, in a provincial production 10 years
ago in the English midlands city of Coventry.
   Then, she recalls, Portia struck her as ``a bit of a know-all.''
Now, she finds her ``a miraculous character,'' and attributes her
shift in perceptions to Hall's direction.
   ``With Shakespeare, he is the master, he can tell you how to do
it,'' James says. ``If I was going to see Shakespeare for the first
time, I would choose a Peter Hall production. He may not go for
innovation, but he does the play.''
   Hall says he admired James's ``natural musicality and sense of
rhythm ... She'sa very intelligent, feisty actress.''
   James says the director encouraged her to explore the
contradictions of a character who can seem dismissive and even
racist one minute, ripe with ``the quality of mercy'' _ in
Shakespeare's celebrated phrase _ the next.
   ``It's tempting to iron those contradictions out so that
characters become one-dimensional in order to become
recognizable,'' James says. ``As actors we always want to be liked;
it's much braver to dare to be disliked.''
   She says Portia's complexities ``are part of her interest.''
   ``People say, `How can someone be as nice and as nasty as
Portia?' But we're very often like that,'' James says. ``It's much
too simple to say Portia's any one thing, because she's all of them.
   ``It's important to win an audience around through convincing
them of the truth of the character.''
   ``Merchant'' reunited James with Hall, who directed her as
Imogen in Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline'' last year at the National
Theater. She replaced Sarah Miles just three weeks before the first
preview of Shakespeare's sprawling, rarely performed late romance.
   ``It was wonderful doing `Cymbeline' knowing people didn't know
it at all,'' she says. ``Those who came discovered the play.''
   She also starred in Hall's first film in 15 years, ``She's Been
Away,'' as the self-destructive banker's wife. She and co-star Dame
Peggy Ashcroft shared the best actress prize at the Venice Film
Festival in September.
   ``I had worked with Peter; Peggy had worked with Peter; I had
worked with Peggy,'' James says. ``A lot of things about it made
sense.''
   She and the legendary Ashcroft, now 81, co-starred in ``The
Jewel in the Crown,'' about the end of British rule in India.
   And the afterglow lingers on: ``I get letters still from
America. They have `Jewel in the Crown' evenings, watching it on
video, eating curries and wearing saris.''
   Her training, typical of many English performers, was in the
theater. She studied at the Drama Center and did a stint as a
dresser with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which was then
presenting Ashcroft in Edward Albee's ``A Delicate Balance.''
   Years in regional repertory theaters led to the London
``fringe'' and on to the commercial West End, where she starred
opposite Julie Walters in ``When I Was a Girl, I Used To Scream and
Shout.''
   Her first major screen part was in ``Gandhi.'' Earlier this
year, she appeared with Jeff Goldblum in a new film comedy, ``The
Tall Guy.'' Neither that film nor ``She's Been Away'' has yet been
released in the United States.
   James will be seen later this year on-screen in ``The Wolves of
Willoughby Chase,'' starring Stephanie Beacham from ``The Colbys''
and ``Dynasty.''
   Next year, she and Ben Kingsley, her ``Gandhi'' co-star, re-team
for a two-character play, Lanford Wilson's ``A Betrothal,'' which
they first performed above a London pub three years ago.
   James was born in Berkshire, west of London, one of three
children and the daughter of a cardiologist. The product of ``a
typical middle-class family,'' she says she became an actress more
or less against the wishes of her parents.
   ``But if the spirits want you to be something, you be it,'' she
says.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `She-Devil'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``She-Devil'' is a revenge movie without Sly, Clint, Arnold or
Chuck. This time it's Roseanne Barr who shows those vengeful gents
the kind of hell that a scorned woman can administer.
   Barr is the dull, slovenly, accident-prone wife of Ed Begley
Jr., an ambitious New York accountant with amazing tolerance for
her many failings. They include running their suburban home like a
city slum and mismanaging their two overbearing children.
   When the couple attends a gallery opening in Manhattan, he falls
into the clutches of a man-hungry, self-adoring writer of romance
novels, Meryl Streep. Weary of her live-in gigolo, she decides to
give the accountant her business and her love.
   Barr slowly realizes her husband has been led astray. She boils
with Mephistophelean wrath, vowing to rob him of everything he
holds dear: his family life, his career, his new love, his freedom.
Her methods are as far-fetched as they are hilarious.
   Full-out farce such as ``She-Devil'' requires a feathery
directorial touch and the most delicate of playing. Susan
Seidelman's direction is on target most of the way, maintaining a
whirlwind pace that forestalls suspension of belief. The script by
Mark R. Burns and Barry Strugatz is cleverly constructed, though
some of the comedy is misdirected (example: the spoofing of
senility in a retirement sanitarium).
   The movie is based on the novel, ``The Life and Loves of a
She-Devil,'' by Fay Weldon. Set in Britain, the novel was made into
a critically acclaimed TV miniseries telecast by PBS.
   The big news in ``She-Devil'' is Streep's emergence as a
world-class comedy actress. She attacks the role of the vain,
foolish novelist with a skilled gusto that invites comparison to
the great Lucille Ball. Streep is delicious in her cunning
calculation and convulsively funny when her champagne world loses
its fizz.
   Another revelation is Ed Begley Jr., heretofore known for expert
character roles in films (``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Scenes
From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'') and as the
self-centered doctor of television's ``St. Elsewhere.'' Tall and
clunky with unruly straw-colored hair, he is the ideal foil for the
marvelous Streep.
   ``She-Devil'' marks Barr's film debut following her rapid rise
as a standup comedian and television star. It would be nice to
report that she scores another triumph. Alas, she seems uneasy and
tentative in her role as the vindictive wife, as if wondering where
the jokes are. With more expert handling, she can undoubtedly

   ``How I Got Into College'' (CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated PG-13.)
   
   Marlon Brown, a rather dim high school student who bombs out on
his SATs, nevertheless sets his sights on getting into selective
Ramsey College to be near the girl he loves from afar, Jessica
Kailo _ scholar, cheerleader and class president.
   Will Marlon (Corey Parker) get into Ramsey? Will he win the girl
of his dreams? Will Jessica (Lara Flynn Boyle) get into Ramsey?
   A high school guidance counselor might call ``How I Got Into
College'' an underachiever.
   Consider the potential for a movie about getting into college _
the terror of taking the SATs, confusion over where to apply, the
dreaded college interview, the agonizing wait for word of whether
you've been admitted or rejected. ``How I Got Into College,'' a
comedy, tries to take on all this, but does it with little humor,
drama or insight.
   It has some clever spots _ a shady SAT coaching service; a
mailman bringing a letter with a demonic grin; students phoning
home frantically to find out whether they've received a fat letter
(an acceptance) or a thin one (a rejection).
   But the movie often substitutes offbeat camera angles for humor,
and the odd-couple romance isn't particularly compelling. By the
end, it's clear Marlon has more to offer than we thought. But not
much more.
   Send ``How I Got Into College'' a thin letter.

   ``Badge of the Assassin'' (Vidmark. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)
   
   Why would anyone want to spend $90 for a made-for-television
movie that has had its share of reruns since 1985? Video companies
seem to think consumers are either dumb or so hungry for movies
they'll buy anything.
   ``Badge of the Assassin'' is actually a fairly good cop and
court room drama about the conviction of Black Liberation Army
members who murdered two police officers in New York City in the
early 1970s. It stars Yaphet Kotto as the investigating detective
who must walk a thin line, and James Woods as the young and
crusading assistant district attorney who prosecutes the black
radicals.
   But despite excellent acting, the pacing is slow and the overall
feel of the movie is television tepid. The hard edge that could and
should be there is missing.
   ``Under the Biltmore Clock,'' from Nelson for $79.98, is another
leftover from television. This time it's the jazz age as seen
through Sean Young. You can miss it.

   Lute Suites, by Johann Sebastian Bach (London) _ Eduardo
Fernandez, guitar
   Compact disc enemies now have some new ammunition. This
recording not only reproduces Fernandez's sound in crystal, it also
captures to a distracting degree the clicking, zinging sounds of
the mechanics of playing his instrument.
   Aside from the the suites, this two-disc set offers
transcriptions of assorted Bach works for violin and harpsichord,
confined to a second disc timed at a pitiful 44.59.
   Fernandez is also a little ungenerous musically. His techically
fine playing sounds not especially sensitive, on this recording at
least. Lines are not well shaped and don't always emerge
independently, and the phrasing sometimes sounds rushed.

   ``Deaf, Dumb, and Blonde'' (Sire) _ Deborah Harry
   
   ``Deaf, Dumb and Blonde'' is Deborah Harry's third solo effort
since the breakup of the punk bastion Blondie.
   Unfortunately, Harry has locked into today's pop format and the
album lacks her snarling early 1980s cleverness.
   Two of the tracks, including the lead single, ``I Want That
Man,'' were written by Allanah Currie and Tom Bailey of the
Thompson Twins, and their influence permeates most of the record in
the form of snappy beats and almost mundane lyrics.
   On the few songs Harry wrote with ex-boyfriend Chris Stein, the
dark, brooding punk attitudes return. Harry's self-confident lyrics
and Stein's menacing guitar combine on several notable tracks.
   ``Lovelight,'' a duet with Ian Astbury of The Cult, mixes
paradoxical imagery with Indian rhythms to tell of love in a
cryptic, mystical setting. ``Calmarie,'' which Harry sings partly
in Spanish, is a lovely showcase for the higher register of her
voice.
   ``Brite Side'' produces a more tender side. She is confident,
but not arrogant; loving, but not worshiping.
   You have to wait for most of the record for a real knockout.
That comes with the last track, the gorgeously arranged ``End of
the Run.'' It is a partly spoken song-poem that tells of Harry's
beginnings: ``when a torn T-shirt made it all dangerous.'' In it,
she says she ``doesn't like flashbacks in movies ... I like the
story to proceed.''
   Harry's story has proceeded, but into what's threatening to look
like pop dribble. She's called her new music ``simpler and more
aggressive.'' Simpler, yes. More agressive, no.

   The Dallas Museum of Art has put together a major traveling
exhibit of more than 150 works by 49 black artists of the 20th
century.
   ``Black Art-Ancestral Legacy: The African Impulse in
African-American Art'' opened Dec. 3 and will run through Feb. 25
before moving on to the High Musuem in Atlanta, the Milwaukee Art
Museum and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.
   The importance of African cultural traditions to the creativity
of black artists in the United States, Jamaica, Haiti and the
Bahamas is the focus of the exhibit.
   ``Unlike the American and European modernists who borrowed the
forms of `primitive' African sculpture early in the 20th century,
African-American artists tapped into the wellspring of their
ancestral art to produce a new synthesis of the African and the
American,'' said Richard R. Bretell, director of the museum.
   ``When an African-American artist makes use of snake imagery, of
woven patterns, or of repetititve images derived from dance, he is
not merely `borrowing' forms, but making a powerful statement about
cultural continuity.''
   The exhibit features works by such artists as Richmond Barthe,
Xenobia Bailey, Sargent Johnson, Ed Love, John Biggers and Derek
Webster.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Chase Takes Charge of His Career</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA1 of Dec. 4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a dozen years in movies, Chevy Chase
can still take a tumble to get a laugh, but he is learning not to
risk career falls because of bad advice.
   The lesson hasn't come easily for the tall, preppie-looking
comedian. After creating a falling-down sensation on ``Saturday
Night Live,'' he made an impressive film debut in ``Foul Play'' and
followed with big-money hits such as ``Caddyshack,'' ``National
Lampoon's Vacation'' and ``Fletch.'' But along the way he
encountered films that might have submerged a less durable
performer: ``Under the Rainbow,'' ``Oh! Heavenly Dog,'' ``Modern
Problems,'' ``The Deal of the Century.''
   Despite such disasters, Chase has survived and reportedly draws
$5 million per movie. His latest is ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,'' which reunites him with ``Vacation'' buddies Beverly
D'Angelo and Randy Quaid.
   Chase has finally reached a point where he decided he had to
take charge of his own career.
   ``I don't think there's a star around who doesn't feel that
way,'' he reflected. ``The problem with that is that it can become
too egotistical, too warped by your own lack of introspection and
perspective.
   ``The world is different (when you're a star). It behaves
differently towards you. You're no longer just like anybody else
around you. You have to remember there's such a thing as compromise
and collaboration. On top of that, of all the arts that I'm
familiar with, film is the most collaborative.
   ``I was reading an article about Bill Friedkin (`The Exorcist')
the other day. He said, `I don't consider myself any more or less
important than a crew member.' We all know that's not true of Bill.
We know that he would like to think that and that he means it. The
fact is that his ego takes over, and he gets crazy. He's also a
brilliant director.''
   Chase cited last year's ``Fletch Lives'' as evidence of why he
needs to make his own decisions.
   ``Quite frankly, I had a lot of trepidation about the `Fletch'
sequel. It was in the middle of the writers' strike. I was the only
one who kept saying, `No, it's not gonna work, it's not happening.'
... Everybody at Universal: `It's going to be great, don't worry.'
Me: `No, it's not working.
   ``I hate that. And yet I go along with it. It ends up with me
putting on a lot of funny faces and trying to mug my way through a
picture. It worked for what it was. But I didn't think it was a
good picture. Then I have to go out on a junket and promote it, the
whole time feeling bad about it.''
   Chase doesn't feel that way about ``Christmas Vacation.''
   ``I think it can stand on its own as a picture,'' he said.
``It's got a lot of the richness of the first `Vacation,' if you
can call that stuff rich. It's written by John Hughes, as the first
one was. ... It's directed by a very talented young director named
Jeremiah Chechik, who's got a great eye and a lot of warmth.
   ``And it's very physical, more physical in the Buster Keaton
tradition than I've ever done before. I love that stuff.''
   Chase said he participated in all the production decisions, from
the first meeting with executives from Warner Bros. until the final
print. If he is so gung-ho on control, why doesn't he direct his
own films, like Clint Eastwood and Eddie Murphy?
   ``Clint's children are grown up; Eddie doesn't have any,'' he
pointed out. ``I'm not prepared to take myself away from my family
for the amount of time (needed to direct a film). I try to be as
much a part of the directing process as I can, without being away
from my family.
   ``It's hard enough to be the star and see your family during
that three-month production period. If you direct a movie, you're
looking at a year. This is a very important, precious period in my
kids' lives,'' he said.
   Chase has three children. ``They are from one to six years old,
and a five-year-old. They need the accessibility of their dad, as
well as their mom. The fact is, I need it, too.''
   His resolve may stem from his own childhood: ``I came from a
divorced family, and that was very tough. I think it has affected
me all my life. I think it affects anyone whose parents are
divorced. I don't like it, I don't like to see it happen. It's hard
on the kids.''
   He was born into a wealthy New York family on Oct. 8, 1943, and
named Cornelius Crane Chase (his grandmother provided the Chevy,
perhaps after the Washington suburb). An expensive education
provided a bachelor of arts degree in English and a determination
to perform. After writing for Mad magazine and the Smothers
Brothers, he fell in with the National Lampoon people and ended up
in the first cast of ``Saturday Night Live.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Through the Lens of Eudora Welty</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto JX1 of Dec. 4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY EYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the Great Depression, Eudora Welty
captured the many guises of poverty through her camera's lens.
   And despite the despair, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author found
a natural joy as Mississipians washed laundry by hand, tended a
bootleg still or slaughtered hogs.
   Unlike other photographers who chronicled the era, such as
Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange who intentionally illustrated the
pain and bitterness of the period, Welty's photographs aren't a
misery index of any sort. The Southern writer found almost
universally pleasant emotions in her unposed subjects.
   Her 1930s photographs _ taken as she traveled Mississippi as a
publicity agent for President Roosevelt's Works Progress
Administration _ provide solid evidence of the joy and pride she
saw among even the most poverty-stricken residents of the nation's
poorest state.
   Welty, 80, says her favorite face is that of a middle-age woman
standing with hands at her side in a tattered sweater. The portrait
is the first to appear in both of Welty's photography books.
   ``It shows such a marvelous character,'' she said. ``These were
taken in the Depression when everybody had absolutely nothing. And
she looked so valiant and courageous, dignified and completely
self-possessed while she was so poor _ and in an old sweater full
of holes.''
   ``One Time, One Place,'' a book of 100 black-and-white
photographs published in 1971 by Random House, focused exclusively
on Welty's Depression era pictures.
   Her new book, ``Eudora Welty Photographs,'' recently published
by the University Press of Mississippi, features 226
black-and-white images _ many included in the first book. They
extend into the '50s and across the globe. However, the '30s
photographs of poor Mississippians still dominate in both quantity
and quality.
   Other photographs include architecture of the South and other
American and foreign regions Welty has visited and portraits of
such writers, painters, musicians and sculptors as Katherine Anne
Porter, V.S. Pritchett, Elizabeth Bowen, Eddy Sackville-West,
Lehman Engel, Hubert Creekmore and Jose de Creeft.
   Welty, author of ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and
``The Optimist's Daughter,'' for which she won the Pulitzer in
1972, said it was fiction that provided her with the most
productive tool for dissecting every dimension of a human
personality.
   But in her Depression-era photography, she hopes viewers
concentrate on the faces of her subjects and not just the
overwhelming poverty. ``I think they need to see the face in the
midst of the poverty _ see the situation in reality and yet see the
character, the human being,'' she said.
   ``Eudora Welty Photographs'' sells for $49.95. It includes a
six-page foreward by novelist Reynolds Price and a 16-page
question-and-answer interview with Welty on when, why and how she
took the photographs. The interview was conducted by Hunter Cole
and Seetha Srinivasan of the University Press of Mississippi.
   Welty insists she isn't a photographer and a review of the
technical quality of her work will miss her point altogether. She
calls her pictures ``snapshots,'' a kind of community ``family
album.'' She used a simple Eastman Kodak with bellows at first, and
later a more sophisticated Rolleiflex.
   She tutored herself in the art of photography and never thought
of publishing the ``snapshots'' at the time. She notes, for
example, that many photographs inside buildings are underexposed
because of her ignorance about light. Her picture-taking diminished
after she lost the Rolleiflex on the Paris sabway in 1951.
   ``They keep fussing at me at the University Press when I say I'm
an amateur, but I am,'' she said. ``I was interested in my
subjects, not my expertise.''
   There are considerably more black people in the book than had
been shown in other collections and more than one would expect from
white photographers traveling the South. Welty says that is
something that couldn't be duplicated today, because in the 1930s
there was ``more trust'' between blacks and whites _ and the trust
``dates'' the photographs more than anything else.
   It was easy then for a moderately affluent white person to talk
with an impoverished black stranger and ask to take his picture.
Today, suspicion and overtones of exploitation would prevent such
encounters, she said.
   ``I didn't ever approach anybody and say `Stand still, I want to
take your picture.' It was all done on a human basis, with common
courtesy,'' Welty said. ``What I would usually say was `Do you mind
if I take your picture doing just what you're doing now.' ... I
didn't pose anyone. I didn't say stand here and do this. That's why
I think the pictures are so good. They are just doing what they're
doing.''

   Canadian rockers Blue Rodeo are used to stealing
shows on their own, but in their recent movie debut they played
backup band to country and western singer Meryl Streep.
   Meryl Streep?
   That's right. And, according to Blue Rodeo vocalist Greg Keelor,
the band has the Academy Award-winning actress' chauffeur to thank
for the gig.
   Platinum-selling artists in their native Canada, the five
members of Blue Rodeo hope their cameo with Streep in next year's
release of ``Postcards From the Edge'' and their new album,
``Diamond Mine,'' will propel them to similar status in the United
States.
   ``She's very good,'' group member Jim Cuddy said of Streep's
performance on ``Checking Out of the Heartbreak Hotel.''
   ``She can sing very well. She's probably kind of a boundless
entertainer.''
   Filmmaker Mike Nichols wanted a group that sounded like an early
version of The Band. Blue Rodeo, who performed with former Band
members Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson on the
Canadian Juno Awards show earlier this year, was one of five bands
asked to submit tapes.
   Streep was listening to the tapes while being driven into New
York City when her chauffeur raved about Blue Rodeo's 1987 debut,
``Outskirts,'' Keelor said. Soon after, Blue Rodeo auditioned and
won the movie role.
   ``It was a very normal kind of experience,'' said Cuddy, whose
band rehearsed Patsy Cline songs with Streep before shooting the
scene. ``I'm sure that's not the typical Hollywood experience. This
was one of the first times we've stayed in separate rooms.''
   Blue Rodeo traces its roots to the late 1970s, when Toronto
natives Keelor and Cuddy rather violently crossed paths for the
first time. Cuddy was a football linebacker who slammed quarterback
Keelor to the ground in a scrimmage. Nevertheless, they soon became
friends and began writing songs together.
   Keelor and Cuddy moved to New York City in the early '80s
looking to succeed with Fly to France, a rock band they admit now
was unfocused. Fly to France shared rehearsal space with Toronto
friends who formed the Cowboy Junkies.
   Trying to make it in New York proved unsatisfying, typified by
the disappointment the pair heard from musicians who responded to
their newspaper ad and found they wouldn't be flown to France for
auditions, Cuddy said.
   They moved back to Toronto in 1984 and ditched Fly to France.
They formed Blue Rodeo, adding acoustic guitars to their collection
and aiming for a country-rock hybrid inspired by the Everly
Brothers and the Beatles.
   ``It was the music to do,'' said the 33-year-old Cuddy. ``It
gives an artist a certain longevity, a certain respectability that
is not always evident in pop music. To just chase pop music and
chase an audience that's half your age is a little ridiculous. .. .
It's especially embarrassing if you get rejected by 11-year-olds.''
   Despite a twang in their sound, Blue Rodeo doesn't feel
comfortable in the world of country music. And, frankly, country
music probably wouldn't feel comfortable with a band whose keyboard
player occasionally solos by standing barefoot on his organ.
   ``I like the harmonies and I like the mournfulness of it,''
Cuddy said of country music. ``I've always liked the details in the
lyrics, the focus on small details, but I've never wanted to be a
full-fledged member of country music. It's just not something that
appeals to me. I think we're rock musicians borrowing from
country.''
   Like a certain famed British songwriting duo they admired, Cuddy
and Keelor's styles are often a contrast between the sinister and
the sweet.
   Cuddy's smooth voice highlights country ballads like ``Try,''
which won a Juno Award for Canadian song of the year in 1988, and
new songs ``Now and Forever'' and ``House of Dreams.''
   Keelor's vocal phrasing is a dead ringer for early Elvis
Costello on ``The Ballad of the Dime Store Greaser and the Blonde
Mona Lisa'' and, with keyboard player Bob Wiseman, he creates an
eerie, Doors-like sound on the new album's title cut.
   The contrast can be jarring on record but makes more sense
onstage when the pair harmonize, said Keelor, 35.
   ``It's certainly an advantage in that you can cover a lot of
ground in songwriting,'' Cuddy said. ``We can approach things from
a couple of different ways. And just from a physical standpoint,
it's nice not to have to sing all night.''
   Blue Rodeo's sound, for lack of a more appropriate word, has
been described as quintessentially American. They're not afraid to
sing about their southern neighbors; ``God and Country'' is about
Oliver North.
   ``There's also a sort of Canadian tradition in the band, like
Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, of writing a lot about America,''
Keelor said. ``But it's with a different perspective, it's like
with a distance.
   ``The modern world has a fascination with the United States. But
for us, it's even more tangible. We speak the language. We can
cross the borders and work down here as legal aliens. I did that
for years.''
   But Blue Rodeo's own success points out differences between the
two countries.
   In Canada, ``Outskirts'' was the country's equivalent of a
double-platinum album (more than 200,000 sold) and the band plays
in concert halls. In the United States, they're critical favorites
but are largely unknown. In the United States, a double-platinum LP
would mean that more than 2 million copies were sold.
   At a recent Blue Rodeo performance in New York, dozens of
Canadians packed the Lone Star Roadhouse. A cardboard cutout of a
Canadian Mountie hung over the stage. Such questions as ``what
province are you from?'' replaced typical New York small talk.
   ``The success we have in Canada is pretty good for us,'' Keelor
said. ``We'd like to do the same thing here. A large part of it is
just to keep playing and have people see us. We're fairly confident
that when people see us, they'll like it. It's a good show.''

   Kazuo Ishiguro set his first novel in England, but
changed his mind and moved much of its action to Nagasaki. His
second novel, a critic wrote, should be read by anyone wanting to
understand the Japanese.
   With his third novel, ``The Remains of the Day,'' the
35-year-old novelist has turned his eye on his adopted country with
an imaginative tour de force built around that most British of
institutions, the butler.
   Like Jeeves, that other famous butler of fiction, Mr. Stevens of
Darlington Hall is a proud perfectionist. But there any resemblance
ends. This is no P.J. Wodehouse farce but a somber, disturbing tale
that has harvested ecstatic reviews plus this year's Booker Prize,
Britain's most prestigious literary award.
   Ishiguro's achievement is all the greater for the fact that he
writes of a Japan he has not seen since he was 5 and of an England
that died a generation before him.
   At 35, this Nagasaki-born scion of samurai lineage is a
thoroughly modern Englishman, right down to the soft south London
accent. He writes in English, and says his Japanese is too poor for
conversation with other Japanese. But he keeps a photo of himself
as a 10-month-old baby pictured beside the family samurai swords,
and his prose has the subtlety and understatement one associates
with a Japanese watercolor.
   He can vaguely remember grown-ups mentioning genshibakudan, the
atomic bomb, but only now is he paying a visit to Japan, his first
since his oceanographer father brought the family to England in
1954 and settled in Guildford, a comfortably middle-class town
southwest of London.
   At school, Ishiguro recalls, ``I learned to use my
conspicuousness to make myself very popular. They didn't know
whether I should be hero-worshiped or stigmatized.'' He ended up
``kind of mascotized.''
   He backpacked through Europe and North America and did odd jobs,
including a season as a fieldhand on royal grouse hunts. He wanted
to be a rock musician, but ended up at novelist Malcolm Bradbury's
creative writing department at the University of East Anglia.
   He published some short stories, then a novel, ``A Pale View of
Hills.'' In 1986 came his dazzling second novel, ``An Artist of the
Floating World,'' set in 1950s Japan.
   ``We are seeing here the emergence of one of the masters of
contemporary English writing. And if you want to start to
understand the Japanese, begin here,'' wrote Paul Barker in The
Financial Times.
   The novel told of a respected painter coming to terms with his
less-than-glorious World War II years as a propaganda artist for
Japanese militarists.
   ``The Remains of the Day'' is also about old men's regrets _ in
this case the butler's recognition that Lord Darlington, the
gentleman he served with utter devotion, was a well-meaning but
wholly misguided sympathizer with Nazi Germany and a pawn in the
hands of Hitler's ambassador to Britain, Joachim von Ribbentrop.
   The story begins in 1956. Darlington Hall has passed with its
butler to an American owner, Mr. Farraday, who kindly lends Stevens
his car and sends him off on a motoring holiday through western
England.
   As he drives, Stevens reflects on his life as a butler in the
1930s, and gradually his shell of professional reserve peels away
to reveal truth after shattering truth:
   Here is a man so duteous that he kept serving drinks even though
aware that his father was dying upstairs; who was deeply loved by
the housekeeper but never realized it, and anyway, believed
marriage among servants disrupted household duties; who without
demur fired two Jewish maids because his lordship thought it was a
good idea; who was deluded enough to believe he was contributing to
world peace by serving the correct wines to the British and German
guests who would gather at Darlington Hall to plot the appeasement
of Hitler.
   Stevens' shame is not that he was pro- or anti-Nazi, but that he
never had an opinion either way, so blinded was he by duty.
   ``You see, I trusted,'' he tells a stranger when he finally
faces up to the truth. ``I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. All
those years I served him, I trusted I was doing something
worthwhile.''
   Thus Ishiguro neatly reverses the cliche of ``what the butler
saw'' by building a novel around what the butler didn't see, and
poses a crucial question for democracies everywhere: How are
ordinary citizens to make up their own minds, when ``a group of
people can shout for a long time, `we know what we're doing, just
trust us,' and most of us in this country are in a helpless
position. We just don't know enough to argue back.''
   Another achievement of ``The Remains of the Day'' is that in
telling his story entirely in Stevens's voice, Ishiguro displays a
near-flawless ear for butler language.
   Stevens is fussy, buttoned-up, comical, even exasperating. He
reflects on the English countryside's calm beauty (so different to
the ``unseemly demonstrativeness'' of American and African
landscapes); on the essence of butlering (``Not (to) be shaken out
by external events, however surprising''); or the importance of
properly polishing the silver (``the state of the silver had made a
small, but significant contribution towards the easing of relations
between Lord Halifax and Herr Ribbentrop that evening.'')
   He has trouble with his American master's little jokes and
teasings, and takes to studying a humorous radio program for tips,
``because the witticisms performed on it are always in the best of
taste and, to my mind, of a tone not at all out of keeping with the
sort of bantering Mr. Farraday might expect on my part.''
   Japanese and English societies share rigid structures that
invite comparison, but Ishiguro resists the temptation. He can see
much that is ``strange, bizarre and exotic'' in England, but
recognizes he must seem equally strange to the Japanese, who, he
suspects, are ``slightly baffled, fascinated and probably slightly
threatened'' by him because ``multiculturalism is something they're
not used to.''
   But ``culturally, people are increasingly becoming a mixture of
things,'' he says. ``I'm an obvious example of that.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Year of Milestones for Bill Monroe</HEAD>

   It's been a year of milestones for Bill
Monroe, ``the father of bluegrass music.''
   In October, the stately 78-year-old celebrated his 50th
anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry, the live country music show he
helped transform into an American institution. In February, he won
a Grammy Award in a newly added category: best bluegrass recording.
   And he ended the decade the way he began it: chatting with the
president at the White House. In 1980, he played his beloved
mandolin on the White House lawn for President Carter. This
November, he was invited to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to meet
President Bush.
   When the celebrations and awards and White House visits subside,
Monroe can sit at his office desk and read a sticker pasted on the
wall: ``Bluegrass: finger picking good.''
   This music, developed by Monroe in the 1930s, has been mighty
good indeed to this legendary performer.
   Millions have heard him on the Grand Ole Opry or in live
performances. He's entertained in every state and in several
foreign countries. He's sold more than 50 million records.
   In 1986, the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution honoring him for
``many contributions to American culture and music.''
   He says he's lasted so long because he took care of himself and
enjoyed singing and playing.
   ``I've always liked work and I've been stout,'' he said in an
interview. ``I've taken care of myself and never did smoke or
drink. Work is something I've always liked to do. I like to do
something every day.
   ``I love to play music and hear it. I love to put the sounds and
notes in there that I want to hear. I want to do the best I can for
my friends and fans sitting out there in the audience.''
   Monroe, a descendant of the fifth president of the United
States, is best known for his songs ``Blue Moon of Kentucky,''
``Uncle Pen'' and ``Mule Skinner Blues.'' ``Blue Moon of
Kentucky,'' which he wrote in 1946, was recorded some 10 years
later by Elvis Presley.
   ``I knew he was coming with another style of music,'' Monroe
recalled. ``One Saturday night, they had him on the Grand Ole Opry.
He came around to me and apologized for singing the way he did.''
   ``I told him if it gave him a good start with his music and
everything, I was for him 100 percent. So our friendship stood good
all the way.''
   Born near Rosine, Ky., Monroe was the youngest of eight children
and was orphaned by age 11. He was raised by an uncle who was an
excellent fiddler and mandolinist. By age 12, Monroe was playing
music at dances with his uncle and perfecting his tenor voice that
was to enthrall millions for years to come.
   Down through the years, he taught bluegrass music _ the string
music of guitars, banjos, fiddles and mandolins _ to disciples such
as Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, who played in his band, the
Bluegrass Boys.
   Monroe has recorded for MCA Records for nearly 40 years, a
rarity in the music industry where performers often change labels
every few years.
   ``They've been a big help to me and we work together good,'' he
said. His most recent album is ``Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys
Live at the Opry.''
   He still performs 100 times a year at bluegrass festivals,
country music shows and the like. In his office is a lined white
sheet of paper with a place on each line for the date and the city
he's booked in. Even after more than 50 years on the road, he still
finds travel inspirational.
   ``I like to see the hills and mountains and valleys and how they
take care of the land and everything,'' Monroe said.
   He's been blessed with good health and a steely determination to
keep his music alive. When he was diagnosed with colon cancer in
the early 1980s, he fought it with the spirit he shows as his
nimble fingers dance along the neck of his mandolin.
   ``The doctor said I whipped the cancer out,'' Monroe said.

   Keeping up with the changing times of frontiers falling,
European winter resorts are reaching out across borders to create
sprawling international and interconnected networks of runs where
you can cruise for days without skiing in the same tracks.
   In Switzerland, you can board a cog railway up to traffic-free
Zermatt, buckle up your skis before taking a long-distance lift and
never remove them until lunchtime spaghetti at the Italian resort
of Cervinia.
   Or you can ski through 250 miles of runs on the Franco-Italian
``Milky Way,'' starting in Europe's oldest resort, at Sestriere,
owned by the Fiat auto conglomerate. Keep on your skis through
three series of peaks and valleys and finally reach the French area
of Montgenevre, before gliding back to Italy, using more than 100
different lifts.
   At France's Chamonix, the foot of Mont Blanc, highest summit of
the Alps, you can board three cable cars over glaciers and wind
your way down to Courmayeur, on the Italian side.
   Or you can pole across the French side of the famous St.
Bernard, and schuss down to Italy to a waiting minibus which will
take you back to France through a tunnel under the mountain.
   Crossing borders _ sometimes even without a passport _ has
become a routine way of life for skiing Europeans, whose middle
class has made the winter vacation and the ``snow weekend'' a
normal occurrence.
   Parents think nothing of suiting up their children with designer
clothes, and new skis for more than $1,000 so they can enjoy a week
with their classmates at the mountain. Most city dwellers _ even
hundreds of miles away from a nearby mountain _ avidly tune in to
the snow reports and take a few days off from work as fast as the
ski rack can be fastened atop their car.
   For those who are bored with the lift lines up and the whizzing
down for the next queue, resorts are dreaming up a few new wrinkles
imported from the United States. Freestyle skiing, monoski and
snowboard are big in France, with special instruction classes.
Daring mountaineers offer deltaplaning in every Alpine resort,
while even sleddogging is taught by a veteran of the famous Alaska
race in Italy's Pontedilegno-Tonale.
   Costume parties _ even outside the Carnival period _ or torchlit
descents in the starlit nights with instructors take place weekly
throughout Austria, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany.
   Finally, cross-country skiing has caught on not just for the
over-60s, but for young children, encouraged by low equipment
rental fees.
   Most Europeans however, dream of the great runs of the big-name
resorts:
   Cortina d'Ampezzo, site of the 1956 Winter Olympics, snuggles
deep in the Italian Dolomites, offering an array of 11 valleys and
660 miles of tracks, with a large part kept skiable by artifical
snow machines.
   Val d'Isere in France, with Tignes and Super Tignes, now
bristles with high-rises and hi-tech lifts allowing glacier skiing
late into the spring.
   Nearby Albertville will host the 1992 Winter Olympics, which
former world champion Jean Claude Killy has been promoting around
the world.
   Switzerland, celebrating its 700th anniversary as a
confederation in 1991, appeals to the posh set with St.Moritz,
Crans-Montana and Verbier, only a couple of hours from Geneva
airport.
   And Austrians beckon from the start of November thanks to snow
machines in their Tyrol resorts of St. Anton and Kitsbuhel, which
hosts World Cup downhill and slalom races for both men and women
next January.
   But skiers should look east and south for the best bargains and
the most challenging runs.
   Runaway currency devaluation and a strong tourist industry has
made Yugoslavia, for example, one of the most economical
destinations.
   Last year, while many European resorts wept over lack of snow
due to a freak warm winter, spanking new Kopaonik, in central
Yugoslavia, frolicked in snow banks and 26 miles of broad pistes.
Further north, in Slovenia, just over the Italian border, Kranjska
Gora, site of many World Cup races, also began attracting
cost-conscious mountaineers. One of the greatest draws is the power
of hard currency which can buy top-of-the line skis for less than
$150 and beautifully hand-knit sweaters for less than $50. Let
alone hotel rooms for less than $40 a night.
   The other new bargain areas are found mainly above the plains in
Spain. Baqueira Beret, in Catalonia in the Spanish Pyrenees, is a
favorite of sportsman King Juan Carlos and his family and for
skiers who like to pile in the paella rice, Sangria wine and late
night flamenco high in the Pyrenees.
   Nestled in the snowy peaks between France and Spain, the tiny
republic of Andorra offers half a dozen sites where the snow is
still virgin and where the valleys echo with Catalonian songs of
its hardy shepherds. Andorra's duty-free status also allows for
some of the best ski equipment and clothes bargains in Europe.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade ago, Tokyo completed a first-rate
international airport which it confidently believed would serve as
the gateway for a great influx of visitors.
   The tourist boom it expected has not taken place, largely
because the airport is a long way out of town, and many prospective
visitors are turned away by chilling tales of the high cost of
everything. Enroute to other Asian cities, they opt to stay over in
one of the airport hotels and resume their journeys the next day.
   If they are out for adventure and excitement, they have made the
wrong decision, for Tokyo is one of the liveliest, most vibrant and
culturally rich cities on earth. ``Ca vaut le detour,'' as the
French say. ``It is worth going out of one's way to see.''
   The city is immense. Twelve million people. But to the visitor
strolling around its 23 wards it seems more like a string of
self-contained villages, each with its own markets, department
stores, cinemas, theaters, bathhouses and places of entertainment.
It is a city in a hurry, yet its business gets done each day
smoothly, efficiently, politely. The streets are clean, and it is
one of the safest cities anywhere.
   The city may be expensive _ actually it is not much more so than
London _ but the human spectacle and much else is free. Trains,
buses, subways and taxis get you to your destination quickly and
with little fuss. And, mercifully, English signs pointing the way
proliferate.
   What astonishes the first-time visitor is the discovery that
Tokyo, while giving ample evidence of its oriental roots, also is a
great center of Western culture.
   Kabuki and Noh, the classical theater, dazzle the newcomer along
with bunraku, the centuries-old art of the puppet. Thanks to
Tokyo's prosperity, they flourish as never before. But their appeal
to Japanese is miniscule compared to the powerful attraction of
Western music _ both popular and classical _ dance and opera. No
city has so many symphony orchestras, ballet companies or fulltime
opera troupes. There are five or six of each playing to full houses
most of the time.
   Yet this hardly slakes the cultural thirst. To accomodate it,
Japanese impresarios spend millions each year to bring the best
they can offer to Tokyo. And the prices are indeed daunting. The
equivalent of three hundred dollars for a ticket is not unusual.
Despite this, most performances are sold out months in advance.
   Devotees of jazz, rock, punk, heavy metal, country and western
and just plain pop music pay less to hear their heroes and heroines
because there are more of them. The home-grown product, with the
exception of popular singing, is inferior, but the ravenous Tokyo
appetite for the loudest, funkiest and best the West can offer is
regularly satisfied by famous bands and singers.
   Art lovers can walk their feet off in Tokyo's more than fifty
galleries and museums, many of which contain masterpieces of Asian,
American and European painting and sculpture. There is something
for nearly every taste, from Rembrandt to Andy Warhol.
   If there were any doubts about Tokyo's standing in the world of
culture, they were dispelled when the great French museum, the
Louvre, twice consented to part temporarily with two of its
treasures, Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic Mona Lisa, and the
celebrated Greek sculpture, the Venus de Milo. Displayed in the
National Museum, they were seen by admiring millions. And when the
widely admired American painter, Andrew Wyeth, decided to hold his
first exhibition abroad, it took place in Tokyo.
   Some of the galleries occupy space in big department stores. The
first posthumous exhibition of the erotic art of the Spanish
master, Pablo Picasso, took place in a department store, reached
through the kimono and lingerie displays.
   Because they get no tax breaks, big corporations do not
contribute to art and culture on the American scale. But several of
them own and run galleries of their own. One of these is the
Idemitsu Oil company, which has one of the best collections of
Chinese porcelain in existence. Another, the Bridgestone Tire
Company, boasts a handful of Rembrandts as well as other Western
masters.
   The Museum of Western Art, in the Ueno cultural complex, houses
the important Matsukata collection of French impressionist art. It
also contains the second best collection of Rodin sculptures
anywhere. A half dozen of the most celebrated of the Matsukata
paintings remain in Paris, confiscated by the French government at
the beginning of World War II as enemy property and not since
returned.
   Prestige was the reason a big Tokyo insurance company forked out
forty million dollars to buy van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' recently. It
reasoned that it not only was a masterpiece but a gilt-edged
investment. It hangs in a special room of the company's
headquarters where thousands of Japanese have admired it.
   Prestige also was the motive of the owner of the New Otani hotel
in Tokyo in persuading the celebrated French restaurant, the Tour
d'Argent, to open its only branch overseas on its first floor.
Perhaps the most expensive restaurant in the world, the Tour
d'Argent is one of several hundred French restaurants which, along
with those of other countries, make eating out in Tokyo high
adventure. They are managed either by French chefs or Japanese
trained in France.
   So next time you go through Tokyo, throw caution and checkbook
to the winds. What could be more exciting than an afternoon visit
to a museum, a concert or ballet in the evening, the kabuki next
day, then superb French, Chinese or Japanese cuisine to top it off?
After all, you only live once.

   Wyoming is inviting one and all to take a
step into its rollicking, rowdy past during the state's year-long
centennial celebration in 1990.
   Settled by rugged mountain men who revered the Rocky Mountains'
beaver pelts as highly as gold and later by cowboys tending cattle
herds that once made Cheyenne the richest town per capita in the
world, Wyoming's heritage is woven of the stuff that made the West
wild.
   Justice once was dispensed with a short rope and a long drop,
and outlaws like Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and the rest of
``the Wild Bunch'' often high-tailed it to the ``Hole in the Wall''
west of Kaycee in central Wyoming to avoid the gallows between bank
heists and train holdups.
   The outlaws, the range wars between cattlemen and sheep
ranchers, and the lonely lives of cowboys riding the desolate
plains in search of strays all combined to give Wyoming an image as
a wild place for the rough-and-ready.
   During 1990 travelers will be able to sample this life, be it by
viewing the state's open expanses from atop a Conestoga wagon, by
taking in the world's largest rodeo at the 94th annual Cheyenne
Frontier Days in late July, or by walking through the barracks at
Fort Laramie, where the cavalry once protected emigrants passing
along the Overland Trail.
   ``There will be plenty of western-oriented activities for people
to participate in,'' says Becky Evans, community service consultant
for the Wyoming Centennial Commission.
   And the activities will be found in just about every corner of
the state as communities from Cody to Cheyenne, Spotted Horse to
Smoot, and Mule Creek Junction to Moose celebrate the centennial.
   While the state that boasts of being ``What America Once Was''
won't actually turn 100 until July 10, the partying begins on Jan.
1 and runs through the end of the year.
   Montana's centennial party this year gained nationwide attention
with a massive, and dusty, cattle drive reminiscent of those run
from Texas to Wyoming and Montana in the late 1800s, but in Wyoming
there's really no single eye-grabbing, headline-catching event.
   Instead the Wyoming Centennial Commission is urging the state's
communities to mark the birthday in ways fitting to their
particular heritage.
   With that in mind, for those tourists who want to step into the
past there will be wagon trains and trail rides, shootouts and
rodeos, ice cream socials and elaborate balls.
   Those who prefer to mix the present with the past will be able
to take in an international centennial celebration in Worland
featuring Chinese ice sculptures, cheer on cyclists in the Casper
Classic International Bike Race in Casper, or take in the Grand
Teton Music Festival with 13,766-foot-tall Grand Teton serving as a
backdrop.
   A look at the mountain men who wandered the state's rocky ranges
in search of furs will be possible in Pinedale in early July, when
the 54th reenactment of the 1840 mountain man rendezvous on the
Green River is staged.
   The biggest individual birthday party will be held in early July
in Cheyenne, the state capital tucked away in Wyoming's
southeastern corner. The celebration July 7-10 will include a
reenactment of the arrival of the original telegram declaring
Wyoming's statehood, an ethnic festival recognizing the diverse
cultures that call the state home, and a fireworks extravaganza.
   Evans said 10,000-15,000 people a day are expected to join the
revelry in Cheyenne, which in the late 1800s was known as ``Hell on
Wheels'' because of the hard-drinking, gun-toting men who passed
through the frontier town.
   Wyoming's geography is just as diverse as the centennial
celebrations. Although the eastern half of the state is mostly
high, desolate plains cut here and there by long, narrow strips of
mountain ranges, the western half is internationally renowned for
its grandeur.
   Secretary of State James Baker brought Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze to Jackson Hole in September to conduct
ministerial meetings in the shadows of the craggy, snow-capped
Tetons. Just to the north of the valley is the world's first
national park, Yellowstone, and its vast bison and elk herds and
thousands of thermal features.
   ``There's plenty for people to participate in 1990,'' Evans
says. ``All they have to is contact us and we'll let them know.''

   Visitors who visit Idaho during its 1990
Centennial have a unique opportunity to experience the theme that
runs through the state's history like a vein of gold _ man's love
affair with the land.
   The Gem State's 100th birthday party will feature a gamut of
``Wild West'' celebrations in virtually every town and county. And
there is the added reward of traveling through eye-catching Idaho.
   Idaho became the 43rd state on July 3, 1890.
   Settlers traveled to Idaho for its resources: gold and silver,
endless stands of timber, the rich volcanic soil.
   ``People who came here were looking for something to exploit,
but not in the bad sense,'' said Arthur Hart, a member of the Idaho
Centennial Commission who spent 17 years as director of the Idaho
Historical Society.
   One of the most involved projects in the celebration is the
creation of a Centennial Park. State officials insisted that
monument reflect industry's role in opening up the wild territory
to civilization.
   Mining attracted the first major influx of settlers, so it was
natural to locate the park around the old gold rush towns of Custer
and Bonanza in central Idaho.
   Those rustic ghost towns are a short jaunt off Idaho 75, nestled
in the pines along the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River. Ore wagons
rattled along the Motorway toll road to the ranching community of
Challis, where the park's interpretive center will be built.
   ``We had two Oregon Trail parks, but we didn't have any park for
mining, which brought them here in the first place,'' Hart said.
``The Oregon Trail people passed through Idaho, but didn't think
they could farm here.''
   Within two hour's drive from the Centennial Park are the granite
crags of the Sawtooth Mountains, the champagne whitewater of the
Middle and Main forks of the Salmon, or the world-class ski slopes
of Sun Valley. The resort retains the 1940s aura that attracted the
world's elite: Ernest Hemingway, Gary Cooper and Clark Gable, to
name a few.
   The Silver Valley in the Idaho Panhandle historically has ranked
as one of the top 10 mining districts in the world.
   Travelers intending to put in a busy day can visit the Coeur
d'Alene District Mining Museum in Wallace, Idaho's oldest standing
building in the Catholic Cataldo Mission built in 1853, or the
lakeside resort community of Coeur d'Alene.
   Cataldo was built by Jesuit priests and local Indians using
wooden pegs instead of nails.
   North America's longest gondola will soon stretch from the town
of Kellogg to the Silverhorn ski area in the Silver Valley.
   Northern Idaho remains a thick carpet of timber and once
featured the largest stand of white pine in the world. Lumberjacks
used to transport logs on the Clearwater River to the sawmills of
Lewiston in gigantic wooden flotillas complete with tents for
cooking and sleeping.
   Lumberjacks will chop, saw and climb trees as Lewiston showcases
its logging heritage with the grand finals of the World Association
of Timber Sports in May, 1990.
   People from all races came to Idaho to work the mines, farm or
build the railroads. The centennial honors them all with
celebrations or interpretive studies.
   In the midst of World War II in 1942, 9,400 Japanese-Americans
were relocated to the wind-swept Minidoka Relocation Center near
Twin Falls in south-central Idaho.
   The Japanese American Citizens League plans to build an
interpretive center at the camp.
   Basques from the Spanish Pyrenees migrated to the United States
from the 1800s on to tend sheep bands. Boise is the largest enclave
of Basques in North America. They plan their second Jaialdi
cultural festival in Boise in June, 1990, drawing Basques from the
West and Europe.
   When American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark
passed into Idaho through Lolo Pass in 1805, they met friendly
Shoshone and Nez Perce Indian tribes who had roamed through
northern Idaho on spotted appaloosa horses for centuries.
   They are two of the state's six tribes that will meet for the
first time in Boise on July 9-15 for an ``All Idaho Indian Expo''
to present their histories, dreams and social issues.
   The Idaho Centennial calendar lists more than 500 events next
year, from an Idaho Cowboy Poetry Gathering to a whistle stop tour
of Union Pacific Railroad's steam engine No. 8444. Idaho's
Statehood Day celebration will run 43 hours from July 2 to
Independence Day with a dizzying schedule of fireworks and parades.
   ``Former Gov. John Evans said `I want a celebration of one
million,'' meaning he wanted every man, woman and child involved,''
Hart said. ``We're coming as close to that as we can.''

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's Hawaii's newest beach and one of
its largest, but it attracts no swimmers and few sunbathers.
   Except for naturalists or small groups of tourists who come for
a quick look and snapshots, it's usually deserted.
   ``Kamoamoa is now the largest of the black sand beaches,'' said
Reggie Okamura, assistant scientist in charge of the U.S.
Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.
   The new beach was formed after lava from the eruption of Kilauea
Volcano began flowing into the ocean three years ago.
   More than a half-mile long and about 25 yards wide, it is bigger
than Kaimu, the famed Kalapana black sand beach nearby, Okamura
said.
   ``Kamoamoa was formed the same way all other black sand beaches
are formed,'' he said.
   `'When the molten lava pours into the ocean, the cooling effect
of the water shatters the rock,'' he said.
   Ocean currents then push the minute particles to shore, he
explained.
   The 23-mile coastline of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is now
pocked with small black-sand beaches, he said.
   A 25-foot cliff previously formed the shoreline boundary of the
Kamoamoa Campground, located six miles west of Kalapana, a village
on Hawaii Islands's southeast coast.
   Now, the wide beach with its steep slope to the water adjoins
the campground.
   ``The sand was pushed up against the cliff.'' Okamura said.
``The cliff is now buried under the sand.
   ``I think the beach enhanced the campground,'' he said. ``It's a
beautiful place to camp.''
   ``The campground is the nicest on the island, but is not heavily
used,'' said Jon Erickson, chief naturalist at the national park.
   ``Before the lava flow, it was little used; we get a few more
campers now, mostly island people who come to see the lava,'' he
said.
   From the grassy, palm tree-lined campground and the adjoining
beach, visitors can see the huge smoke and steam plumes which waft
out to sea from the points where the 2,200-degree lava pours into
the 60-70-degree water.
   However, the beach is not very inviting to sunbathers. The sand
formed by the lava particles is coarse, with sharp edges on the
larger particles.
   ``It takes a lot of wave action to round out the particles,''
Okamura said. ``Right now, it's not very comfortable to walk on the
sand barefoot.''
   ``We tell people going to see the flow to stop in at the
beach,'' Erickson said. ``On a normal day, several thousand people
visit the flow area but only 20-25 percent visit the beach.''
   Signs posted by the National Park Service prohibit swimming
because of high surf and dangerous currents.
   Beaches began forming almost immediately after lava began
flowing into the ocean in November, 1986, according to Erickson.
Kamoamoa began appearing in mid-January 1988.
   Most of the sand is from the original entry point into the ocean
about two miles east Kamoamoa, Okamura said.
   Lava recently was entering the ocean at four points, the closest
just one mile from the big beach, he said.
   Kamoamoa is 1{ miles west of the Wahaula Visitors Center, which
was destroyed by lava on June 22, 1989.
   The new beach could disappear if and when the volcano, the
source of the sand, ends its nearly seven-year-old eruption,
Okamura said.
   ``Once the eruption stops, who knows how long the sand will
last,'' he said. ``The beach is steep. Erosion or wave action
probably will take it away,'' he said.
   However, no one knows when the eruption will end.
   ``Right now, the activity is as vigorous as ever,'' said
Erickson.
   Kilauea Volcano's east rift zone eruption began on Jan. 3, 1983.
Lava from the Pu`u O`o and Kupaianaha vents has flowed into
residential areas on numerous occasions, destroying 74 homes.

   The first tune the children of
Spruga seem to learn is that of the klaxons of the yellow Postbuses
that wind their way through the mountains above Locarno, at the
northern end of Lake Maggiore in Switzerland's Ticino.
   A child on his tricycle pedals fast toward a stranger and stops
just short of a collision. He sings out like a klaxon and pedals
off. Another child, restless on her mother's lap, echoes the klaxon
warning of the bus as it rounds a series of tight curves.
   Spruga, Indemini and their fellow communities wrapped high into
the Alps above Locarno and Lugano or tucked into the river valleys
are groupings of gray stone houses with heavy-looking, gray slate
roofs. The gray, cobbled streets are often stairs. All look as if
they had been, and would be, there forever. Geraniums and other
flowers add a blast of color. Woods and pastures are all around and
much of the year, a sound heard even more frequently than that of
the klaxon is that of cowbells.
   At the foot of the mountains lie Lake Maggiore and Locarno, with
palm and fig trees, oleanders and flowers and accessible lakefront.
There are restaurants galore, an Old Town and a Lido. On market
day, booths along its main street sell everything from kitchen
utensils to raincoats to jewelry made in India. The long arcade
along the street is a sort of permanent market: sneakers and
scarves, toys and teddy bears, and food of all kinds, including
almonds that a smiling old lady dips in hot caramel.
   The arcade is a splendid shelter on a rainy day (Locarno, famous
for its sunshine, does have rain, too). Another indoor spot
demanding a visit is the museum in the Castello Visconteo, a
centuries-old restored castle whose exhibits range from Jean Arp's
paintings to Roman glass, bronzes and other artifacts from the
first century.
   As one dines at the Trattoria da Luigi, takes the funicular to
the shrine of the Madonna del Sasso, or the lake boats to Muralto,
Luino and the like, one sinks into the feeling of being in Italy.
The names, the flowers, the sun, the blue water, the stuccoed
buildings in pink and cream suggest the Mediterranean. But it is
Switzerland, though the Swiss didn't get hold of it for keeps until
the 16th century. Locarno was a commercial crossroads and military
base under the Romans, who called the predominantly Celtic people
they found there the Helvetii. Julius Caesar defeated them in the
Gallic Wars and then made allies of them.
   Locarno also was the scene in 1925 of an international
conference including France, Britain, Germany and a number of other
nations that drew up a series of mutual guarantees known as the
Locarno Pact, supposed to create a spirit of peace and goodwill.
Britain's foreign secretary at the time, Austen Chamberlain, was a
key figure at the meeting. Adolf Hitler denounced the pact in 1936
and remilitarized the Rhineland. (Chamberlain's half-brother,
Neville, later British prime minister, signed another, more
notorious peace pact with Hitler in 1938 at Munich with similar
results, with Czechoslovakia as the pawn.)
   But the average visitor to Locarno, Lake Maggiore and its sister
lake, Lugano, will probably save historical research for another
time, concentrating instead on the lake boats and the mountains.
Heading south from Locarno, he soon will truly be in Italy. On the
way, he can stop at Switzerland's Brissago Isles, where a botanical
garden has plants from subtropical regions all over the world _
Australia, China, North Africa, the Americas, the Mediterranean.
This is just a foretaste of what's waiting at the south end of the
lake, on Italy's Borromeo Islands, owned since the early 16th
century by the Borromeo family _ prominent, rich and devout.
(Charles Borromeo, who died in 1584, was canonized.)
   The garden at Isola Madre with its bitter orange, mimosa,
Egyptian papyrus and banana trees has five terraces and a palace _
relatively modest by 18th century palatial standards. White and
blue-green peacocks stroll the lawns and pheasants are almost under
foot.
   On Isola Bella, the gardens are more elaborate: ten terraces,
surmounted by a multistoried sculpture with niches containing
figures and sculpted scallop shells. Statues are silhouetted
against the sky. Atop the whole thing is the sculpted family
symbol, a unicorn. It's baroque, beautiful _ and blatant. The
enormous palace (one guidebook quotes French author Gustave
Flaubert as saying it could have accommodated 2,000 people) is on a
par with the gardens. There are a weapons and armor room, a
tapestry gallery, a room where Napoleon and his family stayed as
guests, and three theaters, including a Hell Theater, with
marionettes symbolizing the environment and a two-pipe organ to
produce lugubrious sounds.
   Lying between Isola Bella and Isola Madre is Isola dei
Pescatori, a longtime fishing village which has narrow streets and
stone houses, but also a heavy overlay of tourists and vendors.

   Hong Kong, virtually on the eve of losing its status as a
British crown colony, will become a part of China again in 1997.
The Chinese have promised not to tamper with their new possession
for 50 years after that, but confidence in that promise has been
severely shaken by the bloody suppression of the democratic
movement on the mainland last spring.
   In the meantime, Hong Kong remains a tourist's delight. The
colony consists of Hong Kong Island, a host of smaller, satellite
islands, Kowloon Peninsula on the mainland, and the New
Territories, which extend all the way up to the border with China.
   One of the more pleasant surprises awaiting a first-time visitor
to Hong Kong is the ease with which one can get from place to
place. The subways are swift, virtually noiseless, clean, and free
of graffiti. Instructions (in both English and Chinese) are
conspicuous and easy to read. Uniformed agents stand outside
turnstiles to answer questions.
   Buses and trolleys _ big, lumbering, multicolor double-deckers _
also can take you anywhere. The top deck offers the better view of
the passing scene. And don't overlook the Star Ferry _ a small
fleet that runs between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. First class
is only 9 cents.
   But the best way to get from here to there is by cab. Taxis are
clean, comfortable and air-conditioned. The drivers are polite,
friendly and informative. Best of all, cabs are cheap, a third what
you pay in the larger stateside cities. Tipping is not expected but
it is customary to leave some portion of your change.
   Equally pleasant will be the shopping bargains you'll encounter,
such as jade in msny colors, ivory both old and new, batik and
beautifully delicate cloissone.
   Cameras or electronics are not a good buy in the Far East; never
mind that they are made there. You can do better back in the U.S.
   There is a multiplicity of places to shop. Check out Ocean
Terminal, the Chinese Arts and Crafts Center, the Yue Hwa
Department Store and Stanley Market on the far side of Hong Kong
Island.
   Look for the decal in the shop window that identifies the
merchant as a member of the Hong Kong Merchants Association, a
pledge of value for money. And don't overlook the night markets _
garishly lit outdoor areas that open when the commercial
establishments close. You can shop, eat and shop some more.
   When you tear yourself from your shopping spree, you will want
to eat. You'll find chicken, duck, pork and denizens of the deep in
varieties you may never have heard of. Service, decor and
preparation of dishes are impeccable.
   Your hotel will help you find good restaurants and will make
reservations for you. Some good examples: the Man Wah Restaurant in
the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the Korean Barbecue House, the Royal
Thai and, near the Chinese border in the New Territories, the Yucca
de Lac.
   Like most major cities, Hong Kong is full of things to see and
do, but if you are pressed for time there is one absolute must:
Victoria Peak. The peak is the highest point on Hong Kong Island
and is the vantage point for one of the most dazzling views in the
world. It is reachable by bus or taxi, but the most enjoyable way
to get there is ``the tram to the peak.''
   The view is spectacular at night, when the jeweled city and
harbor are spread out at your feet. But it is equally spellbinding
in the daytime, when a clear blue sky forms a canopy over the
noonday splendor of the city.

   If you're looking for a ride on the
wild side, look North.
   Not only do the Adirondack Mountains offer the largest
wilderness area in the United States _ Adirondack Park encompasses
some 6 million acres _ they are home to three of the wildest rides
imaginable.
   There is only one place in the United States where you can pay a
fee and take a ride down an Olympic bobsled run: Lake Placid.
   Officials at the Olympic complex here call the bobrun the
``Champagne of Thrills,'' and it's easy to see why. The only
drawback is that the ride is short-lived _ it only takes a minute
or so to make the half-mile run.
   But even though Olympians travel at speeds approaching 90 mph,
at 55 it's sometimes hard to imagine you'll arrive alive.
Especially on the final turn, where it seems as though the sled
will slam right into the solid wall of ice bordering the left side
of track.
   The rides at the Olympic Bobrun, which have been offered at
Mount Van Hoevenberg since the 1930s, this year have taken on a new
dimension with the addition of six new sleds capable of carrying
three or four passengers along with the driver and brakeman. They
replace the old sleds, which were built in the 1940s.
   ``We needed to replace our existing sleds because eventually
things wear out,'' says Jim Lamy, who designed the new sleds and
also manages the Bobrun. The rides cost $15 and are offered Tuesday
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon and from 1-3 p.m. And even
though they don't begin where the Olympians do, they don't leave
out the two most famous turns in the sport _ everybody Zigs and
everybody Zags.
   Just a few feet away from the bobrun sits one of the most
amazing sights in all of sports _ the luge run. Watching lugers
navigate the twisting turns of the ice-covered course at speeds
approaching 80 miles per hour on television doesn't do this sport
justice. It must be seen in person to be believed, and even then it
seems unbelievable.
   But there's a cure for disbelievers. Yep, you can take a ride on
one of those tiny little things the Europeans have the audacity to
call a sled. The only catch is nobody will share your fear once you
start sliding _ you're on your own after a minute-long ``crash
course'' on luging. Pay strict attention to your coach if you want,
but you'll probably forget what he said on the first turn.
   The first 10 feet aren't bad, but when you get to a
horseshoe-shaped turn called Omega, you'll no doubt wonder why they
didn't name the course that instead. Traveling feet-first at 35
miles an hour and unable to see exactly where you're going is
somewhat unsettling, but chances are you'll be alternately saying
to yourself _ ``I wish this ride was over! I hope this lasts
forever! Am I out of my mind, or what!''
   Nevertheless, one ride is all it takes to see how easy it is to
get hooked on the sport. For $10 you can get hooked on Saturdays
and Sundays, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Both luge rides are subject to
weather and track conditions, so call first (518-523-4436).
   Not far to the west of the Olympic complex sits Mount Marcy, the
state's highest peak, and Lake Tear of the Clouds _ the source of
the Hudson River and the source of perhaps the most thrilling of
the three rides.
   The Hudson Gorge, virtually inaccessible even today, is located
about 20 miles to the southwest. In the first half of this century,
logging was big business in the North Country. The timber companies
pulled out in the 1950s, and since the late 1970s, rafts have
replaced the logs.
   Each April and May thousands of thrill-seekers show up to raft
the Hudson, which each year becomes a raging torrent by melting
snow and releases from the Abanakee Dam in the village of Indian
Lake.
   Adventurers can choose from 11 outfitters. Overnight trips are
offered, but the four-hour, 16-mile ones are the most popular. All
are made in 160-pound rubber and fabric rafts that, at first
glance, look too flimsy to withstand collisions with rocks and
jolts of the rapids.
   Instructions for this ride are short and sweet, but vastly more
important because your life may be at stake if you make a mistake.
   You'll hear the following before you get on the river: ``If you
fall in _ and someone usually does _ roll on your back and get your
feet pointed downstream. If you get separated from the boat, work
your way to shore, and we'll come and get you.''
   With the water temperature usually at around 40 degrees in early
spring, you'll pray they won't have to come for you.

   Frontier Visatours aims at the 55-plus winter traveler, known
affectionately as ``Sunshine Birds,'' counterparts of the ``Snow
Birds'' who go to Florida for the season.
   One of its trips is called the Snow Train, a four-hour Amtrak
journey through the Sierra Nevada Mountains at elevations 9,000
feet and higher. _
   The Budweiser Eagle Liner, the ski train between Denver and
Winter Park, Colo., begins its 1989-1990 season on Dec. 2. The
train makes a two-hour trip through the Rockies every Saturday in
December and Saturdays and Sundays from Jan. 6 through April 8,
with two holiday excursions Dec. 26 and 29.
   (The Hyatt Regency Denver downtown offers a discount on the ski
train fare for its guests.) _
   New air service to Colorado ski country begins Dec. 23, when
America West Airlines starts its operation of daily flights from
Phoenix to Vail and Beaver Creek and weekly service from Los
Angeles. _
   The new vertical rise gondola, The Silver Queen, will whisk
Aspen Mountain skiers from base to summit in less than 15 minutes,
a trip that used to take about 45 minutes. The vertical rise is the
world's longest and is at the heart of Colorado ski country,
incorporating Snowmass, Buttermilk, Aspen Mountain and Aspen
Highlands. The four-mountain area has more than 3,700 acres of
skiable terrain with 4l lifts, including four quad SuperChairs. _
   Improved amenities for East Coast skiers include new snowmaking
on the recently opened Timberline Peak at the Bolton Valley Resort
in Vermont. Night lighting, previously limited to the lower
mountain, now extends to the summit. Nine and one-half acres of ski
terrain on the connecting trail between Ricker Mountain and
Timberline Peak assures access to the Timberline quadruple
chairlift from Village lifts 3 and 4. _
   A new ski-in, ski-out resort at Beaver Creek, Colo., was opened
this fall by Hyatt Regency. The resort is adjacent to two lifts for
some of Colorado's best ski runs, including the crest of the 2
3@4-mile run laid out in a bid for the Winter Olympics in l976. The
Alpine-style resort has 300 rooms and is in a auto-free village
which also is home to the Vail@Beaver Creek ski school. _

   Tour operators, recognizing the growing popularity of
snowmobiling, are introducing winter vacationers to the adventure
of going where only a snowmobile can go, from Yellowstone National
Park to the north woods of Wisconsin, from interior Alaska to
Canada.
   There are more than 100,000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails
in North America, according to Bombardier Inc., Quebec, Canada,
manufacturers of Ski-Doo snowmobiles.
   The company says snowmobilers in the United States and Canada
spend more than $3.2 billion on the sport each year, including
equipment, clothing, accessories and vacations, with nearly 130,000
snowmobiles sold in the two nations last year.
   One snowmobile vacation package is offered by Decker's
Sno-Venture, Eagle River, Wis., which includes an Alaskan Adventure
among its U.S. destinations this year. There also are Western tours
to Wyoming, Utah and Montana, and Midwestern tours to northern
Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
   Sno-Venture Tours is owned and operated by Dick and Audrey
Decker, former snowmobile racers.
   Yellowstone Adventures, West Yellowstone, Mont., owned and
operated by Jerry Schmier and his family, expects to take 4,000 or
more people on tours this winter.
   ``We find that lots of people are intrigued by the idea of
seeing one of the world's most scenic regions covered with snow,''
says Schmier, ``and they can see more of it on a snowmobile than
any other means of transportation.''
   Tour packages in Quebec are offered by Quebec Snow Cruises Inc.

   What you might call ``low-impact tourism,'' ecologically
sensitive travel or adventure cruising, is inspiring the travel
industry to offer tour packages reflecting interest in the
environment.
   As one travel firm, Sobek Expeditions of Angels Camp, Calif.,
put it in announcing environmental adventures for 1990 in such
places as Brazil, Costa Rica, India-Nepal, Tanzania and Indonesia:
   ``(We) hope to translate enthusiasm for wild places into energy
directed toward their preservation.''
   Another organization, Overseas Adventure Travel of Cambridge,
Mass., offers birding in remote rain forests of Costa Rica, gorilla
trekking in Rwanda, hiking in Mount Everest National Park, safaris
in Serengeti and treks in Machu Picchu National Park in Peru.
   ``On an adventure cruise, passengers take an active role in
every aspect of the expedition,'' says Douglas Ward, executive
director of the International Cruise Passengers Association.
   ``Naturalists and lecturers are aboard each ship to provide
background information and regional observations about wildlife.''
   Because of the briefings, lectures and a laboratory at sea,
there is a cultural and intellectual element not found on other
cruise ships, explains Ward, author of the Berlitz ``Complete
Handbook to Cruising.''
   The adventure cruise vessel, he adds, provides elegant and
comfortable surroundings for up to 200 passengers, a highly trained
and knowledgeable staff and first-class food.
   ``Without traditional cruise ports to stop at, the ship must be
self-sufficient and capable of long-range cruising,'' Ward says.
   Many of the cruises use small inflatable rubber boats known as
Zodiacs to get closer to their wildlife destinations because the
mother ships are too large to navigate some shallow rivers and
tributaries.
   Developed by famed explorer Jacques Cousteau, the boats hold up
to 15 people and can penetrate deep into otherwise inaccessible
areas.
   As Ward explains, ``the adventure cruise ship is seldom
`alongside' a dock and is more likely to be found at anchor in a
small inlet or bay. For use as a diving base in warm waters, such
as around Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the Zodiac is ideal and
is safe and unsinkable.''
   Many conservation-oriented travel organizations play an active
role in supporting environmental preservation programs.
   The Overseas Adventure group, for example, donates $40 per
person participating in their Kenya safaris to the Rhina Ark Fund,
which helps finance the building of a fence to prevent poaching of
rhinos.
   On Himalayan treks it uses no wood for cooking, which helps
prevent further deforestation, and all trash is carried out of the
mountains. In addition, a percentage of each trekker's fees goes to
help maintain the trails and conservation programs.
   And Chicago-based Classic Tours International, which offers
packages including cruises down Egypt's Nile River, donates a
portion of each tour program to organizations dedicated to the
preservation of historic sites and the conservation of wildlife.

   Grand pianos and haute cuisine.
Mahogany and gold. A Florida company is bringing European-style
luxury trains to the American rails _ for a price.
   Refurbished Pullman cars started carrying passengers coddled by
an on-board staff between Chicago and Washington, D.C., Nov. 15,
using Amtrak rails and stations.
   American-European Express Railway Co. patterned the luxury
service after the storied Orient Express. Edy Zuger, chief
executive officer of Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express of Zurich,
Switzerland, which operates luxury trains in Europe and Asia, is a
partner in the $15 million venture.
   Ten refurbished Pullman cars dating to the 1930s have leather
and mahagony interiors trimmed with brass and 24 karat gold. Two
club cars have grand pianos. Dining cars will serve seven-course
meals on fine china.
   Passengers will have access to a fax machine and telephone along
the Chicago-Washington route that was picked in part for its
scenery, said Bill Spann, president of the Florida company. No
single seats will be available _ only cabins.
   ``Businessmen holding meetings, newlyweds, people having
affairs'' are some of the intended passengers, Spann said.
   The luxury cars will be hitched to regular Amtrak trains.
One-way fares for the cabins along the Chicago-Washington route
will range from $695 for a single to $1,450 for the biggest cabin,
called the ``Presidential.''
   Amtrak charges between $103 and $356 one way for trips between
Chicago and Washington. Travelers on the Panama City-Atlanta
preview will pay $425 a person.
   It cost the company $1 million each to refurbish the Pullman
cars. All but one are completed.

   Along with your shrink, your barkeep and perhaps your mother,
the people you turn to for solace include travel agents.
   A survey commissioned by Travel Agent magazine indicates that 88
percent of travelers interviewed prefer the reassurance and
approval of a real person _ the travel agent _ when planning
vacations.
   ``The customer is seeking verification from a respected source
that travel plans are sound and that the trip is going to go
well,'' says David Zucker, the magazine's publisher.
   The survey, conducted by Oxtoby-Smith, a consumer research firm,
also found that only half of the travel agent's clients have a firm
idea of where they want to go when they seek the agent's services,
and of those, two-thirds were willing to change their minds if the
agent suggests a good alternative destination. _
   About one in 10 travelers to foreign countries have at one time
or other canceled or changed their travel plans because of fears of
terrorism like airplane bombings and hijackings of cruise ships and
planes, according to a Louis Harris survey commissioned by Travel
and Leisure magazine.
   The survey showed that most foreign travelers rank good airport
security and a stable government in the destination country as most
important factors in their travel choices. Both factors were cited
by 79 percent of those surveyed. Also of importance are hospitality
in the host country, good transportation, low crime rates and
favorable exchange rates. _
   A Los Angeles hotel _ the Bel-Air _ has risen fast in the
estimation of senior financiers surveyed for their rankings of the
world's 50 best hotels by Institional Investor magazine.
   The Bel-Air was ranked fourth in the magazine's 10th annual
survey and was the first American hotel ever to place among the top
five. The hotel didn't make the list at all in any previous year.
More than 100 financiers, each averaging about 65 nights a year in
hotels, served as panelists.
   Top ranked for the ninth consecutive year was the Oriental in
Bangkok. The Vier Jahreszeiten in Hamburg was second, the Ritz in
Paris third, the Bel-Air fourth, and the Mandarin Oriental of Hong
Kong fifth. _

   Places to go, things to see and do, travel bargains to have:
   _ The sixth edition of ``Where to Find It, Buy It, Eat It in New
York'' by Gerry Frank has been updated to cover the latest in New
York City dining, shopping, sightseeing and hotels.
   The author, who lives in Washington but spends weekends in
Manhattan, lists 220 places in New York he considers best and also
includes a negative list of what he calls ``Don't Bother
Restaurants.'' He also tells how to get tickets to shows and which
are the best museums, where the bargains can be found in discount
and off-price stores, and where, if you need one, to find a chimney
sweep. Also included are instructions on how to find addresses and
read maps and how to get around the big town. _
   _ A new blues and gospel pavilion opens in December in New
Orleans, featuring two nightly performances of gospel, followed by
three blues sessions. Located between two Creole cottages at 227
Bourbon Street, the pavilion will spotlight local and national
artists, with sessions beginning at 8 p.m. and continuing until 2
a.m. every night, beginning in January. The pavilion will be open
weekends for the inaugural month of December. _
   Starting in March, rail buffs can make a Oakland-Los Angeles run
in the Princess' Super Dome rail cars which will be attached to
Amtrak's Coast Starlight trains No. 11 and 14.
   The trains will be called ``California Sun Express,'' with
passengers able to make the entire trip in one day or to choose an
overnight stopover at San Luis Obispo.
   The luxury dome cars, privately owned by Princess, already
operate through Alaska through the company's Tour Alaska
subsidiary. The cars will be outfitted in oak, brass, plush
carpeting and wool upholstery, topped by curved plate glass
windows. Chefs will prepare food on board, served in a dining salon
with linen, fine china and French stemware. _
   An ancient bayou, the great Chacahoula Swamp, is venue for day
trips operated by the Atchfalaya Basin Backwater Adventure in
Gibson, La.
   The tours explore areas with ancient cypress trees and exotic
wildlife in what was the main exit of the Mississippi into the Gulf
of Mexico 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. The tour boats travel through
rugged terrain on normally non-navigable waterways. _
   For a room with a really different view, try the Undersea Lodge
in Key Largo, Fla. It's billed as the world's only underwater
hotel, with views looking out on the water 30 feet below the lagoon
at the new Key Largo Undersea Park.
   The park enables visitors to accompany professionals exploring
the remains of a shipwreck, study and swim with more than 100
marine life species, and learn about marine conservation. _
   Five historic sites in New York's Hudson Valley are clustered
along the river north of New York City and can be taken in with day
drives or train trips from a Westchester County touring base.
   Washington Irving's home at Sunnyside and the Sleepy Hollow area
he wrote about, the water-powered grist mill and house at
Philipsburg Manor, the 18th century Van Cortlandt Manor, and the
Union Church of Pocantico Hills with stained glass windows by Henri
Matisse and Marc Chagall all are within minutes of each other along
Route 9 in the Tarrytown area.
   Montgomery Place, at Annandale-on-Hudson near Kingston, N.Y., is
a restoration in progress. The manor is the ancestral home of the
Hudson Valley's Livingston family and commands views of the river
and the Catskill Mountains.
   The properties are are managed by Historic Hudson Valley in
Tarrytown, N.Y. _
   Germany's Carnival, or ``Fasching,'' starts before Christmas and
goes on through Ash Wednesday, offering American travelers the
chance to take part in the public celebrations such as Rose Monday
in Cologne, Dusseldorf and Mainz, or the ``Munich Crazy''
celebration.
   Travel costs in Germany are lower during the winter, according
to the German National Tourist Office. At the same time, visitors
will find opera, ballet and theater at the height of their seasons.
_
   Birdwatchers traveling to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas will
find over 350 species of animals _ some found nowhere else on earth
_ at the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. It's located where two
major flyways converge, and birders cam learn of current sightings
and flyovers of rare species by contacting a hotline directed by
Father Tom Pincelli, a Catholic priest whose major hobby is
birdwatching. The number is (512) 542-4823.

   Wall Street leaders declared an end to
their lengthy battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds
business, proposing to junk the law that has governed the nation's
basic banking structure since the Depression.
   Directors of the Securities Industry Association, at the trade
group's annual convention, on Friday endorsed a proposal for new
legislation to let subsidiaries of banks ``engage in a broad range
of securities and securities-related activities.''
   At the same time, the SIA said its plan would let brokers engage
in consumer banking businesses and join banks in having access to
the Federal Reserve's banking system.

   Three major unions of United Airlines have met
with officials of parent UAL Corp. to draft a revised employee-led
buyout proposal, a company spokesman said, and the carrier's flight
attendants said a new offer will come this week.
   UAL officials have been negotiating with pilots, flight
attendants and machinists to put together a revised employee-led
buyout since New York-based investment group Coniston Partners last
month began proceedings to oust 13 of UAL's 15 director's, said
United spokesman Russell Mack.
   A previous buyout attempt led by pilots, senior management and

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge signaled a slowdown in October, but other evidence suggested
that lower interest rates will keep the economy from toppling into
a recession.
   The 0.4 percent drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators reported Friday fits in with the
consensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year and
the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best.
   However, some analysts said a number of factors mitigated the
unfavorable report.

in nine months helped boost construction spending in October, the
government said in a report suggesting lower interest rates are
helping end a construction slump.
   The Commerce Department said Friday spending rose 1 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $420.1 billion.
   The increase followed no change in September and a 1.5 percent
gain in August. Construction spending fell in July and June.

   The nation's thrift institutions continued to
shrink dramatically in September in preparation for tough new
financial standards taking effect the coming week, the government
said.
   Assets at the nation's 2,903 thrifts shrank by $15.2 billion,
breaking the record set in August of $13.3 billion, the Office of
Thrift Supervision said Friday.
   Meanwhile, a net of $8.9 billion in deposits was withdrawn from
thrifts, the most since February, which marked the second-heaviest
outflow on record. September was the 16th consecutive month of
outflows.

   The merchant shipping industry said President
Bush's decision to bar Panamanian-flag vessels from U.S. ports
could make shipowners pawns in diplomatic disputes.
   The move might interrupt free trade and prove costly and
disruptive to shipowners, industry insiders said Friday.
   Bush's ban, announced Thursday, goes into effect Jan. 31 and is

   PacifiCorp offered to acquire Pinnacle
West Capital Corp., three weeks after proposing a buyout of the
company's Arizona Public Service Co., its only profitable division.
   PacifiCorp, which has interests in electric utilities in seven
Western states, made its offer Friday contingent on the sale of
MeraBank, Pinnacle West's troubled savings bank subsidiary.
   PacifiCorp offered to exchange 0.18 of a share of its own stock
for each outstanding Pinnacle West share. Based on PacifiCorp's
current stock price the offer has an indicated value of nearly $8 a

<HEAD>Americans Planning To Spend $39 Billion on Christmas Gifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. families plan to spend an estimated $39
billion on Christmas gifts this year, up 4 percent to 5 percent
from last year, according to a survey by the Conference Board.
   In its annual Christmas spending survey, released Sunday, the
business-research organization found that American families expect
to spend an average of $335 on Christmas gifts this season, with
about half of all families spending more and half spending less.
   The figures are based on a nationwide survey of 5,000 households.
   ``The prospects of a reasonably lively Christmas season should
put to rest the irrepressible warnings that we may be moving into
recession,'' said Fabian Linden, executive director of the
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. ``As long as the
consumer maintains a good level of spending, the economy is not
likely to take a bad turn.''
   The survey again showed families in New England to be the
biggest Christmas spenders, with an average household expenditure
of $422, although that level is 11 percent lower than last year.
Families in the West South Central region _ Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Texas _ plan to spend the least on Christmas gifts, an
average $264.

   The dollar fell in early European trading today.
Gold prices also fell as much as $5.25 an ounce.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading was calm, with most
attention on the West German mark following the weekend summit
meeting in Malta between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The summit has given the mark another boost,'' said a trader
at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt, citing hopes the continuing thaw
between East and West will create new business opportunities for
West German industry.
   ``As long as the focus is on the mark, the dollar remains under
pressure,'' he said.
   A trader in Milan said the market was ``very lethargic with very
little activity ... The absence of factors to consider is
preoccupying.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 143.48 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared, with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7755 West German marks, down from 1.7825;
1.5920 Swiss francs, down from 1.5925; 6.0635 French francs, down
from 6.0875; 2.0038 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0150; 1,308.50
Italian lire, down from 1,313.25; and 1.1650 Canadian dollars, down

   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5685 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5665 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.75 a troy ounce,
down from $414.00 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $409.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.75, down from $415 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.79 to close at a bid $409.31.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index resumed its

today to 37,303.87. The previous record of 37,268.79 was set
Thursday.
   Securities dealers said the market reacted favorably to amity
shown at the U.S.-Soviet summit, and investors actively bought
shares related to business with the Soviet Union and East bloc
countries.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, which lists
most major shares, was estimated at 1.2 billion shares, compared
with Friday's 1.1 billion.
   On the currency market, the dollar closed at 143.48 yen, up 0.40
yen from Friday's close of 143.08 yen. It opened at the day's low
of 143.37 and rose to 143.70 yen in midmorning trading, but eased
in the afternoon.
   Traders said the quiet mood should continue during a week that
promises little fresh economic news to trade on until Friday's

   The market will watch Friday's report carefully for clues to
possible interest easing moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve, they
said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Defense Reductions Will Do Little for 1991 Budget
Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Battle lines in Congress are already being
drawn over whether and how to spend the money the Bush
administration plans to slice off next year's Pentagon budget.
   On one side are lawmakers who say liberalization in Eastern
Europe means the defense cuts should be large, and who want to use
the money to beef up education, child care and other domestic
programs that have been pinched in recent years.
   ``If the tearing down of the Berlin Wall means nothing more than
we put the USS Missouri in mothballs, we will not have accomplished
much,'' says liberal Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Arrayed against them are others who want to use the savings to
reduce the 1991 deficit to $64 billion, a goal universally seen as
difficult yet one that is required by the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law.
   ``There seems hardly any room for discussion that the ...
defense savings go to anything but deficit reduction,'' says Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee.
   Dangling somewhere in between are senators and representatives
who will be wary of defense cuts that affect military bases or
contractors in their home districts.
   ``The light bulb in their heads says jobs,'' says Ellen
Nissenbaum, a lobbyist for programs for low-income people.
   While Congress just finished its 1990 budget work on Nov. 22,
the administration is already sketching out its spending blueprint
for fiscal 1991, which begins next Oct. 1. That document will be
presented to Congress on Jan. 22.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is reportedly preparing budget
plans that will pare up to $180 billion from planned Pentagon
spending through 1994.
   Even if carried to the maximum, such cuts would reap little
savings next year because of the nature of defense spending.
   In any given year, much of it is carried over from previous
commitments _ such as an aircraft carrier on which construction
began two years ago _ or is contained in difficult-to-break,
long-term contracts stretching into the future. Even laying off
troops brings with it offsetting expenses such as retirement
payments, unemployment benefits and other costs.
   Because of that, the consensus among lawmakers and lobbyists is
the reductions are likely to rein military spending by no more than
$3 billion to $8 billion next year out of a nearly $300 billion
Pentagon budget. The entire federal budget will be about $1.2
trillion.
   Such savings are but a tiny fraction of the $40 billion that
many on Capitol Hill expect will be needed to shave the 1991
deficit to the Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion.
   ``The peace dividend isn't large, and there are a lot of
claimants,'' says Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., ranking Republican on
the House Budget Committee.
   Although the defense buildup of the early Reagan administration
years left a lasting public impression of an ever-growing Pentagon,
the military budget has shrunk over the last five years when the
effects of inflation are considered.
   The trend was considered likely to continue in 1991 even before
Cheney began considering reductions and Eastern European countries
began asserting more political independence from the Soviet bloc.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., predicted ``a feeding
frenzy'' last week by lawmakers eager to cut defense spending if
the administration asks for a budget reduction.
   But there's little question that the nation's defense system _
its bases and the companies that supply the weapons, food and other
goods for them _ has a large base of support in Congress.
   Even so, the need for deficit-reduction is likely to lead
lawmakers to take a bite out of the military budget. The fight over
reaching the Gramm-Rudman deficit target is likely to also focus on
elements that have been contested in recent budget years: higher
taxes, which Bush opposes, and domestic cuts, which Democrats
reject.
   ``A responsible budget approach has to be balanced,'' says Rep.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif., House Budget Committee chairman, who has
issued similar calls in the past with limited success.

<HEAD>Maxwell Sets May as New Target Date for Start of European Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Robert Maxwell said Monday his new
newspaper, The European, will begin publishing on May 11, 1990, one
year later than originally planned.
   The newspaper, first planned as a daily, will be published
weekly, on Fridays, and will be printed in Britain, Germany,
Hungary and other unspecified countries, Maxwell said in a
statement.
   Maxwell, owner of Mirror Group Newspapers, said the broadsheet
English-language paper will be sold throughout Europe for the
equivalent of 78 cents and will include news, pictures, sports and
financial services.
   Maxwell said in March the paper would begin publishing this
autumn, instead of May as originally planned. He said at the time
research had convinced him the paper should begin as a weekly 'to
establish a base from which daily publication could begin.''
   He said then that differences between the French and British
executives of The European were part of the reason for postponing
its launch.
   Maxwell said Monday the newspaper's editor would be Ian Watson,
now deputy editor of London's Sunday Telegraph.
   Maxwell runs a publishing business in 28 countries with 40,000
employees, including Macmillan Inc., the U.S. publishing company.

   To Konrad Trojniar the pension dispute with
his ex-employer turns on principles of justice and loyalty, but the
opposing lawyers in the case of Continental Can Inc. are trading
charges of racketeering, terrorizing and coercion.
   Trojniar, now 49, is among some 2,500 former Continental
employees who are suing the company in a class action arguing that
they were laid off to prevent them from becoming eligible to
collect pensions.
   ``In other words, they weren't loyal to us,'' said Trojniar, of
Hinsdale, Ill. ``I would like to get what I got coming.''
   Last May, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin sided with them.
   But the workers haven't seen a dime as the company appeals the
ruling and a fight has broken out over how much should be paid to
whom.
   In the meantime, Trojniar, who was laid off in 1978 just two
years short of pension eligibility, is earning $5.50 an hour as a
maintenance man at a Chicago chemical company. That's half of what
he made feeding an aerosol can press for Continental.
   ``I gave them the good years, so to speak,'' he said.
   In its appeal Continental says Sarokin improperly extended his
ruling from one plant to 46, allowed workers to join the class
indiscriminately and ignored previous case law.
   The ex-workers' attorneys say the cost to Continental could run
to $1 billion. The other side expects a settlement in the $50
million range, said a source familiar with court proceedings who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. Attorneys said there was
little progress on a settlement.
   The dispute, involving dozens of attorneys at prominent firms
nationwide, took a rancorous turn in October. The workers filed
papers accusing Continental's owner, Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons Inc., of
siphoning off more than $1 billion from Continental to avoid having
to pay a potentially huge judgment.
   Last month, Kiewit agreed to submit certain asset transfers or
dividend payments to the judge's review. The company denies seeking
to transfer funds to avoid paying a judgment.
   The workers' amended lawsuit also adds individual executives and
Kiewit parent companies as defendants on a claim of racketeering.
An attorney for the workers, Robert Plotkin of Chicago, said that
action was intended to hold the Kiewit companies accountable for
their subsidiaries' responsibilities.
   But Continental attorney Edwin C. Thomas said that accusing the
Kiewit companies and individuals of racketeering is a ``coercive,
terrorizing event'' designed to inflate the amount of money the
workers would receive in a settlement. Under the racketeering law,
the defendants could be found liable for triple damages if they
lose.
   Thomas also accused the lawyers of making the funds transfer
allegation as a way to attack the company under cover of court
papers, ``without facing any slander or defamation charges.''
   The workers' court papers said that from the end of 1984, the
year of its purchase, Continental's net worth dropped from $1.5
billion to $311 million by last March.
   Assets were sold to pay off loans for Kiewit's leveraged buyout
of Continental, the court papers said. In addition, the workers
contended, huge dividends were paid to Continental's parent _
amounting to $634 million in 1986 alone, when net earnings were $93
million.
   But Kiewit Continental Inc. general counsel Stephen Bermas said
assets were sold to pay off debt as in any other leveraged buyout,
and many of them were non-can related, such as insurance, oil and
gas and timberland interests.
   ``Whatever transfer of funds from Continental Can that occurred
were fully explainable by other good, legitimate business reasons
that had no relation whatsoever to this lawsuit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Award Accounting Firm Ordered to Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $1.24
million award a leading accounting firm was ordered to pay to a
water heater manufacturer.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Ernst &amp;
Whinney, the accounting firm sued successfuly by Bradford-White
Corp., which makes water heaters at a Middleville, Mich., plant.
   Bradford-White, a Tennessee corporation, in 1981 bought out
another water heater manufacturer, W.L. Jackson of Chattanooga,
Tenn. In connection with that deal, Bradford-White accused Ernst &amp;
Whinney, the accountants for Jackson, of falsely reporting
Jackson's financial condition.
   The accounting firm had reported Jackson was in financial
trouble. But Bradford-White said Ernst &amp; Whinney concealed just how
bad matters were, and contended that Jackson was on the verge of
bankruptcy. The lawsuit alleged that Ernst &amp; Whinney violated
federal and Tennessee securities laws.
   Bradford-White was awarded $1.24 million by a federal jury in
Philadelphia. Bradford-White has offices in that city.
   A federal judge later overturned the award, ruling that the
verdict was inconsisent with some of the jury's own finding.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the award
last April.
   The appeals court said there might have been some
inconsistencies, but there is no doubt the jury believed Ernst &amp;
Whinney misstated Jackson's net worth.
   The appeals court also rejected the accounting firm's claim that
Bradford-White waited too long to sue.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney waived any such claim at the trial and cannot
rely on it on appeal, the 3rd Circuit court said.
   The case is Ernst &amp; Whinney vs. Bradford-White Corp., 89-604.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
reversed a two-week slide with sharp increases in Texas and
Oklahoma to total 1,062, up 25 from a week ago.
   The latest rig count, compiled by Baker Hughes Inc. and reported
Monday, is 157 ahead of a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas with 19 and Oklahoma
with 16, showed the largest gains. Wyoming was up eight, Kansas
seven and Pennsylvania one.
   States showing declines included California, down six; Colorado,
down five; Louisiana, off four, Michigan and North Dakota, each
down three, and Ohio, off one.
   New Mexico was unchanged.

   Details of a new employee-led buyout plan for UAL
Corp. are expected to be presented this week to at least one of
United Airlines' three major unions, union officials said.
   The move would follow ongoing negotiations between UAL and
unions for United's flight attendants, pilots and machinists aimed
at refashioning a bid for the parent company.
   Expectations that a revised bid would be forthcoming sent UAL
stock sharply higher this morning. It surged $5 to $179 a share by
noon on the New York Stock Exchange, adding to Friday's jump of
$12.50.
   Negotiations have taken place with all three unions since the
New York-based investment group Coniston Partners last month began
proceedings to oust 13 of the company's 15 directors, United
spokesman Russell Mack said Sunday.
   In a recorded message to employees, the flight attendants on
Friday said that negotiations between their union and company
negotiators would resume Wednesday.
   At the meeting, ``top United management is expected to present
us with details of a new employee ownership plan,'' with similar
presentations expected in meetings with the pilots and machinists,
the recording said.
   Patricia Friend, outgoing president of the flight attendants'
union, said today she did not know when those meetings are
scheduled, and spokesmen for the other two unions could not be
reached early today to comment.
   Ms. Friend said that while a revised buyout plan may be
presented at Wednesday's meeting, ``We're a long way away from an
agreement that would require a vote.''
   Mack declined to comment on whether an offer would be presented
to the flight attendants or other employees this week.
   Louis Marckesano, of the Philadelphia brokerage Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc., said the ``odds are pretty good'' that UAL
is working quickly to wrap up a new deal with employees.
   A previous buyout attempt led by pilots, senior management and
British Airways PLC failed in October when bank financing fell
through for the $300-a-share, $6.75 billion offer.
   The resignations this weekend of two officers of the flight
attendants union _ Friend and Vice President Carol Holmes _ could
also mean a deal is near, Marckesano said.
   ``The flight attendants have not been as cooperative under
(Friend and Holmes),'' Marckesano said Sunday in a telephone
interview. ``This may be a sign that perhaps they are easing their
stance.''
   Mack said Sunday in a telephone interview that ``discussions
have been taking place since the Coniston Partners announced they
are going ahead on the consent solicitation bid.''
   Coniston has boosted its UAL stake to 11.8 percent from 9.7
percent, general partner Keith Gollust said today, but he declined
comment on the buyout situation.
   The group has said only that it intends to pursue an
``extraordinary transaction'' to benefit UAL investors if it wins
control of the company's board with the permission of shareholders.
   Friend and Holmes announced their resignations to United's
14,000-member Association of Flight Attendants on Friday, saying
the time has come for new leadership to step in to deal with a new
ESOP and stalled contract talks.
   Marckesano warned, however, that consent from the nearly
25,000-member machinists union will be key to any revised buyout
offer.
   Opposition from the machinists to the previous buyout offer led
in part to the banks' decision to withdraw financing.
   ``They still need outside financing, even if they do strike a
deal with the unions,'' Marckesano said. ``It's got to come from
the banks in the form of loans and equity contributions or from
individual groups, such as the pilots.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as a lack of news over the
weekend reduced interest in the market.
   ``There was not a lot of news over the weekend,'' to stimulate
buying interest, said analyst Steve Freed of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago
   A lack of export demand for U.S. soybeans and favorable weather
in South American crop areas put pressure on soybean futures, Freed
said.
   Corn prices were lower, despite Friday's announcement of a
purchase by the Soviet Union. Analysts say that news had been
factored into the market.
   Also, word that the Soviet Union has bid for 400,000 metric tons
of wheat under the export bonus program failed to lift wheat prices
today.
   Analysts said investors were awaiting the outcome of this week's
U.S.-Soviet grain talks to determine the level of Soviet buying
interest.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.06 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.32\ a bushel; oats were
a \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 4{ cents lower with January at $5.72\ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were generally lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork prices were pressured by lower hog cash prices due to light
packer demand and profit taking by investors in frozen pork bellies.
   Live cattle futures were pushed lower by expectations of lower
cash prices for fed cattle this week, a traditional period of low
weak retail beef demand.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent lower with December at 75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher
with January at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with December at 50.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .22 cent lower to unchanged with February at 57.50
cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher and pork prices lower in
Friday's trading.

   United Arab Emirates oil minister Mana
Said Otaiba said Monday his country was ready to limit its oil
output, but not to the extent demanded by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Otaiba said the United Arab Emirates was willing to reduce its
current output, which he put at 2.6 million barrels a day, to under
2 million during the first half of 1990.
   But he stressed it would not accept a quota of 1.094 million
barrels a day assigned under an OPEC pact, reached last week.
   He said the United Arab Emirates was willing to limit production
to under 2 million barrels a day if the other OPEC nations abide by
their quotas.
   The 13 OPEC members agreed last week to set their output ceiling
at 22 million barrels a day. It left the quota for the United Arab
Emirates, which has not complied with its OPEC quota over the past
two years, unchanged.
   Otaiba also said he expects demand for OPEC crude to exceed 23
million barrels a day in 1990, higher than the group's own demand
estimates.
   He said continued economic growth should keep demand strong.
Moreover, recent upheaval in eastern Europe could help spur demand
by touching off new economic growth there, he said.

<HEAD>Strike Enters 10th Month, Talks With Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Eastern Airlines
Machinists, whose walkout entered its 10th month Monday, says there
is new dialogue with management but that his membership remains
committed to the strike.
   ``There's no way you can just blink away the trauma that people
have been through,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of the
Machinists District 100. ``I believe that most everybody looks at
it that they've invested nine months and they don't want to lose
that. We've stayed solid so long.''
   Bryan disclosed that he had a three-hour meeting last Thursday
in Washington with Eastern officials and federal mediator Harry
Bickford.
   All agreed ``that nobody will put any spins on it,'' Bryan said.
``We met, and we'll have more meetings.''
   Company spokesman Robin Matell confirmed the meeting with Tom
Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human resources, and
Al Gibson, vice president for labor relations.
   ``They agreed to maintain a dialogue,'' Matell said.
   He wouldn't give any other details. He said the meeting was the
company's first with the Machinists union since Oct. 13.
   The latest session came the week after the Air Line Pilots
Association and the Transport Workers Union, representing flight
attendants, called off their sympathy strikes. They had joined the
8,500 mechanics and other Eastern ground workers represented by the
Machinists in walking out March 4 when 1{ years of federally
mediated talks.
   Matell said management met Monday with the flight attendants
union, will meet again Friday, and plans four days of negotiations
beginning Dec. 18. The company is waiting to hear from a federal
mediator on the next round of talks with the pilots, Matell said.
   The pilots and flight attendants are in negotiations on new
contracts and also on the return to work of their members.
   Bryan said the other unions' actions didn't affect his union's
strike. He noted that Eastern told the returning strikers they had
no jobs for them and they would have to go on a waiting list.
   ``I think it certainly was predictable that they are playing the
hardest of hardball, in the most arrogant way. (Eastern has been)
very condescending, saying: `We don't have any jobs but we might do
them a favor and take some of them back.' ''
   Bryan, who contends that Chairman Frank Lorenzo has been out to
break Eastern's unions and cannibalize the carrier since his Texas
Air Corp. bought it nearly four years ago, has portrayed the
unions' struggle in terms of good versus evil. He now draws
comparisons to Eastern Europe.
   Bryan denied that his union's talk of going underground implied
illegal activity. Eastern last week gained a preliminary injunction
ordering the Machinists to refrain from harassment, threats and
trespassing.
   Bryan said the union plans a range of activities that includes
an organized effort to urge anyone associated with the travel
industry to boycott Eastern and Texas Air.
   The company says it has 2,800 mechanics, including about 300
Machinists who have crossed picket lines, and rejects suggestions
of maintenance difficulties.
   There were some 4,500 Machinists mechanics who struck.
   Bryan was interviewed here Sunday after attending the Florida
Democratic Party's conference. He chatted with House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, who urged him to keep up his fight because
``it's important for this country.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as commission house selling
dominated trading activity.
   Continued concern over the lack of export sales weighed on the
market, said analyst William Biedermann of Allendale Inc. in
Chicago.
   Indications from South America that soybean crops will have
adequate soil moisture to get off to a good growing start was a
major drag on prices, Biedermann said. Previously dry areas in
Argentina received rain during the weekend.
   A big selloff by professionals holding long positions in wheat
was due to a National Weather Service forecast of precipitation in
the winter wheat crop belt, analysts said. The region had been
plagued by dry weather in recent weeks.
   Corn futures traded in a narrow range as speculators liquidated
to take profits as overall weakness in the market influenced corn
prices, Biedermann said.
   At the close, wheat prices were 4\ cents to 7 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December $4.04 a bushel; corn was a \
cent to 2 cents lower with December at $2.32{ a bushel; oats were a
\ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 4} cents lower with January at $5.72\ a bushel.

   M. Danny Wall resigned today as the
government's chief regulator of savings and loans, saying he was
made a ``scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift
crisis'' and the record bailout of the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association.
   As he has done before, Wall insisted at a packed news conference
and in his resignation letter to President Bush that he did nothing
wrong and leaves with ``personal integrity that will stand up to
any scrutiny.'' But he said the fact that he was the ``primary
target'' of a congressional investigation would create a hardship
at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which he directed.
   Wall complained about a ``steady stream of one-sided information
emanating from the House Banking Committee hearings concerning my
handling of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.''
   He specifically cited Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of
the House Banking Committee, whom he accused of resorting to
``corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historical
devotion to fair play and due process in his effort to remove me
from office,''
   Gonzalez said Wall had ``done the best thing for himself and the
federal regulatory system ... The savings and loan disaster has
been extremely costly in terms of dollars and public confidence. It
was essential that there be new leadership.''
   For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target of
hearings by the House Banking Committee into why federal regulators
allowed Lincoln to remain open until last April even though
examiners had recommended in May 1987 that it be closed. The
bailout of the Irvine, Calif., institution is expected to cost
taxpayers up to $2.5 billion.
   Wall has maintained there was not enough evidence to seize
Lincoln and has dismissed allegations that he declined to act
because of political pressure from five senators who intervened on
behalf of Lincoln and Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's
parent company, American Continental Corp.
   ``As I testified under oath, neither political influence nor
Lincoln's Charles Keating affected my decision on Lincoln,'' Wall
said in his resignation letter. ``Nor for that matter have I ever
made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman
and director.''
   Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles
and he is the target of a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit
brought by federal regulators.
   Wall said, ``The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to
shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics
to join in the hue and cry raised by the House Banking Committee
chairman for my departure from office.''
   Wall testified for 10 hours before Gonzalez's committee in late
November. Following Wall's appearance, Gonzalez said of his
testimony, ``somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge
regulatory bureaucracy could do nothing, did nothing, as the
institution (Lincoln) went down.''
   Wall said he did not like running from a fight, but he was
unwilling to continue battling his critics at the risk of harming
the Bush administration.
   ``The recent hearings consumed a great deal of our energies as
we prepared our response and the prospect of continued hearings
with me as the primary target would cause disruption at OTS at a
time when the agency staff needs to devote its attention to
revitalizing the thrift industry,'' Wall said.
   Wall was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July
1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new Office
of Thrift Supervision.
   Wall's resignation came amid a flood of calls for his
resignation or ouster, among them Gonzalez, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine; several public interest groups and major
newspapers.
   ``Time will indeed be kind to us,'' Wall predicted in a
television interview Nov. 26, saying that two congressional
investigations of the Lincoln collapse would prove his decisions
justified. In the same interview he conceded making mistakes in
handling the Lincoln case but said he had no plan ``at this point''
to resign.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is reviewing the conduct of the five
senators: Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of Arizona, John Glenn
of Ohio, Alan Cranston of California and Donald Riegle of Michigan,
the chairman of the Senate Banking Commitee. McCain is a
Republican, the others Democrats.
   Under the S&amp;L bailout legislation passed in August, Wall's term
extends until July 1, 1991. He was chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board and as part of the legislative package was named
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which replaced the
bank board as the regulator of thrifts.
   The office is an arm of the Treasury Department.

   Larry Dugan Jr., president of the
330,000-member International Union of Operating Engineers the past
four years, announced Monday that he would step down effective Feb.
1.
   Dugan, 59, will be succeeded by Frank Hanley, also 59, a New
York City native who has been the union's No. 2 official, general
secretary treasurer, since 1979. From 1975-79 Hanley was a union
vice president.
   Dugan, president of the union since 1985, gave no reason for his
resignation. He informed the union's board of his decision at a
meeting Monday.
   Hanley had mounted an unusual protest in 1985 when Dugan was
hand-picked to succeed J.C. Turner as president, writing other
union leaders and requesting an open election. But he dropped the
request after meeting with Dugan.
   Dugan, of Phoenix, last month was re-elected to another two-year
term on the AFL-CIO's Executive Council, the labor federation's
governing body. It was unclear Monday whether he would complete
that term or ask that Hanley be allowed to take his place.

<HEAD>Merged Company Announces 12 Percent Pre-tax Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pharmaceuticals giant SmithKline Beecham PLC,
reporting its first results since a merger earlier this year, said
Monday that its nine-month pre-tax profit rose 12 percent.
   The company did not provide net profit and earnings per share.
It also did not specify third-quarter results. SmithKline said the
statement was a ``progress report'' rather than a full earnings
announcement.
   Britain's Beecham Group PLC and Philadelphia-based SmithKline
Beckman Corp. merged in July through an exchange of shares,
creating the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company after
Rahway, N.J.-based Merck and Co. SmithKline Beecham said its
pre-tax profit for the nine months ended Sept. 30 came to 587.3
million pounds, or the equivalent $920 million, compared with 524.3
million pounds, or $822 million, in the same period a year ago.
   Nine-month trading profit rose 15.9 percent to 626.5 million
pounds from 540.6 million pounds, the company said.
   Sales from continuing operations rose 18 percent to 3.2 billion
pounds from 2.7 billion pounds. Sales were boosted by a 19 percent
increase in U.S. sales of the anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, the company
said.
   The company used a rate of exchange of $1.5672 per British
pound, the rate at the start of trading in London on Monday. The
company consolidated the pre-merger earnings for comparison
purposes.
   ``The quality of our trading performance during this first
reporting period of the new company provides a strong foundation
upon which we can build,'' company chairman Henry Wendt said in a
statement.
   SmithKline Beecham's next official results, for the full year
ending Dec. 31, aren't due until March. British companies
traditionally report earnings twice a year, while American
companies issue reports quarterly.

   Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross, two of
the country's biggest accounting firms, completed a merger of their
U.S. operations on Monday.
   A final agreement uniting the two accounting and professional
services firms was signed in New York.
   The combined company in the United States, called Deloitte &amp;
Touche, will have 19,700 partners and employees working at 100
offices around the country, the firms said in a news release.
   Deloitte &amp; Touche will rank third among the Big Six acccounting
firms based on projected 1989 revenue of $1.9 billion, they said.
   The new firm is part of a wider international partnership being
formed and to be known as Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu.
   J. Michael Cook, Deloitte &amp; Touche chief executive officer, said
the international merger is scheduled to be completed on Jan. 2.
   Efforts by Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross
International to create a worldwide link had suffered a setback
earlier in the autumn when the British arm of Deloitte decided to
join forces with a different accounting firm.
   The British partners of Deloitte Haskins and Coopers &amp; Lybrand
in October announced a plan to merge, creating Britain's largest
accounting firm with about 10,500 employees and fee income of about
$670 million a year.
   Deloitte &amp; Touche said Monday that international member firms of
Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu recently met in New York and approved
formation of the new company.
   The organization will have members in Australia, Canada, Hong
Kong, Japan, France, Italy, the Middle East, Latin America, the
Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, West Germany and
elsewhere.

   A revised employee buyout proposal being readied
by UAL Corp. executives could value the parent of United Airlines
at between $4.75 billion and $5.42 billion, sharply lower than an
earlier, aborted proposal, analysts said Monday.
   Analysts said a new bid, the successor to the failed $6.75
billion buyout led by United's pilots union and management, might
be unveiled in time for consideration at a scheduled Dec. 13
meeting of UAL's board of directors.
   UAL representatives are expected to present details of a new
buyout plan to United's flight attendants' union on Wednesday.
   The company has met recently with U.S. and Japanese bankers,
representatives of the United pilots' union and Coniston Partners,
an investor group that is pushing for a sale or restructuring of
UAL.
   UAL stock rose $5.50 a share to $179.50 in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading, adding to Friday's $12.50 a share gain.
   Patricia Friend, outgoing president of the United chapter of the
Association of Flight Attendants, said Monday that a revised buyout
plan may be presented at this week's meeting.
   But she added: ``We're a long way away from an agreement that
would require a vote.''
   Nevertheless, airline industry analysts and stock-market
investors speculated that the pieces of a new bid were falling
rapidly into place. Chicago-based UAL told its employees on Friday
that executives were working on a revised proposal for employee
purchase of the airline company.
   ``It looks like they're really trying to put together a takeover
deal here,'' said Stephen Dexter, an analyst in Chicago with Kemper
Financial Services Inc.
   The $300 a share offer from the pilots, UAL senior management
and British Airways PLC fell through after the group failed to get
the necessary financing. Since then, UAL stock has traded sharply
lower.
   Dexter figured the new deal would be for $210 to $240 a share.
Another analyst said he had spoken with a United pilot who ``threw
out a $220 number.''
   Analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said lenders
who balked at and doomed the $300-a-share offer probably would
agree to finance a deal at $225.
   UAL management is believed to be seeking strong commitments from
lenders and the company's three major unions before announcing a
revised buyout effort.
   The earlier pilot-management bid failed in October when lenders
refused to finance it, citing the strong opposition of the
Machinists union. The Machinists represent about 25,000 of UAL's
70,000 employees.
   United pilots long have sought ownership of the carrier, the
nation's second-largest, and are believed to be working with
management on the new proposal. Spokesman Hank Krakowski of the
United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, declined comment
Monday.
   Brian Freeman, an adviser to the Machinists union, said no
meetings between representatives of his union and UAL had been held
recently and he knew of none scheduled.
   Officials of the Machinists union in Washington and California
did not return telephone calls.
   UAL spokesman Russell Mack said the company's financial advisers
already had met with the pilots and were planning to meet with the
flight attendants, who also had not joined the earlier
pilots-management buyout group. He said he did not know whether the
advisers had met with the Machinists.
   The company is being pressed toward a sale or restructuring by
Coniston, the New York-based investor group that is threatening to
launch a drive for shareholder consent to oust 13 of the company's
15 directors and create a five-member board.
   Coniston has boosted its UAL stake to 11.8 percent of the
company's outstanding common shares from 9.7 percent, general
partner Keith Gollust said Monday. Gollust declined comment on the
buyout situation.
   He said Coniston had been in contact with UAL and the unions and
was holding back on launching its consent solicitation.
   ``We are monitoring the situation closely,'' Gollust said in a
telephone interview. ``We will commence our consent solicitation if
and when we conclude it would be advantageous.''

   The stock market rose Monday, but its advance
failed to pack the punch of Friday's impressive rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials advanced 5.98 points to
2,753.63, its ninth-highest close ever.
   Advancing issues edged out declining ones by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 810 issues up, 708 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 150.36 million
shares, down from 199.20 million in Friday's session.
   Analysts said the market was buoyed mainly by takeover
speculation involving several stocks and strength in technology
issues. Investors' hopes for lower interest rates, which had
catapulted Wall Street higher last Friday and lifted the Dow Jones
average 41.38 points, appeared less solid on Monday.
   ``A lot of focus is on the Federal Reserve,'' said Hugh Johnson,
senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   The market will have to see Friday's scheduled government report
on unemployment in November before regaining confidence that the
Fed will ease credit by nudging interest rates lower, he said.
   Wall Street also seemed a bit disappointed with the results of
the U.S.-Soviet summit this past weekend, analysts said. Hopes for
the summit had helped spark Friday's rally.
   The market shrugged off Monday's report by the Commerce
Department that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
fell 0.2 percent in October to their lowest level since July.
   ``The market is an even-keel affair,'' said Larry Wachtel, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Nothing positive nor
negative.''
   The factory orders report was the latest indicator showing the
economy slowing as the year draws to an end. The manufacturing
sector has been particularly weak, prompting concern of possible
layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate.
   Traders also were unperturbed by news that M. Danny Wall, under
fire for his handling of the costliest savings and loan failure in
history, resigned as the government's chief S&amp;L regulator.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, USX jumped 3 to 37}
amid continued speculation that investor Carl Icahn is preparing a
takeover proposal as part of his effort to force a major
restructuring of the steel and energy company. IBM rose 2[ to 99\,
Chevron was up { at 70~ and Mattel advanced 1| to 18~.
   United Airlines' parent UAL surged 5\ to 179\ following news
that investment group Condor Partners has raised its stake in UAL
to 11.8 percent and is holding talks with the company and its major
unions. The airline's pilots and top managers have been trying to
buy the company for several months.
   Exxon was down \ at 48[ and Windmere lost { at 8{.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 182.96 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $6.03 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.41 at 194.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.85 to 401.52, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.78 at 351.41.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
advanced 1.18 to 458.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 0.92 to 374.66.

   International Business Machines Corp. called a
meeting for analysts Tuesday amid speculation that the company was
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility
closings.
   IBM declined to comment on the substance of the meeting but a
spokesman indicated it would be important.
   IBM has a 40-year tradition of no layoffs, and a senior IBM
executive last week confirmed that the company would stick to that.
However, if the company closed an operation such as a plant, office
or distribution center, many employees might choose to quit rather
than accept a transfer to a distant location.
   IBM normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives
to employees to quit or take early retirement. Earlier this year
the company began its third such program in three years, hoping to
trim 6,000 to 1,000 manufacturing jobs.
   IBM's stock rose $2.12{ a share to $99.25 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock peaked at $175.87{ in August 1987.

   Orders to U.S. factories dropped 0.2 percent
in October, the second straight monthly decline, the government
said Monday in its latest report on the sluggishness gripping the
industrial sector of the economy.
   ``It really corresponds with what is happening in the economy,''
said David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National
Mortgage Association.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $233.9
billion following a revised 1 percent decline in September.
September originally was reported to be unchanged following a 2.8
percent increase in August.
   The level of orders was the lowest since $230.4 billion were
written last July.
   Durable goods _ ``big-ticket'' items that are expected to last
more than three years _ fell 1.3 percent to $123.6 billion. Since
they often are financed through loans, they have born the brunt of
high interest rates resulting from Federal Reserve efforts to slow
the economy and contain inflation.
   ``In manufacturing, the durable part is really hurting badly,
primarily because autos are doing so poorly now,'' Berson said.
``The non-durable portion of the economy is not doing terribly
because consumption spending on non-durables really is pretty
strong.''
   Non-durable orders were up 1.1 percent to $110.3 billion, led by
gains in foods, chemicals and tobacco products.
   Automobile sales have fallen steadily since car makers began the
new model year in October by dropping incentives and posting higher
sticker prices. But despite the decline in auto sales,
transportation orders rose 1.7 percent because of increases in
orders for commercial aircraft and defense shipbuilding.
   Excluding transportation, however, orders would have fallen 0.5
percent. Without the defense category, orders would have been up
0.3 percent. Orders in the volatile defense category declined 12.1
percent in October.
   Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent to $232.2
billion, while inventories rose 0.3 percent to $371.9 billion.
   If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new
orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
   Machine industries led the decline in durable goods orders.
Non-electrical machinery dropped 6.7 percent, with office and
computing equipment accounting for nearly 40 percent of the drop.
Electrical machinery orders were off 4.1 percent, much of the
decline concentrated in communications equipment.
   Primary metals orders were down 3.2 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders rose 1.2 percent _ the first
increase since a 5.9 percent gain last July.

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Monday as traders renewed their interest in the West
German mark.
   Gold prices tumbled more than $12 an ounce, retreating after a
strong advance recently. Traders said last week that bullion was
getting overvalued and that such a drop was possible.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
dropped $12.50 a troy ounce to $401.10. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $401.20 as of 4
p.m. EST, $12.30 lower than Friday's late bid.
   Marc Chandler of Money Market Services International in Chicago
said currency dealers directed attention mainly to the West German
mark and bought on speculation that the country will have to raise
interest rates to stem a possible surge in economic growth.
   The Swiss franc was weighed down by heavy selling pressure
related to Switzerland's lower interest rates compared with its
European neighbors, particularly West Germany, Chandler said.
   Trading in dollars is expected to be light this week ahead of
Friday's potentially market-moving report on U.S. unemployment.
   A government report that said U.S. factory orders fell 0.2
percent in October evoked little reaction among dollar traders
although it reinforced the notion that economic growth is sluggish.
   Currency dealers overseas, meanwhile, were said to be closing
out positions before the year end. Market volume tends to dry up
toward the end of the year, when dealers are hesitant to risk
profits or add to losses.
   Dealers also were expected to remain reluctant to trade heavily
while they assess the outcome of the weekend's superpower summit
and what it will mean for the future of the dollar and the world
economy.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.48 Japanese yen from
143.08 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose further to
143.57 yen and, in New York, the dollar rose to 143.65 from 143.40
late Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5638 from $1.5665 late
Friday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.56225 from $1.5625 late
Friday.
   Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
quotes included: 1.78425 West German marks, down from 1.7865;
1.6065 Swiss francs, up from 1.5995; 6.0915 French francs, down
from 6.1020; 1,314.50 Italian lire, down from 1,316.50; and 1.16365
Canadian dollars, down from 1.6505.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday were: 1.7808 West German marks, down from 1.7825; 1.5995
Swiss francs, up from 1.5925; 6.0800 French francs, down from
6.0875; 2.0095 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0150; 1,312.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,313.25; and 1.1640 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1662.
   Precious metals prices declined in what dealers described as a
technically motivated correction to a powerful runup.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $406.25 a troy ounce
from $414 bid late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing
bid of $408 from $415 bid late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold
fell $2.79 to close at $409.31.
   Silver for current delivery slid to $5.509 a troy ounce from
$5.663 on New York's Comex. Silver bullion fell in London to a late
bid price of $5.60 a troy ounce from $5.70 bid late Friday.

   Some 40,000 NYNEX Corp. workers returned to work
Monday, 116 days after they began a bitter strike, and began
tackling a tremendous backlog on phone installations.
   ``Everybody's now back to work. We are delighted to see them
all. The priority is attacking this backlog,'' said NYNEX spokesman
John Bonomo.
   Members of the Communication Workers of America at NYNEX and its
subsidiary New York Telephone and 20,000 members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers at New England
Telephone struck the regional telephone company on Aug. 6. The
strike affected 10 million customers.
   Officials of the Communications Workers of America had predicted
widespread animosity when their members returned, but that
apparently was not the case Monday.
   ``People are reporting back to work with a few minor incidents
that have not led to anything serious,'' said Ron Woods, CWA area
director for downstate New York.
   That week other strikes began in 20 states and all were resolved
by September except for the one at NYNEX.
   The IBEW returned to work Nov. 20 after its members and the CWA
reached agreement with NYNEX on regional issues. Local issues
continued to hang up the CWA negotiations until Nov. 23.
   A ratification vote ended Friday with 85 percent of the members
approving the contract.
   New York Telephone said it was trying to fill more than 100,000
service orders and a potential backlog of another 150,000
installations with customers who withheld orders during the work
stoppage.
   Filling those orders will take until May, the company said.
Repair work, it said, is up to date.
   To clear the backlog, New York Telephone initiated a five-point
program that includes increasing its installation workforce by
nearly 50 percent.

   Cold weather in parts of the nation helped boost
heating oil futures prices Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Prices of other energy futures, including crude oil and unleaded
gasoline, closed mixed.
   No. 2 home heating oil for January delivery advanced 0.88 cent
to 63.79 cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery through June posted
gains of between 0.09 cent and 0.65 cent.
   Energy analysts said strength in London's gasoil market spilled
over into U.S. markets as low water levels on the Rhine River
continued to disrupt shipments. Gasoil is the British equivalent of
heating oil.
   ``It creates logistical problems and gives our market a higher
call,'' said Jack Unger, energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Icy temperatures in some parts of the country also gave the
heating oil market a lift, he said.
   Profit-taking, meanwhile, erased the gains in the crude oil
pits. The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 5 cents to $20.25 a
barrel after trading as high as $20.62 during the session.
   Contracts for later delivery closed narrowly mixed.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.41
cent higher at 52.52 cents a gallon, while later contracts posted
slightly smaller gains.

   International Business Machines Corp. called a
meeting for analysts Tuesday amid speculation that the company was
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility
closings.
   IBM declined to comment on the substance of the meeting but a

   IBM has a 40-year tradition of no layoffs and a senior IBM
executive last week confirmed that the company would stick to that.
However, if the company closed an operation such as a plant, office
or distribution center, many employees might choose to quit rather
than accept a transfer to a distant location.
   Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research Inc. in Phoenix,
predicted IBM might announce plans to eliminate about 20,000 jobs,
paying for the streamlining program with a charge of perhaps more
than $1 billion against fourth-quarter earnings.
   ``IBM has been competing with a layer of fat around the waist
for too long,'' Djurdjevic said. He said he thought trimming of
sales forces was more likely than facility closings.
   IBM normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives
to employees to quit or take early retirement. Earlier this year
the company began its third such program in three years, hoping to

   M. Danny Wall, under fire for his handling of
what may become the costliest savings and loan failure in history,
resigned Monday as the government's chief S&amp;L regulator.
   In his letter of resignation to President Bush, Wall complained
he was being made ``a scapegoat'' for the problems of the entire
industry and denounced a ``steady stream of one-sided information''
from congressional hearings concerning the collapse of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, has blamed Wall for allowing Lincoln to remain open
until last April even though government examiners had recommended
in May 1987 that it be closed. The bailout of the institution is
expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion.
   In turn, Wall criticized Gonzalez on Monday, saying he
``resorted to corruption of the truth'' in trying to force the
regulator out.
   Wall's departure brought expressions of relief from Congress and
the Bush administration.
   Gonzalez said in a statement, ``I know this was a difficult
decision, but I commend him for taking the action so that the air
may be cleared and we may move forward in dealing with the savings
and loan crisis.'' He made no mention of Wall's accusations.
   Another committee member, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said
Wall ``deserves to go'' but added that he ``should not be held as
the scepagoat for the thrift mess.''
   Wall's mentor, Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, who brought him to
Washington in 1975 as his chief aide, said Wall was ``a man of
unquestionably solid character and integrity'' but was ``a
convenient target for the critics who sought a scapegoat for the
serious problems in the thrift industry.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, whose department oversees
Wall's Office of Thrift Supervision, commended the regulator's
decision to step down as ``public spirited.''
   He added, ``We are beginning the search for a new OTS director
and are committed to a smooth transition and the uninterrupted
continuation of the agency's important work.''
   According to an industry source, three candidates favored by the
Treasury Department are Richard F. Syron, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston; William H. Roelle, who is in charge of S&amp;L
rescue deals at the Resolution Trust Corp., and William Taylor, a
senior regulatory official at the Federal Reserve Board now serving
as an adviser to the administration board that oversees the RTC.
   Wall set no firm date for his departure, saying he would stay on
for a transition period. He said he was looking forward to a job
out of government but had no specific position in mind.
   For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target of
hearings by Gonzalez's panel. At first, only Gonzalez called for
his resignation, but in recent weeks the committee chairman was
joined by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, private
groups and several major newspapers.
   Neither Brady nor President Bush defended Wall in public and,
according to government sources, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray
was pushing for his ouster. Wall, however, declared to a packed
news conference, ``This has been completely at my initiative.''
   Wall said he had offered to leave office last January, but the
administration, which at that time was drafting proposed S&amp;L
bailout legislation, wanted him to serve out his term through June
30, 1991.
   The investigation by the House Banking Committee has also
stirred up trouble for five senators who intervened with regulators
on Lincoln's behalf before Wall took office July 1, 1987.
   ``As I testified under oath, neither political influence nor
Lincoln's Charles Keating affected my decision on Lincoln,'' Wall
said in his resignation letter. ``Nor for that matter have I ever
made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman
and director.''
   The Senate ethics committee is investigating whether the
senators _ Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif; Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, _
violated conflict-of-interest rules in their dealings with Keating,
a Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire who was instrumental in obtaining
thousands of dollars in political contributions to them.
   Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles
and he is the target of a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit
brought by federal regulators.
   None of the members of Congress suggested Wall personally
profited from his Lincoln decisions, but Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn.,
a member of the House Banking Committee, said Monday that Wall
``put politics first and good public policy second'' and used
``excessively bad judgment.''
   Wall said, ``The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to
shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics
to join in the hue and cry raised by the House Banking Committee
chairman for my departure from office.''
   He said Gonzalez ``resorted to corruption of the truth and
abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play and due process
in his effort to remove me from office.''
   Wall testified for 10 hours before Gonzalez's committee in late
November after the committee had already conducted five all-day
sessions to hear from Wall's critics. The regulator attacked what
he called the ``deliberately lopsided presentation'' during the
hearings.

<HEAD>Wall's Departure Unfair, But Not Surprising, Say Some Texans</HEAD>

   M. Danny Wall's resignation Monday as the nation's
chief thrift regulator came as no surprise in Texas, where much of
the industry's problems have been centered.
   Politicians and industry officials said they believed Wall had
become a symbol of the industry's failings and, as such, had to be
replaced as head of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett, a Texas Republican who also serves on the
Banking Committee, said, ``Danny Wall was part of the solution, not
part of the problem.'' But Bartlett added, ``I think (the
resignation) was inevitable. That's not to say it was fair.''
   Although it was Wall's slowness in closing down Lincoln Savings
&amp; Loan Association that was the catalyst for the current wave of
criticism, Bartlett said, ``I think Danny Wall would have been,
even without Lincoln, a controversial person because he was solving
problems.
   ``He left the savings and loan industry stronger than when he
came in,'' Bartlett said.
   Wall was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July
1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new Office
of Thrift Supervision.
   The Texas thrift landscape is much changed from Wall's Southwest
Plan, devised last year to bring new capital into the industry.
   The mergers, designed to take advantage of tax laws before they
expired on Dec. 31, 1988, have been criticized by some who complain
the deals were too expensive.
   Under the plan, steel companies, home builders, investors and
other non-traditional thrift owners bought up groups of insolvent
institutions and packaged them into new entities.
   Four of the five largest Texas thrifts were created under the
Southwest Plan.
   ``In the final accounting, which won't be done for several
years, these Southwest Plan deals might look better than they do
today, based on the cost of resolutions that the RTC (Resolution
Trust Corp.) is experiencing,'' said Bill Ferguson, an industry
consultant in Dallas.
   ``I guess he had just taken about all the flak he could take,''
said H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, whose Bright Banc Savings Association was
seized by regulators earlier this year.
   ``We thought he had fundamentally a reasonable program on his
original Southwest Plan, one that would work out that would be less
cost to the taxpayers than the subsequent plans appear to be from
our standpoint.''
   James L. Pledger, commissioner of the Savings and Loan
Department of Texas, said, ``Danny Wall had the toughest job in
government because of the magnitude of the problems.''
   He praised Wall's attempts to focus public attention on the
healthy portion of the industry.
   ``He has been able to ... maintain a approach that recognizes
that a large portion of the thrift industry is profitable and is
doing well.''

   The Justice Department's antitrust division
Monday recommended approval of a partial merger of the two daily
newspapers in Las Vegas under a joint operating agreement.
   Assistant Attorney General James F. Rill recommended that the
Las Vegas Sun and the Las Vegas Review Journal dailies be allowed
to combine commercial and production facilities but continue to
publish separate editions.
   Rill found that because of circulation and advertising losses,
the Las Vegas Sun was ``in probable danger of financial failure''
and therefore qualified for the antitrust exemption granted by the
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Under the law, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh must make the
final decision whether to allow the proposed joint operating
agreement to proceed.
   If the agreement becomes effective, Las Vegas would be the 21st
city where daily newspapers operate under such an arrangement.
   Rill's report said that financial records show that the morning
Las Vegas Sun has lost $13 million since 1981 as a result of a
substantial decline in circulation and advertising in recent years.
   Circulation of the Sun has shrunk from 58,000 in 1982 to 52,000
last year while advertising linage has dropped from 2 million
column inches in 1984 to 1.3 million in 1988, the division's report
said.
   During the same period, the circulation of the all-day Las Vegas
Review-Journal has increased from 93,000 in 1982 to more than
130,000 last year.
   The Review-Journal's advertising linage has gone up from 2.9
million column inches in 1984 to nearly 3.1 million inches in 1988,
the report said.
   The Review-Journal, which is owned by Donrey Inc., ``holds a
commanding lead in the Las Vegas daily newspaper advertising
market'' over the Sun, which is owned by the family of its founder,
the late Hank Greenspun.

   Economic reforms under way in Czechoslovakia and
Poland should help speed the integration of the two economies into
the international trading system, senior officials of the two
nations said Monday.
   Zdenek Jung, deputy director at the Czechoslovak Federal
Ministry of Foreign Trade, said the process of decentralization and
elimination of state central planning was not a short-term measure
but a ``serious process of reshaping our economy and society.''
   Speaking on the opening day of the annual meeting of the
97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Jung said
existing and planned reforms were designed to create the political,
legal and economic basis for Czechoslovakia's increased involvement
in the world economy.
   Jung called on other countries to help economic liberalization
in Czechoslovakia by easing trade restrictions, citing the example
of European Community limits on certain Czech exports.
   Poland's deputy minister for foreign economic relations, Dr.
Janusz Kaczurba, said Warsaw planned to renegotiate its terms of
membership of GATT as part of the Solidarity-led government's
efforts to ``build a liberal, efficient and open economy.''
   He said Poland wanted to normalize its status in the
international body and adopt the ``normal commitments based on
tariff concessions,'' and other trade liberalizing agreements.
   Poland became a member of GATT in the late 1960s after giving a
promise to increase its imports from other member countries by 7
percent per year. But it did not commit itself to other GATT rules,
such as those on import duties, quotas and subsidies.
   Kaczurba told the meeting that Poland had a new tariff schedule
to conform with GATT rules, and was in the final stages of talks
with the International Monetary Fund on convertibility of foreign
exchange, liberalization of imports and the dismantling of domestic
subsidies.
   The meeting also heard thinly-veiled criticism of the United
States for its threats to use a new section of its trade act to
retaliate against countries accused of unfair restrictions against
U.S. exports if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks.
   EC official Roderick Abbot said the tendency toward bilateralism
and unilateral solutions to trade difficulties were a ``danger'' to
GATT's multilateral system.
   India's ambassador to GATT, Balkrishan Zutshin, appealed against
``this approach of contention and confrontation,'' although he did
not refer to the United States directly.
   India was one of three countries singled out for potential
retaliation under Section 301 of the U.S. trade act because of its
restrictions on foreign investment.
   Texts of speeches to the closed meeting were made available to
reporters.
   In addition to hearing general observations on the world trading
system, the meeting adopted by consensus a report by a GATT
arbitration panel that ruled against Canadian restrictions on
certain dairy imports, a GATT official said on condition of
anonymity.
   Canada's ambassador to GATT, John Weekes, said he would not
block adoption of the report, though Canada would continue
restricting imports of yogurt and ice cream pending new rules on
agriculture drawn up as part of the ambitious Uruguay Round of
Trade liberalizing negotiations. The four-year round is scheduled
to end next December.
   In the Canadian case, raised by the United States, Canada argued
its restrictions were a necessary part of its program to manage the
domestic supply of dairy products.
   The GATT official also said that the United States had agreed to
the establishment of a GATT panel to look into a complaint by
Candada against U.S. duties on Canadian pork exports.
   Members of GATT, which draws up world trade agreements and acts
as a mediator in trade disputes, account for more than four-fifths
of the world's international trade.

<TEXT>
   Florida Power Corp. has been fined
$50,000 for allegedly failing to make sure safety equipment was up
to standards at its Crystal River nuclear plant, the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said Monday.
   The alleged violations involved water pumps and valves that were
of commercial quality and didn't meet federal specifications for
nuclear safety equipment, said NRC spokesman Ken Clark in Atlanta.
   In one case, the impeller of a backup pump used to bring in sea
water for cooling had only five vanes instead of the required
seven. ``For seven weeks, that pump was not capable of fulfilling
its safety function,'' Clark said.
   The St. Petersburg-based utility, which has 30 days to either
pay the fine or appeal it, has corrected all of the violations
listed in the NRC fine, Clark said.
   He said the alleged violations came as the utility was in the
process of trying to upgrade its safety equipment to meet new, more
stringent guidelines imposed by the NRC last March.
   ``We were making an honest effort to meet federal guidelines
within the window of direction we had from the NRC,'' Jacobs said.
   The utility was fined $100,000 by the NRC in September for the
alleged inability of some safety equipment to operate under
post-accident conditions, Jacobs said.

<TEXT>
   The No. 1 gaming device maker in the world
filed a federal lawsuit Monday against a Japanese company, claiming
the foreign firm is using three of the larger company's patents to
make slot machines.
   International Game Technology filed the U.S. District Court
lawsuit against Tokyo-based Sigma Inc. and Sigma Game Inc., a
Sparks, Nev., subsidiary that makes the slot machines.
   ``We believe that most if not all of Sigma's slot machines on
the market infringe on our patents,'' said San Francisco attorney
John Hughes, representing Reno-based IGT.
   Mike Stefanik, director of operations for Sigma Game, said the
company was unaware of the suit, which claims its slot machines are
copies of patented IGT slot machines.
   ``Everybody uses these types of slot machines,'' Stefanik said.
``So their reasoning behind the lawsuit is beyond me.''
   Hughes said IGT wants to force Sigma to change its slot machines
so they don't use patented IGT slot devices.
   IGT also seeks unspecified damages to compensate for any
business the company might have lost because of the alleged patent
infringement, Hughes said.
   ``These devices were patented for a reason _ because they have
unique elements,'' Hughes said.
   IGT, which had revenue of $140 million last year, has a similar
lawsuit pending against a different Japanese company, Universal Co.
Ltd., and its Nevada-based subsidiary company, Universal
Distributing of Nevada.
   In that lawsuit, patent infringement isn't claimed, but IGT
alleges Universal used IGT's trade secrets in manufacturing a video
poker game named ``Player's Edge.''

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Judgment Against DeLorean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Monday that a
British court's award of a $54 million default judgment against
former automaker John Z. DeLorean can be enforced against him.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court's ruling against DeLorean, who tried to
prevent enforcement of the British court's award.
   Last month in London, however, English High Court Judge Peter
Gibson overturned a lower court order that allowed legal documents
in the case to be served on DeLorean at his home in New Jersey,
outside the jurisdiction of the English courts.
   ``It follows that all subsequent orders made against Mr.
DeLorean will fall away,'' Gibson said in his Nov. 24 ruling.
   In October 1987, the High Court of Justice, Chancery Court
division in London awarded the default judgment against DeLorean to
DSQ Property Co. Ltd.
   DSQ Property, formerly DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd. of Belfast,
Northern Ireland, then sued in January 1989 in federal court in New
York City to enforce the British court's judgment against DeLorean,
who had produced cars through DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd.
   The cars were distributed in the United States by DeLorean Motor
Co., which owned 75 percent of DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd.
   The New York federal court transferred the case to U.S. District
Court in Detroit, where Judge Richard Suhrheinrich ruled that the
British court's judgment could be enforced against DeLorean.
DeLorean appealed, but the 6th Circuit appeals court ruled against
him Monday.
   In last month's ruling in England, Gibson said that in DSQ's
application to serve documents on DeLorean outside British
jurisdiction, there had been ``serious non-disclosures'' of
matters, including the existence of proceedings against DeLorean in
the U.S. unrelated to DSQ.
   Mike Morganroth, a lawyer for DeLorean, said Monday night that
the 6th Circuit Court ruling was moot since the British High Court
had set aside the judgment against DeLorean.
   DSQ Property Co. Ltd. was created as the corporate successor to
DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd., which went into financial receivership.
   The British court's judgment and DeLorean's settlement with the
bankruptcy trustee of DeLorean Motor Co., which filed for
bankruptcy in October 1982, resulted from claims involving the
design of the DeLorean automobile.
   The 6th Circuit appellate court rejected DeLorean's arguments
that his settlement with the bankruptcy trustee prevented
recognition or enforcement of the British court's award in the
United States. The court also rejected DeLorean's arguments that he
had not been properly served with documents to inform him of the
British court's award.
   Morganroth said he expects DSQ Property to appeal the British
court's ruling.

<HEAD>Hughes Aircraft Names 37-Year Veteran New President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   D. Kenneth Richardson, a 37-year Hughes
Aircraft Co. veteran, was named president and chief operating
officer of the company Monday and said he was confident Hughes'
diversification away from military work will go well.
   ``We're not abandoning the defense sector. We regard that as our
duty to the nation. But we feel that in the future most of the
growth and opportunity are outside defense,'' said Richardson.
   Richardson replaces Donald H. White, who retired Dec. 1.
   Like all military contractors, Hughes was looking at cuts in
real defense spending even before the recent avalanche of change in
Eastern Europe.
   The satellites and defense electronics company responded by
moving into such areas as telecommunications and simulation and
training systems for commercial airlines. It recently won a $325
million contract to modernize Canada's air-traffic control system,
and is bidding on a $210 million contract to modernize data
processing for the Bureau of Land Management.
   ``I'm an upbeat, positive sort of fellow and I think the
company's future is very good,'' said Richardson.
   Richardson, 58, joined the company in 1952 as a design engineer.
He worked on fighter weapons systems, the Phoenix missile program
and the F-A-18 radar program. He most recently served as executive
vice president for operations after vice presidencies in the radar
systems and missiles groups.
   He becomes president as Hughes, a General Motors Corp. unit,
finishes a six-month streamlining that includes layoffs of 8
percent, or 6,000, of its 75,000 workers, another response to
tighter defense budgets.
   Richardson said the downsizing had met its objective of reducing
the company to the proper size for the next two or three years. He
said it was impossible to tell whether more layoffs would be needed
later given current uncertainties.
   If the government decides to cut the number of military
personnel while upgrading technology, ``We obviously are
well-poised,'' Richardson said.
   ``We're usually, though not always in the forefront in defense
electronics,'' Richardson said. ``And many of the technologies we
developed for defense are easily adaptable to non-government
sectors.''
