<HEAD>Heat Wave Continues in Northern California</HEAD>

   Record temperatures continued to blast Northern California on
Sunday as people sought relief from the fifth day of persistent
heat at crowded beaches, seaside boardwalks and inland waterways.
   ``It's like a summer day. It's not typical of this time of the
year at all,'' said Jamie Bolt at the Bethel Island harbor, about
50 miles east of San Francisco.
   Parched Southern California got a breath of fresh air, however,
when coastal breezes sent temperatures plunging more than 15
degrees in many areas, ending the hottest April week on record.
   The high at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 76 degrees late in
the afternoon, a sharp drop from Saturday's 91 and Thursday's 106,
a record high for an April day.
   The National Weather Service has predicted a cooling trend for
the heat wave that has broken historic levels throughout most of
the region over the weekend.
   But on Sunday, San Francisco logged a high of 91, tying its
all-time streak of four consecutive days in which the thermometer
hit or exceeded 90 degrees. Similar stretches were recorded in
September 1904 and September 1939.
   Sunday's high also broke the city's record, set last year, of 85
for the date.
   Sacramento's high of 95 was also a record for the date and
marked the fourth straight day of 90-or-above temperatures.
   Bakersfield sweated through 97 degrees, four degrees higher than
its year-old record of 93 for April 9. Other cities with record
highs were Fresno, Stockton and San Jose at 95, Santa Rosa at 91
and Alameda at 86.
   A high pressure ridge was predicted by the Weather Service to
move into the Pacific Northwest, bringing cooler weather and
temperatures about 10 degrees lower on Monday.

   A mild earthquake, an aftershock of a
larger quake last Monday, rattled windows but caused no reported
damage in Northern California on Sunday.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at 1:58 p.m.,
registering 3.4 on the Richter scale. The epicenter on the
Calaveras fault, seven miles east of Milpitas, was almost exactly
the same as Monday's quake measuring 4.9, the USGS said. Milpitas
is about 30 miles south of San Francisco.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures the energy released by an
earthquake by tabulating ground motion.
   Each increase of one number, as in a rise from 3.5 to 4.5, means
the ground motion is 10 times greater. A 3.5 earthquake can cause
slight damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   Former New York Rep. Mario Biaggi
arrived in Texas on Sunday to begin his 2{-year prison term for a
bribery conviction.
   Before leaving for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
Biaggi told reporters at Newark International Airport in New Jersey
that he went to church earlier Sunday and visited his wife, Marie
Wassil Biaggi, who is hospitalized with Hodgkin's disease.
   Flanked by family members, the 71-year-old Biaggi smiled often
as he used a cane to walk aboard the Continental Airlines flight
taking him to Fort Worth.
   The former congressman is expected to turn himself in to U.S.
Correctional Facility officials there on Monday and begin serving
his 2{-year sentence.
   ``I have loving grandchildren and loving children,'' Biaggi
said. ``They'll be here when I get back.''
   The 10-term congressman in the Bronx-Westchester district was
convicted on federal bribery charges in September 1987 for
accepting a Florida spa vacation from former Brooklyn Democratic
boss Meade Esposito in exchange for Biaggi's efforts on behalf of a
ship repair company.
   Biaggi was later convicted in Manhattan Federal Court in
connection with the Wedtech scandal and sentenced to eight years.
That conviction is under appeal.
   Biaggi has maintained he accepted the Florida vacation as a
friend of Esposito.
   ``I find myself going to a federal facility today because a
friend of some 35 years was generous to me,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 17-year-old boy has been convicted of
killing another teen-ager and injuring six others by driving into a
crowd of partying classmates.
   Eric Norstrom sank into his chair, shaking and stunned when he
was found guilty Friday of vehicular homicide, reckless driving and
two counts of culpable negligence to end the weeklong trial.
   ``Nobody won,'' said Raymond Hamby, whose son Charles, 19,
remains in a traumatic brain injury center in Central Florida as a
result of the accident.
   Norstrom was speeding to the party in Boynton Beach on March 24,
1988, when he lost control of his car, skidded out of control and
slammed into the crowd, killing Amber Hunter, 16.
   Defense attorney Michael Salnick maintained the crash was an
accident, not a crime. It was ``a horrible thing for everybody,''
he said. ``Eric is very, very sorry for what happened.''
   But Salnick said sending the teen-ager to prison because of the
accident would mean ``another life being wasted as a result of this
whole, horrible tragedy.''
   Maria Feldman, 16, a former cheerleader whose left thigh and
cheekbone were fractured in the accident, said she was satisfied
with the verdicts.
   ``It's not like I got some great satisfaction because he's going
to be in prison,'' Feldman said. ``I feel bad, but I didn't do
anything wrong.''
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Marvin Mounts agreed to postpone
sentencing until after Norstrom graduates June 7. State sentencing
guidelines recommend three to seven years in prison for the
convictions.

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners on Saturday fired shells
into Lebanon's Christian enclave in defiance of a cease-fire called
by the Arab League, but no casualties were reported.
   A police spokesman said Syrian artillery emplacements fired five
howitzer shells into different areas of the 310-square-mile
enclave. The 130-millimeter shells exploded in unpopulated areas,
said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules.
   He said gunners of Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 Christian troops
did not respond to the Syrian fire.
   ``It's what we call artillery harassment. It's a message that
says there is no settlement yet and there is no total war,'' the
spokesman said.
   The truce was called Wednesday by Kuwait's foreign minister,
Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, who heads an Arab League committee
on Lebanon.
   Despite the relative calm that had prevailed since early Friday,
the divided capital seemed a ghost city.
   Most civilians stayed indoors out of fear of renewed shelling
duels.
   The current fighting erupted March 8 after Aoun ordered a
blockade of militia-run ports, which deprive the government of an
estimated $100 million annually in lost taxes.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
militia responded by shelling the Christian enclave, and Syrian
troops later joined Jumblatt in the confrontation.
   The fighting has left 177 people dead and 591 wounded.
   Jumblatt told a news conference in Damascus, the Syrian capital,
that there was no possibility of a political dialogue with Aoun to
settle Lebanon's problems.
   ``What is the use of a dialogue with these people who
perpetrated the catastrophe? There will be no dialogue with Aoun
and his clique,'' Jumblatt said.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of siding
with the Moslems in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war and failing to
respect their 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. Syria
has 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   Jumblatt repeated Syrian denials of involvement in the fighting
and also accused Aoun of seeking to ``impose his solution with
massive imports of material and political support from Iraq.''
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival wings of the Baath socialist
party, have been at odds for a decade. Syria supported Persian Iran
against Arab Iraq in the eight-year gulf war, suspended by a United
Nations cease-fire on Aug. 20.
   The Syrian news agency reported that Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Al-Sharaa discussed the situation in Lebanon with Soviet
foreign ministry representative, Jinadi Trasov, who is visiting
Damascus.
   Syria keeps close relations with the Soviet Union, its major
arms supplier.
   A commentary on Damascus radio reiterated the Syrian position of
seeking ``to create an ambiance that will secure stability and
tranquillity in Lebanon for the Lebanese people.''

   A college student who set himself
afire in his classroom in an anti-American protest died Saturday at
a hospital, officials reported.
   Nam Tae-hyun, 24, a senior at Seoul Normal College, doused
gasoline over his body and set it ablaze Friday night.
   Friends said they heard Nam shouting ``Yankee go home and
national unification!'' as they rushed into the room.
   Self-immolation is frequently used by South Korean dissidents to
dramatize their anger. About a dozen people have committed suicide
by setting themseves afire since 1980.
   Anti-government students say the 42,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in South Korea block unification of the country with
communist North Korea.

   Thousands of demonstrators marched through downtown
Saturday to protest a new base for U.S. F-16 fighter bombers in
southern Italy.
   The protesters also demanded that all NATO bases in Europe be
closed.
   At least 10,000 people took part in the march, organizers said.
Police put the number at closer to 4,000.
   Protesters carried a large banner that said ``No to NATO _ No to
the F-16s.''
   The sign referred to the government's decision last year to host
a squadron of the fighter bombers, which are being moved from their
base in Spain to Calabria, Italy's far southern province.

   A despondent man who said he had AIDS took up to
four people hostage at a hospital Saturday and then shot himself to
death. A short time later, one policeman accidentally shot another
while looking for the gunman.
   The wounded officer, identified as Jose Rodriguez, 32, was in
satisfactory condition after being hit in the shoulder by a bullet
fired by an officer who encountered him in a stairwell at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
   Police converged on the hospital about 1 a.m. after 39-year-old
Richard Carr of Manhattan entered the emergency room and demanded
to be readmitted, First Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Condon
said.
   Carr had discharged himself from the hospital on Friday against
the advice of doctors, who would not say why he had been in the
hospital, Condon said.
   The New York Daily News, in its Sunday editions, quoted a
witness who said she watched the beginning of the siege.
   Willie May Scott, a home health attendant, said she saw Carr
hand a note to a hospital guard after fidgeting for about 45
minutes in a waiting room with his girlfriend.
   ``Then he went into his pocket like this, real nice and easy,
took out the gun and put it to the man's head,'' Scott said. ``He
said, `I got AIDS. I don't have anything to lose. I'm going to die
anyway.' His girlfriend started screaming, `No! Don't do this!'''
   Carr had been a patient in the hospital for about two weeks,
said Anne Trachtenberg, a hospital spokeswoman. She wouldn't
identify his illness.
   When Carr returned early Saturday to the emergency room, he
``wanted to be readmitted and wanted the room he had originally,''
Condon said.
   With a .38-caliber revolver in hand, Carr took two security
guards, an X-ray technician and his girlfriend as hostages,
according to the commissioner.
   Trachtenberg, however, said Carr took only one security guard
hostage. The other three, she said, followed the pair to convince
the gunman ``to put down the gun and release the hostage.''
   Carr took the four people to a second-floor room in a
non-patient area, firing a shot into the door from the outside. He
then left the second floor and went down a stairway to the first
floor, Condon said.
   ``He opened a door, saw police, and shot himself,'' Condon said.
``Carr fired three shots. He shot himself in the chest twice and
then shot himself in the head.''
   Carr was declared dead at 2:46 a.m., Condon said.
   At some point apparently after Carr shot himself, Rodriguez was
shot in the shoulder by Officer Peter Heiberger, 26, according to
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   ``The police officer made a mistake,'' Condon said of Heiberger.
He said the officer may have been confused by Rodriguez' dark
leather jacket, which is part of the police uniform but could have
made him look like a civilian.

<TEXT>
   A drive-by barrage of 40 gunshots left two
people dead and nine injured Saturday in a neighborhood known for
gang activity, drug-dealing and violence.
   The victims, ranging in age from 14 to 20, had no known gang
affiliations, said Police Chief Frank Jordan during a news
conference at the Hall of Justice, where he was flanked by Mayor
Art Agnos.
   Both men appealed for public support in maintaining peace in the
Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood and asked for information that
could help investigators looking for as many as four young male
suspects.
   Jordan identified the dead as 20-year-old Roshawn Johnson, who
was shot dead on the street, and 18-year-old Charles Hughes, who
died after being taken to Mission Emergency Hospital.
   Four victims were treated and released, but five remained in the
hospital late Saturday, including one man in serious but stable
condition, according to a nursing supervisor. Four others were in
satisfactory condition.
   The gunfire erupted about 12:45 a.m. Saturday. A gathering
involving about 200 people and sponsored by local church groups had
broken up about a mile away a short time earlier, police said.
   Three or four male youths had parked their car and were talking
to six girls when a four males drove by firing assorted weapons,
striking people, vehicles and buildings, said homicide inspector
Napoleon Hendrix.
   Authorities said the assailants appeared to have chosen their
male victims at random, and they believed the girls got caught in
the crossfire.
   ``They just said `Sunnydale' and they just opened up firing,''
said a young man who suffered a shotgun pellet wound to his right
wrist and told the San Francisco Examiner he was a member of the
Oakdale Mob gang.
   ``I told everybody to duck. I could see the bullets hitting all
around me. They be shooting girls and everything,'' he said.
   On March 23, police guarded over the funeral of Sunnydale gang
member Peter Lee, 19, fearing an outbreak of violence between
Sunnydale members and rivals.
   Police blame gangs for one homicide and 11 drive-by shootings so
far this year. Officials say gangs are fighting over the city's
lucrative cocaine trade. Jordan estimated there are 40 gangs in San
Francisco, with about 800 to 1,000 members.

   A 16-year-old boy was sentenced to six
years in state prison for his role in a school cafeteria shooting
that killed an assistant principal.
   Jason McCoy embraced his mother Toni McCoy after his sentencing
Friday in the shootings at Pinellas Park High School. He had
pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and three counts of burglary
with a deadly weapon.
   ``Jason's a heck of a lot more prepared for it than I am,'' Mrs.
McCoy said. ``He just wants to get in, get it done and get out.''
   As part of a plea bargain, Circuit Judge Claire Luten ordered
McCoy placed in a youthful offender program for his role in the
Feb. 11, 1988, shooting that killed assistant principal Richard
Allen and injured two other school employees.
   With good behavior, McCoy could be released from prison in less
than two years.
   Co-defendant Jason Harless was sentenced last month to 17 years
in prison, followed by 20 years of probation.
   On the day of the shooting, McCoy ran away from home with
Harless, took two .38-caliber handguns from a neighbor's house and
went to say goodbye to friends at school.
   After learning the youths had guns, Allen and assistant
principal Nancy Blackwelder tackled McCoy. Student teacher Joseph
Bloznalis grabbed Harless, but he broke away after shooting
Bloznalis in the leg. Harless then shot Allen and Mrs. Blackwelder.
   Pinellas Park police tackled Harless outside the school, but
McCoy ran back to the house where the two had stolen the guns and
grabbed another one. He broke into his girlfriend's house and
surrendered after an hourlong police standoff.

   Eight bombs believed set by Basque
separatists exploded early Saturday along a railroad line in the
Navarre region, damaging rails and a power station but causing no
injuries, officials reported.
   Two hours before the pre-dawn blasts a man telephoned a local
travelers aid office and said the Basque separatist organization
ETA had placed several bombs on the rail line, according to the
regional governor's office said.
   It said six bombs exploded beside railroad power line posts at
Ciordia and two others damaged a transformer substation near Zuasti.
   Police demolition experts defused three other bombs at the
sites, the office said.
   The bombings were the first blamed on the ETA since the group
announced April 4 it would renew its 21-year-old campaign of
attacks to gain independence for the three-province Basque region
in northern Spain.
   Last week the ETA claimed the government of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez had reneged on accords reached in peace talks that
began in January in Algeria.
   The government denied the allegation and said it was willing to
continue the talks if the ETA ruled out violence. ETA is an acronym
in the Basque language for homeland and liberty.

<TEXT>
   South Korea, in a move to ease
mounting U.S. pressure, announced a three-year plan Saturday to
open its market to 243 foreign agricultural and fishery products by
1991.
   Agriculture-Fishery Minister Kim Sik said South Korea will open
its market to 82 items this year, 76 more in 1990 and 85 more in
1991.
   Kim said the government will earmark $755 million to subsidize
or compensate farmers for any financial losses that may result from
foreign imports.
   ``The decision is final and we will not bow to any further U.S.
pressure to expand the plan,'' he said. ``Any further market
opening after 1991 will be decided at that time.''
   The 243 items covered under the plan include 62 of the 119
products Washington had said should be liberalized.
   Major items affected under the three-year plan include wheat,
soybean oil, alfafa, grapes, canned peaches, duck meat, fresh and
frozen salmon and peas.
   Tropical fruits _ including bananas, pineapples and kiwi fruits
_ will be free for import.
   The United States has threatened to retaliate unless South Korea
expands its restricted agricultural market wider to foreign
imports. Washington says America suffered an $8.6 billion trade
deficit with South Korea last year.
   Imports of 643 items of all 1,785 agricultural and fisheries
products classified under an internationally recognized agreement
are currently restricted by South Korea.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The human rights monitor Africa Watch has
accused the Angolan government and U.S. backed rebels of abuses
ranging from indiscriminate use of land mines to restricting the
movement of civilians.
   In a report for release Sunday, ``Angola: Violations of the Laws
of War by Both Sides,'' Africa Watch, which is part of Human Rights
Watch, said civilians in the African country have borne the brunt
of the 14-year-old war between the government and UNITA, the
Portuguese acronym by which the South Africa-supported rebels are
known.
   ``Reportedly, Angola has the highest figures in the world for
civilian casualties of land mines ... estimates range from 20,000
to 50,000,'' Human Rights Watch staff member Jemera Rone wrote in
the 153-page report.
   The report accused both UNITA and the People's Republic of
Angola of indiscriminantly placing land mines in areas frequented
by civilians.
   Rone interviewed more than 80 Angolan refugees in Zaire and
Zambia at the end of 1988 to prepare the report. Africa Watch said
requests for visas to conduct research in Angola were ignored by
the Angolan government.
   The Angolan government was accused of forcibly displacing
thousands of civilians in a bid to deny support to UNITA, while
UNITA was accused of forcing civilians to fight or work on farms.
UNITA also has restricted the movements of civilians in areas under
its control, confiscating their food and forcing them into labor,
the report said.
   The government, according to the report, has attacked and killed
civilians in areas controlled by UNITA, and civilians in
government-controlled areas have been UNITA targets.
   Under a United Nations accord signed in December, Cuba was to
withdraw 50,000 troops sent to help the Angolan government battle
UNITA.
   South Africa agreed to end military aid to the Angolan rebels
and grant independence to Namibia, a southern African territory
neighboring Angola that South Africa had controlled since the
League of Nations gave it a mandate after World War I.
   In 1945, the United Nations told South Africa to relinquish
Namibia, but South Africa refused.
   Africa Watch said the U.N. accord left the United States as
UNITA's principal supporter.
   In a statement, Africa Watch said the United States ``has
consistently sought to minimize violations by UNITA.''

   An explosion apparently caused by a
natural gas leak demolished a 40-foot section of a motel early
Sunday morning, injuring 31 people, authorities said. One man was
missing.
   ``The center of the building is gone, and then there's fire
damage both ways,'' said Charlie Allen, acting battalion chief for
the Billings Fire Department.
   The explosion occurred shortly after 1 a.m. at the three-story
Super 8 Lodge in this south-central Montana city of 75,000.
Authorities said about 60 people were staying in the motel and it
was about half full.
   Dick Blee, the acting Billings fire chief, said Montana-Dakota
Utilities received a telephone call, presumably from an employee of
the motel, who said there was a strong smell of natural gas. The
explosion followed about four minutes later, he said.
   One man, described as a truck driver who was staying at the
motel, was missing. Spokeswomen for the city's two major hospitals
said 31 people had been treated for injuries and two were admitted.
   Heavy machinery was being moved to the site near Interstate 90
to remove the larger pieces of debris, Allen said.
   Firefighters had the blaze under control by 4 a.m., Allen said,
and the area around the motel remained blocked off to the public.
   Blee said a truck belonging to the missing man was in the motel
parking lot. Earlier, authorities had feared that more people were
missing; Blee said there were problems accounting for some motel
occupants because they left after the explosion.
   The explosion appeared to be in a laundry in the center of the
motel, Blee said, an area with natural-gas lines. Individual rooms
in the motel have electric heat.

   A Roman Catholic priest has come up with
his own 11th Commandment: ``Thou shalt not even think of parking
here.''
   The gospel according to the Rev. Matthew McInerney is proclaimed
on a notice outside his church in Crawley, 27 miles south of London.
   The sign is part of his battle with motorists who park in front
of the church and block hearses.
   ``People who don't have permits should not park here, but they
still do it,'' McInerney said Sunday. ``Like the other 10
commandments, it is ignored.''

   A woman believed to be Japan's oldest person, Mitsu
Fujisawa, marked her 113th birthday Sunday in a hospital where she
has been under treatment since February, her daughter said.
   Her 71-year-old daughter, Midori Sato, said Mrs. Fujisawa is
``all right'' except for the neuralgia she is being treated for.
Neuralgia is severe pain associated with a nerve.
   She can walk unaided but has trouble hearing, her daughter said.
   Officials of Suwa Kyoritsu Hospital in Nagano, in north central
Japan, said nurses greeted Mrs. Fujisawa on her birthday, but there
was no special celebration.
   Such claims of longevity are often subject to dispute. The 1989
Guinness Book of World Records listed 112-year-old Birdie May Vogt
of Miami, Fla., as the oldest living person for whom there is
adequate authentication.
   Guinness says the greatest authenticated age any human ever
attained was 120 years in the case of Shigechiyo Izumi of Asan,
Japan. He died Feb. 21, 1986, after developing pneumonia.

   Radical students battled riot police
with rocks and firebombs Sunday after police blocked protesters
trying to gain access to a university campus for an anti-government
rally.
   Several hundred students yelling ``Overthrow President Roh
Tae-woo!'' clashed with riot police outside the main gate of
Hanyang University in eastern Seoul.
   About 1,000 riot police ringed Hanyang for about four hours,
guarding roads around the school. All students were stopped for
identification and only those with Hanyang ID cards were allowed to
enter.
   Angry students tore down some of the brick wall around the
campus and dug up a cement roadway, using the debris to hurl at
police. Police retaliated with barrages of tear gas, causing shops
in the area to close and stopping traffic on the main street in
front of the campus.
   The rally was called to protest police action in putting down
labor unrest and the government's vow to arrest a leading
dissident, the Rev. Moon Il-kwan, when he returns to Seoul from
North Korea on Thursday.
   Moon made the unauthorized trip to talk with communist leaders
there about unification of the Korean peninsula, divided since 1945.
   The students also protested the action in which 14,000 riot
police stormed the Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in the port
city of Ulsan to end a three-month strike.
   Thousands of police remained in Ulsan, 150 miles southeast of
Seoul, to guard against further violence following the police
crackdown. Radical students and dissidents have been blocked from
getting near the shipyard, news reports said.

<HEAD>To Make Fido's Day, Feed Him Yogurt or Steamed Broccoli</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAKOMA PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take away Fido's bowl of gravy-laden
goodies and treat him instead to a dollop of yogurt or some steamed
broccoli. And if Tabby is bothered by fleas, try using a collar
soaked in eucalyptus oil or sprinkling garlic on her supper.
   This prescription for happy, healthy pets is written by Dr.
Monique Maniet, an auburn-haired, Belgian-born veterinarian who
practices holistic medicine for ailing dogs and cats.
   She uses vaccines and antibiotics, if necessary, but prefers
natural foods, soothing herbs, Chinese acupuncture, chiropractic
massages and plenty of tender, loving care to help her furry
patients heal themselves.
   Dr. Maniet says she gets ``astonishing results'' from
acupuncture, especially among dogs plagued by arthritis or itching
skin. The needles, however, are likely to provoke a yowling,
fur-flying complaint from feline pets.
   If Fido is suffering from swollen joints, she might inject some
honeybee venom. If he's uptight about missing his usual breakfast
of red meat, she might calm him with a herbal tranquilizer of black
cohosh and passion flowers.
   ``Research has shown that our pets can benefit from the same
holistic care that we are learning to give to ourselves,'' Dr.
Maniet says, speaking in a soft French accent.
   ``Most of us have just begun to examine the way we live,
assessing our food choices, sleeping habits, exercise routines and
emotional support,'' she said. ``Animals have many of the same
needs.''
   Dr. Maniet came to the United States in 1977 with her new
American husband, a fellow veterinary student in Brussels. With two
other woman doctors, she opened the Takoma Park Animal Clinic last
November in this quiet residential neighborhood just north of
Washington.
   Although a counter rack contains the ``Rodeo Drive Fragrance
Collection'' of spray colognes for dogs (available in Chanel,
Giorgio and Opium scents), the bulletin board's recommended reading
list runs more to Dr. Maniet's tastes. Titles include ``Fleas:
Getting the Jump on Them Naturally'' and ``Spring Cleaning From
Head to Toe _ Herbs and Fasting Work Wonders.''
   Dr. Maniet is worried that pets, like their owners, are being
poisoned by the drugs they take and the food they eat.
   She says commercial pet foods sold in supermarkets are loaded
with harmful preservatives, artificial flavors and coloring, toxic
chemicals and processed meat from diseased animals unfit for human
consumption.
   She says pet food is contaminated by traces of urine, fecal
matter, hair and bits of beaks and claws, and contains hazardous
amounts of sugar and salt to make it palatable.
   ``Our poor animals are fed this diet all the time,'' she said.
``Taking all that sugar and salt is like eating nothing but fast
food hamburgers all the time. That's why we have hyperactive kids
and schizophrenic people.''
   Spokesmen for the $5.3 billion-a-year pet food industry and the
American Meat Institute said animal food products are safe,
nutritious and carefully regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   For dogs, Dr. Maniet recommends a homemade diet of protein-rich
fresh meat, chicken, egg and cottage cheese, mixed with rice,
carrots and green beans boiled until they're mushy. Sprinkle with
enzymes and vitamin supplements, and serve twice a day.
   For more finicky cats, she says, boost the protein, throw in
some tuna for taste and stir the whole mess in a blender.
   Unexpected foods make great treats for pets, Dr. Maniet says.
Try a scoop of yogurt _ ``it has the good bacteria for digestion''
_ or a morsel of steamed broccoli, finely sliced raw potato or
shredded carrot.
   ``Dogs like carrots and beans so much they won't want to go back
to their canned food,'' she said.

<HEAD>Waterford Chairman Resigns Over Reported Accounting Errors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the financially troubled
Waterford Glass Group PLC resigned Sunday after an audit showed
that accounting errors were made at the famed crystal and glass
manufacturer.
   Paddy Hayes, chairman and chief executive of the company that
owns Waterford Crystal in Ireland and Wedgewood China in Britain,
issued a statement in Dublin in which he disclosed that
``previously unreported figures'' had been found by accountants
Peat Marwick McLintock. He said he therefore resigned, ``in keeping
with well-established business tradition.''
   Hayes' resignation was announced hours after Dublin's Sunday
Tribune reported that the independent accountants' report will show
that inventories at three Waterford plants were overvalued by up to
$33 million.
   In his brief statement, Hayes did not elaborate on what he
described as accounting errors.
   Waterford hired Peat Marwick McLintock in January to conduct an
independent review of the group's financial performance and,
specifically, the valuation of its crystal inventory.
   In recent years, Waterford, one of Ireland's best known
manufacturers and one of the country's largest employers, has
suffered huge losses, mainly due to the weakening U.S. dollar.
One-third of the 3,000 employees in Waterford's crystal division
have lost their jobs.
   Half of Waterford's crystal is exported directly to the United
States, and another 35 percent is bought by Americans traveling
abroad.
   Hayes, former chief executive of Ford in Ireland, started
working for Waterford in 1985.

<HEAD>Official Chinese Commentary Doubts Vietnam's Withdrawal Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Vietnam-Look Back, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's official news agency on Sunday expressed
doubts Vietnam will pull all its troops out of Cambodia by the end
of September as promised, saying Hanoi has ``a notorious record of
insincerity.''
   The Xinhua News Agency in its commentary said Vietnam is trying
to conceal a large number of troops in Cambodia by moving them into
the ranks of the Hanoi-backed Hun Sen faction or turning them into
armed immigrants.
   Xinhua said there was ``nothing new'' in Vietnam's statement
last week that it will leave Cambodia by September, and it said
seven partial pullouts announced between 1982 and 1988 ``were a
sham.''
   ``Hanoi has had a notorious record of insincerity in terms of
the troop withdrawal,'' it said.
   Previously, Vietnam had said it would only withdraw all its
troops by September if a political settlement of the Cambodian
conflict had been reached.
   China supports the anti-Vietnamese resistance in Cambodia and
has long demanded that Soviet-backed Vietnam end its 10-year
military presence in Cambodia. Hanoi has withdrawn about half its
troops and says 50,000 remain. Western analysts put the number at
70,000.
   ``If it is really implementing its promise of a total troop
pullout, Vietnam should withdraw not only all of its troops of
aggression, who wear uniforms and carry weapons, but also those
concealing their identity among the Phnom Penh puppet troops or as
immigrants,'' the news agency said.
   The commentary said Vietnam's refusal to accept U.N. monitoring
``shows that Hanoi is not willing to receive real and effectual
international supervision.''
   In what appeared to be new optimism in peace talks, Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk on Sunday extended his
plans for a meeting next month with Cambodia's prime minister,
saying it will take ``at least two days.''
   Both sides initially spoke only of meeting May 2 in Jakarta,
Indonesia. But in a message to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
in Bangkok, Thailand, Sihanouk said, ``My unofficial talks with Mr.
Hun Sen about Cambodia will take at least two days. I will return
to Bangkok (from Jakarta) on May 4 or 5.''
   Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted
the communist Khmer Rouge.
   In an interview later Sunday with the British Broadcasting
Corp., Sihanouk said he believed a ``good settlement'' could be
reached by August if his proposal for an international conference
on Cambodia were carried out in early summer.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of eight young women have
turned up in recent months along wooded highways near this port
city. And David Amaral's sister is missing.
   Family members and investigators fear that she and another
missing woman are the ninth and 10th victims of an apparent serial
killer.
   ``She had her problems, but she wouldn't just walk off,'' Amaral
said of his 25-year-old sister, Sandra Botelho. ``I'm sure she's
dead. And every time they find a body, it starts all over again.''
   The most recent body was found March 31 and identified last week
as that of Mary Rose Santos, 26.
   Botelho, the mother of two young children, has been missing
since August. Like the eight women whose remains have been found
within a few miles of each other since the summer, she was a drug
user who spent time in the city's less savory quarters.
   The district attorney says evidence indicates the slayings are
the work of the same person or persons, but he has declined to
reveal details of the investigation.
   Until recently the investigation seemed at a standstill, but an
anonymous tipster alerted officials to the killer's eighth victim.
Last week, after Ms. Santos' body was found, the tipster responded
to a plea to contact police again, but officers wouldn't say what
information he or she provided.
   New Bedford police heard from a string of families with missing
wives or daughters from May to September 1988, and the first body
was found in July. But it was not until the first victim was
identified in December as a New Bedford woman that the
investigation really kicked into gear.
   Amaral recalled that when his sister disappeared last summer,
police told him ``she was over 21 and there was nothing they could
do.''
   Police defended the delay in beginning the investigation in
earnest.
   ``We're a police department for everyone, wherever you stand on
the social level,'' Capt. Carl Moniz said. ``But when you're
talking about drug addicts or prostitutes, there's always the
possibility that they've just wandered off.''
   State Trooper Jose Gonsalves said his special investigation
unit, which is attached to the district attorney's office, was not
initially assigned to the case because of the women's backgrounds
and because there was little concrete evidence to go on.
   ``The topic of missing `girls' would come up. In the back of our
minds we were very aware that these people were gone,'' he said.
``The thought was that maybe something had happened to them, but we
can't commit four people to doing a lot of work when they may have
just left for California or Florida.''
   Since December, though, investigators have worked overtime,
painstakingly matching the list of missing women with the eight
bodies and then finding the common denominators in their lives.
   The victims, many of whom knew each other, all were drug users.
Some used prostitution to support their habit. Others had spent
time in jail on various charges. They were part of the transient
population that drifts in and out of the city's gritty Weld Square
section.
   They were also mothers, sisters, daughters. Grieving relatives
don't deny the victims were troubled, but they also remember how
Mary Rose Santos liked to turn leftovers into feasts for her
family. How Nancy Paiva looked forward to hiding her children's
gifts at Christmastime. And how Dawn Mendes, a high school dropout,
was honored in 1987 for volunteer work at her son's school.
   But they find that because of the lives the victims led, most
people in this working-class city of 98,000 are following the case
with interest but not the alarm the relatives feel.
   ``It doesn't mean the crime is less bad,'' said Mayor John
Bullard. ``But because these women's lives share a pattern that the
great majority doesn't fall into, people don't feel personally
threatened.''
   State troopers and dogs are still searching for bodies, tramping
over pine needles and weaving among white cedars.
   ``At first we put up posters up all around town,'' said Arnold
Harrison, Ms. Santos' father. ``She had three children to bring up
and we just couldn't believe she wouldn't be coming home. The
wishing is over now.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Jose Figueres, whom
many consider the father of Costa Rican democracy, remained
hospitalized in serious condition on Sunday, his doctor said.
   ``Although he has improved slightly, he is still not out of
danger and we are treating a kidney infection,'' said Dr. Jaime
Gutierrez.
   Gutierrez said Figueres, 83, was admitted Friday night to San
Juan de Dios Hospital after suffering severe chest pains and kidney
problems.
   The doctor said Saturday that Figueres was too old to be fitted
with a pacemaker and that he was in danger of dying. The Rev.
Alberto Casals, a Roman Catholic priest, told reporters he had
delivered last rites to Figueres.
   Five of Figueres' six children and his two former wives were at
the hospital along with some government officials, hospital sources
reported.
   An adviser to President Oscar Arias said the president may cut
short a trip to Canada if Figueres' condition does not improve.
   Arias recently said Figueres is ``like my second father and has
been my political guide.'' Both belong to the governing National
Liberation Party, which Figueres founded in 1953.
   In 1948, after elections many considered fraudulent, Figueres
led a band of rebels in a brief but bloody revolution that
overthrew President Fernando Calderon Guardia who had allied
himself with the Communist Party.
   Figueres took over as president of a provisional junta for a
year, banning the communists and overseeing the writing of a new
constitution that provided increased social services.
   He also abolished the armed forces, making Costa Rica the only
nation in Latin America _ and one of the few in the world _ without
a military. Since then, Costa Rica has been Central America's most
enduring democracy.
   Figueres served a second presidential term from 1953 to 1958 and
a third from 1970 to 1974.

<TEXT>
   A judge who said he lightened the sentence
of a murderer because his two homosexual victims were ``asking for
trouble'' is claiming that demands for his dismissal are
politically motivated.
   The state Supreme Court and the Commission on Judicial Conduct
have launched inquiries into the behavior of district Judge Jack
Hampton, who made the comment in an interview with the Dallas Times
Herald in December that touched off widespread criticism.
   In documents filed Friday with the Supreme Court, Hampton said a
petition from 17 lawyers demanding his dismissal ``is politically
motivated without basis or foundation.''
   Hampton said in the interview that one reason he sentenced the
man convicted of killing the two men to 30 years instead of life in
prison was that the victims were ``queers cruising the streets for
teen-age boys'' who were ``asking for trouble.''
   Court records show the defendant's testimony was the only
evidence that the two men were soliciting sex.
   Gay and civil rights groups have organized demonstrations, some
urging the removal of the judge.
   Hampton, a Republican who has been on the bench for almost eight
years, denied that his behavior during or after the trial could be
construed as biased and said the Democrats were out to get him.
   The attacks are ``the reflection of a county and a courthouse
charged with political activity in which one political party
undertakes to bash the other political party,'' he said.

   The Sunday Telegraph reported that Libya is
planning terrorist attacks on U.S. airlines and other American
targets to mark the third anniversary of the April 15 bombing of
Libya.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA, in a dispatch monitored in
Rome, denied the report.
   The London weekly attributed its story out of Washington to an
unidentified senior intelligence official, who said the Libyan
threats were being taken ``very seriously'' as they were based on
``hard evidence, not vague suspicions.''
   It said the official would not discuss details or the source of
the information.
   The Telegraph quoted a spokesman of the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration as saying it had not issued any special warning to
U.S. airlines.
   The newspaper said U.S. government posts and military bases
overseas had been warned to take special security precautions this
month.
   In a commentary by its international affairs editor, who was not
named, JANA said, ``We reaffirm, once again, that these claims are
lies and groundless and we renew our bewilderment at this strange
determination by the mass media in continuing the promotion of
these lies.''
   U.S. F-111 aircraft operating from Britain bombed Libya on April
15, 1986, in retaliation for terrorist attacks allegedly plotted by
Libya that killed five Americans.

<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest city votes for a
mayor on Tuesday, and despite increased crime, pollution and
traffic, Tom Bradley appears headed toward an unprecedented fifth
term.
   The city's first black mayor, a former policeman and son of a
sharecropper, is 71, yet energetic as ever. During his 16 years in
office, proud residents says the city has grown into a cultural
center, a world-class Pacific Rim metropolis and an ethnically rich
mecca for opportunity-seeking immigrants.
   But with the city's explosive growth has come traffic and
building congestion, pollution, sewage problems, rampant drug
trafficking and uncontrollable street gangs who committed more than
250 murders in the city last year.
   As Los Angeles continues to swell beyond its 3 million citizens
who speak more than 70 languages, the main question in Tuesday's
mayoral election is who will lead it into the 1990s and 21st
century.
   Bradley says he can and he will.
   ``I've done an excellent job over the last 16 years. We have
many programs that are under way or planned, and I want to follow
through on them,'' he said Thursday.
   ``The years ahead,'' Bradley continued, ``can be and should be
and must be the years of air and water made clean, of neighborhoods
made safer, of growth and progress that weighs human as well as
material values.''
   The mayor's opponents disagree. They include a city councilman,
former television commentator, an aerospace worker, and a woman who
dances around the Civic Center in a green dress.
   Despite the opposition, though, few expect that Bradley will
even need a runoff in order to win another four-year term. A runoff
would be scheduled for June 6 only if no one gets more than 50
percent of the vote Tuesday.
   Bradley's main challenger is a freshman city councilman, Nate
Holden, 59, who only recently gained widespread attention by buying
back Uzis and AK-47 rifles from citizens and destroying them.
   Holden says Bradley has been in office too long and predicts
that residents ``are not going to vote for him out of habit
anymore.''
   In the final weeks of campaigning, Holden and other blacks have
also accused Bradley of ignoring his roots and the impoverished
south side in favor of courting big business and foreign trade.
   The stress on foreign trade also bothers candidate Baxter Ward,
a former TV news commentator and former county supervisor, who says
Bradley spend so much time away from the city he ``thinks City Hall
is in Tokyo, Japan.''
   In perhaps the most damaging personal issue, Bradley is under
investigation by the city attorney's office for performing
consulting work with two banks that do business with the city.
Bradley has returned the $18,000 in fees he was paid and called the
charges politically motivated.
   Bradley has been dubbed the ``Teflon mayor,'' with polls
indicating residents do not blame him for the city's woes.
   In a recent Los Angeles Times poll, 65 percent surveyed said
their quality of life worsened during the Bradley years to the
point that half have recently considered moving.
   However, in another Times poll, 78 percent of Hispanics, 70
percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable
impression of the Democratic mayor.
   ``They are not holding him accountable for it. The drugs and the
gangs are causing it. But they don't think Tom Bradley is causing
it. He's a lucky politician,'' said Joe Cerrell, a political
consultant who has known Bradley since he was a police lieutenant
in the 1950s.
   Arnold Steinberg, a pollster who assessed the race for a liberal
councilman who decided not to challenge Bradley, said they
concluded Bradley's popularity was insurmountable.
   ``Tom Bradley is too likable,'' Cerrell agreed. ``He's a nice
guy. It shows he has a rare quality. He doesn't scare people.''
   The other mayoral hopefuls are socialist Joel Britton, an oil
refinery worker; singer-dancer Eileen Anderson; teachers Raul Reyes
and Maria Elizabeth Munoz; consultant Khushro Ghandhi; aerospace
worker Stewart Alexander; politician Leonard Earl Miropol; and
political scientist Gary Passi.
   The city's 1.4 million voters also will choose eight of the city
council's 15 seats, a city attorney, a controller and school board
members.

<HEAD>Shamir Doubts Negotiations Can Take Place While Uprising Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Sunday he cannot imagine holding elections among Palestinians
living on the West Bank and Gaza Strip as long as the Palestinian
uprising continues there.
   While Shamir renewed his offer to allow Palestinians to elect
representatives who would negotiate self-rule in the territories
under continued Israeli authority, he also said it would be at
least three years before talks could commence on the future of the
territories taken by Israeli in the Six-Day War of 1967.
   And during an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' the 73-year-old Shamir voiced regret about the killings
of Palestinians, saying Israel will not consider attempting to
quash the uprising _ the intifada _ although it has the military
wherewithal to do so.
   ``It's very painful for us to kill people,'' he said. Shamir
also said that ``I personally believe it's possible'' to ultimately
resolve the question of sovereignty over the territories.
   Shamir, who will continue his U.S. tour this week with a series
of private visits around the country, made his television
appearance just hours after his longtime rival, Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, said the Jewish state is negotiating through U.S.
auspices with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Speaking on Israel radio, Peres said Israel had, in effect,
abandoned its longstanding refusal to talk to the PLO by letting
the United States mediate an Israeli proposal for holding elections
in the occupied territories.
   Shamir seemed taken aback when asked about this Sunday.
   ``Well, I don't know what Shimon Peres said,'' he said. `` ...
And I will refrain from any comments on his words. I have to be
cautious.''
   But Shamir said a short time later that he believes the PLO
still advocates the destruction of Israel, regardless of Chairman
Yasser Arafat's statements last year renouncing that.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, asked about the Peres
statements during the ABC interview, said, ``I don't think I should
characterize it and judge it if the prime minister of Israel is
unwilling to do so.
   ``It's not up to me, I don't think, to make a judgment about
whether they feel they are negotiating with the PLO,'' Baker said.
``I'm quite sure they don't feel that way and they are very adamant
in their determination not to.''
   Shamir and President Bush held talks last week in which they
agreed that Shamir's proposal for elections among the Palestinians
living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip could set in motion a
process that could eventually bring about peace in the region.
   On Sunday, Shamir brushed aside questions about what he thought
of the U.S. position that Israel should trade land for peace,
saying ``the parties will have to negotiate and come to an
agreement.''
   But he said: ``I cannot imagine that elections will be possible
under the pressure of violence. You cannot have at the same time
violent manifestations and free, democratic elections.''
   Baker said he agreed with Shamir that ``it's pretty tough to
conduct fair and democratic elections in an atmosphere of
violence.''
   But he said, ``I do not read him to be saying that, as a
requirement for negotiations with Palestinians ... that there
somehow has to be an end to the intifada in advance. I don't think
that would work.''
   Since December 1987, Israel has faced a Palestinian uprising in
those lands that has left more than 420 Palestinians and 18
Israelis dead. Pressure has grown on Israel to open talks with the
PLO since Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism. His
declarations led the United States to reverse a 13-year policy of
refusing to talk to the PLO.
   Shamir said his election proposal envisions a two-stage process
in which Palestinians would first elect representatives to set up
``an interim arrangement of self-rule'' for up to three years.
   ``This will be a transitional period, a test period, in which we
will see if we can live together, cooperate, and then after this
period ... we will start of process of negotiations about the
permanent status of these territories,'' he said.

   Officials warned those attending a
performance Sunday by rock star Rod Stewart that they would be
screened for alcohol, drugs and weapons after about 400 people were
injured at his concert in Monterrey.
   State Attorney General Francisco Guerra Malo promised to
dispatch 1,500 police officers, firefighters, and medical workers
to the city's soccer stadium to ``protect the citizenry from
possible violent acts.''
   Guerra Malo was quoted in a report Saturday by the government
news service Notimex, which did not mention Friday's incident.
Witnesses and relief officials said impatient fans surged toward
the stage when the Scottish singer was 1{ hours late, causing three
people to suffer broken bones and many others to have bruises and
other minor injuries.
   The concert in Queretaro, about 120 miles northwest of Mexico
City, is the second stop of a four-city Mexican tour that Stewart
began before 50,000 fans in Monterrey, an industrial center 600
miles north of Mexico City.

   Wynton Marsalis and his band, George Benson and
Freddie Hubbard are among jazz musicians who will play an all-night
benefit on Tuesday for jazz trumpeter Woody Shaw, who lost an arm
in a subway fall in February.
   ``The fact that he's still alive _ we're very thankful for
that,'' said alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, who plans to play at
the benefit at Sweetwater's, a restaurant near Lincoln Center.
Watson and Shaw were once fellow members of Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers.
   ``I hope he can recover. He's a phenomenal musician. He hears a
piece of music once and memorizes it,'' Watson said.
   Shaw, 44, who lost his sight to degenerative eye disease several
years ago, fell from a subway platform into a train's path on Feb.
27. Surgeons were unable to reattach his left arm, which was nearly
severed at the elbow.
   Shaw returned to Newark, N.J., his hometown, last year after
teaching and traveling in Europe.
   As leader of the Woody Shaw Quintet he was rated the top jazz
trumpet player of 1978 in Downbeat magazine's poll. His album
``Rosewood'' was ranked No. 1 jazz album in that poll.

   Nearly 30 years after beginning a
television career that led to a starring role in the campy ``Lost
in Space,'' Mark Goddard is back in his hometown of Scituate as
host of a weekly cable show.
   Goddard played Maj. Don West, an earnest spaceship pilot who
played straight man to the devious Dr. Smith, in the CBS series
from 1965 to 1968. Some independent stations still carry reruns of
the show, which has charmed some fans of retro entertainment with
its outdated special effects and moralistic plots.
   ``People want to talk about the show, and that's fine and you
don't want to burst anyone's bubble ... but `Lost in Space' I was
not proud of,'' Goddard said in an interview published Saturday in
The Patriot Ledger of Quincy. ``On a scale of one to 10 as an
actor, on `Lost in Space' I was a one.''
   After that series, he worked as an agent and spent much of the
1970s as a self-described ``househusband'' to his second wife,
actress Susan Anspach. Except for a few guest spots, he didn't
return to acting until 1978, when he performed for a year on
Broadway as Lisa Minnelli's lover in ``The Act.''
   Last year, Goddard decided to return to his hometown, 30 miles
south of Boston, and to finish college. He produces his own
Saturday morning show for young people on Continental Cablevision
called ``Not So Strictly Speaking.''

   Jim Abbott, the baseball pitcher born
without a right hand, lost his major league debut game, but his
manager defended the rookie's performance.
   ``I thought under the conditions, he was outstanding,''
California Angels manager Doug Rader said. ``No matter what
happened tonight, it's the long haul that counts and I think he'll
have a long ride.''
   The 21-year-old pitcher was more difficult on himself after
being pulled out with bases loaded in the fifth inning of a 7-0
loss Saturday to the Seattle Mariners.
   ``Right now, it's hard to look at this day in a real positive
light. The way things went kind of took the sweetness out of it,''
Abbott said.
   The U.S. Olympic star, who never played in the minor leagues,
gave up six runs, three of which resulted from two errors by
teammates.
   ``There was definitely some nervousness,'' he said. ``I wish I
could do it over again. I'm disappointed about the way it went.''
   ``Maybe in a few years _ I hope I'm still around _ I can look
back and say, `Gosh, things weren't so bad,''' he said. ``But I
don't feel too good right now.''
   The crowd of about 46,847 gave Abbott a standing ovation.

   Everyone at Covenant House, a shelter for young
people just off Times Square, seems to have a different idea of
what motivates the 350 people who volunteer some of their time
there each week.
   ``You should volunteer because you'll learn a lot about
generosity, humility, giving of yourself,'' says the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, the shelter's founder.
   ``Voluntarism has become more necessary,'' says Arlene
Stepputat, director of volunteers. ``It was an answer to all the
cutbacks in social services.''
   The federal government has encouraged such an answer, which is
why this is National Volunteer Week. The Covenant House Volunteer
Department is among 18 recipients of a President's Volunteer Action
Award, which Ritter, Ms. Stepputat and Andrew Boone, a
representative of the agency's volunteers, are scheduled to receive
Monday night at the White House.
   ``I volunteered after having asked myself for the hundredth time
what could I do,'' said Kristin King, who has been a volunteer for
more than a year. ``I was tired of walking by homeless people on
the street. I decided not to be helpless anymore.''
   ``I do it more for myself now than for the kids,'' said Kevin
Callahan, who works at Covenant House every Monday night. ``Of
course, they benefit, too. You know that you're needed, especially
after you serve dinner for a couple of hundred kids.''
   There are volunteers at all Covenant House programs, including
those in Anchorage, Alaska; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Houston; Los
Angeles; and New Orleans; and in Canada, Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras and Panama.
   The agency said that in 1988, the New York program served more
than 12,700 youths, some of whom returned more than once for help.
The nationwide crisis hotline for youths and their families
(1-800-999-9999) took a million calls, the agency said.
   After taking training, volunteers at Covenant House staff the
computer room, the library and the gym. They serve meals, sort
clothes, interview new residents, escort youngsters to hospitals.
They ride the Outreach van, which goes into the city's seedy
districts to try to get homeless youngsters off the streets.
   Volunteers also work on the New York shelter's Special Needs
Floor, which serves youngsters with AIDS and related diseases.
   It's not easy to be a volunteer.
   ``The hardest part is saying no to the kids, even when you know
you have to,'' says Ann Turnbull, who began volunteering in
February. ```No, you can't have another juice, no, you can't take
three pairs of socks, no, no, no.
   ``You've talked with these kids, and you've gotten some idea of
how terrible their lives are and you want to load them up with
juice and socks.''
   ``The hardest thing is seeing the kids who won't make it,'' said
Chris Foote, who has volunteered for more than a year.
   ``You just have to keep coming here, giving as much as you can.
Any job you do here involves love _ it doesn't matter what you do.''
   Most of the part-time volunteers arrive at night, after work,
and are between the ages of 25 to 40, said Ms. Stepputat. About 90
percent of them hold full-time jobs. There are also retirees.
   Full-time volunteers include the Covenant House board and those
in the Faith Community, nicknamed Ritter's ``peace corps,'' who
donate about a year each to work with street kids.
   Even if Covenant House had money for more staff counselors, Ms.
Stepputat said it would still rely heavily on volunteers because
they ``bring a specialness that money cannot buy.'' she said. ``It
just can't.''

   The cash would have come in handy in the
1960s, when he adopted nine orphans and had five of his own

winning $6 million in the Michigan lottery.
   Chuck Fisher, 62, of Lansing, Mich., said Friday he plans to
leave his job as assistant to the director of the Michigan
Department of Transportation and settle down with his winnings.
   In the early 1960s, he and his wife, Kerry, adopted nine
Sheboygan children whose father had died falling from a ladder.
   Fisher, then a reporter for The Sheboygan Press, knew the
children from having covered the story of their mother's death of
leukemia five years earlier.
   He said he bought his winning ticket at a variety story in a
Lansing mall and had the numbers selected for him at random by a
Michigan lottery computer.
   At a press conference Friday, he received the first of 19 annual
$300,000 checks. After withholding taxes, Fisher netted $240,000 on
the first check.
   The Fishers' children, ranging in age from 27 to 39, live in

   Saturday was a different story, although the crowds were smaller

   Saxophones, banjos, drums, xylophones, violins, cellos and
accordians provided accompaniment to the antics of feather-clad
strutters.
   Duffy String Band's costumes had a patriotic red, white and blue

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Showdown, Base Closing Debate On Tap In Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress appears headed for its first domestic
policy showdown with President Bush this week along with allotting
considerable time to debate an issue likely to cause some lawmakers
discomfort at home.
   The confrontation with Bush is over the minimum wage, with
Senate Democrats planning passage by midweek of legislation to
raise the base wage to $4.55 an hour by late 1991 despite repeated
vows by the president to veto any measure boosting the hourly
minimum above $4.25.
   As the Senate puts the finishing touches on its minimum wage
bill, the House will spend 10 hours debating a plan that calls for
closing 86 military facilities and curtailing operations at an
additional 59.
   It also could be the last week of deliberations in the House
ethics committee's review of allegations that Speaker Jim Wright
broke House rules. And one of Wright's allies plans to file ethical
charges against the speaker's chief accuser, newly elected House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   As for the minimum wage, final congressional passage of the plan
being pushed by the Democratic leadership would all but certainly
result in a veto from Bush, who made it clear last week he will
stand his ground despite concerns by some in the GOP that Democrats
could gain a political issue.
   ``I have no intention of budging one inch on this,'' the
president said Friday.
   Bush has said he would support three 30-cent increases in the
minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981, over the
next three years provided newly hired workers could be paid the
existing minimum wage their first six months on the job.
   Democrats have balked at the president's ``training wage''
proposal and say his $4.25 an hour final target is too low. Their
plan would bring the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour by October 1991
and allow a subminimum for only two months.
   With the showdown appearing inevitable, Democrats last week
began painting the issue as one of fairness.
   ``The president wants to give a tax cut of $30,000 a year to the
richest 1 percent of Americans but he's against 30 cents an hour
more for the millions of poor working Americans at the bottom end
of the income scale,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
referring to Bush's plan for an expansion of capital gains tax
breaks. ``That's wrong and unfair.''
   A final Senate vote on the minimum wage bill is due Tuesday or
Wednesday. Whether the bill heads immediately to the White House
depends on whether the final Senate language for the ``new hire''
wage matches the House bill.
   The lengthy base-closing debate in the House will give lawmakers
from affected communities time to voice their concerns.
   But the plan does not allow for any changes _ Congress must
either allow all of the closings and revisions or block all of
them. Because of that, the measure is expected to pass. The
commission that drafted the plan said it would save $5.6 billion
over 20 years.
   The Senate must take up the base-closing plan by May.

<HEAD>Florida Governor Has National Guardsmen To Fight Brush Fires</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez called out two
helicopter crews from the Florida National Guard on Sunday to help
fight wildfires covering about 30,000 acres of rural land in four
counties.
   The fires were burning in mostly unpopulated areas and weren't
expected to force any immediate evacuations, said Rod Westall,
chief of the state Bureau of Emergency Planning.
   Winds of 5 to 15 mph were hampering efforts to control the
blazes in both northern Florida and Dade County, while drought
conditions statewide had disaster officials watching for further
outbreaks.
   ``That's pretty brisk and that's been causing problems with all
the fires,'' Westall said of the wind.
   Martinez signed an executive order allowing the guard to provide
equipment and personnel, if needed, to the Division of Forestry.
   ``The worst mistake we could make would be to wait too long and
let these fires get out of control,'' said Martinez. ``The affected
areas so far are relatively rural, but we must act quickly to make
sure these fires do not threaten large residential areas.''
   As of noon Sunday, state forestry officials reported that 20,000
acres had been burned in western Dade County near the southern tip
of the state; 6,000 acres in Lafayette and Taylor counties in the
northern part of the state; and about 3,000 acres in Hendry County
in the south-central part of the state.
   Westall said the Dade County fire had not reached Everglades
National Park.
   Initially, the guard was planning to mobilize two helicopters to
fly spotter patrols over the fires to help coordinate ground crews.
More guardsmen may be used later.
   ``At this point, we're just making sure the Division of Forestry
and the Florida National Guard are getting together to provide the
resources that the division is needing,'' he said.
   In North Port, in southern Sarasota County in the west-central
part of the state, firefighters on Saturday contained a wind-wept
blaze that blackened about 2,500 acres, forced the brief evacuation
of 80 homes and contributed to an accident on a smoky highway.
   The blaze started Friday within 500 feet of an elementary school
and changed direction five times, said North Port police spokesman
Bob Lovett. Arson was suspected.
   Lovett said about 80 homes in residential areas near the fire
were evacuated Friday night and residents were free to return early
Saturday.
   Only minimal damage was done to homes near the fire.
   Smoke from the blaze caused police to block off a section of
Interstate 75 near the North Port exit early Saturday morning.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Nurses Killed 44 Patients, Fourth Nurse Arrested</HEAD>

   Authorities arrested a fourth nurse
Sunday in connection with the deaths of 44 hospital patients who
police say were killed by lethal injections.
   Police Chief Guenter Boegl told a news conference the first
three nurses arrested had confessed to killing patients they
considered seriously ill. Another investigator said the nurses also
killed patients they considered a nuisance.
   Initial reports said the killings in Lainz hospital occurred in
the past year, but Boegl said Sunday the slayings began in 1983. He
said 30 police investigators were searching death registers and
other hospital records to check for more victims.
   ``Things are assuming terrifying dimensions,'' the police chief
said on a later television interview.
   The nurses, women ranging from 25 to 39 years of age, were in
custody, but no formal charges had been filed by late Sunday. Three
of the nurses were apprehended Friday, and police said a fourth was
arrested at her apartment Sunday.
   Franz Priessnitz, a senior police official involved in the
investigation, said a 30-year-old nurse was suspected of killing
about 20 patients.
   ``The suspects say that they killed out of pity,'' Boegl said.
However, he said 22 people were killed by forced infusions of
water, adding ``those deeds do not lend credence to this version.''
   Priessnitz said Saturday the nurses also killed patients whom
they considered a nuisance.
   Police officials involved in the investigation said the patients
were aged 75 to 80.

   The government has passed strict new laws aimed at
quelling ethnic unrest and burgeoning calls for change in the
Soviet system, including mandating prison terms and fines for
anyone who publicly insults a government body.
   The Tass news agency said the decree was approved Saturday at a
meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
   That was a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
returned from London to more ethnic unrest, this time in the
southern republic of Georgia. Sixteen people were killed early
Sunday when soldiers dispersed thousands of protesters in the
city's center.
   As president, Gorbachev is chairman of the Presidium. The move
by the collective presidency signaled the Kremlin's determination
to crack down on unrest, even at the cost of an improved human
rights image.
   Tass said the decree prohibits ``public appeals for undermining
and overthrowing the Soviet state and social system, as well as the
publication or circulation of materials containing such ideas.''
   Such actions can be punished by three years in jail and a fine
of up to $3,200 _ almost an entire year's salary for an average
Soviet worker. Carried out repeatedly, or by an organized group,
the same actions are punishable by a prison term of up to seven
years.
   The decree imposes prison terms of up to three years and fines
of up to $3,200 for ``public insults or the discrediting of the
U.S.S.R. supreme bodies of state power and government,'' as well as
government and public organizations formed by it.
   Tass said the decree also prohibits appeals to kindling ethnic
tensions and racial hostility and appeals to commit treason.
   It could not be determined how Soviet authorities would use
their new powers, but the language was broad enough that it could
be used against protesters like those in Georgia, who were
demanding independence from the Soviet Union, as well as more
moderate grassroots political organizations in the Baltic republics.
   Sergei Petrov, a Soviet who long has been refused permission by
authorities to emigrate to the United States, charged that the
decree ``crosses out all they promised'' at the recently completed
Vienna conference on security and cooperation in Europe.
   Petrov said he regarded the new decree, as outlined by Tass, as
worse than existing laws, which require that the defendant
knowingly was spreading lies.
   Two Soviet laws now prohibit anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda and anti-Soviet slander, and they were used for years to
imprison dissidents and Jewish refuseniks.
   Article 70 of the criminal code prohibits ``agitation or
propaganda carried on for the purpose of subverting or weakening
Soviet authority'' and ``circulating ... slanderous fabrications
which defame the Soviet state and social system.''
   Article 190 is aimed particularly at limiting spoken ``slander''
against the Soviet system.
   In October, Justice Minister Boris Kravtsov told the Tass news
agency that Article 190 would be eliminated and Article 70 would be
substantially rewritten under a series of legal reforms.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Acknowledge They Have Few Alternatives to Bush Education
Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress was generally critical of the $441
million education package offered last week by President Bush, but
many members and their staffs acknowledged they have few
alternatives to the president's initiatives.
   Instead, most argue that scarce funds should be used to
strengthen successful existing programs which have already been
authorized and they say they'll use the budget appropriations and
authorization process to make their point.
   ``We don't have anything that would be an alternative to Bush's
program,'' said one House Education and Labor Committee staffer.
   He said the panel might make changes in the school improvement
act passed last year to incorporate some of the Bush proposal ``but
they would not be offering anything totally new this session.''
   ``We want to see the current law implemented,'' echoed committee
Chairman Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.
   ``There's no need fooling around with new programs when you're
not implementing the current ones,'' he said.
   ``Why take money out of successful programs if money is
limited?'' queried Hawkins.
   The Education Excellence Act proposed by Bush would include:
   _a $250 million grant program to reward schools that have cut
drug use or dropout rates, raised standard test scores or improved
in other ways,
   _$100 million on a new magnet schools program,
   _and $7.6 million for grants to outstanding teachers.
   Other parts of the bill would develop new ways to certify
teachers, help urban schools and enlarge the endowments of
historically black colleges.
   Some lawmakers praised the president's efforts to reward
educational excellence, but said current programs that serve a
greater number of students and teachers should be expanded.
   Republican Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey said the Pell grants
and student loan programs which help defray college tuition costs
are highest on her list of priority programs because she said they
are important to the nation's competitive future.
   ``I'd like to see those existing programs fully funded,'' said
Roukema.
   ``We can't continue to add to these programs and not understand
the tax and budget consequences,'' she added.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, from whom the grant program got its name,
emphasized that Bush had not clarified whether the new programs
would be funded with new money or from cuts to existing programs.
   ``This is of equal concern to me,'' said the Rhode Island
Democrat.
   However, Pell said he was disappointed that Bush's package
``does not contain specific proposals to strengthen critically
important programs already in existence'' _ programs such as
Chapter 1 for low-achieving children, compensatory education for
disadvantaged children and Pell grants.
   ``These programs form the foundation of the federal commitment
to provide educational opportunity and access for students in
need,'' Pell said.
   Many, like Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., recognize the
president's proposal as ``only a first step.'' But he said Bush
would have to take greater steps than the less than 2 percent
spending boost he has proposed because ``that's only half of what
it would take to keep up with inflation.''
   However, Roukema zeroed in on the likely costs for the
president's program and any competing ideas. ``Since they have to
be authorized, one could debate at the authorization level, but the
real fight, I guess, will come in appropriations.''
   At any rate, Congress is likely ``to make its case at each point
along the way,'' said Roukema.

<HEAD>Kentuckians Going Wild Over New Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentuckians have gone wild over their new
lottery, and horse racing officials are worried that the
state-sponsored games will cut into the money laid down at the
state's venerable racetracks.
   From the opening of the lottery Tuesday through Saturday
evening, $20 million worth of scratch-off tickets were sold, and
the first week of sales should top $25 million, said Frank O.
Keener, president of the Kentucky Lottery Corp., the private group
that operates the games.
   If they hit $30 million, it would set a state per-capita sales
record now held by Florida, which had $8 worth of sales for each
citizen when the lottery began there last year, he said.
   Lottery tickets were a hot item in Salyersville, in economically
depressed eastern Kentucky.
   ``About once a year the carnival comes to town, and it takes all
the loose change out of here,'' said Mayor Joe Howard. ``Now the
lottery's here, and it'll take out money all year around.''
   At Lexington's Keeneland Race Course, where a 16-day meet began
Friday, the first-day handle was down almost $1 million from last
year's opening, although officials said the downturn could in part
be due to unseasonably cold weather.
   ``There are just so many leisure dollars out there,'' said
William Greely, Keeneland president. He said the lottery would
represent ``one more slice of the pie.''
   But some racing officials think the lottery, however popular at
the moment, has little chance of eroding Kentucky's deep-rooted
interest in racing.
   ``The lottery is primarily a game of chance, and thoroughbred
horse racing and harness horse racing involve a skilled decision on
your part based on many factors,'' said Lyle Robey, chairman of the
Kentucky State Racing Commission.
   ``The lottery may be fashionable now. I don't ever see it taking
over thoroughbred gambling interests.''
   Experience from other states shows that lottery sales usually
slow after the first week, said Larry Sipes, executive vice
president of the Kentucky Lottery Corp.
   The state had garnered about $7.1 million in lottery income by
Saturday. There were at least 26 $5,000 winners in the
``DreamStakes'' game, and 380 people had won $1,000, the grand
prize in ``Beginner's Luck.'' The DreamStakes winners get to enter
in another drawing tied to next month's Kentucky Derby.
   Connie Phan, manager of a Lexington Convenient Food Mart, said
food and other sales had dropped by $200 or $300 a day.
   ``This area, the money is very limited for them,'' said Mrs.
Phan, whose store is located near a low-income section of the city.
``Lots of people are on welfare and food stamps.''
   ``A lot of them will come in and pick some of them up in the
morning, they'll come back at lunch, and then they come back after
work,'' said Steve Finley, assistant manager at a Louisville
convenience store.
   ``It's been wild, it really has,'' said Beverly Allen, assistant
manager of a Gulf service station. One man spent three hours at the
counter scratching off $100 in tickets, then went home and came
back with more money, she said.

   Cold weather slowed the rise of the Red
River on Sunday, giving a reprieve to weary homeowners who have
fought flooding with pumps, dikes and heaps of sandbags.
   The river, which forms the boundary between Minnesota and North
Dakota, was expected to crest Sunday evening a foot lower than had
been anticipated.
   ``The river seems to be slowing down, and that's good news,''
Col. Roger Baldwin of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said during
a tour of the flood-ravaged area with Gov. Rudy Perpich. The
governor later said he would ask for federal disaster relief.
   The bloated river flooded Breckenridge and Wahpeton, N.D.,
across the river last week, damaging as many as 900 homes and
forcing the evacuation of scores of people.
   Lou Bennett, chief meterologist for the National Weather
Service, said cold weather Saturday night in Moorhead and Fargo,
N.D., helped slow the runoff from the winter's plentiful snowfall.
   Temperatures fell into the teens Saturday night and stayed well
below freezing Sunday. Daytime highs usually are in the 40s during
this time of the year.
   The weather service changed its crest prediction to 35{ feet for
the two communities. Forecasters had been expecting a 36{-foot
crest on Monday.
   Bennett said cold weather should cause the water to drain away
more slowly. The river was expected to remain above its 17-foot
flood stage at Fargo for at least 10 days, he said.
   Residents of Fargo and Moorhead had ample time to prepare for
the flood. Hundreds of homeowners built sandbag dikes around their
property to keep out encroaching water.

   Decades ago, daughters of Civil War
soldiers were promised they would be looked after for life in the
stately Confederate Home for Women, but the eight women still
living in the landmark are being moved to make more room for a
museum, officials said.
   The women, age 84 to 98, surrendered their worldly possessions
and future inheritance in exchange for the promise of lifetime care
in the two-story building nestled among the magnolias behind the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
   Once the women are moved, the museum will take the building for
its own use, and the antiques filling the home will be sold.
   ``The museum wants our home,'' said Faye Oliff, a member of the
home's board of governors who opposed the move. ``They want it so
bad. They've been like damn vultures waiting for the ladies to die
so they can get it.''
   The Confederate Home for Women is located near historic Monument
Avenue, lined with statues of rebel generals celebrating the days
when Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. Dozens of
daughters of Confederate soldiers have lived in the home since the
1930s.
   But after more than a year of negotiations among key
legislators, museum officials and the home's board of directors, a
decision has been reached to turn the home over to the museum, and
send the women to a modern place 20 miles out of town, The
Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger Star of Norfolk reported Sunday.
   The women themselves won't find out about the move until later
this week, officials said. They will lose dozens of worn but
valuable antiques in use in the home, some they or previous
residents brought threre, others bequeathed by wealthy Southerners.
   The antiques will be sold off, with board members receiving
first dibs at prices based on a 9-year-old appraisal, the newspaper
reported.
   ``Something needs to be done to stop (the private sale),'' Ms.
Oliff said. ``I think it all ought to be sold at public auction to
ensure the home gets a fair price for it.''
   Ms. Oliff said she tried unsuccessfully to persuade other board
members to open the home to paying descendants of Confederate
soldiers. The board also denied her proposal that a smaller home
for the women be opened about eight blocks away.
   The antiques included a 1770 Chippendale American-made mahogany
grandfather clock, valued at $5,000 according to a recent appraisal
by R.E. Crawford and Associates of Richmond. The clock was
appraised for about one-fifth that much in 1980, said Holly C.
DeJarnette, the home's administrator.
   Museum officials and legislators denied they had pressured the
home to close, and said board members first suggested it.
   ``They came to us,'' said Hunter Andrews, Democratic chairman of
the state Senate Finance Committee.

   Calvin Coolidge was president and letters
took 2-cent stamps when postman August Sutter started his rounds on
the backroads of central Illinois.
   Sixty years, 11 presidents and 13 postal rate increases later
he's still at it, the longest-serving postal employee in the
country.
   ``I was very fortunate to have a job during the Depression,''
Sutter said.
   When he started his route in 1929, Sutter motored a Model-T Ford
over the 31 miles of country roads. During the spring he used a
horse to deliver the mail because the dirt roads turned to mud and
were impassable by car.
   Now he drives a white Oldsmobile Cutlass more than 80 miles each
day to about 139 postal patrons _ including three of his original
customers.
   ``You're out there where there's no pressure, you're out there
with nature and you see things, watch things grow, talk to
people,'' he said.
   On Saturday, the U.S. Postal Service organized a party at the
Raymond Post Office to celebrate Sutter's 80th birthday.
   Coffee and sweets were laid out for the affair, including a
2-foot red, white and blue cake decorated with the postal service's
eagle emblem.
   ``I thanked my patrons for putting up with me for 60 years,
because you make a few errors in your life _ you know,
miss-throws,'' Sutter said, using the postal carriers' jargon for
delivering mail to the wrong person's box.
   Sutter, who will be honored in Washington next month, has served
longer than any of the other 800,000 postal service employees, said
George Skinner, a spokesman for the service in suburban Chicago.
   The biggest change between 1929 and now, Sutter said, is
blacktop. In the early years the length of his working day depended
on what the rain, sleet and snow were doing to the roadway.
   Sutter started out at $2,010 a year, with a 5-cents-a-mile
equipment allowance. His salary has risen to about $23,000, the
allowance to 31{ cents.
   Sutter says he has no plans to retire at least until January,
when he completes another year on the job.
   ``If the health's good, I may continue,'' he said.

   Gasoline prices rose more than a dime after
the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the greatest single price
increase in the history of the U.S. gasoline market, according to a
national survey.
   The average retail price of a gallon of gasoline from March 17
to April 7 rose to 110.63 cents, up from the previous 100.37 cents,
Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey, said Sunday. But
she said there were signs prices were easing.
   The increase in wholesale prices was a tenth of a penny greater
than the retail increase. ``It can be said it was the quickest as
well as the greatest wholesale price hike in the history of the
U.S. gasoline market,'' Lundberg said.
   ``Without factoring in inflation, this also was the fastest and
greatest rise for retail,'' she said.
   The average price includes all taxes, grades of gasoline and
both self-service and full-service pump prices. The Lundberg Survey
samples prices from 17,000 gasoline stations in the United States.
   The surge in gas prices followed the brief shutoff of Alaskan
oil shipments after the tanker accident temporarily closed the Port
of Valdez. It has since reopened, and Lundberg said prices already
were beginning to fall by Sunday.
   Some distributors who sell to gasoline stations accused
independent refineries of taking advantage of the spill, which
briefly cut off 40 percent of California's crude supply, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   ``When the news got out, the refiners were all of a sudden
saying they're out of gasoline,'' said Bill Wright, owner of Wright
Oil Co. of Santee. ``They raised prices as high as they could to
stop the demand for their gasoline, because every gallon they sold
that day was a gallon they wouldn't be able to sell the next week
for a lot more money.''
   Lundberg defended the price rises from refineries.
   ``It was a price response ... stemming from actual cutbacks in
crude oil and refined product, and a preventive mechanism by which
the refiners did not want to run out,'' she said.
   She said refiners faced a dilemma in the past three weeks.
   ``You have your choice of supplying to whoever comes quick and
takes all you've got,'' she said. ``Or you raise your price and
make sure all your accounts get some, and you don't have panic
buying among accounts and consumers. The refiners, at large, chose
that tactic.''
   While no data have been gathered, Lundberg said recent informal
reports indicated that ``prices are already slipping back, both for
wholesale and on the street.''
   But Lundberg cautioned that gasoline prices had been rising
before the Valdez spill, and that ``natural'' price rise will
eventually meet the rates descending from the upward spurt caused
by the spill.
   Gasoline price increases not influenced by the Valdez spill
include more demand as the summer vacation season approaches and
tighter environmental restrictions on refineries, which increase
the cost of making fuel, she said.
   The survey prices for April 7 came three weeks after the last
report. The Lundberg Survey normally comes out every two weeks, but
was on a scheduled hiatus that had nothing to do with the oil spill.
   The prices for self-service gasoline stations, which now make up
80 percent of the domestic market, were: regular unleaded 100.96
cents, up from 90.09 cents a gallon; premium unleaded, 115.80
cents, up from 106.24 cents a gallon; regular leaded, 100.56 cents,
up from 87.72.
   Full service prices included regular unleaded for 126.58 cents a
gallon, up from 118.72; premium unleaded for 138.07 cents, up from
130.08 cents; and 124.22 for regular leaded, up from 115.13 cents.
   The highest overall average retail price recorded this decade by
the Lundberg Survey was 137.82 cents a gallon in March 1981, while
the lowest was 84.63 cents a gallon, recorded in November 1986.

   With cries of ``choice'' and symbolic coat
hangers hung from their clothing, hundreds of thousands of abortion
rights activists marched Sunday on the nation's Capitol hoping to
avert a return to the days of back-alley abortions.
   ``We're scared,'' said Ellen Davidson, a Yale University junior
from Hewlett, N.Y. Scared, she said, because ``we're coming to the
realization that the thing we've taken for granted can be taken
away.''
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments April 26 in a Missouri
case that pro-choice and anti-abortion forces agree could
significantly alter the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that gave women
the right to an abortion.
   ``I'm thrilled to have my baby,'' said Kristin McNamara of
College Park, Md., as she wheeled 4-week-old Kathryn in a stroller
during the march from the Washington Monument to the Capitol. ``But
I think a woman must have a choice to decide whether and when to
have a child.''
   Law enforcement authorities estimated the rally crowd at
300,000. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority, said it was more than 600,000. By comparison, some 90,000
people gathered for a March 1986 pro-abortion rally in Washington.
   The turnout was higher than even organizers had predicted, and
Sunday they were speaking of a new-found political clout.
   ``It's a turning point. It's a totally new ball game,'' Smeal
said. ``It's given us the confidence that we are the majority.''
   The women's rights advocates _ men and women, Democrats and
Republicans and a host of celebrities _ traded taunts with about
200-300 anti-abortion protesters who stood along the Constitution
Avenue march route. Police, some on horseback, kept the opposing
forces apart.
   The anti-abortion activists set up a symbolic ``Cemetery of the
Innocents'' on the Washington Mall containing 4,400 white wooden
crosses and Stars of David. That, organizers said, is the number of
unborn children killed daily since the Supreme Court legalized
abortion.
   At the Capitol, Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, vowed to ``raise a political army'' to
ensure that abortion rights are protected. ``If they (politicians)
don't get the message, we will replace them with pro-choice.''
   ``We're terribly empowered by this,'' Yard said. ``It means we
can go ahead with what we've planned to do on this issue with more
troops.''
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., declared, ``I have a message for the
man at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the nine Supreme Court
justices. Read my lips. Pro-choice, pro-choice, pro-choice.'' The
crowd picked up the chant.
   President Bush, in one of his first acts after taking office in
January, told anti-abortion activists at a rally outside the White
House he wanted the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision
overturned.
   Speakers suggested Sunday that Bush's wife, Barbara, was
pro-choice. Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, responded,
``Her position is that this is one of those issues where she will
not discuss her views with anyone except, perhaps, her husband.''
   Many of Sunday's demonstrators wore white, the color of the
suffragettes who fought for women's right to vote. Some brought
their young children. They carried signs saying: ``Motherhood
Should Always Be a Choice,'' ``Roe Roe Roe or Sink,'' and ``Going
Public for Privacy.''
   Wire coat hangers were hung from the clothing of many marchers,
who carried signs saying, ``Never Again.'' It was a reference to
the often deadly self-abortion technique used by women in the
United States before the procedure was legalized.
   ``The majority of Americans do not want to see the clock turned
back,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Whoopi Goldberg said: ``Abortion is a negative experience. ...
It's not something you want to go through, but if you need one, you
should have one that's safe. I don't want anyone to end up on the
bathroom floor with a coat hanger.''
   Students came in bus loads from campuses across the country.
Though most are too young to remember the days before the Supreme
Court legalized abortion in 1973, students said they recognize the
threat now posed by a major challenge to that ruling.
   ``Gradually we're believing it's a possibility'' that the right
to abortion could be taken away, said Yale junior, Bryony Romer who
traveled in an entourage of five buses from the New Haven, Conn.,
campus.
   Florence White, a 1933 alumna of Hunter College in New York,
traveled to Washington with students from her alma mater. ``I'm
goddamn angry at the administration,'' she said. ``They want to put
the country back to the stone age.''
   Celebrities said they believed that a massive display of
commitment to protect abortion rights will have an impact on the
Supreme Court when its considers the Missouri challenge to Roe vs.
Wade.
   ``They're human, they're political animals, and I think we can
make a difference,'' said actress Jane Fonda, who attended the
rally with her daughter, 20-year-old Vanessa Vadim.
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, appearing on CBS' ``Face the
Nation,'' defended the abortion law that is before the court.
   ``We hope that any time we can save the life of a child in
Missouri, that we would seek to save the life of that child,'' the
Republican governor said.
   The Missouri statute outlaws abortions and abortion counseling
in public facilities, but still permits abortions in privately run
facilities. It also requires doctors to try to save fetuses aborted
after a specified age of gestation.
   Marcher organizers and supporters acknowledged that abortion
opponents have waged a highly organized campaign to reverse the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision, but they say Sunday's rally
demonstrated pro-choice advocates' passion and commitment.
   ``Today they will be drowned out by our voices and the marching
of our beat,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Several delegations of women from other countries joined the
rally to demonstrate their concern that if abortion is not kept
legal in the United States, other countries will follow that lead.
   ``It's quite terrifying for us to read about what's happening in
the states,'' said Jo Wainer of Melbourne, Australia. ``It really
matters to us what you do here, I hope the United States doesn't
plummet to Third World status in the treatment of women.''

   The world's most complicated watch, which took a
team of jewelers nine years to design and assemble, became the
world's most expensive watch when it was auctioned off in less than
two minutes Sunday for $2.74 million.
   Bidding for the 18-carat gold Patek Philippe watch that packs
1,728 parts _ but must be wound every 30 hours _ began at $1.67
million and moved up quickly.
   The buyer's name was withheld, but the auctioneer _ Habsburg,
Feldman of Geneva _ said he is South American. Along with a 10
percent commission and 6.2 percent federal sales tax, he will pay
$3,169,000 for the timepiece.
   Previously, the highest price paid for a watch at auction was
$1.2 million in 1984 for a clock from the mid-17th century.
   The capacity audience of 700 in the ballroom of Geneva's plush
Hotel des Bergues broke into applause when the gavel sealed the
deal.
   The sale wound up an auction of 291 watches that fetched a total
$15,242,000, making it the world's biggest watch sale. Eighteen
were sold for more than $100,000 each. Ten other watches went
unsold.
   The most expensive timepiece was viewed by nearly 10,000
potential buyers and watch buffs during a pre-sale tour that
stopped in Europe, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
   Made by Geneva's Patek Philippe to mark its 150th anniversary,
the watch is 3.4 inches in diameter and contains 68 springs, 126
jewels and 332 screws.
   It is the first watch in the world that determines the date of
Easter, which varies. And it features a disc of sapphire crystal
showing the Milky Way and 2,800 distinct stars in five sizes
according to their order of magnitude.
   Geza von Habsburg, spokesman for the auctioneers, said that at
the request of the buyer, the watch will be named after a Japanese
goddess of agriculture, ``Kuma.''
   Allowing the first buyer to name the watch is in line with a
tradition followed by the company since it sold an earlier
complicated watch to American automobile tycoon James Ward Packard
for $3,100 in 1927.
   The ``Packard Watch'' was bought back by Patek Philippe for more
than $1.2 million in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Police in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania searched Sunday for
eleven escaped prisoners who remained at large following unrelated
jailbreaks.
   Officials in both states blamed the escapes on overcrowding and
understaffing in outdated jails.
   Thirteen prisoners slipped away from the 173-year-old Norfolk
County House of Corrections in Dedham, Mass., after sawing through
a prison window bar Friday night. Two were recaptured shortly after
the break and five more were arrested in a massive manhunt Saturday.
   In New Castle, Penn., seven prisoners, including a convicted
rapist, escaped the Lawrence County Jail on Saturday evening by
cutting a hole in the metal ceiling of their cell. One was captured
about an hour later and a second turned himself Sunday afternoon.
   The Pennsylvania escape came just days after the New Castle News
ran a lengthy series of articles that described overcrowding at the
jail. Built in 1964 to house 43 minor offenders, the Lawrence
County Jail has been holding nearly three times that number
recently, including several prisoners charged with murder.
   ``It goes back to the same old cliche _ overpopulated and
understaffed,'' deputy warden Anthony Pagley said.
   In Massachusetts, Norfolk County Sheriff Clifford Marshall
offered a similar description of the problems at his jail, the
oldest section of which was built in 1816.
   ``There is no way with 170 people in here we can watch every
facet of the institution,'' Marshall said. ``I would like to think
that we can, but we can't.''
   Actually, although the jail is under a federal cap of 172
inmates, it held 246 inmates on Friday night. Marshall said the
cells have rusted bars that can be cut through easily. A contract
was signed last October to build a new county jail.
   Residents of Dedham, an affluent Boston suburb, responded to the
escape with both anger and resignation.
   ``How can they let 13 guys escape over a wall?'' said Katherine
Leary. ``It's kind of amazing.''
   After cutting through inch-thick window bars, the inmates
crossed a roof and scaled a 15-foot brick wall topped with razor
wire to escape, authorities said.
   Of the six men who were being sought Sunday, two were serving
prison terms of less than a year, one for breaking and entering,
the other for driving to endanger. Four were in jail pending trial,
three for breaking and entering, the fourth for driving to
endanger. They ranged in age from 18 to 37.
   Marshall said someone outside the prison probably tossed
hacksaws over the wall. ``They can cut through these old bars in a
matter of minutes,'' he said. ``And they try it all the time.''
   In New Castle, a town of about 34,000 people 40 miles northwest
of Pittsburgh, the escapees also used a hacksaw blade to cut
through the metal ceiling of their cell, Pagley said. He said
officials do not know where the men got the blade.
   In addition to the one rapist, those at large included three men
awaiting trial for burglary and one for robbery.

<HEAD>Government Says Pakistan Escalating War In Border Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib's government on Sunday
accused Pakistan of escalating Moslem guerrilla attacks in border
regions and said more than 270 people, mostly guerrillas, were
killed over the weekend.
   Heavy rocket and artillery attacks were launched on the eastern
towns of Khost and Ghazni in the past 24 hours while the battle for
the key eastern city of Jalalabad continued, the government said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani told a Kabul news
conference that government troops killed 195 opposition fighters
and wounded 142 in the Jalalabad area. He did not give any
casualties for the government side.
   He also said 54 more fighters were killed by government fire
near Sarobi, which is midway between Jalalabad and Kabul on the
only paved road linking the two cities.
   There was no way to confirm the casualty figures.
   ``If Pakistan continues this kind of unbridled involvement in
the military destructive activities of the extremists against
Afghanistan, it is bearing the responsibility of the grave
consequences,'' Amani said.
   In response to a question, Amani said Afghanistan was not
threatening to declare war.
   In New York, U.N. officials speaking anonymously said Afghan
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil was scheduled to meet
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday. Wakil, who
arrived Saturday, has asked for an emergency meeting of the
Security Council.
   On Friday, a long-range Soviet-made Scud-B missile was fired
from Kabul toward Jalalabad and landed across the border in
Pakistan. The Kabul government said it was an accident. Pakistan
said no one was hurt but protested the incident.
   Afghan government forces have been firing Scuds almost daily for
the past month at the Afghan guerrillas besieging Jalalabad, 45
miles from the Pakistan border. The Pakistan-based guerrillas
launched their offensive on the city 75 miles east of Kabul in
March after a Soviet troop withdrawal was completed in February.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the
Marxist government. The withdrawal was completed Feb. 15 under a
U.N.-brokered agreement.
   Najib and his Soviet-backed Marxist government have long accused
Pakistan of participating in the Afghan civil war by backing the
guerrillas, who also are supported by the United States, Saudi
Arabia and China. But the accusations against Pakistan have
intensified as the Jalalabad battle continues.
   Pakistan denies the charges.
   Amani said Pakistani forces, Arab advisers and the guerrillas on
Saturday launched the attack on Khost, 18 miles from the Pakistan
border, and the fighting continued Sunday.
   He said he had no casualty reports, but he claimed the attack
was led by two Pakistani military officers disguised as Afghans.
   He also claimed the opposition fired shells, rockets and mortars
at Ghazni, 80 miles from the Pakistani border in the past 24 hours,
killing nine civilians and two government soldiers. He said the
government returned fire, killing nine opposition fighters.
   At a checkpoint on the highway east of Kabul, civilians said
Sunday that about two buses were still arriving daily from Sarobi,
but no trucks. They said no traffic from Jalalabad was reaching the
capital.

   The Soviet Union said Sunday that 42 sailors were
killed when a nuclear-powered submarine caught fire and exploded in
the Norwegian Sea, and it disclosed that two torpedoes on board
were armed with nuclear warheads.
   The official Tass news agency said the design of the warheads
``completely rules out'' the threat of radiation when the torpedoes
are under great pressure deep in the water.
   ``To ensure radiation safety, the nuclear-powered engine was
stopped and the power unit was effectively'' turned off, the agency
said.
   It said the submarine carried 69 men and that only 27 of them
survived.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said Sunday
the department had no comment on the Tass statement. President
Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said U.S.
officials had no early indication of a radiation problem.
   ``The indications that we have received from the Soviet Union
are, there is none,'' Scowcroft said said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.''
   The vessel went down in international waters 120 miles southwest
of Norway's Bear Island and about 310 miles west of Tromsoe, on
Norway's northern coast. It was the third serious accident in the
Soviet nuclear fleet in 2{ years.
   Norwegian scientists were gathering deep-water samples Sunday,
and they placed equipment near the sunken ship that would monitor
radiation levels for years. Officials reported the vessel released
no radiation when it caught fire and exploded.
   Tass, in a dispatch from the Soviet Northern Fleet headquarters
in Murmansk, an arctic port, said:
   ``The crew of the torpedo-carrying nuclear-powered submarine was
made up of 69 men. Twenty-seven of them were saved. The crew of the
submarine displayed courage in the struggle for keeping it afloat.''
   Soviet officials said the survivors were rescued by a Soviet
warship and were bound for Murmansk.
   ``The submarine had on board two torpedoes with nuclear
warheads,'' Tass said.
   The torpedoes are designed to prevent radiation leaks even when
deeply submerged, the news agency said. In addition, it said, the
nuclear reactor was shut off and ``deadened'' during the accident
to prevent radioactive contamination of the environment.
   Tass did not identify the nuclear weapons on the sub, which sank
to a depth of more than 4,500 feet.
   The vessel, one of the Soviets' most advanced, was capable of
carrying more than a dozen long-range missiles in addition to the
torpedoes, U.S. officials have said.
   The sub, under the command of Capt. E. Vanin, was on its way
home from a long voyage when fire broke out in a compartment, the
military newspaper Red Star reported Sunday.
   ``The crew bravely fought the fire and tried to save the ship,''
the newspaper said, basing its information on an interview with
Captain P. Ishchenko of the Northern Fleet. ``The fight for life
continued for more than five hours, but with no results.''
   The decision was then made to abandon ship.
   The Soviets officially informed Norway of the accident nearly
nine hours after the vessel went down. The Norwegian news agency
NTB claimed Norwegian rescue helicopters could have reached the
ship several hours before Soviet fishing vessels if the Soviets had
promptly asked for help.
   Soviet officials were criticized for not providing accurate or
timely information after the 1986 explosion and fire at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant. That incident sent a cloud of
radiation into the atmosphere that contaminated crops and livestock
in Europe.
   In Oslo, Defense Ministry spokesman Erik Senstad told a news
conference the Soviets declined an offer of Sea King helicopters
from a Norwegian rescue base 370 miles away, but he refused to say
if more lives could have been saved had they accepted the offer.
   Friday's sinking came five months after a reported near-meltdown
in a nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet icebreaker in Murmansk.
According to the newspaper Vodny Transport, a reactor operator
drained vital cooling water from an operating reactor rather than
one that was shut down for repairs.
   Had the water drained 30 minutes longer, a meltdown releasing
radiation into the air over the city of 440,000 would have
occurred, the newspaper said. The ``situation was liquidated'' in
four minutes, the newspaper said.
   In October 1986, three sailors died in a fire and explosion
aboard a Yankee-class nuclear-powered submarine in the Atlantic
Ocean that was armed with ballistic missiles.

   More than 400,000 voters in the
republic of Montenegro on Sunday elected their representative to
Yugoslavia's nine-member collective presidency.
   It was the first time the election was by secret ballot by the
eligible voters in the republic. Previously, the presidency member
was elected by the republic's Parliament.
   Results were expected Monday in the contest between three
candidates: Nenad Bucin, Mijat Sukovic and Dimitrije Baucal.
   The Montenegro voting was only the second election by secret
ballot in communist Yugoslavia.
   A week ago voters in the republic of Slovenia chose Janez
Drnovsek in a two-candidate race. On May 15 he will become the
federal president and serve for 12 months under the system of
rotating the top post among the members of the nine-man presidency.
   The parliaments of Slovenia and Montenegro still must approve
the results of the elections in their republics.
   The nine-member collective presidency includes representatives
from all six of Yugoslavia's republics, its two autonomous
provinces and the country's Communist Party chief. It was devised
by Yugoslavia's post-World War II leader, President Josip Broz
Tito, who died in 1980.
   ``Now, indeed, everything is in the hands of the working people
and citizens,'' Bozo Stijovic, a Montenegrin Supreme Court judge,
said of Sunday's balloting in an interview with the Politika
Ekspres newspaper.

   Engine failure may have caused the crash
of a military helicopter that injured six Marines on a training
exercise, an Army commander said Sunday.
   In a separate accident, a medical helicopter crashed on takeoff
Sunday from a Houston hospital parking lot, seriously injuring the
three crew members.
   The Houston crash was the second this year in Texas of the
BK-117, made by the MBB Helicopter Corp. of West Germany. The first
wreck also involved a medical crew.
   The commander of Fort McCoy, Army Col. Raymond Boland, said
initial reports of the military crash suggested the UH-1
helicopter's engine failed two miles north of the base headquarters
Saturday afternoon.
   Another officer, Marine Capt. Richard Jessen of the Glenview
Naval Air Station, where some of the injured Marines were based,
said it could take weeks to find the cause.
   The UH-1 is one of the older helicopter models employed by the
U.S. armed forces. It was one of the principal aircraft used in the
Vietnam war.
   Fort McCoy spokeswoman Mary Binder said the three crew members
and three passengers were taken to St. Mary's Hospital in nearby
Sparta for treatment. Five were treated and released while the
pilot remained hospitalized Sunday with minor injuries, she said.
   In Houston, a police officer said he saw the medical helicopter
drifting backward toward an eight-story parking garage at Hermann
Hospital shortly before the crash, prompting speculation the tail
rotor may have smashed into the structure.
   But a medical emergency official said the pilot reported after
the crash that the helicopter malfunctioned on takeoff. There were
swirling winds at the time.
   The three victims were listed in serious and guarded condition.
They suffered spinal damage and were being examined for internal
injuries, said Dr. Kenneth Wells. The pilot struck the controls and
injured his face.
   Officials at the hospital said their Life Flight emergency
medical program has flown more than 35,000 patient missions with
only one previous accident since it began service in 1976. It
employs five mechanics and owns three helicopters.
   Three people were killed on Valentine's Day when a helicopter of
the same model crashed in a wooded area while attempting to return
to a hospital in Tyler, 200 miles north of Houston.

   Heavy snow fell in Kansas and Colorado on Sunday and record cold
settled in over portions of the Great Lakes states. Temperatures
also plunged in Texas, providing relief from sizzling weather the
day before.
   In Northern California, record- or near-record-breaking
temperatures continued as people sought relief from the fifth day
of persistent heat at crowded beaches, seaside boardwalks and
inland waterways.
   Snow began to taper off in the central high Plains, but still
was falling Sunday afternoon. Snowfall totals ranged up to 11
inches at Goodland, Kan., 7 inches at Boulder, Colo., 4 inches at
Garden City, Kan., and 3 inches in Denver.
   A snow advisory was posted for western Kansas, and an advisory
for snow and blowing snow in the northern and central mountains of
Colorado.
   Cold Canadian air continued to descend into the south central
United States. Strong northerly winds blew the cold air into
southern Texas, where temperatures were as much as 40 degrees
colder than at the same time Saturday, when highs were approaching
100 degrees.
   A freeze warning was issued for the northern quarter of
Oklahoma, and a freeze advisory for all of Missouri. There were
snow squalls and snow showers in parts of the Great Lakes region
and upper Mississippi Valley.
   Flooding continued along the Red River and some of its
tributaries in North Dakota, but cold weather is expected to slow
the snowmelt and slow the river's rising over the next few days.
   Scattered light rainshowers extended from eastern Pennsylvania
across southern New England, and from southern and central Alabama
to coastal South Carolina. A few showers and thunderstorms fell
over southern Mississippi and the northern Florida peninsula.
   Skies were mostly cloudy east of the Rockies and generally sunny
in the West.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 18
degrees at Rawlins, Wyo., to 100 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Low temperature records were set or tied in several cities,
including 5 degrees in Marquette, Mich., 20 in Milwaukee, and 25 in
Springfield, Ill.
   The low for the nation was 4 degrees at Houghton, Mich.
   The forecast for Monday called for snow extending from the lower
Great Lakes to northern New England, and rain and snow over parts
of the southern and central Plains. Scattered rainshowers were
expected across much of the nation east of the Mississippi River,
with thunderstorms in the Southeast. Fair to partly sunny skies
were predicted across the rest of the nation, with strong winds in
southern Texas.
   High temperatures were expected to be below 50 degrees from the
high Plains through the middle and upper Mississippi Valley to
North Carolina and the middle and northern Atlantic Coast; in the
30s from eastern North Dakota through the Great Lakes to northern
New England; above 60 from south central Texas to Florida and
southern Georgia, with temperatures in the 70s in the lower Rio
Grande Valley and in the 70s and lower 80s in Florida; and above 70
from western New Mexico to the coast of California and Oregon, with
readings in the 80s and 90s and some over 100 degrees in southern
Arizona, southern Nevada and southern and central California.

   Thousands of demonstrators linked hands Sunday in
an attempt to form a human chain around a northern Japan site where
the government is constructing a plant to reprocess spent nuclear
fuel.
   The protesters joined hands twice for three minutes, but police
said they did not cover the entire eight-mile distance around the
site near Rokkasho village, 320 miles northwest of Tokyo.
   Organizers said about 11,400 people, mostly housewives,
participated. Police put the number at closer to 7,500.
   There were no reports of violence or arrests, police said.
   In addition to reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, the plant is to
serve as an underground storage site for radioactive waste. It is
scheduled to start operation in 1991.
   Critics contend that unfavorable sea, weather and geographic
conditions at the Pacific coast site mean the plant would endanger
nearby communities.
   They also point to its proximity to the U.S. Misawa Air Base.
Last month, a U.S. Air Force plane accidentally dropped a dummy
bomb near a neighboring residential area during a practice exercise.
   ``The nuclear plant will hang over our lives and our
children's,'' said Hiroko Chiba.
   Japan, seeking to reduce its dependence on imported oil, plans
to rely more heavily on nuclear power. Officials have said that by
1995 nuclear plants will provide 36 percent of the country's
energy, up from the current 28 percent.

   A Stalin biographer and the head of an independent
Lithuanian political group were among candidates who competed in
Sunday's runoff elections for seat's in the new Soviet parliament.
   It was the second stage of the Soviet Union's first
multicandidate national elections.
   In the first round on March 26, voters rejected at least 45
government and Communist Party leaders in their bids for seats in
the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   Sunday's runoffs involved 64 districts in which no candidate won
the required 50 percent majority in the first election because
three or more candidates split the vote. Results were not expected
until at least Monday.
   In one race, Stalin biographer Roy Medvedev faced Ksenya
Razumova, head of an atomic research laboratory in Moscow.
Virjiljus Chepaitis, head of the Lithuanian alternative political
group Sajudis, ran against Ivan Tikhonovich, dean of the Vilnius
Pedagogical Institute in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   The 2,250-member congress will choose a new Supreme Soviet, the
country's policy-making body.
   Another round of elections with new candidates will be held May
14 in 123 districts in which candidates ran unopposed and still
lost in the March balloting, and in 76 districts in which two
candidates both failed to garner 50 percent of the vote. Voters
could reject all of the candidates.
   Yuri Solovyov, the Communist Party chief of Leningrad, was among
top party officials across the country who ran unopposed in March
and still were defeated.
   Outside a polling station in Moscow, voters bought orange soda
and chocolate bars after casting their ballots.
   ``It's about the same atmosphere as last time,'' said concession
worker Anatoly Mitin. ``People are in a good mood, it's a pleasant
atmosphere.''
   Vladimir Orlov, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission,
praised the nominating process that led up to the elections.
   ``Candidates were nominated not for their ranks or trumpeted
promises but for their high moral standards and ability to
contribute to the restructuring drive,'' Orlov told the official
news agency Tass.

   Leftist guerrillas and
government soldiers halted fighting Sunday to permit the
vaccination of tens of thousands of children and pregnant women.
   The ``National Vaccination Day'' was the second this year and
the 13th since the program began in 1985. The campaign is carried
out by the Health Ministry, the International Red Cross, UNICEF,
Rotary International and thousands of local volunteers staffing
2,000 vaccination posts.
   Children and pregnant women receive shots to protect against
polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
   Health Minister Benjamin Valdez on Friday called on both sides
in the nation's 9-year-old civil war to respect an unofficial truce
as they have on previous vaccination days.
   There were no reports of fighting Sunday.

   The interior of British
Columbia was jolted early Sunday morning by a mild earthquake.
There were no injuries or damage reported.
   The quake registered only 3.5 on the Richter scale, but shook
people awake when it struck.
   ``The Tremor was strong enough to be noticed but not strong
enough to be of concern,'' said Bob Horner of the Pacific
Geoscience Center. ``This is just one of the normal kinds of events
we see in this area from time to time.
   Salmon Arm, where the quake was centered, is about 200 miles
northeast of Vancouver, and about 100 miles north of the
U.S.-Canada border.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in a local area.

<TEXT>
   The government said Sunday that 96
Sinhalese militants surrendered to police and army troops
apparently in response to President Ranasinghe Premadasa's amnesty
offer.
   Eighty-three militants gave themselves up in north-central
Anuradhapur and Kurunegala, and 13 others surrendered in southern
Moneragala, Galle and Matar, the government said in a statement.
   ``Many others have made contact with security forces wanting to
surrender,'' the statement said.
   Earlier this month, Premadasa announced the amnesty as part of a
peace plan under which Sinhalese and Tamil militants would receive
parliamentary seats and jobs in return for renouncing violence.
   Tamil rebels, fighting a six-year war for an independent
homeland, have not responded to the offer, the government said.
   Tamils, who are predominantly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. They allege discrimination by the mainly
Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and
control the government and military.
   Sinhalese militants stepped up their attacks after the
government signed an India-sponsored peace accord in June 1987. The
pact was aimed at ending the Tamil struggle for self-rule in
northern and northeastern provinces.
   Sinhalese rebels say the 50,000 Indian soldiers in Sri Lanka,
deployed to help the government disarm Tamil rebels, compromise the
country's independence.
   India sponsored the accord because its own 60 million Tamils are
sympathetic to the rebel cause.
   But Sri Lanka's dominant Tamil rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, has rejected the accord, saying it does not
meet enough Tamil demands for self-rule.
   The Tamil rebellion and the Sinhalese backlash have claimed at
least 12,500 lives.

<TEXT>
   The air force received its first upgraded
Phantom jet fighter on Sunday, and officials said the improvements
will keep the nearly 35-year-old planes flying into the next
century.
   Air force commander Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said the revamped
jet, called the Phantom 2000, will be used as a bomber and will be
able to compete with Soviet-made fighters used by the air forces of
many Arab states.
   ``The main mission of the plane will be air-to-ground
capabilities,'' Nun said on Israel radio. ``But it will be able to
deal with threats of the modern battlefield.''
   State-owned Israel Aircraft Industries plans to refurbish at
least 10 Phantom jets a year for the next five to six years at a
cost of less than $8 million a plane, said Yitzhak Geva, head of
the project.
   Israel has 150 Phantoms, according to the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, a think tank in Tel Aviv.
   The U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms are being refitted with advanced
electronic and radar systems that originally were developed for the
Israeli Lavi fighter plane.
   The controversial Lavi project was canceled in 1987 because of
its high cost _ about $40 million per jet fighter.
   Israel received its first Phantoms in the early 1970s. The
director general of Israel Aircraft, Moshe Keret, said the revamped
jet will ``be able to take us well beyond the year 2000.''

   Jane Roe sat in anonymity Sunday just a few
steps from the hundreds of thousands who had gathered to voice
their opposition to reversal of the 1973 Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion that bears her name.
   Occasionally, a handful of reporters would cluster around Roe _
the pseudonym attached to one of the most famous cases in history _
to get her reaction to the rally that drew 300,000 to the nation's
capital.
   And at one point, former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
greeted the slight woman with a bear hug, a squeeze of her cheek
and the words, ``precious.''
   But for most of the afternoon, Roe _ her real name is Norma
McCorvey _ simply sat at the foot of the Capitol with a few
friends, barely noticed by the hundreds of Hollywood stars, rally
volunteers and political activists who filled the stage.
   As it was, the attention was almost too much for McCorvey.
   ``She's shaking,'' said Gloria Allred, a women's rights attorney
from Los Angeles who sat by McCorvey's side. ``She's not used to
all of this.''
   Nevertheless, McCorvey mustered enough courage to answer a few
questions, something she may be doing from now on as she travels
the lecture circuit with a higher profile.
   ``Our law's in jeopardy,'' said McCorvey, who wore a blue
sweatshirt with the words Roe v. Wade and a drawing of the Supreme
Court.
   She plans to return to Washington April 26 when the court hears
arguments in the Missouri case that could reverse Roe v. Wade. If
she had a chance, she would tell the court that the decision ``was
right and you should not change it.''
   In the meantime, McCorvey is looking for a place to live after
someone fired a shotgun at her Texas home.
   ``Your life is in danger and you're still speaking out?''
McCorvey was asked. She nodded in agreement.
   Recently, McCorvey has appeared in Texas and Atlanta at small
speaking engagements to ``tell her story,'' according to the
foundation's organizer, Sarah K. McCallister.
   The ``Jane Roe'' foundation is for ``education and counseling
and to raise consciousness,'' said McCallister, who works at a
construction business in Austin, Texas. McCorvey, she said, cleans
houses.
   ``She gave us a gift 15 years ago,'' McCallister said of the
woman seated next to her. ``She's going to continue.''

   An explosion apparently caused by natural
gas ripped a 40-foot section from a motel on Sunday. Thirty-one
people were injured, but no one was killed and only two people were
hospitalized.
   ``We have witnessed a miracle,'' Fire Department Capt. Marvin
Jochems said after searchers accounted for the last occupant of the
Super 8 Motel.
   ``Everybody is accounted for,'' Jochems said. ``We don't expect
to find any fatalities in the rubble.''
   Thirty-one people were taken to the city's two major hospitals,
but 29 were released after treatment, spokeswomen for the hospitals
said.
   Firefighters aided by a long-armed excavating machine continued
to pick cautiously through the rubble, but Jochems said fire
officials expected to turn the site back to control of the owners
by the end of the day.
   The blast occurred four minutes after someone phoned
Montana-Dakota Utilities at 1:07 a.m. and reported a strong smell
of natural gas, said Dick Blee, the acting Billings fire chief.
Firefighters controlled the blaze by 4 a.m.
   ``The center of the building is gone, and then there's fire
damage both ways,'' said Charlie Allen, acting battalion chief.
   The explosion appeared to be in a central laundry area with
natural-gas lines, Blee said. Individual rooms in the motel have
electric heat.
   ``We couldn't get upstairs or anything, but there were people
jumping out of windows when they heard the explosion,'' said Jan
Hardy, motel night clerk.
   ``I thought somebody was trying to break in the room,'' said one
guest, William Kartsonis of Denver. ``You think it's just a prank,
and then you look out and see the smoke. It's a scary feeling.''
   One couple said the floor of their room seemed to give way, but
the carpet remained fastened around the edges, so they could walk
to the door.
   One man said people who fled all put on some kind of clothing,
but almost none remembered shoes.
   ``We just woke up and threw our clothes on, grabbed a suitcase
and headed down the hall,'' said Jan Hagstrom of Cody. ``The smoke
was really close to the ground already, below our knees.''
   Nearly all guests in the motel in this south-central Montana
city of 75,000 spent the rest of the night in the Holiday Inn on
the other side of Interstate 90.
   ``Our security people went over and brought them over in our
motel van,'' said Ty Paine, assistant manager of the Holiday Inn.
Some who had minor injuries were later taken to a hospital, he said.
   ``The people we have taken in all seem to be in pretty good
spirits,'' Paine said. ``It's pretty devastating when something
like that happens.''
   Super 8 officials would have no comment until the motel's owners
arrived from Aberdeen, S.D., a spokeswoman said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Church bells rang and shoppers
packed markets Sunday as residents emerged after a week in which
loyal troops blocked an attempted coup and crushed a mutiny by army
rebels.
   A Haitian doctor said about 30 soldiers _ 25 rebels and five
loyalists _ were killed in fighting Friday and Saturday in and
around the Dessalines Barracks adjoining the National Palace.
   The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least
15 soldiers supporting Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, were wounded. He said he had no report about the number of
rebels injured.
   At least three civilians were known to have been killed in the
crossfire Saturday but officials at the city's morgues refused to
say how many bodies had been brought in.
   At least six soldiers from the mutinous Leopards Battalion were
killed in battles last week with Avril's Presidential Guard.
   An army communique broadcast at 5:15 p.m. Saturday declared
victory.
   It said soldiers of the Presidential Guard had occupied the
Dessalines Barracks and most of the rebels were captured but some
fled, leaving behind their weapons and uniforms.
   The government has not said how many rebels were captured or
where they were being held.
   The revolt pitted the Presidential Guard and its 1,100 troopers
against some of the 400 members of the Leopards Battlion early last
week, and later the soldiers of the Dessalines Barracks.
   The Dessalines Barracks, with 750 troopers, was the most feared
unit in Haiti's 7,000-man army. Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic
church station, said the commander of the Dessalines Barracks, Col.
Guy Francois, was given asylum at the Vatican Embassy. The embassy
declined comment.
   Francois was identified as one of the leaders of the attempted
coup on April 2. The three other alleged conspirators, all army
officers, were deported last week to the United States.
   Also Sunday, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the U.S.
government has donated $25,000 to the Haitian Red Cross for medical
assistance.
   The fighting with cannons, mortars, grenades, rifles and machine
guns was the fiercest in Haiti's modern history.
   The National Palace, a gleaming white building in the center of
Port-au-Prince, had a hole in the roof from a mortar shell and the
compound of the Dessalines Barracks was scarred by shells and
bullets.
   Soldiers of the Presidential Guard were smiling and casual
Sunday as they guarded the entrance to the barracks. Some cleaned
up the debris.
   ``We're proud,'' one soldier said. ``We did good work.''
   Shoppers filled the streets of the capital to patronize the many
markets and shops open for the first time in several days.
   All reports indicated the fighting had occurred only in
Port-au-Prince and the suburban area where the Leopards Battalion
is based.
   The revolt gained strength after Avril deported three officers
accused of plotting the coup _ Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of
the Leopards; Presidential Guards commander Col. Philippe Biamby,
and Col. Leonce Qualo of army headquarters.
   The army communique broadcast Saturday blamed the attempted coup
on opponents of the government's campaign ``against drug
trafficking, contraband and corruption.'' It also said the revolt
was directed by Haitian exiles associated with ousted dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France in February 1986 during
violent demonstrations.
   Avril, 51, came to power last September in a coup by
noncommissioned officers that overthrew the military government led
by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. He has promised to hold free elections.

<HEAD>Gromyko's Memoirs Report Human Side of Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin was a harsh man of
few words, but he occasionally gave in to softer human emotions,
former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko said in an excerpt
from his memoirs published Sunday.
   The first of a series of excerpts from Gromyko's book,
``Memories,'' appeared in The Observer newspaper.
   An example Gromyko gives of Stalin's more human side was in his
relations with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt when they were
allies during World War II. Gromyko was ambassador to the United
States.
   During the February 1945 Yalta meeting between Stalin, Roosevelt
and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Roosevelt became ill
one day and the talks were suspended. The president, who was
crippled by polio at the age of 39, lived only two months after the
Yalta conference.
   Gromyko said he accompanied Stalin on a 20-minute visit to
Roosevelt, who was in bed in his room overlooking the Crimean Sea,
and they exchanged remarks about health and the weather and beauty
of the Soviet Crimea.
   ``The president was delighted to see us. ... He was clearly
tired and drained though he tried not to show it,'' Gromyko wrote.
   ``We were descending the narrow staircase when Stalin suddenly
stopped, took his pipe out of his pocket, filled it unhurriedly
and, as if to himself, said quietly... `Why did nature have to
punish him so? Is he worse than other people?'
   ``Despite his basic harshness of character, Stalin did just
occasionally give way to positive human emotions,'' Gromyko said.
   Describing Stalin's manner, he said, ``I was always aware,
watching Stalin speaking, of how expressive his face was,
especially his eyes. When rebuking or arguing with someone, Stalin
had a way of staring him mercilessly in the eyes and not taking his
gaze off him. The object of this relentless stare, one has to
admit, felt profoundly uncomfortable.''
   ``He spoke quietly, evenly, almost as if muffled, and raised his
voice rarely. Even so, whenever he spoke there was total silence,
however many people were there,'' Gromyko said.

<TEXT>
   The paralyzed son of underworld financial wizard
Meyer Lansky sits destitute in a county convalescent home, despite
a deathbed promise by his father that he would be cared for.
   ``I'm sure my father would be turning over in his grave,''
Bernard ``Buddy'' Lansky, 59, said last week.
   In 1982, the year before Meyer Lansky died, Forbes magazine
called him one of the richest men in America, estimating his wealth
at $100 million. Other estimates put it at $300 million.
   Whatever Lansky's assets, his son was not privy to them. ``Dad's
dealings were all in cash. The only checks he ever wrote were for
rent.
   ``Where did the money go? That's what everybody wants to know.''
   Only a few weeks ago, Buddy Lansky's stepmother, Thelmy
``Teddy'' Schwartz Lansky, 81, told CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' that
stories of her husband's $300 million fortune were ``preposterous
and ridiculous.''
   She visits her stepson once a week at the Dade County
convalescent home where he shares an austere room with an elderly
man who doesn't talk. Although Lansky hasn't taken a step in seven
years, his black leather shoes are crumpled and torn.
   ``I never asked my stepmother for help,'' Lansky said last week.
``I felt if she wanted to do something, she would offer. It's not
like she doesn't know the circumstances.''
   For years, Meyer Lansky spoke hardly at all about his son's
cerebral palsy, an incurable disease caused by brain damage at
birth.
   Buddy knew little of his father, the undisputed patriarch of
organized crime, until he was 19 and saw his father's picture on
the front page of The New York Sun.
   The disease crippled Buddy Lansky gradually over the years,
forcing him to quit a job as a switchboard operator at a motel in
Sunny Isles, just north of Miami Beach.
   Surgeons fused his vertebrae and he wore a metal brace attached
to his forehead, able to move only his eyes for 10 weeks. In a
wheelchair, he saw his father for the last time at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Miami Beach a week before Lansky died of cancer
at age 80 on Jan. 15, 1983.
   ``He told me I would be taken care of,'' Buddy Lansky said.
   Authorities believe that Lansky pioneered organized crime's
system of financial manipulation and concealment.
   But if Lansky had hidden millions in banks in Switzerland, a
will filed in Dade County gave no clue. It noted only an estate in
excess of $110,000.
   In a trust administered in the courtroom of Judge Francis
Christie, Lansky left his son 65 percent of the trust's income to
provide for ``medical care, comfortable maintenance and welfare.''
   Buddy Lansky said he never found out how much was in the trust
or where his money was coming from _ except for some royalties from
oil and gas leases in Michigan and Ohio that went dry.
   His mother, Anne Citron, died in 1984. In 1985, he found out
there wasn't enough money to pay his physical therapist, who was
owed $5,240.
   Lansky also discovered that he was three months behind in
payments to the nursing home in North Miami, owing nearly $5,000.
   Attorneys who had handled the trust declined comment, citing
client confidentiality.
   As Buddy Lansky's income dropped from $15,000 in 1985 to $5,300
in 1988, a few of his father's old friends stepped in to help.
   One was Yiddy Bloom, former owner of the Hawaiian Isle motel.
According to records, Bloom paid the nursing home a total of
$47,900 over a period of three years.
   But late last year, the money stopped and on Feb. 27 Buddy
Lansky had to move out. He moved to less expensive home, which
accepts Dade County patients. The county pays $50 a day for his
care.
   His only income is $564 a month from Social Security, which goes
directly to the nursing home.
   ``You can pick your friends,'' Lansky said, ``but you can't pick
your relatives.''

Texas A&amp;M spokesman saying he doesn't know amount of energy generated.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas A&amp;M University researchers have duplicated
a controversial University of Utah experiment that reportedly
achieved nuclear fusion using a relatively simple process, a
college spokesman said Sunday.
   Officials at the school in College Station said they would hold
a news conference Monday to announce that their researchers had
achieved the same kind of cold fusion, one of the most sought-after
scientific breakthroughs.
   ``Other labs around the country have been trying to duplicate
this, but nobody else has been able to get satisfactory results,''
said Ed Walraven, a spokesman for Texas A&amp;M. ``Our people are
convinced that they've got it, so as a gesture to the researchers
in Utah we wanted to announce it as soon as possible.''
   Scientists have long sought the secrets of nuclear fusion,
considered a possible replacement for conventional energy sources
because it would be clean, inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable.
   Researchers in Utah announced March 23 that they had achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature. Their claim has been met with
widespread skepticism among colleagues.
   Other researchers have complained that they tried to replicate
the experiment of Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and his
British colleague, Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southhampton, but without success.
   Pons has said he wasn't surprised at his colleagues'
difficulties because the experiment is more complicated than press
reports have made it out to be, and only recently have the
technical details reached the scientific community.
   Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah said recently
that he had achieved fusion in a similar experiment, but obtained
far less energy than Pons and Fleischmann said they obtained.
   The Texas A&amp;M spokesman said he did not have any details on the
amount of the amount of energy generated in that university's
experiment.
   Fusion, the energy source that powers the sun and hydogen bombs,
is achieved by joining atoms, usually through the application of
millions of degrees of heat. Fission, the energy source for nuclear
power plants, comes from splitting atoms. Fusion generates far less
waste than fission.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they produced fusion energy in a
6-inch glass jar at room temperature and normal pressure. They said
the experiment generated four times as much energy as it used.
   The Utah Legislature on Friday approved $5 million for further
fusion research. But lawmakers said no money would be spent unless
the experiment is confirmed.

   Hired gunmen killed three
people Sunday in separate shootings linked to mob feuds and
vendettas, police reported.
   They said a fourth person was killed late Saturday.
   Police said the killings occurred within 12 hours and raised the
murder toll this year to 49 in Calabria, Italy's southern province.
   Investigators attributed the four killings to the Calabrian
Mafia, known as the N'drangheta.
   Police identified the victims as Giuseppe Arecchi, 27, Romeo
Marvaso, 38, Vincenzo Calabro, 30, and Annunziato Rizzo, 51.

   Arsonists torched one Florida women's clinic and
may have been responsible for a fire at another early Sunday on the
eve of a huge abortion-rights march in Washington, authorities said.
   Deborah Struthers, president of the All Woman's Health Center in
Ocala and the Fort Myers Woman's Health Center, said both places
were hit at about the same time. Fort Myers is on Florida's
southwest coast. Ocala lies about 150 miles to the north.
   ``I don't understand the mentality of someone who would do
something like this _ these are terrorists we're dealing with
here,'' Ms. Struthers said. ``But it doesn't matter what they do,
we are not going to stop providing these services.''
   The Ocala fire was the second in less than 10 days. Someone
tried to burn the clinic down early Mar. 31. Officials said
Sunday's blaze looked like the work of the same arsonist.
   Information was scarce on the Fort Myers fire, which was
reported about 3:30 a.m. Sgt. Ed Stone of the Lee County Sheriff's
Department said authorities were still looking into its cause
Sunday afternoon.
   About a half hour after firefighters got that call, a neighbor
spotted the flames in Ocala and called firefighters. According to
fire department spokesman Barry Britton, they responded quickly,
but the entire clinic already was burning.
   ``At this point you have the four exterior walls standing,'' he
said. ``The roof is burnt off it and the interior is totally
gutted.''
   A police spokesman said investigators have some leads.
   ``There are some possiblities, but nothing we can hang our hats
on,'' said Sgt. Ken Hall of the Ocala police department.
   Ms. Struthers said it was because she had anticipated trouble
that she stayed home from the Washington rally, at which hundreds
of thousands of abortion rights activists marched from the
Washington Monument to the Capitol.
   ``I just didn't prepare well enough,'' she added. ``It just
never dawned on us that someone would be that disturbed and
unstable and aggressive and vicious.''
   Ms. Struthers said she had no estimate of damage to the Fort
Myers clinic, but said it would not open Monday.
   ``It appears to be pretty well gutted out,'' Stone said.
   In addition to local authorities, agents of the state fire
marshal's office are working on both fires. The federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was also called in, Britton said.
   Stone said that agency would probably look into the Fort Myers
incident as well.
   Ocala anti-abortion activists say they're not responsible for
the fires.
   ``People in my group had speculated (about) the possibility of
the abortionists doing it themselves,'' said Ed Martin, president
of Marion County Right to Life.
   He said they would have done it to draw attention to their cause
and damage the anti-abortion movement.
   ``The only way that this can be calmed down is for something
like this to happen where a clinic goes up and it puts a bad light
on our movement,'' he said.
   Ms. Struthers said that's ``absurd.''
   ``In Ocala, the anti-choice people have been very vocal and
quite aggressive in their actions,'' she said. ``I wouldn't say
that those are the people responsible. I wouldn't like to point
fingers but we have had some of the most aggressive picketing in
the state.''
   She said the violent tactics wouldn't keep her organziation from
its work.
   ``What these people don't realize is that it reaffirms our
commitment to this. It doesn't make us think `This is too much
trouble and we'll just go away.' It makes us stronger.''

<TEXT>
   An Israeli naval patrol off the coast of
Lebanon opened fire Sunday on a rubber dinghy carrying two
Palestinian guerrillas toward Israel and destroyed the vessel, the
navy commander announced.
   In Sidon, Lebanon, a Libyan-sponsored Palestinian faction also
reported the encounter but said there were four guerrillas aboard
the dinghy, including one woman. It made no mention of casualties.
   Maj. Gen. Micha Ram, the navy chief, said the Israeli boat Dvora
was on routine patrol when the dinghy was seen just north of the
Israeli border town Rosh Haniqra.
   Israel television interviewed the commander of the Dvora but did
not identify him by name.
   ``I spotted ... a rubber dinghy with two people and I was
certain of two things,'' the commander said in the television
interview. ``It was headed for the border and the men inside were
wearing green uniforms.''
   ``It was clear they were terrorists,'' he said, adding that he
could not identify them further.
   The commander said his boat fired flares and pursued the dinghy
for a short time before approaching and shooting. ``We opened fire
and in a matter of seconds the boat sank,'' he said.
   Ram said the patrol boat did not stay in the area to search for
survivors so ``as not to endanger the Dvora.'' The military said
Israeli forces suffered no casualties.
   The Palestine Popular Struggle Front said in a statement issued
in the southern port city of Sidon that the dinghy was intercepted
off Ras el-Bayyada, six miles north of the Israeli border.
   It said four guerrillas ``were on their way to our Palestinian
coast in a rubber dinghy.
   ``Our guerrillas fired rockets at the Israeli enemy boats. The
enemy used all kinds of weapons in the clash and dropped flares
that lit the whole area,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate
and a second statement said only that one of the guerrillas was a
woman.
   The Popular Struggle Front is based in Syria and is opposed to
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat's recent
conciliatory moves toward Israel.
   Washington has expressed concern over recent infiltration
attempts by guerrillas from Lebanon. Arafat and his aides have said
the PLO's renunciation of terrorism does not mean a halt to
guerrilla operations against Israeli military targets.
   Also Sunday, an Israeli soldier suffered light wounds when an
armored personnel carrier hit a land mine in southern Lebanon, the
Israeli military command said.
   The incident occurred in Israel's self-declared security zone in
Lebanon.
   Israel carved out the zone in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of
its troops from Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation of the
southern part of the country.

   John T. Dorrance Jr., whose family founded
Campbell Soup Co. and who later became its chairman and one of the
nation's wealthiest men, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack.
He was 70.
   Dorrance joined Campbell, which was founded by his great uncle,
in 1946 after several years in the Army during World War II.
   He spent 16 years working in various departments of the company,
including a stint as a floor foreman in the Camden plant.
   Dorrance oversaw Campbell's expansion into the Swanson line of
frozen dinners and its Pepperidge Farm baked goods.
   He was elected to Campbell's board of directors in 1947 and
chairman of the board in 1962. He retired in 1984 and was elected
chairman of the board's executive committee.
   Last year, Forbes magazine estimated his worth at over $1.2
billion.
   Dorrance, who lived in Gladwyne, Pa., is survived by his wife,
Diana, and three children: John, also a Campbell board member, of

   British comedian Terry-Thomas, who has appeared in
more 40 films, was honored Sunday night at a charity gala to raise
money for treatment of the Parkinson's disease he suffers from.
   ``Never in my history in show business has there been anything
as big as this,'' said Jack Douglas, the British actor who
organized the sold-out event with journalist Richard Hope-Hawkins.
   Terry-Thomas, 77, has suffered from the degenerative muscle
disease for a decade and was too ill to attend.
   The comedian with the famous gap-toothed smile was represented
by his two children, Tiger and Cushan, Douglas said in an interview.
   The five-hour show at the 2,652-seat Theater Royal featured
performances by singers Phil Collins and Eartha Kitt, among others.
The audience also heard tape-recorded tributes to Terry-Thomas from
celebrities in Los Angeles including Dudley Moore, Mickey Rooney
and Lynn Redgrave.
   Douglas said the show raised about $106,000. He said that about
$50,000 will go into a trust for Terry-Thomas, the stage name of
the actor born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens.
   The rest of the proceeds will be divided between the
London-based Parkinson's Disease Society and the Entertainment
Artist's Benevolent Fund, Douglas said.
   He said the show was videotaped so Terry-Thomas and his wife,
Belinda, could watch it later this week at their home in Barnes,
southwest London.
   Douglas described himself as an admirer and a fan of
Terry-Thomas, whom he first saw in a 1946 London stage variety show.
   Terry-Thomas' films include ``I'm All Right, Jack,'' ``It's A
Mad Mad Mad Mad World'' and ``Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying
Machines.''
   Douglas and Terry-Thomas appeared together in the 1959 film
``Carlton-Browne of the F.O.,'' known in the United States as ``Man
In A Cocked Hat.''
   But Douglas he said he only got to know Terry-Thomas when he
started to organize the gala three months ago.
   ``When I looked at Terry in his very bare apartment, his food
paid for by the Entertainment Artist's Benevolent Fund, I thought,
`There but for the grace of God go any of us,''' Douglas said.
   Douglas acknowledged that the high cost of specialized health
care could quickly eat away the money raised by the benefit, even
though Britain's system of socialized medicine keeps costs somewhat
in check.
   ``If this isn't (enough money), we'll do another show next
year,'' Douglas said.

   Former Paraguayan dictator Alfredo
Strossner was hospitalized Sunday with congestive heart failure, a
doctor said.
   A doctor at the Heart Institute said Stroessner has had a mild
form of congestive heart failure for many years and the condition
was not severe. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 76-year-old Stroessner was ousted in a violent coup Feb. 5
and since has been living in exile in Guaratuba, an Atlantic resort
about 260 miles east of Sao Paulo.
   The doctor said Stroessner underwent several tests Sunday and
will undergo more on Monday.
   Paraguay's foreign minister, Luis Maria Argana, said last week
that his government, acting for ``humanitarian reasons,'' was
looking for a country with advanced medical facilities to treat
Stroessner's prostate cancer.
   He said the United States had refused to grant Stroessner a
temporary visa to receive treatment.

   Prosecutors searched the offices of
a West German company in an investigation into exports of rocket
technology to Iraq, a news magazine reported Sunday.
   The Hamburg-based Stern magazine said prosecutors on Friday
seized documents during a search of the MBB-Transtechnica company
offices in Munich. The company is a subsidiary of the aerospace and
armament giant Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm, according to the
magazine.
   A British television report to be aired Monday makes similar
claims, according to a news release issued by the British Broadcast
Corp. The report will be shown on ``Panorama,'' the BBC's most
respected current affairs show.
   Stern said in a statement that its report will appear in the
magazine's Thursday edition.
   It said Friday's search was related to an investigation into
another West German company, Gildemeister Projecta. The magazine
said that company was the general contractor for a ``secret rocket
development laboratory in Iraq disguised as a civilian university
institute.''
   Stern said Gildemeister's offices in Bielefeld were searched
three weeks ago.
   The searches apparently were linked to a government announcement
that it would tighten export regulations, which came under attack
by U.S. authorities earlier this year. U.S. officials accused Libya
of building a chemical weapons factory and said West German firms
were involved in the construction.
   The prosecutor's office in Munich was closed on Sunday and
officials could not be reached for comment.
   In several recent reports Stern said West German companies were
involved in exporting technology used in the development of a
Condor 2 rocket, with the capability of carrying a nuclear warhead.
Stern said the rocket has a 620-mile range.
   According to the magazine, MBB-Transtechnica pulled out of
weapons development projects in Egypt and Argentina following
pressure from the West German and U.S. governments. But it said MBB
continues to deliver technology to Iraq.
   Last week the firm delivered equipment to Iraq that can be used
to measure missile trajectories, Stern said. It quoted company
officials as saying all deliveries were legal and received the
required government export permits.
   Stern said the federal Economics Ministry withdrew previously
approved export permits for Gildemeister on grounds that federal
officials were not told the real nature of the project in Iraq.
   The magazine said it also had documents that showed Gildemeister
had exported electronic components, developed by a U.S. company,
for the Iraqi project.

   Several hundred residents of a drug-torn
neighborhood marched through the streets Sunday in an anti-crack
protest fueled by weekend shootings that left two dead and 10
injured in another part of the city.
   ``We are going to march and shout and sing and pray till this
crack cocaine is completely eradicated from our community,'' said
the Rev. Cecil Williams, who led the march through the Ocean View
neighborhood.
   Although the march and rally had been planned for several weeks,
a drive-by ambush and another shooting less than two miles away in
the Bayview-Hunters Point district gave people another reason to
participate, Williams said.
   ``People are being killed, being openly killed,'' said Williams,
pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.
   Community and religious leaders in Bayview-Hunters Point had
urged their own residents to march in protest of the shootings in
the neighborhood hard hit by gang violence.
   ``It's getting to be summertime, it's hot, and if we don't look
at this problem aggressively, we're going to have a long, hot
summer,'' warned Joseph Landry, chairman of the Bayview-Hunters
Point Crime Abatement Committee.
   The neighborhood was the scene early Saturday of the worst mass
shooting in San Francisco since five people were killed and 11
wounded in the 1975 Golden Dragon Massace in Chinatown.
   Two people were killed and nine injured in the automatic weapon
ambush, which police said may have been a case of mistaken
identity. One remained in serious condition Sunday at Mission
Emergency Hospital.
   In a second incident Saturday night, two men were abducted by
four others carrying an Uzi machine gun and a .45-caliber handgun.
One of the abducted men was shot. He was in stable condition Sunday
at Mission Emergency.
   ``This type of action is not uncommon for gangs,'' said police
officer Jerry Langford.
   Police have beefed up patrols in the neighborhood and asked for
anyone with information about the shootings to come forward, but
residents were uneasy.
   ``It's unreal,'' said JoAnne Miller, a member of the San
Francisco School board and a neighbor and acquaintance of one of
the slain. ``Everybody's scared now. It was never like this.''

<HEAD>Nine Suicides Prompt Review at Mental Health Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national accreditation group has begun an
investigation into the suicides of nine patients in 18 months at
the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex, officials say.
   The deaths occurred between May 1987 and last October, raising
questions about the level of care at the facility. However, the
center's acting administrator, Jon E. Gudeman, insisted that his
staff wasn't responsible for the deaths.
   After the situation was reported by an advocacy group for the
mentally ill, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations in Chicago requested records on the suicides and
asked what corrective steps had been taken.
   The deaths included four patients who hanged themselves, one who
suffocated with a plastic bag, one who took an overdose of
anti-depressant, one who jumped through a window to his death, one
who killed himself by carbon monoxide poisoning and one who drowned
in Lake Michigan.
   Gudeman said he provided the information but hasn't received a
reply. He told an interviewer last week that hospitalization
reduces the risk of suicide but ``doesn't totally eliminate it.''
   He said a 1980 study of six mental hospitals in New York City
estimated there were 1.3 to 2.5 inpatient suicides for every 1,000
patients. Even in 1987 and 1988, the Milwaukee figures were within
that range, he said.
   ``In my belief, they received good and proper care,'' Gudeman
said of the suicide victims.
   However, Thomas E. Dixon, an attorney for the Wisconsin
Coalition for Advocacy in Madison, called the number of suicides
among the patients at the complex ``an outrage.''
   ``Something is missing,'' he said. ``It may be the level of
staffing, the training of the staff, the supervision of the
patients. Something is missing, though we don't have any way of
knowing exactly what it is.''
   Gudeman said he has made policy changes in response to the
suicides. Some were prompted by an inspection by the state Division
of Health that found five deficiencies in the care of a 20-year-old
man who suffocated himself with a plastic trash can liner.
   ``This man was talking about killing himself and how he was
going to do it, and he was not put on suicidal precautions,'' said
Vicki Lauridsen, a state investigator. ``And that to us was rather
negligent.
   ``The staff did not respond in a normal fashion,'' she said.
``They did not take this person seriously. They goofed.''
   Gudeman said changes at the complex include more one-on-one
observations of patients by a staff member, in-service training on
care of suicidal patients and increased clinical reviews of patient
charts.

<HEAD>Government to Probe Claims of Lax Security at Pan Am</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Transport Secretary Paul Channon on Sunday
ordered an urgent inquiry into a newspaper's claim of security
lapses on Pan Am airliners at London's Heathrow airport, his office
said.
   ``The Secretary has ordered an inquiry. He has asked for an
urgent report from Pan Am on the matter,'' said a department
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Monday's editions of The Sun tabloid carried an account by a
reporter who said he worked undercover for two weeks in a baggage
handling job at Pan Am and noted repeated security breaches.
   The reporter, George Pascoe-Watson, applied for the job using
the fictitious name George Watson two weeks after 270 people died
in the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Soctland.
   He was hired three months later even though he lied about
previous jobs and gave the names of two friends as sponsors, he
said.
   Pascoe-Watson said that on one occasion more than 50 pieces of
luggage for Flight 103 to New York passed through an X-ray scanner,
but the Pan Am security guard glanced at the video screen only
seven times.
   He also said he was allowed to wander unsupervised through
restricted areas at Heathrow despite security rules that new staff
must be escorted.
   ``Just hours after starting work on my first day I was left
unsupervised and unchecked to pack the Israeli soccer team's
luggage on to a Qantas 747 bound for Melbourne,'' Pascoe-Watson
said.
   Pan Am denied the charge that the reporter was unsupervised.
   Peter Joel, the airline's spokesman in London, said: ``We
believe it is premature for the Department of Transport to accept
that a breach of security has occurred based solely on the
allegations of The Sun and before investigations are completed.''
   A Heathrow airport official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said: ``At no time did Mr. Pascoe-Watson constitute a security risk
and his temporary pass allowing access under escort was issued in
the proper manner.''
   After the Lockerbie crash, reporters from three British
newspapers described how they were allowed to wander through the
airport and board airliners unchallenged.
   British and U.S. authorities have been criticized for not
issuing public warnings after they received anonymous threats
against Pan Am airliners before the bombing occurred.

   Hundreds of abortion rights activists who couldn't join the
hundreds of thousands at Sunday's march in Washington held rallies
of their own in cities around the country.
   Slogans and chants heard in the nation's Capitol were also
shouted in Kansas City, Mo., Topeka, Kan., Montgomery, Ala., Omaha,
Neb., and Portland, Ore., as demonstrators asserted their right to
legal abortions.
   Many carried or wore twisted coat hangers, macabre symbols of
the back-alley abortions that the demonstrators fear would return
if the Supreme Court overturns its landmark abortion case, Roe vs.
Wade.
   ``I hate abortion, I think it's horrendous,'' said Lynda Herring
of Kansas City, one of 1,200 people who rallied in a park there to
show support for legal abortion. ``I hope I never have to make the
choice. But if I do, I hope I have the right to make the choice.''
   ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, patriarchy has got to go,'' women chanted in
Portland, where 800 people turned out at a downtown park.
   In Montgomery, about 100 demonstrators marched to the Dexter
Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. once was the pastor.
   Elsewhere in Alabama, about 600 people attended an anti-abortion
rally in Florence and about 20 pro-choice supporters gathered at a
Huntsville clinic.
   `We believe abortion is wrong,'' said Stan McDonald, state
director of Youth Affairs. ``We believe abortion is murder. Did you
know that the most dangerous place you can live in America is in
the womb?''
   A handful of anti-abortion activists also registered opposition
in Montgomery, Kansas City and Portland, but the rallies were
peaceful and no arrests were reported.
   About 500 abortion rights supporters rallied in Omaha, and about
100 in Topeka.

   Soldiers charged thousands of protesters in the
Georgian capital early Sunday, and at least 16 people were killed
in a crushing melee of clubs, shovels, sticks and stones, official
sources and activists said.
   ``They threw themselves on our people like beasts, and our
people couldn't do anything,'' said Leda Archvadze in a telephone
interview from Tbilisi, capital of the southern republic that lies
on the Turkish border.
   The official Tass news agency said a curfew was in effect Sunday
night. Residents flew black flags of mourning, troops and tanks
reportedly patrolled the streets, and activists called for a
general strike.
   One activist said 50 people died in the clash in Lenin Square.
   Tension has been building in Georgia since Tuesday, when
thousands of hunger strikers and protesters began pressing demands
for independence from the Soviet Union. Georgian nationalists
contend that under Moscow's central control, Russians have
encroached on their culture, language, politics and economy.
   They also accuse the Kremlin of fomenting unrest among Georgia's
ethnic Abkhazians, who are demanding more autonomy.
   Georgia is the third Soviet republic where authorities have
brought in troops and tanks to quell disturbances in the past year.
Similar measures were taken to quell ethnic unrest last year in the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   In an attempt to prevent future unrest, the Soviet Presidium on
Saturday passed a decree making it illegal to insult or discredit
the government. It also mandated fines and prison terms for those
who call for the overthrow of the government, among other things.
   On Sunday, authorities imposed an 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and
banned public gatherings to end the protests, said Zurab
Zhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group in Tbilisi. He
said the demonstrators went home when the curfew took effect and
streets were deserted except for patrolling troops and tanks.
   Ms. Archvadze and another activist estimated 10,000 people were
in Lenin Square when soldiers moved in at 3 a.m.
   She said said her information came from her brother-in-law,
Svyad Gammsachurdia, also a member of the Watch Committee, who
witnessed the clash. He was arrested at his home several hours
later, she said.
   Tass said local officials ordered troops to clear the square
after protest organizers ``began to declare plans to seize power.''
   ``They kindled inter-ethnic strife and called for the
elimination of Soviet power in Georgia, the creation of a
provisional government of the republic and its withdrawal from the
U.S.S.R.,'' Tass said.
   The Interior Ministry said troops and soldiers followed orders
not to use weapons, ``but some extremists armed with rocks, sticks
and metal objects offered fierce resistance,'' Tass said. ``Their
actions caused a crush in the crowd and as a result, 16 people
died.''
   Georgian television reported at least 100 people were injured,
said a duty officer at the city executive committee.
   Tass said the injured included 75 soldiers and policemen.
   Zhankarashvili said tanks and busloads of soldiers appeared
suddenly and attacked the crowd with clubs and small shovels.
Youths in the crowd used stones, flagpoles and whatever they could
find to fight back, he said.
   A handful of Georgian policemen on the scene defended the
protesters against the Soviet troops, Zhankarashvili said. He said
50 people died and 500 were injured.
   The Popular Front of Georgia is calling for a general strike on
Monday to protest the killings, Zhankarashvili said, ``because it's
not possible to organize demonstrations and this is the only form
of protest we have left.''
   Unofficial sources said many soldiers and tanks were still in
the streets, and there were reports more were arriving in the city
of 1.2 million, about 1,100 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Authorities detained at least five activists, their relatives
said. The five were among the leaders of the pro-independence
rallies and were identified as Gammsachurdia; Georgy Chanturia,
chairman of the National Democratic Party of Georgia, which started
the hunger strike; Irina Sarishvili, a spokeswoman for that group;
and Mirab Kostava and Irakly Batryashvili.
   The protests were planned to lead up to the 11th anniversary of
a 1978 protest that succeeded in destroying plans to drop Georgian
as the republic's official language.
   No violence was reported in Tbilisi before Friday. But some
violence was reported in outlying areas last week between
Abkhazians and Georgians.
   Many of the nations more than 100 ethnic groups have taken
advantage of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or openness, to demand greater autonomy in cultural, economic and
political affairs.

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Vow to Oppose Equal Rights Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's justice minister on Sunday proposed
action on a civil rights law that is denounced by religious leaders
who say it does not recognize the special nature of Judaism in the
state.
   The proposed ``Basic Law on Human Rights'' was first introduced
in 1965.
   It calls for equality ``between men and women and all people
regardless of religion, nationality, race, or ethnicity.'' It would
not apply in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip, captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war, which are ruled through military
and not civil law.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor said he was concerned that civil
liberties had been put aside in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``When a nation is struggling, people start to think what does
it matter what an individual says, or what peoples' rights are,''
Meridor told Israel radio. ``I think the time has come to set
matters straight.''
   Israel has no constitution and the Supreme Court cannot declare
parliamentary legislation illegal. Civil rights come from a mixture
of parliamentary laws and Supreme Court decisions.
   But if approved, the proposed measure gives the Supreme Court
authority to reject laws that violate civil rights. Meridor said
Jewish religious courts would retain their exclusive authority to
conduct marriages and divorces.
   The bill was accepted by the Cabinet and referred to a special
committee.
   At Sunday's Cabinet meeting Minister of Religious Affairs Avner
Shaki vowed to oppose the bill.
   ``I told Meridor that the state is first a Jewish state and then
a democratic and humanitarian state,'' he said. ``After all Judaism
includes these concepts.''
   In a debate on television, Shaki said he will not accept the
bill unless it states that man was ``created by God in his image''
and that Israel is a Jewish state.
   ``We will never agree to this,'' said Shulamit Aloni, leader of
the liberal Citizens Rights Movement. ``It's like calling South
Africa a white state.''

   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen Monday
morning, while stock prices dropped sharply after early morning
gains on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 132.78 yen, and moved in a range of
132.52-132.78. It stood at 132.67, up 0.59 yen from last Friday's
close of 132.08 yen at mid-morning.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 189.27-point
gainer last Friday, lost 266.74 points, or 0.81 percent, to finish
the morning trading at 32,918.31.
   Currency dealers said they expect no major shifts Monday because
of players' caution about possible intervention by central banks.
   The dollar's higher opening compared to its finish at 132.75 yen
in New York last Friday. The Tokyo market customarily follows the
trend of the New York market in the absence of major
market-affecting news.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index opened firm, reflecting
stable exchange rates and the strong showings of the New York and
other stock markets last week.
   The main index, however, declined sharply in late morning
trading because of market anxiety about an unstable domestic
political situation.
   It was learned last week that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
was closely linked to the controversial firm at the center of a
major bribery scandal. Members of his own party have called for his
resignation.
   Prosecutors are reportedly preparing to question high-ranking
politicians linked to the affair.

   Intel Corp. strikes back at Motorola Inc. on
Monday by unveiling its 80486 computer chip, the latest weapon in
an epic battle between the Coke and Pepsi of microprocessor makers.
   The announcement scheduled for the Comdex trade show in Chicago
comes less than two weeks after Motorola gave some early
information about its own new chip, the 68040.
   Each chip will have 1 million or more electronic devices packed
onto a fingernail of silicon, a density equivalent to two-lane
roads blanketing all of California, Arizona and Nevada.
   The race between Intel and Motorola is producing chips that are
so advanced there will not be software that exploits their full
capabilities for years.
   ``It's a testament to human ingenuity that we can even make
these, even think of it,'' said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI
Research Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
   The leapfrogging has lifted the two U.S. companies far ahead of
any other competitors _ American, European or Japanese.
   Each garnered about $475 million last year from sales of 32-bit
chips, followed distantly by National Semiconductor Corp. with $50
million, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp. of
Scottsdale, Ariz.
   All other companies combined sold $100 million worth, the
research firm said.
   A 32-bit chip handles instructions that contain information in
chunks of 32 bits. A bit is a zero or a one, the smallest units of
information used in a computer.
   Now there are signs that Intel is pulling ahead. Motorola used
to have a substantial lead in 32-bit chips because it sold most of
the ones that were used in technical workstations and non-computer
equipment, such as phone switches. Apple Computer Inc. also uses
Motorola chips.
   Intel's biggest market, meanwhile, has been IBM-compatible
personal computers ever since International Business Machines Corp.
picked Intel's 8088 for its original PC in 1981.
   The new Intel 80486 is the natural successor for PCs made by IBM
as well as Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy Corp. and the rest. But
Intel, not satisfied, is staging an assault on Motorola's
workstation market with the 80486 and the recently announced i860,
another 32-bit processor.
   ``Motorola has by far the most serious competition they've ever
had for that technical workstation market,'' from Intel and a host
of smaller companies, said Michael Slater, editor and publisher of
Microprocessor Report in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Japanese companies make most of the simple microprocessors that
go into consumer products such as videocassette recorders and
microwave ovens. They also dominate the world market for memory
chips, where manufacturing skill is the critical factor.
   American companies, though, dominate in top-of-the-line
microprocessors, which have all the computing power of the
mainframe computers of less than a decade ago. That's partly
because they have customers locked into their designs.
   It's also partly because Americans are still better at complex
design work. Microprocessors require it, while memory chips don't
so much.
   ``It's like the difference between writing a novel and writing a
dictionary. In a novel, everything has to work together and it has
to flow,'' Hutcheson said.
   New microprocessors have come along so frequently that software
writers never even got a chance to develop programs that took
advantage of the features of Intel's 80286, which came out in 1982.
Instead, they jumped straight to writing for the 80386, which came
out in 1985.
   Programs that use some 80386 features are just beginning to
reach the market. Fortunately, the 80486 is similar enough that it
will be easy to upgrade programs to take advantage of its special
features.
   Volume production of the 80486 is expected to begin in early
1990, and personal computers built around it will be out at the
same time.
   For users, the new computers will mean colorful, life-like
graphics, more user-friendliness, faster calculations and the
ability to do several tasks at once, such as writing a memo while
in the background the machine is recalculating a spreadsheet and
printing out a graph on a laser printer.
   The software to do all that is taking time, but ``the momentum
is absolutely there,'' said Michael Swavely, vice president for
marketing at Compaq.
   The immense power of the new chips is turning engineers,
lawyers, accountants and others into do-it-yourselfers when it
comes to processing information. That is changing the nature of
business.
   ``You can say one thing for sure, you'll never be chained to the
MIS (mainframe computer) department again, waiting for them to
grace you with the report you need,'' said Mel Phelps, an analyst
at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Milken Friends Pledge Campaign Against Charges; Drexel Shows Sympathy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and colleagues of Michael Milken are
pledging to mount a public campaign against government charges that
the deposed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond mogul is a
criminal.
   Dozens of supporters _ many of whom refused to identify
themselves or even say whether they worked for Drexel _ attended
Milken's arraignment Friday in U.S. District Court on 98 counts of
racketeering and securities fraud.
   Another 90 corporate executives recently paid for a full-page ad
in The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal supporting
Milken. Its slogan, ``Mike Milken, We Believe in You,'' has been
emblazoned on baseball caps and T-shirts.
   ``We're going to turn this around,'' said Martin Klein, a New
York bankruptcy attorney and friend of Milken's, who attended the
hearing at which Milken pleaded innocent. ``It's manifestly unfair.
It'll be a test of the government's tactics.''
   Milken, 42, is widely credited with reshaping corporate America
in the 1980s from his Beverly Hills, Calif., office through the
sale of high-yield junk bonds that allowed small- and medium-sized
companies to expand rapidly or take over much larger firms.
   His work helped catapult Drexel from a third-tier investment
house into the fifth-largest firm of its kind in the United States
since he moved the junk bond division to the West Coast in the
mid-1970s.
   He also is praised by clients and friends as a man concerned
with Third World debt and educational issues who donates to charity
much of his annual pay, which was in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   ``Mike has always performed according to the highest standards
of professionalism, honesty, integrity and ethical conduct,'' said
the pro-Milken ad.
   The ad was signed by presidents and chief executives from firms
including MCI Corp., Metromedia Co. and GAF Corp. Many of those
same names have been passed on to reporters by a public relations
firm Milken hired to speak for him.
   Milken has been a target of government prosecutors for more than
two years and was indicted March 29 for a series of alleged schemes
that purportedly defrauded clients, investors and the public by
violating securities laws.
   Supporters and defense lawyers claim Milken has been unfairly
persecuted in the government's crackdown on white-collar crime in
an attempt to nail the highest paid and one of the most prominent
figures on Wall Street.
   ``I think there's been enough publicity about the government
being so heavy-handed and the provenance of the leaks being so
clear that the view is it's high time this man had his day in
court,'' said Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman of Ingersoll
Publications Co. and a close friend of Milken's.
   Defense lawyers also charged that the government in its
indictment released Milken's earnings _ more than $1 billion in
four years _ to sully public opinion against Milken.
   ``It's a question on the minds of thousands of people, including
people who will be jurors in this case,'' said Milken attorney
Arthur L. Liman.
   The government reportedly has been upset by Drexel's statements
of support for Milken, whom prosecutors allege masterminded the six
felonies Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to in its record $650
million securities fraud settlement.
   After Milken's indictment, Drexel decried government ``leaks and
innuendos'' against him. Drexel said he was responsible for opening
``new capital markets to hundreds of companies and helping to
create hundreds of thousands of jobs.''
   And after Friday's arraignment, at which Milken was released
without bail pending the setting of a bond, Drexel distanced itself
from direct support for Milken but didn't oppose cheerleading by
others.
   ``Some individuals have chosen to express their support for Mike
at this very difficult and emotional time for him,'' a statement
said. `We understand their desire to express their feelings.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Bruce Baird denied reports that the government asked Drexel to bar
employees from staging a courthouse rally for Milken. Supporters
did gather in Beverly Hills, where Drexel was holding its annual
junk bond conference sans Milken.
   None of those attending the arraignment or cheering Milken as he
exited the courthouse afterward would say whether they worked for
Drexel.
   Despite Drexel's earlier support for Milken, it is expected by
prosecutors to state Milken caused the crimes cited in its plea
bargain, which has not yet taken effect.
   In addition, Drexel also has agreed to cooperate with the
government, and that might require the firm to provide evidence
against Milken. A separate settlement of civil charges against
Drexel reportedly bars Drexel employees from ever talking business
with Milken.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new publication designed for college women, In
View, is making its debut on campus this month, and its creators
say they intend to avoid the pitfalls that have recently doomed
several college magazines.
   The 20-page publication has been dubbed a newspaper by its
publisher, Whittle Communications LP, although it resembles some of
the magazines often stuffed in the Sunday newspaper.
   In View is to appear five times during the academic year, and is
being distributed free through school officials at more than 600
campuses at sites such as sorority houses and women's dorms and
athletic facilities.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., said it expects In View will
attract about 2 million readers.
   Maybelline Co., the cosmetics maker, is the sole advertiser in
the first two issues, placing multiple ads. Financial arrangements
were not disclosed.
   ``It's tough to reach college women with conventional
advertising,'' said Lewis Nolan, a spokesman for Memphis,
Tenn.-based Maybelline.
   ``They don't settle into the routine other poeople have of
watching TV at regular times of the day or reading the morning
newspaper or keeping up a subscription to a magazine,'' he said.
   But will they find time to read In View?
   Whittle, which has built itself into a $150 million-a-year
business by developing media vehicles that appeal to
narrowly-defined audiences such as mothers waiting in the doctor's
office or animal owners at the veterinarian, spent more than a year
interviewing college women and says the research has given it the
insight needs to succeed where others have failed.
   ``We found there is a need for information that college women
don't get from traditional magazines,'' said Jim Hilmer, a Whittle
division manager who oversaw development of In View. ``They wanted
straight talk on issues that they have trouble dealing with.''
   In the inaugural issue, In View's story, ``Am I My Sister's
Keeper,'' discusses how to decide what to do when a roommate shows
signs of having a drug problem, eating disorder or severe
depression. Others stories discussed how all-nighters affect your
health and what opportunities await psychology majors.
   Editor Mara Covell said what readers won't get are ``how-to
stories'' or tips on quick fixes for their lives or appearances.
``We are not talking down to them,'' she said.
   The college market has proven a tricky one for some major
publishers.
   Newsweek and McGraw-Hill Co. each discontinued magazines aimed
specifically at college students last year. Whittle itself dropped
its flagship Campus Voice magazine last year and now publishes
sponored posters under the Campus Voice name at colleges.
   Earlier this year, the California-based Alan Weston
Communications Inc. discontinued its three college magazines _
College Woman, Moving Up and Ampersand's Entertainment Guide.
Ampersand had been published since 1977 and was being mailed
directly with the other two magazines, one aimed at women and the
other at men, to a total of 1.2 million students.
   Larry Smuckler, president of Alan Weston, said his company gave
up on those magazines because of the volatility of ad spending
aimed at college students.
   He said some advertisers would spend a lot of money one year
reaching the college market, but abruptly change direction and try
something else the next.
   ``How can one operate a business on the basis of those kind of
decisions,'' he said.
   Smuckler's company is now creating publications under contract
for companies and produces a sponsored movie trailer for theaters.
   There have been some new efforts to reach the college market.
   American Express Co., for instance, recently developed a
lifestyle magazine that will be sent four times a year to
cardholders who are college students.
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, sent
a 44-page magazine it described as the college edition of its
National Business Employment Weekly to more than 1,000 schools in
February. The sole sponsor was American Honda Motor Co. Inc.
   Follett College Stores Inc. gave away a million copies of its
new publication, Great Opportunities, through its 280 college
bookstores in January.
   The 20-page publication, which is to be published each August
and January, contained 19 pages of promotional offers from
advertisers and a single page of tips on resumes and job interviews.
   Jim Baumann, vice president of advertising at Follett in
Elmhurst, Ill., said students are not very interested in getting
news-oriented publications tailored for them. ``Given their choice
or reading Newsweek or the campus Newsweek, they would choose the
real thing,'' he said.
   But he said they don't mind being singled out for special
treatment when it comes to offering bargains.

<HEAD>Company Hopes To Make Dent In Cable TV Market With ``Wireless'' Cable
TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE ZGANJAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALTA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greg Oswald figures he's got the answer when
it comes to breaking into the close-knit cable television industry:
take an old technology, but apply it in a new way.
   His company, Capital Wireless, has just begun broadcasting cable
programs to customers via a local transmitter in the Helderberg
Mountains, just southwest of Albany.
   The signals are transmitted through the air _ the way
conventional television and radio stations are _ avoiding the high
expense and regulatory restrictions of cable installation.
   Oswald believes his company will be able to make inroads in a
local market already littered with nine cable TV companies and give
an industry that's seen little competition a run for its money.
   ``It'll be hard to break in here,'' Oswald said. ``But if I can
make it here, I can make it anywhere.''
   Capital Wireless is one of only about dozen wireless cable
companies operating in the United States. The firm is headquartered
in Malta, about 30 miles from its satellite receiver in the
Helderbergs. Its signal can reach as far as 60 miles away.
   The company's receiver, or dish, takes in signals from more than
30 other satellites and transmits them to Capital Wireless
customers. An antenna placed on each customer's house collects the
signal, and converters near the antenna and on the television set
convert the signal so it can be received on the TV.
   ``Wireless is the purest form of transmission because it's
through the air,'' said Oswald, president of Capital Wireless.
   This means customers don't have to worry about service being
interrupted by downed cable lines. But it does mean that mountains,
tall buildings and even heavy foliage can block the signal. Experts
say that's a significant defect because it limits the product's
availability.
   Capital Wireless offers 21 channels _ including local stations,
superstations like WWOR in New York City and satellite networks
such as CNN and MTV _ along with a premium movie channel and the
Disney Channel.
   Oswald says the company has the potential to double the number
of channels it offers using a method developed by General Electric
Co. The method involves splitting each channel into two.
   Capital Wireless charges $13.50 a month for its basic service.
Premium channels cost an additional $10 a month.
   The average cost of basic cable service nationwide is $14.60 a
month and the average subscriber gets at least 35 channels,
according to John Wolf, director of the National Cable Television
Association in Washington.
   About 55 percent of people nationwide subscribe to cable
television, said William Finneran, chairman of the New York State
Commission on Cable TV. In New York state, that figure climbs to 61
percent, he said.
   ``Those are hard numbers to compete with,'' Finneran said. ``I
know of no success stories where wireless has appreciably captured
even a corner of a market where cable exists. But that's not to say
it can't happen.''
   Oswald is banking on that. And he thinks his ace in the hole is
a strong emphasis on customer service.
   ``You're not too conscientious when you're the only guy in
town,'' he said, referring to local cable operators. ``Sometimes
people get that feeling pretty quickly.''
   Oswald said his company, which began offering its service in
March, signed 50 customers and received 3,000 inquiries in its
first week. He estimates the firm will have 10,000 customers in 18
months.
   Oswald believes many of his new customers were cable subscribers
who jumped ship because of unresponsive cable operators.
   Cable operators realize this is an area they have neglected,
said officials with the Cable TV Association of New York.
   ``It's part of the growing pain we went through,'' said Richard
Alteri, the association's president. ``We have been going through
various stages. The stage we're at now is one where we are devoting
our energies toward increased customer service.''
   Whatever the outcome of the battle for cable subscribers,
customers likely will reap the rewards of competition: improved
products and service and competitive prices, Oswald said.
