   Opposition candidate Rafael
Leonardo Callejas took the lead Sunday in early returns as
Hondurans voted in the nation's third free presidential election of
the decade.
   Initial unofficial returns representing about 9 percent of the
precincts gave National Party candidate Callegas 89,360 votes to
79,445 for Carlos Flores, running for the governing Liberal Party.
The returns were broadcast by Honduran television.
   ``The people want to vote, and it makes me proud to be a
Honduran today,'' Callejas said shortly before the polls closed at
6 p.m.
   Surveys had indicated Callejas was a slight favorite.
   Election day was peaceful and officials placed the voter turnout
at about 85 percent. People went to the polls in flag-decked
trucks, buses and cars and on foot and horseback.
   Honduras is sandwiched between civil wars in El Salvador and
Nicaragua, and a formidable task for the new president will be how
to deal with thousands of Nicaraguan rebels living in border bases
in Honduras and a half million war refugees.
   Flores said in a radio interview before the vote tally began,
``We are very optimistic. We're getting a very good turnout among
our supporters.''
   Flores, 39, is publisher of La Tribuna, one of the nation's
leading newspapers, and was trained as an engineer at Louisiana
State University. His wife, Mary, is a U.S. citizen.
   Callejas, 46, comes from a landowning family and was trained as
an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University.
   If Callejas takes office for a four-year term Jan. 27, it will
mark the first transition of power to an opposition party since
1932. Sunday's was also the nation's third free presidential
election of the decade, after years of military-dominated rule.
   Both major candidates have relatively conservative economic
views and pro-U.S. foreign policies, although both also agree that
U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels should move out of Honduras.
However, neither has an idea for getting them to leave.
   Two other candidates, Enrique Aguilar Paz of the Social
Democrats and Efrain Diaz Arrivillaga of the Cristian Democrats,
had loyal but small followings.
   Also at stake were three vice presidential posts, a 128-seat
unicameral congress and 289 mayoralties. Voting was by party slate,
with no ticket splitting allowed.
   The major issue in the campaign was the bad economy and
unpopular incumbent President Jose Azcona Hoyo's weak Liberal
government. Azcona, elected in 1985, is barred by law from seeking
another term.
   Half a million refugees fleeing civil wars in neighboring El
Salvador and Nicaragua have sharpened economic problems that
include per capita income of only about $500 a year, high
unemployment and inflation, and little industry.
   More than 2.2 million people were registered, but voting was
concentrated at a few locations, and many in the countryside had to
travel more than 20 miles to cast ballots.
   Because turnout was considered vital in a nation where party
loyalty runs deep, the parties launched intense get-out-the-vote
efforts.
   Pickup trucks and leased buses sported blue flags for Callejas,
red for Flores. Both parties set up centers where voters could
report and be taken to the correct voting box.
   ``Some people can't read the room numbers,'' said Leila Martina
Vargas, a National Party pollworker guiding voters in Kennedy, a
poor district of the capital.
   At the University of Honduras, five miles east of the capital,
more than 31,000 people were scheduled to vote at 104 polling boxes.
   ``It's peaceful now. We'll see what it's like when we do the
count at six,'' joked Glenda Yolanda Molina Ortiz, a National Party
poll worker, drawing a laugh from other poll watchers.
   International observers said the biggest problem seen so far was
bureaucratic _ about 50,000 people were missing their registration
cards or had the wrong ones.
   Anti-fraud measures included glass boxes to prevent ballot
stuffing as well as a plan to count and report the vote quickly
using fax machines, to cut out the delays that might permit
fiddling with results.
   Wide coverage by the nation's aggressive radio and television
stations was also expected to reduce fraud.
   A military government fell in 1982, and Azcona was elected over
Callejas in 1985 under a now-discarded procedure that gave Azcona
victory even though he had 225,000 fewer votes.
   Azcona won because votes that went to three other Liberal
candidates were added to his column. This year, Flores beat three
challengers in a primary; Callejas faced no challenge.

<TEXT>
   Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec
opened unprecedented talks Sunday with opposition leaders in an
attempt to stem Czechoslovakia's mounting political crisis.
   Adamec met with playwright Vaclav Havel and eight other members
of the Civic Forum that has mobilized hundreds of thousands of
people in pro-democracy protests over the past week.
   It was the first time top government leaders of the Communist
regime have met with a delegation of dissidents. On Tuesday, Adamec
met with a group that included some opposition leaders.
   Havel presented opposition demands and the two sides agreed to
meet again Tuesday, government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said after
the one-hour talks.
   The opposition also demanded a parliamentary investigation of
the Nov. 17 police attack on peaceful demonstrators in downtown
Prague, complete press freedom and the release of more political
prisoners, Pavel said.
   Adamec planned to speak later Sunday to a mass rally by the
opposition, which drew half a million to a similar protest Saturday
in Prague.
   Sunday's discussions opened in a chandelier-lit salon at an
elegant Prague restaurant and ballroom complex. There was applause
as Adamec rose and shook hands with Havel across a table decorated
with a small red, white and blue Czechoslovak flag.
   Three other ministers and Bohuslav Kucera, head of the
Communist-allied Socialist Party that is now showing increasing
independence, joined Adamec on the government delegation.
   The Civic Forum delegation included prominent dissident Vaclav
Maly, a banned Roman Catholic priest; and two figures who played a
key mediation role over the past week, composer Mihal Kocab and
journalist Mihal Horacek.
   The meeting, preceded by a Civic Forum meeting with the official
Communist youth movement, was part of a frenzied attempt by
Communist authorities to deal with growing demands for democracy
and avert a two-hour general strike Monday.
   Havel said on Saturday that the general strike would go ahead as
planned. He described it as a national referendum on whether
one-party rule should continue in Czechoslovakia.
   Pavel quoted Adamec as saying the general strike ``is a reality
we can hardly change now,'' but appealed to all sides to avoid
confrontation.
   Havel's talks with Adamec seemed intended to clarify the
situation before the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee holds its second emergency session in three days later
Sunday.
   On Friday, at a marathon 16-hour session, the Central Committee
tried to stem the crisis by dumping party chief Milos Jakes and
other leaders associated with the hard-line policies pursued since
1968, when a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion crushed the Prague
Spring reforms.
   But the shake-up was poorly received by Czechoslovaks, who
rallied in the hundreds of thousands Saturday to press their
demands for genuine democracy.

<HEAD>Bomb Attacks Leave One Dead, Blackout in Several Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas exploded a series of
bombs in Santiago overnight and early Sunday, killing a 16-year-old
boy and blacking out several cities in central Chile, police
reported.
   A leftist urban guerrilla gang called the Manuel Rodriguez
Patriotic Front claimed responsibility for the attacks, which took
place on President Augusto Pinochet's 74th birthday.
   In the most serious incident, police said 16-year-old Pablo
Robles was killed by a bomb that exploded shortly before midnight
in La Obra, a small village in the Andes foothills 16 miles
southeast of Santiago.
   Police said the bomb was planted near a monument honoring five
Pinochet bodyguards who were killed three years ago in an attempt
on the president's life.
   Police said Robles was walking with a friend when the explosion
occurred. The friend was hospitalized in serious condition.
   Other bombs blew out at least two electricity towers near
Santiago, blacking out several cities in central Chile including
the capital, where 4.5 million people live.
   Most power was back Sunday.
   At dawn, a powerful bomb exploded at Radio Mineria, a private
station in Santiago, leaving one technician slightly wounded and
causing heavy damage.
   Hernani Banda, the station's manager, said the bomb caused
severe damage to several offices. Radio Mineria went off the air
for several minutes after the blast.
   During the blackout, unidentified gunmen in a speeding car
sprayed the main entrance to the government's television station
with submachine-gun fire, police said. No one was wounded.
   A spokesman for the guerrilla group, who identified himself as
Jorge Salas, phoned local newspapers and radio stations to claim
responsibility for the bombings. Salas' voice is familiar to
reporters because he has called in similar situations in the past.
   The Manuel Rodriguez Front is the main guerrilla group fighting
Pinochet's 16-year-old regime. It has claimed responsibility for a
number of attacks on military and government targets, including the
attempt on Pinochet's life in September 1986.
   In a referendum Oct. 5, 1988, Chileans rejected Pinochet's bid
to extend his authoritarian rule until 1997. The 72-year-old army
commander was the sole candidate offered by the military. The vote
cleared the way for an open presidential election in December.

<HEAD>Four of 13 Provinces Vote to Join Autonomous Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in four Moslem provinces
approved joining a new special region to enjoy self-rule, but nine
other provinces and nine cities overwhelmingly rejected the plan,
election officials said Sunday.
   The Commission on Elections certified results of a referendum
held Nov. 19 in which voters throughout the southern Philippines
decided whether to join an autonomous government created to meet
demands by 4 million Moslems for self-rule.
   President Corazon Aquino, who signed the congressionally
approved plan in August, hoped the formula would end the
20-year-old Moslem insurgency for a separate Islamic state. Moslem
rebels rejected the plan as inadequate.
   ``The four provinces will constitute the autonomous region in
Moslem Mindanao,'' Hilario Davide, chairman of the Commission on
Elections, told reporters after the count was completed.
   Critics have questioned whether the autonomous government will
be viable. The four scattered Moslem-dominated provinces that
approved the plan are among the most impoverished in the country,
with poor communication and transportation. They also are not
contiguous.
   The provinces of Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao are on the main
southern island of Mindanao. The other two, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, are
islands scattered to the southwest, 650 miles south of Manila.
   Davide avoided commenting on criticisms that the plan merely
would fence off a poor region. The question of viability, he said,
was for Mrs. Aquino and Congress.
   Among areas rejecting the plan, Basilan province and the cities
of Cotabato and Marawi all are Moslem-dominated. Cotabato is
Maguindanao's provincial capital and Marawi is the capital of Lanao
del Sur.
   In predominantly Christian areas, voters rejected the plan by
margins as great as 40-to-1.
   The final tally showed 55.31 percent of the 3.5 million voters
in the 13 provinces and nine cities voted in the referendum, with
72 percent rejecting the plan.
   Vicente Delima, executive director of the elections commission,
said some issues remain unsettled, such as where to put the
permanent seat of the regional government. The law creating the
region makes Cotabato City the temporary seat, but Cotabato voted
against joining the region.
   The number of assemblymen also is in question, Delima said. The
law provides for three assemblymen from each voting district, but
non-joiners Cotabato City and Marawi both are parts of provincial
districts.
   Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, the
main Islamic rebel faction, has said he would wage a ``holy war''
no matter how the vote turned out.
   Mrs. Aquino forged a cease-fire with the rebels in 1986. Peace
talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has held.
Talks broke down largely because Mrs. Aquino refused the front's
demands to declare all 13 provinces part of the autonomous region
without a referendum.

   Hundreds of riot police firing tear
gas stormed a college campus Sunday to block a rally by radical
students and workers seeking the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo. They arrested about 500 protesters.
   Police blocked minor protests at three colleges in the southern
cities of Pusan, Masan and Taegu, officials said. Students fought
police with firebombs and rocks after being blocked from marching
off the campuses, they said.
   Riot troopers in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets
stormed the campus of Yonsei University in Seoul just before
protesters were to start a rally organized by five radical groups.
About 2,000 troopers were deployed around the campus to block the
demonstration.
   They chased students across the campus, tearing down posters and
smashing loudspeakers, chairs and the podium for the rally. Police
banned the rally as a threat to public order, but 1,200 people
turned out anyway.
   Hundreds of masked students armed with firebombs and clubs
battled police for several hours after the troops attacked. Police
armored vans with tear gas launchers fired barrages of tear gas
bombs to drive protesters back.
   ``Let's unite to terminate the Roh Tae-woo regime!'' protesters
shouted.
   Police officials, who refused to be named, said about 500
protesters were arrested in Seoul, most as they headed to the
rally. The officials said most of the detainees would be released
after being questioned.
   Officers were seen beating and slapping a number of students
seized during fighting at Yonsei. Police said they had no word on
injuries.
   Hundreds of riot police guarded key government buildings in
downtown Seoul to prevent possible attacks by radicals. More than
200 ringed the U.S. Embassy.
   Radical groups had called for protests in an effort to revive
their flagging movement to topple the conservative government. But
the radicals lack public support because of their extremist views
and violent tactics.
   Radical groups want to overthrow the government and create a
``workers and farmers state.'' They also want immediate
reunification with Communist North Korea.
   The anti-American radicals also demand an end to close ties with
Washington and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty against North Korea.

   Waves of Cambodian guerrillas broke
through government positions on the outskirts of a strategic town
near the Thai border Sunday and took control of most of it, a
guerrilla commander said.
   At least 60 government soldiers and civilians in Svay Chek were
killed in the attack Sunday morning, said Gen. Pan Thai, chief of
staff of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   ``We control 70 percent of the town of Svay Chek right now,'' he
said at Prasat, a command post near the Thai border. ``We will for
sure take the whole town, probably tonight.''
   The guerrillas said they intercepted radio messages in which the
government defenders requested permission to withdraw at 11 a.m.,
six hours after the latest guerrilla assault, but were told to wait
for reinforcements.
   Thai military intelligence sources confirmed most of the
guerrilla claims.
   The guerrillas said a convoy of government tanks, trucks and
armored personnel carriers withdrew south toward Sisophon on Sunday
morning but halted after going about five miles.
   Sisophon, a government military operations center about 13 miles
south of Svay Chek, is the guerrillas' ultimate objective. Its
capture would be the biggest victory of the 11-year-old war against
the Vietnamese-installed government.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front and two other
guerrilla groups allied with it are supplied by China and other
countries. The government is armed mainly by the Soviet Union.
   Guerrillas of the front captured areas north of Svay Chek in
late September, only days after Vietnam claimed it had withdrawn
its last troops from the country.
   Thousands of rounds of rockets and artillery have been exchanged
in recent days as guerrillas advanced toward the town through the
surrounding rice fields.
   The guerrillas cut off the government's only remaining supply
route to Svay Chek, Route 69, in fighting Friday.
   Guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government Thursday
increased the number of defenders at Svay Chek to 2,000 by trucking
800 more soldiers just hours before Route 69 was cut.
   The guerrillas said they have opened infiltration routes by
using sticks and knives to clear minefields surrounding the town.
   ``Men were assigned one square meter of ground each to dig up
the mines during the night,'' Pan Thai said.
   He said his forces destroyed one tank and an armored personnel
carrier with newly acquired Swedish anti-tank weapons.
   The guerrillas said more than 7,000 civilians had been living in
Svay Chek but most of them fled in recent days.
   The guerrillas said they spoke with the government soldiers at
Svay Chek during the assaults.
   ``We will kill you if you don't leave now,'' one guerrilla
commander told the soldiers holed up in the southern part of the
town.
   ``You live in the jungle. You do not know how to run the
country,'' the other side responded.
   Most of the war has been limited to a slice of territory
bordering Thailand. The capital of Phnom Penh has been almost
untouched by fighting.
   But the Khmer Rouge, who are allied with the liberation front,
claimed in a radio broadcast Saturday they lobbed several grenades
at a monastery and other areas of Phnom Penh on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   ``Some enemies were killed or wounded in these grenade attacks.
The enemies are in great alarm,'' claimed the broadcast, a text of
which was seen in Bangkok on Sunday.
   There was no way to confirm the report. Some previous Khmer
Rouge claims of attacks on cities were proven false.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled for nearly four years and committed
widespread massacres before they were ousted by Vietnam's invasion
in late 1978.

   Tens of thousands of Ukrainians demonstrated in
three cities Sunday to demand legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, banned since the rule of dictator Josef Stalin,
activists reported.
   The protest was timed to put pressure on Soviet authorities
before Friday's meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Pope John
Paul II at the Vatican, the first encounter between a Kremlin
leader and the head of Roman Catholicism.
   Anatoly Dotsenko, a Moscow-based member of the human rights
organizaton Ukrainian Helsinki Group, said the group's sources in
three cities _ Lvov, Chernovtsy and Ivano-Frankovsk _ reported
demonstrations attended by tens of thousands.
   The Rome-based head of the Ukrainian church, Cardinal Myroslav
Lubachivsky, urged a day of prayer and fasting Sunday for
legalization of the church.
   ``In the coming day, the fate of our church will be decided,''
he wrote in a letter to Ukrainian Catholics.
   The status of the church is expected to be a central topic in
the Vatican talks.
   Stalin merged the Ukrainian church with the Russian Orthodox
Church in 1946. The church continued to operate underground and in
the past two years Ukrainian Catholics have come out into the open
to demand official recognition from Moscow.
   According to Western estimates, there are more than 4 million
Catholics in the Ukraine.

<TEXT>
   An English professor who searched
the world to complete a seven-volume collection of Byron's works
found one last poem just five minutes away from his office in a
University of Virginia library.
   As he was putting the finishing touches on the final book of his
collection of the English Romantic poet's works, he learned of an
early 19th-century American edition of George Gordon Byron's poems.
   ``This particular edition has not been noticed before. It was
published without the author's permission,'' said Professor Jerome
McGann.
   The volume contains a poem that McGann said has never been
included in an authorized Byron collection.
   McGann said the four-line verse, ``On the Regency,'' is one of
80 to 90 ``new'' poems in ``The Complete Poetical Works of Lord
Byron.''
   ``Some of these have never been known to exist, others have been
printed, but only in obscure books,'' McGann said. ``This is the
first complete Byron collection since the turn of the century, and
the first to contain these poems.''
   McGann said he began work on the Byron collection in 1970. He
had not known of the existence of the poem he found last week until
a colleague asked him recently if he thought the poem was
authentic, McGann said.
   The scholar said every piece included in the compilation was
painstakingly authenticated.
   Byron wrote from 1806 to 1824, and is remembered for such poems
as ``Don Juan'' and ``Childe Harold.''
   ``He fell out of favor for much of the 20th century, because his
work ran against the grain of the century's cherished ideas about
poetry,'' McGann said. ``Now, however, critics look at Bryon
differently. If there is any traditional British writer who would
be seen as being `post-modern,' it would surely be Byron.''
   Oxford University Press will publish McGann's seven-volume set
in the fall.

<HEAD>Newly Released History Details Internal Bickering Among Government
Spies</HEAD>

   The State Department, FBI and armed services
hampered the Central Intelligence Agency in its infancy by
bickering about authority over covert activities and other
operations, according to a long-secret CIA history of the spy
agency's early years.
   The 1,000-page narrative, written in 1953 by historian Arthur B.
Darling, is the first CIA document to be declassified and
transferred to the National Archives for release to the public
under the spy agency's historical review program.
   A copy of it was delivered to President Bush on Wednesday by
William Webster, director of the CIA, and Don W. Wilson, archivist
of the United States.
   Webster said other CIA records will be declassified and
transferred to the Archives.
   The declassified version of Darling's history is accompanied by
a note from the CIA's history staff cautioning readers that the
former Yale history professor, who was the agency's first
historian, had ``a definite and sometimes controversial point of
view.''
   ``Darling blames the State Department, the FBI, and what he
terms the military establishment _ especially the heads of the
military intelligence services _ for much of the hardship which the
early CIA (and its predecessor, the Central Intelligence Group)
endured,'' the note says.
   The history staff also said that the late Allen Dulles, when he
became director of central intelligence in 1953, ``reportedly ...
did not concur with Darling's conclusions and ... restricted access
to the history.''
   Darling was the agency's historian from 1952 to 1954. He died in
1971.
   He wrote that sniping by the military departments began as soon
as the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the CIA, was
established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II.
   Brig. Gen. John Magruder, deputy director of the OSS, told
Darling that career military officers ``lowered their horns''
against the expert economists, geographers, historians and
scientists recruited for the new spying network.
   Darling conceded in his history that the military might have
been justified in withholding information because the OSS
``deserved part of its reputation for being a sieve.''
   He quoted OSS chief William J. ``Wild Bill'' Donovan, however,
as saying it was the military men who were the ``leaky boys.''
   In any event, Darling wrote, ``They are reluctant to this moment
in 1953 to give a central civilian agency intelligence which
exposes their capabilities in war.
   ``The result has been interference with the flow of raw
materials essential to the realistic estimates which should go to
the makers of diplomatic policy and military strategy,'' he said.
   ``The Army, Navy and the Department of State were always glad to
use the research and analysis branch of the Office of Strategic
Services as a servant,'' he wrote. ``They were not willing to
accept it as an equal partner in final judgments.''
   As the war approached an end, Donovan proposed to the president
on Nov. 18, 1944, that the OSS be turned into a permanent central
intelligence system.
   ``But this was not to happen,'' Darling wrote. ``The Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the armed services accepted the
invitation to combat vociferously and at length. ... The Department
of State proceeded with its own plan, aided and encouraged by the
Bureau of the Budget and the Department of Justice.''
   Donovan's plan was leaked to the press and led to editorials
denouncing it as a ``superspy system'' and a ``police state'' and
complaints in Congress that the government envisioned creating a
``super-Gestapo.''
   President Truman disbanded the OSS on Sept. 20, 1945 and ordered
the State Department to take the lead in developing a postwar
intelligence network. In doing so, wrote Darling, he turned aside a
Justice Department plan to make the FBI the center of the national
intelligence system.
   On Jan. 24, 1946, he issued a directive creating the Central
Intelligence Group. It was prohibited from interfering with
``internal security functions.''
   ``Succeeding directors of central intelligence were to have a
merry time with J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI,'' Darling wrote.
   Hoover even maintained that the FBI needed posts abroad, at
least in the Western Hemisphere, to protect internal security. He
agreed to withdraw his agents from Latin America but was ``irate''
at being required to do so, Darling said.
   The Central Intelligence Group became the Central Intelligence
Agency in 1947 as part of the same law that merged the War and Navy
departments into the new Department of Defense.
   The subject of covert activities, which would become the most
controversial part of the CIA's operations, arose later that year
when the National Security Council issued a secret directive
assigning the CIA the task of undercover psychological warfare
against the Soviet Union and its satellites.
   Sabotage and physical subversion had been high on Donovan's
agenda in wartime, but Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoeter, the first CIA
director, was reluctant to take them on and argued that Congress
would have to be informed beforehand and its approval obtained.
   The NSC overruled Hillenkoeter, saying Congress had already
given the agency power ``to perform such other functions and duties
related to intelligence activities affecting the national security
as the National Security Council may from time to time direct.''
   The decision would lead to repeated clashes between Congress and
succeeding administrations as lawmakers complained of CIA covert
actions in Central America and elsewhere.
   Darling wrote that Hillenkoeter, although ``not pleased'' with
the decision, did not object to the assignment.
   However, said the historian, ``Neither the Armed Services nor
the State Department intended him to have a free hand. They were
determined that there should be some guidance other than broad
policy determined by the National Security Council and began
negotiations to obtain another directive. ... ''
   The dispute was settled by another secret order making the
director of central intelligence responsible for ``ensuring through
designated representatives of the secretary of state and of the
secretary of defense'' that covert operations were consistent with
foreign and military policy.
   ``Hillenkoetter felt that the State Department and the military
establishment, in their struggle for power, wanted the office in
the Central Intelligence Agency because neither wanted the other to
have it,'' Darling wrote. ``If it failed they could disown it.
Meanwhile, both wished to control it.''

   The Ukrainian Catholic faith was banned 43
years ago, but several million people have kept it alive. Here are
sketches of three:
   _Ivan Gel, 52, spent 18 years in Soviet prison camps for
nationalist and human rights activities, and for his support of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church. He now heads the main organization
pressing for legal recognition.
   Gel says the church is an integral part of the ethnic character
of a people whose region has been traded and conquered by powerful
neighbors for centuries.
   _The Rev. Yevstavi Smal, 68, was a young monk in Lvov when the
church was banned in 1946. Like other priests who refused to join
the Russian Orthodox Church, he was sent to a prison camp.
   Smal served 10 years in the Soviet Far North and his chin
permanently rests on his chest because of a neck injury received in
the camp. Since his release in 1958, he has had no apartment of his
own and must depend on the charity of believers.
   He has been arrested 10 times for conducting private religious
services.
   ``We've already won morally,'' he said.
   _The Rev. Yaroslav Chukhny, 35, son of devout Ukrainian
Catholics, says he is among many young men from the Western Ukraine
who hid themselves in the Russian Orthodox clergy.
   After serving in one of Lvov's largest churches, the Cathedral
of the Transfiguration, for less than a year, he declared
allegiance to Rome on Oct. 29.

   Preston K. Covey knows from his own bitter
experience what can happen when computer users ignore ethical
standards of behavior.
   ``I've lost hours because of viruses or computer mischief of one
form or another over the years,'' says Covey, director of the
Center for Design of Educational Computing at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.
   Now, he is helping plan a National Science Foundation conference
for computer scientists and philosophers to discuss ethical
questions posed by the explosive growth of computer technology.
   According to Covey and other experts, increased concern over the
security of their own computer files has helped spur university
faculty members and students across the country to pay more serious
attention to issues of computer ethics.
   This has resulted in more campus lectures, symposiums, workshops
and entire courses devoted to ethical and social implications of
computing.
   Key ethical questions include privacy of computer-stored
information, effects of computerization on the distribution of
power in society, liability for malfunctions in computer programs
and the creation of malicious software such as computer viruses.
   Joseph Turner, chairman of the Computer Science Accreditation
Commission, estimates that half the 80 colleges and universities
with computer science programs accredited by his organization offer
computer ethics courses _ up from about 10 percent five years ago.
   ``It's very definitely on the increase,'' said Turner, chairman
of the computer science department at South Carolina's Clemson
University.
   The risks of computer abuse were dramatized in November 1988
when a Cornell University graduate student unleashed a computer
``worm'' into the Internet electronic network. About 6,000
computers connected to the network were paralyzed.
   The worm's creator, Robert Tappan Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md.,
has been indicted under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
and is to go on trial Nov. 29 in Syracuse, N.Y.
   At the urging of a university panel that investigated the Morris
case, Cornell's computing board this fall adopted a statement of
principles for faculty, staff and students.
   ``The use of computers and network systems in no way exempts you
from the normal requirements of ethical behavior in the Cornell
University community,'' the statement says. It calls on all
computer users to respect the privacy of other users' data, the
ownership of proprietary software and the procedures established to
manage computer systems.
   Buck BloomBecker, director of the National Center for Computer
Crime Data, a non-profit research institute based in Los Angeles,
said that recently ``I've seen a lot more talking about the need
for ethics. ... Some of the people who are doing the talking are
taking action.''
   Part of the reason, he said, is that ``more faculty members and
students are being victimized by computer crime, because of things
like viruses. And that makes the topic less academic and more
gripping to them.''
   But despite such increased attention to computer ethics,
BloomBecker said, ``it's still just a drop in the bucket.''
   ``One of the hard facts that we have to confront is that a lot
of people think that science and business work a lot better if you
don't hamper them with ethics,'' he said.
   A group of academic specialists met Nov. 1 in suburban
Arlington, Va., to draft plans for an August 1991 computer ethics
conference expected to involve 300 to 500 computer professionals,
philosophers, social scientists, public policymakers and business
people.
   Planning for the conference is being carried out under a grant
from the Ethics and Values Studies Program of the National Science
Foundation, a federal agency that distributes research grants.
   The head of the planning group, Terrell W. Bynum, director of
the Research Center on Computing and Society at Southern
Connecticut State University in New Haven, said the gathering would
mark ``the first international congress for integrating human
values into computing.''
   Deborah G. Johnson, a philosopher at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, N.Y., said the amount of substantive
communication going on now between computer professionals and
philosophers is still fairly limited.
   ``There's no incentive for computer scientists to worry about
this,'' she said. ``They don't get any credit for being worried
about the social impacts. They're supposed to publish technical
papers. And philosophers have the same emphasis. They're not
supposed to dirty their hands by dealing in the real world. They're
supposed to publish abstract, theoretical papers that have nothing
to do with anything real.''
   Ms. Johnson said a textbook she wrote on computer ethics is
being used this academic year at 93 colleges and universities _
approximately double the number of schools which utilized it last
year.
   Institutions that offer courses dealing with computer ethics and
the social implications of computing include Carnegie Mellon;
Clemson; Southern Connecticut State; Rensselaer Polytechnic; the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; Stanford
University, Palo Alto, Calif.; the University of California
campuses at Berkeley and Irvine; Northeastern University, Boston,
and the University of Washington, Seattle;
   At Carnegie Mellon, Covey said a major question facing the
computing profession is, ``How do you bring about the kind of
institutionalized awareness that you see today in medical ethics?''
   ``If you look back 20 years, when that area was really in a very
formative stage, philosophers and medical professionals were very
wary of each other. It's come a long way since then,'' he said.
   Covey, chairman of the American Philosophical Association's
Committee on Computer Use in Philosophy, said that up to now he
believes there has been ``real timidity about bringing the hammer
of justice down ... on hackers who abuse the system.''
   ``I think that when damage is caused _ in terms of person-hours
lost, property lost, work lost _ it ought to be treated just like
the case of arson or breaking and entering, where there are actual
and measurable harms,'' he said. ``It's perfectly analogous to if
somebody broke into your office and destroyed or stole paper
files.''

   Gov.-elect L. Douglas Wilder has taken
descriptions of his ``razor-thin'' victory margin at face value,
shaving off his mustache while he waits for official vote totals to
be released Monday.
   The Democrat, vying to become the nation's first elected black
governor, went ahead and fulfilled a promise to a reporter that he
would shave off the mustache if he beat Republican J. Marshall
Coleman.
   The lieutenant governor first appeared in public last week
without the mustache he has worn since his state Senate days in the
1970s, prompting a flurry of inquiries.
   ``It's amazing how much attention it has garnered,'' said Laura
Dillard, Wilder's press secretary. ``But hey, I'd rather talk about
that than some other subjects.''
   On Monday, the State Board of Elections will certify the results
of the balloting for which unofficial tallies showed Wilder
defeating Coleman by fewer than 6,800 votes, at 897,025 for Wilder
and 890,273 for Coleman.
   State certification is made after all cities and counties have
checked their Nov. 7 election results and reported the figures to
the board, which also checks the results against registered voter
lists.
   Coleman, a former state attorney general, has said he may seek a
recount if the official margin is less than a half-percent of the
1.78 million ballots cast, or about 9,000 votes. He has 10 days
from the certification to make the recount request.
   If the unofficial count is correct, ``we're well within that
margin,'' said Mike Salster, a spokesman for the state Republican
Party.
   ``We're proceeding with the assumption that a recount will be
called for,'' Salster said.
   It was the closest race for governor in state history, and there
is no precedent for a statewide recount, said Susan Fitz-Hugh,
secretary of the board of elections.
   Mrs. Fitz-Hugh has declined to estimate the length of time or
cost of a recount, which would be overseen by a panel of three
judges.
   Wilder has steered clear of comments on whether Coleman should
accept the certified vote or would be justified in seeking a
recount.
   ``We've said all along the ball is in the loser's court,'' Ms.
Dillard said.
   Wilder has appointed a transition team director and taken other
steps toward preparing to become Virginia's third straight
Democratic governor on Jan. 13.
   He also has dismissed suggestions that his victory showed racism
among voters.
   Pre-election and exit polls showed Wilder winning by as much as
10 percent. His running mates, Donald S. Beyer Jr. for lieutenant
governor and Mary Sue Terry for re-election as attorney general,
won by comfortable margins of 54 percent and 63 percent,
respectively.
   Wilder, a former state senator from Richmond, was elected
lieutenant governor in 1985 with almost 52 percent of the vote.

<HEAD>Number of Convicts on Parole Jumps 12.5 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of parolees from state and federal
prison sentences went up 12.5 percent in 1988 to post the largest
increase of the decade, according to a recent Justice Department
study.
   The figures also show a significant increase _ 8.7 percent _ in
the number of people who were on parole last year from federal
prison sentences.
   The 8.7 percent increase capped a five-year period during which
the number of federal parolees went from 16,325 to 20,487.
   Overall, the number of adults on parole from state and federal
prison sentences increased from 362,748 at the start of 1988 to
407,977 at year's end, according to the study by the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   The increase in the overall number of parolees in 1988 was the
largest since 1983 when there was a 12.06 percent hike from 224,604
to 251,708 parolees, according to previous reports issued by the
department.
   There was a net increase last year from 18,846 to 20,484 federal
parolees, the study said. There were 13,288 new parolees in 1988
while 11,647 ended terms of parole supervision.
   Last year's 8.7 percent increase in federal parolees was sharply
higher than the 6.2 percent hike in 1987. There were also annual
increases from 1984 through 1986 ranging from 1.5 percent to 5.5
percent.
   The five-year period of increases followed three successive
annual declines. The number of federal parolees dropped 9.7 percent
in 1981, 9.4 percent in 1982 and 7.5 percent in 1983.
   Benjamin F. Baer, chairman of the U.S. Parole Commission, said
last year's increase is a result of a sharp increase in the number
of federal inmates in the last decade. ``As the prison population
goes up the number of people on parole supervision goes up.''
   He noted that in 1984 there were some 30,000 federal prisoners.
   On Nov. 16, there were 52,741 federal prisoners, the latest
count taken by the Bureau of Prisons. The overcrowded federal
prison system has an inmate population that is 65 percent higher
than it was built to hold.
   Baer denied that overcrowding is a factor in determining whether
federal prisoners are granted parole. Parole decisions are made
according to guidelines that take into account the prisoner's
behavior and his attitude toward his crime, Baer said.
   Some states, however, use parole as a way to relieve
overcrowding.
   Alabama, where a 36 percent increase in paroles was the largest
among states last year, paroles prisoners convicted of property
crimes to make room for violent offenders, said Don Drasheff, a
spokesman for the state board of pardons and paroles.
   Enough inmates were paroled this year to ``save populating two
major prisons,'' he said.
   North Carolina, which posted a 33.3 percent increase in paroles
last year, has a law that limits the number of inmates that can be
held in state prisons to 17,640.
   A prison emergency that recently ended was declared in September
after the inmate population stayed above the ceiling for 15
straight days.
   So many low-risk inmates were paroled during the 58-day
emergency that state prison spokesman David Guth said he doubted
``we've left anybody for the governor to commute'' at Christmas.

<TEXT>
   A state Senate race that started out ho-hum has
thrust one of the candidates into the national spotlight since a
bishop banned her from taking Communion because of her pro-choice
stance on abortion.
   The Roman Catholic bishop said candidate Lucy Killea's public
position is a blatant affront to the church.
   Killea has been besieged by interview requests from all over the
country and has made two national television appearances while
abortion rights advocates rally around her.
   Newspaper polls also show an overwhelming majority of Catholics
and non-Catholics in San Diego County object to Bishop Leo T.
Maher's sanction, the first of its kind in the nation against an
elected official and which many see as an unacceptable intrusion of
religion into politics.
   Killea, a Democrat and four-term assemblywoman from San Diego,
is on the Dec. 5 special election ballot for a seat vacated by a
resignation. Her Republican opponent is fellow Assemblywoman Carol
Bentley of El Cajon.
   Most political leaders agree the bishop's order significantly
enhances Killea's prospects of winning in a district where 49
percent of registered voters are Republican, compared to 38 percent
Democrats.
   However, Bentley believes her partisan advantage will offset any
adverse impact the controversy has on her campaign.
   ``This is still a Republican district, and I'm the Republican
candidate ... (but) the bishop certainly did take the campaign out
of our hands,'' she said.
   Bentley believes the winner will be the candidate whose
supporters are more motivated to go to the polls. That's why she
declined a request to appear with Killea on the Phil Donahue show
Nov. 20, believing her time was better spent campaigning.
   ``Personally, I don't care about my nationwide name ID _ I care
about what it is in the 39th District,'' she said.
   Killea says interviews and national television appearances have
cut into campaign time, but she's doing them because of the effect
the Communion ban might have on other Catholic elected officials
and potential politicians.
   She said she's afraid the bishop's order ``will prevent younger
people from getting involved in politics when they otherwise might
consider it.''
   Maher's order barring Killea from participating in Communion in
the Roman Catholic Church was issued one day after her campaign
began running television ads outlining the difference between her
stand on abortion and Bentley's.
   The ads talk about anti-abortion advocates ``dedicated to
turning back the clock on women's rights,'' and say there's a
danger that Californians once again may see ``painful, scary
back-alley abortions'' if those people get their way.
   Bentley, a Presbyterian, believes abortions should be permitted
only in cases of rape, incest or severe health complications for
the mother. She has kept her distance in the Killea-Maher rift,
calling it ``something between Lucy and her church.''
   Maher, head of the San Diego Diocese, notified Killea of the
sanction in a letter that said her advertisements and pro-choice
comments during the campaign ``are in complete contradiction to the
moral teachings of the Catholic Church.''
   A poll of San Diego County residents found 69 percent of
Catholics and 70 percent of non-Catholics disagreed with Maher's
order. Among Catholics, 72 percent of 405 people surveyed randomly
also said they disagree with the Catholic Church's stance on
abortion.
   The bishop denied any attempt to influence the race.
   ``If she hadn't run those ads, probably nothing would have been
done. But those ads are flagrantly contrary to the moral law of the
Catholic Church, and I think she brought this on herself,'' Maher
said.

<HEAD>Third World Spending for Future Starts to Rise Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending for the future in the Third World is
rising again, especially on such things as equipment that creates
new jobs, according to figures assembled from 30 countries.
   On the other hand, spending is not generally up on schools to
train potential workers.
   Much private investment in the Third World has come from the
United States and other industrial countries. During most of the
1980s all investment, public and private, had gone down in poor
countries.
   The newer trend was spotted by Guy P. Pfeffermann of France for
the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank
that lends directly to businesses instead of going through
governments.
   Though percentage rises are small, they amount to many billions
of dollars when figured against total production. The total
production of Argentina, for example, was about $73 billion in
1986. When that rose by only 0.8 percent in 1987, it meant an
increase of nearly $600 million.
   ``Private investment seems to have begun to recover somewhat
after reaching its low point about 1985-86,'' Pfeffermann wrote in
a newly-published discussion paper.
   Recommending that private investors take advantage of the trend,
he pointed out a sharp variation in regions: private investment in
recent years has amounted to 15 percent of production in East Asia,
9 percent in Latin America, 8 percent in South Asia and 6 percent
in Africa.
   His figures show that private investment rose steadily through
most of the 1970s. He dated a decline, which may now be reversed,
from the ``second oil shock'' of 1979. That was when the revolution
in Iran sent the price of oil up again. The first oil shock came in
1973 when Arab oil producers raised prices as part of their
conflict with Israel. It apparently did not have as much effect.
   Public investment includes spending by governments on schools,
medical care, roads, harbors and other projects needed to make a
country viable. In the Third World it also includes considerable
money for new installations and equipment, since business people
there are less likely to make that kind of investment.
   Some governments in poor countries have also considered
themselves socialist. They have seen a larger place for themselves
in business than has been the case with most governments of
industrial countries, especially in the era of such champions of
private enterprise as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
   Third World public investment began falling in 1983, according
to Pfeffermann's figures. It peaked in 1982 at 10.6 percent of the
30 countries' total production.
   ``It was the beginning of the Third World debt crisis,''
Pfeffermann said in an interview. ``After that, governments found
themselves having to pay out so much on their foreign debt that
they cut back other spending.''
   By 1988, the proportion of public investment to production was
down to 7.2 percent.
   Pfeffermann's results were borne out by a survey of Africa
released Tuesday by the World Bank. For example, the bank showed
the government of Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa,
spending 4.5 percent of its budget on education in 1980 and only
2.8 percent in 1987. Health expenditures were 2.5 percent in 1980
and 0.7 percent in 1987. Housing, amenities, social security and
welfare _ treated by the bank as a single item _ were down to 1.5
percent from 6.6 percent.
   Pfeffermann found public investment in Nigeria back up to 8.8
percent of production in 1988, almost twice the 4.3 percent of 1984
but still well below the 15.4 percent of 1981.
   Private investment in the 30 countries dropped from 23.8 percent
of production in 1980 to 18.5 percent in 1985, but three years
later it had crept back up to 18.9 percent. The countries showing a
rise in private investment since 1983 or 1984 were: Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala.
Hungary, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal,
Thailand, Turkey and Uruguay.
   Private investment fell in relation to total production only in
Bangladesh, Malaysia, the Philippines and Tunisia.
   It held steady in Pakistan, Singapore, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

   Even the chairman of the New Orleans Aviation
Board is joining the list of people unhappy about the new parking
garage at New Orleans International Airport.
   Stephen Murray returned home from a vacation to discover that a
leak in the garage ceiling directly over his reserved parking spot
had damaged the paint on his wife's new Mercedes Benz convertible.
   ``I'm not too upset, as long as the people responsible for the
claim repair my car,'' he said. ``In the meantime, I told them to
find me another parking spot.''
   Airport patrons say the garage, which ran millions of dollars
over budget, is difficult to maneuver in, the traffic flow is
confusing and there aren't enough signs. Architects consulted by
The Times-Picayune said it cost nearly twice as much per space as
did four other major parking garages completed in the area over the

   In an electoral version of the mouse
that roared, vote fraud in a rural backwater is threatening the
dynasty that has dominated the world's biggest democracy since
independence in 1947.
   The shenanigans in Amethi, the parliamentary district of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, also have highlighted political problems in
India, where criminals unite with politicians, distributing slush
funds and rigging votes.
   But the decision to call a re-vote in the 1,320-square-mile
dusty mix of rural poverty and boomtown also has given some cause
for hope.
   The Election Commission, which is supposed to be an independent
watchdog agency, reportedly was pressured by Gandhi's governing
Congress Party to reject calls for a re-vote in the district 350
miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Trouble began in Amethi on Wednesday, the first day of voting in
the national parliamentary election.
   An influential opposition leader, Sanjay Singh, was shot in the
stomach in a clash with Congress Party workers.
   Gandhi's opponent for the Parliament seat, Raj Mohan Gandhi,
alleged that police roughed him up when he went to a polling booth
to check reports of fraud. Raj Mohan Gandhi, who is unrelated to
the prime minister, is the grandson of Mohandas K. Gandhi, India's
beloved independence leader.
   The opposition demanded a re-poll, and the Election Commission
sent a four-man team to Amethi to investigate. The decision came
early Sunday after a marathon meeting: Re-voting was ordered for 98
booths in the district on Monday. Each precinct has about 1,000
voters.
   The commission also sacked two top police officers who had
supervised the vote.
   The decision dealt a stunning blow to the prestige of Gandhi,
the 45-year-old former airline pilot who became prime minister on a
wave of sympathy following the Oct. 31, 1984, assassination of his
mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Voting fraud is a common feature in Indian politics but never
had re-polling been ordered in the prime minister's own backyard.
   Gandhi's position already had been weakened by criticism of his
leadership and reports of high-level corruption in his government
stemming from a $1.4 billion weapons deal.
   In addition, the prime minister's Congress Party, which has
ruled India for all but 29 months since independence from British
rule, is facing the most cohesive challenge ever from a five-party
opposition coalition, the National Front.
   But even if Congress wins a majority in Parliament, many say
Gandhi's position as prime minister is in doubt.
   ``No one wants a prime minister who can't even control his own
constituency,'' said Bhabani Sen Gupta, a noted political
commentator.

   His expertise has been in demand all over
southern California and his success is measured in millions of
dollars, but Dandy Vom Sargau is retiring in January at the peak of
his career.
   During his six years of sniffing out drugs for the suburb of
Monrovia, the 9-year-old German shepherd has been on more than 400
cases and helped seize more than $1 billion worth of illicit drugs,
said his handler, Monrovia Police Officer Rick Miglia.
   ``He thinks it's fun,'' Miglia said.
   ``I don't think he's ever made a mistake,'' said Jake Jahelka of
Canine K-9 Scents Inc., the academy that trained Dandy.
   Dandy even had a hand _ er, nose _ in the nation's largest
cocaine bust.
   After getting a sniff of a cardboard box found outside a Los
Angeles warehouse, he went into a snarling frenzy.
   ``His alert on that box was a part of the overall probable cause
that led to the search warrant,'' said Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge.
   Officers serving the warrant on the warehouse found 21 tons of
cocaine. Six people were arrested and $12.2 million in cash was
seized.
   Dandy's reputation has spread so far that Monrovia has lent him
to the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, FBI, California Highway Patrol, the Secret Service and
the Postal Service.
   The job has had its drawbacks. Police keep Dandy celibate and on
a dry-food diet so the odors of meat and female dogs won't distract
him while he's working.
   Life should be easier in retirement, when Miglia will keep his
old partner at home.
   But the rest of the department will miss the 85-pound canine.
   ``I'm in awe when I watch him work,'' said Officer Scott Wiese.
``It just freaks me out, he's so smart.''

<HEAD>Beijing's Communist Party Bars Private Entrepreneurs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing's Communist Party has barred private
entrepreneurs from joining its ranks in the latest move to purge
those working outside the state-controlled system.
   The Beijing Daily reported that municipal party officials, in a
three-day meeting ending Saturday, decided that private businessmen
and those who earn livings by using the labor of others will not be
allowed to become party members.
   The new regulation, proposed by Organization Department chief
Chen Guangwen, also states that private entrepreneurs who are
already party members must strictly observe party line and thought.
   They must use their profits for public benefit, carry out tasks
assigned them by the party, and pay party fees in accordance with
their real incomes.
   The Saturday report did not say how many private entrepreneurs
belonged to the party, but their numbers are believed to be
negligible.
   The Communist Party nationwide has 48 million members, less than
5 percent of the population. Most members are workers, farmers and
bureaucrats.
   The nation's 12 million private entrepreneurs, mostly running
small free- market clothing and food stalls, have generally stayed
out of politics.
   The party directive, however, shows the declining status of
private businesses. Before the June military crackdown on
pro-democracy dissent, they were hailed for providing needed
services and employment and giving competition to inefficient
state-run firms.
   The government now says private enterprise can continue to play
a peripheral economic role, but tighter surveillance has driven
several million private entrepreneurs out of business.

<HEAD>Congressional Adjournment Offers Breathing Room to ``Keating 5''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An early adjournment by Congress this year is
giving the ``Keating 5'' senators who intervened with federal
regulators on behalf of the now-failed Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association a brief respite from the spotlight of formal
investigations.
   But even in the absence of public hearings, investigations
continue by two committees of Congress and several federal agencies
into how the California thrift owned by Phoenix millionaire Charles
H. Keating Jr. became possibly the biggest case of bank fraud in
history.
   And there is no shortage of opportunities for the major players
in the unfolding drama to make voluntary appearances.
   Two of the five accepted invitations to reiterate their defenses
on television Sunday, appearing along with one of their chief
accusers and the embattled federal regulator who is under growing
pressure to resign because of his role in dealing with the collapse
of Lincoln and scores of other S&amp;Ls.
   ``These are just the initial stage of an ongoing progress,''
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez said at the
conclusion last week of six hearings into why taxpayers are going
to have to pay up to $2.5 billion to depositors who trusted their
savings to Keating and his associates.
   According to regulators, that money _ in the form of S&amp;L
deposits insured by the federal government _ was lost to an
elaborate ``pyramid scheme'' of phoney real estate and other deals
perpetrated by Keating.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, put the cost of the Lincoln bailout
alone at $50 out of the pockets of every American family.
   Named during 50 hours of testimony as accomplices in the scheme
_ knowing or unknowing _ were five U.S. senators, the nation's top
thrift regulators, former President Reagan's chief of staff, one of
the nation's most prestigious accounting firms and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``Everybody that had a position of trust and responsibility has
a tremendous accounting to make to the American people still,''
said Gonazalez, a populist Texas Democrat who has taken a
let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may approach into his investigation
of what went wrong.
   M. Danny Wall, the chief S&amp;L regulator, said Sunday he has no
intention ``at this point'' of resigning as head of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision. President Bush two weeks
ago said he had not ruled out replacing Wall.
   Wall acknowledged on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley''
that ``we have in the final analysis made some mistakes,'' but
added that as the investigation proceeds, ``time will indeed be
kind to us.''
   Keating and a then-managing partner of the ``Big Eight''
accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. _ now Ernst &amp; Young _ that
served as Lincoln's auditor have declined to give a public
accounting.
   Of more than two dozen witnesses subpoenaed for the House
hearings, they were the only two to claim a Fifth Amendment
constitutional right to not testify on the grounds that what they
might say under oath could incriminate them.
   The five senators _ who received or solicited a total of $1.3
million in campaign and other political funds from Keating _ have
avoided testifying so far.
   Gonzalez and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said at the
opening of the hearings in October that it would be futile for the
House committee to subpoena the senators. Both cited precedents of
similar attempts in which senators simply refused to honor a
subpoena.
   And none of the five _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
and John McCain, R-Ariz. _ volunteered to subject themselves to a
grilling from their colleagues sitting on the other side of the
Capitol dome.
   All have acknowledged meeting with regulators from the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board in early 1987 on behalf of Keating _ ``their
friend and contributor'' _ as described by then-Bank Board Chairman
Edwin J. Gray, one of the meeting participants.
   Gray reiterated on the Brinkley show Sunday that the lawmakers
improperly pressured him as a favor to Keating. ``They were asking
me to withdraw a regulation for their friend,'' Gray said. ``I
said, `We're not going to do that.'''
   Glenn responded by repeating his strong contention that he did
nothing improper.
   ``Any implication that I have done something wrong in this case
is just flat wrong, and I resent it with every fiber in my being,''
Glenn said on the Brinkley show.
   McCain, appearing on the same show, likewise reiterated his
slightly less strident stance that ``it was a serious mistake on my
part'' to have not immediately made reimbursements for trips taken
on Keating's corporate plane, but that inquiries eventually will
clear him of any rule breaking.
   ``I did nothing that I wouldn't do for any major employer, or
economic factor, in my state,'' McCain said.
   Brinkley said Cranston, Riegle and DeConcini declined
invitations to appear on his show.
   At the time of the meetings on behalf of Keating, regulators had
been watching Lincoln evolve from a typical home mortgage lender
into the epitome of the ``high-flyer'' S&amp;Ls that prompted the need
for a $150 billion-plus taxpayer bailout of the industry this year.
   All five senators have said they violated no law nor rule of the
Senate. Nonetheless, the Senate Ethics Committee two weeks ago
appointed an outside counsel to investigate charges that their
intervention constituted a conflict of interest.
   The Senate's rules on such conflicts say that a senator cannot
``permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest from
any source ... by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his
position as a member.''
   To one degree or another, all five senators claim the influence
they exerted was not improper. All maintain they have and will
continue to do the same thing for any constituent, regardless of
whether the constituent has contributed money to their political
causes.
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell wants to use
the Lincoln controversy to reignite a long-stalled effort for
so-called campaign finance reform in which public tax dollars would
replace private contributions in financing political candidates'
election pitches to the voting public.
   ``Can an elected official receive something from another person,
anything of value, and retain his or her independence of
judgment?'' Mitchell asked. ``That's the issue that's raised by all
of this.''

   Doctors, social workers and therapists are giving
a new name to a syndrome they say is draining their ranks:
``compassion fatigue.''
   It strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other people's
burdens, leaving little time or energy for themselves. Victims
become disillusioned and depressed, and often start to show cracks
in their professional veneer.
   ``Everyone that I work with is affected by it. I've felt it in
myself,'' said social worker Lydia Parsons of the Mid-Maine Medical
Center in Waterville. ``I've had other people tell me about it,
about me, before I was aware of it.''
   Compassion fatigue is gaining recognition. A half-dozen
presentations were devoted to it at a recent National Associations
of Social Workers conference. Dr. Edward Poliandro, of Mount Sinai
Medical School in New York, said people ``were hanging from the
rafters'' to hear his workshop on stress management.
   Some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress
management classes, longer staff meetings, and even daily walks
through the park.
   As many as 20 percent of caregiving professionals suffer such
burnout, said Dr. Lyle H. Miller, head of the Biobehavioral
Institute in Boston.
   Typical victims sound almost like TV stereotypes of social
workers or doctors, working too much, sleeping too little,
sacrificing their own lives and families for case after case.
``It's the best and the brightest and the most committed and the
most energetic that burn out,'' Miller said.
   Parsons is a classic example. As director of the social work
department at the Redington-Fairview Hospital in Skowhegan, Maine,
she was running on empty so often she couldn't do anything very
well. ``I always felt guilty even going for lunch, because there
was always someone waiting for me.''
   Parsons quit that job and, after a break in which she worked
part-time, joined Mid-Maine, where there are frequent staff
meetings and peer support.
   Thomas A. Welch, a former Catholic priest who left a Boston-area
hospice program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal
with the prospect of death, said he had been happy with his work
but that it was too consuming to stay good at it for long.
   ``It's very heavy emotional material. It's not something that
anyone should do for a very long time,'' said Welch, who left both
the church and the hospice in 1985 and now owns an Italian
restaurant. ``You get a sense that the whole world is dying after a
while. I heard a friend say I was a downer, I should find a way to
lighten up.''
   Compassion fatigue went unrecognized for a long time because of
the stigma attached to it, experts say.
   ``Very often people in any line of field would be looked down
upon if they were to acknowledge they were really stressed out,''
said Poliandro, who teaches stress management at the Mount Sinai
Medical School.
   ``There's a double standard of being in the helping profession
that we should be able to see it in ourselves'' before anxiety
becomes a crisis, said Parsons.
   When perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an
administrator's nightmare, Miller said. They can develop headaches,
backaches, fatigue, depression, and irritability. They might start
to abuse drugs and alcohol, or begin not showing up for work,
Poliandro said.
   The best way to fight compassion fatigue?
   Take a vacation, Poliandro and Miller agreed.
   Administrators can help, however. The boss can force workers to
take lunches away from their desk, outlaw working past 9 p.m., or
forbid employees to work weekends, Poliandro said.
   At Mount Sinai, personnel can enlist in the ``wellness''
program, which offers, among other activities, daily walks through
nearby Central Park. ``It's a rapid walk, to build up their health,
but also they do it just to enjoy being outside and away from the
pressures of the office,'' Poliandro said.
   Ultimately, professionals who help people have to teach
themselves how to stave off the needs of their own patients, said
Miller and Poliandro.
   ``Humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient,'' said
Poliandro. ``They just have to be able replenish their energy.''

   ``Landscape in the Mist,'' a movie about two boys
searching for their father, was named best film at this year's
European Film Awards, better known as the Felixes.
   The director, Theo Angelopoulos of Greece, received the prize
late Saturday at a theater on the Champs Elysees. The presentation
was the highlight of the second annual awards competition among
film makers from 27 countries.
   The jury, headed by Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, chose the
film ahead of five other nominees: the Soviet Union's ``Little
Vera,'' Hungary's ``Eldorado,'' Iceland's ``Magnus,'' Portugal's
``Memories of the Yellow House,'' and Britain's ``High Hopes.''
   Frenchman Philippe Noiret won the best actor prize for
performances in the French film ``Life and Nothing Else'' and the
Franco-Italian ``Paradise Cinema.'' Those films also won special
prizes from the jury for artistic merit.
   Britain's Ruth Sheen claimed the best actress award for Mike
Leigh's ``High Hopes,'' a satirical look at Thatcherite England,
which also walked away with prizes for best supporting actress Edna
Dore and composer Andrew Dickson.
   The jury selected Hungarian Geza Boszormenyi as best director
for ``Eldorado.'' His film ``Recsk 1950-1953,'' made jointly with
Livia Gyarmathi, was chosen as best documentary.
   Special prizes of lifetime achievements went to Italian director
Federico Fellini and French producer Anatole Dauman.
   The European Film Awards were created by the Berlin Senate and
the European Cinema Society in 1988 as a European rival to the
American Academy Awards.
   The Felix statuettes awarded as prizes take their name from
French Riviera restaurant ``Le Felix'' in Cannes, where the idea of
the project was conceived.

died in his sleep on Thanksgiving evening. He was 63 years old.
   His family said the cause of death was not known.
   Freeman began his career as a mail clerk-messenger in 1948,
ambitious to be involved in the AP photo operation. While still a
messenger, the bureau photo chief, Burt Foster, described him this
way: ``He has done a large number of photographic assignments, with
excellent results. His camera work shows thought and news sense. He
is quick to understand a situation, a necessity for a

handles commercial sales of AP photographs.
   Freeman is survived by four children. Services will be Wednesday

<TEXT>
   A homeland leader who has
embraced the anti-apartheid movement won the support of the African
National Congress on Sunday during an emotional rally attended by
50,000 people.
   The rally represented the strongest show of support for a
homeland ruler by anti-apartheid leaders. The activists have long
considered the leaders of the 10 black homelands part of the
apartheid system and collaborators with the white-led South African
government.
   The ANC leaders told the roaring crowd that they supported the
reforms being adopted by Gen. Bantu Holomisa, leader of the
Transkei homeland, and called him a ``spiritual member'' of their
guerrilla movement.
   Walter Sisulu, joined by six ANC colleagues, said the military
ruler has ``fully integrated (Transkei) into the national struggle
against apartheid.''
   ``We call on people in all (homelands) to follow your example,''
Sisulu told the cheering crowd at a sports stadium in Umtata,
Transkei's capital.
   It was an unprecedented show of support for a homeland ruler by
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. None of the homelands is
recognized by the ANC or abroad, but four, including Transkei, have
nominal independence.
   Holomisa, 34, clearly has earned the respect of the
anti-apartheid movement since coming to power two years ago in a
coup.
   He says the outlawed ANC is a key player in any political
settlement in South Africa and that he may legalize the group in
Transkei, the birthplace of many ANC leaders, including Sisulu and
the imprisoned Nelson Mandela.
   Holomisa recently lifted the state of emergency, freed political
prisoners and lifted bans on 15 anti-apartheid groups in the
homeland, which has 4 million residents scattered along South
Africa's southeastern coast.
   ``The ANC's army is alive and well in the Transkei alongside the
army of Gen. Holomisa, and it is my personal belief that Holomisa
is a spiritual member of Umkhonto we Sizwe (the ANC's armed
wing),'' said ANC leader Andrew Mlangeni.
   Sisulu and Mlangeni are among six ANC leaders who were released
last month after more than 25 years in prison. Five were present in
Umtata, along with Oscar Mpetha, 80, freed last month after five
years in jail, and Govan Mbeki, 79, released two years ago after 23
years in prison.
   The ANC leaders shared the stage with Holomisa and huge flags of
the ANC and its outlawed ally, the South African Communist Party.
Many in the crowd wore ANC T-shirts and sang in support of the
organization, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign against
the South African government. The rally was broadcast throughout
Transkei on the homeland-run radio station.
   Before the rally, Holomisa issued an apology for an incident
Saturday in which the ANC leaders were tear-gassed in an Umtata
church as they prepared to speak. In the ensuing melee, two members
of the 400-strong audience were killed by gunfire. The ANC leaders
escaped injury.
   ``We shoulder the blame for this incident entirely,'' said
Holomisa. ``It would appear that some of these renegade policemen
ignored policy and fired tear gas into a peaceful gathering.''
   In other developments Sunday:
   _Mandela's wife, Winnie, gave her first public speech since the
anti-apartheid movement expelled her in February and accused her
bodyguards of waging a ``reign of terror.'' Mrs. Mandela recently
has been appearing with anti-apartheid leaders, though no formal
reconciliation has been announced.
   In a brief speech in KwaThema, east of Johannesburg, she told
10,000 blacks that her husband is more concerned about achieving
democracy in South Africa than the timetable for his release.
   The government is expected to free Mandela within months. He is
serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
government.
   _In the black homeland of KwaZulu, 25,000 people marched to a
police station in KwaMashu and submitted a statement accusing
police of brutality and a ``general disregard for law and order.''

   Here are excerpts, as translated
by The Associated Press, of addresses at an opposition rally in
Prague on Sunday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, prominent dissident and leader of the Civic Forum
opposition group:
   One week ago, a people's movement began in Prague. For seven
days, Prague and the entire republic has been living through great
drama. After 40 years of totalitarian rule that manipulated them,
citizens have started to think and act freely.
   On behalf of the Civic Forum, I can announce that what we have
been calling for has happened: Dialogue has begun between the power
and the people. This morning, Premier Adamec has met with the Civic
Forum. On Tuesday we will meet again. I thank the premier for his
good will.
   Tomorrow we will show our determination to achieve democracy,
freedom and peace by a symbolic general strike. We ask you to make
sure that this strike will not threaten any vital functions of the
industry, the health of the people and lives. We do not want to
disrupt our economy. We want it to function better.
   We all ask what will come after the strike. The Civic Forum
suggests that the strike committees remain on permanent alert and
turn themselves into forums which will be the independent
representatives of the society throughout the republic.
   Civic Forum is ready to create a bridge for a peaceful path from
totalitarianism to civil freedom, which will later be guaranteed by
free elections. The Civic Forum is prepared to negotiate all stages
of the peaceful journey across this bridge.
   We know what we want _ truth, humanity and freedom. From now on,
we are all participating in the management of this country and we
are responsible for its fate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Premier Ladislav Adamec:
   I would like to thank the organizers of this rally for inviting
me. I will gladly explain my ideas, and I will listen to the
demands of any representatives of the public who are interested in
finding joint solutions of the problems that exist. That is why I
came here to join you.
   In only a few hours the general strike will begin. There is some
concern about what will happen and what the strike will bring. That
is why I proposed to look for an approach that will keep to a
minimum the damage it brings to the national economy.
   I am glad that all participants in the negotiations agree that
it should have a symbolic character. To state your views, it is not
necessary to strike for two hours. Two minutes would do.
   We must look for unity, without suspicion. We must try to
understand each other. That is why the government is prepared to
negotiate with everybody caring for the good of our country.
Throughout the country there is agreement in principle of the need
to speed up the reforms. Therefore it is necessary to limit the
social tension as soon as possible, to end strikes and
demonstrations.
   The enforcement of political demands must be in full agreement
with the efforts to improve the economic situation. This is what I
regard under the present conditions as the principal question.

   Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a draft law that
would have abolished the country's army by the year 2000, but the
law won more support than expected.
   Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger said he would set up a panel to
analyze criticisms voiced about the 625,000-strong army.
   The ``Switzerland has no army'' constitutional amendment was
favored by 35.6 percent, or 1,052,218 of those who cast ballots.
Opposed were 64.4 percent, or 1,903,797.
   Polls had predicted the proposal would win a maximum 30 percent
support.
   Voter turnout was 69 percent, the highest for a referendum since
the 1971 measure that gave women the right to vote.
   The government urged people to oppose the law, arguing that
Swiss neutrality and independence could only be guaranteed by a
credible defense force.
   Villiger said he did not regard the high number of votes in
favor of the proposal as a defeat. ``The relaxation of tension
which happily dominates the international scene was probably one
factor'' for the support, he told reporters.
   But supporters of the proposal were stunned by their success.
   ``The result is unbelievable,'' said Andreas Gross, spokesman
for the ``Switzerland Without an Army Group'' which collected the
100,000 signatures necessary to force the referendum.
   ``If 500,000 people can bring changes in Prague, then the high
proportion of yes votes should give the Swiss government food for
thought,'' he said, referring to the pro-democracy movement in
Czechoslovakia.
   The Social Democratic Party, describing the vote as
``sensational,'' called for an examination of defense policies. As
a priority, the law should be changed to allow conscientious
objectors to perform civilian duties, a statement from the party
said.
   Of the four parties in Switzerland's governing coalition, the
Social Democrats were alone in not urging rejection of the
proposal. They decided not to take a stand on the issue.
   The Swiss military establishment is rooted in centuries-old
tradition. Even though the country has not fought in foreign wars
since 1515, it can field more men per square mile than any other
country in the world apart from Israel.
   Switzerland has more artillery pieces than its much larger
neighbor West Germany and a fleet of battle tanks half that of
France.
   The Defense Ministry says military defense costs total about
$3.1 billion a year.
   Army opponents say costs are nearer $6.3 billion, taking into
account salaries in defense-related areas and the cost to
private-sector employers of releasing staff for the annual call-up.
   Currently, every Swiss man is required to do military service,
starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20, followed by 13
call-ups of two to three weeks until age 50. In a bid to relieve
pressure on the country's tight labor market, the defense ministry
this year announced reforms to end military service at the age of
42 by 1995.
   Before the vote, Villiger acknowledged that the unpopularity of
the compulsory basic recruit training was one of the reasons for
the high percentage of young people expected to support the no-army
initiative.
   In a recent survey of young recruits by a Swiss magazine, even
those who said they would vote against the proposal called for
reforms in military service. Many cited their dislike of blindly
following orders.
   The vote followed weeks of impassioned debate, rare in normally
reserved Switzerland.
   Supporters of the army maintained Switzerland's defense tactics
spared the country the horrors of involvement in World War II.
   Others argued Switzerland stayed neutral because it curried
Hitler's favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to the
Germans.
   In a second referendum Sunday, voters rejected by an
unexpectedly large majority of 62 percent a proposal to raise
national speed limits.
   The draft law aimed to raise the speed limit on highways from
120 to 130 kilometers per hour (75 to 81 mph) and on main roads
from 80 to 100 kilometers per hour (50 to 62 mph).

<HEAD>President Tells Aoun to Give Up or Else</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIBLI ABI ASSI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHTOURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly elected president Elias Hrawi said
Sunday he will replace Christian Gen. Michel Aoun with a new army
commander within 48 hours if Aoun continues to challenge the
fledgling government.
   The warning came after Parliament approved a new Cabinet that
pledged to extend its control over all Lebanon, including the
Christian enclave controlled by Aoun.
   ``If he (Aoun) persists ... I must say with much regret that he
will have to bear the consequences,'' Hrawi told reporters in this
Bekaa Valley town, wehre he has established temporary headquarters
while Aoun refuses to leave the official presidential palace.
   ``He still is the general of the army, perhaps for no more than
48 hours, after which, if he stays, he will become an officer of
this army,'' Hrawi said. ``You will know the name of the new
commander of the army by Wednesday morning.''
   Some parliamentarians speculated Hrawi would resort to military
means if Aoun was not forced out by diplomatic pressure.
   Hrawi, a 64-year-old Maronite, was elected Friday to succeed
President Rene Mouawad, who was assassinated Nov. 22 only 17 days
into his term.
   Hrawi put himself on a collision course with Aoun by dismissing
the general's military Cabinet before dawn Saturday and forming a
national unity government with members from Lebanon's seven major
sects.
   Aoun, asked Sunday on French television whether he would
surrender territory controlled by his 20,000 troops, said: ``No, I
will defend myself.''
   During the interview at his bunker in the presidential palace at
Baabda, Aoun speculated that Mouawad was killed because he refused
to order an attack on Aoun's forces.
   He denied responsibility for the assassination and said he sent
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to
help us discover who is the author'' of the killing.
   Parliament approved the new Cabinet during a session in the Park
Hotel in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley town of Chtoura, 23
miles east of Beirut. Hrawi has made temporary headquarters at the
hotel.
   All 43 deputies in attendance voted for the 14 men from all
major sects who will try to end the 14-year-old civil war.
   Addressing the session before the vote, Prime Minister Salim
Hoss pledged his government will seek to ``re-establish state
authority, law and order on all Lebanon's territory'' under an Arab
League-brokered peace plan endorsed by Parliament in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, Oct. 24.
   Aoun rejected the accord, which cleared the way for the
presidential election, because it did not guarantee a timetable for
the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   In an apparent warning to Aoun, Hoss pledged Sunday to
``mobilize all potential to remove the existing state of partition
along with all forms of lawlessness and mutiny. The government will
not permit any adventure that threatens the nation's existence.''
   It was not clear exactly how Hrawi and Hoss would go about
removing Aoun to head off final partition of the country. Aoun
commands the loyalty of a cohesive army that stands as the nation's
mightiest fighting machine.
   But his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians,
whose soldiers control 70 percent of Lebanese territory under a
1976 Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting.
   The consensus among deputies, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, was that the new government would try to remove Aoun by
political and diplomatic pressure.
   If that didn't work, Hrawi would order a military intervention
which Syria would support, they said.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, now public works minister, said
Sunday that Aoun ``will not leave easily.''
   Christian east Beirut and Aoun's Baabda palace were heavily
shelled during six months of fierce artillery battles between
Aoun's forces and the Syrian army. The fighting stopped with a
Sept. 22 cease-fire sponsored by the Arab League.
   Aoun, in the interview with French television, called the new
government a ``Syrian army attack on Baabda. The general is
preparing for the worst.''
   Hrawi said he was determined to rule from Baabda, the
traditional seat of presidents five miles east of the capital.
   ``Whatever is left of Baabda, even if it is only one room, when
this situation is over in east Beirut, it will be my residence,''
he said.
   ``We are not here to start another war, but if there is going to
be another explosion, it will only be for a few hours to finish
those to act without legality,'' he said.
   Most political analysts are convinced a military showdown is
inevitable if Hrawi seeks to evict Aoun from Baabda.
   The Taif accord provides for political reforms that give
Lebanon's Moslems, an estimated 55 percent of the population, an
equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Maronites, the
main Christian sect.
   The pact also outlines a phased withdrawal of Syria's 40,000
troops from major cities to the Bekaa within two years.

   After more than 40 years of Communist
rule, Hungarians voted freely Sunday on when and how to choose the
president of the new Hungarian republic.
   ``We wanted to take into our own hands the possibility to decide
on the people's future,'' said Imre Loerincz, a printer, after
voting.
   His words were echoed by many as they emerged from polling
stations set up in schools, hospitals and municipal buildings.
   ``After 40 years, it's high time'' people can vote freely on
issues important to them, said Erzsebet Nemere, a pensioner from a
working-class district of Budapest, the capital.
   State television said 53.6 percent of eligible voters in this
country of 10.6 million had cast ballots by late afternoon. Fifty
percent was needed for the referendum to be valid.
   Final results were expected sometime Monday or Tuesday.
   Election officials said many people were unfamiliar with voting
procedures and asked how to fill out the ballots. Some, still
conditioned from 40 years of one-party rule, even asked what
answers to give to the four questions on the ballot.
   The main issue was whether the first president of the new
republic should be chosen before or after free multiparty
parliamentary elections next year _ the first such elections since
the Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   The other three questions dealt with the ruling party's power:
whether the Workers' Militia, created to protect the Communists,
should be dissolved; whether the party should abolish its
representation at the workplace; and whether it should have to
account for its assets.
   Since the new republic was established Oct. 23 in a symbolic
rejection of Communist dominance, Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueros
has been acting president. The Socialist Party was created
following the dissolution of the Communist Party.
   The president commands the armed forces and can call elections
and dissolve Parliament.
   Parliament originally scheduled presidential elections this year
as part of an agreement between the ruling party and several
opposition groups.
   But the League of Free Democrats, the League of Young Democrats
and two other groups demanded the elections be held next year,
claiming the ruling party's candidate, Imre Pozsgay, would have an
advantage because he is already well known.
   They said the election should be put off until after the
parliamentary vote.
   The Socialists and other prominent opposition groups wanted the
president elected by direct vote before then.
   Many voters said they considered all four questions ``very
important,'' but some were cynical about the referendum.
   One man, currently unemployed, said many people he knew
considered the referendum ``ridiculous'' and did not intend to
vote. He declined to give his name.
   The referendum was marked by another first _ political
campaigning on television and radio.
   The four parties backing the postponed presidential election ran
TV spots each night for about 10 days before the vote at a cost of
$5,000 each for 15 seconds. The spots featured famous actors and
cultural figures.
   One spot showed a chick chipping through its shell and stepping
out into new life, saying, ``Vote for the future. Vote yes.''
   The Socialist Party also broadcast ads.
   The voting marked one of the first times voters in a Soviet bloc
country have gone to the polls in a binding nationwide referendum.
   In November 1987, the then-Communist government in Poland held a
referendum seeking public support for a radical program to make the
economy more market-oriented. Not enough people voted to make the
referendum law, although most of those who did cast ballots
supported the change.

<HEAD>Newsaper: `Miniskirt' Victim Skirted Truth in Trial, Interviews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose alleged rapist was
acquitted in part because jurors implied she invited the attack by
wearing scanty clothes may have misled authorities and
interviewers, The Miami Herald reported Sunday.
   An investigation by the Herald uncovered inconsistencies in the
woman's statements and behavior during the trial, suggesting that
she lied when she denied working as a prostitute and attributed her
income to a trust fund from her father.
   The case aroused a storm of indignation when comments from the
jurors were published after the Oct. 6 acquittal of Steven Lord,
who faces similar rape charges in Georgia.
   The jury foreman, Roy Diamond, said that because the woman was
wearing a white lace miniskirt and no panties at the time of the
incident, ``We all felt she was asking for it.''
   The controversy led to demonstrations and pickets in front of
the Broward County Courthouse. The foreman later said the furor was
based on a misunderstanding of his comment.
   ``It meant sex, not rape,'' Diamond said. ``People heard it and
they just took it for the worst.'' He said her outfit was ``a
factor'' in the decision, but said the reason the jury did not
believe her was her inconsistencies on the witness stand.
   The 22-year-old victim gave interviews under several different
pseudonyms, appearing on ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' and ``Larry King
Live.'' She was also paid $3,000 by the British newspaper The Mail
for her story, the Herald reported in its Tropic magazine.
   Among the inconsistencies raised in the article:
   _ On the witness stand, the woman strongly denied Lord's
testimony that she was a prostitute or had agreed to have sex for
$100 when Lord met her in a restaurant parking lot at 3 a.m. Tropic
found, however, that she had worked at three massage parlors and
tanning salons that were raided by vice officers, although she was
never arrested.
   Two colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity told the
newspaper the woman charged for sex both in and out of the salons.
   _ The woman explained her lack of employment by saying she had a
trust fund from her father, later claiming it had been looted by an
attorney. The attorney, Keith Nassetta, who faces similar charges
in other cases, says he never administered any trust fund for her.
   _ The woman testified she had spent the period before the 3 a.m.
incident with friends, but on the stand could not remember their
last names, how long she had spent with them or where they had gone.
   _ At the trial, she testified the first of several sexual
attacks occurred off the shoulder of Interstate 95. But she
initially told detective Tom White of the Indian River Sheriff's
Department that the first sex act occurred in a hotel parking lot _
as Lord had said.
   _ The woman at one point spent six days in jail after refusing
to honor subpoenas to testify in the case, and complained that she,
the victim, was being jailed instead of Lord. But police said she
gave them false names when they initially tried to serve subpoenas.
And check stubs showed she was working at a tanning salon _ and not
visiting California as she said _ at the time the subpoenas were
served. She shouted ``rape'' when officers handcuffed her to bring
her to jail, the Herald said.
   The woman refused to be interviewed for the story, the newspaper
said, but her attorney, Alexander Siegel, angrily denied Sunday
that his client is a prostitute.
   ``It's all innuendo,'' Siegel said. ``There's nothing in there
about my client, because there is nothing about my client. It's
character assassination done out of malice.''

   Leonard B. Boudin, a civil liberties lawyer who
represented many prominent liberals and radicals and whose
daughter, now in jail, belonged to the radical Weather Underground,
has died at the age of 77.
   He died at St. Vincent's Hospital late Friday after a heart
attack.
   Boudin also represented one-time Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa
when he was banned from labor activities as a condition of his
prison release. He represented Cuba's interests in the United
States for the last 30 years and the Central Bank of Iran during
the Iran hostage crisis.
   His daughter, Kathy Boudin, 46, is serving a 20-year term in
state prison. She pleaded guilty to a murder charge for her
involvement in a 1981 Rockland County armored truck robbery in
which a guard and two police officers were killed.
   Before the robbery, Ms. Boudin had been wanted for questioning
about a 1970 bomb explosion in Greenwich Village that killed three
members of the Weather Underground, a militant offshoot of the
Students for a Democratic Society.
   Boudin defended many controversial clients involved in civil
liberties issues, including singer-actor Paul Robeson and Daniel
Ellsberg, who was charged with theft in connection with the
Pentagon Papers, classified documentation of the history of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
   He also represented Julian Bond, who was denied a seat in the
Georgia House of Representatives because of his opposition to the
Vietnam War, and Benjamin Spock, who was charged with conspiracy to
violate the Selective Service Act.
   In Boudin's best known legal victory, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in 1958 in Kent vs. Dulles that the State Department cannot
withhold passports for political reasons.
   In the late 1940s, Boudin and another lawyer, Victor Rabinowitz,
started their own labor law firm. They moved into civil liberties
law when an early provision of the Taft-Hartley Act forced union
leaders to swear under oath they were not Communists.
   Boudin was a visiting lecturer at the law schools of Harvard,
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
   He is survived by his wife, Jean Roisman, his daughter, a son, a
brother and four grandchildren.

   Aliens who commit serious crimes _ including
murder, rape and drug trafficking _ are a growing problem that is
already draining law enforcement resources and threatening public
safety, officials say.
   The main problem, say congressional and administration
officials, is a lengthy deportation process that enables released
convicts to commit new crimes while their immigration cases are
pending, a failure to control illegal immigration, or misplaced
priorities within the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The result, says Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, is ``that we're
taking about a massive problem, with potentially hundreds of
thousands of illegal aliens (in the country) who have committed
crimes.''
   Smith is ranking Republican on the House Judiciary subcommittee
on immigration, refugees and international law.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, the subcommittee chairman, says the country
is ``overwhelmed'' with hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens,
yet the INS is only deporting a fraction of them.
   ``The priorities there (at INS) do not seem to be clear at
all,'' said Morrison, D-Conn. ``You really can't be allowing a
large number of people who have committed crimes to remain (in the
country). It makes a joke out of the system.''
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said the agency has increased its
deportations of criminal aliens _ those either convicted or accused
of a crime _ yet is bound by the law, which gives most criminal
aliens the right to a full review of their cases in immigration
court pending deportation. An alien can prolong a deportation for
at least a year and sometimes two years.
   During that time, Austin said, aliens have been known to commit
new crimes and end up back in prison. According to Austin, there
are only 60 immigration judges nationwide handling thousands of
cases. And there is only one board to consider appeals from
decisions made by those 60 judges.
   Although the system may be abused in some cases, an immigration
rights activist says it protects everyone's right to due process.
   ``There are lots of people who are legally entitled to be in the
country, and who but for that process might be forcibly evicted,''
said Charles Kamasaki, vice president for research, advocacy and
legislation for National Council of La Raza.
   There also are those aliens, who with little English proficiency
or poor legal representation, are convicted of crimes yet ``by no
stretch of the imagination are criminals,'' Kamasaki said.
   According to Smith, whose San Antonio district borders Mexico,
aliens now account for 20 percent of the federal prison population.
   ``If we think the 20 percent figure is high, what's worse is
that seven out of eight (criminal) aliens are either released or
given probation and never serve time in prison,'' Smith said.
   Smith said more than 72,000 aliens will be arrested every year
on drug charges alone. In Texas, the state spends $115,000 to house
approximately 3,500 alien inmates in its prisons.
   ``The problem of aliens who commit serious crimes like murder,
rape and drug dealing has escalated, along with expanded drug
trafficking and the number of aliens in the U.S.,'' Smith said.
``By any account, the problem of criminal aliens is large and
growing.''
   Apprehensions of criminal aliens _ those referred to INS by
local law enforcement _ have more than doubled in five years _ from
22,000 in fiscal 1985 to 51,154 in 1989.
   Deportations of criminal aliens jumped from 4,711 in 1987 to
6,072 in 1988 to 41,824 in fiscal 1989, Austin said.
   Austin said he agrees the problem of criminal aliens has been
increasing in recent years. ``It's growing in relation to the
illegal flow of aliens into the United States.''
   But Kamasaki says the issue tends to be exaggerated and
overstated, ``in the sense that when you consider the total number
of persons coming into the country ... the number of persons
committing a crime in proportion to the 10 million (aliens who
enter annually) is extraordinarily small.''
   Kamasaki said politicians can always score quick points bashing
criminals, aliens, or criminal aliens.
   ``For a politician on the lookout for a cheap way to score some
political points, the subject _ even the title, `criminal aliens,'
is like a gold mine. But its really a very minor problem in the
context of crime overall,'' he said.
   And the problem of aliens involved in the drug trade, he said,
is more a drug problem than an immigration problem.
   ``There does appear to be a large and growing problem of
importation of drugs from certain countries, but you don't solve
that through immigration law, but with regular law enforcement,''
Kamasaki said.

   A man who has searched for his
missing daughter since February is channeling his energy and
marketing expertise to help families of other missing people _ and
keep his daughter's case in the spotlight.
   Patrick Sessions, 43, a wealthy real estate developer, mounted a
nationwide search for his daughter after she disappeared near the
University of Florida in Gainesville.
   Tiffany Sessions, 20, went for a walk on Feb. 9 near her
apartment and told her roommate she would be back in an hour.
   National newspapers picked up the story of her father's
dedicated hunt, tabloid television covered it, and Sessions
appeared on syndicated talk shows.
   He has gathered what he learned from his ordeal into a 50-page
manual on how to search for a missing person. The manual will be
published early next year by the Adam Walsh Foundation, and
Sessions said the booklet will be made available to any one who
needs it.
   He said the National Foundation for Missing Persons distributes
a pamphlet with information about missing people, but it is not as
how-to oriented as his publication.
   ``This book really tells you what to do immediately following
the disappearance,'' said Sessions, whose search was as organized
as a sales plan for the subdivisions his company builds. He said he
wished he had such a checklist of steps to follow when his daughter
vanished.
   The manual tells people how to work with local police, what
makes a successful flier and how to distribute such material into
the right hands.
   Sessions handed out hundreds of thousands of fliers to everyone
from mail carriers to law enforcement agencies across the country.
   He has upped his reward for information about his daughter from
$75,000 to $250,000 and plans to mail them to police agencies and
medical examiners every 90 days.
   ``That way they won't forget her,'' he said.
   Sessions has posted his daughter's picture on billboards, pizza
boxes and in newspaper ads. Wayne Black, a private investigator who
has been assisting in the search, said Sessions had come up with
many innovative ways to search for Tiffany.
   ``He came up with the idea to give her picture to mailmen,''
Black said. ``Mailmen go to every house in the community.''
   Another idea of Sessions was the billboard campaign, which has
evolved into a statewide program to help track other missing
children.
   That campaign, supported by corporate donations, posts a photo
of the missing person on a billboard along with a toll-free number.
Each month, a different missing child will be featured. The
billboards cost $7,500 a month.
   Arvida-JMB Partners is sponsoring the first 100 billboards.
Sessions is president of the Weston division of Arvida,
headquartered in Boca Raton, Fla.
   But none of this has led to Tiffany, and Black said the case has
been the most difficult of his investigative career.
   A toll-free 800 hotline rings daily in Sessions office with
reports of sightings. Black said every lead is followed up, even
those from psychics.
   And while most callers mean well, others' motives are less
honorable. A Gainesville man pleaded guilty Nov. 13 in a scheme to
extort more than $200,000 from Sessions. He faces up to 20 years in
prison and $40,000 in fines.
   Sessions saw a silver lining in the extortion incident _ it kepy
Tiffany's name and picture in the news.
   He says he's afraid his daughter might have been a victim of a
serial killer.
   ``I thought when I raised the reward money to $250,000, someone
would have ratted on someone.''
   Session's manual is dedicated to Tiffany: ``Wherever you are,
may you always remember that I love you and will keep up the
search.''

   A collie named Katie gets a shampoo, while
a Lhasa Apso called Su Chi gets the tangles cut from her long
tresses. Then there's a chubby Rottweiler dubbed Bubbette in the
dog dryer.
   They're all being primped and groomed by their owners at the
``do-it-yourself dog wash.''
   ``We think it's just a new lifestyle for dogs,'' said John Cole,
58, who just opened the third Little Dipper Do-it-Yourself Pet Care
Center in Austin.
   Cole launched his pet-washing spot in 1987, after Austin's
economic crunch battered his real estate investments and hurt
business at his privacy-fencing company.
   A veteran hunter, Cole had years of experience washing and
dipping his German short hair pointers _ and he decided it was far
too much trouble.
   ``I'd come back to South Texas with a trailer full of dirty
dogs,'' he said. ``We started to look at the pet industry and
decided it needed something new.''

   A husband-wife team from Minot State
University propose turning New Jersey into a giant parking lot and
airport to alleviate crime and urban stress on the East Coast.
   Stephen and Barbara Ragan's idea of making New Jersey into an
``International Parkade'' is a whimsical parody of a proposal by
two Rutgers University professors in New Jersey to turn the Great
Plains into a giant buffalo preserve.
   ``I think it's partially serious,'' Ragan said, although much of
their 11-page ``scholarly paper'' is clearly comedy. ``It was meant
to be fun, and it has been fun. I learned some things about New
Jersey _ it's worse than I thought.''
   The Ragans _ he's a professor in special education and she is an
English Department lecturer _ call for New Jersey's 7 million
residents to be relocated to the Plains. There would be five
mega-airports with rail service to nearby cities.
   The buffalo idea was broached by Frank Popper, a Rutgers urban
studies professor, and his wife, Deborah.

   Word of the Safedisk spread after television talk-show host
Arsenio Hall tittered over them. The two plastic covers fit two
sizes of floppy disks.
   Stephen Nabity of Fremont _ ``Dr. Safedisk'' _ said he got the
idea while watching a TV newscast about a predicted outbreak of
computer viruses on Friday, Oct. 13.
   ``It came to me that people should practice safe
whatever-they-do _ a lot of computer viruses were going around,''
said Nabity, 33.
   His product doesn't don't actually protect against computer
viruses, but they can be an inexpensive stocking-stuffer _ at $7.95
_ for computer buffs who can be hard to buy for, Nabity said.

<HEAD>Palestinian Activists Begin Paramilitary Patrols in Nablus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groups of Palestinian activists armed with
assault rifles have begun organized patrols in the West Bank city
of Nablus to search for Palestinians they suspect of collaborating
with Israel, Arab reporters said Sunday.
   Members of two underground Palestinian gangs have been seen at
least twice patrolling alleys of Nablus' Old City, carrying lists
of suspected collaborators and questioning people, said the
reporters, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, meanwhile, proposed to annex parts
of the occupied lands with dense Jewish settlements as a prelude to
the Israeli-offered Palestinian elections.
   The hawkish Sharon, a leading opponent of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir in the right-wing Likud bloc, said on Israel army radio that
otherwise, ``elections, in the form offered by our plan, would lead
to a Palestinian state.''
   Also Sunday, a riot erupted outside military court in the West
Bank town of Ramallah, reportedly after Palestinian detainees spit
and cursed at Israeli soldiers.
   A spokesman said soldiers used ``reasonable force'' to quell the
riot. He added that one soldier threw a grenade into a bus carrying
the detainees in order to deter them. The national news agency Itim
said soldiers beat the detainees with clubs and rifle butts.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 13 Palestinians were
reported shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers. The army said
it was checking reports of injuries.
   In Nablus, Arab reporters said gangs called the Black Panthers
and the Red Eagles began patrols through the Nablus casbah, or
market, late last week.
   In one case, the youths showed a Palestinian reporter a list
with at least 15 names of people suspected of cooperating with
Israel or committing moral offenses such as drug dealing or
prostitution.
   Palestinians have killed 150 of their fellow Arabs on such
charges during the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising. The toll
includes at least 23 murders in Nablus.
   The army has blamed the Red Eagles, loosely affiliated with the
Marxist PLO faction Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
for at least nine slayings.
   In some cases, Palestinians were tortured before they were
killed and their bodies were displayed in public as a warning to
local residents of the penalty for cooperating with Israel, the
army said.
   On Nov. 9, soldiers burst into a Nablus house where the Red
Eagles were believed hiding, gunning down an armed Palestinian
youth who was described as a commander of the group and arresting
five others, the military said.
   Arab reporters in Nablus say the army raid did not stop the
group.
   On Thursday, a lone man approached a woman shopping in a busy
market street and shot her in the head in full view of dozens of
shoppers. Later, members of the Black Panthers threatened to carry
out further slayings of alleged collaborators.
   On Saturday, the group kidnapped two Palestinians from the
Balata refugee camp and only released them after a severe beating,
Arab reporters said.
   The Black Panthers were initially affiliated with Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of the PLO, but they have ignored
direct radio messages from Arafat to stop the killings unless they
have specific orders.
   Neither group wears a uniform, but the Black Panthers wear
silver necklaces saying ``Al-Fahd al-Aswad,'' Arabic for ``black
panther,'' and the Red Eagles drape a red Palestinian headdress
around their shoulders.

   The brief marriage of Marilyn Monroe and Joe

auction block.
   The bed's owner said the hand-carved English oak bed once
occupied the master bedroom in the Beverly Hills home that the
screen star and baseball legend rented during their eight-month
marriage in 1954.
   It's on display at Regal Antiques of Ho-Ho-Kus, and the minimum
bid is $25,000. Shop owner June Regal says it's not a bad price for
a piece of furniture with such star quality.
   ``After all, Judy Garland's ruby slippers sold for $165,000 and
a Marilyn Monroe brassiere sold for $1,200,'' Ms. Regal said.
   ``When you have a bed, you have the soul of a marriage. This is
where it's taken place, and we're talking about two of the most
exciting and sad and happy and wonderful people of our century,''
Ms. Regal said.
   Sealed bids will be opened next month, Ms. Regal said.

   More than one in five college men use
snuff or chewing tobaco, nearly twice the number who smoke,
according to a nationwide survey.
   ``Smokeless tobacco is a serious problem in American colleges
and universities,'' said Elbert D. Glover, a Penn State University
professor of health education who conducted the study. ``Unless we
do something, by the year 2000 (or) 2010, we're going to experience
an oral cancer epidemic.''
   A 1986 surgeon general's report said smokeless tobacco plays a
role in tooth cavities, gum disease and oral cancer and is believed
to have the same addictive potential as cigarettes.
   Of the 5,894 college or university students participating in
Glover's study, 22 percent of the men said they dipped or chewed
tobacco, compared to 13 percent who said they smoked.
   Among the college or university women surveyed, 2 percent said
they used snuff or chewing tobacco, while 16 percent said they
smoked.
   Glover, director of the Center for Tobacco Studies at Penn
State, said the recent survey is the first national study of
smokeless tobacco use among college students. The center is not
supported by the tobacco industry.
   An estimated 50 million people smoke in the United States while
an estimated 12 million use smokeless tobacco.
   Chewing or dipping tobacco is most prevalent in the
south-central and southwestern states where 28 percent and 27
percent of college men used smokeless tobacco, Glover's survey
found.
   In the Northeast, only 15 percent of college men used the
tobacco products, while 16 percent used them in central states,
according to the survey.
   Snuff, which is cured, ground tobacco, is placed in pinchfuls
between the cheek and gums, called dipping. Chewing tobacco, sold
in packets of leaf, plug or twists, is placed in wads in the cheek.
   Glover said most people think smokeless tobacco as a safe
alternative to smoking. Nearly eight of 10 of the students
surveyed, 79 percent, believed chewing or dipping was less harmful
than smoking.
   ``You're just trading off different kinds of cancer,'' Glover
said. ``Obviously, if you chew your chance of lung cancer goes way
down. But your chance of oral cancer goes way up.''
   Glover found 90 percent of those students surveyed agreed
smokeless tobacco ``harms the mouth'' and 80 percent said it
``causes cancer.''
   But only 14 percent agreed smokeless tobacco is ``very
harmful,'' while 79 percent believe it is ``somewhat harmful'' or
``slightly harmful.''
   Demand for snuff and chewing tobacco among young men has been
strengthened by the products' masculine image, Glover said, in part
because they are popular among professional athletes.
   He said the amount of chewing tobacco consumed nationally
increased 22 percent annually from the 1970s until 1986-87 when it
declined slightly.
   Glover conducted the research by distributing surveys in spring
1987 to schools with 2,000 students or more in eight states picked
randomly from eight regions in the country. The questionnaires were
distributed at physical education classes.
   The states where the survey were distributed were Ohio,
Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, Connecticut and
South Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's premier, Ladislav
Adamec, has emerged as a central figure in the political ferment
triggered by massive demonstrations against Communist one-party
rule.
   Adamec's clever political maneuvering and clean background
helped build an image that made the 63-year-old veteran Communist
acceptable to the opposition as a negotiating partner. He was not
involved in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   Adamec drew both cheers and jeers from hundreds of thousands
when he joined opposition speakers at a rally Sunday, hours after
greeting dissident playwright Vaclav Havel with a historic
handshake at a closed-door meeting with the opposition.
   There seemed little doubt that he had maneuvered himself into a
position that could be decisive in helping find a way out of the
current crisis.
   A graduate of the Communist Party College and Prague's
University of Economics, Adamec was little known until he was named
head of the federal government 13 months ago.
   At an early stage, Adamec came out cautiously against repressing
dissent. ``Those who are blind and deaf to criticism have no right
to hold a leading position,'' he said shortly before taking office.
   He lived up to his words when he broke with the Communist
leadership in accepting a meeting last week with opposition
representatives.
   But hopes that he would lead a changeover in the party were
bashed after a party Central Committee meeting Friday.
   It was announced then that he had submitted his resignation late
last month both from the premiership and from the party's ruling
Politburo.
   Unconfirmed reports said his decision to quit followed growing
frustration with the orthodox policies of party chief Milos Jakes
and his associates. Most of them were demoted at the same Central
Committee meeting.
   ``There is no doubt that this (situation) could turn into a
dangerous conflict,'' Adamec warned the committee in a speech
released Sunday by the state-run news agency CTK. ``I am against
any onesidedness in political evaluation of forces which have
started to move ahead.''
   No permanent new premier has been named, leaving Adamec in
office for the time being and allowing him to defy the party
leadership's position of refusing contacts with the opposition.
   ``We made a positive assessment of Adamec's abilities,'' a
spokesman of the main opposition group, Civic Forum, told a weekend
news conference. He said so far, Adamec was the only one in the
leadership acceptable as a partner in a dialogue.
   On Sunday, the crowd chanted Adamec's name when he joined
Alexander Dubcek, leader of the crushed Prague Spring reform
movement, and opposition leaders in giving a speech.
   But he was booed when he suggested that a two-hour general
strike called by the opposition Monday be limited instead to two
minutes to prevent damage to the economy.
   ``It does not make much difference,'' observed one Czechoslovak
listener. ``Most people don't work anyway between noon and 2 p.m.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of
Poland led a prayer service Sunday in a snow-covered forest where
4,300 Polish officers were killed during World War II in a massacre
most Poles blame on the Soviets.
   Night had already fallen when Mazowiecki's voice sounded through
the forest 400 miles east of the Polish border.
   ``Let them lie in peace,'' he said as he stood in front of a
26-foot-tall wooden cross that marks the site of the slayings.
   For Mazowiecki and other members of his Solidarity-led
government, the Roman Catholic Mass at Katyn during their first
visit to the Soviet Union was a national obligation.
   In a speech at a Kremlin dinner on Friday, Mazowiecki said that
in order for there to be true friendship between the two nations,
the full story of the massacre must be told. In August, Mazowiecki
formed the first East bloc government not led by Communists, a move
the Soviets sanctioned.
   Mazowiecki told a Moscow news conference that he raised the
issue of Katyn when he met Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Friday.
   The Polish leader said, ``Mikhail Gorbachev knows the meaning
this has for us, and we expect a clarification of this problem will
occur.''
   Mazowiecki laid a wreath in front of a long stone monument which
pays tribute to the Polish officers. The momument says, ``To the
victims of fascism, Polish officers shot by Hitlerites in 1941.''
   The Soviets still maintain the men were slain by the Nazis when
Hitler's army marched on Moscow. But most Poles and Western
historians believe the Soviet secret police massacred the officers
in the spring of 1940. Each man was killed with a single bullet to
the back of the head.
   With Poland in the Soviet orbit after World War II, it was taboo
to speak openly in Poland about Soviet responsibility until the
1980s, when the birth of Solidarity created a climate of openness.
   Recently, the Soviets, whose reforms have led to dramatic
political changes in Eastern Europe, have allowed Poles to travel
to Katyn. Earlier this year, a large wooden cross was erected
during a visit by Polish Primate Jozef Glemp.
   ``The victory is that we are here. It's a victory for us in
Poland and for those trying to organize a new life here,'' said
Aleksander Hauke-Ligowski, who led the Mass on Sunday.
   In the city of Smolensk, 17 miles from Katyn, a half-dozen local
human rights activists demonstrated their solidarity with the
Polish view of history. ``Open the truth about Katyn'' said one
banner. ``Mr. Mazowiecki, the Democratic Society of Smolensk
Welcomes You,'' said another.
   As members of Mazowiecki's delegation chatted in Russian with
the demonstrators, plainclothes police looked on but did not
interfere.
   Mazowiecki was accompanied by Soviet Vice Minister Nikolai
Larionov during the daylong visit to Zagorsk, Smolensk and finally
Katyn.
   During a visit to the monastery of Zagorsk, where Mazowiecki
knelt several times in silent prayer, he praised the Russian
Orthodox Church as a keeper of wisdom in the Soviet Union.
   A joint Soviet-Polish historical commission established by
Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1987 to
clear up historical blank spots has yet to deliver a final verdict
on the Katyn controversy.
   However, earlier this year the Polish side of the commission
concluded there is no reasonable doubt the Soviets were responsible.
   More than 15,000 Polish officers deported to three camps in the
Soviet Union in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II were never
heard from after the spring of 1940. The Katyn bodies were found by
the Germans in 1943, but traces of the other 11,000 men have never
been found.
   Mazowiecki was to travel to Leningrad on Monday from Moscow to
conclude his five-day Soviet visit.

   Although fame and fortune have brightened the
future of Michael J. Fox, the ``Back to the Future'' actor does
admit success has a dark side.
   ``After Rebecca Schaeffer was killed, people said, `Doesn't that
scare you?' Of course it scares me,'' Fox said, referring to the
actress who was gunned down, allegedly by a disturbed fan.
   ``But I'm not lunatic about it,'' Fox said in the Dec. 4 issue
of People magazine. ``We lock the doors like everybody else. But
who wants to live in a cocoon?''
   Last year, while Fox was shooting ``Casualties of War'' on
location in Thailand, his wife, Tracy Pollan, began receiving
threatening letters. The woman who allegedly wrote them is now in a
California psychiatric facility awaiting trial on five counts of
making terroristic threats.
   ``You can't just shrug it off and say, `Well, I'm a celebrity.
It comes with the territory,''' Fox said.
   Fox says he has hired bodyguards, but adds: ``It's key that you
live a normal life as possible. I don't subscribe to the theory
that you surround yourself with a phalanx of meat and guns.''

   William C. Murphy, an uncle of Vice President
Dan Quayle and a former executive of Eli Lilly and Co., has died at
the age of 67.
   Murphy, married to a sister of Quayle's mother, died Wednesday.
He had been hospitalized with a heart ailment.
   Quayle press secretary Dave Beckwith said Sunday that the vice
president would attend a memorial service Monday at the Fourth
Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, Md., but did not think he would go
to the burial at Franklin, Ind.
   Quayle had been scheduled to address the National League of
Cities meeting Monday in Atlanta, but cancelled that because of his
uncle's death.
   Murphy was manager of Lilly's public information department in
Indianapolis before going to Washington, where he directed Lilly's
public relations office from 1964 until he retired in 1975.
   He received a Brookings Institute Fellowship in Washington in
January 1964.
   After his retirement, he continued to work for the
Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company through his own firm,
Murphy and Associates.
   During World War II, Murphy piloted 33 missions over Europe in
B-17 bombers.
   Survivors include his wife, Suzanne Pulliam Murphy, whose sister
Corinne Pulliam Quayle is the vice president's mother.

   The case against a Massachusetts state
police trooper charged with rape and attempted extortion may be
jeopardized by a lack of money to pay a stenographer, the defense
attorney said.
   John C. McBride, lawyer for suspended Trooper Robert Monteiro,
said he plans to file a motion to have the charges dismissed
because he is unable to get the transcript of grand jury
proceedings involving Monteiro.
   The grand jury stenographer has refused to produce any more
minutes of jury testimony until she is paid, but the chief
administrative judge's office and the Middlesex County District
Attorney's office say they haven't got the necessary funds.
   Superior Court Judge James McHugh said in court Tuesday he was
``frustrated that court proceedings are coming to a halt because
funds are not available to conduct the court's business.''
   ``It threatens a case involving significant public interest, as
well as others,'' McHugh said. ``It is absolutely impossible for
the defense or the prosecution to proceed without grand jury
minutes. They are constitutionally required and can't be produced.''
   Monteiro, 25, is charged with stopping four female motorists on
the Massachusetts Turnpike, raping two of them and trying to extort
sexual favors from the other two in return for neglecting to issue
traffic tickets. He was arraigned Sept. 5 on the rape charges.
   Deborah Christerson, who runs Christerson Court Reporting, the
firm that records and transcribes all county grand jury minutes,
said she will no longer provide transcripts until she was paid for
past work.
   According to The Boston Sunday Globe, Christerson is reportedly
owed for at least two months of work.
   Christerson has declined to comment on the matter.
   Edward Rapacki, first assistant district attorney for Middlesex
County, said his office would be willing to pay for the transcripts
if the state Legislature provided the money.
   The Monteiro case is scheduled back before McHugh on Friday, and
the judge has indicated he will rule under a state law that gives
him power to appoint a stenographer and order that copies of grand
jury minutes be made and paid for by the state.

   The Navy's comprehensive safety review has
resulted in the reassignment of the skipper of a San Diego-based
destroyer following a collision two weeks ago off Malaysia that
killed one and injured five others.
   The Navy said Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, skipper of the Kinkaid,
was relieved of duty Friday by Vice Adm. H.H. Mauz, head of the 7th
fleet, and temporarily assigned to Mauz's office in Japan.
   The Kinkaid's navigator was killed and five crew members were
injured when the destroyer collided with a freighter Nov. 12 in the
Straits of Malacca off the coast of Malaysia. The collision left a
15-by-56-foot hole above the waterline in the side of the destroyer.
   Two days after the Kincaid's collision and a series of other
serious accidents, the Navy announced an unprecedented safety
review of all operations, halting normal activities for two days.

<HEAD>Soviets Launch Module With Space Motorcycle, But Solar Panel Stuck</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Tass announcing technical problems with

<TEXT>
   After months of delay, the Soviet Union on Sunday
launched an attachment for its orbiting space station Mir that
features a ``space motorcycle'' and an experiment with Japanese
quail eggs.
   However, the official Tass news agency rapidly reported
technical problems with the Kvant-2 module, saying one of the two
panels of its solar battery did not open fully, and that scientists
considered what to do next.
   Soviet television broadcast live the nighttime launch of the
Proton booster rocket carrying the module from the sprawling
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,560 miles southeast of Moscow in the desert
steppe of Kazakhstan.
   The Kvant-2 features a shower and sink, an airlock for
spacewalks and an incubator in which Japanese quail eggs are to be
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity. Also
aboard the module is a ``space motorcycle,'' which looks more like
a floating armchair.
   After the module docks with Mir on Dec. 2, mission commander
Alexander S. Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov will
test the device outside. It is designed for repairing satellites
and rescuing cosmonauts in distress.
   Tass said the two cosmonauts, who blasted off Sept. 5, are
``impatiently waiting for the module'' because its launch had been
delayed twice. It was originally scheduled to blast off in April,
but it wasn't ready then, and a second launching planned for
mid-September was scrapped because of problems with its electronic
docking system.
   Exactly what effect on the mission the non-deployment of one of
the solar battery panels could have was not spelled out by Tass.
   ``The data obtained (from telemetry) are now being analyzed,''
it said. ``A decision will be taken on the results of this
analysis.''
   It was the latest snafu in the Soviet space program. Two twin
multimillion-dollr unmanned probes to Mars were lost in flight last
year, and in the past year almost every manned mission has had
technical problems on landing.
   The 20-ton Mir was designed to be permanently manned, and it was
the site of a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts last year.
   But it was unexpectedly mothballed in April because the Kvant-2
and another add-on were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would
have cost money when lawmakers and ordinary Soviets wanted rubles
spent on Earth.
   The four-month vacancy was only the second time since Mir was
launched in February 1986 that it was unmanned.
   Mir already is joined with the Kvant astrophysics laboratory.
   Another module, scheduled for attachment later, features a
telescopic camera for studying the stars, a docking port to link
with the space shuttle Buran, and equipment to grow vegetables and
crystals for electronics.
   Viktorenko, 42, and Serebrov, 45, are to return to Earth in
early March after a replacement crew arrives on the Mir.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev displayed solid support
Sunday for reform in Eastern Europe by endorsing socialism with a
``human face'' _ the slogan used by the Czechoslovak progressives
toppled by a Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   In the Czechoslovak capital, Alexander Dubcek, leader of the
ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 21 years ago, read
Gorbachev's remarks at a rally as proof of the Soviet president's
backing for change.
   Two days earlier, the Czechoslovak Communist Party dumped party
chief Milos Jakes and some other leaders associated with hard-line
policies in an attempt to stem the political crisis that has rocked
the country.
   With the East bloc in upheaval, the Soviet Communist Party daily
Pravda published a 2{-page compilation of Gorbachev's thoughts on
the future of socialism and his own program for ``perestroika,'' or
reconstruction of the economy and society.
   Pravda said the article was a synthesis of recent remarks by
Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader's major theme seemed to be that socialism must
modernize _ even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary _ or risk
becoming irrelevant. He offered no quick answers but said the
process would take years, ``into the 21st century.''
   He also said achievements attained under capitalism, like
``equality of all before the law'' and general prosperity, should
not be dismissed because of ideology.
   ``In the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation with
capitalism, we clearly underestimate the importance of much that
has been done by humanity over the centuries,'' the Kremlin leader
said.
   On the need for Soviet reform, Gorbachev said: ``The people are
tired of waiting.
   ``Many words have been spoken about the interests of man, but
they have been little reinforced with material resources and
genuine deeds. As a result, in becoming a great and mighty power,
the country did not create for the masses of the people the
conditions of life that are natural for any civilized state.''
   ``The new face of socialism is its human face, this fully
corresponds to the thought of Marx,'' Gorbachev said. ``Because its
creation is the chief goal of restructuring, we can with full
justification say we are building humanitarian socialism.''
   For Communists, the phrase ``socialism with a human face'' is
inseparably linked to Dubcek and his ill-fated reform movement.
Gorbachev has previously supported economic and social reform in
Eastern Europe and pledged the Soviets would not interfere there,
but by appropriating Dubcek's words, he made his point dramatically.
   Some in Prague even took Gorbachev's comments as a public
admission that the 1968 intervention, which led to Dubcek's
overthrow, was a mistake. The Soviet Union has not yet renounced
the 1968 intervention, as it has the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
   As recently as last year, the Kremlin was vigorously defending
the intervention in Czechoslovakia as necessary to block
``anti-socialist forces.'' Soviets also avoided any comparisons
between what Dubcek tried to do and perestroika. ``The difference
is 20 years,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov once
said laconically.
   In the Pravda article, Gorbachev sounded a note of alarm about
socialism by contrasting its present woes with the adaptibility of
capitalism.
   Karl Marx was wrong, Gorbachev acknowledged, when he predicted
capitalism's imminent demise.
   ``Unfortunately, socialism has not been able to occupy the
leader's position in structural reconversion _ industrially
developed capitalist countries have apppeared in this role,''
Gorbachev said.
   He said much of value was created under capitalism _ ``not just
simple norms of morality and justice, but principles of formal law,
i.e. equality of all before the law, laws and liberties of the
individual, principles of the production of goods and equivalent
exchange based on the law of value.''
   Gorbachev defended the 1917 revolution that brought the
Communists to power in the former Russian Empire as a
``world-historical breakthrough to the future,'' but said socialism
has often been perverted since.
   ``For the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism, human
individuality was ignored, the development of the personality was
slowed,'' he said.
   He also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they lack a
clear blueprint, citing the precedent of Soviet founder Vladimir
Lenin.
   ``There is a deep-seated belief that Lenin supposedly had a
completed program for the development of socialism in our country.
But in fact he had no such completed program,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Will Be Putting On High-Speed Airs At UT-Arlington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the University of Texas at
Arlington are putting final touches on a new high-speed wind tunnel
that is intended to boost the development of commuter space travel.
   The facility, expected to be in use next month, is being built
to support development of the National Aero-Space Plane, an
experimental aircraft being designed by government and industry
scientists to fly at up to 25 times the speed of sound.
   The aircraft would be able to take and land at conventional
airports, using air-breathing engines to climb through most of the
atmosphere and then switching to rockets to reach Earth orbit.
   Supporters believe the program will eventually lead to aircraft
that can fly from one side of the globe to the other in two or
three hours.
   The speed of sound is about 761 mph at sea level, and officials
say the UT-Arlington wind tunnel will generate brief bursts of air
up to 18 times that fast, far faster than most conventional test
facilities and far greater than the top speeds of conventional
aircraft.
   Frank Lu, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at
UTA, said scientists will use the wind tunnel to conduct basic
research to see how air flows around aircraft that travel at
hypersonic speeds, five times the speed of sound or more.
   ``With hypersonic, we really don't know too much,'' Lu said.
``We know the interactions will be very severe.''
   The research and development phase of the space-plane program is
expected to run through 1992, when federal officials will decide
whether to build two test planes.
   The new wind tunnel at UT-Arlington cost $200,000, not including
about $150,000 worth of test-chamber equipment donated by the LTV
Corp., according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

   A storm that had dumped more than 3 feet of snow on some
mountains battered a wide area of the West with snow, rain and high
wind Sunday and forced cancellation of a major skiing competition.
   At midday, snow was falling over eastern Washington state,
northern and eastern Idaho, western Montana, western Wyoming and
northeastern Nevada, with heavy snow over parts of Utah.
   The storm had piled up 38 inches of snow near Donner Summit in
California's Sierra Nevada range near Lake Tahoe, and elsewhere in
the Sierra 30 inches had accumulated at Sierra Ski Ranch, with 24
at Ebbetts Pass and 21 inch es at Alpine Meadows.
   Jackson, Wyo., had 14 inches and 10 inches had fallen in
Yellowstone National Park.
   Wind gusted to 53 mph at Cedar City, Utah, and 45 mph at Page,
Ariz.
   Elsewhere in Utah, blizzard conditions and ice shut down
westbound Interstate 80 Sunday morning from Kimball Junction west
of Park City, to the summit in Parley's canyon about 15 miles east
of Salt Lake, the Utah Highway Patrol said.
   ``The summit was impassable, there were cars all over the
road,'' said motorist John Jelte.
   At the nearby Park City Ski Area, high wind, lightning and heavy
snow made it impossible for skiers to compete in the men's slalom
on the final day of the four-day World Cup ski races.
   ``It's just not safe to be up on that hill,'' said resort
spokesman Mark Menlove.
   An avalanche warning was issued in the mountains east of Salt
Lake City, where a foot of new snow accompanied by high wind
created unstable conditions in undeveloped areas above 9,000 feet.
   Rain was scattered from south-central Wyoming across central
Colorado, northern Utah, along the southern coast of California,
and over central South Dakota.
   Winter storm watches were posted into Monday over southeastern
North Dakota, South Dakota, most of Minnesota, northwestern through
north-central Iowa and northern Wisconsin.
   Elsewhere, snow fell over much of Maine, with 2 inches at Bangor
during the six hours up to noon, and rain fell over much of the
remainder of New England. Maine state police reported numerous
minor accidents Sunday.
   Rain also was scattered across southwestern Louisiana, from
central Alabama and southeastern Tennessee to central West
Virginia, along the Georgia coast, and across southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 86 at McAllen, Texas.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 7 at Grand Forks, N.D.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 soldiers demonstrated Sunday against the
Soviet army, accusing their officers of torture, sexual abuse and
nepotism.
   The soldiers, many wearing gray wool army coats, gathered in an
icy parking lot in southwest Moscow for the protest organized by
Shield, a group formed last month by troopers accusing the army of
human rights abuses.
   Banners held aloft by the soldiers read: ``No to Violence and
Cruelty in the U.S.S.R. Army!'' and ``Life and Health to the
Soldier!''
   The rally coincided with recent articles in the Soviet news
media that have said the Red Army is falling behind President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   ``The army is still in stagnation with corruption and
nepotism,'' Lt. Vitaly G. Urazhetsev told the crowd. ``The army is
the place today where conservative forces are concentrated.''
   Gorbachev's reforms could be doomed by a military coup
engineered by ``Brezhnev-era generals and marshals,'' he said,
referring to hard-line rule of the late President Leonid I.
Brezhnev from 1964-1982.
   Maria I. Kirbasova, who said she heads a committee of soldiers'
mothers, told the rally that army conscripts are so gripped with
fear they are afraid to speak out when they are beaten or sexually
assaulted. She demanded that mothers be allowed to deliver food to
their sons, who she said are given the equivalent of only $2.60
worth of food daily and receive a monthly salary of $11.34.
   But Vladimir Savostin, an officer at the Lenin
Military-Political Academy, told the crowd the army turns boys into
men, ready to be independent and hard-working after they are
discharged. He said the soldiers have the full rights of every
citizen to seek justice.
   The Soviet media have depicted a different situation. Among the
articles they have carried:
   _ Lt. A. Shustov wrote in the literary journal Znamya that a
soldier in his second year of service takes on the role of a
``teacher.'' ``Often this so-called `teaching' is turned into
torture,'' he wrote. ``A young soldier sometimes ends his suffering
by shooting to death his torturer.''
   _ A quarter of the soldiers drafted this spring had police
records.
   _ Standards of living for junior officers are close to the
poverty level.
   _ privileges for children of VIPs in the army.
   The protests against alleged military abuse has gained so much
momentum that the armed forces' political department and branches
of the Communist Party Central Committee issued statements July 6
denouncing the news reports. They said the reports were
``undermining the authority of the armed forces, the prestige of
military service, and the ties between the army and the people.''
   Articles in the government-controlled press have said lax
discipline has led to a caste system, alcoholism and harassment of
conscripts, including demeaning extra duty and physical abuse.
   One case prominently mentioned was that of a Lithuanian soldier
charged with killing eight comrades in 1987. The soldier said he
attacked the others after they had beat and raped him.
   Virtually all men between the ages of 18 and 25 must serve at
least two years in the armed forces. The Red Army, with about 4
million personnel, is undergoing a reduction of 500,000 soldiers
that Gorbachev ordered last December.

   Amtrak goes to trial on criminal charges
Monday for allegedly dumping raw sewage into Florida waterways in a
case that pits state law against federal law and ecology against
economy.
   Amtrak, which has been dumping along its rights of way under a
federal law dating back more than a century, has come under fire in
several Western states as well as Florida for its sanitary habits.
The case is the first of those disputes to go before a judge on
criminal charges.
   Amtrak is charged with four counts of commercial littering and
one count of creating or allowing a nuisance to health. The
nuisance charge alleges that Amtrak dumped sewage on fishermen in a
boat under a rail trestle on May 18.
   The state charges were filed after Amtrak refused to stop
dumping raw wastes on the tracks and into the St. Johns River and
Rice Creek.
   Although the statute calls for fines and jail times, the state
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped, said Assistant
State Attorney Dennis Bayer, who is prosecuting the case.
   The railroad has threatened to suspend service to Florida, where
it serves about 1 million passengers a year, if the state continues
to press its case.
   It would set a dangerous precedent, Amtrak says, if the railroad
bowed to state law and stopped dumping sewage from its moving
trains. Federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its
right-of-way, and this overrides state and local regulations,
Amtrak contends.
   The railroad went into federal court in Jacksonville to halt
prosecution of the railroad on state charges, but Circuit Judge
Robert Perry refused to delay the trial pending a ruling on the
federal case.
   Amtrak, which operates 12 trains daily in and out of Florida,
may be exempt from regulatory actions but cannot dodge criminal
charges, Bayer said.

<HEAD>Death Sentence for High Priest in Cannibalism Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Some contents may be offensive to some readers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The high priest of a religious cult has
been sentenced to death for murder and leading cannibalism rites
where believers ate one of the sect's followers.
   Mba Ntem, 32, head of the animist sect based in a suburb of the
Gabonese capital, was found guilty and sentenced Saturday after a
two-day trial for murder, cannibalism and mutilation of a corpse.
   The Assises Court found Ntem's assistant, Raymond Mve Owono,
guilty of aiding in the cannibalism ceremonies by serving human
flesh to worshippers. He was sentenced to hard labor for life.
   Four other defendants received lesser penalties in connection
with the clubbing and stabbing death last year of teacher Andre
Ondo Ngong, a member of the cult. Ngong's mutilated body was
discovered in April 1988 in Oyem, a town in northern Gabon.
   After his arrest last year, the official newspaper Union
published a photo of Ntem with a knife in his teeth and a jar
containing pieces of a victim's tongue in his manacled hands.
   The cult was called ``Mvoe Ening,'' which the newspaper
translated as meaning the ``tranquil life.''
   In a ceremony led by Ntem, members of the cult ate Ngong's
stomach, liver, heart, lungs, tongue and genitals in what their
leader called a ``sacred plate,'' according to court testimony.
Some of the worshippers were unaware of the contents, Ntem told the
court.
   The court prohibited other details about the ritual and the cult

central Africa and other parts of the world that a spirit or force
resides in every animate and inanimate object.

<HEAD>Officials Impound Hundreds of Ballots in Suspected Vote Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 ballots suspected to be
fraudulent were impounded in Sunday's state and municipal election
after ballot boxes were found stuffed with votes cast for the
ruling PRI party before the polls opened.
   At Matamoros precinct No. 35A, where only 18 people had signed
in to vote by mid-morning Sunday, election officials counted 562
ballots cast in the race for state representative, and 429 in the
separate box for the mayoral election.
   Almost all of the extra ballots were for candidates of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish
initials as the PRI.
   Mayoral candidate Jorge Cardenas of the opposition Authentic
Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM) accused PRI officials of
orchestrating ``a huge fraud'' throughout the state of Tamaulipas.
   ``The people of Matamoros will not accept this, and neither will
the people of Tamaulipas,'' Cardenas said. Matamoros, a city of
about 180,000 people, lies just across the Texas border from
Brownsville.
   Reymundo Padilla, president of precinct No. 35A, said he did not
know how the ballots ended up in the boxes before polls opened.
   ``Somebody put them in the boxes,'' Padilla said.
   ``Fraude, fraude, fraude (fraud, fraud, fraud),'' chanted a
crowd gathered in a government health clinic while the votes were
being counted. Voting was suspended temporarily.
   PRI mayoral candidate Javier Muzquiz said vote fraud would be
impossible in Matamoros because precinct officials would discover
irregularities.
   ``They (PARM) are inventing stories of fraud when they don't
need to invent stories of fraud,'' Muzquiz said. ``I am not
interested in winning with fraud.''
   PARM officials on Sunday turned over 300 more ballots marked for
the PRI after discovering a man carrying them with him.
   ``They were to be used for tacos,'' said Valentin Jimenez Mora,
a PARM candidate for state representative.
   A ``taco'' in a Mexican election is a ballot with several
additional ballots secretly folded inside, making it possible for
one person to cast more than one vote for a candidate.

<HEAD>Rockets Kill 18 In Kabul, Government Blames Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockets rained down on the Afghan
capital of Kabul Sunday, killing 18 people and wounding many
others, Radio Kabul reported.
   The broadcast monitored in Islamabad said the rockets were made
in the United States and fired by Moslem rebels battling the
Soviet-backed government for more than 10 years.
   ``Pakistan-supported extremists fired a number of U.S.-made
surface-to-surface rockets on Kabul, killing innocent citizens and
causing sorrow to many families,'' Radio Kabul said.
   It reported most of the casualties were inflicted by rockets
that hit a shopping center in downtown Kabul.
   Leaders of the anti-communist insurgents who hold positions in
the hills around Kabul say their rockets are aimed at military
targets and claim government forces fire missiles into the capital
in an effort to discredit the rebels.
   Government reports have said rocket attacks on Kabul since last
June killed 400 people.
   Guerrillas, supported by the United States, control much of the
countryside and rebel leaders have said their strategy is to cut
transportation routes to the major cities held by government forces.
   Rebels have frequently closed the 200-mile Salang highway, the
main route between Kabul and the Soviet Union.
   Western diplomats said last week that heavy fighting along the
highway has forced a delay in the government's planned winter
offensives.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanisan in 1979 to help the
government and had more than 100,000 military personnel in the
country before it began a pullout under a U.N.-brokered accord. It
said all of its combat units had withdrawn from the country by last
February.

<HEAD>Opposition Deputies To Challenge Communist Party Monopoly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of opposition deputies in the Soviet
congress agreed Sunday to challenge the Communist Party's legal
monopoly on power when the legislature reconvenes next month, an
observer said.
   He said the deputies, members of the Inter-Regional Group, also
want the group to be recognized as a formal opposition organization.
   The observer, who spoke with the condition he not be identified
by name, was interviewed after he attended a meeting of the
Inter-Regional Group's Coordination Council at Moscow State
University. The meeting was called to consider the agenda of the
Congress of People's Deputies that opens its winter session Dec. 12.
   Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution decrees the
Communist's Party's ``leading role'' in Soviet politics and society.
   Many reform deputies want that clause revoked and President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party general secretary, has
said he would consider altering or eliminating it.
   Deputy Andrei D. Sakharov, the human rights activist and 1975
Nobel Peace laureate, has said democratization of Soviet society is
impossible unless Article 6 is abolished and other political
organizations are given the same legal and constitutional rights as
the Communist Party.
   The official Tass news agency said the decisions made by the
Coordination Council are tentative and must be considered by a full
meeting of the Inter-Regional Group scheduled for Dec. 9-10.

   Blustery winds in the California
desert Sunday forced NASA to delay space shuttle Discovery's return
to Earth until Monday following a secret mission that put a spy
satellite in orbit.
   Mission Control in Houston informed the five astronauts of the
``wave-off'' about three hours before they were to fire rockets to
drop the craft out of orbit to start an hourlong descent to a
nighttime landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., in the Mojave
Desert.
   ``Discovery has been waved off from its scheduled landing this
evening due to unacceptably strong winds,'' said a statement from
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Mission Control initially rescheduled the landing for 4:32 p.m.
PST, making it a daytime rather than a night landing, as had been
planned for Sunday. Later Sunday evening, Mission Control moved up
the landing to 2:52 p.m. PST.
   Winds gusting to nearly 30 mph sent small duststorms whipping
across the Edwards runways. Mission rules dictate that a shuttle
not land at night if crosswinds are more than 12 mph.
   ``Another problem is that we have no upper level wind data
because the winds keep breaking our weather balloons,'' said NASA
spokeswoman Linda Copley.
   Discovery carries enough fuel and other supplies to remain in
orbit at least through Tuesday. If conditions remained bad at
Edwards, the shuttle could land at either White Sands, N.M., or at
Cape Canaveral.
   Edwards landings are preferred because of the long, wide-open
runways.
   Because the mission is classified, no information is being
reported by NASA. So the reaction of the astronauts to the delay
was not made public.
   The statement did say the crew ``continhued to be in excellent
condition.''
   This was the sixth time is 32 shuttle flights that a landing has
been waved off by bad weather.
   Discovery was slated to be only the third shuttle to land at
night. Its launch Wednesday was the third after dark.
   Most news about the flight was blacked out on Pentagon orders
since Discovery blazed away from Cape Canaveral, Fla. NASA was
allowed to make only periodic statements that the spaceship was
doing fine and to announce the landing time.
   The after-dark liftoff and touchdown were dictated by the need
to put the shuttle's satellite in a specific orbit and by the
military experiments conducted by the astronauts. Some of the
experiments were believed connected with the ``Star Wars'' missile
defense system.
   Sources close to the project said earlier that the astronauts
achieved their main goal Thursday when they released the 2{-ton,
$300 million satellite to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic
communications in the Soviet Union, Europe, Africa and the Middle
East.
   It was believed the astronauts also conducted research into how
people can serve as military observers in space.
   Meanwhile, workers at Cape Canaveral were preparing to move the
shuttle Columbia to the launch pad Tuesday for a Christmas mission.
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off Dec. 18 for a 10-day trip
during which the five-member crew will deploy a Navy communications
satellite and retrieve a scientific payload that has been orbiting
the Earth for nearly six years.

   It had few rules, no queen and a Zsa Zsa
look-alike drill team, but about 50,000 people turned out Sunday
for the ``14th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah Parade,'' a tweak on the
nose to the traditional Rose Parade.
   ``Buy your free programs here,'' yelled vendors as marchers
tried to outdo each other in tackiness and tastelessness. Among the
items of choice used by drill teams were briefcases, lawn furniture
and snow shovels.
   There was no formal judging.
   The parade highlight was the Great Zsa Zsa Drill Team, in which
several women and one burly man, all dressed as Zsa Zsa Gabor,
recreated the actress' infamous policeman-slapping incident with
men dressed as Beverly Hills motorcycle officers.
   Other crowd favorites were The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Drool
Team of the Living Dead Dishonor Guard, featuring marchers who
scared the crowd by toting running gas chain saws (no chains), and
several Exxon Valdez floats, including one operated by roller
skaters who kept falling down and yelling, ``The reef, the reef.''
   The Claude Rains Memorial 20-Man Invisible Marching Drill Team
had a drum major leading a stretch of empty pavement, while the
Barbecue &amp; Hibachi Marching Grill Team members banged on barbecues
with metal tongs.
   Bathroom fixtures were popular among entrants, including a Santa
Claus who drove a bike equipped with an outhouse, whose door would
open to expose a compromised Mrs. Claus. At least two other
entrants sat on toilets, while many band majors carried plungers.
   The Doo Dah parade, devised as an freewheeling alternative to
the stuffier Rose Parade, was first held Jan. 1, 1978, when the
Rose Parade was switched to Jan. 2 to avoid being held on a Sunday.
   Ever since, Doo Dah organizers have made it a point to hold the
parade on a Sunday.

<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
suspended diplomatic and commercial relations with Nicaragua's
Soviet-backed government Sunday to protest the alleged smuggling of
weapons to leftist guerrillas.
   Also Sunday, police arrested an American woman and said they
confiscated some 80,000 rounds of ammunition, explosives,
detonators and grenades stored in her house and several other
locations.
   The move announced by Cristiani in a nationally televised
address occurred one day after military authorities discovered two
light planes delivering weapons to the rebels fighting the
U.S.-backed government.
   One plane crashed in eastern El Salvador and army troops
recovered mostly Soviet weapons, including 25 shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missiles. One of the missiles was U.S.-made. Three
crewmen died, and the fourth committed suicide.
   The other plane apparently was able to unload its cargo after
landing in the southern part of the country, but it was unable to
take off either for lack of fuel or other reasons and was set on
fire by its crew, which then fled.
   Three photographers were detained briefly by the military Sunday
when they went to photograph the plane. The three are Juana
Anderson of The Associated Press, Dayna Smith of The Washington
Post and Daymon Hartley of the Detroit Free Press. They were held
for not having permission to be in the zone of the plane.
   Cristiani told a news conference relations will remain suspended
until Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega ``stops intervening in El
Salvador'' or loses in national elections Feb. 25.
   Missiles and other weapons taken from the wreckage of the plane
that crashed were displayed at the news conference. As Cristiani
spoke, sounds of renewed fighting _ automatic weapons and exploding
rockets _ could be heard after a pause of several days.
   Later, the military explained in a news release that an army
patrol had sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer
on the northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and C-47
warplanes chased them as they fled up the slopes of San Salvador
Volcano.
   The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours.
   In Managua, Ortega said Sunday it gives ``honor and pride'' to
the Nicaraguan people that the government ``of assassins of priests
and religious workers'' in El Salvador broke relations with
Nicaragua. He urged other countries to break ties with San Salvador
until the Cristiani government officials ``have punished the
assassins.''
   He apparently was referring at least in part to the Nov. 16
massacre of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter at a
Roman Catholic university residence. Other Jesuits at the school
say witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before the
killings. The government has denied responsibility.
   In a statement, the Nicaraguan government denied any connection
with the two planes. It quoted Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto as
saying: ``The Salvadoran government should think about the
seriousness of the declarations and actions that the news media are
attributing to them, and about the serious implications in the
regional peace process.''
   Both the United States and a succession of U.S.-supported
governments here have accused Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government of providing secret military assistance to the
guerrillas in their decade-old war for power. The Sandinistas deny
it.
   Saturday's discovery of the arms shipments was the first
concrete evidence to back up the Salvadoran accusations.
   Cristiani called the leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN ``puppets of Communist
aggression.''
   He blasted Ortega and Cuban President Fidel Castro for what he
said was their refusal to join the wave of liberalization sweeeping
much of the Communist world.
   The arrested American was identified as Jennifer Jean Casolo, of
Thomaston, Conn. She is a representative of Christian Educational
Seminar, an ecumenical group based in San Antonio, Texas, and set
up to provide assistance to Americans.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, an armed forces spokesman, told
the news conference that 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made
M-16 rifles, 40,000 rounds of of ammunition for Soviet-designed
AK-47 rifles, 203 blocks of TNT and 403 detonator-caps were found
in the house during a 2 a.m. raid and at other locations.
   Chavez said the arms cache ``proves church involvement'' with
the FMLN. He did not elaborate.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said a consular officer was
with Ms. Casolo throughout the predawn search and accompanied her
to National Police headquarters.
   John Blatz, a spokesman for the Christian Educational Seminar,
called the accusations against Ms. Casolo ``ridiculous'' and ``part
of their (the government's persecution of the churches. That's
clear.''
   In a telephone interview, he said Ms. Casolo has been in El
Salvador since 1985.
   More than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raided
by security forces since the rebels launched an offensive on the
capital Nov. 11.
   Cristiani said he has asked for meetings of the U.N. Security
Council and the Organization of American States. He also said he
will not attend a summit of the five Central American presidents
scheduled for next month in Nicaragua.
   Ortega called the meeting after talks this month in Washington
on demobilizing the Contra rebels broke down.
   Under an agreement signed by Ortega, Cristiani and three other
Central American presidents in Tela, Honduras, the five undertook
to demobilize the Contras by Dec. 5 and pledged the region's
countries would henceforth ban all aid to insurgents.
   In exchange, Ortega agreed to hold national elections Feb. 25
instead of in 1991 and promised the campaigning and voting would be
free and fair.
   Both the Bush administration and Contra leaders have been
insisting that demobilization take place after the elections to
make sure Ortega keeps his word.
   The Tela agreement was part of a peace plan to negotiate an end
to the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan wars and a decades-old leftist
insurrection in Guatemala.
   Two rounds of cease-fire talks between El Salvador's guerrillas
and Cristiani's rightist government earlier this year ended in
deadlock. A third round scheduled Nov. 20-21 was called off after
the guerrillas launched their offensive.

   The Communist premier held
unprecedented talks with opposition leaders Sunday and then joined
bold reformer Alexander Dubcek at a pro-democracy rally before
300,000 elated, flag-waving demonstrators.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee, attempting to regain
control of a growing popular revolt on the eve of a planned general
strike, held a second emergency session in three days and again
reshuffled the party's ruling Politburo, dumping three more
hardliners.
   They were Miroslav Stepan, who resigned as Prague party boss
Saturday, Miroslav Zavadil, who also resigned as trade union boss
Sunday, and Josef Lenart, the longest-serving Politburo member.
   The ouster of Stepan and Zavadil from the Politburo had been
loudly demanded by demonstrators in the past week. Stepan was
blamed for police brutality in Prague Nov. 17 that sparked the
current protests and Zavadil was highly unpopular as head of the
official trade unions.
   Seven new members, including Vasil Mohorita, chief of the
official youth movement, and Miroslav Valek, head of the Writers'
Union were elected to expand the Politburo to its original size of
13 members. The reshuffle on Friday, which dropped seven other
hard-liners including party leader Milos Jakes, had reduced it to
nine members.
   Only three original Politburo members remain, including new
party chief Karel Urbanek.
   Addressing the Central Committee meeting, Urbanek proposed an
extraordinary party congress for Jan. 26 which would have the power
to elect an entirely new Central Committee.
   The second Politburo reshuffle, the talks with reformists and a
Civic Forum meeting with the official Communist youth movement were
part of a frenzied attempt by Communist authorities to avert a
general strike planned Monday.
   Even the armed forces and riot police, who just nine days ago
beat peaceful protesters, indicated backing for the movement during
the rally Sunday. ``We support the democratic changes,'' a riot
policeman told the crowd, which braved freezing weather and snow.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec became the first top official in 20
years to share a platform with Dubcek, the former Communist Party
leader who spent two decades in political exile after Warsaw Pact
tanks crushed his ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in 1968.
   Adamec also held his first talks with leading dissident Vaclav
Havel and independents in an effort to find a way to end the
political crisis and propel Czechoslovakia toward democracy.
   ``Dialogue has begun!'' Havel declared triumphantly at the
rally, which capped a week of pro-democracy demonstrations and
hectic moves by the Communists to regain control.
   Demonstrations were also reported in Bratislava, Brno, Plsen,
Hradec Kralove, Ceske Budejovice, Kosice and other cities.
   ``Civic Forum is ready to create a bridge for a peaceful path
from totalitarianism to civil freedom, which will later be
guaranteed by free elections,'' Havel said, referring to the new
pro-democracy group Civic Forum.
   Adamec told the cheering crowd there was ``no place for rivalry
and interests of prestige.''
   State-run television reported 800,000 people at the rally, but
reporters estimated no more than about 300,000.
   Also Sunday, state television reported that the leaders of the
People's Party, a small party allied with the Communists, submitted
their resignations, apparently because of the anti-government
protest. A meeting was scheduled Monday to choose replacements.
   Dubcek urged the Soviet Union, East Germany and Bulgaria to join
Poland and Hungary in condemning the 1968 invasion that smashed his
attempt to create ``socialism with a human face.''
   Those countries have in various degrees accepted the reforms
introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Hard-line leaders
who rejected change _ Erich Honecker in East Germany, Todor Zhivkov
in Bulgaria, and most recently Czechoslovakia's Jakes _ have been
ousted.
   The Soviet Union signaled support for the developments in
Czechoslovakia Sunday with an article by Gorbachev in the Communist
Party daily Pravda that praised Dubcek's catchphrase ``socialism
with a human face.''
   In other East bloc developments Sunday:
   _Hungarians voted freely for the first time in more than 40
years in a national referendum that will decide when their new
president will be elected and whether politics should be kept out
of the workplace.
   _Reform-minded East German Communists demanded an investigation
into alleged diversion of hard-currency revenues from about 100
party-owned businesses, and a high-ranking Communist said the party
has lost 200,000 members since September;
   _West Germany's Bonn's Die Welt newspaper said Soviet military
leaders told East German troops not to use force against
pro-democracy demonstrators in their country.
   ``Dubcek to the castle!'' the crowd in Prague yelled, referring
to the president's residence.
   At the one-hour talks between Adamec, Havel and several
independents who mediated, the opposition demanded free press,
release of more political prisoners and a parliamentary
investigation into the Nov. 17 incident in which police clubbed
hundreds of demonstrators.
   The sides agreed to meet again Tuesday, government spokesman
Miroslav Pavel said after the talks, which would have been out of
the question a week ago.
   At the start of the talks, Adamec and Havel shook hands across a
table decorated with a small red, white and blue Czechoslovak flag.
   The historic handshake was shown on national television, which
has played a key role in the mushrooming protests, with live
footage of opposition rallies and stormy party meetings as well as
its first interview with Havel.
   The alacrity with which the authorities responded to opposition
demands indicated they feared the strike planned for Monday might
attract workers to the pro-democracy movement. There were mounting
signs of worker support last week in the banners carried at rallies.
   Adamec was booed at the rally for suggesting the strike last two
minutes rather than two hours.
   Pavel quoted Adamec as calling the general strike ``a reality we
can hardly change now,'' but appealing to all sides to avoid
confrontation.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, facing her first
party leadership challenge, would be defeated soundly if a national
election were held now, according to opinion polls published Sunday.
   One poll also indicated two-thirds of voters want Mrs. Thatcher
to resign before the next election, which must be held by mid-1992.
   The polls are among the worst for Mrs. Thatcher since she became
prime minister in 1979, and were published only days after she said
in an interview she's ready to fight two more general elections.
   Sir Anthony Meyer, the rank-and-file legislator challenging Mrs.
Thatcher, warned of ``a painful process of internecine strife'' if
she does not step down.
   The Sunday Times of London poll showed the opposition Labor
Party with 51 percent of voter support, its highest rating in a
decade. The party's 14-point lead over the Conservatives' 37
percent is the biggest lead since 1980.
   A poll in the Observer put Labor at 47 percent and the
Conservatives at 36 percent. Both polls indicated remaining support
was divided among the two centrist parties, the Liberal Democrats
and Social Democratic Party, and other small parties.
   The Sunday Times said its figures would be enough to give Labor
a majority of more than 100 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.
   The Observer poll said of the two-thirds of voters who wanted
Mrs. Thatcher to step down, 44 percent wanted her to go
immediately. Of the one-third of respondents identifying themselves
as Conservatives who think she should resign, 11 percent said it
should happen immediately.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 64, has swept the Conservatives to three
successive election victories and is the longest-serving British
prime minister this century.
   Her Conservative colleagues have routinely endorsed her
leadership since 1975 when she ousted former Prime Minister Edward
Heath. This year, for the first time, she faces a challenger.
   Meyer, a 69-year-old former diplomat, says he'll run against
Mrs. Thatcher for the party leadership unless a more senior Tory
steps forward. Meyer has acknowledged he is a stalking horse.
   Nominations for the party leadership close Thursday, and voting
is scheduled for Dec. 5. Under a complicated voting formula, Mrs.
Thatcher must get 57 percent of the votes to win outright. If she
does not, some more prominent candidate than Meyer would be
expected to enter the race in a second ballot.
   ``It's terrific what she's done during the last 10 years, but
it's so important to conserve those achievements and not put it all
at risk,'' Meyer said Sunday on Sky Television.
   The Sunday Times poll said former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine is the public's favorite to lead the party, with a 30
percent sounding compared with 22 percent for Mrs. Thatcher.
   Among Tories, Mrs. Thatcher came out ahead with 47 percent to
Heseltine's 23 percent. But that was a 10 percent drop for her from
the last sounding in September, and a similar gain from her former
Cabinet minister.
   Both polls were taken last week. The Times poll, conducted by
Market Opinion and Research International (MORI), surveyed 1,068
voters. The Observer poll, conducted by Harris, surveyed 1,037.
Neither gave any margin of error.

<HEAD>Says Vietnam Charging Britain $620 for Each Returning Refugee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will pay Vietnam $620 for each Vietnamese
refugee it forcibly repatriates on the first flight from Hong Kong,
the Financial Times reported Monday.
   The business daily, quoting officials in the Vietnamese capital
of Hanoi, said Britain and Vietnam signed a confidential agreement
about the payments Wednesday.
   ``The sum for further flights would have to be negotiated
separately, officials in Hanoi said,'' the newspaper said.
   There was no immediate from the Foreign Office in London.
   The report said the first repatriations will be by air before
Christmas, probably on a 120-seat Boeing 737 chartered by the Hong
Kong government. The first Vietnamese to be returned probably will
be ``some of the 40,000 held in camps who may well not qualify as
refugees,'' the Financial Times said.
   It said Hong Kong was considering chartering larger aircraft or
even ships to send thousands of Vietnamese boat people home.
   The London newspaper said: ``Vietnamese officials added that
among those people due to be returned were criminals `who would now
be forced to suffer the penalty' and single women with children
whose prospects in Vietnam would be very limited.' They questioned
whether the act of returning such people could be considered
humanitarian.''
   There has been criticism in Britain from lawmakers, civil rights
organizations and the news media of the government's intention to
repatriate thousands of boat people on grounds they are not
political refugees but illegal immigrants to this crowded British
colony.
   The United States also has been denounced for not responding to
British appeals to take some of the refugees while criticizing
Britain for the planned repatriations.
   The exodus of Vietnamese began after the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government was defeated by communist forces from North
Vietnam in 1975, but thousands have continued to flee their
homeland since then.

   The military on Sunday detained
three foreign photographers, including two Americans, who took
pictures of an abandoned airplane that apparently carried supplies
to leftist rebels.
   Juana Anderson of The Associated Press, Dayna Smith of The
Washington Post and Daymon Hartley of the Detroit Free Press were
held for more than six hours for not having permission to be in a
zone where the plane was located.
   Hartley said he and the other two photographers were detained at
a roadblock while leaving the area. He and Smith are American,
while Ms. Anderson is Peruvian.
   ``They checked out press passes, then kept us there about an
hour,'' said Hartley.
   Hartley said the three were led to a nearby town, where they
were told they should have gotten permission to visit the area.
Then they were taken to Treasury Police headquarters in San
Salvador, the capital.
   ``One colonel said, `Welcome to the house where nobody returns,'
when we got to the Treasury Police headquarters,'' Hartley said.
   But shortly afterward, the trio was released when correspondents
from The Associated Press and The Washington Post arrived at
Treasury Police headquarters. Some of the photographs they took
were later published.
   The crew of the plane that was photographed apparently were able
to unload its cargo after landing in the southern part of the
country, but they were unable to take off either for lack of fuel
or other reasons, officials said. The crew set fire to the plane
and fled.
   Hartley said there were trenches dug near the abandoned plane
filled with charred debris.
   The abandoned plane was discovered after another plane crashed
in eastern El Salvador on Saturday. Army troops recovered mostly
Soviet weapons from that plane, including 25 shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missiles.
   The supplies apparently were intended for rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who recently launched a
major offensive against Salvador's rightist government. At least
1,000 people died in that offensive.

   Two Philippine air force planes
collided Monday and crashed into a rice paddy near this southern
city, killing all four crewmen, a military spokesman said.
   The T-28 single-engine planes were approaching the runway here
when they collided at an altitude of about 3,300 feet, said Maj.
Dave Reyes, spokesman for the air force 3rd division.
   He said a third T-28 in the formation landed safely.
   The three planes were flying to Zamboanga from Cotabato City,
150 miles east of Zamboanga, according to Reyes. He said the cause
of the accident has not been determined.

   Opposition parties forged ahead of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party in parliamentary elections
that will determine the fate of the world's only democratically
elected dynasty, results showed Monday.
   ``The Congress Party is no longer going to be the majority in
the next government,'' state television declared.
   Following the bloodiest vote in modern India's 42-year history,
tallies showed the governing Congress Party leading in more races
than any single opposition party but trailing the combined total of
opposition parties. It was falling short of enough seats to form
the next government without enterng a coalition.
   Voting started Wednesday in most of India's 25 states and seven
federally governed territories. By the time polling ended Sunday in
the states of Punjab, Bihar and tiny Sikkim, at least 136 people
had been killed in election-related violence.
   
   PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) _ The Communist premier held
unprecedented talks with opposition leaders Sunday and then joined
bold reformer Alexander Dubcek at a pro-democracy rally before
300,000 elated, flag-waving demonstrators.
   Even the armed forces and riot police, who just nine days ago
beat peaceful protesters, indicated backing for the growing reform
movement. ``We support the democratic changes,'' a riot policeman
told the rally.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec became the first top official in 20
years to share a platform with Dubcek, the former Communist Party
leader who spent two decades in political exile after Warsaw Pact
tanks crushed his ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in 1968.
   Adamec also held his first talks with leading dissident Vaclav
Havel and independents in an effort to find a way to end the
political crisis and propel Czechoslovakia toward democracy.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev displayed solid support
Sunday for reform in Eastern Europe by endorsing socialism with a
``human face'' _ the slogan used by the Czechoslovak progressives
toppled by a Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   In the Czechoslovak capital, Alexander Dubcek, leader of the
ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 21 years ago, read
Gorbachev's remarks at a rally as proof of the Soviet president's
backing for change.
   Two days earlier, the Czechoslovak Communist Party dumped party
chief Milos Jakes and some other leaders associated with hard-line
policies in an attempt to stem the political crisis that has rocked
the country.
   With the East bloc in upheaval, the Soviet Communist Party daily
Pravda published a 2{-page compilation of Gorbachev's thoughts on
the future of socialism and his own program for ``perestroika,'' or
reconstruction of the economy and society.
   
   CHTOURA, Lebanon (AP) _ Newly elected president Elias Hrawi said
Sunday he will replace Christian Gen. Michel Aoun with a new army
commander within 48 hours if Aoun continues to challenge the
fledgling government.
   The warning came after Parliament approved a new Cabinet that
pledged to extend its control over all Lebanon, including the
Christian enclave controlled by Aoun.
   ``If he (Aoun) persists ... I must say with much regret that he
will have to bear the consequences,'' Hrawi told reporters in this
Bekaa Valley town, wehre he has established temporary headquarters
while Aoun refuses to leave the official presidential palace.
   Some parliamentarians speculated Hrawi would resort to military
means if Aoun was not forced out by diplomatic pressure.

   The Airbus consortium plans to build a
new two-engine short- to medium-range aircraft able to carry 186
passengers, Airbus Industrie formally announced Sunday.
   The model A-321 will be an elongated version of the model A-320,
which carries 150 passengers. Ten companies have placed firm orders
for 107 of the planes, with options to buy 14 more, Airbus said.
   The consortium envisions building up to 1,300 of the aircraft,
with the first deliveries to take place in 1994.
   Price figures for the purchases was not immediately disclosed.
   Airbus first signaled its intention to build the A-321 at the
Paris Air Show in June, but postponed an official announcement
until airlines placed a certain number of orders.
   Airbus Industrie is a consortium of the companies Aerospatiale
of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Bloehm GmbH of Germany, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

   OPEC oil ministers Sunday put on hold
tough negotiations for a new production accord to give them more
time to consider ways of halting overproduction while keeping all
the cartel members happy.
   Lack of agreement by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries could send crude prices tumbling to as low as
$15 a barrel in the first quarter of 1990, said one ministerial
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Prices could slump even more in the spring _ to $12 a barrel _
if a deal is not worked out for the second quarter, he said.
   The cartel formally opened its winter strategy session Saturday
to try to come up with an arrangement that would halt production
cheating by some members.
   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, OPEC is producing
more than 23 million barrels a day, according to analysts. Its
output ceiling now is 20.5 million barrels a day.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased their flow _
and violated their output quotas _ to press their demands for
larger shares of OPEC's production pie.
   If the ministers can solve the two countries' demands, they seem
to feel the output ceiling can be bumped up to 22.5 million barrels
a day in the first half of next year without upsetting the market.
   Prices would hold at about their current levels, they believe.
   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. A basket of crudes
monitored by the cartel recently was $17.76 a barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, has been
trading around $20 a barrel. Middle Eastern brands run several
dollars less.
   The ministerial source said two main ideas have been floated for
resolving the problem of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and
neither was acceptable to all.
   One, advanced by Saudi Arabia and Iran, calls for letting
countries with more oil produce more. Under this idea, all but
heavyweights Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq would give up some of
their shares to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the source
said.
   This idea is not palatable to such countries as Algeria,
Indonesia and Nigeria, he said, because such countries have serious
money woes and depend more heavily on their oil revenues than
others. To give up some barrels would be difficult.
   The alternative would be for all members _ including the oil
giants _ to contribute some of their shares to Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates.
   Saudi Arabia's influential minister, Hisham Nazer, has said
repeatedly his country will not reduce its quarter share of total
output.
   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh also has put his foot down, according
to the source.
   Officials are taking a look at various scenarios and juggling
figures to see if these options could resolve their problems.
   If not, the ministers have a ``fallback'' option, said the
source. They could divide any increase in the production ceiling,
say a million barrels a day, proportionately among the 13 countries.
   Such a decision, though, would not satisfy Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates. The two would continue producing more than they are
allotted and keep production high, thus prices could weaken.

   OPEC is at an impasse, and loosely split
into two camps, over how to meet demands fniff fails to pay, GPA, which
is leasing
the five Airbus jets, may sue the carrier in court to take
possession of the jets.
   Since filing for protection from its creditors Sept. 28, Braniff
has stopped flying and laid off most of its workers, who once
totaled more than 4,800. The airline, which now employs about 275
people, is struggling to operate as a charter carrier.
   Airline analysts and experts view Braniff's ability to continue
receiving the 50 Airbus jets as the company's most valuable asset
and best chance for a successful reorganization. American Airlines
has acknowledged that it has discussed with Braniff the possibility
of acquiring those planes.
   Braniff has been stymied, however, in its efforts to sublease
the jets or sell its contracts for them.
   Just hours before the bankrupty filing, GPA canceled its
agreement to lease 26 Airbus jets to the airline. Braniff sued GPA
and several other companies involved in the leases for breach of
contract, violation of U.S. bankruptcy laws and other alleged
business misconduct.
   Because the validity of Braniff's lease and purchase contracts
was disputed, the airline was thwarted in its efforts to reorganize
under Chapter 11, Corcoran ruled.
   Lawyers representing GPA argued that the aviation company could
lose as much as $500 million by March if Braniff cannot meet its
financial obligations for the jets or find a substitute buyer. They
said GPA did not know whether it would appeal Corcoran's decision.

   Newspaper union members voted Sunday to authorize
a strike against The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press on the eve
of the newspapers' scheduled merger of non-editorial operations.
   Teamsters officials said the strike was set for Thursday to give
the employees time to get established under the new operations, set
to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday under a joint operating
agreement first proposed in April 1986. The JOA was upheld earlier
this month by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Talks between the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will run the
papers' combined operations, and Newspaper Unity Coalition,
representing the six largest News and Free Press locals, broke off
at 6 a.m. Sunday.
   The two sides were far apart on union wage demands, both
newspapers reported Sunday.
   ``The members of both papers feel the money package and benefits
were an insult to them,'' said Louis Mleczko, president of Local 22
of the Newspaper Guild. ``The publishers are going to have to share
some of the new riches from the 100-year monopoly they have been
granted from the court.''
   Teamsters Local 372, representing about 1,100 circulation and
warehouse employees, voted 603-76 Sunday night to authorize the
strike beginning 12:01 a.m. Thursday, said Al Derey,
secretary-treasurer-elect of the local.
   ``It seems these corporations that had deep pockets for three
years now suddenly have holes in their pockets,'' Derey said. ``We
asked for Martin Luther King Day as a paid holiday and they turned
us down flat. It's incredible.''
   The Newspaper Guild of editorial workers unanimously approved
strike authorization late Sunday. The guild didn't set a strike
deadline and members planned to be at work Monday, Mleczko said.
About 250 members attended the meeting.
   Larry Harwood, president-elect of Teamsters Local 372, said he
hopes bargaining will resume within a few days.
   Before the strike authorization vote, William Keating, chief
executive of the DNA, said, ``We're optimistic that we'll reach a
settlement and we're going ahead with plans to put out a newspaper
for tomorrow.''
   He was not available late Sunday for further comment.
   Robert J. Hall, publisher and chairman of the Free Press, and
Alan Lenhoff, assistant to the general manager, could not be
reached for comment. Detroit News president and publisher, Robert
H. Giles, was also unavailable for comment.
   Both the News and Free Press reported that the union coalition
was holding to its demand for weekly wage increases of $160 per
worker over three years.
   Management raised its counteroffer from $35.50 to $44 weekly
over 2{ years, sources told the newspapers. The unions also were
offered a contract-signing bonus equal to two weeks' pay if the
partial merger was implemented on schedule.
   Another union, Graphics Communications International Local 13N,
voted Sunday to accept management's money package offer but honor
any other strikes, Mleczko said.
   The three other unions involved, Teamsters Local 2040, Graphics
Communication Local 289 and Communications Workers of America Local
18, were also meeting Sunday night.
   Newsroom employees at both papers said they were working toward
putting together their Monday editions as usual.
   ``We don't know what to expect, but we are working towards
getting an edition together for tomorrow,'' said Renee Murawski, a
Free Press assistant city editor.
   ``You never know what could happen in a situation like this,''
said Bill McMillan, city editor at The News. ``There could be a
last-minute resolution or (contract) extension.''
   Don Kummer, administrative officer for the Newspaper Guild Local
22, said: ``What we're looking at is the company testing the union
to see if they'll strike.''
   Under the joint operating agreement, the newspapers will merge
their non-editorial operations but maintain separate news and
editorial staffs. The Free Press will continue publishing morning
editions Monday through Friday. The News will continue publishing
morning and afternoon editions but will halt home delivery of its
morning edition in metropolitan Detroit.
   The newspapers will publish combined weekend editions.
   The last newspaper strike in Detroit was at the Free Press in
July 1980 when Teamsters struck for 12 days over economic issues.
