   A bookstore chain caught up in the controversy of ``The Satanic
Verses'' went on the offensive Thursday, with writers and
booksellers decrying death threats against its author and Islamic
groups seeking compassion for their faith.
   ``Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism.
Let's vote with our wallets. Buy the book,'' said poet and novelist
Michael Anania at a rally at the Chicago Public Library's Cultural
Center.
   Writers nationwide have rallied in support of Salman Rushdie,
whose novel has enraged Moslems and brought a death sentence from
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and offers of a $5.2 million
bounty.
   Moslem leaders in the United States, while denouncing the death
sentence and threats of violence against bookstores, said the book
was intolerable to followers of Islam and called for withdrawal of
``this slanderous work.''
   ``We simply expect the media to accord Muslims the same rights
that have been generally extended to other religious minorities,''
said Ahmad Zaki Hammad, president of the Islamic Society of North
America in Plainfield, Ind. ``It is regrettable that Viking Penquin
Inc., the (U.S.) publishers, has shown insensitivity to the concerns
of Muslims.''
   Three U.S. bookstore chains had yanked the book off shelves, but
B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores, which are under common
ownership, decided Wednesday to stock the book.
   The third chain, Waldenbooks, the nation's largest with 1,200
stores, placed full-page advertisements in Friday's editions of The
New York Times and eight other newspapers, saying it will continue
to sell the book despite ``many threats of violence.''
   In the text of the ad, Waldenbooks complained that it was
subjected to ``unfair castigation'' for telling its outlets to
remove the book from their shelves for security reasons.
   Waldenbooks noted that it continued to sell the book while not
displaying it until its supply ran out. Also, late last week it gave
store managers permission to display the book at their discretion.
   ``We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock
at the publisher,'' Waldenbooks said. ``We will continue to use
discretion in displaying the book.''
   The chain's president, Harry Hoffman, has said it has received
about 60 bomb threats.
   The Times reported in Friday's editions that demand for ``The
Satanic Verses'' has been strong among independent booksellers, who
report taking orders for nearly 200,000 copies of the book.
   Yet all of the more than 300 independent booksellers surveyed by
the Times said they did not have copies of the book for sale.
   Protests also came from groups in Washington.
   ``The ayatollah hasn't only taken out a contract on Salman
Rushdie: he has taken out a contract on our American freedoms to
read, to write, and to express ourselves as we choose,'' said Arthur
J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way. The
275,000-member organization has opposed efforts by American
fundamentalists to censor textbook and school reading lists.
   An ad hoc group calling itself the International Committee for
Free Expression also issued a statement in Washington decrying
Iran's threats against the British author.
   ``We can not and will not tolerate a threat to assassinate a
writer for his ideas or others for disseminating those ideas,''
declared the committee, which includes the American Library
Association and American Booksellers Association.
   At the Chicago rally, 300 writers and supporters heard Pulitzer
Prize-winning author Studs Terkel compare Rushdie to John Scopes,
who was tried for teaching Darwinism, and author John Steinbeck,
criticized for his ``Grapes of Wrath.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen born in India into a Moslem family,
went into hiding in England because of the death threats.
   The president of Chicago's Muslim Community Center, Mohammed
Kaiseruddin, said after the writers' speeches that he objects to the
death sentence, but doesn't believe such ``very strong, profane
passages about people Moslems respect the most'' should be tolerated
by society.
   A writer in Seattle was organizing a public reading of Rushdie's
work for March 9, the day he was supposed to give a reading during a
U.S. promotional tour that was canceled.
   At a public reading Wednesday night at Ohio University in Athens,
those who read the passages said their intent was not to offend
Islam but to protest censorship.
   ``We are here to confirm our right as Americans to read whatever
we want,'' said graduate student Ed Allen.

<TEXT>
   To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor
Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used. In Japanese
he was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.
   The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese, who
found it impolite, and unnecessary since to them there is only one
emperor. Some Japanese complained that after his death it even
became inaccurate to call him Hirohito because he has been given the
posthumous name Showa.
   In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the
name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926. It
means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, or
Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of
Hirohito's son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.
   But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so
able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even
official agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-language
publications.
   The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, which
is supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed ``His late Majesty
The Emperor Hirohito.''
   English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began
using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not
become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted
a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperor's posthumous name.
   A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the
posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial.
   The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their
reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito's
grandfather.
   In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on
the throne. Thus 1926 became Showa 1 as Crown Prince Hirohito
ascended to the throne on Dec. 25 when his father, Emperor Taisho,
died. The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was Showa 64 until
Hirohito's death on Jan. 7. Now this year is Heisei 1.
   The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique
among world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of names
and titles in a royal career. In Britain, Prince Andrew became the
Duke of York upon his marriage in 1986.

   An Idaho businessman who lost $125,000 in uncut
diamonds during his return from Europe got them back from a good
Samaritan who found them on an airport sidewalk.
   Chris Cacioppo, a 53-year-old office worker, received a $7,500
reward from Roland Von Walker of Rigby, Idaho, for his good deed.
   Cacioppo returned the diamonds Thursday to a Walker business
associate, George St. Laurent, during a meeting at the office of
Cacioppo's lawyer.
   ``Mr. Walker was certainly pleased,'' St. Laurent said. ``We were
a little surprised that they hadn't been turned in earlier.'' He
said they were virtually worthless uncut.
   Walker, 62, lost the diamonds at O'Hare International Airport on
Friday, when he flew in from Amsterdam.
   He had returned from his travels with 76 uncut stones, worth
about $220,000, which he had mined and purchased in Liberia. He
carried them in two envelopes pinned inside his pants pockets.
   But when Walker reached the U.S. Customs Service desk at O'Hare,
one envelope was missing. He reported the loss Saturday.
   Cacioppo, of suburban Mount Prospect, was on the same KLM
Airlines flight and said he found the envelope of diamonds on the
sidewalk outside a terminal.
   ``I picked it up and put it in a pocket without looking in it
because I wasn't feeling too swift,'' he said.
   Because of his illness, Cacioppo said he stayed in bed Saturday
and finally got up on Sunday to eat something. Then his wife asked
about the package.
   ``I opened it and wasn't sure what they were,'' he said. ``I took
them to a friend, who told me he thought they were real diamonds.''
   Cacioppo said he was excited and pretty nervous about the
discovery, and at the insistence of a friend, contacted attorney
Robert Clifford for advice. Clifford phoned Chicago police, who
provided Walker's telephone number.
   Cacioppo, who plans to use the money to finance his son's college
education, said he did not regret giving up the diamonds. ``It was
the right thing to do.''

<HEAD>Amherst College, UMass Leaders Condemn Annual Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heads of Amherst College and the
University of Massachusetts have joined forces to condemn an annual
snowball fight that nearly blinded a student in one eye this winter.
   The two school leaders released a statement Thursday blasting the
Dec. 14 fight as Amherst College prepared a lawsuit against its
neighbor, UMass, for building damages and medical costs incurred by
the injured student, Gary E. Gonya, 19, of Toledo, Ohio.
   ``The freshman student had to undergo emergency surgery to save
an eye. In light of this incident it has become clear to us that we
can no longer tolerate the continuation of this `tradition,'''
Amherst President Peter R. Pouncey and UMass Chancellor Joseph D.
Duffey said in the statement.
   Pouncey estimated damage to the school at more than $10,000 in
the last several years. The two school leaders promised ``to educate
our students about the dangers of this event and ... plan other
measures to deter students from participating.''
   Amherst spokeswoman Terry Allen said it was unclear what further
measures the schools will take. She said police have been unable to
identify Gonya's assailants from videotapes of the snowball fight.
   The fights usually take place on the first significant snowfall
of the year. University students march to the Amherst campus a mile
away and engage in battle.
   Amherst College will seek a preliminary injunction to allow
campus and town police to arrest anyone found instigating a snowball
fight at the school, said school spokesman Douglas Wilson.
   The complaint against UMass is expected to be filed with
Hampshire Superior Court in the next few days, according to Wilson.
   Duffey and Pouncey contended that the violence has escalated as
students have begun packing snowballs with rocks that have broken
several dormitory windows. Gonya, who may have been hit with a
snow-covered rock, spent five days in hospitals in Northampton and
Boston. Doctors say his vision is blurry, but he will regain sight
in a few months.
   In 1987, UMass paid more than $3,000 to Amherst College for
damages from that year's snowball fight. The college claims UMass
still owes $1,788 from last year's bombardment.
   ``I don't think this university as an institution is liable for
the behavior of its students once they leave the campus,'' Duffey
has said.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper headlines show a vastly different Japan
from the nation that George Bush fought five decades ago in World
War II.
   _ ``Japan Launches Scientific Satellite.'' A routine matter;
EXOS-D is Japan's 12th spacecraft to go into orbit to study the
Earth.
   _ ``Japanese Airline Announces Multibillion-Dollar Airliner
Purchase.'' Also routine; Boeing's biggest customer is Japan Air
Lines, and Wednesday's order by its competitor, All Nippon Airways,
could make ANA the biggest buyer of Boeing's new 747-400s and hack
$7 billion off the U.S. trade deficit.
   _ ``Funeral Diplomacy in Full Swing as World Leaders Arrive.''
Not routine; Japan buries Emperor Hirohito on Friday, the first
imperial funeral in 62 years. Despite memories of aggression
committed in Hirohito's name in World War II, his funeral has
brought dignitaries from more than 160 countries to Tokyo.
   University of Tokyo political science professor Seizaburo Sato
said there were two reasons for so many countries to come: ``One is
the increasing interdependence of the countries throughout the
world. And the second is the increasing importance of Japan in the
world community.''
   Japan is rich. It is exerting international influence through
financial power while its military strength is held in check by a
postwar constitution that rejects force as a way of dealing with
international disputes.
   In many ways, Japan is about as up to date as you can get. Its
industrial prowess has made its automakers into global operators who
produce more motor vehicles than U.S. competitors. In high
technology, the Japanese are at the forefront of superconductivity
research and computer developments.
   The robust economy is propelled by the renowned diligence and
managerial skill of the Japanese. At the government's urging, the
economy is being restructured to depend more on domestic consumption
than on the export drives that led to trade imbalances and friction
with other countries.
   One problem is politics, which is widely held to have been
corrupted by the tide of cash that has accompanied Japan's rise to
economic superpower.
   A headline in Thursday's Mainichi Shimbun: ``Questioning of
Political Figures Looms.'' The story said that prosecutors
investigating suspected bribery are on the verge of deciding whether
to question 17 politicians about ethically dubious share
transactions that benefitted them or their aides.
   Among those politicians is Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, the
chairman of the committee organizing Hirohito's funeral and playing
host to the presidents, kings, prime ministers and other foreign
officials now in Tokyo. Also on the list are Takeshita's
predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, and other leaders of the Liberal
Democratic Party.
   All have denied any wrongdoing. But some Japanese media are
speculating that Takeshita will not last long, despite his announced
intention to clean up political ethics starting right away.
   Still looming are those prosecutors, who arrested eight
businessmen and bureaucrats in the last two weeks for questioning on
suspicion of bribery or securities law violations but haven't
touched the politicians yet.
   The conservative party has governed since World War II with the
exception of 10 months of socialist Cabinets in 1947-48. It holds
fat majorities in both houses of the Diet, or Parliament _ 297 of
512 seats in the House of Representatives and 143 of 252 in the
upper House of Councillors.
   In July, however, elections will be held for half the upper-house
seats, and the ruling party is worried. A setback would probably
send Takeshita to the back benches of the Diet, and the Recruit
scandal has tainted so many leaders of his party that it's hard to
guess who would succeed him.
   Another of Thursday's headlines: ``LDP's Man Quits Race for
Governor Over Recruit Funds.'' Recruit Co. is the conglomerate at
the center of the stock-trading scandal threatening the ruling
party, and it has become anathema to have received its donations.
The news story says that Takeshita persuaded his candidate, Kazuo
Aichi, to withdraw from the Miyagi prefecture gubernatorial race
because Aichi had received $60,000 in donations from Recruit since
1975.
   The conservatives' long grasp on power has both stultified
politics and encouraged corruption, analysts say. It's also widely
held that the conservatives' pro-business policies helped make Japan
the peaceful economic giant it has become after being laid waste in
the war.
   This conundrum of money politics linked with economic strength is
making the Japanese especially thoughtful as they close a long
chapter of history in burying their emperor of 62 years.
   A headline from Thursday evening's television news: ``Prosecutors
Question Former NTT Head.'' NTT, or Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Co., is the most valuable company in the world in terms of stock
market capitalization. Its former chairman, Hisashi Shinto, had a
reputation as an exponent of clean business and politics until he
resigned last year in disgrace after it was shown he had profited in
the Recruit scandal's shady stock transactions.

<TEXT>
   An Indiana House committee has approved a
bill that would permit a jail sentence to be suspended for a
convicted rapist, criminal deviate or child molester who undergoes
surgical castration.
   Rep. Richard L. Worden, an investigator for the public defender
in Allen County and a former constable, said he introduced the bill
out of frustration that current criminal sanctions against rapists
and child molesters don't deter criminals from committing those acts
again.
   ``You take the part away from the man that starts the process in
the first place,'' said Worden, a Republican.
   The crimes now carry prison sentences of six to 50 years,
depending on the circumstances.
   The bill, which the House County and Township Committee approved
by a 5-3 vote on Thursday, calls for a convicted rapist, child
molester or criminal deviate to be set free if after sentencing the
person volunteers for surgical castration. The measure now goes to
the full House.
   An opponent of the bill, Democratic Rep. John Gregg, pointed out
that many child molestation cases don't involve intercourse.
Offenders castrated after those crimes might still commit child
molestation again, he said.
   ``I don't think we ought to be setting our policy in Indiana to
follow Islamic countries,'' said Gregg.
   Another opponent, Ruth Peters of the Indiana Civil Liberties
Union, argued that rape often is a crime of violence, not one
motivated by sexual drives. Under Worden's proposal, she said, a
convicted rapist who had been castrated could go free to commit
other violent acts.

<HEAD>Government Report Cites `Elevated Risk' Of Cancer In Tannery Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials have reported for the
first time that some leather tannery workers exposed on the job to a
controversial solvent are at increased risk for testicular cancer.
   An estimated 90,000 or more U.S. workers are exposed to the
chemical solvent dimethlyformamide, or DMF. The national Centers for
Disease Control said Thursday that while tannery workers exposed to
the solvent are at ``elevated risk,'' DMF cannot currently be shown
as a ``definitive'' cause, and the exact risks require further
evaluation.
   DMF is also used in the aircraft industry. The National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health believes that about 94,000 U.S.
workers are potentially exposed to the solvent.
   Three cases of testicular cancer were diagnosed in workers at a
leather tannery in upstate New York's Fulton County between 1982 and
1984, triggering a state and federal investigation. The tannery had
used DMF to help dyes seep into the leather being processed there.
   Three such cases among 80 workers on the plant's finishing line
between 1975-87 is 41 times greater than would be expected
statistically, which ``indicates an elevated risk for testicular
cancer among finishing line workers,'' the CDC said.
   Further, a survey of medical records found seven additional cases
of testicular cancer in Fulton County males aged 20-54 between 1974
and 1987. ``Five of the 10 case-patients ... had been employed in
leather-related occupations,'' the CDC said in its report Thursday,
prepared with NIOSH.
   Two of those five patients were from tanneries other than the
original investigation site, Calvert said.
   The CDC report noted that the tannery, identified in news reports
as the Pan American tannery of Gloversville, had withdrawn its DMF
dyes and replaced them with other materials, and other nearby
facilities have done the same or are considering it.

   Democrats and Republicans alike say they are
concerned that the White House forced Health and Human Services
Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan to forgo nearly $300,000 he was
entitled to from his medical school job.
   ``I feel what is being asked of you has not been asked of others
in the past,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, which endorsed Sullivan on a 19-0 vote
Thursday.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., agreed, saying, ``It is grossly unfair
to him. ... My hope is we can reopen this issue with the White
House.''
   The issue of Sullivan's severance pay from the Morehouse School
of Medicine in Atlanta came to light earlier this month when
President Bush was trying to fend off ethical questions about
several of his other top appointees.
   Committee members said they think the White House overreacted and
forced Sullivan to give up the severance pay even though he was
entitled to the money and accepting it would not have violated any
ethical rules.
   At the time, Bush was on the defensive on ethics issues, with
questions being raised about Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower's relationships with defense contractors, White House ethics
chief C. Boyden Gray's links to a communications corporation,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp's acceptance of
speaking fees exceeding House limits, and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter's acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco
company.
   Sullivan said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that he
decided to forgo the severance pay because conflict-of-interest
questions were raised in news reports about the arrangement. He said
such questions could hamper his effectiveness and damage the image
of Morehouse.
   ``I felt it was more important to clear up those questions by the
action I took,'' he said.
   Donald Campbell, deputy director of the Office of Government
Ethics, has said the office concluded that Sullivan was entitled to
take the severance pay, but that he surrendered it before the
opinion could be written.
   The White House did not return calls for comment on the Senate's
concerns Thursday.
   Bentsen said after the hearing that it appeared the nominee's
decision to forfeit the money ``has been pressed on him,'' adding
that Sullivan ``is not in any kind of position to make that kind of
sacrifice.''
   Bentsen suggested that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
might look into the matter and, if appropriate, clarify that ethics
rules were not intended to apply to the kind of contractual
arrangement Sullivan had with Morehouse.
   The severance pay generated more interest among committee members
than Sullivan's position on abortion, which had produced the most
public controversy over Bush's only black Cabinet nominee.
   In his opening statement to the committee, Sullivan said he holds
the same views on the issue as Bush: ``I am opposed to abortion,
except when the life of the mother is threatened, or cases of rape
or incest.''
   He also said he supports an anti-abortion amendment to the
Constitution with the same exceptions and would like to see the
Supreme Court overturn its 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
abortion.
   Sullivan apologized to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., for having
``misspoken'' his position on abortion in a private meeting with the
senator when he reportedly said he favored retaining Roe vs. Wade.
He did not address remarks he made in an Atlanta newspaper that he
supported abortion rights.
   David J. Andrews, acting president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said following the committee vote that he was
``deeply troubled'' by Sullivan's testimony. ``It is obvious that
much political maneuvering has gone on in the weeks since Dr.
Sullivan's appointment was first announced,'' Andrews said.
   The National Right to Life Committee, which was riled by
Sullivan's earlier remarks, welcomed the secretary-designate's
statements opposing abortion.
   However, Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the
anti-abortion group, said he was disappointed that Sullivan refused
to say whether he would extend a moratorium barring federal funding
of medical research involving the transplant of fetal tissue.
   Questioned by Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., Sullivan said: ``I
certainly would not want to do anything that would encourage
abortion to be done in order to get fetal tissue.''
   However, Sullivan said he would not venture further on the issue
until he reviews the recommendations of an advisory committee and
consults with others about when, if ever, it might be appropriate to
use fetal tissue for medical research.
   Armstrong said he was disappointed in Sullivan's reply and, when
the time came to vote on Sullivan's confirmation, the senator simply
voted ``present.''

<HEAD>Democrats Outspend GOP for Congress</HEAD>

   Democrats who control Congress now dominate the
means of getting there, having spent more money, raised more and
received more from special interests than the Republicans.
   The Federal Election Commission put the price tag for electing
the 101st Congress last year at $458 million, not appreciably higher
than it was to finance the campaigns of the 100th Congress two years
earlier.
   However, the commission, in a report issued Thursday, found that
the Democrats now have surpassed the Republicans in raising money
for Senate campaigns from political action committees. In the House,
the Democrats have widened the lead they held previously.
   One result is that Republicans suddenly are sounding like
threadbare populists, while Democrats say they have made peace with
the captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion.
   ``All of the Democrats' expressions of concerns about the
Republicans being the party of moneyed interests are shown up by
these figures to be absolutely false,'' said John Buckley, a
spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which
provides money and other help for GOP House candidates.
   However, Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said her party was able to recruit stronger
candidates and they, in turn, were able to attract greater
contributions.
   In the Senate, Democratic candidates got almost $24.9 million
from political action committees, or PACs, while Republicans
received $21.5 million, according to the FEC report.
   Until last year, the Senate Republicans had raised more money
from PACs than did Democrats. In 1986 the GOP raised $4.9 million
more than Democrats from PACs, and in 1984 the margin was $1.6
million.
   The differences were far more pronounced in the House, where the
Democrats' control is more lopsided. House Democratic candidates
received more than $66.9 million from PACs while Republicans got
barely half that amount, $34.9 million. The gap between Democrats
and Republicans in 1986 was $22 million and in 1984 it was $17
million.
   ``I think that PACs take a look at races and they take a look at
candidates and I think, frankly, we just had better candidates,''
Ms. Dunn said. ``They are not perceived as hostile to the business
community, as they aren't.
   ``I think this is a party that realizes that certainly business
is important to this country.''
   Overall, the Democrats raised $107.4 million for Senate campaigns
and spent almost $107.5 million in 1987 and 1988, the two-year
period the election commission uses for compiling figures on the
most recent election. The Republicans raised $91.3 million and spent
$93.2 million.
   In the House, Democrats raised $159.8 million and spent $145.1
million while the GOP received $116.6 million and spent $110.5
million.
   Another $1.3 million was spent by the 264 candidates who ran for
Congress as independents or on minor-party tickets.
   Republicans in Congress have called for reform of the campaign
finance system, saying it gives an unfair advantage to incumbents _
most of whom are Democrats. But while backing some means of limiting
spending, the Republicans are against any reform that would involve
public financing of congressional campaigns, as is now the case with
presidential candidates.
   Ms. Dunn said Republicans have become recent converts to the idea
of finance reform.
   ``The Republicans didn't complain about the PAC system in 1986,
when they controlled the Senate and their incumbents outspent our
challengers 2-1 or 2{-1,'' Ms. Dunn said.
   Among Senate candidates, Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spent far
more than anyone else to keep his job _ nearly $13 million. Wilson's
Democratic opponent, Leo McCarthy, spent almost $7 million.
   That was considerably less than in the 1986 campaign, when
Wilson's colleague from California, Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston,
spent nearly $10.8 million to fend off Republican Ed Zschau, who
spent some $11.3 million.
   ``It's just because it's so damned expensive to run in
California,'' said Linda Royster, a spokeswoman for Wilson. ``The
media market in California is so massive and so expensive it
virtually compels a candidate for statewide office there to raise
more money than some would think is humanly possible.''
   Ms. Royster said Wilson accepts fund-raising as something he has
to do to be in politics, but it ``drives him crazy.''
   Wilson raised $1.8 million from PACs, second only to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, who raised more than $2.3 million.
   ``He says while he does not believe there is a conflict of
interest involved in accepting PAC contributions, as long as there
is a public perception that it is creating a conflict of interest,
the Congress has a responsibility to do something about reform,''
Ms. Royster said.
   In the House, two Democrats who unsuccessfully sought an open
seat in a Tennessee special election topped the spending list. Jane
Eskind spent nearly $2.6 million while Philip Bredesen spent almost
$1.9 million. Bob Clement, who beat them, spent just $938,492, but
that brings the total spent on that one seat in Congress to nearly
$5.4 million.
   Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl won a seat in the Senate and a
distinction in the 1988 campaign. He spent nearly $7.4 million on
his campaign and some $6.1 million of that was his own money, a
record for the year. Much of the remainder was borrowed.

   More than a month after taking office, the Bush
administration is still marking time on major foreign policy issues
while the Soviet Union takes the initiative in the Middle East and
nuclear weapons reduction talks remain on hold.
   The funeral diplomacy President Bush is conducting in Tokyo _
20-minute meetings with world leaders assembled for Emperor
Hirohito's rites _ is being described in some press accounts as
``mini-summitry,'' but the sessions are so brief they can only
scratch the surface of difficult problems.
   In the meantime, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
is winding up a whirlwind swing through the Middle East in which he
offered Israel a resumption of diplomatic ties in exchange for
attending a peace conference with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Apart from that proposal, the Shevardnadze trip is important
because it marks a new initiative by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to work with Arab moderates instead of the radical forces that are
only on the periphery of events.
   That could make the Soviets an important player _ especially if
Moscow restores ties with Israel after a lapse of more than 21 years.
   Bush's remark this week before his departure for Tokyo that the
Soviets would _ and should _ play only a limited role in Middle East
diplomacy drew a light-hearted rebuke Thursday in Cairo from
Shevardnadze.
   ``That is sad,'' the foreign minister said. ``It injects a
meaning of rivalry. If the United States can single-handedly resolve
all the issues in the Middle East we would welcome that. But they
can't. There must be a collective effort to defuse the Middle East
crisis.''
   Bush said he would not be rushed or stampeded by Soviet moves,
but the pressure for a U.S. initiative is coming not only from
Moscow. Touring NATO capitals last week, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was urged by the British, Spanish, Dutch, Greek and French
to seize on what they contend is growing Palestinian moderation and
to get involved in peace-making.
   But Baker told them it would be a mistake to move too quickly or
to aim too high if the situation did not call for it. And he was
still cautious after Bush met in Tokyo with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, King Hussein of Jordan and President Chaim Herzog of Israel.
   Baker said there were ``perhaps some opportunities out there with
respect to the Middle East peace process that haven't existed
before.''
   At the State Department, meanwhile, there was no word on when the
policy review would be completed.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman said ``policies are being looked at
in a broad sense.'' He said experts were examining the issues and
that policy-makers would get involved ``at the appropriate time.''
   The review of U.S. arms control policy also is in low gear.
   Negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range nuclear
weapons were to resume last week. The talks have been postponed
indefinitely, although NATO and the Warsaw Pact will open separate
negotiations on non-nuclear forces in Vienna on March 7.
   The Reagan administration was aiming at a 50 percent reduction in
strategic nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines. The two main
obstacles to completing a treaty were the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative and finding ways to verify compliance with the accord.
   Policy-makers in the Bush administration may be less committed to
the search for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles.
That could point to a compromise with the Soviets, who are
determined to slow down the ``Star Wars'' program.
   On the other hand, Brent Scowcroft, the assistant to the
President for national security affairs, might push for development
of a new mobile missile. That could complicate the verification
problem, as well as require a re-calculation of some tentative
weapons ceilings set during the Reagan administration.
   And completing the START treaty could be delayed even further.

   A long-predicted downturn in military
recruiting has begun, with Army recruiters missing their quotas for
the first time this decade, the Pentagon says.
   The other three military services managed to hit their enlistment
quotas for the first quarter of fiscal 1989, but also are showing
signs of distress, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The downturn has been predicted for more than a year, primarily
because of the strong economy and a dwindling pool of 18-year-olds.
   ``But we need to act now to head off future recruiting
problems,'' said Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant defense secretary
for force management and personnel.
   ``The first step is to work with Congress on military pay and to
restore the value of recruiting incentives, advertising resources
and education benefits,'' he said. ``Otherwise, we could begin the
chain of events that led to the serious military manpower problems
of the last decade.''
   The latest manpower report covers the period from last Oct. 1 to
Dec. 31. During those three months, the four services had a combined
quota of 61,900 people.
   The services signed up 61,700 _ or just 200 shy of their goal.
But breaking the statistics down by individual service, the Army
fell short of its goal of 24,143 by 475 men and women _ the first
such decline since 1980.
   The Navy managed to exceed its quarterly goal of 18,900 by
signing up 19,200 men and women. But it did so by calling up,
earlier than expected, volunteers who had joined the Delayed Entry
Program to put off their military service by a few months.
   The Army and Navy also had to increase the percentage of
``Category 4'' volunteers _ or low scorers on the military entrance
test _ that they accepted, the report shows. The Army had to accept
almost 11 percent of its recruits from Category 4, more than double
the 4 percent level maintained for the past three years.
   The Marine Corps matched its recruiting goal during the quarter
by bringing in 7,100 men and women, and the Air Force also matched
its objective of 11,800.
   ``But the Marine Corps and Air Force have reported they are
working harder to meet their recruiting objectives,'' Green said.
   ``While the department still considers this recruiting
performance to be good, environmental factors cannot be ignored,''
Green said Thursday.
   ``Unemployment is at a 14-year low; the youth population will
continue to decline through fiscal 1996, and budgetary pressures
remain a concern.''
   According to Census Bureau projections, the pool of 18-year-olds
in the United States has been declining for some years and won't
begin increasing again until at least 1996.

   While President Bush is half a world away, his
supporters are trying to convince skeptical conservatives he is a
worthy successor to their longtime hero Ronald Reagan.
   ``Ronald Reagan started the revolution,'' former Rep. Jack Kemp
told Thursday's opening session of the Conservative Political Action
Conference. ``I'll bet you right here and now today that George
Bush, President Bush, will consolidate it, strengthen it, broaden
it, broaden its appeal.''
   Long a conservative favorite, Kemp now is housing secretary in
the Bush Cabinet.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's hand-picked chairman of the Republican Party,
cited his involvement in three Reagan presidential campaigns and
then said, ``Another hero of mine is George Bush.''
   Confronted by an openly critical delegate from Young Americans
for Freedom, Atwater said that ``there is something to criticize
about any president'' but conservatives were ``not going to get a
better conservative elected the rest of this century than George
Bush.''
   YAF delegates from California issued a ``report card'' on the
Bush presidency and said he ``has walked away from his conservative
campaign promises that won him the election.''
   The group gave Bush an ``F'' on aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels. ``It is well known that the Bush administration will refuse
to seek military aid to the freedom fighters,'' they said.
   When Jeffrey E. Wright, the chairman of the California YAF
chapter, confronted the party chairman after the speech, Atwater
said, ``There's nobody who feels stronger about freedom fighters
across this globe than George Bush.''
   ``I would not judge things quite this early if I were you and I
wouldn't be too harsh on him until you see what happens,'' said
Atwater.
   ``I have to judge him, sorry,'' said Wright.
   ``I'm sorry, too,'' said Atwater.
   Bush is used to criticism from delegates to this annual meeting.
   Two years ago, as the fight for the 1988 Republican presidential
nomination was heating up, Bush outraged many conservatives by
declining an invitation to address C-PAC.
   His six rivals appeared at the conference.
   Despite opposition from many conservative activists, Bush easily
won the GOP nomination and a little more than a month ago succeeded
Reagan in the White House.
   Reagan was a regular participant at C-PAC meetings, and his
retirement cast a long shadow on the current one.
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, one of
the principal sponsors of the conference, noted that Reagan had
participated in 13 of the 16 C-PAC meetings, including all those
held while he was president.
   ``His absence this year really is symbolic of another change
within the movement, the Reagan era, for all of its importance ...
has ended,'' said Keene.
   Sergio Picchio, national chairman of Young Americans for Freedom,
said the retirement of Reagan meant ``we don't really have a leader
that unifies the whole movement.''
   When he and Keene were asked to identify likely successors to
Reagan as the leader of the conservative movement, the names they
cited included Kemp, Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas and Trent Lott of
Mississippi, and columnist and former White House aide Pat Buchanan.
   No one suggested Bush might succeed Reagan as the conservative
hero.

   President Bush should begin correcting ``the
deplorable conditions on most Indian reservations'' by putting a
someone in the White House in charge of issues affecting native
Americans, say three senators who have been investigating those
conditions.
   ``We urge you to consider our call for active and coordinated
policy-making at all levels of the government, most notably at the
White House, the Office of Management and Budget, and the
departments of Interior and Justice,'' said Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., in a
letter Thursday to Bush.
   By putting someone at the White House in charge of Indian issues,
Bush would ``send a signal throughout the Indian communities of your
dedication to America's first inhabitants,'' they said.
   The senators are members of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs and have been conducting special investigative hearings on a
wide range of problems on reservations and within government
agencies doing business with them.
   They said they wanted to meet as soon as possible with whomever
Bush designates.
   The senators said their hearings will likely produce legislative
proposals for correcting longtime deficiencies in government
policies toward Indians.
   The White House could, in the meantime, get reform started, they
said.
   In their letter, the senators said testimony before their
committee casts doubt on whether the federal government is meeting
its responsibility to protecting the rights of American Indians to
their land, water, forest, hunting, fishing and mineral resources.
   ``As we are sure you will agree, legal representation is at the
very core of the federal government's trust responsibility to
American Indians,'' they said. ``The inherent conflicts facing the
federal trustee arise not only in legal matters, but also in policy
decisions.''
   The president was in Japan Thursday for the funeral of the late
Emperor Hirohito. There was no immediate response to the senators'
letter from the White House.

   High school principals enjoyed a 4.9 percent
salary boost to an average of $52,987 this school year, reflecting
what one official called a recognition that they are ``key players''
in the drive for better education.
   The lowest salary scale among senior high principals nationwide
was $30,497, paid in one of the largest districts surveyed with at
least 25,000 students, according to the survey by the National
Association of Secondary School Principals.
   The report was released Thursday at the principal group's annual
meeting being held this week in New Orleans. Data on more than 1,000
school districts around the country was collected by the Educational
Research Service, a private, nonprofit research arm created in 1973
by the principals' association and several other education groups.
   Pay increases exceeded the 4.1 percent overall inflation rate for
1988, but were not as steep as the 6-7 percent salary increases of
the preceeding four years.
   ``I think it represents the fact that principals are being
recognized as key players in the drive for better schools,'' said
Paul W. Hersey, the association's director of professional
assistance.
   Hersey pointed out that more school districts are trying ``school
based management,'' where individual schools are freed to try
different strategies with less outside interference.
   That kind of reform ``requires highly skilled leaders who are
paid well,'' Hersey said.
   The survey calculated average salaries by school district size,
but did not identify individual school districts, nor did it give
state-by-state averages.
   Average pay for high school principals was $52,987, up from
$50,512 a year ago. But the averages ranged from $55,991 in
districts of 25,000 students or more to $47,612 in districts with
enrollments of 300 to 2,499.
   Hersey said in an interview that the highest salary found in the
survey was $86,500 for a senior high school principal in a district
in the Northeast with enrollment between 2,500 and 9,999 pupils.
   The survey also found that junior high and middle school
principals averaged $49,427, up 5 percent from last year's $47,078.
Elementary school principals' average pay rose 5.1 percent to
$45,909 compared with $43,664 in 1987.

<HEAD>FSX Deal Prompts Call for Putting Commerce Secretary in NSC</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The handling of a controversial aircraft
technology deal with Japan has prompted a California congressman to
call for making the secretary of commerce a statutory member of the
National Security Council.
   ``I strongly feel the United States must give more weight to
long-term commercial interests in its national security
decision-making,'' Democrat Mel Levine told a House panel Thursday,
explaining why he plans to introduce legislation next week.
   Critics of the deal involving Japan's proposed FSX warplane _ to
be built using technology developed for the U.S. F-16 fighter _
contend it was negotiated by State and Defense department officials
without participation by the Commerce Department, U.S. Trade
Representative and other agencies.
   The Bush administration, faced with mounting concern on Capitol
Hill, has asked the Defense Department and Commerce Department to
review the strategic, commercial and technological aspects of the
project and submit a combined report to the NSC by March 10.
   Levine testified at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., voiced
serious concern over the FSX deal, under which St. Louis-based
General Dynamics would join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to co-develop and co-produce the next-generation fighter.
   ``While this proposal may sound innocent, it could be troubling
as far as our long-range national security is concerned,'' he said.
   ``Today, President Bush is in Japan, paying his respects on the
death of of the emperor,'' he said. ``That is something he should
do. But making massive amounts of sophisticated aircraft technology
available to Japan, or anyone, is something that, quite possibly,
the president should not do.''
   Under current law, the NSC's permanent membership comprises the
president, vice president, secretary of state and secretary of
defense. Frequently, however, presidents designate other people as
temporary members to participate in meetings on particular issues.
   Two former Pentagon officials, testifying before the panel, took
differing positions on the advisability of going forward with the
FSX deal.
   James E. Auer, now director of the Center for U.S.-Japan Studies
and Cooperation at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., argued
that Japan needs technologically superior fighters to help offset
the threat posed by the Soviet Union's Far East force of 2,000
aircraft.
   Auer, who in 1979-88 served in the office of the assistant
secretary of defense for international security affairs, also said
the United States stands to benefit from the FSX because
``state-of-the-art Japanese technology may well make the F-16 a
better aircraft.''
   Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security Policy,
a Washington-based think tank, said he saw no new Japanese
technology from which the United States should benefit.
   ``I, for one, am not persuaded that the co-cured composite wings
and phased array radar technologies identified for `flow-back' to
the United States under the FSX deal meet that test,'' said Gaffney,
former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear forces and
arms control policy.

<HEAD>Tax Panel Rejects Bush Proposals on Medicare, Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee quickly
turned down President Bush's proposals to trim Medicare costs by $5
billion and halve the capital gains tax rate.
   The panel, which has jurisdiction over tax and entitlement
legislation, on Thursday approved a report by voice vote which said
it has no intention of approving either of those requests from the
new president.
   ``While the committee will work diligently in this area, it is
not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the
level of reductions proposed by the administration in the Medicare
program for fiscal year 1990,'' the committee report said.
   The report did not mention the capital gains tax directly, but
nonetheless made clear the committee backed the position of Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., that Bush's proposal would violate the
spirit of fairness in the income tax overhaul Congress approved in
1986.
   ``While it may be appropriate for the committee to examine
selective income tax issues in the 101st Congress, the committee
does not anticipate consideration of major income tax changes or
re-opening of any fundamental feature of the 1986 Tax Reform Act,''
Thursday's report said.
   Bush has proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains about in
half, to 15 percent, contending the government would actually take
in more money at the lower rate because of increased economic
activity.
   Democrats and many economists say the proposal would be a revenue
loser and a giveaway to the rich.
   Congressional analysts released a new estimate Thursday showing
that after an initial jump in revenue next year, cutting the capital
gains tax would reduce tax collections and cost the government $24.2
billion over the next six years.
   ``After an initial, and illusory, revenue gain, the president's
proposal is shown for what it is, a tax break for the wealthy that
will significantly increase the deficit,'' said Rostenkowski, in a
statement calling for Bush to withdraw the proposal. ``It's a bad
idea and should be discarded,'' he said.
   The administration and Congress agree the cost of Medicare has
been soaring as the elderly population increases and medical fees
grow faster than the general rate of inflation. Without restraints,
the program would grow from $84.5 billion this year to $97.5 billion
next year, according to White House estimates.
   In an effort to contain costs, Bush in his $1.16 trillion budget
proposed holding Medicare spending to $92.5 billion next year by
imposing limits on payments to hospitals and doctors who treat
Medicare patients, and by cutting back the program's extra payments
to teaching hospitals.
   ``If these modest reforms are adopted, the growth in Medicare
payments between 1989 and 1990 will be reduced by $5 billion,'' the
budget said.
   The committee, however, said it was not reasonable to expect
either providers or recipients of Medicare to absorb the level of
reductions proposed by the president, totalling $23.5 billion over
three years.
   The new estimate on the capital gains tax, made by the staff of
the Joint Committee on Taxation, differs sharply from White House
estimates that the president's proposal would increase revenues by
$9.3 billion during the 1989-94 period.
   ``Who's right?'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, in a statement Thursday. ``That's the
first thing we'll have to determine when the Finance Committee takes
this matter up.''
   Unlike Rostenkowski, who opposes any change in the rate, Bentsen
has indicated he could live with a reduction in the capital-gains
rate if the upper-income taxpayers who would benefit most were made
to pay elsewhere for the cut.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale property such as stocks
and real estate. Before the 1986 law, they had preferential
treatment in the tax code but now they are taxed the same as other
income at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending
on total income.

<HEAD>Proposed Rule Change Would Speed Nuclear Plant Licensing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rule change being considered by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission could help electric utilities get approval for
new nuclear plants in half the time it currently takes, NRC chairman
Lando W. Zech Jr. said in an interview.
   Zech said the proposed change could be approved by the commission
as early as next month.
   The licensing reform idea is strongly supported by the utility
industry, which blames regulatory barriers for its current financial
problems. Environmental groups oppose the change, saying it would
limit their ability to challenge applications for construction
permits and operating licenses.
   ``This would be a giant step forward,'' Zech said in an interview
in his NRC office.
   He declined to speculate on whether the four other commissioners
would vote for the rule change, which he said does not require
congressional approval. The commisioners were briefed on the
inch-thick document by their staff on Wednesday.
   Zech said he had not yet studied the document in enough detail to
be sure he would support the plan, but he repeatedly expressed
enthusiasm for such changes.
   The plan would make three major changes in the licensing process:
   _Allow utilities to get federal approval for a plant site long
before committing themselves to actually building on it.
   _Encourage manufacturers to develop standardized reactor designs.
This would allow utilities to choose a design already certified by
the NRC and not requiring the current lengthy process of gaining
design approval during the licensing process.
   _Permitting utilities to get their plant construction permit at
the same time as their operating license. Currently this is a
two-step process, and in some cases completed plants have stood idle
because of failure to get an operating permit.
   ``The most important thing about this whole endeavor is to do as
much up front in the whole licensing process as possible so you
don't have big major decisions for after the plant's been built,''
Zech said.
   He said utilities would be able to get plants built and licensed
within six years, and possibly sooner, compared with the recent
average of 13 years.
   The utility industry contends that long delays in obtaining NRC
licenses is one reason that no new nuclear plants have been ordered
since the mid-1970s. Zech said that with the rule change, some
orders might be placed in the early 1990s.
   James D. Watkins, the Bush administration's designated energy
secretary, told his confirmation hearing Wednesday that streamlining
the nuclear plant licensing process ``could get things moving, could
relieve the kind of constipation we have in the process now.''
   Environmental groups, however, have been critical of the
regulatory reform proposals.
   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, which is strongly critical of the industry and the
NRC, said the rule changes would unfairly limit the public's right
to fight a plant licensing. He said the main purpose of the changes
was to aid the nuclear industry.
   ``For them there is no future without'' the streamlined process,
Mariotte said in a recent interview, adding that his group might
challenge the plan in court.

<HEAD>Bush S&amp;L Plan Facing Stiff Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan to close or merge
insolvent savings and loan institutions over the next 30 years at a
cost of $265 billion is encountering stiff opposition in Congress.
   After reading the 333-page bill submitted this week, both
Democrats and Republicans who support a separate S&amp;L industry
devoted primarily to home mortgages doubt it can survive under
Bush's proposal.
   ``There are too many officials within the administration who
would just as soon see the home mortgage lending industry done away
with,'' said Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., and chairman of the House
Banking Committee's financial institutions subcommittee.
   Annunzio predicted that interest rates on home loans will rise
dramatically if federally chartered S&amp;Ls are allowed to disappear,
because the remaining financial institutions will not give such
loans a high priority.
   That concern was bolstered Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who said his board is making it easier for bank
holding companies to buy troubled S&amp;Ls and questioned ``whether
specialized fixed-rate residential lending institutions are needed
today.''
   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said
that whatever survives will not be the traditional S&amp;L that relied
on short-term deposits from savers to finance long-term, fixed-rate
mortgages.
   ``My own judgment is that, at the end of the day, thrifts will
look a lot more like banks than they do now, but there will still be
thrifts,'' he said. ``Ultimately it's going to be the markets that
are going to determine the banking structure in this country.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, testifying Thursday before the
House Banking Committee, defended that ``market approach'' and said
the Bush administration will stoutly resist congressional efforts to
re-regulate S&amp;Ls by further restricting their lending activities.
   The failure of many S&amp;Ls has been blamed on imprudent and
sometimes fraudulent loans for shopping centers, office buildings
and other high-risk ventures after Congress deregulated the industry
in the early 1980s.
   Annunzio, with the backing of the industry, said he will try to
amend Bush's proposal to restrict 80 percent of future S&amp;L lending
to family housing within a 50-mile radius of each institution.
   He complained that Bush's plan requiring S&amp;L owners to put up
more of their own capital to cover losses for non-residential
lending ``doesn't stop the crooks, it just makes them pay more to do
business.''
   Brady said Annunzio's proposal would put S&amp;Ls ``back into the
same box that we took them out of'' through deregulation when they
had to pay more interest on deposits than they were receiving on
home mortgages.
   He predicted that more of them would go bankrupt as a result,
even while acknowledging that the healthiest third of the industry
contains precisely those S&amp;Ls that have maintained their emphasis on
home mortgages.
   The administration's plan would require S&amp;Ls with less than 60
percent of their loans in residential housing to become banks
eventually.
   It also would place them under the control of federal banking
regulators for the first time, require them to meet the 6 percent
capital-to-asset requirements of banks within two years, and open
the way for banks to take over failed S&amp;Ls immediately and healthy
ones after two years.
   ``Rather than heal wounds, your plan may actually put it (the S&amp;L
industry) out of its misery,'' Rep. Richard Lehman, D-Calif., told
Brady. ``The banking regulators are going to make S&amp;Ls look more
like banks and I'm concerned about the effect of that on housing.''
   Brady denied any ``intention on our part to deliver up the S&amp;L
industry to the banking industry'' after contending earlier that
Bush's plan ``assures the emergence of a healthy and strong S&amp;L
industry.''
   Meanwhile, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve, as the nation's
lender of last resort, has entered into a support arrangement with
the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which lends to S&amp;Ls.
   ``We stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the
thrift institutions are met,'' Greenspan said, referring to the
record $15 billion in deposits that were withdrawn from them in
November and December.
   Greenspan also said Bush's financing proposal for protecting S&amp;L
depositors against losses ``should be adequate'' but conceded ``it's
conceivable that there would be the need for a minor mid-course
correction in a year or two.''
   According to figures released Thursday by the Office of
Management and Budget, Bush's plan calls for spending $265 billion
through 2018:
   _$52.2 billion to meet commitments made last year to rescue 205
institutions and prop up 17 others.
   _$50 billion to shut down 350 more insolvent but still open S&amp;Ls
through 1991.
   _$89.2 billion through 2018 to pay the government's share of the
interest on bonds sold to borrow the $50 billion.
   _$73.4 billion to take care of additional S&amp;Ls likely to slip
into insolvency between 1991 and 2018.

   President Bush's trip to Japan is leading to
renewed calls in Congress for the island nation to share more of the
burden for regional defense in the Pacific.
   ``Our defense effort is 9.2 times greater than the Japanese
effort, based upon the share of our respective gross national
products we devote to defense,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said
Thursday. ``The American taxpayer is wondering whether this division
of effort is fair any longer.''
   D'Amato said Defense Department figures showed that the United
States spent $3.7 billion to maintain forces in Japan in fiscal year
1985, and $5 billion the following. Those figures were the latest
available, though costs have undoubtedly risen, he said.
   While the Japanese have announced their 1989 defense budget will
increase by $1.56 billion to $31.6 billion over the previous year,
D'Amato said expenditures are actually declining as a proportion of
Japan's GNP.
   Bush was in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito on
Thursday. He has stepped gingerly when addressing the military
spending issue, saying that Japan is making adequate contributions
to regional defense but that any moves to do more will be welcomed
by the United States.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said
the Japanese are ``well on their way'' to building up a force
capable of defending the sea lanes out to 1,000 miles.
   But Tokyo's military is no match for the Soviets, who ``operate
literally in Japan's back yard,'' he said.
   Although the Japanese have done much to increase defense
spending, ``I believe they can and should do more,'' he said.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, was more outspoken.
   ``I'm getting sick of everyone trying to soak Uncle Sam,'' he
said, describing the United States as ``guarantor of stability
throughout the world.''
   McClure said the American military presence is vital to Japan's
security, yet Washington bears many additional expenses in the
Pacific including those of maintaining 44,000 troops in Korea and
military bases in the Philippines.
   McClure said he thinks the United States should be given space
for overseas bases rent-free so long as Washington provides the
troops and supplies.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., questioned the need to keep U.S.
troops in Korea, hinting that some might be withdrawn if the Senate
faces tough budget choices.
   ``I haven't figured out what the 44,000 troops are there for,''
he said.
   But Hardisty said a reduction of troops ``at this time would be
premature'' in light of the continued threat from North Korea.

   Midway through an extraordinary 2{-hour Armed
Services Committee session, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said ``there
may not be a smoking gun, but there's an abundance of smoke'' where
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower is concerned.
   Within moments, Wyoming's Malcolm Wallop uttered the scornful
Republican reply: ``There may not be a smoking gun, but there's
plenty of smoke. That's a strange standard, my friends.''
   Added the most junior senator on the committee, Republican Dan
Coats of Indiana: ``We are establishing a new standard ... that the
weight of allegations, or of public perception, carries more weight
than the facts.''
   By the time the Democratic-controlled panel assembled in a packed
Senate hearing room late Thursday, the outcome was already clear:
Tower's nomination would be sent to the floor with a recommendation
against confirmation, with the full Senate to decide its fate next
week.
   But that didn't stop all 20 members of the Armed Services
Committee from participating in an exercise in speechmaking Thursday
night as they struggled to explain their decisions.
   Republicans voiced alarm at a process in which so many lawmakers
could read the same FBI investigation files on Tower's alleged
drinking, womanizing and financial conflicts of interest, and come
to diametrically opposite conclusions along party lines.
   ``It seems that these things were orchestrated by somebody,''
said an exasperated Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., his voice rising.
   ``It is perception that is frightening this committee, it's not
the truth,'' Thurmond said. ``This committee ought to have the
courage to do what is right. Perception should not control this
committee... It ought to be the truth.''
   Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., listened intently, reminding
the members that it was President Bush himself who ``put ethics at
the center of his agenda,'' and he said the decision on Tower had
``genuinely torn'' members of the panel.
   But ultimately, said Nunn, stories of Tower's drinking were too
serious to ignore.
   ``I have searched in vain for several weeks for the point in time
when the nominee himself acknowledged this problem and dealt with it
decisively,'' he said. ``The nominee made it very clear that he has
never sought medical assistance for his drinking problem.''
   Other Democrats put different emphasis on the various allegations
against Tower, but all said the end result was that they could not
comfortably vote to put him in the chain of command over the
nation's military and nuclear forces.
   They pointed to the FBI reports, saying the documents indicated
Tower's acknowledged heavy drinking in the 1970s had extended into
more recent times and that the evidence included first-person
accounts.
   ``We should look elsewhere for a secretary of defense,'' said
Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., acknowledging that the confirmation process
had been personally painful to Tower. ``The system may not always be
fair, but it works.''
   Several Republicans, however, sounded a common theme: that in
Tower's 24 years in the Senate, none of his legislative colleagues
ever saw him out of control, even in all-night sessions and on long
overseas trips.
   ``I suppose John Tower might have been able to conceal a
problem'' from his colleagues, said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.
``But it's highly unlikely.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the committee's senior Republican,
said he had interviewed every current senator who had served with
Tower. ``Not one single U.S. senator ... can ever recall a single
instance where any of his personal habits interfered with his
duty,'' Warner said.
   Republicans also emphasized Bush's right to select his Cabinet
nominees, and said they gave a heavier weight to the new president's
wishes. Only eight presidential nominees for Cabinet positions have
been rejected by the Senate in the nation's history.
   GOP committee members also suggested it was hypocritical for
senators to reject a former colleague over his drinking habits. ``I
wonder how many of us in this room would admit to the same
proclivity, to have a social drink?'' asked Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``This is not a canonization.''
   Emerging from the hearing room after the vote, Republicans warned
that the debate, at least, was not over.
   ``This is probably worth discussing and debating on the floor,''
said Cohen. ``There is a man here whose reputation has been dragged
through the mire, and Republicans feel strongly about it... I think
it's a bad storm rising.''

   A military jury on Friday
convicted a U.S. Navy captain of dereliction of duty for failing to
help a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who later resorted to
cannibalism to survive _ then spared him a harsh sentence.
   Capt. Alexander Balian, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran,
was sentenced to a reprimand. He could have been jailed for 90 days
and ordered to forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months.
   The jury acquitted Balian, 48, of the more serious charge of
ordering one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard
the warship.
   ``This court martial sentences you to be reprimanded,'' said the
jury foreman, Capt. William Fox, after deliberating the sentence for
about a half hour. Under military law, court martial convictions are
automatically reviewed.
   The jury of six Navy captains deliberated nearly six hours
Thursday and Friday before returning a verdict.
   Balian, of Los Angeles, had been on trial since Feb. 10.
   He was stripped of his command of the amphibious landing ship USS
Dubuque after being accused of failing to render adequate assistance
to more than 80 Vietnamese boat people when the Dubuque encountered
them June 9 in the South China Sea, 230 miles north of the
Philippine island of Palawan.
   U.N. officials said 31 of the Vietnamese died after encountering
the Dubuque. Survivors said they resorted to cannibalism to survive
before Filipino fishermen rescued them on June 27.
   The jury found Balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing
to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat; determine
whether their sail was adequate; conduct appropriate medical
examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees; provide necessary
navigational equipment; provide adequate food and clothing to the
naked, and take refugees aboard or see to it that they were taken
aboard or assisted by a Navy supply ship in the area.
   The jury found Balian innocent of charges that he ordered the
Dubuque's crew to shake off a refugee who tried to climb aboard the
warship using the vessel's monkeylines.
   On Feb. 16, Balian was acquitted of a third charge _ failing to
render assistance to a Vietnamese who drowned.
   The prosecution contended Balian abandoned the refugees in his
rush to resume his voyage to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Providing humanitarian assistance is a mission of the U.S.
Navy,'' the prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Raymond Carlson, said during
closing arguments. ``It was not Capt. Balian's mission. It was an
interruption to his mission.''
   Carlson said the Vietnamese left their homeland May 22 ``with the
aim of escaping to freedom.'' They planned a four-day voyage to
Malaysia but were stranded when their engine broke down after three
days at sea, he said.
   Food ran out and about 20 Vietnamese had already died when they
encountered the Dubuque, he said.
   Carlson said Balian pressed his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr.
Stanley Halter, to rush through an inspection of the refugee boat.
   Balian testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did
not realize how desperate their situation was. Balian also testified
that he believed the vessel was seaworthy based on reports from
Halter.
   ``Only a fool would think this vessel could effectively sail
anywhere,'' said Carlson, holding a photo of the boat jammed with
emaciated Vietnamese.
   ``Only a fool can think these people are not in a
life-endangering situation. Only a fool could really think food and
water were all that was needed in this situation.''
   In his summation, defense lawyer Dan Donato urged the jury to
consider that Balian ``was honestly mistaken'' about conditions on
the boat.
   ``It was a tragedy of errors,'' Donato said. ``If the skipper had
learned there were ... dead bodies ... if he had known people were
sick, he would have taken different actions. If he had known there
was an inoperable engine, he would have taken a different action.''
   Donato also said Balian was under pressure from his commanders to
reach the Persian Gulf on schedule. The Dubuque took part in U.S.
security operations in the gulf during the final weeks of the
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Capt. Balian was told to be there,'' Donato said. ``He was
told, `Don't be late.'''

   President Bush attended Emperor Hirohito's funeral
Friday, taking a front-row seat as the Japanese waived protocol
rules to give him a prominent position at the solemn Shinjuku
Imperial Garden ceremony.
   In the hours preceding the funeral, Bush's attention was diverted
by the continuing problems of Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower. The White House, despite heavy overseas calling, was unable
to get the former Texas senator approved by the Senate Armed
Services Committee in Washington. It voted 11-9 to reject his
nomination.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that
Bush was sticking by Tower, no matter how the committee vote went.
``The next step is to consider it on the floor, and that's what we
will do,'' he said.
   A steady rain fell and the weather was chilly as Bush and
dignitaries from some 160 countries gathered for the funeral
ceremony.
   Bush was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire in World War
II, but said coming to the funeral was ``the right thing to do'' and
that he didn't want to look back.
   Wearing dark mourning clothes and a black overcoat with the
collar raised, Bush was seated with his wife, Barbara, on his right
and West German President Richard von Weizsacker on his left.
   The floor below them was heated with electrical coils, and a
brown wool blanket was placed on each chair.
   En route to the funeral site, Bush's motorcade crossed an
overpass just as the funeral procession containing Hirohito's hearse
proceeded immediately below.
   During the briefing at the White House press filing center,
Fitzwater said that U.S. officials hoped the Japanese would not be
offended by Bush's preoccupation with the Tower problem in
Washington.
   Fitzwater said Bush's attention to his embattled Cabinet
secretary should not be construed by the Japanese as showing
disrepect for their country on a national day of mourning.
   ``The timing is dictated by the work of the committee, not events
over here,'' the press secretary said.
   More than 10,000 invited mourners from Japan and abroad were
assembled at the Shinjuku Imperial Garden. Bush unexpectedly was
given a front-row seat as Japanese officials overrode protocol that
would have seated the president on the basis of his time in office _
just a little over a month.
   Hirohito, the last of the World War II era world leaders, died
Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87 after reigning for six decades.
   After the funeral, Bush returned to his hotel and was there when
an explosion damaged a highway along which the emperor's hearse was
due to be taken after the cermony. Police speculated that radicals
opposed to the emperor system were responsible for the blast.
   In a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on
Thursday, Bush ``began by expressing the condolences of the American
people'' upon Hirohito's death, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Absent from the public ceremonies was Empress Dowager Nagako,
Hirohito's 85-year-old wife, who is said to be ailing with chronic
back and hip problems. The Kyodo News Agency said she paid her last
respects during the palace ceremonies.
   Bush and his wife walked together to the site of Hirohito's
coffin and bowed in paying last respects, just before leaving the
funeral grounds.
   No disturbances were reported during the initial stages of
Friday's funeral, but a police official in the southern city of
Nagasaki said a letter containing a bullet and a death threat was
sent to city mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, who had earlier charged that
Hirohito bore some responsiblity for World War II.
   During the news briefing earlier, Fitzwater denied that Bush and
White House chief of staff John Sununu had discussed finding another
candidate for the top Pentagon job.
   ``I can flatly say that. I do flatly say that,'' he said. ``I've
talked to the president about that several times, including just 10
minutes ago. There's no consideration of alternative candidates.
There's no alternate list _ bar none.''
   Bush on Thursday held talks with three Mideast leaders, while
Secretary of State James A. Baker III challenged the Soviet Union to
pitch in with deeds instead of ``simply rhetorical exercises.''
   Bush's fast-paced diplomacy on the day of his arrival here
involved meetings with a succession of world leaders including
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli President Chaim Herzog and
Jordan's King Hussein.
   After Bush's round of meetings, Baker suggested the Soviets
should contribute to the peace process in a ``concrete way'' by
establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel, using its
influence in Syria and denouncing ``radical countries'' such as
Libya.
   Baker said a ``new dynamic'' for peace existed in the area and
that Bush hoped to nurture it. The president's sessions with Mideast
leaders provided a counterpoint to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze's 10-day tour through the region, where he attempted to
advance Moscow's role.
   First lady Barbara Bush, meanwhile, donned a tailored black suit
and an elegant strand of pearls to pay a visit Naoko Takeshita, the
wife of the Japanese prime minister.
   The two women sipped tea at Takeshita's official residence, with
Mrs. Bush expressing sympathy over Hirohito's death and the Mrs.
Takeshita offering congratulations on Bush's election as president.
   Bush's focus on the Middle East during his first overseas trip _
a five-day visit to three Asian capitals _ appeared to be an effort
to steal some of the spotlight from Shevardnadze's journey to the
area.
   Baker, briefing reporters after Bush's full day of meetings with
world leaders, said Soviet overtures to participate in a Middle East
peace were ``healthy, quite frankly.''
   But, he added, ``I suppose we would want to know that there were
concrete contributions that they had in mind, rather than simply
rhetorical exercises.''
   He said he would have a better idea of what the Soviets intend
when he meets with Shevardnadze in March in Vienna.
   Baker said contributing to the new dynamics for peace were talks
between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization
and statements by PLO leader Yasser Arafat denouncing terrorism.
   He said the United States intended to be active in the peace
process.
   However, he said ultimately a settlement would have to flow from
``direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.''
   ``We are concerned that if we act too precipitously we might
preempt promising possibilities that could surface if we adopted a
more reasoned and measured approach,'' Baker added.
   Earlier, Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the subject
of a Middle East peace settlement also came up in a lunch with
French President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``We think there are some opportunities to move the (peace)
process forward,'' Fitzwater said. ``We want to be methodical and
deliberate in our approach.''
   On Cambodia, Bush voiced concern that the withdrawal of
Vietnamese there was proceeding ``at a slower pace than we would
like to see,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``President Bush also emphasized that we would like to see a
government in Cambodia that would involve Prince Sihanouk and would
not see a return to the power of the Khmer Rouge,'' the spokesman
said.

   An explosion Friday on a roadside embankment spilled
dirt and debris on a highway in suburban Tokyo shortly before the
motorcade carrying the body of Emperor Hirohito and the imperial
family was to pass, police said.
   The incident did not stop the funeral motorcade, which passed the
site later en route to the imperial mausoleums outside Tokyo where
the emperor was to be buried, said an official of the Metropolitan
Police Department.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. showed workers sweeping dirt off a
section of six-line divided expressway in the western suburb of
Chofu where the highway runs below ground level.
   The police official said the blast occurred about 15 minutes
after the imperial motorcade left the funeral site in west-central
Tokyo. It was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was
when the blast occurred.
   Police had mounted the biggest security operation ever in Japan
to protect the grand state funeral and about 9,000 mourners,
including President Bush and leaders from 162 other nations,
attending the funeral.
   The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
suspected radical guerrillas opposed to the imperial system were
responsible for the blast.
   Several radical groups had vowed to disrupt the funeral.
   In 1986, about 30,000 police on duty during the seven-nation
economic summit were unable to prevent guerrillas from firing two
homemade projectiles at the Tokyo summit site. No damage or injuries
resulted, but the attack seriously embarrassed the police.
   On Tuesday police said they found two projectile-launchers
connected to timers in a forest near Narita Airport, 35 miles north
of Tokyo, where many foreign dignitaries arrived to attend the
funeral.

<HEAD>Justice Department Files Brief in Missouri Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says the Supreme Court
should overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision because nothing
in the Constitution guarantees the right to an abortion and such
decisions should be left up to the states.
   ``Other Western countries have, through the legislative process,
reached reasonable accommodations of the competing interests
involved in the abortion controversy,'' acting Solicitor General
William C. Bryson wrote in a brief filed Thursday with the high
court.
   ``There is no reason to believe that American legislatures, if
basic decision-making responsibility were returned to them, would
not similarly arrive at humane solutions,'' he said.
   The brief, supporting the state of Missouri's position in a case
before the court known as Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
said the case ``represents'' a proper occasion to reconsider Roe vs.
Wade.
   But the brief also acknowledged that the Supreme Court could rule
on the Missouri case without touching the 1973 decision that
legalized abortion.
   Bryson wrote that the Roe vs. Wade rests on the premise that
``there is a fundamental right to an abortion'' and that states ``do
not have a compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life
throughout pregnancy.''
   ``Neither premise, however, is supportable,'' the brief said.
   Abortion rights and civil liberties groups condemned the
department's action, while it was lauded by pro-life advocates.
   ``We're also appalled at the strength of the language, saying
women do not have a constitutional right to make their own personal
decisions about reproduction,'' said Tamar Abrams, a spokeswoman for
the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union contended
that there is a constitutional right to an abortion.
   ``What Roe vs. Wade clarified was that the decision is a matter
of privacy and that right is protect in the Constitution'' through
the 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and
seizure, O'Connor said.
   On the other hand, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the
National Right to Life Committee, said in a statement that ``we
applaud this intervention by the Bush Administration in defense of
unborn children.''
   The Missouri case went to the Supreme Court after the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on July 13 rejected key portions of the
Missouri law.
   About 20 briefs were filed in support of the Missouri law
Thursday, the deadline for such briefs on that side of the issue.
Advocates of the right to an abortion have another 30 days to file
briefs.
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   In the Missouri case, the appellate court struck down these five
provisions of the law:
   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to
be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to
determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''
   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans
the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.
But it said use of a public facility or the services of a public
employee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a
patient.

   The shades of Roger Taney, Caleb Cushing and
Lewis B. Strauss are being invoked as the Senate struggles once more
with its constitutional power to advise and consent on nominations
to the president's Cabinet.
   This time the spotlight is on John Tower, President Bush's
embattled choice to be secretary of defense.
   Eight times in history, according to files of the Library of
Congress and the Senate Library, presidents have failed to win
Senate confirmation for people they had chosen to sit in the Cabinet.
   The last time was on Jan. 19, 1959, when the Senate voted 49-46
to reject President Dwight D. Eisenhower's selection of Strauss to
be secretary of commerce.
   Strauss had survived by a vote of 9-8 in the Senate Commerce
Committee but had made too many enemies in Congress as chairman of
the Atomic Energy Commission to clear the full Senate.
   In 1945, by contrast, the same committee rejected the nomination
of Henry A. Wallace as secretary of commerce by a vote of 14-5 on
Jan. 26, but the full Senate approved it 56-32 on March 1.
   Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones, who had been asked by FDR to
step down to make way for Wallace, opposed confirmation of the
controversial former vice president and secretary of agriculture.
Wallace had the backing, however, of organized labor.
   It was the last time a Senate committee rejected a Cabinet
nomination before the Armed Services Committee voted Thursday to
reject the Tower appointment.
   The first president to have a Cabinet choice vetoed by the Senate
was Andrew Jackson, whose choice of Taney to be secretary of the
treasury was turned down on June 23, 1834. Taney, who was already
serving in the post by a recess appointment, was later named chief
justice by Jackson and confirmed for that post by the Senate.
   President John Tyler, whose relations with Congress were soured
by his vetoes of major pieces of legislation, had four Cabinet
choices rejected. His selection of Cushing to be secretary of the
treasury was defeated three times in one day - March 3, 1843.
   Tyler later nominated James S. Green for the treasury post and he
was rejected on June 15, 1844. The Senate also rejected his
nominations of James Madison Porter for secretary of war on June 30,
1844, and David Henshaw for secretary of the Navy on Jan. 15, 1844.
   Also rejected by the Senate was President Andrew Johnson's
selection of Henry Stanberry to be attorney general in 1868.
   President Calvin Coolidge's nomination of Charles B. Warren as
attorney general was rejected twice, on March 10 and again on March
16, 1925.

<HEAD>Lawyer Criticizes Thornburgh Involvement in IRA Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney for an Irish Republican Army member
convicted in Britain of killing a British soldier says he's dismayed
that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has injected himself into the
controversy over whether his client should be granted political
asylum.
   ``It's just more delay,'' said Stephen A. Somerstein, a New
York-based attorney for Joe Doherty. ``The delay already has been
interminable, and he's been incarcerated all through this. The
length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of fairness, of
reasonableness.''
   Doherty has been in federal prison in Manhattan since FBI agents
arrested him June 28, 1983, at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan, where he
worked as a part-time bartender after breaking out of a maximum
security prison in Northern Ireland more than six years ago.
   Thornburgh got involved in the case Thursday at the request of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which wants to deport
Doherty, said Dave Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general.
   At issue is a Board of Immigration Appeals decision last Nov. 14
that Doherty could reopen his request for political asylum in the
United States and remanding that request to an INS judge.
   If Thornburgh had not gotten involved, Doherty could have pursued
his case with the judge, Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller
said.
   Since the attorney general can modify or overrule decisions of
the board, Thornburgh could decide to deny Doherty asylum without an
INS judge hearing the case.
   ``We had requested that the attorney general not review it and
just allow us our day in court to press our political asylum claim
that the board said we should have,'' Somerstein said in a telephone
interview.
   ``It's tantamount to his being a judge in his own case,'' he said.
   Doherty was convicted with three others of the killing that
occurred during a gunfight between British soldiers and IRA members
who had planned to ambush a British Army patrol in 1980.
   He contends he is neither a terrorist nor a murderer, but a
soldier engaged in war, and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that
he would be subject to persecution if sent to Britain.
   On Thursday, Thornburgh ordered that INS submit by March 27 a
brief in support of its position. After that, Doherty will have 30
days to submit a brief arguing his case, and then the INS will have
14 days to file a reply.
   The British have been seeking Doherty's return to Britain since
1983, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the issue with
then-President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.
   U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn denied Britain's
extradition request in December 1984, saying Doherty's crime was a
political act and qualified him for political asylum.
   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight
ruled in Doherty's favor. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
upheld Doherty's previous victories.
   Then the Justice Department began deportation proceedings.
   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,
Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland. Immigration Judge
Howard I. Cohen upheld that decision in 1986.
   Since then, the government has appealed three times and lost each
time, the most recent loss coming last Nov. 14.
   Doherty asked the Board of Immigration Appeals to revoke his
concession that he was deportable after Ireland in December 1987
ratified the European Convention on Terrorism. The convention calls
for mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists and would have
meant that Doherty would have been extradited from Ireland to
Britain.

   Bob Harvell is so angry he would raise the roof
if he had one.
   The trouble is, someone razed his house, and now he says he can't
find the contractor who reduced the home to a pile of rubble.
   Harvell said he hired an Arizona contractor simply to level the
dirt around his house and push a fence down. Instead, his house,
valued at $80,000 to $90,000, was demolished recently by the errant
contractor.
   When he found out his house was being leveled, he ran to the man
doing the work, Harvell said.
   ``The smell of liquor on his breath almost knocked me down,''
Harvell said. ``The man just kept saying `I'm leveling, I'm
leveling.'
   ``He was drunk and said `All right, there is no problem. I'll get
my business partner and insurance papers and I'll be back in 15
minutes.' I never saw him again.''
   Harvell has yet to find the contractor, and police can't locate
him.
   Now he has retained an attorney and hired a private investigator
to track down the contractor.
   Harvell wanted the lawn leveled so he could put in a sprinkling
system and a new lawn.
   Rick Muchmore, who lives in the house, said he left to get some
groceries and returned to find a heap.
   He said when he left ``the tractor was out front but the house
was fine and all three doors were locked. When we returned the house
was gone.''
   A next-door neighbor, Carol Garcia, said she saw the house being
mowed down.
   ``I knew that the owner owned a business and since this area is
becoming a business district, we thought the owner was going to turn
it into a construction yard or something,'' she said. ``But then I
saw a bed and I thought something strange was going on.''

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is drawing the
Islamic curtain around Iran again, dragging it back into the
self-imposed isolation from which more pragmatic leaders were
seeking to lead it.
   His call on Moslems to kill British author Salman Rushdie for
allegedly slandering Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has
alienated Iran at a time when figures like Parliament Speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani were trying to present a more moderate image of
Iran to the world.
   Western countries were horrified when Iranian clerics last week
offered a bounty of up to $5.2 million for the assassination of
Rushdie, who has gone into hiding with police protection in Britain.
   The denunciation by Khomeini of moves to normalize relations with
the West and of demands for political, social and religious reform
now that the war with Iraq has ended came on the heels of criticisms
of the Islamic revolution's shortcomings by several rival Iranian
leaders.
   ``He's happy when it's fortress Iran, surrounded by enemies,''
said Philip Robbins, an Iran analyst with the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London.
   Shahram Chubin, an Iran specialist with the Institute for
International Affairs in Geneva, said the Western reaction to Iran's
fury over ``The Satanic Verses'' has ``reinforced Khomeini's belief
that Iran is surrounded by a sea of corruption and conspiracies.
   ``It was perfect for him. Khomeini clearly thinks there's still
some mileage out of a militant stand against the superpowers,''
Chubin said in a telephone interview.
   The moves by Khomeini, 88, are a major setback for the
pragmatists, particularly Rafsanjani, and a boost for hard-liners
who feared Rafsanjani was getting too powerful and believed
restoring ties to the West would undermine the revolution.
   The 12 European Common Market countries have recalled their
ambassadors to protest the death threats against Rushdie while
Khomeini, and Iran's hard-liners, have accused the West of ganging
up on Islam and Iran in particular.
   Sweden and Norway also pulled their ambassadors out of Tehran.
Iran retaliated by withdrawing all its envoys from Common Market
capitals.
   The British, who only normalized relations with Tehran in
December after a lengthy dispute, recalled their diplomats from
Tehran and said they will not return until the Iranians rescind
their threats against Rushdie ``and reject all forms of violence.''
   West Germany, Iran's main European trading partner, has suspended
plans to provide economic aid to Iran to help with postwar
reconstruction and canceled scheduled visits by senior government
officials.
   The Bonn Parliament branded Khomeini's order to kill Rushdie a
``declaration of war'' against Western culture that the
revolutionary patriarch has so often denounced as morally repugnant.
   Hundreds of Dutch writers have called on their government to
sever relations with Tehran. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Hans van
den Broek, called off a planned visit to Tehran to protest ``an act
of international terrorism.''
   Khomeini declared Wednesday that the West's action in allowing
``The Satanic Verses'' to be published in the first place and their
subsequent diplomatic moves proved that it was wrong for Iran to
have tried to reestablish links.
   But Robbins and other analysts questioned how long Khomeini can
afford to keep Iran alienated from countries that it will need to
help its massive reconstruction program that will cost an estimated
$400 billion.
   It is money that Iran, exhausted by its 8-year Persian Gulf war
and poor economic condition, does not have and is not likely to have
for years to come.
   ``But the real problem remains the power struggle within the
hierachy,'' Chubin said.
   ``Khomeini has slapped Rafsanjani down to size. But Khomeini has
been playing both sides, being very equivocal and hasn't been
decisive on important issues such as the economy and the
constitution. He's been in a state of shock since he had to accept
the cease-fire,'' Chubin said.
   Robbins noted: ``One explanation is that he's siding with the
radicals on this one after they were weakened by Iran's failure to
defeat Iraq.
   ``He wants to keep an equilibrium between the opposing factions
to uphold his own authority. He doesn't want the revolution
diluted.''

   Soul singer Isaac Hayes has been cited for
contempt of court and jailed for being $346,300 behind in
child-support and alimony payments.
   Hayes, whose recordings include the score for the movie
``Shaft,'' was told Thursday by Superior Court Judge Philip F.
Etheridge that he can get out of jail only by coming up with $22,000.
   The judge said he jailed the entertainer, who lives in Marietta,
because of Hayes' repeated refusal to comply with court orders to
catch up and stay current on payments. Etheridge described the
amount of the past-due payments as ``categorically ridiculous and
almost beyond belief.''
   Hayes, 50, told the judge he has been financially strapped and
has not been able to schedule enough performances to make the amount
of money he needs to meet the $2,500 monthly court-ordered payments.
   He added that he doesn't like ``to have to struggle and scrape.''
   ``And I don't like coming down here and pouring out my soul to
this court,'' Hayes said, calling his jailing ``harassment.''

   The son of former United Nations Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick has been jailed for investigation of aggravated assault
involving a woman he was apparently living with, police said.
   Douglas Kirkpatrick, 32, was arrested Tuesday at the apartment of
an 18-year-old Phoenix woman who claimed she had been threatened
with a knife, police spokesman Sgt. Andy Anderson said Thursday.
   Kirkpatrick was reported missing several weeks ago from Sheppard
and Enoch Pratt Hospital, a private, 322-bed mental institution in
Towson, Md., just outside Baltimore, where Mrs. Kirkpatrick lives.
   During an initial appearance Thursday morning in Maricopa
County's Madison Street Jail, Kirkpatrick's bail was set at $8,220.
A jail official said bail was not posted and Kirkpatrick remained in
custody.
   Jail officials also scheduled a March 3 appearance date for the
defendant in Tolleson Justice Court.
   Anderson said Kirkpatrick apparently had been living at the
apartment of Nora Kaplan, the woman who called police.
   Gil Kleiner, a spokesman for the mental hospital, refused to
comment on Kirkpatrick's disappearance. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, reached at
her home, also declined to comment.

   Former South Carolina Rep. John Jenrette
intends to appeal his conviction on charges of shoplifting shoes
from a department store, despite a judge's finding that he is
``overwhelmingly'' guilty.
   Fairfax County, Va., Circuit Judge Donald B. McDonough on
Thursday found the former Abscam convict guilty of petty larceny and
altering price tags at Marshall's discount department store in
Tyson's Corner, Va., on Dec. 7.
   ``I find overwhelmingly, without a doubt, that he is guilty on
both charges,'' McDonough said after a 3{-hour trial.
   McDonough sentenced Jenrette to two concurrent 90-day jail terms
for each of the two misdemeanor charges, with 75 days suspended. The
judge also fined him $1,000 for each charge, with $500 suspended.
   Jenrette, a 52-year-old Democrat, got caught in the Abscam sting
operation in which FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks and businessmen
offered bribes to lawmakers. He was convicted in 1980 and sentenced
to two years in prison and five years' probation for bribery and
conspiracy charges. He served 13 months in prison and is on
probation.
   Kenneth Robinson, the attorney who represented Jenrette in the
Abscam trial as well as the shoplifting case, said he plans to
appeal. In the meantime, Jenrette was freed on personal bond.

   ``We thought it'd be fun. We thought it'd be hysterical,''
Kaminsky told the Post.
   He said he and his staff filled out 189 ballots nominating
Forrest Sawyer to replace Diane Sawyer, who is leaving the show to
join ABC. Kaminsky said he did it as a joke and without his client's
knowledge.
   After the bogus ballots were thrown out, the people's real choice
turned out to be NBC anchor Connie Chung. She got 49 of the 302
total votes.
   Forrest Sawyer got one reader's vote, the Post reported.

<HEAD>GAO Official Says Sanctions Don't Necessarily Indicate Degree of
Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge jump in disciplinary actions at the
Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange does not
necessarily indicate the degree of abuse by commodities traders, a
General Accounting Office official told Congress.
   Richard Fogel, assistant comptroller general at the GAO, an
agency that is an investigating and auditing arm of Congress, said
results of an FBI investigation into commodities trading may give a
better idea of abuse at the board and the exchange.
   The testimony came Thursday at the first Senate oversight hearing
of the year on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal
agency which faces reauthorization by Congress.
   The GAO says the number of contracts traded at the Mercantile
Exchange grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in 1988, and at
the Board of Trade from 80 million to 140 million during the same
period.
   In that same period, the number of traders sanctioned for
violations on the floor of the Mercantile Exchange went from 13 to
105, while sanctions at the Board of Trade went from a low of eight
in 1985 to a high of 32 in 1986. In 1988, the Board of Trade
sanctioned 13 floor participants.
   Fogel said that from 1984 to 1988, Mercantile Exchange fines for
trade practice abuses were a total $3.6 million. For the same
period, comparable Board of Trade fines were $811,000.
   Fogel told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the figures
could mean that an oversight system is working well, or that it
needs improvement because it is not finding abuses or punishing
offenders severely enough.
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., called the number of sanctions taken
against traders ``pitiful'' compared to the volume of trading.
   The number of members expelled on both exchanges averaged about
two a year, Fogel said. He said that according to exchange
officials, permanent expulsion or lengthy suspensions are viewed as
more severe than fines because they deprive members of their
livelihood.
   Fogel said commission officials told the GAO that they could not
comment on their involvement in identifying or investigating alleged
abuses until after any indictments stemming from the FBI probe are
issued.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee, said that

   Hirohito, the emperor-god made mortal by a
disastrous war, was honored Friday at a tradition-steeped state
funeral attended by the largest number of world leaders gathered
together in modern times.
   An explosion on a roadside embankment marred the day, spilling
dirt and debris on a highway shortly before the motorcade carrying
the emperor's body and the imperial family was to pass, police said.
   The motorcade, bound on a chilly, rainy day for the imperial
burial site west of Tokyo, passed the area where the blast occurred
without incident.
   Police said they suspected radicals who oppose the imperial
system were responsible. Several such groups had vowed to disrupt
the funeral, for which Japan's police mounted their biggest security
operation ever.
   At the funeral service, 51 black-robed bearers carried atop a
one-ton bier the body of the emperor who died in January at age 87
after a reign of 62 years that spanned Japan's rise to militarism,
its defeat in World War II and its ascent as a world economic power.
   ``The people will remember him forever,'' said his son and the
new emperor, Akihito, in a eulogy before leaders of 163 nations,
including President Bush.
   A deep-voiced male chorus sang a solemn song, a poem was read and
members of the imperial family went individually before the coffin
and bowed slowly.
   After the eulogies, Bush and his wife, Barbara, stepped to the
front of the hall, paused and made a slight bow before the coffin.
   The capital, a sprawling metropolis of 12 million people, came to
a standstill as 32,000 police were deployed to protect the
dignitaries.
   Police said the highway blast occurred about 15 minutes after the
imperial motorcade left the funeral site in west-central Tokyo. It
was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was at the time
of the blast.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Early in the day, a black hearse carrying the emperor's
lace-draped coffin drove at 6 mph through central Tokyo along a
four-mile route from the moated Imperial Palace to the funeral site
at Shinjuku Imperial Garden.
   Police said about 210,000 people lined the streets. Some people
cried as the motorcade passed, and others held their palms together
in prayer.
   Members of the royal family carried umbrellas in the streaming
rain and wind.
   Trailing the coffin, a chamberlain dressed in white carried a
platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased
monarch will wear to heaven.
   Mourners filled the two huge tents built at the garden for the
funeral.
   Officials overrode protocol to give Bush a front-row seat,
although tradition would have put him toward the back because of his
short time in office.
   Bush was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire in World War
II, but said he decided to come to the funeral because it was the
right thing to do because Japan and the United States are allies.
   Also bowing before the coffin was Britain's Prince Philip, a
Royal Navy veteran of World War II, who was present at Japan's
surrender ceremony in 1945.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said in his eulogy that Japan
``will continue to strive mightily to ensure that Japan is open to
the rest of the world, full of vigor, and culturally rich, and will
further promote the cause of world peace and human welfare.''
   He described Hirohito's reign as ``eventful and turbulent times
for Japan, including the calamities of that deplorable war, the
struggle to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and
dire poverty and to regain its full independence.''
   About 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered
peacefully at a park in west-central Tokyo, carrying banners
denouncing the funeral and branding Hirohito a ``war criminal.''
   ``Hirohito's war responsibility is great. He died without ever
resolving it,'' said a 30-year-old woman wearing a mask and
sunglasses at the rally.
   Historians generally agree that most of the decisions about the
war were made by Japan's military leaders and that Hirohito was
largely powerless. He relinquished his divine status under the
constitution imposed by the United States after the war.
   Hirohito was to be buried near the grave of his father, Emperor
Taisho, about 30 miles outside the city.
   Akihito, in a black tailcoat, black gloves and gray trousers, and
a black-veiled Empress Michiko were shielded by umbrellas as they
left the palace for the funeral motorcade.
   A 21-gun salute boomed from howitzers, mingling with ancient
court music played on pipes and drums. Crowds up to 10 deep watched
the motorcade as it pulled out of the main gate of the palace, moved
across the moat and along its route.
   The 13 hours of funeral ceremonies began with two hours of
private Shinto ceremonies presided over by the Akihito, 55, who
ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne after his father's death.
   The body of Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7, was encased in
an inner wooden coffin and an outer one of metal.
   Before the procession, officers joining the largest security
operation in Japanese history checked cars and patrolled streets.
   Absent from the public ceremonies was Empress Dowager Nagako,
Hirohito's 85-year-old wife, said to be ailing with back and hip
problems. The Kyodo News Agency said she paid her last respects
during the palace ceremonies.
   Stores in the Ginza shopping district covered their advertising
signs and display windows. Most businesses along the procession
route were closed.
   Many of the dignitaries used Thursday for mini-summit meetings.
They included Bush, who is on his first trip overseas as U.S. chief
executive.
   The government proclaimed Friday a holiday, asking Japanese to
``suitably mourn'' Hirohito and observe a minute of silence at noon.
   To mark the funeral, the government pardoned 30,000 people
convicted of minor criminal offenses.
   The pardons allow an additional 11 million people to recover such
civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office, which
they had lost as a punishment for their offenses.
   A 72-year-old farmer, Morie Hiroki, tried to commit suicide by
ritual disembowelment, or harakiri, in Kyushu in southern Japan,
police spokesman Kennosuke Kumae said by telephone.
   He said Hiroki, who slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife, was
in serious condition in the hospital. The spokesman said Hiroki had
served in China in World War II and left a note saying he felt he
had to follow the emperor in death.

<HEAD>Smoking Promotes Unhealthy Distribution Of Body Fat, Study Says</HEAD>

   People who smoke to control their weight are
simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for
potentially deadly illnesses, according to a study published today.
   Smoking does reduce weight, the researchers acknowledged, but
flab stays around the waist, increasing the chance for heart
disease, diabetes _ and early death.
   ``If you're a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in
order to control your body weight, or a non-smoker considering
starting up again ... you're making a bad decision,'' said Dr.
Reubin Andres, a co-author of the study and clinical director of the
National Institute on Aging in Baltimore.
   ``There's no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much
greater than the risk of a few (excess) pounds of body weight,'' he
said.
   Cigarette smokers generally weigh less for their height than
non-smokers and typically gain weight if they quit, the researchers
acknowledged in their report in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   But in looking at the ratio of waist size to hip size in men over
a period of 26 years, the researchers found that waist sizes
generally were larger in relation to hip size among smokers than
non-smokers.
   Mean measurements among smokers were 35.7 inches at the waist and
39 at the hips, compared with a mean ratio of 35.7 to 39.5 among
non-smokers, the researchers said.
   The more a person smokes, the larger the comparative waist size,
the study found.
   While the difference between the two ratios is small, Andres said
previous studies have indicated this can have a big effect on risks
of heart disease.
   ``If you are fortunate enough to be shaped with the fat down
around the hips, then you have a relatively safe form of obesity,''
Andres said. ``You are less likely to have high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and diabetes.
   ``It's simply one more bad effect of cigarette smoking _ as if
you needed one more bad effect.''
   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a
Washington-based group representing the tobacco industry, said he
had not seen the study and had no comment.
   How smoking causes differences in fat distribution is unclear,
Andres said, but cigarettes could affect hormones or could have a
drug-like effect on their own.
   Andres said no data on smoking and body-fat distribution is
available for women, but ``one can hypothesize that women will show
the same sort of changes'' as men.
   The researchers also found that when smokers in the study gave up
tobacco, they gained an average of five pounds, but the ratio of
waist size to hip size did not increase significantly.
   Ex-smokers who took up the habit again lost an average of 2.2
pounds, but the ratio of waist size to hip size increased, meaning
there was a greater increase in waist size.
   The survey tracked 1,122 men between the ages of 19 and 102
between 1960 and 1986. The researchers measured the subjects'
height, weight, waist size and hip size and tracked changes in
measurements and smoking status at two-year intervals.
   Smoking-related deaths claim 390,000 Americans annually,
according to the American Cancer Society, which says smoking is
linked to lung cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive lung
disease, emphysema, and various cancers.

<HEAD>Security Council Approves Namibia Peacekeeping Plan</HEAD>

   Malaysian and Yugoslav soldiers will be
among troops sent to Namibia to keep the peace this spring under a
U.N. plan that is to guide the territory to independence after 74
years of South African rule.
   The Security Council on Thursday approved a plan under which
troops and civilians from 23 countries will help transform Namibia
into a sovereign state.
   Today, the General Assembly votes on allocating $416 million for
the one-year operation.
   Under accords signed in November, South Africa promised to free
Namibia and Cuba promised to withdraw from neighboring Angola by
mid-1991 the 50,000 troops helping that country's Marxist government
fight U.S.-backed rebels.
   The U.N. team begins work April 1 and will monitor elections set
for November in which Namibians will choose a constituent assembly
that is to organize an independent, black majority-ruled government.
   The mission will send 4,650 military peacekeepers, 500 police
supervisors, more than 760 civilian U.N. staff, 820 locally hired
staff and 620 election monitors to the territory also known as
South-West Africa.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar may dispatch a total of
7,500 troops if necessary. The initial deployment was limited as a
cost-cutting measure at the insistence of the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain, France and China, which together pay 57 percent of
all peacekeeping costs.
   The Security Council approved three military peacekeeping
battalions consisting of troops from Bangladesh, Finland, Kenya,
Malaysia, Togo, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
   Military observers will be supplied by Bangladesh,
Czechoslovakia, Finland, India, Ireland, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Panama, Peru, Poland, Sudan, Togo and Yugoslavia.
   Logistic units will come from Canada, Australia, Britain,
Denmark, Italy, Poland and Spain. They will include civilians from
West Germany and Switzerland.
   Sweden had been expected to contribute troops, but South Africa
vetoed Swedish participation, fearing the Swedes would not be
impartial.
   South Africa objected to Sweden's longstanding support for the
South-West Africa People's Organization, the guerrilla force that
has been fighting for independence since 1966 and is expected to win
a majority in the constituent assembly.
   Election monitors will be drawn from numerous countries. China
has agreed to provide up to 20 monitors, the first time it has sent
personnel on a peacekeeping mission.
   South Africa is to pull all but 1,500 of its approximately 50,000
soldiers out of Namibia by the end of June and cut Namibia's police
force, whom U.N. police will supervise, from 8,300 to 6,000 men.
   U.N. peacekeepers will oversee the 1,500 South African troops who
will be confined to two Namibian bases, and will also monitor the
SWAPO guerrillas in their bases.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since it captured the colony from
Germany during World War I.

<HEAD>Activist Says FBI Improperly Investigated Him for 30 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil rights activist who was one of the
last Americans to serve prison time for contempt of Congress during
the McCarthy era has moved to overturn his conviction, based on an
uncovered FBI memo.
   A petition filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta Thursday asks
that Frank Wilkinson's contempt-of-Congress conviction be set aside.
Wilkinson's lawyers argue that the government deliberately concealed
evidence that a crucial witness who testified against Wilkinson was
considered unreliable.
   Wilkinson, now 74, first came to the attention of the FBI during
the 1940s when he led a move to integrate public housing in Los
Angeles. He and fellow integrationist Carl Braden were the last of
36 Americans sent to jail for clashing with the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
   A newly released FBI memo, which remained classified until last
year, shows the FBI knew in 1961 that Anita Edith Schneider, the
woman who accused Wilkinson of being a Communist, had ``exhibited
emotional instability'' at a 1955 hearing.
   Therefore, the 1961 memo said, information on Wilkinson's alleged
Communist Party membership ``comes from sources not considered
advisable to use as government witnesses.''
   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court used Ms. Schneider's testimony
that she knew Wilkinson as a fellow Communist party member in
rejecting an appeal by Wilkinson on a 5-4 vote.
   Wilkinson eventually served nine months of a one-year prison term
for refusing to answer the questions of the house committee.
   ``We have a government which had in its possession information
that clearly related to the reliability, the credibility, of the
only witness whose testimony was used to convict Frank Wilkinson of
contempt of Congress,'' said Wilkinson's attorney, Douglas E. Mirell
of Los Angeles.
   ``We believe that in fact a fraud was perpetrated by the
government upon the judicial system,'' Mirell said.
   Wilkinson's court petition invokes a procedure used when new
evidence comes to light following a conviction. It was filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Los Angeles law firm of Loeb
&amp; Loeb.
   He obtained the memo about Ms. Schneider as part of the
settlement of his 15-year-old lawsuit against the FBI, seeking
information the agency had gathered about him and his group, the
National Committee Against Repressive Legislation.
   ``The whole course of First Amendment law has been affected by
it,'' said Paul Hoffman, legal director of the ACLU Foundation of
Southern California. ``What we have here is the government, by its
affirmative misrepresentation, in fact distorting the whole course
of constitutional history.''

   The National Guard will join the fight against
the deadly and growing drug problem in the nation's capital.
   District of Columbia National Guard Maj. Gen. Calvin Franklin
said Thursday that the Pentagon has given preliminary approval to a
$300,000 project allowing guardsmen to aid city police in breaking
up more than 80 open-air drug markets that flourish in the district.
   ``It could involve the guard using helicopters and night vision
devices to assist in monitoring and detection of illegal drugs,''
said Franklin.
   The city's murder rate is the worst in the nation, with 84 people
killed so far this year, many in shootings police said were
drug-related. Police say 60 percent of last year's record 372
killings were drug-related.

   The National Institutes of Health will
immediately treat its workers who are accidentally exposed to the
AIDS virus with zidovudine, the only drug now approved for treatment
of the viral disease.
   In a notice posted late Thursday to NIH employees, an AIDS
advisory group announced that NIH director James B. Wyngaarden had
approved the emergency use of the drug, also known as AZT, for
research and clinical workers exposed to the AIDS virus in
laboratory or hospital settings.
   The AIDS virus is being studied at a number of laboratories at
the NIH, and there also are patients treated at the NIH clinics.
Elaborate laboratory procedures are in effect to contain and control
the virus, but there have been a number of health care workers
exposed through needle sticks or other accidents.
   At least one medical worker in the U.S. has developed AIDS after
such an accident.

   Elizabeth Taylor was hailed as one of
Hollywood's last true legends during an all-star tribute to her
philanthropic works.
   The actress, who turns 57 Monday, was the recipient of America's
Hope Award at the Bob Hope Cultural Center in Palm Desert, an
exclusive resort 120 miles east of Los Angeles. The show was taped
for an hourlong ABC-TV special to be broadcast on March 9.
   The award acknowledged her charity work, including the
establishment of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   ``I thought that she looked just tremendous, absolutely regal,
like a princess,'' said Mickey Rooney, Miss Taylor's co-star in the
1945 classic, ``National Velvet.'' ``Elizabeth Taylor is one of the
last in the genre known as a real star. There are few people today
who are stars.''
   Stevie Wonder, Carol Burnett, June Allyson, Kenny Rogers, Bob
Hope and former President Gerald Ford were among the other
celebrants in attendance. Miss Taylor was escorted by Malcolm
Forbes, the publisher.
   Miss Taylor waved, smiled and welled up in tears during the
program, which featured personal tributes and excerpts from her
films.
   The actress, who has raised $14 million for various charities,
called upon others to help society.
   ``As human beings we must strive to remember that we are all
human beings. We must give of ourselves a compassion, a commitment
and our love,'' she said.
   Miss Taylor's appearance after a monthlong seclusion put to rest
speculation that she has gained weight and undergone treatment for
drug or alcohol abuse.

   An American crowd at an American state funeral would
have been different. Americans would have come equipped with
binoculars. Americans would have made some noise. Americans would
have brought the children.
   Americans would have gotten acquainted with their neighbors and
chatted about the cold rain, saying they wished they had worn long
underwear.
   No American crowd would have been so capable of sitting so still
as long the Japanese did today at the funeral for their emperor. The
visiting American dignitary, President Bush, was surrounded by 9,800
Japanese, oblivious to him and demonstrating in every way the
differences between their two societies.
   In this nasty, wet cold, Americans would have clapped their hands
together to warm up, dabbed handkerchiefs to runny noses and stomped
their feet. The Japanese did none of that, sitting motionless in
silence for four hours or more, talking in whispers if they talked
at all.
   Americans would have huddled under the brown, furry blankets that
were provided for every Japanese guest at the funeral.
   The Japanese used the blankets as tidy lap robes. In their hands
some of them held little bags filled with a chemical. When the bags
are shaken, they emit a small amount of heat, enough to warm a hand.
One Japanese woman shook her bag and slipped it into her shoe.
   The crowd at the Imperial Garden assembled under two enormous
open-sided white tents. Most were too far away to see the
proceedings, but still able to watch seven giant television screens
that carried a fuzzy picture of what was going on before them.
   Here was Japan's elite: members of the parliament, of the
national and local governments, leaders of the giant corporations
that are household names around the world.
   Over and over, bows were exchanged. A person taking his seat
would first bow to those he recognized in his row. These were deep
bows, from the waist straight down, nothing held back, nothing
merely symbolic about them.
   Many acquaintances would bow upon seeing each other, shake hands,
bow again. Those who arrived early and took their seats rubbernecked
at the late arrivals. Latecomers offered bows and were bowed to in
return. Those already in their seats often bowed without rising.
   No public tears were shed here. The crowd was somber, stoic, not
grief-stricken.
   But nothing prepared an American visitor for the change in mood
around the corner. Some of the mourners slipped away to another wing
of the tent for a paper cupful of tea, served by young women in
black suits, for a smoke, for conversation, for a break.
   The air was dense with cigarette smoke, noisy with chatter. Men _
few women ventured in _ stood around tables which carried only one
thing: an ashtray. The visitors huddled around gas stoves to warm up
for a few minutes.
   The atmosphere was almost like that of a political convention,
but with the eternal bow substituting for backslaps.

   Rep. Donald Lukens denied any wrongdoing
after being indicted on a misdemeanor charge that he had sex with a
teen-age girl.
   Lukens, a Republican, was indicted Thursday by a Franklin County
grand jury on a charge of contributing to the unruliness and
delinquency of a child. The first-degree misdemeanor carries a
maximum jail term of 180 days and a $1,000 fine.
   The charge resulted from an investigation prompted by a secretly
videotaped meeting last November between Lukens and the girl's
mother, who contended Lukens paid for sexual relations with her
daughter on two occasions. One of those times allegedly was four
years ago when the girl was 13.
   The grand jury accused Lukens of having sexual intercourse with
the girl on Nov. 6, when she was 16, in his Columbus apartment.
   ``I do categorically deny that I contributed to the delinquency
and unruliness of a minor at any time, and I further categorically
deny the accuracy of the alleged facts upon which the charge was
apparently based,'' Lukens said from his Washington office. ``I am
innocent of the charge brought forth today.''
   Lukens, 58 and divorced, said his attorney had advised him
against commenting on the allegations beyond his brief statement.
   Lukens did not testify before the grand jury, which did not ask
him to appear, Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller said.
   No date for an initial court appearance was set for Lukens.
   The House Ethics Committee, which has jurisdiction over
allegations of wrongdoing by lawmakers, typically waits for the
outcome before taking any action in cases where members have been
charged in court.
   A criminal conviction does not automatically bar a legislator
from sitting in Congress.
   Columbus television station WSYX on Feb. 1 broadcast a videotape
that shows Lukens apparently offering a job to Anna Coffman after
she asked him why he was ``messing around'' with her daughter. The
station said it videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting between Lukens and
Ms. Coffman at a fast-food restaurant in Columbus.
   But the FBI and prosecutors reviewed the tape and said they found
no evidence of bribery.
   The grand jury heard testimony from the girl, Ms. Coffman and at
least two women who said they saw Lukens with the girl in his
apartment.
   Ms. Coffman, interviewed by WDTN-TV of Dayton following the
indictment, said she had hoped the grand jury would have returned a
more serious charge.
   ``I expected more because this is a very serious matter,'' Ms.
Coffman said. ``What kind of impression does it have on our
children, our future?''
   Mrs. Coffman's daughter said she thinks an appropriate penalty
would be to see Lukens go to jail and no longer be a congressman.
   ``It's like a hurt right underneath my heart,'' the daughter said.
   Lukens was first elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms. He lost a bid for governor in the 1970 Republican primary.
   After that race, he was barred from seeking public office for
five years for not filing campaign reports on time. That campaign
law was changed before the five-year period expired, and he was
appointed to the state Senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term. He
returned to Congress in 1986.

   A military jury spared a
U.S. navy captain serious punishment after convicting him today of
failing to help Vietnamese boat people who resorted to cannibalism
to survive.
   The jury of six Navy captains could have jailed Alexander Balian
for 90 days and made him forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three
months.
   Instead, they gave the decorated Vietnam War veteran a reprimand,
saying he erred last June 9 while his ship was in the South China
Sea but deserved no further punishment than to be relieved of
command, as he was in August.
   Balian, 48, claimed he had been made a scapegoat over the
incident and that ``heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get
in trouble.''
   The jury had acquitted him of the more serious charge of ordering
one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard the
amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque.
   The jury deliberated nearly six hours before returning a verdict.
It took a half hour to decide on the sentence.
   Balian, of Los Angeles, was accused of failing to render adequate
assistance to more than 80 Vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the
Dubuque encountered about 250 miles north of the Philippine island
of Palawan.
   U.N. officials said 31 of the refugees later died. Survivors said
they had devoured the dead to survive before Filipino fishermen
rescued them on June 27.
   The jury found Balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing
to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat; determine
whether its sail was adequate; conduct appropriate medical
examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees; provide necessary
navigational equipment; provide adequate water and clothing to the
naked, and take refugees aboard or see to it they were taken aboard
or assisted by a Navy supply ship in the area.
   The prosecution had claimed Balian abandoned the refugees in his
rush to resume his voyage to the Persian Gulf, where the Dubuque
took part in U.S. Navy security operations during the final days of
the Iran-Iraq war.
   The defense argued that he was under pressure from his commanders
to reach the Persian Gulf, where the Dubuque served as mother ship
for U.S. minesweepers and provided a backup force of 400 Marines.
   Balian testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did
not realize how desperate their situation was.
   He also said he believed the refugees' vessel seaworthy based on
reports from the ship's executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter.
   After the sentence, Balian told reporters he accepted
responsibility for his decision but called the Navy investigation
unfair.
   He said an initial probe had cleared him of wrongdoing but that
the second investigation was conducted by an officer of whom he had
been critical.
   Balian also said at least four members of his crew should be
court-martialed for their actions. He did not identify them.
   ``In hindsight, I should have done it different,'' Balian said.
He said the refugee problem was ``politically messy for the Navy
because no matter how you look at it, the Navy was embarrassed.''
   The captain also said there had been insufficient emphasis ``on
what really happened on that junk, why two young children were
allowed to die and why three were murdered and all five eaten. Where
is the accountability for that?''
   He said the jury was ``as fair as they could be, but the dirty
procedures to get me to court martial are sickening.''
   Balian took command of the Dubuque, a 16,500-ton vessel based in
Sasebo, Japan, in May 1987 and was relieved of command last August.
   He said he had received a new assignment as assistant chief of
plans at the Navy's telecommunications command in Washington but did
not know whether he would stay in the service.
   The captain denied prosecution allegations he did not care about
the fate of Vietnamese refugees.
   ``I fought for them,'' he said. ``We fought and were wounded
because we cared about the Vietnamese. God knows this didn't come
out well and I'm accountable, I'm responsible.''
   In 1966, Balian won the Silver Star, the third highest military
award for valor, and a Purple Heart for wounds because he saved
members of his crew after their river patrol boat was caught in a
Viet Cong night ambush.
   Balian later served a second tour in Vietnam aboard a destroyer.
His tours of duty since have included command of the ammunition
supply ships USS Kilauea and USS Kiska, and the amphibious assault
ship USS Peleliu.

<HEAD>Bison Hunt An Experience Of A Lifetime For Some; For Others, A Disgrace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters call it the experience of a
lifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the American
frontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunt
a slaughter and a disgrace.
   More than 15 percent of the Yellowstone National Park buffalo
herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond
the park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permits
the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle.
   A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state was
mailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they can
come to Paradise Valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross
into Montana.
   ``If any animal, even a bloodthirsty Montana hunter, could be a
part of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I can't
believe it,'' said Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund for
Animals in New York. ``This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.''
   East Coast animal-rights activists are not the only people
critical of the hunt.
   Ellery Merrell, a 73-year-old rancher who has lived his entire
life in Tom Miner Basin about 18 miles north of Yellowstone, said it
was sickening to watch the buffalo fall.
   ``They're about as smart as a damned old milk cow,'' Merrell said
of the bison.
   Merrell said he had nine buffalo on his property Wednesday
morning. He allows no buffalo hunting, but the animals are killed
when they cross the road to other property, he said.
   Its legendary lack of intelligence notwithstanding, the buffalo
fascinates hunters and wildlife lovers equally. The stubborn, shaggy
giants represent the frontier lost 100 years ago.
   Many of the hunters, most of them Montanans who have hunted all
their lives, call the bison hunt an experience they will never
forget.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., said he had looked forward to
killing a bison with his .44-magnum pistol, but was unable to get
away for the hunt.
   ``I think that both the National Park Service and the state are
acting in a responsible manner,'' Marlenee said. ``There are too
many buffalo in the park. The harvest of those buffalo is a humane
harvest of animals that would otherwise starve to death.''
   For the state of Montana, however, it's an economic issue.
   About half of Yellowstone's bison carry brucellosis, a disease
which some scientists say could be transmitted to Montana cattle
herds. Brucellosis causes cows to spontaneously abort their calves.
   Herds could be quarantined if the disease should start to spread.
   The Legislature cited that concern when it decided in 1985 to
allow hunters to kill bison entering Montana. The previous winter,
state wildlife officials shot 88 bison in Montana to control
brucellosis.
   But Louisa Willcox of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition dismissed
disease as a justification for the hunt, saying cattle in the area
are vaccinated against it.
   ``Theoretically, it's certainly possible,'' she said of the
disease risk. ``Realistically, it's not.''
   Once numbering in the millions, the buffalo faced extinction by
late in the 19th century. Yellowstone's buffalo herd has rebounded
from fewer than 50 at the turn of the century to about 2,700 last
winter.
   Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said that even if all 750 hunters
on the state's list were to kill a bison, the survival of the
Yellowstone herds and the species is not at all threatened by the
biggest hunting death toll of the century.
   Anzelmo also said there won't be another year like this one soon.
Large numbers of buffalo are being killed this year because recent
mild winters allowed the survival of many animals that normally
would have died.
   Last year only 39 bison were shot.
   Montana originally chose 250 names of hunters from those who
applied for $200 bison tags at the beginning of the current season
Oct 1. Another 250 were called in January, said Nancy Craft of the
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department.

   A female doctor and a
14-year-old girl may have been raped before they were killed in an
army massacre at a rebel field hospital, a human rights group says.
   Ten people, included wounded rebels, were slain in the Feb. 13
attack on the hospital by an elite army battalion, the Roman
Catholic Church's Legal Aid office said Thursday.
   The office, a highly respected human rights organization in El
Salvador, said the doctor's body bore 10 bullet wounds and the
teen-ager's body six. It said both were severely bruised on the
inner thighs and breasts.
   Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, reported
on Feb. 15 that troops of the Atlacatl Battalion attacked and
destroyed the field hospital two days earlier.
   It said six people, three medical workers and three wounded
guerrillas, were killed.
   Both the Legal Aid office and the rebel radio identified the
female victims as Alejandra Bravo Betancourt, a 35-year-old Mexican
physician; and Rosibel Dubon, 14, a paramedic's aide. Their bodies
were exhumed and examined Feb. 17 by the Legal Aid office.
   The alleged massacre took place outside the village of Los
Encuentros near the Sumpul River that forms El Salvador's northern
border with Honduras.
   The northern province of Chalatenango, where Los Encuentros is
located, is a stronghold of leftist rebels waging a 9-year civil war
against the U.S.-backed government.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, military commander of Chalatenango, told
reporters Thursday there was no field hospital near Los Encuentros.
But he said Atlacatl troopers killed several guerrillas, including
the Mexican doctor, in combat Feb. 13.
   ``They were treating one wounded subversive,'' said Lopez Roque.
``But it was not a field hospital. There wasn't even a hut there.''
   Legal Aid concluded a field hospital was in fact installed near
Los Encuentros, and that Atlacatl troops ``attacked and destroyed
the field hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel
present.''
   Legal Aid said in addition to the doctor and girl, five wounded
guerrillas and three other medical aides were killed in the Atlacatl
attack.
   ``Because the bodies of the two women were completely nude and
both were bruised around the breasts and on the inside of the
thighs, rape or attempted rape is presumed,'' the report said.
   The church office called the attack ``a flagrant violation'' of
the Salvadoran Constitution and of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
   The alleged massacre took place 10 days after a visit to El
Salvador by Vice President Dan Quayle. Quayle delivered what he
called a very emphatic message to the effect that Washington
expected the Salvadoran armed forces to improve their human rights
record.

   In its report Thursday, the newspaper said the accident happened
recently but gave no date.
   The team of six had been hauling equipment to an intermediary

   Sikh gunmen crept into a Sikh farming
family's sleeping quarters near Amritsar and killed a father and his
four sons, a senior police official said today.
   Police blamed the same group of six separatists for a second
attack Thursday night in a nearby village in which another Sikh was
killed.
   More than 300 people have been killed so far this year by Sikh
extremists, who have for seven years waged a bloody guerrilla war
against the predominantly Hindu government for a separate homeland.
   The gunmen forced their way into the house of Amrik Singh, 65,
and opened fire on the male members with Chinese assault rifles,
Police Superintendent G.S. Mann said.
   Singh's wife and the wives of two of his sons were herded into
the next room during the shooting, Mann said. He said the attack
occurred in Rampur Thera village, about 25 miles north of Amritsar.
   Police said the six militants also killed Hajara Singh in Dhup
Sari village about 3 miles from Rampur Thera.
   Moderate Sikhs opposed to the violent campaign for a separate
state have been frequent targets of Sikh militants, who also kill
Hindus.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population but are a slight
majority in Punjab. Militants among them claim they are
discriminated against by Hindus, who comprise more than 82 percent
of India's 880 million people.

<HEAD>Patrol Says Asylum-Seekers Hiding Across the Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tents were empty, the applications lay
blank and all was quiet on the Texas border today, but immigration
authorities warned that thousands of Central Americans were ``lying
low'' and hoping for a lapse in tighter federal restrictions.
   ``I don't think they will stop coming,'' said Juan Bautista
Sanchez-Sanchez, a Nicaraguan who was detained after his application
for asylum was denied. He said he left home after being arrested and
beaten for marching against Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but for
political reasons and I think they will come if I tell them that
even if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' he
said.
   But for now, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's tough
new asylum policy has achieved its goal: a sharply reduced flow of
Central Americans across the Texas border. Patrol officers all along
the border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase in
illegal immigration, despite rumors that immigrants were shifting
their point of entry westward to Laredo and El Paso.
   ``We're keeping an eye on the situation,'' said Jaime Arras of
the U.S. Border Patrol Office in El Paso.
   Border Patrol officers in Laredo also said they had seen no
unusual activity.
   But many Central Americans are presumed to be in Mexico, waiting
their turn to make it past Border Patrol checkpoints and to their
destinations in the interior.
   ``They are not stupid. They're lying low,'' said Silvestre Reyes,
Border Patrol chief for the McAllen sector. ``They're probably with
a sympathizer, on their own or with an alien smuggler in hs through the
Rio Grande Valley around
Brownsville, including 40,000 who have sought political asylum.
   To control that flow, an army of INS workers and additional
border patrol officers descended on the Texas border this week to
carry out the tougher rules for asylum-seekers.
   At the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, where an influx of
asylum applicants was expected, giant tents were pitched to house
detainees and dozens of typewriters were shipped to process
applications. So far, none of the tents and few of the typewriters
have been needed.
   INS officers processed 233 applications for asylum on Tuesday,
the first day of the new policy, but just 51 on Wednesday and 10 on
Thursday. Only two of the more than 300 applicants were granted
asylum.
   ``Nobody is coming to apply for asylum and that's sort of
predictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jail
here, so obviously people are going underground and they are not
going to be going through the system anymore, which is a tragedy,''
said Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based Proyecto
Libertad, which represents Central Americans.
   Under the old INS procedures, immigrants applying for asylum had
to wait weeks while their applications were processed, during which
they were released on their own recognizance.
   Under the new policy, applications are processed on the spot but
those whose applications are denied are being held on bonds between
$1,000 and $4,000. They are housed at an indoor detention center at
Port Isabel, 15 miles northeast of Brownsville, or at a Red Cross
shelter near the Texas-Mexico border.
   Thursday night, more than 400 people stayed at the shelter, only
130 of whom were sent by the INS. The others showed up on their own
to await processing of their applications, according to Jim Buck,
deputy commissioner of the INS.
   Buck said immigration agents are posted at the shelter but not in
an adversarial role.
   ``We want these people to have a place to stay. We don't want
them out in the streets,'' he said. ``We will have daily roll call,
but we won't have any ... heavy armaments and they'll have free
movement.''

<HEAD>Hospitals Form Day-Care Programs For Ailing Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When little Jessica has a cold, her working parents
can depend on increasing numbers of hospital day-care programs with
such names as ``Sniffles and Sneezes'' and ``Under the Weather.''
   Springing up nationwide in the past five years, day care for
mildly ill children in hospitals and independent infirmaries is
catching on. In Massachusetts, about a dozen hospitals offer the
service, according to the state Office for Children.
   The trend prompted the state agency to study the need for such
health care and to come up with alternatives that suit both anxious
workers and employers concerned about lost productivity when staff
members stay home.
   The day-care infirmaries generally take youngsters recuperating
from the run-of-the-mill childhood illnesses.
   Dr. George Sterne, a pediatrician in New Orleans who is on a
national panel working on standards for such care, said mixing
hospitals with day care came about because hospitals had vacant beds
and needed to keep nurses on the job when their own children were
ill.
   Maureen McAndrew, the nurse manager of pediatrics at St. John's
Medical Center in Lowell, runs the hospital's 2-year-old ``Sniffles
and Sneezes'' program.
   A room at the end of the pediatric floor accommodates up to five
children with beds and a play area that includes board games and a
television set. The program accepts children from six weeks to about
12 years of age. While the number of days is unlimited, they can
remain in care for no more than 10 hours a day. The cost is $2.50 an
hour, lunch included.
   Parents are required to stay with their children about 15 minutes
before depositing them in an effort to ease the transition.
   ``It's run by a hospital, in a hospital but they're not treated
like they're in the hospital,'' said Mrs. McAndrew, who added the
program averages two to three children at a time.
   Marcia Mandell-Zimmer is a nursing supervisor at St. John's. Last
year, when she worked elsewhere and didn't know about Sniffles and
Sneezes, Ms. Mandell-Zimmer said she missed three days of work for
her own illness but more than four weeks caring for her baby son,
Jonathan, when he was too sick to go to day care.
   In January, Jonathan was recovering from a fever and flu symptoms
when she took him to the unit at work for one day and was relieved
of the worries working parents usually face with a sick child.
   ``You feel guilty trying to send your child to day care knowing
they really shouldn't be there,'' she said. ``But if you don't have
any vacation time saved up, you miss a day's pay. And it doesn't
look good on your record.''
   With the hospital day care, she said, she had no such concerns.
   ``It's what money cannot buy, and it's cheaper per hour than a
babysitter,'' she said.
   A report in Pediatrician Magazine calculated that businesses lose
six to 29 days annually per parent of children under age 6 who are
out sick, at a cost ranging between $2 billion and $12 billion,
according to Judith Presser, chairperson of the Health and Childcare
task force of the Office for Children.
   Sterne said he strongly opposes the notion of a hospital unit for
day care unless it is segregated from the hospital setting and uses
staff whose primary training is in early childhood education.
   ``This is the kind of issue that gets parents very emotionally
involved,'' Ms. Presser said in an interview Thursday. ``It's new.
Parents are uncertain of it.''
   Like Massachusetts, the states of California, Delaware, New
Jersey and Minnesota already have or are completing regulations on
such health care for children, she said.
   ``You're going to see another half dozen states in the next two
years developing this kind of regulation,'' Ms. Presser said. In the
meantime, she said, ``There are no state implemented standards, so
parents have to look at whether they're good for their child.''

   City councilors who asked the city's
Law Department how to go about driving snakes from this heavily
Irish city got an answer harking back to the old sod.
   ``We have thought of suggesting you hire a consultant but the
only person we are aware of who successfully drove snakes out of an
area apparently retired a long time ago,'' city lawyers said in a
recent unsigned memo, referring to the legend of St. Patrick driving
the snakes from Ireland.
   The councilors made the request a few weeks ago because of
complaints about a pet python on the loose in a residential
neighborhood. The nine-foot python disappeared three months ago and
hasn't been seen since.
   The city lawyers' went on to suggest in their memo that the
councilors visit the St. Patrick's Day Parade in neighboring
Holyoke. The march, which annually attracts more than 225,000
people, ``is regarded as being most conducive to the thoughtful
discussion and consideration of driving snakes from places,'' they
said.
   The last known fatality from a snake bite in Massachusetts
occurred outside Springfield in 1761 when Timothy Mireck was struck
by a rattlesnake. The song ``On Springfield Mountain,'' considered
one of America's first folk tunes, commemorates Mireck's encounter
with the ``pesky sarpent.''

   A coffee dispute is brewing at City Hall.
   George Jacoby, an aide to Mayor Sophie Masloff, says he's
steaming over a decision by City Controller Tom Flaherty to
challenge a $177.60 bill submitted for coffee supplied to the
mayor's office.
   ``The vast majority of the coffee consumed in the mayor's suite
is by visitors. We have very little hospitality to offer other than
a cup of coffee,'' he said.
   Gil Martinez, a contracts supervisor for Flaherty, recently wrote
a memo to the mayor challenging the bill and claiming the mayor
failed to follow proper procedures for procuring the percolating
perk. He said a contract must be awarded for a coffee service.
   ``The more important question is how can you justify using tax
dollars to purchase coffee for your office?'' Martinez said.
   Flaherty and Masloff are among several Democrats running for
mayor.

an eyesore.
   A water-supply pipe has already been installed, at a cost of
$40,000, for the north tower toilet on the drawbridge.
   But work on the sewer pipe has been stopped for the present in
response to complaints from neighbors and the city Engineering
Department's own surprise at how ugly the 4-inch cast-iron sewer
line looks hanging from rods under the bridge, said Jim Bodoia,
project engineer.
   Critics have suggested a pump system, which would allow the
plumbing to be hidden under the bridge deck. Bodoia said that would
be more expensive, as would a holding tank arrangement that was
considered by the city.
   However, Bodoia said that with the complaints, a decision still
has to be made on whether to go ahead with the unsightly
installation or an alternative.
   Why not just have the bridge tender walk to the south tower
toilet when nature calls?
   That would require a walk of about a block each way, and the
Engineering Department's Ed Engel said the Coast Guard frowns on the
operator leaving the tower, in case boat traffic approaches.

   What do you feed a hungry cosmonaut?
   The Soviet news agency Tass suggests the fare aboard the Mir
space station is so out-of-this-world that it would bring water to
the mouths of earthbound gourmets.
   ``Some dishes are so exquisite that lovers of gourmet food on
Earth would be glad to have them,'' the news agency said Thursday.
``These include chicken paste with plums, sturgeon with jellied
sauce, processed fruit and all kinds of juices.''
   For the anniversary of the Soviet army and navy Thursday,
cosmonauts Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov
dined on pickled cucumbers, lemons, fresh fruit and Russian bee
honey, Tass said.
   Tass said such delicacies are part of a space diet that includes
about 70 dishes, including meat, fish and dairy products. Some
Soviet spacemen spend months in orbit.
   Alas, cosmonauts must forgo the bubbly, according to Tass:
``Cosmonauts are not allowed to have alcholic drinks even on the
most solemn occasions.''

<HEAD>Marcos Marks Third Anniversary of Exile in Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the Philippine and U.S. governments
consider the fate of Ferdinand E. Marcos, doctors say his exile here
may soon end without a struggle _ in death.
   Sunday is the third anniversary of the deposed Philippine
president's arrival in exile, and he will probably mark the occasion
from his hospital bed, where he has spent most of 1989. Doctors say
he appears tired and defeated.
   ``It's very hard to describe why a patient is so lethargic, why
they don't move around in bed or try to stand,'' said Dr. George
Druger, a lung specialist who has treated the 71-year-old Marcos for
the past six weeks at St. Francis Medical Center.
   ``It's almost as though he's lost his will to live. He's trying,
but he's not fighting like he used to,'' Druger said.
   Druger, one of a team of doctors treating the former president,
said Marcos has only a 50 percent chance of ever leaving the
hospital and a 10 percent chance of living another year.
   Marcos' ill health has prevented him from being arraigned in New
York on federal racketeering charges. He and his wife, Imelda, are
accused of stealing more than $100 million from their homeland and
stashing it in the United States.
   After their indictment Oct. 21, Mrs. Marcos flew to New York to
plead innocent and was freed on $5 million bail.
   Although the Philippine government claims Marcos stole billions
of dollars during his 20-year rule, it has never charged him with
fraud.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan is scheduled to resume a
hearing March 6 on whether Marcos is well enough to be arraigned in
New York. His attorneys argue Marcos should be granted a ``medical
severance,'' meaning prosecution against him would not proceed
unless he recovers. Prosecutors have said it is too early to
determine Marcos' long-term prognosis.
   Aides said Marcos' spirits were buoyed Thursday by a visit from
Cardinal Ricardo J. Vidal, the archbishop of the central Philippine
city of Cebu, who performed Mass at Marcos' bedside and gave
Communion to Marcos and his wife.
   ``This is a pastoral and spiritual visit to a very sick man,''
Vidal said. ``It is the only reason I came to Hawaii. I'm not acting
as an emissary.''
   Marcos remains in guarded condition in the hospital's intensive
care unit. Druger said Marcos improved slightly in the past week,
relying on a respirator only while sleeping and speaking clearly for
the first time in three weeks.
   Marcos, who arrived in Hawaii on Feb. 26, 1986, after being
ousted in a popular uprising, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15
for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
   Earlier, he was hospitalized with congestive heart failure; he
also suffers from kidney problems.
   A few weeks ago Marcos aides said it was the leader's dying wish
that he be allowed to return to his homeland. Philippine President
Corazon Aquino has banned his return, saying it would threaten
national security.
   Mrs. Marcos has visited her husband daily during his hospital
stay while maintaining her whirlwind social life. The 59-year-old
former beauty queen is often sighted at Honolulu's most expensive
restaurants and popular nightclubs.
   While her husband lies in the hospital, Mrs. Marcos' outings are
tracked by FBI agents and reported in local gossip columns.
   ``Sometimes she sees the FBI guys sitting at the other end of the
restaurant and she invites them over,'' said Gemmo Trinidad, a
family spokesman. ``Some things (in the news media) hurt her
feelings, but the general public is nice to her, people even ask for
her autograph. She says their friendliness helps restore her faith
in America. And she still has hope that she and the president will
be cleared.''

<HEAD>Rockwell Paintings Returned Steel Company after Court Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST MIDDLESEX, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen Norman Rockwell paintings,
tucked away in a Florida corporate office for 20 years, were
returned to the steel company that commissioned them thanks to an
out-of-court settlement with its estranged chairman.
   The 23-by-30-inch paintings, commissioned by Sharon Steel Corp.
and produced by the renowned artist in 1966, were recently returned
to the steelmaker by the company's now powerless chairman, Victor
Posner.
   Sharon Steel executives and guests, including three retired
steelworkers who modeled for Rockwell, paid $50 a ticket for charity
Thursday night at a black-tie viewing of the oil paintings, which
depict workers involved in various steelmaking operations.
   ``It looks better each time I look at it,'' said George
Petropulos, a 29-year veteran of Sharon Steel who posed for one of
the paintings.
   He said another steelworker was originally chosen to be a subject
for the painting.
   ``But Mrs. Rockwell saw me at the company and thought I was more
mature for the picture than the other person,'' Petropulos recalled.
   After taking control of the steelmaker in 1969, Posner ordered
the paintings moved to his corporate offices in Miami Beach, Fla.
   Sharon Steel, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, had to file suit against Posner last July after he first
refused to return the paintings. Posner agreed to relinquish the
paintings in an out-of-court settlement.
   ``You never know, we may be forced to sell them in the future by
events beyond our control,'' said Franklin ``Bill'' Agnew, who was
recently appointed by bankruptcy court to oversee the company's
reorganization. ``But I hope they stay in the community for a long
time to come.''
   Roger Reed, owner of Illustration House Inc. of New York, said he
had viewed copies of the paintings in a Rockwell catalogue and
believed each was worth $20,000.
   A mystery of sorts surrounds one painting. The company
commissioned 14 paintings, but only 13 were shipped to Posner's
offices 20 years ago. The one painting has never been found.
   That irks John Reichert, who posed for the missing painting.
   ``How can somebody walk in an office and take it away without
anyone knowing,'' Reichert said. ``Somebody knows where it is.''
   Company executives said they are at a loss as to where the
painting may be.
   ``The painting could have been given to one of our customers. But
who knows,'' said Walter Sieckman, chief operating officer for
Sharon Steel.
   He noted that when the paintings were first completed they
weren't considered exceptionally valuable.
   ``It was considered part of our advertising program at the
time,'' Sieckman said.
   Rockwell worked with his third wife, Molly, over a four-day
period in photographing the men who were subjects in the 14
paintings. He later put the images to canvas at his studio in
Stockbridge, Mass.
   ``He made you so at ease so quickly,'' recalls Robert Addicott, a
43-year veteran of Sharon Steel. ``He was a quiet man but he had a
sense of humor.''

   At the F.W. Woolworth Co. store downtown, an M-1
semi-automatic carbine is for sale for $199.99 as the ``gun of the
month,'' and that does not sit well with City Councilor David
Scondras.
   ``It's obscene to have a store that represents what is wholesome
in America ... to sell these weapons,'' Scondras said. ``They
shouldn't sell guns.''
   He wants such weapons as the M-1, which was used during World War
II, banned.
   A gun rack in the upstairs sporting goods department of the
downtown Woolworth's includes a gun rack stocked with rifles, among
which is a semi-automatic equipped with a steel bayonet.
   ``Guns with bayonets don't appeal to sportsmanship. They appeal
to Rambo,'' said Scondras. ``Why do hunters need a bayonet, to
skewer a squirrel? Give me a break.''
   The manager of the store referred questions to Woolworth's
headquarters in New York; a secretary there said no one from the
company would comment.
   Scondras said he would write to Woolworth's asking the chain to
stop selling guns.
   ``It sends a very bad message out to kids. Every kid in the world
knows about going to Woolworth's for toys and candy,'' he said. ``I
don't think their parents want them thinking about going there for
guns.''

<HEAD>South Shivers With Blast Of Snow And Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A blast of arctic air whisked through parts of the South,
threatening crops, closing schools and creating treacherous travel
conditions on roadways where scores of accidents occurred. Two
weather-related deaths were reported.
   Snow fell in some areas where people hadn't seen it for years, as
the gelid conditions descended as far south as Florida today. A
34-degree reading at Orlando was lower than the reading at Minot,
N.D., which had a temperature of 37 degrees.
   Elsewhere in the South, flood-stricken Kentucky was declared a
major disaster area by President Bush today, making federal aid
available to affected people and local governments. The region was
hit by heavy rains and flooding beginning on Feb. 13.
   And in Tennessee, many residents forced from their houses by the
rain-swollen Obion River contended with freezing temperatures and
icy backwater as they await a chance to start cleaning up the mess
left by the flooding.
   ``If it gets much colder, I'll be able to pick the backwater up
in my truck and haul it away,'' said Billy Elam, a resident of the
small town of Obion.
   Brisk northwest winds accompanied the cold temperatures,
producing wind chill readings in the single digits in Georgia this
morning.
   A man who would have celebrated his 85th birthday today was found
dead of hypothermia in Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday, police
spokesman Wyatt Gantt said. Because the heaters in the man's house
were off, his death was ruled weather-related, Gantt said.
   In Georgia, a 72-year-old man died Thursday when his pickup truck
fell off an icy bridge on the U.S. 29 bypass near Athens and plunged
into the North Oconee River, police said.
   Georgia's agriculture commissioner, Tommy Irvin, said freezing
weather threatened wheat, peach and onion crops.
   ``I think we're in for some hard times,'' said Rick Hartley,
Toombs County extension service director.
   In Alabama, peach growers also braced for the worst.
   ``Probably the majority of them right now feel like with as low
as it's predicted to go, there's not a whole lot they can do,'' said
Tommy Brown, extension agent coordinator for Chilton County, where
most of Alabama's peach crop is grown.
   Brown said some peach growers were planning to burn coal or tires
to ward off the effects of the bitter cold.
   An 88-year-old record was set in Mobile early today when the
temperature dropped to 24. The previous record for this date was 28
degrees set in 1901.
   In Georgia, snow accumulations ranged up to 7 inches, and
flurries were seen as far south as Valdosta, near the Florida border.
   Nancy Robinson, a police desk clerk in Valdosta, said the last
snowfall police could recall in the area was six years ago.
   ``The kids were very excited because they're not used to this,''
she said.
   The University of Georgia at Athens was closed today as were
school systems through the northern half of the state.
   Snow began falling in Savannah late Thursday, the first seen in
three years, police said. It forced closing of the Talmadge Memorial
Bridge over the Savannah River to South Carolina and caused a number
of accidents.
   Alabama emergency management officials said several major
roadways were closed Thursday because of slick conditions, including
sections of Interstate 59 in northeast Alabama and Interstate 20
east of Birmingham. All roads had reopened by the afternoon.
   The combination of increasing snowfall and high winds made
driving very hazardous throughout North Carolina.
   ``It's bad,'' said Officer Dennis Anders of the Alleghany County
Sheriff's Department. ``All the roads are covered, we've got ice,
and people are wrecking right and left.''
   A pair of firefighters and their two children were seriously
injured Thursday evening while trying to help two other motorists
trapped in an overturned car off Interstate 240.
   A tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck two parked pickups
carrying a boy and girl, and the two firefighters who were standing
along the road.
   Among the other accidents were a 15-car pileup in Asheville on
Thursday morning. And in Winston-Salem, at least 100 accidents were
reported within the city limits, authorities said.

<HEAD>Hundreds Rounded Up In U.S.-Mexico Border Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Mexican authorities riding
horses, all-terrain vehicles and helicopters rounded up about 500
suspected illegal aliens and drug traffickers in raids on both sides
of the border, news reports said.
   About 50 U.S. agents swept down to the north bank of the Tijuana
River's concrete-lined channel, the San Diego Union quoted U.S.
officials as saying, and took about 350 suspected undocumented
aliens into custody.
   Meanwhile, officers from city, state and federal police
departments in Tijuana waited south of the border as hundreds of
people fled up the south bank and through holes in the chainlink
border fence, the paper said Thursday.
   Mexican police arrested about 150 suspected alien smugglers and
drug dealers, the paper quoted Capt. Fernando Jimenez of the Tijuana
Police Department as saying.
   Authorities carried out the raids near the San Ysidro crossing
about six miles west of the proposed site of a border ditch that
U.S. officials say would help stop illegal border crossings. The
plan has fueled controversy in the United States, offended many
Mexicans, and aggravated border relations.
   News reports described Thursday's raids as one of the largest
such operations in recent years. The Mexico-City based Excelcior
news service said the raid lasted 45 minutes.
   ``There is a lot of bandit activity and drug dealing down on the
levee itself,'' the paper quoted U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Mike
Gregg as saying.``Once in a while, we gather our strength and run a
sweep.''
   A temporary shortage of U.S. Border Patrol agents has led
increasing numbers of migrants to cross at the river channel,
according to Border Patrol officials.
   U.S. authorities found no drugs or weapons, said Frank Wernsing,
agent in charge of the Imperial Beach Border Patrol station.
   ``We suspect when they realized they were going to be caught,
they threw whatever they had on the ground,'' he was quoted by the
paper as saying.
   Gregg said Thursday that most of the 350 suspects would be
processed as undocumented aliens and released in Tijuana overnight.
   Jimenez said many of the 150 suspects arrested in Tijuana were
held by the Federal Judicial Police for questioning on drug charges,
the newspaper said.

   Authorities found in an abandoned
house 85 tons of explosives that subversives intended to use for
more terrorist bombings, a military commander said.
   Four bombs have gone off in Honduras in less than a week.
   The explosives were found by police and soldiers Thursday in La
Ceiba, where the latest bombing occurred, in an abandoned house near
Hector Caraccioli Air Base, said Col. Erick Sanchez, chief of the
4th Infantry Batallion.
   ``These materials were to be used by subversive groups to
continue the chain of terrorist acts that lately have unleashed
panic in Honduras,'' he said.
   The cache included dynamite, detonators, liquid explosives, and
other explosives used in the construction industry, said Sanchez.
   No suspects were detained.
   Before dawn on Thursday, the offices of the Standard Fruit Co., a
subsidiary of the New York-based Castle &amp; Cook, were attacked in La
Ceiba, which is about 250 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
   On Tuesday, a bomb ripped through City Hall in Tegucigalpa,
injuring 10 people. Another bomb exploded Monday in a building
housing offices of the Interior Ministry in the capital. No injuries
were reported.
   On Saturday, a crude bomb thrown at the back of a bus carrying
U.S. soldiers north of Tegucigalpa injured three soldiers and two
Honduran civilians.
   No one has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks.
   Honduran leftists have protested the presence of U.S. soldiers
conducting maneuvers with the Honduran military.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Pioneer Meredith Says He Agrees With David Duke On Many
Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights pioneer James H. Meredith is
unfazed by the election of a former Ku Klux Klan leader to the
Louisiana Legislature and said he even agrees with him on numerous
issues.
   ``There's nothing wrong with his English,'' Meredith said of
David Duke. ``I understand what he's saying and a lot of it is the
same thing I've been saying.''
   Meredith, 55, a self-described conservative who was in New
Orleans Thursday to speak about a federal order to desegregate
Louisiana's colleges, said he found Duke more believable than many
other politicians.
   ``People say `he used to be a Klan leader' and he used to be this
or that, well, I'm a Christian and I believe people can change,''
Meredith said.
   Meredith, who had to be escorted into the University of
Mississippi by U.S. marshals in 1962 and who still bears the scars
of three shotgun blasts from an assassination attempt in 1966, said
before his speech that he and Duke agree on many things.
   ``We agree on equal opportunity. I am also against ...
affirmative action programs,'' he said. ``But it really shouldn't
get to that. Under our Constitution the people of a district elect
the person they want to represent them. And a if majority of those
people select a candidate, no one has a right to question it.''
   In Baton Rouge meantime, Duke said he was pleased with his
assignments on the state House of Representatives' Judiciary
Committee and Health and Welfare panel.
   ``That's what I wanted,'' Duke said. ``I want health and welfare
because obviously welfare reform is one of the most important parts
of my program. Judiciary, I'm concerned about our courts and law
enforcement.''
   Meredith, who like Duke is a Republican, echoed the former Klan
grand wizard in other areas.
   ``I'm against abortion. I'm against handing out diplomas to black
Americans who have not been taught what those diplomas represent,''
he said. ``I don't believe in paying welfare to able-bodied men and
women.
   ``I think those things are wrong and bad for us as a people. They
are the way the liberal establishment keeps power over people.''

<HEAD>Snow Along East Coast; Cold Sweeps Through South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Carolinas were digging out from a storm today that dumped up
to 7 inches of snow in some areas, and the outlook for much of the
East Coast was for more of the same.
   A low pressure area off the North Carolina coast continued
producing snow from eastern Georgia across the Carolinas and along
the Atlantic Coast. The storm center was to move northeast and
produce wintry weather in New England late tonight.
   Snowfall was heaviest in North Carolina, where 7 inches fell in
Lincoln County. Charlotte reported 5 inches. Driving conditions were
hazardous and numerous accidents were reported due to freezing snow
and ice on roads.
   Snowfall in South Carolina Thursday night included 5 inches at
Greenwood, and 3 to 5 inches in Rock Hill.
   Heavy snow also fell in Georgia, but was diminishing as the storm
system moved north.
   The snow was to spread up the Atlantic Coast to much of New
England today.
   An arctic air mass plunged as far south as Florida this morning,
and the 34-degree temperature at Orlando was lower than the 37
degrees Minot, N.D., posted.
   Wind chill readings in Georgia were in the single digits early
today.
   The nation's high temperature Thursday was 92 degrees at Santee,
Calif.
   Today's forecast called for snow in North Carolina, the Middle
Atlantic States and New England; snow squalls in northwest New York
and northeast Minnesota; and rain showers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures were to reach the teens and the 20s in inland New
England, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes; and the 30s and 40s in
coastal New England, the Middle Atlantic States, Florida, the Gulf
Coast, the Tennessee Valley, the Mississippi Valley, parts of the
Plains, northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.
   The mercury was to approach 70 degrees over the southern tip of
Texas and climb into the 80s in southern New Mexico, Arizona and
parts of California. High temperatures in Florida were to be in the
low 50s, with 60s in the remainder of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8

   A twin-engine plane crashed at the end
of a runway while trying to land, killing seven of the eight Finns
on board, aviation officials said today.
   The lone survivor of the crash at Helsinki's international
airport suffered minor injuries and walked 400 yards from the crash
site before rescue teams reached her, officials said.
   The Fairchild Metro aircraft went down around midnight Thursday
in light fog, they said. The plane was returning to Finland from
Southend, England.
   No cause of the crash was immediately given. The government today
appointed a special committee to investigate.

   The Soviet Union is posing the $25,000
Question, offering a prize in that amount to anyone who can figure
out the best way to convert the ruble into dollars, the top Soviet
economist says.
   A warning, though, to would-be entrants: Some Western economists
think the question may be unanswerable.
   Abel Aganbegyan, chief economic adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, mentioned the $25,000 prize Thursday in a speech to a
group of international bankers and businessmen.
   Aganbegyan said the Soviets are planning the contest jointly with
California's Esalen Institute, once better known for its encounter
sessions and other experiments in radical psychology.
   The Soviets have increasingly discussed the possibility of making
the ruble ``convertible'' so that it can be traded on world markets.
Because their currency cannot be traded for Western currency, it has
no intrinsic value on other markets. That severely limits the
Soviets' ability to buy foreign goods.
   In his San Francisco speech, Aganbegyan spoke of the
possibilities of converting the ruble to hard currency over the next
seven to 10 years or the creation of free trade zones in the country
with a second currency that would be semiconvertible.
   ``This semiconvertible currency would be backed by gold and
export goods,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union is aware that the official rate of the ruble is
``not realistic'' at $1.60, he said, adding that it might eventually
be devalued to half that amount. Black market rates for rubles in
the Soviet Union are 25 cents to 30 cents.
   In the meantime, he said, ``we plan to double internal prices for
raw materials and fuels ... to bring them closer to world prices.''
   Some Western economists scoff at the notion of the Soviets making
the ruble convertible, saying such a move would require a wholesale
transformation of the nation's economy.
   Asked about the idea last December, Val Zabijaka, an economist on
the Soviet desk at the U.S. Commerce Department, said, ``You
probably believe in Santa Claus, too.''
   In another speech in Silicon Valley, Aganbegyan told 200
executives of high-tech companies that the Soviet Union wants to
encourage joint ventures with U.S. firms to commercialize Soviet
technology.
   The Soviet Union recently abolished requirements that joint
ventures with companies from other countries had to be at least 51
percent Soviet-controlled.
   Jack Wilson, vice president of Dataquest Inc., a San Jose market
research firm that sponsored the speech to high-tech leaders, said
the relaxation of restrictions on joint ventures was welcomed in
Silicon Valley.
   ``There may be real prospects for technology deals,'' Wilson
said. ``But it's still a long march to develop any kind of a market
there. These deals are hard to put together.''

<TEXT>
   Heavyweight champ Mike Tyson says he credits his
sense of humor, picked up on the streets of Brooklyn, for helping
him through a year of seemingly unceasing media scrutiny of his
private life.
   ``That Brooklyn sense of humor _ that's like no other place in
the world,'' Tyson said in an interview in today's New York Post.
``If I took all that stuff as serious as it appeared, man, I really
would be manic.''
   Tyson, who will defend his title against Frank Bruno in Las Vegas
Saturday, says he occasionally visits his old Brownsville
neighborhood, ``but since crack nothing's the same, nothing good's
happening, my old friends are gone or dead or worse.
   ``I see these guys on crack, like zombies, no will, no spirit.
Something's got to be done about that ... but it would be
un-Christian to say what I think should be done.''

<TEXT>
   Algerian voters overwhelmingly approved a new
constitution that paves the way for a multi-party system for the
first time since independence from France in 1962.
   More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday's
balloting voted for the constitutional change, according to results
announced today by the Interior Ministry.
   The constitution extends the process of political and social
reform that President Chadli Bendjedid promised after a week of
riots last October left 176 people dead by official count.
Government offices were the main targets of rioters.
   About 80 percent of the 13 million voters in this former French
colony in North Africa cast ballots, the ministry said.
   Interior Minister Aboubakr Belkaid said the new constitution
``opens the way to a new era.'' He said it will allow his country
``to know more democracy, to assure public and individual liberties,
and to establish the sovereignty of the law.''
   Although it does not specifically authorize political parties to
compete with the ruling National Liberation Front in this nation of
25 million, the new constitution declares ``the right to create
associations of a political character.''
   Since Bendjedid, 59, announced the draft constitution, various
groups have begun forming. Among them are the leftist Democratic
Union, the Islamic Salute Front and the Berber's Rally for Culture
and Democracy.
   Ahmed Mahsas, a former agricultural minister, announced formation
of the Union of Democratic Forces on Thursday, the official Algerian
Press Service reported.
   It was the third national referendum in less than four months.
   In November, 92 percent of the voters approved political reforms
that began reducing the power of the ruling party, Algeria's only
legal political organization. The next month, about 81 percent
elected Bendjedid to a third five-year term.
   October's riots were rooted in economic problems brought by low
world prices for oil, the nation's chief export. Many Algerians
blamed the centralized, socialist government for failing to solve
the problems.
   The proposed constitution also guarantees freedom of expression
and, within limits, the right to strike. It would restrict the army
to defending the ``national independence, the unity and territorial
integrity of the country.''
   Under the current charter, the army has a role in ``development
of the country and the building of socialism.''
   Also dropped is a declaration that ``the Algerian state is
socialist.'' The new text does not refer to socialism.
   However, Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic the
official language.

<TEXT>
   A suitcase filled with dummy weapons used to train
security personnel triggered a real-life emergency drill at Miami
International Airport as a jumbo jet was ordered off a runway and a
busy terminal was evacuated.
   ``It looked like a normal suitcase,'' airport spokeswoman Amalia
Fernandez said Thursday. ``There were two imitation hand grenades
and a fake firearm, like a pistol. There was also a fake explosive
device complete with a detonator and tubes.''
   The suitcase, a demonstration kit belonging to a London-based
security manager for Pan American World Airways, originally cleared
customs in London and was supposed to be loaded onto Pan Am Flight
445 to Caracas, Venezuela, said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon in
New York.
   Airport security spotted the bag after it was left behind by
mistake, and immediately called the Pan Am Airbus A-300 off the
runway for a security check, delaying the flight by an hour, Ms.
Hanlon said.
   They also closed the airport's international flight terminal for
about 30 minutes, causing minor flight delays but no cancellations,
said Ms. Fernandez.
   ``Normally, we would hear from airline somehow,'' Ms. Fernandez
said. ``We were not notified of this ... and, of course, when you
see that in our security screening system, it looks like the real
thing.''
   Pan Am's London security office was supposed to send a message to
the airlines' Miami office and to security personnel at the airport
warning them of the kit, Ms. Hanlon said.
   ``We believe it was sent, but somehow it was not received,'' she
said. ``It's one of those miscommunications that are unfortunate.''
   Security seminars held throughout the Pan Am system have used the
fake weapons kits for some time, Ms. Hanlon said.
   She said the anti-terrorism classes were routine long before a
bomb exploded on Pan Am's Flight 103 from London last December,
killing all 259 people aboard in a crash in Lockerbie, Scotland.

<HEAD>Tony Lo Bianco Stars as ``Hizzoner!'' on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs of other reviews; no PMs planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the exclamation point, there's not much
to cheer in ``Hizzoner!'' _ a one-man show based on the life of
Fiorello H. LaGuardia.
   The play, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Longacre Theater,
seems like a textbook recitation about one of New York's most famous
and colorful mayors. Little of that color comes through in
playwright Paul Shyre's theatrical biography which smacks of
extensive research but little imagination.
   Shyre sets his play in 1945 on the mayor's last day in office.
While LaGuardia is cleaning out his desk, he also dusts off his
memories, giving the audience a dry, rather straightforward
accounting of his life. Shyre makes it sound like a resume.
   There are no surprises and very little insight into the man who
not only was mayor of New York for 12 years but also a congressman,
a clerk in the U.S. foreign service, an Army pilot and a tireless
champion of the underdog.
   Whatever heart the evening has comes from the hard work of actor
Tony Lo Bianco who invests the play with an energy that rarely
flags. Lo Bianco has to work doubly hard, too. During a preview last
week, he broke an ankle sliding down a fire pole. He continued with
the performance but now wears a black foot cast.
   The cast hasn't hampered the actor's movement around designer
Eldon Elder's credible recreation of the mayor's City Hall office.
In fact, it adds to the performance, giving Lo Bianco a jaunty gait
as he makes his way back and forth across the stage.
   The actor's physical resemblance to LaGuardia is amazing. His
bulldog frame suggests the great man's height and weight, and he has
down pat that peculiar way the mayor scrunched up his face when he
got excited. For the most part, he also captures LaGuardia's voice,
a high-pitched, almost squeaky way of talking.
   Lo Bianco is at his best in several of the imaginary press
conferences he holds with newspaper reporters. The mayor's banter
doesn't stop and neither does Lo Bianco in his efforts to get the
last bit of humor out of each joke.
   Famous names _ Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Moses, Jimmy Walker,
Gypsy Rose Lee, Calvin Coolidge, Dorothy Parker _ are dropped into
the evening at regular intervals, but their associations with
LaGuardia are not as interesting as the mayor's personal revelations
about the death of his first wife and child, his father's Army
career or occasional thoughts about being mayor of New York.
   The best moment in the play occurs near the end when LaGuardia
muses on the price of progress. He worries about the homeless men
bulldozed into oblivion when their shacks near the Hudson River are
torn down to start construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway. Was the
project worth the human cost?
   But that introspection is rare in ``Hizzoner!'' The play is more
concerned with events, presented in the most prosaic way possible.
LaGuardia's various political campaigns _ successful and
unsuccessful _ are related in often confusing detail and eventually
blur together. Director John Going hasn't found a way to separate
them on stage.
   Other famous moments are glossed over. When LaGuardia reads the
comics over the radio during a newspaper strike, it falls flat. The
incident is well-known, but seems an afterthought to the meandering
second act which repeats many of the devices _ press conferences,
radio programs _ used in Act 1.
   LaGuardia's life certainly had enough drama for a theater piece.
The creators of ``Fiorello!'' captured it 30 years ago in the
Pulitzer Prize-winning musical. ``Hizzoner!'' hasn't. It has put the
biographical facts but not the man himself on stage.
   In other reviews:
   The New York Post's Clive Barnes says Lo Bianco ``cuts an
engaging and persuasive figure as LaGuardia.'' But, he says, the
play's ``basic trouble is that its sole character appears to be
running for office as much as appearing in a play.''
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News wrote that: ```Hizzoner!' has the
faults of most one-person shows based on famous people. It quickly
becomes a history lesson.'' Kissel says Lo Bianco ``gives LaGuardia
a vulgarity, a buffoonishness that diminishes the Little Flower
unfairly.''
   In The New York Times, Mel Gussow wrote that the LaGuardia
presented in the play, ``would win few votes either as a candidate
or as a comedian.''

   President Bush, a self-proclaimed Texan, is taking
handmade, black leather cowboy boots to Beijing as gifts for China's
top leaders.
   Moreover, Bush will throw a Texas-style barbecue in Beijing on
Sunday night in return for a banquet his Chinese hosts are giving in
his honor Saturday night in the Great Hall of the People.
   In two days of meetings in the Chinese capital, Bush will confer
with 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader, as well
as President Yang Shangkun, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang and Premier Li Peng.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, said the president had
the boots made for the four Chinese leaders by R.J. Boot Co. of
Houston.
   An American flag is emblazoned on the right boot and the Chinese
flag on the left boot of each pair, she said. Ms. Perez said she did
not know how the bootmaker determined the leaders' shoe sizes.
   The president's Sunday night banquet will feature barbecued beef,
chicken, sausage and baked beans. Ms. Perez said Bush also wants to
import a popular Texas beer, Lone Star, for the occasion.
   Bush also is carrying a gift of a golf putter for South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo. Bush will visit Seoul briefly Monday on his
way back to Washington.

   Protesters denouncing Emperor Hirohito
as ``mankind's biggest war criminal'' burned Japanese flags in two
cities today and riot police blocked demonstrators from marching on
the Japanese Embassy.
   Riot police with shields dispersed about 70 protesters who tried
to march to the embassy after 200 people held an anti-Japanese rally
in a park and burned a flag to denounce Japanese war crimes. Police
took 10 marchers into custody.
   ``Japan must apologize!'' and ``Let's drive out U.S. and Japanese
influence!'' protesters shouted.
   In the southern city of Pusan, about 60 protesters burned a
Japanese flag near the Japanese consulate and demanded Japan
apologize for war atrocities, according to Yonhap, the South Korean
news agency.
   Protesters in Seoul tried to march to the Japanese Embassy to
demand an apology for Japan's harsh treatment of South Korea under
the colonial rule of Hirohito, whose funeral was held today in Tokyo.
   Japan occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945.
   ``Hirohito was mankind's biggest war criminal and our national
foe,'' said a statement by protesters. ``Japan has never made a
formal apology to the Koreans for their wrongdoings.''
   Moon Il-kwan, one of the backers of the nation's largest
dissident alliance, was among those detained by police in Seoul.
   Protesters in Seoul also shouted anti-American slogans and
denounced the scheduled visit Monday of President Bush. Radicals
have called for protests Saturday and Monday to protest the Bush
trip.
   Police said a security alert was in effect from noon today until
midnight Monday to block any protests against Bush. Riot police
squads were posted at intersections, government buildings and some
embassies today in Seoul.
   Radical students staged anti-government protests today at three
Seoul colleges to denounce the government and the United States.
   In minor clashes, protesters at Sungshil and Sejong universities
hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police.
   At Seoul National University, about 100 students held a peaceful
anti-U.S. rally to demand Bush cancel his stop in Seoul and burned a
paper effigy that students said represented the U.S. and South
Korean governments.
   Radical students and dissidents have said weekend protestes will
also be aimed at the government of South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo, which celebrates its first anniversary Saturday.
   Radicals claim the Roh government is a military dictatorship
propped up by the United States and demand the 42,000 U.S. troops in
the country under a mutual defense treaty be removed.
   The radicals have little popular support, but authorities have
expressed concern about their threat to hold violent protests.

   About 6,000 protesters shouted
anti-government slogans and burned a banner with the image of
President Corazon Aquino at a leftist rally today on the eve of her
third anniversary in power.
   Demonstrators chanted ``Cory, Cory, puppet of the Americans!''
and unfurled a large banner reading ``Aquino Regime, American
Puppet, Filipino Traitor.''
   The rally took place at Mendiola Bridge, about 300 yards from the
presidential palace, one day before the third anniversary of the
Feb. 25, 1986, ouster of Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino plans to return Saturday from the funeral of Japanese
Emperor Hirohito in time to join in festivities marking the
overthrow of Marcos, who is in poor health and in exile in Hawaii.
   In a statement distributed during the rally, organizers said that
contrary to Mrs. Aquino's claims, ``There is no evidence of
fundamental and significant differences between her reign and that
of her hated predecessor, the U.S.-Marcos dictatorship.''
   Organizers said Mrs. Aquino had ``squandered a historic
opportunity to undertake thorough social reform.''
   About 200 policemen, backed by three firetrucks, stood guard
during the rally. It ended without incident.

<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old man serving as a juror in a
drug-related murder trial was arrested on charges he tried to enter
the downtown courthouse carrying a hidden bag of cocaine.
   Gary M. Lewis of Baltimore was arrested upon his return from a
lunch break when a metal detector went off and authorities found a
zippered pouch containing the drugs inside his coat.
   ``It just goes to show you that it is possible to get a jury of
your peers,'' a court official said.
   Lewis was charged with possession of cocaine and possession of
cocaine with intent to distribute, authorities said.
   Lewis was a juror in the first-degree murder trial of Lucien C.
Derbigney, who is accused of killing a 66-year-old man during what
prosecutors described as a narcotics dispute last September.
   According to Leonard Santivasci, a deputy chief in the sheriff's
office, Lewis returned to the courthouse carrying a bag from a
fast-food restaurant and when he entered the Clarence M. Mitchell
Jr. Courthouse, a metal detector alarm sounded.
   A deputy told Lewis to empty his pockets and sent him back
through the detector, but the alarm went off again.
   The deputy used a hand-held scanner to check Lewis and found a
brown leather pouch stashed in his inside coat pocket, allegedly
containing cocaine with a street value of about $750, police said.
   Apparently, the pouch's metal zipper and two cigarette lighters
activated the metal detector, authorities said.
   ``He made no statement. All I said to him was: `Is this coke?'
And he said, `Yeah,''' said Santivasci.
   Lewis was dismissed from the jury, and Judge Elsbeth Levy Bothe,
who is presiding over the trial, told him not to discuss the case
with anyone at the jail.
   It was the second time in three months that drugs were
confiscated from someone entering the courthouse.
   On Nov. 21, Jerome Kesler, 19, was charged with possession of
heroin and possession of heroin with intent to distribute.

<HEAD>Fighting In Cambodia Escalates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting between guerrillas and
Vietnamese forces in Cambodia is escalating as the two sides try to
bolster their positions prior to a political settlement, a Thai
military spokesman said today.
   The two sides have ``renewed battles to extend areas of
influence, particularly in anticipation of Vietnam's troop
withdrawal from Cambodia and cessation of all aid to warring
parties,'' said the spokesman, Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth.
   ``The combatants are competing for territory, seeking ways to
maximize their advantage before a political settlement is reached,''
he said at a monthly news conference.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended nearly four years
of rule by the brutal Khmer Rouge during which an estimated 2
million of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Vietnamese forces and troops of the Vietnamese-installed
government are now opposed by the Khmer Rouge and two other less
powerful guerrilla groups, all three of which receive sanctuary in
Thailand.
   Naruedol said the fighting escalated during the peace talks that
ended Tuesday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   The talks ended without any new agreements, but the issue goes to
other forums in the coming months and all sides say the momentum is
toward a negotiated settlement. Naruedol noted the summit in May
between the Soviet Union, which arms Vietnam, and China, which arms
the guerrillas.
   The Vietnamese have pledged to withdraw from Cambodia next year.
   Renewed clashes during the Jakarta talks have been reported
between the Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge in the Phnom Malai area
on the central sector of the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Further south, the Vietnamese have fired 302 artillery rounds of
artillery into the Borai area the past month, said Capt. Patana
Jiranant of the Thai military.

<TEXT>
   A Broadway producer-investor was ready to flee
the country when she was arrested for stealing more than $1 million
by telling investors she was the ``secret wife'' of David
Rockefeller, a prosecutor said.
   Adela Holzer, an investor in the Broadway shows ``Hair,''
``Lenny,'' and ``The Ritz,'' was indicted Thursday, and she remains
in jail without bail on a charge of first-degree grand larceny in
connection with the alleged scheme, Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said.
   He said Ms. Holzer conducted the scheme between April 1988 until
her arrest last week and was about to flee the country when she was
picked up by authorities outside her mid-Manhattan apartment
building.
   She is scheduled to be arraigned March 8.
   Morgenthau said Ms. Holzer convinced investors to give her money
by telling them she was secretly married to Rockefeller, retired
chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. He said she promised investors
that Rockefeller would invest their money and obtain profits of 48
percent to 82 percent within 90 days.
   Morgenthau displayed two fake marriage certificates which showed
she had married Rockefeller in Madrid, Spain.
   Prosecutors alleged that Ms. Holzer victimized one investor,
Brian Griffiths, a New York City investment counselor, of $1
million, and other investors of smaller amounts.
   The six-count indictment lists five people allegedly swindled by
Ms. Holzer, but Morgenthau said his office knew of at least 26
people from whom she had obtained money ostensibly for investment.
   Robert Koppelman, Holzer's attorney, said: ``The true facts are
not as they appear in the indictment. At a trial, the truth will
emerge and my client will be vindicated.''
   The first-degree grand larceny charge carries a maximum term of
25 years in prison upon conviction.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in moderate European trading early
today, its gradual slide this week halted by signs of rising U.S.
interest rates. Gold and silver prices fell in Europe.
   Dealers said trading was subdued by the closure of financial
markets in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito. They said the
dollar made ground when the U.S. Federal Reserve Board sent
short-term interest rates higher and two U.S. banks raised their
prime interest rates Thursday.
   Selected dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8288 West German marks, up from 1.8215
   _1.5585 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535
   _6.2330 French francs, up from 6.2125
   _2.0610 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590
   _1,347.00 Italian lire, up from 1,344.50
   _1.1977 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7575 from $1.7595 late
Thursday.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 126.60 Japanese yen, up from
126.29 yen in Tokyo at Thursday's close.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $389.75 a troy ounce,
down from $391.50 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $389.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $389.50, down from $391.75 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $390.68.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.95 a troy
ounce, down from $6.04 bid late Thursday.

   Two men in stocking masks stole $2 million in
gold after handcuffing three women inside a gold merchant's office
in midtown Manhattan, police say.
   No one was hurt in the robbery Thursday afternoon inside Seville
Marketing, said a police spokesman, Detective Joseph McConville.
   The men, who carried handguns, handcuffed a receptionist and the
wives of the company's owners and bound their ankles with tape
before stealing the finished gold _ a highly-refined, jewelry
quality form of the metal.
   Police said one of the masked robbers apparently entered the
fifth-floor office after a woman allowed him into the building by
activating an electronic buzzer on an outer door.
   ``Then the second guy slipped in, at which point they both put on
ski masks and pushed through the inner door, which has a lock on it
but happened to be broken,'' said Aaron H. Rosenthal, the chief of
Manhattan detectives.
   Rosenthal said the women reported that the men stuffed the gold
into two duffel bags and a suitcase and then fled.
   The women freed themselves a short time later and called police.

<HEAD>Bookstore Chain Proclaims Position on `The Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A bookstore chain that initially withdrew ``The Satanic Verses''
from its shelves for fear of terrorist attack went on the offensive
today, saying it will continue to sell the book despite ``many
threats of violence.''
   Waldenbooks, one of the nation's largest chains, ran
advertisements in nine newspapers defending its decision to stop
displaying the book, which has been condemned by Moslems worldwide.
   ``We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock
at the publisher,'' declared the ads, signed by Harry Hoffman,
president and chief executive officer of the chain. ``We will
continue to use discretion in displaying the book.''
   The advertisement is headlined ``A Statement of Fact in Troubled
Times.''
   Two other large book chains, B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble,
briefly stopped selling `The Satanic Verses'' after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader, called for the execution of
its author, British novelist Salman Rushdie, and those responsible
for its publication. Those stores resumed sales of the book
Wednesday after nationwide protests.
   Waldenbooks ordered the book removed from store shelves last
Friday, but said its managers could sell it from behind the counter.
   Today's advertisement cited ``the many threats of violence made
against our stores and our people.'' A Waldenbooks spokeswoman,
Tracy Urdan, said the chain received an estimated 60 bomb threats in
the first days after the death threat was issued.
   All three of the large chains were criticized by writers' groups
for engaging in a form of censorship, but Hoffman insisted that his
employees' safety was the real issue.
   In any case, Ms. Urdan said, ``The question is moot for the time
being because there are no more books in stock and there won't be
until March 10.''
   Viking Penguin, the U.S. publisher of ``The Satanic Verses,'' is
reportedly printing 15,000 copies and has plans for another 50,000
within two weeks, The New York Times reported today.
   The Times said an unidentified book wholesaler predicted the book
would sell 500,000 copies in hardcover, making it a huge best-seller.
   In Chicago, speakers at a rally Thursday urged people to buy the
book to register support for Rushdie.
   ``Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism.
Let's vote with our wallets. Buy (Rushdie's) book,'' said Larry
Heinemann, winner of the 1987 National Book Award for his novel
``Paco's Story.''
   Speaking to more than 300 fellow writers and supporters at the
Chicago Public Library's Cultural Center, celebrated Chicago
Sun-Times gossip columnist Irv Kupcinet said, ``If good people don't
stand up and act ... evil takes over.''
   A small group of Chicago Moslems attended the rally, handing out
brochures condemning Rushdie's book for insulting Islam in a manner
that ``scandalizes and maligns'' Muslims' beliefs.
   ``We don't agree with the death threat or the bounty,'' said
Mohammad Kaiseruddin, president of Chicago's Muslim Community
Center. ``But we are still very offended by passages in `The Satanic
Verses' that use profanity to describe the prophets Abraham and
Mohammed.''
   The Indian-born Rushdie, 4l, went into hiding in England last
week after learning of Khomeini's death threat.

<TEXT>
   An Irish soldier with the United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon was killed today by ``unprovoked
fire'' from Israeli-allied militiamen, a U.N. spokesman said.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in south
Lebanon, UNIFIL, said the peacekeeper was shot in the chest by
machine gun fire from a South Lebanon Army position overlooking an
Irish post in the southern village of Hadatta.
   The predominantly Christian SLA, trained and financed by Israel,
assists the 1,000 Israeli troops in patrolling Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Israel established the 8-to-10 mile security zone along the
border in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.
   ``Death was instantanous,'' said Goksel. ``The fire was not
provoked.''
   Tension escalated recently between the two groups, with two
Scandanavian soldiers wounded earlier this month.
   The 5,800-strong UNIFIL, comprising contingents from nine
nations, has been deployed in south Lebanon under a peacekeeping
mandate from the United Nations since 1978.
   A total of 160 peacekeepers have been killed in south Lebanon the
past 11 years.
   Today's killing brought the overall death toll of the 700-strong
Irish batallion in Lebanon to 27.

<HEAD>Anti-Nuclear Group Says Governor Backs Down From Earlier Warnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus said he acted in the
interests of national security when he partially lifted a ban on the
shipments of nuclear waste into the state.
   But anti-nuclear activists said the issue is not national
security, but a burgeoning radioactive waste supply with no place to
go.
   Andrus announced Thursday that he will allow temporary shipments
of transuranic and low-level radioactive waste into the state. The
shipments are to come only from the U.S. Department of Energy's
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, and only for the next
six months.
   The governor said two railroad boxcars per month will be accepted
from the Rocky Flats site near Denver to avoid a ``serious national
security crisis'' if the facility closed down.
   An average of four boxcars per month were shipped from the
Colorado plant to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory before
Andrus closed Idaho's borders to waste shipments last Oct. 19.
   Partially lifting the ban on new shipments will allow Rocky Flats
to remain open and give the DOE time to clear up problems that have
delayed opening of its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a permanent
waste storage site near Carlsbad, N.M.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, and Rep. Richard Stallings, D-Idaho,
both supported Andrus' decision. McClure called it ``recognition of
the fact that this is a national issue that has clear and serious
implications for our deterrent forces.''
   But Elizabeth Paul, the executive director of the anti-nuclear
Snake River Alliance, criticized the governor for softening his
stance since January, when he said the DOE should stop producing
weapons if it cannot come up with long-term waste solutions.
   Ms. Paul said there is ``no reasonable evidence'' that shutting
down Rocky Flats would jeopardize national security.
   Another Snake River board member, Fritz Bjornsen, agreed, saying,
``The crisis is in radioactive waste management, not national
security.''

<HEAD>Owner Of Seabrook Doubts Plant Will Operate For Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant won't
operate commercially for another two years, if at all, one owner
told the lead owner's bankruptcy judge.
   ``I think it is more likely than not that Seabrook will run. But
it is still a very uncertain situation. It changes on a daily
basis,'' said Robert Busch, a Northeast Utilities senior vice
president.
   Testifying at a Public Service Co. of New Hampshire bankruptcy
hearing Thursday, Busch said Northeast's proposed acquisition of
Public Service _ which would spin off that utility's Seabrook
investment into a separate company _ assumes Seabrook will operate
by mid-1991.
   Other Northeast and Seabrook officials stressed that the
company's estimate of May 1991 is for financial-planning purposes
and may be conservative.
   It is 16 months later than the estimate used by Public Service.
   The $5.8 billion plant, finished in 1986, remains idle for lack
of a federal operating license.
   Rob Williams, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, Public
Service's Seabrook management division, played down the Northeast
projection. He said financial-planning estimates, used in dealings
with utility regulators and lenders, are by their nature ``very
conservative.''
   ``It appears to us that the licensing process will be completed
by the end of the year,'' Williams said.
   Commercial operation should follow soon afterward, he added.
   Public Service spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said he was concerned
that differences in owners' financial-planning estimates on Seabrook
may be perceived as meaning that ``Seabrook has slipped again.''
   ``That is really not accurate,'' Ashooh said.
   ``Some (owners) are more conservative than others,'' Ashooh said.
   Meantime, Public Service said it will make a new offer to state
officials next month on electricity rate increases it seeks to
emerge from bankruptcy protection.
   Public Service's chief financial officer, Charles Bayless, made
the disclosure Thursday as he tried to show a federal bankruptcy
judge that there still are prospects for a reorganization settlement
that would avert lengthy, expensive litigation.
   The state, the utility and its creditors have been locked in
dispute over a key issue in the reorganization _ what rates Public
Service will be able to charge for its 36 percent share of the
completed but stalled Seabrook plant.
   The company also announced it had settled a securities-fraud
lawsuit brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that
helped pay for completing the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Northeast, New England's largest power company, wants to buy
Public Service's non-Seabrook assets, and has made a bid that it
says is worth about $2 billion if Seabrook operates.
   Northeast is stressing its experience with nuclear plants, having
built the three-reactor Millstone project in Connecticut. Busch was
project manager for Millstone 3, which he said began commercial
operation about two weeks ahead of schedule in April 1986.

   Although careful to separate religion and the modern
democratic state, organizers of today's grand funeral for Emperor
Hirohito drew deeply from Japan's Shinto rites and ancient
traditions.
   Court music was played, classical poetry read and costumes of
another era worn although government officials said the funeral
ceremony was pared down in length and pomp to ``conform to the
times.''
   The funeral lasted more than 13 hours; the 1927 funeral of
Hirohito's father, Emperor Taisho, took a day and a half and
mourners dared not even look at the hearse bearing Taisho's body.
   Japanese today snapped photographs of the funeral procession, and
Hirohito's son Emperor Akihito carried his own umbrella.
   He delivered a eulogy in common speech, rather than the elaborate
courtly language used for such events in the past.
   But the main funeral ceremony at the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens,
led by the new emperor, was still steeped in the rituals of Shinto,
the indigenous religion which predates yet still co-exists with
Buddhism.
   Sensitive to Japan's postwar constitution, which insists on
separation of religion and state and relegates the emperor to a
figurehead role, the funeral organizers stressed such a duality in
the ceremonies.
   An actual curtain of black color was drawn after the completion
of the Shinto ceremony at the gardens and reopened before the start
of the state funeral. The curtain separated some 9,800 invited
mourners and the imperial family from the hall where Hirohito's body
lay.
   The sound of flutes and ancient court music heralded the start of
the elaborate procession led by Akihito into the funeral grounds.
Empress Michiko, in a flowing black dress and matching veil,
followed a few steps behind.
   Dignitaries, representing 163 nations, were bundled up in dark,
woolen blankets at their seats in a large tent.
   Once Hirohito's coffin was in place in the funeral hall,
specially constructed of Japanese cypress, ritualists made
offerings, including silk and food, to Hirohito, marking the start
of the Shinto ceremonies.
   Dressed in mourning black with a top hat and gloves clutched in
his left hand, a solemn Akihito entered the hall through the
traditional Shinto `torii' gate and bowed deeply. Stepping up to the
altar, he read from a speech handed to him by a chamberlain and bid
a final farewell to his father.
   After he left, Empress Michiko entered the hall, where she
offered a sacred `sakaki' branch to the late emperor.
   Ancient myths hold that gods dwell in the sakaki, or evergreen
trees, which are often used in Shinto rituals as offerings to
deities.
   Chamberlains later removed the offerings from the hall and the
black curtain was drawn to signal the end of the 47-minute Shinto
ceremony.
   By the start of the state funeral a short while later, the
`torii' gate and small tables at the altar had been removed. A
speech by chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi signaled the
beginning.
   Imperial family members again walked up to the funeral hall and
bowed. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other government
representatives offered short eulogies.
   The one-hour state funeral concluded with the visiting foreign
dignitaries stepping up to the hall and bowing to the late emperor
and his family.

   Many Japanese bid an affectionate farewell today to
the emperor who led them through a devastating war and into great
prosperity. But for others, the funeral was an occasion to denounce
the system he represented.
   ``Hirohito is the greatest of war criminals during World War II
with Hitler and Mussolini,'' said a 36-year-old high school teacher
among about 400 demonstrators who gathered at one Tokyo park.
   Protesters from three leftist groups displayed banners denouncing
the $74 million funeral and attacking Hirohito for his role as
titular leader during Japan's World War II aggression.
   ``Under the name of Hirohito, our mothers and fathers were
mobilized for war in Asia and thousands of people were massacred,''
said the teacher, who refused to give his name.
   Opponents of the imperial system associate it with militarism and
remind their countrymen that the emperor's name was used to rally
support for Japan's invasion of much of Asia during World War II.
   Until the end of the war, the emperor also stood at the head of
the state Shinto religion, which was used to justify strong central
control by the government and the suppression of human and religious
rights.
   Civil servants at a municipal office in Japan's southwestern
prefecture of Okinawa voted to come to work today despite the
government's designation of the day as a special national holiday in
Hirohito's honor.
   Resentment against Hirohito remains strong on the island, where
about 210,000 Japanese civilians and soldiers died in the fiercest
fighting on apanese territory of World War II.
   About 210,000 people lined the route taken by a funeral motorcade.
   Most appeared curious, braving a cold drizzle to crane their
necks at the cortege, eagerly snapping pictures as the slow-moving
hearse and its imperial motorcycle escort came into view. A few shed
tears.
   But at 11 other locations in Tokyo, about 4,300 people took part
in anti-emperor demonstrations, police said, including about 800 who
shouted slogans through loudspeakers as they marched 2{ miles.
   Authorities arrested five people, including two who broke through
police lines and ran into a street along the funeral route.
   National police said they had no figures on demonstrations
elsewhere in Japan. But in Hiroshima, about 30 people staged a
sit-in in front of the Atomic Dome, the remnants of a domed building
gutted by an atomic bomb in August 1945.
   Shortly after the United States dropped the bomb, Hirohito
announced Japan's surrender.
   For some mourners in Tokyo it proved an emotional sendoff as they
lined up many rows deep and bowed their heads as Hirohito's coffin
passed by.
   Eitaro Ohya, 77, recalled watching the 1927 funeral procession
for Emperor Taisho, Hirohito's father.
   ``I remember keeping my head bowed so low because the emperor was
considered a god that I saw nothing,'' Ohya recalled. ``But this
time I watched. It is a great honor to witness two emperors'
funerals.''
   Others were bitter. Kazumasa Miyamoto, 70, said, ``I was forced
to do construction work in China in the name of Emperor Hirohito and
had a hard time. We should not spend money for such a funeral.''
   The holiday kept department stores, restaurants, movie theaters
and other places of entertainment shut down. Large sections of the
city were blocked off to traffic and most residents stayed home or
headed out of Tokyo.
   Across the capital only a few small stores and restaurants
remained open.
   In the Nakano district, where Marxists staged a protest, many of
the demonstrators had lunch at the only eatery open: a Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlet where the staff wore black mourning ribbons.

   Prosecutors played videotapes of jewelers
counting money stacked to the ceiling as they argued against bail
for gem store employees arrested in a $1 billion cocaine
money-laundering network.
   Three of the defendants were ordered held without bail Thursday.
But U.S. Magistrate Ralph J. Geffen allowed $1.25 million bail for
Rita Sorfazian as well as $50,000 bail each for two gem store clerks.
   In arguing against bail for Mrs. Sorfazian, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Russell Hayman said the government ``does not have the
resources'' to wipe out the sophisticated money-laundering network
attacked Wednesday with arrests of dozens of people at the downtown
jewelry district and other locations worldwide.
   ``If we let her out, are we letting her out to work for one of
the jewelers we know are still doing this?'' he asked.
   Ms. Sorfazian has yet to post bail.
   Thirty-seven people were charged Wednesday with taking in at
least $1 billion through merchants in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida
and New York, then sending the laundered cash to Colombian drug
lords.
   The defendants also were charged with aiding and abetting the
distribution of 640 pounds of cocaine seized during the
investigation.
   Hayman alleged the network may have been involved with importing
as much as 44,000 pounds of the drug.
   U.S. Magistrate John R. Kronenberg agreed to postpone a bail
hearing for two key figures in the case, Nazareth and Vahe Andonian,
until Monday. The men had asked for time to hire lawyers.
   The Andonian brothers and Wanis ``Joseph'' Koyomejian, 47, owner
of the Ropex Corp., have been identified by authorities as leaders
in the operation. Koyomejian and another alleged ring leader, Sergio
Hochman, were ordered held without bail.
   Hayman argued that Mrs. Sorfazian was responsible at Ropex for
making almost daily wire transfers of cash to New York, Panama and
elsewhere.
   Defense attorney Denise Meyer claimed her client was a secretary
at Ropex Corp. who took home $215 a week. Mrs. Sorfazian thought she
was working for a gold bullion exchange house that legitimately
converted cash to gold, Ms. Meyer said.
   The prosecutor showed a surveillance videotape in which Mrs.
Sorfazian and three other defendants were seen feeding money into
two high-speed counting machines. Hayman said that at times during
the government surveillance, the bills ``were literally stacked to
the ceiling.''
   Joyce and Zephur Moroyan, Lebanese-born sisters who worked as
clerks for the Andonians, were granted $50,000 bail each.
   Other defendants in the case were ordered held without bail:
Bedros Akpulat, 30, owner of Fancy Jewelry in downtown Los Angeles;
Dalida Avakian, who is Mrs. Sorfazian's sister; and Agop Koyomejian,
Wanis Koyomejian's brother.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
opened talks with his Iraqi counterpart today aimed at breaking a
deadlock in Persian Gulf peace talks and finding a solution to the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Shevardnadze arrived late Thursday for a two-day visit, saying he
was concerned about lack of progress in the Iraq-Iran peace
negotiations. He has also been using his 10-day regional tour to
promote Soviet proposals for peace between Israeli and Arab
neighbors.
   The Soviet official started his talks today with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz. He also was to meet with President Saddam
Hussein.
   The Soviet minister leaves for Tehran on Saturday, where he has
been granted a rare audience with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   East bloc diplomats say Shevardnadze is expected to press Iraqi
and Iranian leaders to work toward a peace treaty in the
negotiations being conducted under the auspices of the United
Nations. The Iran-Iraq war ended in a cease-fire in August, but the
two sides have made little progress in peace talks since then.
   Shevardnadze arrived in Baghdad from Cairo, where he said
Thursday that Israel must agree to talk with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and agree to take part in an international
peace conference under U.N. auspices if the Kremlin is to restore
diplomatic ties with the Jewish state.
   Israel opposes a U.N.-organized conference but has said it would
go to one under the auspices of the United States and the Soviet
Union. But the Israelis vow never to talk with the PLO, which they
consider a terrorist organization.
   Shevardnadze met separately with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Cairo on Wednesday. Arafat
said the Soviets are providing him an indirect channel to the
Israelis through increased contacts set up this week in Cairo.

   The governor has promised to sign a bill
passed by the General Assembly that would make Virginia the first
state in the nation to require instant criminal checks on buyers of
some handguns and assault rifles.
   The bill, passed Thursday by the Senate and the House of
Delegates, requires criminal background checks of residents buying
handguns with barrels shorter than 5 inches or assault rifles with
ammunition clips of more than 20 rounds.
   State police told legislators a computerized search for records
of felony convictions could be made during the course of a phone
call.
   Out-of-state residents would have to submit to a more complicated
background check that could delay a purchase up to a week.
   Representatives of the NRA, the Virginia Rifle and Revolver
Association and Handgun Control Inc. all have said they could live
with the bill.
   ``The NRA is holding their noses and saying, `We don't oppose
it,''' said Del. William T. Wilson, who fought the measure. ``But I
assure you, they don't like it.''
   Wilson said the bill would inconvenience gun dealers and their
customers and would not accomplish its purpose of keeping guns away
from criminals.
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles said the bill would change Virginia's
reputation as a major East Coast exporter of crime weapons.

   The body of Emperor Hirohito today was sealed inside
a hillside crypt and offerings were made to his spirit, ending a
13-hour funeral attended by the largest gathering of world leaders
in modern history.
   A day of elaborate ceremony concluded by torchlight shortly
before 9 p.m. after the lace-draped coffin was put on a cart and
tugged 33 feet up a slope by a pulley-like device. It was then moved
inside a prepared stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed with
concrete.
   Hirohito's mound-like mausoleum is in a grove of towering cypress
trees at the Musashi Imperial Cemetary west of Tokyo.
   Worshiped as a living god and branded a war criminal during his
87-year life, Hirohito was honored by official representatives of
163 nations at some of the ceremonies, including President Bush and
his wife, Barbara.
   The Bush's sat in the front row at the funeral, covered with wool
and cashmere blankets to protect them from the winter chill. Bush,
the collar of his black overcoat turned up, paused in front of the
coffin and lowered his head in a slight bow when his turn came to
approach the coffin.
   A bomb exploded in a roadside embankment about 20 minutes before
a motorcade carrying Hirohito's body and members of the imperial
family passed by on its way to the burial ground.
   The motorcade was not delayed and no one was injured. Police said
they suspected radicals planted the bomb. They said groups opposing
the emperor system staged 11 demonstrations in the Japanese capital,
and officers arrested five people.
   A 21-gun salute opened the final, five-hour-long ceremonies of
entombment as the rainy weather that had occurred most of the day
cleared.
   The ceremonies ended with the tombside offering of 16 kinds of
food and six kinds of clothing. The imperial family, now led by
55-year-old Emperor Akihito, then returned to the Imperial Palace.
   The Kyodo News Agency said a sword, ceremonial shoes, books
written by the emperor and favorite items of clothing were buried in
the casket with Hirohito.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said more than 100 personal
belongings would be encased, including an old German-made microscope
he used in marine biological research and a recent list of rankings
of sumo wrestlers. Hirohito's favorite sport was sumo wrestling.
   ``The people will remember him forever,'' Akihito said in his
eulogy. He expressed his ``overwhelming emotion'' and ``extreme
sense of sorrow'' while thanking the people of Japan and foreign
countries who sent condolences after his father's death Jan. 7 from
cancer.
   The $74 million funeral began with private Shinto rites within
the walls of the palace in downtown Tokyo.
   The metropolis of 12 million came to a virtual standstill, and
32,000 police mounted the largest security operation in Japanese
history to protect the world leaders and contain anti-monarchy
protests.
   The day was declared a national holiday. Businesses were closed,
and many residents took advantage of the long weekend to head for
ski slopes.
   About 800 protestors burned a Japanese flag and chanted slogans
through loudspeakers as they marched for 2{ miles from Shiba Park in
the heart of Tokyo.
   Another 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered at
another park, carrying banners denouncing the funeral and attacking
Hirohito for his role as titular leader during Japan's World War II
aggression.
   ``The Tenno (Emperor) Hirohito is the greatest of war criminals
during World War II with Hitler and Mussolini,'' said a 36-year-old
high school teacher, who refused to be identified. ``Under the name
of Hirohito, our mothers and fathers were mobilized for war in Asia
and thousands of people were massacred.''
   But others cried or clasped their hands together in prayer as
Hirohito's coffin passed by.
   A 72-year-old farmer, Morie Hiroki, tried to commit suicide by
hari-kiri on the southern island of Kyushu. The World War II army
private left a note saying he felt he had to follow his emperor in
death.
   Hirohito renounced his purported divinity in 1946 as Japan began
its climb from the ashes of World War II toward spectacular economic
success.
   Police estimated 571,400 people braved the 37-degree weather to
view he funeral processions, including more than 200,000 who watched
as a black hearse carrying the coffin drove slowly through central
Tokyo along a four-mile route from the Imperial Palace to the main
ceremony at Shinjuku Imperial Gardens.
   The motorcyle-escorted, 32-car procession passed Parliament, the
democratic core of modern Japan, and the National Stadium where the
emperor opened the 1964 Summer Olympics, heralding Japan's postwar
reemergence.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko led the imperial mourners, but
Hirohito's 85-year-old widow, the Empress Dowager Nagako, did not
attend the public ceremonies due to reported poor health.
   At the Shinjuku gardens, 51 black-robed men carried the coffin on
a 22-foot-long palanquin to a wooden shrine for Shinto rites led by
Akihito. The body of Hirohito was encased in an inner wooden coffin
and an outer one of metal.
   A chamberlain dressed in white followed the bier carrying a
platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased
monarch will wear to heaven.
   Flutes and pipes, with an occasional drum beat, sounded a
plaintive tune as the procession entered the ceremonial grounds.
   Members of the imperial family _ the women in veils, men in black
tailcoats and black silk top hats _ protected themselves from the
rain with umbrellas.
   In two vast, heated tents, were the 9,800 invited mourners: a
phalanx of world leaders, Japanese government officials, private
citizens and several champions of sumo wrestling.
   Akihito delivered his four-minute eulogy, a deep-voiced male
chorus sang a solemn mourning song, a poem was read and imperial
family members went individually before the coffin and bowed slowly.
   Shinto attendants wore black robes and traditional headgear, and
eight men carried two sacred evergreen trees while others bore tall
banners with imperial symbols of the sun and moon and chests
containing ceremonial offerings.
   After the religious ceremony, Shinto appurtenances were removed
and the state funeral began with a minute of silence.
   In his eulogy, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita described
Hirohito's 62-year reign as ``eventful and turbulent times for
Japan, including the calamities of that deplorable war, the struggle
to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and dire poverty
and to regain its full independence.''
   ``During all these years, Emperor Showa ardently wished for world
peace and the well-being of the Japanese people,'' he said,
referring to Hirohito by his posthumous name.
   After the eulogies, the Bush's stepped to the front of the hall,
paused and made a slight bow before the coffin. During World War II,
Bush was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire.
   Also bowing before the coffin was Britain's Prince Philip, a
Royal Navy veteran of World War II who was at Japan's surrender
ceremony in 1945.
   The Japan Communist Party boycotted the funeral and some members
of the main opposition Japan Socialist Party stayed away from the
Shinto ceremonies while attending the state ones.

   Bundled against the cold, President Bush bowed in
final respects to Emperor Hirohito at a rain-drenched funeral today
and later vowed to fight on his return to Washington to salvage the
troubled nomination of John Tower as secretary of defense.
   As Bush joined 9,800 mourners under tents at the Shinjuku
Imperial Garden ceremony, Tower's nomination was rejected in
Washington by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The vote was
11-9, split along party lines with the Democrats in the majority.
   The vote _ the first such committee rejection of a president's
Cabinet choice in 44 years _ was a major setback for Bush on his
first trip overseas as president, and came as he mingled with
leaders of more than 160 countries.
   ``I am going to strongly continue to back Sen. Tower, and I don't
believe he's going down the drain,'' Bush told reporters after the
funeral as he emerged from talks with foreign leaders at the U.S.
ambassador's residence.
   He said he had no intention of withdrawing Tower's name in favor
of a new, less controversial nominee. ``I haven't considered any
options,'' he said. ``I stand strongly with John Tower.''
   Added Bush: ``He knows that when I get back, and I will be back
before the (Senate) vote, he knows I will do whatever I can to talk
to individual members and have them know how strongly I feel about
it, and hopefully to persuade some who have looked at evidence so
far and may have a different opinion.''
   Despite the setback, Bush said he considers his honeymoon with
Congress is ``still going fine.'' But inasmuch as he wants Tower
confirmed, he said, ``I can't say it's a pat on the back.''
   Although he appeared tired from the rigors of his journey, Bush
said he felt like ``a spring colt ready to charge.''
   After paying a courtesy call on Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito,
on Saturday morning, Bush flies to Beijing for two days of talks
with Chinese leaders. He will visit South Korea briefly on Monday en
route home to Washington.
   Earlier, leaving the three-hour funeral, Bush had shown no sign
of distress over the Senate committee's vote. He gave a thumbs-up
sign and smiled as his armored limousine _ flown in specially from
Washington _ brought him back to the American ambassador's residence
   Apart from the funeral, Bush held separate meetings with
Philippine President Corazon Aquino, King Baudouin of Belgium, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, West German President Richard
von Weizsaecker, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey, Italian President Francesco Cossiga
and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Bush had a private dinner
with King Juan Carlos of Spain.
   Fitzwater said Bush assured Mrs. Aquino of U.S. support and noted
that the administration is seeking $200 million in aid for the
Philippines.
   Recognizing that Tower's nomination suddenly was in deep trouble,
White House chief of staff John Sununu was up most of the night on
long-distance telephone calls to Senate Republicans and others, said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Sununu called Tower by telephone this afternoon to
inform him of Bush's continued support. ``Sen. Tower said he knew it
would be a difficult fight but he's ready to move forward,''
Fitzwater said.
   For the first time, Fitzwater said it ``would probably be
helpful'' for the nomination to release the 140-page report on the
FBI investigation of Tower's personal life. However, he said, ``I'm
not at all sure that that can happen or that it should happen'' out
of concern for those who were interviewed.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a CBS television
interview, said Bush had not been hurt by the Tower vote. ``I don't
think it's a loss until it goes down the tubes on the floor,'' he
said, adding that he was not predicting that the nomination was lost.
   Separately, Baker said in an NBC-TV interview that ``it is not in
the best interest of the foreign policy of the United States to have
a nomination hang fire for this long.''
   Fitzwater said there was no consideration of any replacement for
Tower, ``period, bar none.''
   Bush had begun his day with calls to Washington with Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and other senators about Tower's
nomination. But even before the committee voted, Bush had to put the
matter aside to attend Hirohito's funeral.
   For the occasion, Bush had rented a morning coat in Washington,
including grey stripe pants, black vest, black tie and black cutaway
jacket with tails.
   Accompanied by his wife, Barbara, Bush was given a front-row,
center seat in one of two huge open-sided tents at the state
funeral. To give him a place of prominence, Japanese officials had
to waive protocol rules that would have put Bush toward the back
because of his short tenure in office.
   One by one, world leaders approached Hirohito's coffin to pay
respects after the formal eulogies.
   When their turn came, Bush and his wife paused in front of the
coffin and lowered their heads in a slight bow. A pelting rain and
stiff wind made the chilly day in Tokyo seem even colder.
   Bush wore a black overcoat and turned up his collar against the
wind. Along with many other mourners, Bush and his wife covered
their laps with wool and cashmere blankets placed on each seat.
   There were electrical heating coils beneath the floor and a
heater in the low wall directly in front of the president.
   Hirohito, the last of the World War II-era world leaders, died of
cancer at age 87 on Jan. 7 after reigning for six decades.
   Bush issued a statement thanking Japanese officials ``who managed
this complicated logistics and put on a marvelous pageant in honor
of the late emperor _ beautifully staged and beautifully carried
off, on schedule, working against the elements, but nevertheless
with a dignity and a ceremony that was appropriate.''
   He said he had ``great respect for what they did and the way in
which they did it, and I am proud to have represented the United
States of America here today.''
   Bush, a Navy combat pilot in World War II who was shot down by
Japanese gunners during a bombing run, said attending the funeral
was the right thing to do because Japan and the United States are
allies.
   The gesture was appreciated by the Japanese, particularly because
of lingering resentment in some quarters about Hirohito's role as a
leader during the war. Some U.S. veterans were among those who
objected to Bush's decision.
   Bush was unaffected by the only significant security incident
involving the emperor's funeral. A bomb damaged a highway along
which the emperor's hearse was due to be taken after the ceremony,
but Bush was already back at his hotel at the time. Police
speculated that radicals opposed to the emperor system were
responsible for the blast.

   President Bush vowed today to ``stand
strongly'' with Defense Secretary-designate John Tower through a
Senate floor vote despite the Armed Services Committee's rejection
of Tower's confirmation because of questions of character.
   ``I'm going to strongly continue to back Senator Tower and I
don't believe he's going down the drain,'' Bush told reporters in
Tokyo, where he was attending the funeral of Japan's Emperor
Hirohito.
   The committee, voting strictly along party lines, recommended by
11-9 Thursday night that the Senate reject Tower's nomination after
Democrats expressed continuing concerns about questions of his
character.
   ``I cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing, a
SAC bomber squadron or a Trident missile submarine,'' Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the committee chairman, said before the vote.
   Bush, faced with a political defeat at home as he made his global
debut at the Hirohito funeral, said he believed lingering doubts
about Tower would be answered when the full Senate takes up the
nomination.
   ``I am going to strongly continue to back Senator Tower,'' Bush
said as he left the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo. ``... I am
hoping that this debate that will follow next week will clear up any
questions.''
   ``I haven't considered any options. I stand strongly with John
Tower,'' said Bush.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Tokyo with Bush, said
it would be a mistake for Bush to withdraw the nomination in advance
of a vote on the Senate floor.
   ``If he now pulled it I think all of you would say, `this is a
terrible thing. It shows that his judgment was flawed from the
beginning','' Baker said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   The committee vote marked an abrupt departure from the month-long
honeymoon between the new Republican president and the Democratic
majorities of Congress, but Bush said he still believes his
relationship with Congress ``is still going fine.''
   Should the full Senate reject Tower, it would be the first time
in history a newly elected president had suffered a rejection of a
nominee to his first Cabinet. In all, eight Cabinet nominations have
been rejected, the most recent 30 years ago.
   A handful of Democrats suggested after the committee vote
Thursday night that Bush seek a replacement for Tower before next
week's scheduled floor vote. ``It doesn't do the president any
good,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. ``It's a
tremendous burden for any nominee to go to the floor with a vote of
no confidence.''
   But the White House quickly rejected that suggestion.
   ``There's no consideration of alternative candidates,''
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters traveling
with the president in Japan. ``There's no alternate list _ bar
none.''
   ``He'll be working to contact senators throughout the days ahead,
sometimes by telephone, sometimes in person,'' he said.
   Tower, a former Texas senator who had once chaired the committee,
said in a statement he was ``obviously disappointed'' but would
continue to work at the Pentagon ``and await the vote of full
Senate.''
   The strictly partisan vote climaxed an extraordinary 2{ hour
night-time committee session at which lawmakers swapped views on the
FBI's investigation into numerous allegations against him.
   Tower has been dogged by allegations about his drinking habits
and womanizing, as well as by questions of possible conflict of
interest posed by his earning hundreds of thousands of dollars as a
defense industry consultant after leaving the Senate.
   The committee's senior Republican, John Warner of Virginia, said
Bush was entitled to a Cabinet of his own choosing. Warner noted
that many of the senators who had served with Tower had been
questioned by the FBI during its investigation.
   ``Not one single U.S. senator, not one who has served with John
Tower can ever recall a single instance where any of his persoal
habits interfered with his duty,'' Warner said. ``Not one.''
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, and a strictly
party line vote on the floor would doom Tower's nomination. Still,
the prospect is for a bruising struggle leading up to an expected
vote next Wednesday or Thursday, as Bush tries to sway enough
Democratic votes to triumph in his first major confrontation with
Congress.
   Even before the committee voted, Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole made clear the importance of the issue for the president,
saying on the floor that a vote against Tower would be a ``kick in
the teeth'' to the president.
   One GOP committee member, Sen. William Cohen of Maine, also said
the party line vote would make it tougher to forge a bipartisan
defense policy.
   In his leadoff speech to the committee, Nunn expressed concern
about Tower's drinking, and said there were examples of behavior
with women which he found indiscreet, although he added the record
did not support allegations that the former senator exerted sexual
pressure on women employees and associates.
   He said there was a ``significant public perception of a conflict
of interest arising from (Tower's) receipt of large amounts of money
from major contractors in return for the services he provided.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming said Tower had undergone ``trial
by leak,'' and said, ``repetition has become a standard of truth.''
   The Democrats who voted for the motion to reject Tower were Sens.
Nunn, Byrd, James Exon of Nebraska, Carl Levin of Michigan, Jeff
Bingaman of New Mexico, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Alan
Dixon of Illinois, John Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore of Tennessee, Tim
Wirth of Colorado and Richard Shelby of Alabama.
   The Republicans who voted against the motion were Sens. Warner,
Cohen, Wallop, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Pete Wilson of
California, John McCain of Arizona, Slade Gorton of Washington,
Trent Lott of Mississippi and Dan Coats of Indiana.

   Bombay police opened fire today on a
crowd of Moslems protesting Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and at least 10 people were killed and 25 injured,
authorities said.
   Police said about 5,000 Moslems started the protest in the center
of the city after weekly prayers. Protesters set fire to several
state-run buses and other vehicles and attacked policemen on duty,
said an officer.
   Earlier, United News of India news agency reported 10 killed and
38 injured, six of them critically.
   Friday is Islam's weekly holy day, and anti-Rushdie protests were
reported elsewhere in India. There were no other reports of violence.
   The Bombay demonstrators, almost all Moslems, ignored a police
ban on the assembly of more than five people in public places. The
ban was imposed after some Moslems announced plans to protest
Rushdie's book, which some say insults Islam.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay in 1947 but now
lives in London, where he has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said he should be killed and
Iranian clerics placed a $5.2 million bounty on the author's head.
   Protests were held in several other Indian cities, United News of
India and Press Trust of India news agencies said.
   In New Delhi, about 400 Moslems marched to the British High
Commission, or embassy in the diplomatic neighborhood and protested
the novel.
   At least one person was killed in India's northern Jammu-Kashmir
state Feb. 13 during a demonstration against the book.
   Six people were killed in neighboring Pakistan on Feb. 12 when
police opened fire on a crowd that tried to set fire to the U.S.
Information Service office in Islamabad to demand the book be banned.
   India banned Rushdie's book in November, fearing it could cause
unrest.
   More than 90 million Moslems live in India, forming about 11
percent of the population of 880 million. Hindus account for 82
percent of the population.

   An American photographer and an American
model who posed in her underwear while sitting on a Buddha statue
were arrested on charges of desecrating the statue, police said
today.
   Sante Maria D'Razzio, 33, of New Jersey and Kara Ruth Young, 23,
of California were arrested Sunday after the photo session inside
Chung Len Buddhist temple in the southern island resort of Phuket,
said police Lt. Amnuey Kraiwuttianant said. Hometowns for the two
were not immediately known.
   D'Razzio was photographing Ms. Young for the French magazine
Vogue when worshipers at the temple complained to police, Amnuey
said.
   When authorities arrived, they found Ms. Young sitting in a car
in her underwear, and they seized an instant photograph taken of her
sitting on the statue, the officer said.
   The pair said they did not know they were breaking the law,
Amnuey said. Thailand is a predominately Buddhist country.
   They each could face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison
if convicted. They were released on $2,000 bail each.

   A United Airlines Boeing 747 landed in Honolulu
today with ``a big hole in the fuselage,'' according to a Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman who said ``some passengers are
missing.''
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the agency had information that
perhaps five or six passengers were missing.
   The pilot of the flight from Honolulu to Aukland, New Zealand,
reported trouble in one right-side engine and then in the other
right-side engine, Leyden said. He then returned to Honolulu.
   ``When he landed, there was a big hole in the right side of the
fuselage near the right front door and some passengers were
missing,'' Leyden said.
   Information about the incident on Flight 811 was sketchy, he
said. The plane left Honolulu at 7:53 a.m. EST, and the pilot
reported he had lost the No. 3 engine nine minutes later. Eight
minutes after that, he reported lack of power in No. 4 engine. The
plane landed at 8:34 a.m. EST.
   ``It's still early in Honolulu. There is a report of five or six
passengers missing,'' said Leyden.
   Leyden said he did not know how the hole in the fuselage and the
engine trouble were related.
   ``There are a lot of possible scenarios,'' he said, noting that
it could have been a ``contained engine failure,'' in which an
engine part penetrates the fuselage. Or, he said, an explosion from
the fuselage could affect the engines.
   ``Right now, we're just sitting here waiting for more
information,'' Leyden said.

   More than 100 World War II veterans, including
former prisoners of war, today rallied at a downtown war memorial
and denounced Emperor Hirohito of Japan on the day of his funeral.
   They also laid wreaths to commemorate their dead comrades in a
20-minute ceremony, which was held this morning to coincide with the
Tokyo funeral of Hirohito.
   Hong Kong, a British colony on the southern coast of China, was
occupied by the Japanese during World War II.
   The veterans, many wearing medals from the war, and some younger
people later marched around the stone monument with banners reading
``Hirohito was a war criminal'' and ``Down with Japanese
imperialism.''
   Some participants decried the attendance of world leaders such as
President Bush and Prince Philip of Great Britain at Hirohito's
funeral.
   Earlier today, more than a dozen youths chanting slogans opposing
what they view as Japanese militarism marched downtown and handed a
petition to the Japanese Consulate.

   A state prison warden accepted $10,000 to arrange
the transfer of an inmate from a maximum-security prison to a
medium-security prison, authorities say.
   Deputy Warden Wayne Jackson of the State Prison of Southern
Michigan was freed on $10,000 bond after being arraigned Thursday on
two counts of bribery and two counts of conspiracy to bribe before
District Court Judge Robert Crary Jr.
   He also was suspended without pay, Corrections Department
spokesman Lou Chappell said.
   Jackson, who was second in command at the prison, was accused of
accepting $7,500 in cash and a lithograph valued at $2,500 to
arrange a transfer of Stephen McCreary from the maximum-security
prison to the medium-security Western Wayne Correctional Facility at
Plymouth, state and federal authorities said.
   McCreary escaped in mid-December after being transferred again to
a minimum-security work camp. McCreary had been sentenced to life in
prison for second-degree murder in a 1977 drug-related killing in
Detroit.
   Jackson 40, faces similar federal charges and will be arraigned
later in federal court, said Attorney General Frank Kelley.
   Jackson's lawyer, James Dudus, said Jackson had no statement.
   Jackson faces up to 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines if
convicted on the state charges. He faces up to 10 years and $250,000
in fines if convicted of the federal charges.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its first report on human rights in Cuba, the
United Nations said today that Cuban prisoners complained they were
tortured but that the government denied their claims.
   The 400-page report was compiled by a six-member team that
visited Cuba for 10 days in September at the invitation of the
government.
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, made up of representatives from
43 nations, will begin discussing the report Tuesday.
   The investigating team said it received more than 1,600 human
rights complaints, including 137 of torture, cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment.
   The allegations of torture were in a letter signed by 22
political detainees and handed to two U.N. representatives who
visited Havana's Combinado del Este prison.
   ``The Cuban tormentors, advised by experts in political
repression, mainly Russians and Czechs, inflict all kinds of
torture,'' the letter said.
   The report said Cuba's interior minister, Gen. Jose Abrantes,
told the U.N. representatives that ``a number of detainees or
prisoners had in the past been beaten'' but that those responsible
had been punished.
   ``He said there are no cases of torture,'' according to the
report.
   Most of the complaints, 1,183 of them, came from Cubans who said
it was ``difficult to leave the country either temporarily or
permanently,'' according to the report.
   Cuba has said that under an agreement with the United States,
20,000 Cubans would be allowed to leave for the United States each
year.
   During the first nine months of last year only 5,932 had left,
and Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez was cited in the report
as blaming U.S. ``non-compliance with the agreement.''
   A considerable part of the report was devoted to statistics
suggesting a vast improvement in education and health care under
President Fidel Castro. It also quoted prominent cultural figures as
praising the government's literacy campaign and promotion of
cultural life.
   The U.N. team was headed by Ambassador Alioune Sene of Senegal
and included diplomats from Bulgaria, Ireland, Colombia, Nigeria and
The Philippines.
   The United States has charged that Cuba and North Korea are the
world's worst human rights offenders, and says the United Nations
should send investigators to Cuba once a year as it does with other
countries, including Chile, South Africa and El Salvado.
   The Cuban government, however, has said it will not allow another
visit.

   Despite being forced underground by an Iranian
death order, the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' is not in bad
spirits and is grateful for the support he has received _ especially
from Moslems, his friends say.
   The death toll from protests related to Salman Rushdie's book
increased to 17 today when police opened fire on protesting Moslems
in Bombay, India, killing at least 10.
   Seven other people have died in demonstrations in Pakistan and
India.
   In Iran, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran can't be
held responsible if a Moslem kills Rushdie, who was born into a
Moslem family. He also demanded that Western nations say whether
they agree with what ``The Satanic Verses'' says about Islam.
   Sources in Britain's Foreign Office said today Foreign Secretary
Geoffrey Howe sent a letter to his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, urging him to ``make clear that the Soviet Union
shares the ... wish to see Iran respect international obligations
and renounce the use of violence.''
   Shevardnadze, on a Middle East tour, has been granted a rare
audience with Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Khomeini told
Moslems to kill the British author. Some say his book insults Islam.
   Moslem clerics in Iran backed Khomeini's threat by offering up to
$5.2 million for the death of Rushdie.
   Indian news agencies reported anti-Rushdie protests in several
cities today.
   Police in Bombay said about 5,000 Moslems set fire to buses and
began attacking police officers. They said at least 10 people were
killed and 25 injured when police opened fire.
   The New York Times reported today that only Rushdie's sister,
literary agent and a few close friends know exactly where he is or
have spoken with him since he went underground.
   One friend, writer Tariq Ali, was quoted as telling the Times
that Rushdie ``is bearing up well, he is in relatively good spirits
and is very gratified at all the support that he has received.''
   He was quoted as saying Rushdie ``is also very aware that there
are many, many devout Muslims all over the world who do not agree
with Khomeini.''
   Ali was quoted as saying the novelist ``does not feel under great
strain or pressure ... but it is going to be very difficult for him
now. He will be constantly haunted by the specter of death.''
   Blake Morrison, literary editor of London's weekly newspaper The
Observer, said Thursday he had talked with Rushdie and the
41-year-old writer sounded ``all right.''
   In Canada, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark was put under
24-hour police guard, the Toronto Sun newspaper reported today. It
quoted aide Christian Sarrazin as saying the security was imposed as
a precaution after Canada withdrew its envoy from Tehran in protest
Tuesday.
   Another Canadian official, Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek, was
given police protection this week after receiving death threats for
refusing to ban imports of the novel.
   Police in Finland said today they had begun investigating a death
threat against Rushdie by Altaf Mohammed, vice-chairman of the
Finland-Pakistan Society.
   Mohammed told a leading newspaper, Uusi Suomi, on Thursday that
members of the society ``are prepared to kill Rushdie if he comes to
Finland.''
   In Norway, the governing Labor Party is considering whether to
expel Syed Bokhari, a Pakistani-born councilman in Skedsmo, for
saying in news interviews he would kill Rushdie if given the chance,
local party chairman Tor Erik Gulbrandsen said today.
   Detractors say the book insults Islam by portraying the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran
rather than receiving it from God.
   Rafsanjani, speaking at weekly prayers in Tehran, told Western
nations: ``Moslems believe that you are a partner in its
publication...If not, say so.'' Moslems want to know how Western
governments stand on the book so they know their ``duty,'' he said,
without elaborating.
   The Danish newspaper Weekendavisen today published excerpts of
``The Satanic Verses.'' The newspaper also reported that Denmark
planned to go ahead with a $100 million business deal with Tehran.
   The editors said in a commentary they printed the excerpts to
satisfy ``the public's right to form an opinion about the case, and
to show solidarity with the author and the publishers.''
   It said the state-run oil and natural gas company DONG and MD
Foods are about to tie up a deal in which Denmark would broker a
million tons of Iranian oil. In exchange, Iran would use the
proceeds to buy Danish cheese and other products.

<HEAD>ACLU Files Lawsuit Challenging Medicaid Abortion Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRETEL WIKLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit
challenging the state's new ban on Medicaid-funded abortions, saying
it punishes a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant after being
gang-raped.
   A hearing on the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Wayne County Circuit
Court, was scheduled today before Judge John Hausner.
   ``The law is imposing a double punishment on this person,'' said
Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the ACLU.
   The girl faces ``not only the punishment of being a victim of
rape itself, but being essentially consigned to the lifetime
consequences,'' Simon said.
   Hausner could issue a temporary restraining order and ultimately
a preliminary injunction clearing the way for a state-funded
abortion. The ACLU lawsuit, also filed on behalf of the girl's
mother, is the first to challenge the ban passed by voters last
November.
   According to the lawsuit, the girl, whose name is being withheld,
was raped last month by three men. The Wayne County prosecutor's
office said two men were in jail awaiting trial on second-degree
criminal sexual conduct charges in the case.
   The teen-ager, who is five weeks pregnant, wanted an abortion but
was unable to afford the procedure because her family is on welfare,
the lawsuit said.
   Elizabeth Gleicher and William H. Goodman, the lawyers
representing the girl, said the abortion ban should be overturned
because it denies poor women equal access to health care.
   Courts in Connecticut, Vermont, New Jersey and California have
overturned similar abortion bans, allowing poor women in those
states to again seek Medicaid-paid abortions, Gleicher said.
   Before Medicaid-funded abortions were banned in Michigan, the
state spent about $6 million a year for some 18,500 abortions for
poor women.

   A physician was ordered to surrender his
license and submit to a comprehensive psychiatric examination after
12 former female patients accused him of sexual and ethical
misconduct.
   In suspending Dr. Pravin D. Thakkar's medical license for 90
days, the Indiana Medical Licensing Board said Thursday that he
presented a ``clear and immediate danger to the public health and
safety'' and had engaged in ``immoral conduct.''
   Two women have filed lawsuits against Thakkar contending he got
them pregnant, then performed abortions without their knowledge.
Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger and Kathy Collins, both of Anderson, were
the first to testify at a three-hour hearing that led to the board's
action.
   Several women then came forward and said Thakkar asked to perform
pelvic exams on them despite their medical condition. One woman said
Thakkar wanted to perform a pelvic examination on her when she
sought help for a strep throat.
   Thakkar, 38, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has a family
practice in Frankton, did not attend the hearing.
   ``We know a lot of these allegations are lies and false. We'll
get a chance to present our evidence to the licensing board soon and
I'll be exonerated,'' Thakkar said in a telephone interview Thursday
night.
   The board pointed out that the 90-day suspension was the most
severe action that could be taken before a formal complaint is filed
and a final hearing is scheduled.
   Ms. Hertzinger claims she became pregnant with Thakkar's child in
February 1983 after they became romantically involved. Thakkar is
accused of administering drugs to Ms. Hertzinger eight months later,
causing her to deliver the fetus at his home. He told her the baby
was stillborn and he had taken care of it, Ms. Hertzinger said.
   However, Ms. Hertzinger claims that she was conscious during part
of the procedure and heard a baby's cry.
   Asked later if she regretted not coming forward with her
disclosures earlier, Ms. Hertzinger said, ``It took all the numbers
that we had here today to convince them of the severity and the
danger that Doctor Thakkar was causing.''
   Ms. Collins claims Thakkar fathered her unborn child and then
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument Jan. 9, 1988.
   After reviewing Thakkar's educational training and background,
board member Dr. Deanna Porte-Keene expressed concern over the
doctor's qualifications to practice as an obstetrician.
   ``I'd be interested to know how this doctor even advertises
himself as an obstetrician,'' she said. ``I'm certainly raising a
lot of questions as to what his qualifications are as a physician,
let alone his personal conduct, which is appalling.''
   Ms. Hertzinger and Ms. Collins have taped a segment of the
television talk show ``Geraldo'' that is scheduled to air March 7.
   A third woman, Susan Bickel, 34, a former employee of Thakkar's,
said she went to him for an examination in August 1982 when she
suspected she had become pregnant by her husband.
   She said Thakkar examined her with medical instruments and told
her she wasn't pregnant. She said she experienced pain during the
exam and later began bleeding.
   Mrs. Bickel said she went to another doctor who examined her and
told her she had undergone an abortion.
   Mrs. Bickel said Thakkar eventually told her ``that he thought if
I'd had a child by anyone else, I wouldn't want him.''
   Telling similar stories, almost all of the women testified that
Thakkar told them they were beautiful, asked questions about their
sex lives and asked them for dates while under his care.
   Dr. John Hinton called the allegations ``probably the worst abuse
of physician-patient trust that I've seen since I've been on the
board.''

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people held a rally in
southern Kosovo province today to support miners who are striking to
protest ethnic discrimination and to demand the resignation of a
Communist Party chief.
   Yugoslav leaders rushed to Pristina, the provincial capital, to
prevent possible ethnic clashes between the Albanian majority and
Slav minority.
   More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some on a hunger strike,
have refused to leave their pits at the Trepca lead and zinc mines
since Monday.
   Tens of thousands of people have joined sympathy rallies and
strikes across the province of Serbia, one of six Yugoslav
republics. Most private shops and some schools in Kosovo closed
today.
   About 3,000 university students and their professors today spent
a second night in a Pristina sports hall to show solidarity.
   Yugoslav Communist Party leader Stipe Suvar and the Serbian
republic's party boss, Slobodan Milosevic, arrived in Pristina and
met with Kosovo Communist Party chief Rahman Morina, whose
resignation the strikers demand.
   The miners consider Morina an ally of Milosevic, who is trying to
gain greater Serbian control over Kosovo.
   The mainly Moslem Albanians make up more than 85 percent of the
province's population, and they claim his move would result in
discrimination against them by Serbs, who are predominantly
Christian.
   Since the mine action began, 150 strikers have asked for medical
help and 16 have been hospitalized, the Tanjug news agency said.
   A provincial spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, today
denied reports published Thursday that 17 people had already been
hospitalized. He said a medical facility had been set up at the site.
   In Belgrade Thursday, the Serbian Parliament approved proposed
changes in the republic's constitution that would give Serbia
sovereignty over its provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, and increase
the republic's powers over defense and state security, Tanjug
reported.
   However, the ammendments must also be approved by the assemblies
of Kosovo and Vojvodina before they can be enforced.
   On Thursday, Yugoslav Raif Dizdarevic was quoted by Tanjug as
saying that constitutional changes would not ``endanger'' any
nationality in Yugoslavia.
   Dizdarevic met Thursday evening with representatives of the
striking miners and appealed to them to leave the pits and begin
talks with authorities over their demands.

   Increases today in the discount and prime lending
rates, which make borrowing more expensive, are a direct outcome of
the Federal Reserve's attempt to crack down on inflation, economists
say.
   The nation's central bank is trying to slow down the economy and
crush inflation by draining reserves from the banking system. That
has boosted short-term interest rates, although long-term rates have
risen relatively little.
   The Federal Reserve today raised its discount rate, which it
charges on loans to member banks, to 7 percent from 6.5 percent, its
highest level since April 1986.
   Major banks already had begun raising their prime rate, a
benchmark for a wide range of consumer and business loans, to 11.5
percent from 11 percent, effective today. That move was made in
response to the recent rise in short-term interest rates, which
increases the banks' own costs of borrowing.
   Chase Manhattan Bank and Republic National Bank of New York
announced the increases Thursday. Chemical Bank, Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co., Citibank and other major banks followed suit
today.
   The increase in the prime rate is more significant to businesses
and consumers because of its direct effect on loan rates such as
adjustable-rate mortgages. The discount rate is relatively little
used and the latest increase only partially catches it up with
increases in other rates.
   The prime is at its highest level since November 1984. In the
past year the rate has jumped 3 percentage points. The most recent
rise, to 11 percent from 10.5 percent, was on Feb. 10.
   Banks are passing along higher rates because their own cost of
funds has risen and demand for loans remains strong, said Alan Lenz,
director of trade and economics for the Chemical Manufacturers
Association.
   ``The prime rate is like any other price; it's set by both supply
and demand. They're going to get the best price they can,'' Lenz
said.
   Chase said it was reacting to rises in other rates, not
anticipating them, when it raised its prime rate.
   ``The prime's a laggard rate,'' said Fraser Seitel, a senior vice
president.
   On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices
rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, the highest in two
years.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called the inflation
trend disturbing and vowed to keep upward pressure on rates until
the pinch succeeds in squeezing inflation out of the economy.
   Since February 1988 the federal funds rate has jumped by more
than 3 percentage points. This rate, the interest on overnight loans
between banks, is closely controlled by the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed drained reserves from the banking system on Thursday,
seemingly indicating that it wants to keep the federal funds rate
somewhere between 9.5 percent and 9.75 percent, said Giulio Martini,
an economist at the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in
New York.
   Banks typically set their prime rate about 2 percentage points
above the federal funds rate, which would translate to a prime of
11.5 percent to 11.75 percent, Martini said.
   ``This is essentially a correctly placed prime,'' Martini said.
   Increases in rates have not slowed the economy much so far. One
reason is that long-term rates have not risen much because investors
have been confident of the Fed's determination to control inflation.
   Long-term rates edge up when investors begin to lose confidence
in the Fed and demand higher rates to compensate for expected
inflation.

insurgents formed for Afghanistan and predicted the Soviet-backed
rulers in Kabul will be overthrown.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who was recently elected president of the
interim government, also offered an amnesty for Afghanistan's
communist government troops if they switch sides in the 10-year-old
civil war.
   Fellow guerrilla fighters based in Iran today reportedly rejected
the interim government the insurgents hope will take over if
President Najib's communist government falls in Kabul.
   At a news conference ending a stormy three-week meeting of
Pakistan-based guerrillas, Mojaddidi said the guerrilla government
would become functional inside Afghanistan within a month, ``God
willing.''
   He asked foreign countries to recognize the proposed government
and for the United Nations to give it a General Assembly seat.
   The religious and political strains among the guerrillas were
evident when their council elected Mojaddidi, considered a moderate
among the Moslem guerrillas, as president and and Rasul Sayyaf, a
fundamentalist from the Ittehad-e-Islami guerrilla group, as
premier. Fundamentalist factions advocate a strict Moslem system,
and moderates have favored a broad-based government in Afghanistan
embracing Islam as its official religion.
   Afghan Shiite guerrillas, most of whom are in Iran, boycotted the
440-delegate council after the Pakistan-based guerrillas, the
majority of whom are Sunni Moslem, refused to give them the
representation they sought.
   Tehran radio reported today that leaders of the smaller
Iran-based resistance rejected the appointment of the interim
government, saying they were denied representation to the council.
   The radio quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for the
Iran-based alliance, as saying: ``We consider the formation of the
interim government as one sided, and cannot recognize it.'' The
report was monitored in Cyprus.
   The Shiites, Afghanistan's largest minority, represent only 17
percent of Afghanistan's population of 15 million but make up 40
percent of the 5 million refugees who have fled to Pakistan and Iran.
   Moslem guerrillas have fought the government in Kabul since the
communists seized power in a violent 1978 coup. Soviet forces
intervened in December 1979.
   Moscow withdrew its troops by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated
accord.
   Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted Kabul will fall
within months in the absence of Soviet forces, but Najib says his
army is strong enough to withstand a guerrilla assault.
   A Western diplomatic source, speaking in Islamabad on condition
he not be further identified, said: ``I think it's too early to talk
about recognition. Their first test will be to get a capital.''
   He said the first movement toward the world's acceptance of the
guerrilla government might be a ``de-recognition of Kabul.''
   Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing Red Army, hold
the capital and Afghanistan's key cities but insurgents, backed
mainly by Pakistan and the United States, reportedly control about
90 percent of the countryside.

   Oliver North suggested the Nicaraguan rebels
stage a ``suicide mission'' to destroy Soviet-made helicopters
before the Sandinista government could decimate the Contras, a
witness said today at the Iran-Contra trial.
   Robert W. Owen testified that in November 1984 he delivered from
North to Contra leader Adolfo Calero maps and photographs of the
Managua airport where the helicopters were being assembled.
   Before leaving Washington for Central America, Owen said, North
outlined his proposal for attacking the Soviet Hind helicopters,
which had been delivered to the airport outside Nicaragua's capital.
   Owen described the armor-clad Hind helicopter as ``the most
dangerous helicopter in the world.'' North was ``concerned if these
weapons, these platforms, were targeted against the Nicaraguan
resistance, it would decimate it,'' Owen said.
   The helicopter, used by the Soviets in Afghanistan, ``could put a
bullet in every square inch of a football field in 10 seconds,''
Owen said.
   North ``felt it would be in the best interests of the resistance
if they could stage an attack on the airport and destroy the
helicopters before they became operational,'' said Owen, the third
prosecution witness in the trial against North.
   North envisioned ``it would be a suicide mission undertaken by
the pilots'' who would not have enough fuel to return to their base,
Owen said.
   Owen, who is testifying under an immunity agreement with
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said he delivered the maps
and photographs to Calero during a trip he made to Honduras later
that month.
   North is accused of, among other things, lying to Congress when
he denied giving the rebels tactical military advice while Congress
banned any U.S. military assistance to the Contras.
   The ban took effect about a month before Owen said he delivered
the maps and photographs to Calero and outlined the mission as
proposed by North.
   Calero said he would discuss the proposal with rebel pilots but
``he didn't make a commitment one way or another,'' Owen recalled.
   Several months earlier, Owen, a former aide to then-Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind., now the vice president, said he discussed with North
a proposal to set up a non-profit tax-exempt foundation to raise
humanitarian assistance for the Contras after Congress shut off U.S.
aid.
   Owen said he and North discussed the fact that such an
organization couldn't be used ``to raise money for military goods.''
   North is also accused of conspiring to violate tax laws by
setting up a tax-exempt foundation to raise money to help arm the
rebels.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former National
Security Council aide, is charged with 12 felony counts arising from
his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   In testimony on Wednesday, Calero helped defense lawyers
establish that North's close working relationship with the Contras
was an open secret in official Washington despite the aid ban
imposed by Congress.
   Government officials, particularly at the CIA, constantly
referred the Contras to North, Calero said.
   ``If we had a request or some kind of a grievance, they would
say: `talk to Ollie.'''
   ``Everybody knew we dealt with him: in Congress, in the State
Department,'' Calero said. ``For us, he was the representative of
the United States government; he was our contact.''
   But Calero conceded to prosecutors that he couldn't recall
talking with Reagan about the kind of help North was lending the
Contras.
   Calero said he had franker discussions with the late CIA Director
William Casey, to whom he said he referred ``as Uncle Bill.''
   ``I was more explicit as to our situation and our problems with
Director Casey than I ever was with the president,'' the Contra
leader said.
   Calero testified he didn't expect that North would use any of the
$90,000 for personal expenses. But he said he never demanded an
accounting because ``I had absolute trust in what Colonel North was
doing.''
   He was asked by Sullivan if he ever complained to prosecutors
that North had ``misappropriated any of the travelers checks you
gave him.''
   ``Not at all, to any one,'' Calero replied. ``To this day, I
believe he acted properly.''
   Calero appeared to be a reluctant prosecution witness, repeatedly
telling Keker he couldn't recall a 1985 meeting in North's office
involving retired Army Gen. John Singlaub, who helped the Contras
buy $5 million worth of weapons, and arms dealer Richard V. Secord,
a retired Air Force major general.
   But under questioning by Sullivan, Calero had little difficulty
remembering details of meetings he and other Contra leaders had with
Reagan at the White House, which North had arranged.
   Sullivan showed the jury pictures of Calero and the other Contra
leaders posing with Reagan and then-national security adviser Robert
McFarlane.
   One picture of Reagan posing with Contra leaders was used by the
rebels as ``clear evidence of the support of the president of the
United States for the freedom fighters,'' Calero said.
   Another picture bore an inscription from Reagan to Calero that
said: ``Your struggle for justice and democracy in Nicaragua will
prevail.''
   ``Those were very heartfelt words,'' Calero said.

<TEXT>
   A dentist faces up to five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine for forging the signature of a man whose
mummified corpse was tended for nine years by his wife and children
in their home.
   Richard G. Kunce, 57, was convicted of forgery by a Knox County
jury Thrusday after two hours of deliberation. He was accused of
helping forge the name of Carl Stevens of Knoxville on a document
granting power of attorney to Stevens' widow, Carole, in 1984, five
years after Stevens' death at age 39.
   Knox County Judge Daniel J. Roberts released Kunce on a $55,000
bond and set no sentencing date. Kunce, who faces up to five years
in prison and a $10,000 fine, showed no emotion as he heard the
verdict.
   ``We intend to appeal. I am not very happy with the decision of
the jury,'' defense attorney John Pepmeyer said as Kunce stood
silently nearby. ``I feel he's anything but a criminal.''
   In closing arguments, Pepmeyer contended that Kunce ``was simply
trying to help Mrs. Stevens refinance a house'' when he helped forge
her husband's signature.
   But prosecutors said Kunce knew Stevens was dead and signed the
document with intent to defraud.
   The signature was accepted by a bank, which refinanced the
Stevens family home in rural Knoxville.
   Stevens, a diabetic, died after he joined a holistic group and
stopped taking insulin. Authorities say there were no signs of foul
play.
   Mrs. Stevens, 43, kept her husband's corpse in the family home
from his death May 12, 1979, until authorities discovered it Jan.
29, 1988.
   Kunce told the court that he committed no crime and gained
nothing when he tried to help Mrs. Stevens keep the home where she
and her two children _ Cindy, now 18, and Craig, now 16 _ had tended
the corpse.
   Mrs. Stevens, a registered nurse, pleaded guilty last March to
forgery and failure to report a death, and was sentenced to 12 days
in jail and placed on two years' probation.
   Kunce, who became a live-in guest at the Stevens home in 1986 and
described himself as a ``nutritional adviser'' to the family, was
acquitted of an additional felony charge of cruelty to the Stevens'
children.
   The defendant had been accused of teaching the teen-agers about
suicide, black magic and communication with the dead.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Mexico City police official under
indictment in the United States in connection with a car theft ring
has resigned, a police spokeswoman said today.
   Miguel Nazar Haro resigned late Thursday, said spokeswoman
Carmela Gutierrez. She did not give a reason for Nazar Haro's
resignation and said she didn't know if it had been accepted.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed Nazar Haro head of
Mexico City's police intelligence unit shortly after he took office
in December.
   Nazar Haro, 60, spent 20 years with Mexico's now-defunct
Directorate of Federal Security, the equivalent of the FBI. He
resigned on Jan. 13, 1982, when he was indicted in San Diego in
connection with the $8.4 million international car theft ring.
   The ring was smashed in 1981 by the FBI and California police.
   FBI agents arrested Nazar Haro in 1982 after he gave testimomy to
a federal grand jury investigating the case. He was released after
posting $200,000 cash on $1 million bail, and he fled to Mexico.
   In 1983, a U.S. district court judge threw out an $11 million
libel suit filed by Nazar Haro against Time magazine. A story in the
magazine alleged the U.S. government protected Nazar Haro from
prosecution as a car smuggler, saying he had been the CIA's most
important intelligence source in Mexico.
   Nazar Haro has said he cooperated with U.S. officials in criminal
matters but denied being a paid informant for the CIA.
   Mexican human rights activists, including Rosario Ibarra de
Piedra, leader of the Revolutionary Workers' Party, have alleged
Nazar Haro was responsible for disappearances and the torture of a
number of detainees when he served as the head of the Directorate of
Federal Security.
   Nazar Haro has denied the charges.

<HEAD>Couple Won't Seek Custody Of Girl They Believe Was Swapped At Birth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple who have claimed in lawsuits that a
10-year-old girl is the daughter they lost in a baby swap in a
hospital nursery now say they have decided not to seek custody of
her, a newspaper reported today.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg say they would settle for a chance to
visit with the Sarasota girl, and hope to incorporate her into some
sort of extended family so they could spend time with her while she
is growing up, The Tampa Tribune reported.
   ``We feel that we should not be denied the right to know that
girl as a child,'' Mrs. Twigg said.
   The Twiggs, of Langhorne, Pa., say statements by a lawyer in
their longstanding court battle suggesting they would seek custody
of Kimberly Mays were part of his strategy. They once considered it,
but later ruled it out.
   ``You take a step back and say, `what is in the best interest of
everybody involved?''' Mrs. Twigg told the Tribune.
   The Twiggs maintain they brought the wrong child home from Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula in 1978, and that Robert and Barbara
Mays took their child. The girls were the only white female infants
in the hospital at the time.
   The child the Twiggs raised, named Arlena, died of a congenital
heart defect last August. They learned from blood tests that she was
not their real daughter.
   Mays is fighting to block a genetic test the Twiggs want
performed to determine Kimberly's parentage.
   Mrs. Twigg told the Tribune on Thursday that she decided to talk
in part because of the growing public perception that she and her
husband are being unfair to Kimberly. The Twiggs say they have
received hate mail comparing them to terrorists.
   Their eldest daughter, Irisa, 20, was sneered at by a fellow
member of a health club, who learned her last name and said: ``Oh, I
know who you are.''
   Irisa said she wants to know if she and Kimberly are related.
``Maybe we could be friends one day, and sisters after that,'' she
said.
   Mays, a Sarasota roofing supply salesman, said in December that
Kimberly fears the Twiggs will remove her from the only home she
knows and that she inscribed a drawing she gave him for Christmas:
``I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.''
   Mrs. Twigg says the ill will since the case has been in the
limelight is undeserved. She said she and her husband first
considered seeking custody because they suspected Mays participated
in the alleged baby-swap, making him an unfit parent. They say they
changed their minds, in part because there was no evidence to
support that.
   Mays' first wife, Barbara, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried,
but was divorced.
   The Twiggs sued the hospital for $100 million. They dropped the
lawsuit late in 1988 on a technicality, saying they planned to
refile. They are seeking genetic testing of Kimberly in a separate
lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   The number of women appointed to state-level
cabinet positions by governors has increased more than 15 percent in
two years, the National Women's Political Caucus said today.
   The group released its study of governors' appointments and said
that since 1981, the number of women appointed to such posts has
increased 114 percent.
   ``Our new study confirms that the message of women's abilities
and political savvy is being heard by goverors of both parties and
in all regions of the country,'' said Irene Natividad, head of the
bipartisan women's political organization.
   The survey rated the 50 governors based on the percentage of
women appointed to their cabinets. Ranked first was Virginia's
Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles, whose 7 cabinet posts include three
women, or 43 percent.
   Ranked last was Missouri's Republican Gov. John H. Ashcroft, who
has no women in his cabinet.
   Natividad said Ashcroft ``is out of synch'' with the rest of the
states and has not recognized the political and leadership talents
of women.
   The group said 150 women hold the state jobs in 1989, up from 70
in 1981 and 130 in 1987.
   She said there appeared to be no difference between Republican
and Democratic governors in appointing women. Four of the top 10
governors in the group's rankings were Republicans.
   After Baliles, the governors with the most appointed women in
cabinet jobs were: Maryland Gov. William D. Schaefer, Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, Vermont Gov.
Madeleine Kunin, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, New Jersey Gov.
Thomas H. Kean, Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon, Louisiana Gov. Buddy
Roemer, and Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste. Tommy Thompson, James
Thompson, Kean and Bellmon are Republicans.

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese Shiite Moslem was
sentenced to life imprisonment today for the 1987 hijack of an Air
Afrique jetliner in which he killed a French passenger and seriously
wounded a flight attendant.
   Switzerland's highest court convicted Hussein Hariri on all seven
charges against him, including murder, attempted murder and
hostage-taking.
   The 22-year-old Hariri, who previously said a life sentence would
be ``no problem,'' rose from his chair but showed no emotion when
the verdict was read. He will be eligible for parole in 15 years.
   The ruling by the five-member Federal Criminal Court followed a
four-day trial in which the prosecution called Hariri a ``killer
blinded by conviction.''
   Defense attorneys had sought a conviction on the lesser charge of
manslaughter, claiming Hariri acted on reflex when he fatally shot
Xavier Beaulieu, 28. They said testimony did not disprove their
contention that the victim had made a threatening move.
   Hariri was also ordered to pay damages of $556,000 to Air Afrique
and a total of $101,000 to Beaulieu's family, the flight attendent
and a second passenger he threatened.
   Hariri commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 on a flight from
Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris on July 24, 1987, to press demands for
the release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by France, West
Germany and Israel.
   After gaining control of the plane over northern Italy, he
demanded to be flown to Beirut but agreed to a refueling stop at
Geneva airport. Hariri shot Beaulieu after his deadline for readying
the plane expired.
   Swiss police stormed the plane and arrested the lone hijacker
after crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing the
aircraft over safety chutes.
   Flight attendant Jean-Pierre Elouma was seriously injured by a
shot from Hariri's pistol when he jumped the hijacker.
   Investigators said Hariri boarded the plane at Bangui, Central
African Republic, carrying 140 rounds of ammunition and 19 ounces of
explosives.
   Hariri refused to testify in court about his alleged links to the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah group, Lebanon's most militant faction.
   Presiding judge Jean-Jacques Leu said Hariri told pre-trial
interrogators that he joined Hezbollah in 1985 after his release
from an Israeli prison.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most
of the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon, which include nine Americans.
   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Hariri had told interrogators he received detailed instructions
for his mission.
   Swiss officials said his demands during negotiations at Geneva
airport included the release of the Hamadi brothers, two Lebanese
arrested in West Germany as terror suspects.
   One of them, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, has been on trial in Frankfurt
since last July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a TWA
airliner to Beirut in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Hariri told the court he did not intend to kill Beaulieu but that
he fired without aiming when the Frenchman, his head covered with a
blanket, made a threatening move.
   ``I did not want to kill anyone, I only wanted to liberate my
friends,'' said Hariri, who described himself as a ``soldier of
God.''
   But the flight steward told the court he saw Hariri kill Beaulieu
with a close-range shot to the head.
   Hariri acknowledged he paid a bribe equivalent to about $6 to
elude police controls at the airport in Bangui, where his father
reportedly had a business.
   He was expected to be returned to the maximum security wing of
Geneva's Champ-Dollon jail after sentencing.
   The Hariri case gained wider dimensions with the kidnap of a
Swiss Red Cross delegate in Lebanon last November.
   Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber said the abduction was aimed
gaining leniency for Hariri. The delegate of the all-Swiss
International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Winkler, was
released after a month in the hands of captors who were never
identified. Switzerland said no concessions were made.

   An Irish soldier with the United Nations
peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon was killed today by
unprovoked gunfire from Israeli-allied militiamen, a U.N. spokesman
said.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in southern
Lebanon, said Pvt. Michael McNeela, 21, of Dundalk, was shot in the
chest by machine gun fire from a South Lebanon Army position
overlooking an Irish post in the village of Hadatta.
   ``Death was instantaneous,'' said Goksel. ``The fire was not
provoked.''
   Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of the U.N. force, visited the
village later in the day and told reporters: ``I condemn the
senseless killing of one of my soldiers.''
   Most members of the South Lebanon Army are Christians. Israel
trains and finances the militia, which helps 1,000 Israeli troops
patrol the Jewish state's self-designated ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon.
   Israel established the eight-to-10 mile zone in 1985 after
withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.
   Tension increased recently between the militia and the U.N.
force, and two Scandanavian soldiers were wounded earlier this month.
   The 5,800-member U.N. force, made up of contingents from nine
nations, was deployed in southern Lebanon in 1978 under a U.N.
peacekeeping mandate. Since then, 160 peacekeepers have been killed.
   Today's killing brought to 27 the number of Irish soldiers
killed. That nation's batallion has 700 troops.

<HEAD>China's Foreign Minister Warns Japan Not To Distort History</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hirohito Funeral, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's foreign minister, in town for the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito, met today with top Japanese leaders and told them
not to distort their nation's militaristic past, a government source
said.
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told parliament last
week it was unclear whether Japan had been an aggressor in World War
II and that historians would have to judge Japan's role.
   The comments drew criticism from China and other Asian countries,
which suffered a brutal occupation by Japan before and during the
war.
   Some of those nations continued their criticism today with
demonstrations and newspaper editorials.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China, meanwhile, met separately
with Takeshita and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno.
   During the meetings, Qian ``stressed that there are sensitive
topics between China and Japan and that it is necessary to come up
with the correct interpretation of past history,'' a senior Japanese
Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   ``No distortion should take place regarding the past because that
would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and should be
avoided,'' the official quoted Qian as telling Uno.
   Qian met Takeshita in a hastily arranged ``courtesy call,'' one
ministry official said. The two did not discuss the Japanese
leader's comments, according to a ministry summary of their talks.
   Uno told Qian that Takeshita's comments did not represent a
change in Japanese policy toward the war, and he expressed regret
that neighboring countries had ``misunderstood'' the prime
minister's intention, ministry officials said. Qian also was quoted
as saying that relations between Japan and China were in ``good
shape and progressing.''

<HEAD>Debate Storms Over Treatment Of 11-Year-Old Pregnant Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old pregnant girl was
transferred from one hospital to another with her legs taped
together to delay delivery, but both her premature twins died,
authorities said.
   The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services has
investigated the case and found that no laws were broken.
   But despite the finding, Duncan Moore, president and chief
executive officer at Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center,
said Thursday that he believed the treatment of the girl violated
state and federal laws.
   Officials at Tallahassee Community Hospital said doctors at their
hospital taped the girl's legs to protect her because she was not
willing or able to keep her legs together, as complications of her
pregnancy required.
   They then put her in an ambulance and sent her to Memorial, which
has more advanced facilities for neo-natal care.
   One of the girl's babies was born dead at 6 ounces and the other
died soon after birth at 9 ounces. The girl had been 21 to 24 weeks
pregnant.
   Community's administrator, Nick Carbone, accused Memorial
hospital officials of pulling ``a stunt'' to try to discredit his
hospital.
   ``This was absolutely the best medical thing you could do,'' said
Rheb Harbison, spokesman for Community Hospital. ``They're trying to
sensationalize this case.''
   But Community officials acknowledged that the girl should not
have been sent alone in the ambulance on Jan. 9 from their hospital
to Memorial, and said that a nurse will accompany any patients
transferred in the future.
   The two hospitals also disagreed on whether the girl was in
active labor when Community sent her to Memorial. Doctors at the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, a
physicians' peer-review organization, and officials at the federal
Health Care Financing Administration all found she was not, Harbison
said.
   ``But even if she had been, we still could have transferred her
if the benefits outweighed the risks,'' he said.
   Moore, however, said it was obvious that the girl had been in
labor.

   West Germany accounted for the most sales in 1988, 15 million,
followed by the United States with 14 million and France with 12
million, a U.N. news release said.
   UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, said it has sold more than 2.5
billion cards since the agency was founded in 1949, mostly through
volunteers.
   Artists such as Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Marc

UNICEF cards without asking copyright fees.
   The $40 million profit is about twice the amount it spends in
Bangladesh in two years, UNICEF said.

<HEAD>Taiwan, Trade To Be Among Top Issues During Bush Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``t'' issues _ Taiwan, Tibet, trade and
technology transfer _ are on the table when President Bush sips tea
with Chinese leaders this weekend.
   Bush's two-day visit to Beijing, starting Saturday, was to stress
the positive aspects of Sino-American relations that have developed
since the two nations established diplomatic ties 10 years ago.
   Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing for more than
a year in 1974-75, was to be given an effusive welcome as an old
friend of China.
   But the first bilateral summit since President Reagan visited in
1984 also offers both sides a chance to vent some touchy issues, and
discuss the quickly improving ties between China and its longtime
adversary, the Soviet Union.
   ``They'll be lightly skipping over a number of issues rather than
boring in on one issue,'' said one U.S. official, who spoke on
condition he not be named.
   Among the issues:
   _ Taiwan. Chinese leaders insist that Taiwan remains the most
serious problem in Sino-U.S. relations. Beijing says Washington
should play a more active role in bringing about a peaceful
reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, and condemns continued
U.S. arms sales to the Nationalist government on Taiwan, estimated
at $700 million in 1987.
   ``Some prominent Americans still cling to the hope of long-term
control of Taiwan as an `unsinkable aircraft carrier,''' Guo
Xiangzhi of the Taiwan Research Institute in the Academy of Social
Sciences wrote in a recent article.
   The United States has welcomed the lessening of tensions across
the Taiwan Straits in the past several years, particularly Taiwan's
decision to ease travel and trade restrictions with the mainland.
But it says the Taiwan question is one for the Chinese to solve
themselves.
   Taiwanese groups in the United States have urged Bush to back
self-determination for Taiwan when he meets Deng Xiaoping and other
Chinese leaders. The Taiwan government has expressed concern that
China will push Bush into a mediator role.
   _ Tibet. The United States supports Chinese claims to sovereignty
over Tibet, but has concerns over alleged human rights violations in
China's suppression of pro-independence disturbances in Tibet over
the past 18 months.
   China rejects criticisms of its human rights record, and says
U.S. congressional resolutions on Tibet are unwarranted interference
in its internal affairs.
   ``It is regrettable that a few people in the United States still
make unfair criticism on China's internal affairs, and even want
China's affairs to be done according to their will,'' China's U.S.
ambassador, Han Xu, said recently.
   _ Technology transfer. China is the only nation classified as
``friendly and non-allied'' by the U.S. export control system which
is also subject to national security and COCOM controls when
acquiring technology with potential military uses.
   Both the United States and the 16-nation COCOM, Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Control, which oversees exports to
communist states, have moved to reduce the list of items which must
be reviewed before being sold to China. But China, which badly needs
Western technology for its modernization drive, says liberalization
of exports has been too slow.
   ``This has not only inflicted losses on China but also tied the
hands of American enterprises and weakened their competitiveness in
the Chinese market,'' Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qichen said.
   The United States for several months last year froze further
liberalization of export restrictions in reaction to Chinese arms
sales to Iran.
   _ Trade. Bilateral trade soared to about $13.5 billion last year,
up from $10 billion in 1987, according to U.S. figures. But China
accuses the United States of protectionism, particularly against
Chinese textiles, and the United States complains about lack of
adequate protection for copyrights.
   The United States supports China's application to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but is urging China to first further
reform its trading system to make its goods more competitive and
less dependent on government subsidies.
   _ International issues. Bush said his visit is not meant to
upstage Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who comes to Beijing in May
for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   U.S. officials also say they welcome the normalization of
long-strained Sino-Soviet relations, which will allow both nations
to concentrate on economic reform. The Chinese say their improved
relations with the Soviets will not affect Sino-American ties.
   The United States and China both oppose Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia. Bush is likely to ask the Chinese to ensure that
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia will not lead to the
Khmer Rouge's return to power.
   Thirty-one U.S. Congress members asked Bush in a letter to urge
China to stop aiding the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge are blamed for
the deaths of 1 million of their countrymen during their bloody
1975-78 rule over the country.
   China has said it will cease aiding the Khmer Rouge when Vietnam
ends its 10-year military presence in Cambodia.
   Bush and the Chinese leaders are also likely to discuss tensions
on the Korean peninsula. China is close to the communist North and
the United States has troops in South Korea.
   The Middle East, Central America and the future of China's
market-oriented reforms as it tries to overcome economic overheating
and inflation also were expected to be dealt with.

   A nuclear device was detonated 1,200 feet
beneath the desert today in the second nuclear test announced this
year at the Nevada Test Site, the federal Energy Department said.
   The 8:15 a.m. test, which was weapons-related and code-named
Kawich, ``was very successful from all standpoints,'' department
spokesman Jim Boyer said. No ground motion was felt at a control
point 15 miles from ground zero.
   The device was buried beneath Yucca Flat, about 85 miles
northwest of Las Vegas. It carried an explosive force of less than
20 kilotons. Tests are generally announced as having a force of less
than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons.
   Kawich, the name of a ghost town in northern Nevada, was the
689th announced test since testing began in Nevada in January 1951.
   The test was conducted under the sponsorship of the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories. The last previous test was Texarkana on Feb.
10.
   A total of 12 tests were announced at the Nevada Test Site in
1988.

   Bank employees went on strike Friday
throughout Greece to press demands for a new collective agreement to
include salary raises linked to inflation.
   The 24-hour walkout at private and state-controlled banks was
called by the 50,000-member Greek Federation of Bank Employees after
the socialist government declined to discuss its demands.
   ``The walkout was a complete success. We haven't had such
participation in years,'' said union president Theocharis
Papamargaris.
   The union demands wage increases be linked to the inflation rate
on an employee's overall salary, which includes fringe benefits, and
not on their base pay. Inflation last year reached 14 percent.
   Average monthly wages for a bank employee are $335 in take-home
pay or $570 if benefits are included, Papamargaris said.
   The federation has threatened a two-day strike beginning March 2.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, once a champion
of ``trickle-down'' economics, spent the night in a housing project
as part of President Bush's mission to take ``inventory'' of the
nation's homeless and impoverished.
   Kemp toured housing alternatives for the poor and homeless today
and Thursday and slept at the Opportunity Towers, a federally
supported apartment complex for senior citizens and the handicapped.
   At the Bethesda-Brown homeless project today, which houses 44
people in North Philadelphia, Kemp called it ``a great experience to
be here and see how you rebuild lives.''
   ``My challenge is to use HUD as a catalyst to expand these
projects and encourage others to start them. Of course it takes
money and we will plan to get it,'' Kemp said. ``I plan to be an
advocate and I want to make a difference.''
   Robert M. Hayes, a lawyer for the Coalition for the Homeless who
accompanied the new housing secretary, said the group ``wanted Kemp
to see human faces. Ten minutes on a steam grate is worth 50 white
papers.''
   ``I hope this touches his heart,'' Hayes said, ``but in any
event, his political future will be linked with his success in
battling homelessness.''
   Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is
closely identified with conservative ``supply-side'' economic
theory, was accompanied on his tour by Pennsylvania's U.S. senators,
Republicans John Heinz and Arlen Specter.
   At the Women of Hope, a permanent shelter for impoverished women,
most of whom are mentally ill, the three listened as about 16
residents complained about the lack of affordable housing and jobs
for unskilled workers.
   ``While we sit here in this room tonight, many of our sisters and
brothers are out in the freezing cold,'' said Sister Mary Scullion,
the Roman Catholic nun who runs the Women of Hope.
   Philadelphia, the nation's fifth largest city, has a homeless
population estimated at 10,000.
   Sister Scullion told Kemp that more federal emphasis and money
are needed to lift the burden of the homeless from cities and to
provide more affordable housing for low-income citizens.
   ``We want you to go tour and to talk, but more importantly ...
the answer to helping is what happens when you go back to
Washington,'' she said.
   Kemp told reporters he had come to Philadelphia ``to talk with
folks and to listen, to learn about the problems, to see what
they've done and what I can do to be a catalyst, to make an impact,
make a difference in this problem.''
   ``It's a very human, real problem that exists and it's a national
tragedy, and George Bush wants me to not only inventory the problem
but inventory some of the answers,'' said Kemp, who plans to visit
other cities to examine their housing problems.
   Hayes, who is acting as a tour guide, called Kemp's visit ``a
non-ideological, novice's composite tour'' with as little time as
possible spent in offices with politicians.
   Kemp, Heinz and Specter stopped at a city-run shelter for
homeless men, where most of the approximately 75 men sitting in
plastic chairs seemed more concerned with getting a bed than talking
to political leaders.
   ``It's hard to get in here, man,'' said Nathaniel White, 42.
``They call your name once _ if you don't hear your name called,
forget it.''
   Earlier in the day, Kemp visited a soup kitchen and a homeless
shelter in Baltimore. At the Viva House shelter, he told residents
that he came as an advocate for their needs, not as an adversary.
   ``We want to make some changes,'' he said.
   Viva House Director Brendan Walsh told Kemp that programs for the
homeless suffered during the Reagan administration. ``So much money
has gone to the military that the federal housing budget has been
cut from $31 billion to $7 billion,'' Walsh said.
   ``That's why I'm here,'' Kemp answered. ``I want to find some
answers to the problem of homelessness.''
   Kemp planned to visit Dignity Housing, a North Philadelphia
shelter for homeless women and their children, and several other
housing alternatives, including a public housing project, before
leaving this afternoon.
   Kemp spent two days in Atlanta last week, visiting housing
projects, renewal programs, interim housing for the homeless, and
privately financed developments aimed at low- and moderate-income
families.

   When it suits his purposes, George Bush can be as
talkative as the next guy. The president simply turns a photo ``op''
into a press ``availability.''
   Reporters crowded around the president Friday evening, looking
for his reaction to the 11-9 Senate Armed Services Committee vote to
reject John Tower as secretary of defense.
   Bush acted undecided about whether he would answer their
questions.
   ``I've got to get a ruling on whether this is a _ this is not a
photo op,'' the president started out.
   He has declared that he won't entertain reporters' questions
during photo-taking sessions, dubbed ``photo ops'' by White House
aides.
   Then, standing in the evening dark by his limousine, its engine
running, aides Marlin Fitzwater and John Sununu at his side, Bush
decided he could indeed field a few questions.
   ``This is what we call a press availability,'' he declared.
   The president's availability lasted 10 minutes, dealing almost
exclusively with Tower's fate.

   ``I don't believe he is going down the drain,'' the president
declared.
   But it was the tubes, not the drain, that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Tower might or might not go down.
   ``I don't think it's a loss until it goes down the tubes on the
(Senate) floor,'' Baker told a television interviewer.
   He said he was in no position to predict the outcome: ``I'm over
here doing other things than politics ...''

   Tower was Topic A among the American contingent visiting Japan
for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   Bush and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., talked about
the Tower nomination by telephone, the president assuring the

Staff John Sununu was on the line to Tower after the vote, assuring
him Bush was still behind him, according to presidential spokesman

there, he arranged to see 19 presidents, kings and prime ministers
and one emperor, Akhito, son of Hirohito and 125th emperor in an
unbroken line of rule.
   Bush sat through a long funeral in bone-chilling weather, had
lunch with the president of France and dinner with the king of
Spain. And, of course, he had to keep up with the Tower matter.
   But was he tired?
   No, he insisted.
   ``I thought I'd be more tired,'' said the president in that
curbside Q-and-A session. ``I feel like a spring colt, ready to
charge.''
   And, while Bush posed for photographs before a quick meeting with
President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, a reporter called out, ``You
look tired, Mr. President.''
   Bush turned to Mobuto: ``They say you look tired, Mr. President.''
   Mobuto looked startled, not tired.

   Civil rights activist Julian Bond says
the fight for equal rights must rely on individuals working within
their communities and not on charismatic leaders.
   ``People must seize control of their lives,'' said Bond,
president of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. ``Today, we wait for others to
sanction our politics.''
   Bond's speech Thursday at Drake University, ``Sins Against the
People,'' was part of the observance of Black History Month.
   Today's black movement must regain the victories won by the civil
rights movement of the 1960s, Bond said.
   ``Despite gains, in a very real way in 1989, we find our
condition unchanged,'' Bond said.
   In 1986, he said, the wealth of the average white family was 12
times that of the average black family. In 1987, Bond added, 42
percent of racial minorities were living below the poverty level.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister has proposed a
series of austerity measures in return for a government pledge not
to cut the defense budget below the current level of about $2.65
billion a year.
   The proposals, including the withdrawal of 1,400 troops in West
Germany and restructuring of armed forces units, won't undermine
Belgium's commitment to NATO, said Defense Minister Guy Coeme.
   The ``structural reforms'' of armed forces units, such as
combining and scaling down some air force squadrons, closing a naval
base and a navy training school, and pulling 1,400 of Belgium's
27,000 troops back from West Germany, will be discussed with the
allies, he said.
   The number of troops to be withdrawn was low enough so as not to
be ``interpreted negatively'' by the allies, Coeme said.
   He said his proposals would save at least $51 million a year.
``The philosophy of our approach is that we will concentrate on our
traditional strong points like moine-sweeping and anti-tank
capabilities.''
   Coeme urged against further cuts in Belgium's annual defense
budget. It amounts to $2.65 billion this year.
   Belgium's defense efforts have long been a source of criticism.
According to alliance figures, Belgium spent 3.4 percent of its
gross national product on defense in 1980, which has since only
declined.

<HEAD>Governors Appointing More Women to State Cabinets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governors are appointing record numbers of
women to their state cabinets, more than doubling the total of eight
years ago, a women's political group said Friday.
   The National Women's Political Caucus called for the federal
government to follow suit.
   The group said its survey of the 50 states found 150 women in top
appointed posts, with gains for women coming in all regions and
among governors of both parties.
   It credited the governors with taking the lead in the appointment
of women and said in a report, ``Clearly this is an area in which
the federal government can learn a great deal from the states.''
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is the only woman heading one of the
Bush administration's 14 Cabinet departments.
   The number of women in state cabinet posts is up from 70 in 1981
and 130 in 1987, the group said. Women now hold 21 percent of all
state cabinet jobs nationwide.
   ``No doubt about it _ the nation's governors, with few exceptions
are recognizing that qualified, savvy and experienced women have
joined the poitical landscape,'' Irene Natividad, head of the
bipartisan women's political group, said at a news conference.
   But, she added, ``We look forward to the time when such studies
as this are no longer needed.''
   The survey, released a ppeared to be no difference between Republican
and Democratic governors in appointing women. Four of the top 10
governors in the group's rankings were Republicans.
   After Baliles, the governors with the most appointed women in
cabinet jobs were: William D. Schaefer of Maryland, Bill Clinton of
Arkansas, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, Madeleine Kunin of
Vermont, James R. Thompson of Illinois, Thomas H. Kean of New
Jersey, Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma, Buddy Roemer of Louisiana and
Richard F. Celeste of Ohio. Tommy Thompson, James Thompson, Kean and
Bellmon are Republicans. The others are Democrats.
   Noting the high ranking of several Southern governors, Natividad
said, ``I think we can safely say that the old stereotype that
Southern politicians are resistant to change has effectively been
broken.''
   She also said that while women first made gains by appointment to
administrative or health-related posts, they now are increasingly
being appointed to jobs formerly associated with men, including
those dealing with water, energy and natural resources, she said.
   Natividad suggested the group's survey, which it has released in
past years, with providing ``pressure by comparision'' on governors.
The study commended New Mexico Gov. Garey Carruthers, a Republican
with only one woman cabinet appointee in 1987, for recruiting two
additional women to his cabinet since then.

   No decison has been made on how to squeeze $2
billion out of farm programs to meet federal spending goals, but
analysts are looking at all possibilities, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Friday.
   ``We'll find a way to do so, because that's a requirement of the
(budget) process,'' Yeutter told reporters. ``Agriculture will have
to play its part in that process.''
   He added: ``We'll look everywhere, obviously ... it'll have to be
done on the basis of economic analysis. We're not going to do it in
an arbitrary or capricious way, and that means analyzing all the
options and combinations of options.''
   About $2 billion will have to be whittled from programs in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts were not specified in the
budget proposals submitted by the outgoing Reagan administration in
January and were left open to be negotiated with Congress.
   Yeutter served for 3{ years as U.S. trade representative in the
Reagan administration before President Bush tapped him to be
secretary of agriculture.
   No senior aides to Yeutter at the Agriculture Department have yet
been announced by the White House, and key jobs are still being
carried out by holdovers from the Reagan administration.
   However, Yeutter said at a news conference that he was hopeful an
announcement would be made soon on the No. 2 post of deputy
secretary, probably ``within the next few days.''
   Reports circulated last week that Yeutter and some presidential
aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job, with
Yeutter favoring Jack Parnell, the California agricultural
commissioner, or Sam Hollis, a cotton warehouseman from Memphis,
Tenn.
   But there were claims that White House pressure had developed for
former Kentucky governor Louie Nunn, who told The Associated Press
that he had been interviewed by Yeutter several weeks earlier.
   Yeutter said that the reports of his bickering with the White
House were ``completely false'' and that there had been no
disagreement whatsoever with the White House.
   Options for cutting USDA farm program spending include further
reductions in target prices for major crops, including wheat, corn
and cotton. Those are prices used in a formula to help determine
federal subsidies to farmers who participate in annual crop programs.

   An Israeli soldier was killed in the West Bank
city of Nablus today when Palestinians dropped a large cement block
on his head from a rooftop, military sources and Israel radio said.
   Troops clamped a curfew on Nablus' 120,000 residents and launched
house-to-house searches, Arab reports said. Residents heard sporadic
gunfire in the area, the reports said.
   Military sources said the cement block was dropped during a clash
in Nablus' open air market.
   Also today, nine Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in
the Gaza Strip, and a senior PLO official was quoted as saying he is
trying to arrange a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in London.
   Arab hospital officials said the Gaza Strip casualties included a
30-year-old woman from the Rafah refugee camp who is nine months
pregnant. Doctors said she was shot in the back but was not in
serious condition. They said a 4-year-old boy was wounded in the
right arm in the Maghazi refugee camp.
   An army spokeswoman said she was checking the reports.
   At least 385 Palestinians and 17 Israelis, including the soldier
killed today, have died in the 14-month Arab revolt against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Bassem Abu Sharif, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's political adviser,
was quoted as saying he hopes to meet Rabin in London.
   Rabin has left for a fund-raising tour in Switzerland and was
scheduled to go to London before returning to Israel next week, said
a Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He
declined to elaborate.
   ``I'm working through British political figures in the
Conservative Party to arrange a meeting with Rabin who will visit
London,'' Abu Sharif said in an interview in London with the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   ``If I meet him I will ask him `why do you shoot children?''' Abu
Sharif said. ``He will of course ask me `why are you rioting?' ''
   Rabin has met extensively with Palestinian officials in the
occupied lands. However, he has said he would not negotiate with the
PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.
   Abu Sharif said Israeli public opinion is important to the PLO
and could significantly influence the peace process.
   However, he said, mistrust is widespread on both sides.
   ``In the meantime, a majority of the Israelis don't believe the
Palestinians, but I must say that the situation is similar in the
Palestinian public with regard to the Israelis,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Recent polls have indicated that the majority of Israelis support
negotiations with the PLO under certain conditions.
   In other developments, the army has appointed a brigadier general
to investigate mysterious explosions that have killed three
Palestinian children and wounded at least 11 others in the northern
West Bank.
   Military officials have said the area, northeast of the city of
Nablus, is an air force training zone and that the explosives might
have been flares dropped during maneuvers.
   The most recent incident occurred Thursday when 19-year-old
shepherd was burned in the hands and face after handling an
unidentified object. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said Kassem
described the object as rectangular and shiny, similar to the flares
used by the air force.

   President Bush is meeting the four men who guide
modern China and its Communist Party during his two-day visit
starting Saturday.
   Two of them _ top leader Deng Xiaoping and President Yang
Shangkun _ are octogenarians, representatives of the old guard of
pre-liberation revolutionaries.
   The other two _ Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and
Premier Li Peng _ are younger leaders concerned less with ideology
and more with guiding China's 1 billion people toward a 21st century
of economic prosperity.
   Deng Xiaoping, 84, is the architect of China's bold experiments
in economic reform. He holds no official position except chairman of
the Central Military Commission, but no one questions Deng is the
man in charge.
   A former Red Army comissar who helped lead the Communists to
victory in 1949, Deng is a survivor of Mao Tse-tung's political wars
who has spent the past decade undoing much of Mao's ideological
heritage.
   Deng was purged during the leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution as
a ``capitalist roader,'' but battled his way back after Mao's death
in 1976. By the end of the 1970s he was China's undisputed leader.
   Deng rejected Mao's concept of the primacy of class struggle, and
made economic development his top priority. In the past decade he
has abolished the commune, revived the family farm and encouraged
private enterprise.
   He has also promoted the still-unfinished tasks of freeing
factory managers from bureaucratic interference, creating a price
system based on market forces rather than government dictum and
forging a well-trained, mobile labor force.
   Deng has tolerated slow expansion of intellectual and artistic
freedoms and has encouraged increased contacts with the outside
world, particularly the West. In 1979 he toured the United States to
mark the establishment of U.S.-China relations. But politically, his
instincts are conservative. Several times he has cracked down on
political dissent when he felt it threatened the supremacy of the
party or the nation's stability.
   Yang Shangkun, 81, became China's fourth president, or head of
state, in April last year.
   Yang, like Deng, was born in Sichuan province and played an
active role in Red Army campaigns of the 1930s and 1940s. Purged
during the Cultural Revolution, the career military man returned to
public office in the late 1970s and in 1982 was appointed permanent
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.
   As senior military officer on the commission, he backed Deng's
1985 decision to end the wartime footing of the army and cut 1
million troops from the force of more than 4 million.
   The post of president is largely ceremonial, and Yang is not
thought to be an initiator of policy. But he does have a voice
because of his close ties to Deng and his seat on the 17-member
party Politburo, China's top decision-making body.
   Zhao Ziyang, 69, for the past decade has been China's leading
advocate of speed and boldness in initiating economic reforms.
   He made his reputation as party secretary and governor of Sichuan
in the late 1970s, when he led the nation in highly successful
experiments in restoring family farming.
   In 1980 Deng brought him to Beijing, and he was quickly named
premier, a post he held until 1987.
   Zhao became acting general secretary of the Communist Party in
January 1987 following the ouster of fellow reformist Hu Yaobang,
who was blamed for pro-democracy student unrest. He officially took
over China's most powerful post the following November.
   Zhao, known for his immaculately tailored Western suits, his
cosmopolitan manner and his love for golf, has been widely regarded
as the man most likely to succeed Deng as China's senior leader.
   However, there have also been persistent reports, publicly denied
by Chinese officials, that Zhao's stature has suffered during
China's recent economic woes.
   Zhao reportedly has been criticized for pushing decentralization
and price reforms too quickly, contributing to the out-of-control
pace of industrial growth and inflation of more than 20 percent.
   Zhao now has joined the more cautious Premier Li Peng in backing
a two-year slowdown in reform while the government tries to restore
eocnomic growth to a manageable level.
   Li, 60, in April completes his first full year as premier, or
head of government. An electrical engineer who studied in the Soviet
Union in the 1950s, Li represents the new breed of technocrats now
filling the ranks of the Chinese government.
   Li has tried, with only limited sucess, to shake off the
impression that he is a conservative who opposes Zhao's efforts to
move quickly in introducing market-oriented reforms.
   He consistently supports the reforms, but with the qualifier that
they not be implemented at a speed that will threaten economic or
social stability.
   Li appeared to have gained the upper hand last September when the
government announced its two-year hold on reforms and said central
authorities would reimpose controls in such areas as banking and
foreign trade.
   Li, a native of Sichuan, was cared for by the late Premier Chou
En-lai after his father was killed by the Nationalists when Li was 3
years old. He joined the party at age 17.
   After returning from six years in the Soviet Union in 1954, he
held a number of important engineering posts, and was named minister
of power industry in 1979. He was appointed vice premier in 1983 and
served as education minister from 1985.
   Li, along with Zhao, is a member of the five-member Politburo
Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power within the party.

   They came to mourn Emperor Hirohito, but world
leaders used the gathering for a flurry of mini-summits on issues
ranging from Middle East peace and the furor over ``The Satanic
Verses'' to just getting acquainted.
   ``With Japan turning out to be the stage for funeral diplomacy,
the world's attention converged on Tokyo,'' the liberal-leaning
Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial, saying Japan should ``strive to
enhance our international trust.''
   The agreement between China and Indonesia to normalize relations,
suspended 22 years ago, was the biggest result of the Tokyo talks.
It came from a meeting Thursday between President Suharto of
Indonesia and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The long freeze
had resulted from Indonesian allegations that China backed a 1965
communist coup attempt against the Jakarta government.
   The Middle East figured in President Bush's meetings with
Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli
President Chaim Herzog and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   White House officials said Bush's meetings in Tokyo, most lasting
no more than 30 minutes, mainly were general discussions and were
not intended to delve into detail. But U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said ``there are perhaps some opportunities out there
with respect to the Middle East peace process that haven't existed
before.''
   Mubarak and Hussein, who had conferred at home with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Middle East peace efforts,
met in Tokyo. Spokesmen said they also agreed that recent diplomatic
efforts have brought the Middle East closer to peace.
   Mubarak conferred with Herzog, but they reportedly were unable to
reduce differences over a proposed international peace conference.
   There were delegations from 163 nations at Friday's funeral, and
the Soviets were among the first to arrive. They quickly took up
efforts to improve relations with Tokyo, which insists that any
substantial warming must await the return of a group of islands off
northern Japan occupied by the Soviets since the end of World War II.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe sought Japan's
support for his country's condemnation of Iran's death threat
against Salman Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Japan Foreign Minister
Sousuke Uno opposed any international leader advocating murder, but
said Japan had no plans to withdraw its ambassador in Iran.
   Howe dined Friday with the Chinese foreign minister for
discussions on Hong Kong, the British colony that is to return to
Chinese rule in 1997.
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita had meetings set with at
least three dozen foreign dignitaries, and an unscheduled talk
Friday with China's Qian, who also met with Uno.
   Foreign Ministry officials said that Qian and Uno discussed
Takeshita's remarks last week that it would be up to historians to
decide whether Japan was an aggressor in World War II. Qian did not
discuss the issue with Takeshita.
   ``No distortion should take place regarding the past because that
would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and should be
avoided,'' one official quoted Qian as telling Uno.
   Uno told Qian that Takeshita's real intention was misunderstood,
the officials said. After earlier protests in China, Japanese
officials said Japan was not trying to deny the suffering it had
inflicted on its neighbors.
   Bush met with Philippine President Corazon Aquino and assured her
of U.S. support and noted that his administration is asking Congress
for $200 million in aid for her country, White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Aid also figured in Takeshita's talks with Brazilian President
Jose Sarney. Foreign Ministry sources said Takeshita promised to
send a mission to Brazil to consider its request for new credits
that could total more than $1 billion.
   On Friday, Uno and Baker took up the U.S.-Japan agreement on
joint development of Japan's next fighter plane, which some American
congressmen say would mean transferring sophisticated U.S.
technology to potential competitors in Japan. Japan denies that.
   Bush also met Friday with King Baudouin of Belgium, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, West German President Richard
von Weizsaecker, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey, Italian President Francesco Cossiga
and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Bush had a private dinner
with King Juan Carlos of Spain.
   Fitzwater said Bush thanked Ms. Bhutto ``for Pakistan's
courageous efforts to help Afghanistan.''
   Ms. Bhutto also met with Mrs. Aquino, and they agreed to
cooperate in agriculture. Mrs. Aquino promised to help develop
Pakistan's industry.

   Nearly a week after the number for a $16
million lottery was picked, the winner of the multi-state contest's
largest jackpot is still unknown.
   The winning ticket for Lotto America's $16 million prize was sold
at a convenience store in the District of Columbia, but no one has
claimed the money, game spokesman Charles Strutt said Friday.
   The ticket was picked in a Feb. 18 drawing.
   This is the first time that anyone outside of Iowa or Kansas has
won the lottery game, which began about a year ago. The game's
previous record jackpot, $13.6 million, was claimed by a Norwalk,
Iowa, couple last December.
   The winner has one year from the date of the drawing to claim the
prize, Strutt said. If the $16 million remains unclaimed, it is
divided among the states in the Lotto America game, according to the
percentage of sales in each place for that jackpot, Strutt said.
   The other states in the Lotto America game are Missouri, Oregon,
West Virginia and Rhode Island.
   The winning numbers were 9, 17, 20, 28, 46 and 50.

<HEAD>Official Foresees New Rise In Environmental Cleanup Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of cleaning up radioactive and toxic
wastes at the government's 12-state nuclear weapons complex is
likely to exceed the official $63 billion estimate, a senior Energy
Department official told Congress on Friday.
   Raymond P. Berube, deputy assistant secretary for environment,
said a firm estimate for cleanup costs was not yet possible because
the department is uncertain how badly the environment has been
damaged at many of the weapons plants.
   ``There's a strong chance that these costs will go higher'' than
$63 billion, he said, adding that projected costs are likely to
escalate as more detailed information is learned about the extent of
the soil and groundwater contamination.
   ``There's a lot of uncertainty at this point,'' he told a House
Armed Services subcommittee.
   Berube said that while contamination at some sites could be
cleaned up in two or three years, work at the most polluted plants
``will require decades to complete.''
   He cited the Pinellas Plant, near Largo, Fla., which makes
electronic components for nuclear weapons, as a likely candidate for
speedy cleanup, in part because the vinyl chloride contamination
there is less far flung and is not radioactive.
   Among the most difficult cleanup jobs will be at the Hanford
Reservation, near Richland, Wash., which Berube said is the most
polluted site in the entire complex, and the Savannah River Plant,
near Aiken, S.C., which produces a highly radioactive gas. There has
been extensive contamination of soil and groundwater at these sites,
dating back to the early years of operation in the 1950s.
   Key elements of the weapons complex, including parts of Savannah
River, Hanford and the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in
Colorado, have been closed down by the Energy Department in recent
months because of safety and technical problems.
   An Energy Department report issued last month said it would cost
$52 billion to modernize the weapons complex, and another $29
billion to clean it up, over the next 21 years. The department has
said the cleanup cost eventually would range up to $63 billion, plus
another $2 billion to $4 billion for decommissioning and
decontaminating parts of the complex that are permanently shut down.
   An official of the General Accounting Office, the investigating
arm of Congress, reiterated the GAO's position that some of the
weapons plants are so badly polluted that they may never be cleaned
up. He did not specify these plants.
   ``In the final analysis, some areas within the complex may be
irreversibly contaminated,'' J. Dexter Peach, GAO's assistant
comptroller general, told the House panel. As a result, he said,
these sites may simply be sealed off and never used again.
   Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., said sealing off sites would
amount to creating ``national sacrifice zones,'' which he called
``utterly unacceptable.''
   Skaggs, whose district includes the Rocky Flats weapons plant,
called on the Energy Department to ``speed up dramatically'' its
efforts to identify all the contamination problems and to clean them
up.
   ``Our national defense and the future of the nuclear weapons
complex itself will be very much at risk if that full cleanup is not
undertaken,'' he said.
   Peach also criticized the Energy Department for having failed to
develop a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the nuclear waste
despite having been urged by the GAO to do so three years ago.
   ``Recent DOE plans and reports have shed considerable light on
the problems DOE faces; however, none of them taken individually or
collectively provide an overall comprehensive environmental
strategy,'' Peach said.
   Berube told the hearing that President Bush's designated energy
secretary, James D. Watkins, was intent on moving quickly to develop
a five-year action plan, based on currently available information,
for cleaning up and modernizing the weapons complex.

   Flutes wailed in a misty forest Friday as Japan
buried Emperor Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years through
militarism, ruin and the undreamed prosperity that sprang from it.
   Kings, leaders or representatives of 163 countries were present
to pay their respects, making the $74 million funeral of the
87-year-old emperor the largest international gathering in modern
history.
   Black-robed court musicians and attendants carrying shields,
pikes and banners of yellow and white preceded the emperor's coffin
to the mausoleum at Hachioji, 30 miles west of Tokyo, in the rites
that marked the end of an era.
   An official carried white shoes that tradition says the emperor
will wear to heaven. Hirohito was considered divine when he became
emperor, descended like his ancestors from the sun goddess, but he
renounced divinity after the crushing defeat of World War II.
   His coffin was placed on a cart, pulled 100 feet up a slope,
lowered into a stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed in with
concrete. By flickering torchlight in the evening mist, the imperial
family made offerings to his spirit.
   The newspaper Yomiuri said objects buried with the emperor
included the microscope he used in 50 years of research as a
respected marine biologist and a list of rankings of wrestlers in
the traditional sport of sumo, of which he was an avid fan. Palace
officials would not confirm the report.
   Kyodo news service said Hirohito was laid to rest in a white silk
kimono but that a Western suit and tie, his customary dress, were
buried with him.
   A 72-year-old farmer slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife in
an attempt at ritual suicide beside a war memorial on the southern
island of Kyushu, leaving a note that he wanted to follow his
emperor in death. He was reported in serious condition.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, one of two Japanese cities
on which atomic bombs were dropped, said the orations at Hirohito's
funeral ``sounded as if they were avoiding reality. The impression
was that he existed only after the war.''
   Nagasaki police said a letter containing a bullet and a death
threat was delivered to Motoshima on Wednesday after he said the
emperor bore some responsibility for World War II.
   A bomb exploded in an embankment about 20 minutes before the
funeral motorcade passed on its way to the burial ground, scattering
dirt on the road but injuring no one. It was the only violent
incident reported in a day of ceremonies guarded by 32,000 police
officers.
   Earlier in the day, 51 men in the court robes and headgear of
ancient Japan carried Hirohito's coffin on a bamboo-screened litter
to a funeral hall of unvarnished cypress wood in the Shinjuku
Imperial Gardens. Musicians played a dirge on pipes, flutes, drum
and gong.
   After several eulogies, President Bush and other foreign
dignitaries walked to the coffin and bowed slightly to pay final
respects.
   ``For the more than 60 years of your reign ... you shared in the
people's joys and sorrows,'' Emperor Akihito said in a farewell
address to his father, who died of cancer Jan. 7.
   Akihito, 55, was dressed in black tie, tails and a black silk top
hat. He marched in the procession in a near-freezing rain carrying
his own umbrella, as did Empress Michiko, 54; Crown Prince Naruhito,
29, and other members of the imperial family.
   During a 13-hour day of funeral rites, the foreign dignitaries
attended three hours of ceremonies in the gardens. They joined more
than 9,000 Japanese political and business leaders, artists and
athletes in two immense, heated white tents on either side of the
path to the funeral hall.
   Hiroshi Arakawa, spokesman for the National Police Agency, said
about 5,190 people were involved in 71 demonstrations across the
country against the imperial system and 12 people were arrested.
   He said said seven of the arrests were made in Tokyo, including
two people who broke through police lines and ran into a street on
the funeral route.
   Funeral organizers divided the Shinto and lay rites at the
Shinjuku gardens, drawing and reopening a black curtain between the
two parts, because of demands that the constitutional separation of
state and religion be upheld.
   Several members of the opposition Socialist Party skipped the
Shinto ceremony and attended only the part at which government
leaders expressed condolences.
   The Communist Party boycotted the entire funeral, contending the
religious and state-sponsored portions had been conducted as one.
The postwar constitution that specifies separation of religion and
state was written by the United States.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Hirohito ``ardently wished
for world peace and the well-being of the Japanese people, and he
always remained at one with them in the effort to overcome the
nation's difficulties.''
   Many stores, offices, factories and entertainment centers were
closed Friday, which was declared a national holiday, but trains to
ski resorts were reported full.
   ``We respect the emperor, but a holiday is a holiday,'' said
Hiroshi Hazama, 37. He said he watched early funeral rites on TV
before catching the train.

   A sheriff's deputy was arrested in the murder
of three prostitutes and is being investigated in the slayings of
six others who traded sex for drugs, police said today.
   A ballistics test has linked a gun found in the deputy's car to
at least three of the killings, police Chief Daryl Gates said.
   Deputy Rickey Ross, 40, a narcotics investigator who has been
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 18 years, was
spotted at 1:30 a.m. Thursday by police officers patrolling South
Central Los Angeles, Gates said.
   Ross had been driving with a woman in an area where several of
the women had been killed, Gates said.
   Ross was arrested by investigators who had accompanied him to his
home in the San Bernardino County city of Rialto, about 55 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   He was arrested for investigation of murdering three women, but
police were trying to determine whether Ross was linked to the other
recent slayings, Gates said.
   ``We have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only,''
Gates said.
   Gates said there is no indication the deputy is linked to any of
another series of prostitute killings that terrorized South Central
Los Angeles earlier this decade and became known colllectively as
the South Side slayings.
   The name of the woman in the car with Ross was not released.
Gates said she told officers that she was getting scared before they
arrived because she had been ``well briefed'' by police on the
area's killings.
   The woman told investigators ``simply that he (Ross) wanted to go
to the trunk of his vehicle,'' Gates said.
   The gun that was recovered was in the trunk, although the woman
didn't know that.
   At least nine women known in the streets as ``strawberries'' have
been shot to death since 1985. The body of the last victim was found
in November 1988. The same small-caliber handgun was used in all of
the killings, authorities said.
   This is the second string of murders committed in recent years in
the area south of downtown Los Angeles.
   As many as 18 women, mostly black prostitutes, were believed to
be slain in the Southside Slayer murders, committed from September
1983 to July 1986. One man has been convicted in one of those
deaths, and two other alleged assailants have been charged
separately in seven of the slayings.

<HEAD>Labor Leaders Call For Tougher Pension Protections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO leaders concluded their annual
winter meeting Friday with a call on Congress to make it tougher for
employers to skim assets from pension funds and a vow to be a major
force in the coming redrawing of congressional districts.
   The federation's Executive Council also condemned a recent
Treasury Department reversal of a Customs Service determination that
imported multi-purpose vehicles were small trucks and therefore
subject to a 25 percent import tariff.
   The protracted labor dispute at Eastern Airlines dominated the
weeklong meeting, with leaders of the 14.1-million-member federation
promising to back up 8,500 machinists and ground personnel planning
to strike the airline next week.
   But labor also put on the record its positions on a variety of
domestic and international issues with statements ranging from a
call for an increased minimum wage to condemnation of Iran's
Ayatollah Khomeini for his death threats against ``Satanic Verses''
author Salman Rushdie. Also included were resolutions supporting
labor movements in Poland, Hungary, Chile, Burma, South Africa,
Malaysia and Korea.
   The Friday resolution on pensions said nearly 2 million workers
have had their pensions jeopardized since 1980 by employers who use
overfunded pension money for business purposes, primarily to help
initiate or fight takeover attempts.
   ``Workers have a fundamental right to pension fund assets,'' the
35-member Executive Council said. ``Employers who terminate pension
plans to skim off `excess assets' violate that right and deprive
workers and retirees of their pension protection.'
   The statement called on Congress to take a number of steps to
discourage employers from dipping into or terminating pension funds,
including provisions calling for distribution of excess assets
between employers and plan beneficiaries.
   The post-election year session of the council was not as
political as past gatherings, but the resolution on redistricting
that will follow the 1990 census indicated labor would try to be a
major force in maintaining Democratic majorities in both the
Congress and the majority of state legislatures.
   ``It is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a
long-term reapportionment strategy that assists state legislative
candidates who are committed to programs that benefit working
Americans and counterbalances conservative, anti-union efforts to
gerrymander away liberal legislators,'' the council said.
   The resolution said the shape of redistricting would be affected
by those elected to key posts in 1989 and 1990 elections and urged
AFL-CIO affiliates to use their political action money and resources
to support Project 500 and the National Committee for an Effective
Congress, two liberal-oriented organizations involved in the debate
on how the redistricting should be carried out.
   The resolution condemning Treasury's decision in the
multi-purpose vehicle case was requested by Owen Bieber, president
of the United Auto Workers.
   The initial Customs ruling would have made U.S.-made
multi-purpose vehicles, predominantly smaller, four-wheel drive
vehicles, more attractive in terms of price than those of foreign
competitors, mainly Japanese auto makers.
   ``The Treasury Department has capitulated to foreign political
pressure, pointlessly increasing the U.S. trade deficit and
undermining the jobs of U.S. workers,'' the council said.
   The council called on President Bush to reinstate the Customs
decision.
   The panel said its decision to involve organized labor in the
debate over ``Satanic Verses'' stemmed from denial of free speech to
labor organizers in numerous countries.

   A prisoner infected with the AIDS virus was
granted a royal pardon Friday because he was ostracized after other
inmates learned of his illness.
   The pardon by King Olav V to prisoner Johannes Schwartzman
reversed the Justice Ministry's late 1988 rejection of the inmate's
plea for an early release, the national news agency NTB reported.
   ``I'd given up all hope when I received word of the pardon. I'd
like to forget these last few months in prison. It was a nightmare
that I wouldn't wish on anyone,'' said Schwartzman, 34.
   Word that Schwartzman had the AIDS virus spread quickly through
Ila Prison after guards were informed that he had tested positive in
August 1987.
   Inmates boycotted the prison church and wrote to the Justice
Ministry demanding Schwartzman's removal as a church officer. As
sexton, he handled bread and wine for communion and might accidently
spread the virus, prisoners said.
   The Justice Ministry rejected the demand but confirmed in a
letter posted in the prison that Schwartzman had the virus, which
his attorney said caused the inmate to be isolated.
   ``Leaking word of Schwartzman's infection was a breach of
professional secrecy by doctors,'' said Arne H. Husdal, chairman of
Pluss, Norway's AIDS victims lobby. He said he applauded the
decision and that it set an important precedent, according to the
report.
   Schwartzman, who is Dutch, had served three years of a seven year
sentence and will be expelled from Norway at once, according to the
Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang. His offense was not reported, and
neither prison nor Justice Ministry officials would say why he had
been jailed.
   The pardon was made on the recommendation of the Labor Party
government.

   A woman who testified she was sexually

   The 42-year-old woman said Dr. Karl Strelnick had sexual contact

   The woman's attorney, Daniel Rottier, said she was satisfied with

   Strelnick said Friday he would not comment on the verdict.
   He gave up his practice and voluntarily surrendered his license

   Emperor Hirohito, once considered a god,
was laid to rest Friday in a hillside forest with ancient ritual,
the music of pipes, drum and gong, and a pair of white shoes to
carry him to home to heaven.
   He was buried in a white silk kimono, but a Western suit and tie
_ his customary dress _ were entombed with him.
   Also buried with him were a microscope he used in 50 years of
research as a respected marine biologist and a list of rankings of
wrestlers in the traditional sport of sumo, which Hirohito followed
avidly, the newspaper Yomiuri reported. Palace officials would not
confirm the report.
   A heavily guarded procession carried Hirohito's coffin to the
mausoleum 30 miles west of Tokyo. Inside the gates of the Musashi
Imperial Cemetery, his son and successor Emperor Akihito led the
imperial family in burial ceremonies modeled on ancient Shinto rites.
   A 21-gun salute echoed through the green forest to herald the
procession's arrival. Court musicians playing pipes, flutes, drum
and gong led the funeral party up the gray graveled lane.
   Approaching the mausoleum, the hearse followed a group of
attendants in black or green robes carrying shields, pikes, banners
of yellow and white, and two of the evergreen sakaki trees held
sacred by the Shinto religion.
   An official carried the white shoes.
   Akihito, followed by Empress Michiko, led the funeral party to a
graveside funeral hall of golden Japanese cypress. A gray curtain
was drawn and the coffin was placed on a cart inside the hall.
   Members of the family withdrew to a nearby guest house, where
they spent three hours, and the coffin was pulled 100 feet up a
slope to the tomb.
   The rites were steeped in the ritual of Shinto, the indigenous
religion that preceded the introduction of Buddhism to Japan and
still coexists with it. In both faiths, care is taken to show
respect to the dead and ensure peaceful rest.
   Funeral ceremonies for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age 87,
lasted more than 13 hours; those for his father, Emperor Taisho, in
1927 lasted 1{ days and mourners dared not even look at the ox-drawn
hearse.
   Modern technology was used this time to speed the process: a
motorized hearse instead of an ox cart for the 30-mile trip from
Tokyo to the cemetery, floodlights to supplement the traditional
torches and three trucks loaded with pre-mixed concrete to seal the
coffin in the tomb.
   Offerings by court ritualists of clothing and 16 types of food,
including cakes of pounded rice, oranges, rice wine and melons,
ended the entombment well after dark.
   Akihito offered a sacred sakaki branch and made his final long,
deep bow. Michiko, also offering a sakaki branch, and other members
of the imperial family then paid their last respects, followed by
officials.
   Hirohito's mound-like stone mausoleum, which will be completed in
one year, sits in a quiet forest of towering cypress trees not far
from the graves of his parents, Emperor Taisho and Empress Teimei.

<HEAD>Young Says Bush Should Be More Supportive of South Africa Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said Friday that
President Bush should be more willing than former President Reagan
was to support the idea of U.N. sanctions against South Africa as a
way to end apartheid.
   Young, who like Bush once served as the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, said that experience should make Bush ``more
understanding and more appreciative of the powerful role that the
United Nations can play in bringing about an end to apartheid.''
   Young commented during an appearance on Worldnet, the United
States Information Agency's televison program in which foreign
journalists question American political figures via satellite
hookups.
   On another subject, Young, a former top aide to the late civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., was generally upbeat in his
assessment of the prospects for blacks under the Bush
administration. He said there is a ``tremendous difference'' between
Bush, who has worked with black leaders and the black community for
years, and Reagan, who ``really did not know what was going on in
the black community during most of his adult life.''
   Young also said the election of former Ku Klux Klan leader David
Duke to the Louisiana Legislature has helped Bush and Republican
Party officials in general realize that their party has leaned too
far to the right on race relations.
   Duke's election, he said, ``served as a warning to the Bush
administration and to the Republican Party that they have to make
some serious efforts not to continue to be branded in the minds of
most Americans as subtly and unconsciously, if not consciously,
racist.''
   As for South Africa, Young predicted that the United Nations'
role this year in supervising Namibia's peaceful transition to
independence from South Africa will help persuade the Bush
administration to support possible U.N. sanctions against South
Africa.
   ``When they see firsthand the effectiveness of the United Nations
in that kind of situation, I think we will probably see sometime
this summer the Bush administration willing to at least engage
Margaret Thatcher and Great Britain'' on the issue of U.N. sanctions
against South Africa, he said. The British prime minister has
opposed such sanctions.
   The United States did impose some economic sanctions against
South Africa during the Reagan administration, but critics said the
action did not go far enough.

<HEAD>GAO to Close Office in Panama Because of Unsettled Conditions There</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional agency which monitors U.S. aid
programs in Latin America plans to close its six-person office in
Panama because of unsettled conditions in that country, an official
said Friday.
   David Littleton, director of operations for national security and
international affairs at the General Accounting Office, said he
expects all personnel will have left the office by the middle of the
year.
   They will begin leaving shortly before presidential elections set
May 7, he said.
   The number of official U.S. personnel from various government
agencies in Panama has been scaled back considerably since 1987 when
relations between the two countries began to deteriorate.
   The Panama regional office of GAO, which opened in 1975, oversees
government-to-government aid programs for Central and South America
and the humanitarian aid program for the Nicaraguan Contras as well,
Littleton said.
   Littleton said in a telephone interview that the functions
carried out by the Panama office will be transferred to Washington.
   The United States does not recognize the legitimacy of the
Panamanian government and has not had substantive contact with
officials of that government since it assumed power a year ago.
   It continues to recognize as the legitimate authority in Panama
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was deposed last February
in a coup led by followers of defense chief Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   There have been numerous incidents of harassment directed against
Americans, particularly military personnel, for more than a year but
none has involved GAO officials, Littleton said.
   The military command headquarters said in a statement Wednesday
that in the first six weeks of this year, Panama's defense forces
have ``stopped, searched, rerouted, detained or impounded'' more
U.S. government vehicles than in the previous eight months.
   Littleton said the problems encountered by GAO officials have
been different. As an example, he said, the prohibition on contacts
with Panamanian officials has created difficulties in such areas as
renewal of visas and driver's licenses.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in congressional
testimony on Tuesday that he envisions no change from the Reagan
administration's policy of refusing to recognize the Noriega-led
government in Panama. He added, however, that the policy is being
reviewed.
   Noriega has been indicted by grand juries in Florida on charges
related to drug smuggling.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Says Interim Gov't Will Begin Operations Within

<TEXT>
   The president of an interim government
for Afghanistan said Friday his guerrilla-formed group would begin
operations inside that country within a month, and he added: ``God
willing.''
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi also asked foreign countries to recognize
the proposed government, which hopes to take over if the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul is overthrown.
   Other resistance leaders rejected the government elected by a
440-member group of Moslem guerrillas in Pakistan on Thursday.
   At a news conference concluding the stormy three-week session,
Mojaddidi said it would become functional inside Afghanistan within
a month, but he did not elaborate.
   Mojaddidi, leader of the guerrilla Afghan National Liberation
Front, also requested the United Nations give the interim government
a seat in the General Assembly.
   However, Mohammad Saljooque, a delegate and member of the
National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, said ``the whole thing
(assembly) was contrived'' to leave power in the hands of a
seven-party Islamic guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan.
   Eight Afghan guerrilla groups based in Iran boycotted the meeting
in a dispute with the Pakistan-based majority over allocation of
seats.
   ``We consider the formation of the interim government as
one-sided, and we cannot recognize it,'' the leader of the
Iran-based rebel alliance, Mohammad Karim Khalili, was quoted as
saying Friday by Tehran Radio.
   The guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed
government since it seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet
forces intervened in December 1979 and completed a nine-month
withdrawal Feb. 15.
   The guerrilla council, known as a shura, met at a religious camp
outside Islamabad to form a broad-based interim government that
would oversee a return to peace and the formation of an Islamic
government.
   Once the shura convened on Feb. 10, the seven Pakistan-based
parties quarreled over distribution of Cabinet ministries.
   The four fundamentalist groups favor a strict Moslem government
while the moderates advocate a more liberal regime with Islam as the
official religion.
   On Thursday, the shura approved a government that gives each of
the seven leaders a key post, and reserves most remaining portfolios
for their own parties.
   Mojaddidi on Friday repeated the guerrillas' offer of amnesty to
defecting Afghan communists.
   ``There is a general amnesty for (Kabul) regime members with the
blood of mujahedeen on their hands'' if they join the resistance,
Mojaddidi said through an interpreter.
   A Western diplomatic source in Islamabad said the rebels'
announcement of a Cabinet might not be enough for the world to
accept it as a new, legitimate government.
   ``I think it's too early to talk about recognition. Their first
test will be to get a capital,'' the source said, speaking on
condition he not be identified.
   Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing Red Army, hold
Kabul and Afghanistan's key cities. The insurgents, backed mainly by
Pakistan and the United States, reportedly control about 90 percent
of the countryside.
   Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted Kabul will fall
within weeks or months in the absence of Soviet forces but Marxist
President Najib says his army is strong enough to withstand a rebel
onslaught.
   Resistance leaders say they are adopting a harrassment and siege
tactic to save lives and await the communists' collapse from within.
   Of Afghanistan's pre-war population of 15 million, more than 1
million people have died and more than 5 million Afghans live as
refugees in Pakistan and Iran.

<HEAD>Writers Say Gorbachev Supports their Views</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Friday
with Ukrainian writers pressing for cultural, economic and
environmental reforms, and participants said he expressed support
for their efforts.
   Hours after Gorbachev left, police dragged away people who
gathered near a downtown square where rallies against the Ukrainian
Communist Party chief had been allowed nightly since Sunday, the eve
of Gorbachev's arrival.
   They hauled off anyone who stopped at October Revolution Square
and put them in vans. It was not clear what happened to those who
were detained.
   Dmitro Pavlychko, head of the newly formed Ukrainian Language
Society, which seeks to make Ukrainian the republic's official
language, said the group had a ``beautiful discussion'' with
Gorbachev in party leader Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky's office.
   ``He completely supports all of our national, economic and
ecological thoughts,'' Pavlychko said.
   Shcherbitsky is the only remaining member of the party's ruling
Politburo to have been appointed under Leonid Brezhnev, whose
18-year rule is now regarded as a period of stagnation and
corruption. There have been persistent reports since Gorbachev took
power four years ago that he has tried to oust Shcherbitsky.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' said only that Gorbachev
urged the writers to support his reform efforts.
   It said he also met with top Ukrainian government and party
officials as well as local party leaders before his departure for
Moscow. In what likely was criticism aimed at Shcherbitsky, the Tass
news agency said Gorbachev told the officials that in some cases,
the Communist Party still was avoiding involvement in reform efforts.
   ``It is necessary to raise the intellectual level of party work,
to free it from functions outside its purview,'' he said.
   Gorbachev did not directly criticize Shcherbitsky in the meeting,
said Ivan Drach, head of the Kiev branch of the Ukrainian Writers
Union.
   ``He had to be very gentle, very delicate,'' Drach said. ``He
tried to advance a line of understanding between the writers and the
party.''
   Drach himself called for Shcherbitsky's ouster during the
meeting, he said.
   Russian increasingly has become the language of commerce and
education since Shcherbitsky assumed leadership of the Ukraine in
1972. He replaced Petro Shelest, who was ousted on charges of
encouraging Ukrainian nationalism.
   According to Drach, the writers told Gorbachev they seek an
accounting of economic performance and problems, an end to massive
atomic power and industrial projects they say have devastated the
environment, a truthful history of the Ukraine, and a revival of the
Ukrainian language and culture.
   Drach also is the leader of the fledging Ukrainian Popular
Movement, patterned after the unofficial political organizations
that have drawn more than 100,000 members in the Baltic republics.
   ``We decided concrete things,'' Pavlychko said in an inteview
hours after the meeting with Gorbachev. He declined to elaborate.
   ``There was a palpable difference between Shcherbitsky and
Gorbachev,'' Drach said. ``We could sense from Gorbachev an aura of
good will.''
   Gorbachev told the writers ``he would do everthing to encourage
the Ukrainian language and culture'' and specifically supported
calls to make Ukrainian the official language, Drach said.
   During the meeting, Gorbachev won friends by quoting Taras
Shevchenko and other Ukrainian poets, Pavlychko said.
   He also asked writers for patience, ``to understand the
complexities of the entire situation,'' Pavlychko said. ``We
shouldn't whip our horses,'' he quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``It is important that for the first time, the writers were in
the office of Shcherbitsky,'' Drach said. ``We had to wait for the
visit of Gorbachev to get it.''

   Sixty Chinese ``war orphans'' on Friday began their
search for their real Japanese families who fled China without them
at the end of World War II.
   The 27 men and 33 women arrived in Japan at the start of a 15-day
search for kin. Officials from the Health and Welfare Ministry were
on hand to greet the group at Narita Airport outside Tokyo.
   Since 1981, more than 1,600 Japanese raised by Chinese foster
parents have visited Japan under a government program, and about 570
of them have been reunited with their Japanese relatives.
   The majority were infants when they were left behind by their
families, settlers in northern China, at the end of the war.
   Under a 1988 Japan-China agreement, 100 orphans are scheduled to
visit Japan this year, with all costs covered by the Japanese
government.

<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. will be the
chief of a new non-profit organization devoted to increasing
government funding for medical research.
   The Connecticut Republican, who lost his bid for a fourth Senate
term in November, will become president and chief executive officer
of Research! America, which will open its doors in Alexandria, Va.,
this spring, publicist Jane Miller said Thursday.
   Weicker would not discuss details of the new organization.
   Terry Lierman, a Washington lobbyist who founded the group, said
the organization plans to spend about $3 million a year on an
education campaign that will feature Weicker speaking around the
country.
   Weicker was a leader for medical research, especially for AIDS
and the handicapped, throughout his Capitol Hill career. One of his
sons, Sonny, suffers from Down's syndrome.
   ``He was Mr. Research in the United States Senate, so he brings a
tremendous amount of prestige and credit to the organization
immediately,'' said Lierman, president of Capitol Associates Inc.
   Lierman said Research! America will act as an umbrella group for
a wide range of academic, fund-raising, industry and research
groups, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation, American Association of Universities, American
Association of Medical Colleges and Upjohn Co.

<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old boy was sent to the Nebraska
State Penitentiary because he's a smart youngster who wants to be a
criminal when he grows up, the judge who sentenced the youth said
Friday. The youngster is the youngest person ever held at the prison.
   Buffalo County Judge DeWayne Wolf decided Thursday to send
Richard Boswell to the penitentiary after he was convicted as an
adult of auto theft and of escaping from a state institution.
   ``I feel very vacant,'' Wolf said in a telephone interview.
   ``I sat and stared at this kid. He's a smart person. He knows
what he wants, and, unfortunately, what he apparently wants is to be
a criminal,'' he said.
   Public Defender Gary Hogg, who represented Boswell, said the
judge's only choices were to send Boswell to the Youth Development
Center in Kearney, from which the boy escaped at least twice, or the
state penitentiary. The state does not have a maximum-security
facility for juvenile offenders.
   ``This is no normal kid,'' Wolf said. ``He's 14, but he's not the
average kid from your neighborhood. He's a very dangerous young
man.''
   Wolf sent Boswell to the center in central Nebraska Dec. 19 after
the boy was convicted of escaping from the institution.
   ``I gave him a lecture at that time, that he's too young to go to
the penitentiary, and all that stuff,'' Wolf said.
   The next day, Boswell ran away from the center, which has no
fences.
   After that escape, Wolf and Hogg said, Boswell broke into some
cars and stole a knife, a gun and a set of brass knuckles.
   The officer sent to arrest Boswell in a garage asked for help,
fearing for his safety, Wolf said, adding that Boswell was later
overheard to say that he would have shot the officer if he had come
into the garage.
   Boswell was sentenced to up to three years for escape and one to
four years for auto theft. Wolf said Boswell should be eligible for
parole in about nine months.
   Assistant Corrections Director Larry Tewes said Boswell was held
in a hospital room at the prison.
   ``We could keep him there until he's 16 if we had to, but we'd
rather not. We'll be looking to transfer him to another state which
can handle juvenile offenders,'' said Tewes, who added that Boswell
is the youngest person ever held at the prison.
   Boswell was first sent to the youth center in November 1987 for
robbery, assault and burglary.
   ``The sad part of this real issue is what do you do with the
young criminal,'' Wolf said. ``We have only two choices, YDC or
corrections. We really don't have a secure facility. We need one.''
   State Sen. Jerry Chizek, chairman of the Legislature's Judiciary
Committee, agreed.
   ``We have to recognize that there are juveniles who are real
problems, and we must deal with that,'' he said. ``We don't have an
answer right now, but I do know that sending a 14-year-old to prison
is definitely not going to correct the problem.''
   The problem, Wolf said, stems from the changing nature of
juvenile offenders.
   ``Twenty years ago they were runaways. Today they are doing the
same things as adult criminals,'' Wolf said.
   ``Our failure with this particular youth was some time ago,
probably before he was 8. This just didn't happen overnight,'' he
said.

   A judge on Friday sentenced two men to six
years probation and 1,200 hours community service for stealing
donated eye tissues and selling them abroad.
   Hillsborough Circuit Judge Dennis Alvarez also fined each man
$4,500 to cover restitution and court costs, but said Robert Grant
and Robert Fisher will have a clean record if they successfully
complete probation.
   Grant and Fisher were convicted last month of conspiracy and
grand theft by a jury that acquitted their wives, Gailya Grant and
Irene Fisher.
   They could have been sent to prison for one year on the
conspiracy charge and five on the grand theft count.
   Prosecutors accused them of misrepresenting themselves as members
of a non-profit eye bank in order to gain access to cadavers in
medical examiners' offices, hospitals and funeral homes.
   Grant, 45, and Fisher, 40, sent corneas taken from the corpses to
research facilities in the United States and abroad to Argentina and
Saudia Arabia, authorities said. Many went to a Saudi Arabian
hospital for a processing fee as high as $1,300 a pair, Assistant
Hillsborough State Attorney Judy Hoyer said during trial.
   Medical examiners supplying the corneas _ the transparent tissues
that cover and protect the eyeball _ assumed the tissues were going
to Florida Regional Bone and Tissue Bank Inc., but they were sold by
another eye bank, University Ophthalmic Services Inc.
   Grant and Fisher were former employees of Florida Regional.
   Ms. Hoyer said University Ophthalmic was set up in 1986 by Mrs.
Grant and Mrs. Fisher.
   It was closed a year later after Florida Regional discovered
Grant and Fisher were removing corneas and keeping the fees for
delivering them.
   Defense attorneys maintained their clients simply recognized a
loophole in the law, set up a legitimate eye bank, retrieved corneas
that likely would have been discarded, and capitalized on the need
for eye tissue in foreign countries.

   A black foster mother saw her dream go up in
flames when a cross was burned in her front yard and fire later
gutted her house in an all-white neighborhood.
   Mae Lester, 27, said it's difficult for her to trust any whites
after the fires earlier this month.
   ``You cut my heart out and burn it up, knowing you can't live
where you want to live,'' she said.
   But Crisp County Sheriff Donnie Haralson said the burning of Ms.
Lester's house isn't indicative of the community's racial climate.
   ``The majority of Crisp County residents don't condone'' what
happened to Ms. Lester, the sheriff said.
   Ms. Lester had moved into the house in a subdivision just north
of Cordele Feb. 12, having signed a $315-a-month lease with an
option to buy at $28,000. She receives about $1,100 a month in state
assistance for caring for five foster children. She has one child of
her own.
   But before she could spend a night in her dream house, someone
burned an 8-foot-high cross on the lawn.
   ``The cross meant they were going to burn me down,'' Ms. Lester
said. So, she repacked and moved in with her sister.
   Two days later, authorities said, fire gutted the house.
   No arrests have been made.
   Jack White, special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation's regional office in Perry, said Friday that
authorities did not believe the Ku Klux Klan was involved.
   ``We're looking at some individuals,'' White said, declining to
comment on whether any were residents of the subdivision.
   ``There's been nothing to suggest'' that the Klan was involved
``other than the fact that a wooden cross was burned,'' he said.
   James Harris, a vice president of the Crisp County NAACP chapter,
said the organization has not become involved in the incident and is
awaiting the outcome of the investigation.
   ``This is the first incident of this nature in several years,''
he said. ``That's what's so upsetting about it.''
   Jimmy Amerson, 31, and his wife and 9-year-old son live across
the street from Ms. Lester's former house. His fence company, he
said, does business with blacks and he doesn't object to blacks
living in the neighborhood.
   ``I don't care where they live, but I don't want to eat with
them,'' Amerson said.
   H.M. Turton Jr., who leased the house to Ms. Lester, declined to
discuss the fire. Ms. Lester is leasing another house from Turton in
a mixed neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   The nation's elderly are being ``needlessly and
inhumanely'' drugged by doctors who are inexperienced in treating
older patients and who rely on drugs to control behavior, the
American Psychological Association said Friday.
   Many of these patients could benefit from lower doses of the
medications they need to treat chronic illnesses and from
alternative, nondrug therapies such as psychological counseling, the
association said in asking Medicare to cover their services.
   Too often the elderly are ``needlessly and inhumanely being left
and psychologically abandoned to drug-induced stupors,'' said Bryant
Welch, executive director of professional practice at the
association.
   He spoke to reporters at a briefing in advance of a forum
sponsored by the association's board of professional affairs on the
overuse and misuse of prescription drugs for the elderly.
   A report earlier this month by the inspector general's office at
the Department of Health and Human Services alleged widespread
prescription drug problems among the elderly. The report said
Americans over age 60 account for 51 percent of deaths and 39
percent of hospitalizations from drug reactions.
   The psychologists' association concentrated on the misprescribing
of psychotropic drugs _ medications that control behavior _ to older
patients.
   ``Antipsychotic drugs must be used appropriately, for specific
documentable reasons, not simply to control behavior, perhaps more
for staff convenience'' at nursing homes, said William Simonson,
associate professor of pharmacy at Oregon State University, who
joined Welch at the briefing.
   ``The tragic scenario of a physically robust patient turning into
a nonfunctional zombie after receiving antipsychotics has been
played out many times,'' he said.
   The problem may be eased, he said, by Medicare regulations due to
go into effect later this year. The rules will require nursing homes
to ensure that residents are not given antipsychotic drugs unless
needed to treat a specific condition and that residents who use the
drugs be given gradual dose reductions or drug ``holidays'' when
possible in an effort to discontinue use.
   Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the American Health Care
Association, which represents more than 8,000 nursing homes, noted
that ``government standards for care currently discourage the use of
drug therapy to control behavior.''
   She added, ``While we recognize that psychotropic drugs have been
used in the past as chemical restraints, physicians prescribing
drugs to nursing home patients increasingly realize that such
practices may help control behavior but they inevitably create new
problems.''
   From 35 percent to 40 percent of prescribed sedatives and
hypnotic drugs go to elderly Americans, who make up about 12 percent
of the population, the psychologists' group said.
   The American Psychiatristric Association agrees that physicians
need more training about prescribing psychotropic drugs for the
elderly. The association started such a program two years ago, said
spokesman Dr. Harvey Ruben.
   However, Ruben said it is ``naive'' for the psychologists to
believe that many nursing home patients could be treated with
alternative, nonmedical therapies. He said 60 percent to 70 percent
of nursing home patients have some form of dementia and most would
not benefit from behavior modification.
   The psychologists recommend that the Medicare program, the
federal health insurance program for the elderly, be expanded to
cover psychological services.
   Currently, the program's mental health coverage includes services
by psychiatrists, who can prescribe drugs. The services of
psychologists, who are not medical doctors and cannot prescribe
drugs, are not covered by Medicare.
   Simonson, who specializes in geriatric pharmacology, said
medications to control behavior can be used effectively to manage
patients, and in nursing homes there is often pressure to use these
drugs to control patients prone to wandering around, yelling or
striking out at other patients.

   A veteran sheriff's deputy who allegedly was
smoking cocaine with a prostitute was arrested for investigation of
murdering three hookers in an area where at least nine prostitutes
have been killed, police said Friday.
   Rickey Ross, 40, a narcotics investigator who has been with the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 18 years, was spotted
with the woman in his car early Thursday by police officers
patrolling south-central Los Angeles, Police Chief Daryl Gates said
at a news conference.
   Police have been investigating the slayings in the area of at
least nine and possibly as many as a dozen ``strawberries,'' women
who trade sex for drugs, since August 1985.
   Police were investigating whether Ross was linked to the other
recent slayings, Gates said. But he said there was no indication the
deputy was linked to any of another series of prostitute killings in
the area earlier this decade that became known collectively as the
South Side slayings.
   Ross was arrested after a gun found in his car was linked by a
ballistics test to the three killings, police said.
   Gates said the woman in the car did not know Ross was a deputy.
   ``He did not stop her using his badge,'' Gates said. ``He only
identified himself (as a deputy) after the officers stopped him.''
   The name of the woman in the car with Ross was not released.
Gates said officers determined that she was a prostitute, but he
would not characterize her as a ``strawberry.''
   Gates said she told officers that she was getting scared before
the officers stopped them because she had been ``well briefed'' by
police on the killings.
   The woman told investigators ``simply that he (Ross) wanted to go
to the trunk of his vehicle,'' Gates said. The gun was found in the
trunk. The gun was not described but Gates said it was not the
deputy's service weapon.
   Gates said Ross waived his rights and spoke to investigators, but
the chief would only reveal a little bit of what was said.
   ``He was not able to explain all of this,'' Gates said. ``He
admitted he picked up the young woman but he did not believe she was
a prostitute.''
   Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said Ross, married with
two children ages 20 and 5, had been assigned to a unit at Los
Angeles International Airport.
   ``He has a very fine record,'' Block said. ``He has been a very
effective investigator in the narcotics bureau.''
   Police on routine patrol spotted Ross' car parked, but said it
pulled away from the curb in an ``erratic'' manner when they
approached and the officers made a traffic stop, the chief said.
   The officers believed Ross was under the influence of an
intoxicating substance. Gates said the woman told investigators they
had been smoking cocaine, but he noted that tests were still being
conducted to confirm the type of substance.
   Ross was initially held for driving under the influence. After
the ballistics report on the three killings was finished, he was
arrested in his home in Rialto, about 55 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles.
   A search warrant was obtained and the home was searched but Gates
would not reveal what was recovered there.
   ``We have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only,''
Gates said. Those three victims were found on Oct. 14, Nov. 18 and
Dec. 11.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Says Europe 1992 Should Be Good for U.S. Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Friday
that Western Europe's plan to create a unified economy by 1992 is
expected to expand markets for U.S. companies rather than create a
``fortress Europe'' that shuns American goods.
   Mosbacher, in his first major address since joining the Cabinet,
said that while there are sure to be a few European ``strongholds''
against U.S. goods, the initiative generally is likely to improve
business opportunities for Americans.
   The 12 countries in the European Economic Community are trying to
forge a single market, almost as integrated as the United States, by
the end of 1992.
   ``In a sense, 1992 marks a shift in majority view away from
protection and toward openness _ a willingness to gamble that this
openness will work,'' Mosbacher said at a congressionally sponsored
conference on Europe 1992.
   He said government analysts and business executives also are
concerned that some benefits of the unified market may be denied to
non-EEC countries, but the full impact of the initiative won't be
known until the plan actually is implemented.
   ``The reality is that many Europeans are not completely in favor
of more open markets,'' Mosbacher said. ``Some European companies
have been accustomed to having their inefficiency shielded by their
governments.''
   Mosbacher said that while free-trade advocates cannot expect to
win every dispute, U.S. officials will work to eliminate any
inequities.
   ``All of us in the administration will forcefully advocate vital
U.S. business interests through regular meetings with our EC
counterparts,'' he said.
   Speaking about efforts to shrink the U.S. trade deficit,
Mosbacher said he had a message for countries that think they can
continue to sell to the United States while refusing to buy American
products: ``Those days are over.''
   ``An open America is best for us and for the world,'' he said.
``But the world must be open to America as well.''
   In addition, Mosbacher said, American industry must redouble its
investment, research and pursuit of quality in order to better
compete with foreign producers.
   ``American industry must learn to do what others do, and pull out
all stops to win and hold foreign customers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldier Killed, Nine Palestinians Reported Wounded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli reserve soldier was killed in the
West Bank on Friday when Palestinians dropped a cement block on his
head from the roof of a building, the army said.
   The soldier, identified as Binyamin Meisner, 24, was the sixth
member of Israel's armed forces to be killed since the uprising
began in December 1987. A total of 17 Israelis and at least 385
Palestinians have been killed.
   Israel radio and television said Palestinians provoked soldiers
by throwing stones and lured them into one of the narrow alleys of
the city's open air market.
   The large block was then dropped and hit Meisner, who was wearing
a steel helmet. After Meisner was hit, troops opened fire, said a
Nablus army commander who was not identified further.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus' 120,000 residents and began
house-to-house searches, and sporadic gunfire was heard, Arab
reports said.
   In the Gaza Strip, nine Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking
the reports.
   The hospital officials said the wounded included a 30-year-old
woman who was nine months pregnant. Doctors said she was shot in the
back but was not in serious condition. They said a 4-year-old boy
was shot in the right arm.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's political adviser,
said in an interview published Friday he was trying to arrange a
meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in London.
   Abu Sharif, speaking in an interview with the Israeli newspaper
Yediot Ahronot in London, said he was ``working through British
political figures in the Conservative Party to arrange a meeting
with Rabin who will visit London.''
   ``If I meet him I will ask him `Why do you shoot children'?'' Abu
Sharif said. ``He will of course ask me, `Why are you rioting'?''
   Rabin has met extensively with Palestinian officials in the
occupied lands, but, in line with government policy, has said he
would not negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Rabin has left for a fund-raising tour in Switzerland and was
scheduled to go to London before returning to Israel next week, said
a Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Recent polls have indicated the majority of Israelis support
negotiations with the PLO under certain conditions.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday reiterated his opposition
to talks with the PLO, saying the organization was still intent on
destroying Israel.
   Shamir also rejected a demand by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that Israel agree to talks with the PLO and an
international Middle East peace conference as the price of renewing
diplomatic ties.
   ``We will not accept any conditions for the resumption of
relations,'' Shamir told a news conference after a three-day visit
to France. ``As long as the Soviet Union doesn't renew ties with
Israel, from our view it cannot be involved in any way in the peace
process in the region.''
   The statement appeared to contradict an earlier one by Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens who said after a meeting with Shevardnadze he
believed the Soviets could play a role in Middle East peacemaking
even without diplomatic ties with Israel.

   It will take more than theft of computers, rifling
of files and a six-alarm arson fire to put the Dallas Gay Alliance
out of business, its president said Friday as operations continued
at temporary quarters.
   ``If it were the arsonist's intentions to halt our work, it
didn't happen,'' said William Waybourn. The alliance operates
several outreach programs, including the AIDS Resource Center of
Dallas that also was housed in the destroyed building.
   Damage caused by the fire in a strip shopping center was
estimated at $750,000, said fire Capt. J.E. Foster. No injuries were
reported.
   ``The fire set us back an hour, that's how much they halted our
service to the gay community and to people with AIDS,'' he said.
``We deal with AIDS day in and day out. Believe me, a fire we can
handle.''
   Investigators ruled the center was set afire early Thursday after
its offices were ransacked and computers and legal documents were
stolen. Arson investigators said they had no suspects. Two other
businesses also were destroyed.
   No confidential information about AIDS clients was taken,
Waybourn said.
   ``Those files won't mean anything to anybody except us,'' he
said. ``We've always been an open organization. They could have
gotten the same information just by calling us.''
   Missing documents included papers concerning efforts to have
state district Judge Jack Hampton removed from office, Waybourn said.
   Dallas Gay Alliance offices had been a center of activity for
attempts to oust Hampton since December, when he was quoted in a
newspaper article as saying he gave a lighter sentence to a killer
because his two victims were homosexuals.
   Arson investigators suspect a petroleum product may have been
used to ignite the fire becaue of the intense heat it generated,
fire officials said. Results of laboratory rests were expected
Monday.
   Waybourn said all of the alliance's services continued Friday
thanks to community support, including donations of equipment and
furniture. He said an electronic security alarm system and 24-hour
security guards also were donanted.
   Waybourn also said a new weekly program of low-cost anonymous
AIDS tests was launched Thursday as planned, albeit to a lower
number than expected.
   ``We only had a few people come by for it,'' Waybourn said. ``But
I think that's because of all the TV cameras _ that makes it hard to
be anonymous.''
   The three missing computers contained information about the
alliance's activities, including lists of donors and organization
members. Alliance leaders said the missing materials could not be
used to identify any clients, including those with AIDS.
   Waybourn said the center had some insurance ``but not enough to
cover our losses. It's hard to get coverage on a facility like
ours.''

<HEAD>Narrow Conservative Victory Points to Thatcher Disapproval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Conservative Party narrowly retained
one of its safest parliamentary seats Friday against a strong show
of voter disapproval of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies.
   The special election in the wealthy Richmond district in northern
England saw the Tory majority tumble from nearly 20,000 votes to
2,600, saved from defeat only by a split centrist vote.
   It was the biggest collapse of Conservative support since Mrs.
Thatcher came to power in 1979.
   The main opposition Labor Party, which earlier Friday kept its
seat at Pontypridd in South Wales in another by-election, was beaten
into fourth place in Richmond.
   The elections to fill vacant seats in the 650-seat House of
Commons came midway through Mrs. Thatcher's third term, with polls
showing a sharp dro in Tory support and increased backing for Labor.
   Richmond voters appeared to reflect the widespread hostility to
government plans to reform the state-funded National Health Service
and privatize the country's water companies, and to the recent
upsurge in inflation.
   ``There has been something of a protest vote against the
government,'' said William Hague, 27, the victorious Conservative
candidate in Richmond. ``We have had problems on the issue of health
reforms and on the proposed privatization of water. We still have a
lot of convincing to do.''
   The Richmond election had been watched closely to see which of
Britain's two feuding centrist parties _ David Owen's splinter
Social Democrats or Paddy Ashdown's larger, newly merged Social and
Liberal Democrats _ would poll more votes.
   The Social Democrats did by a wide margin, and Owen called it ``a
stunning result ... (which) shows that sticking with your beliefs
pays off in British politics.''
   The results gave Hague 19,543 votes; Social Democrat Michael
Potter 16,909; Social Liberal Democrat Barbara Pearce 11,589; and
Labor's Frank Robson 2,591.
   Potter and Pearce said the results showed their parties should
try to unite behind a single candidate before the next general
election, which Mrs. Thatcher must call by June 1992.
   In Pontypridd, Labor candidate Kim Howells, 42, a research
officer with the left-led National Union of Mineworkers, won 20,549
votes or 53.3 percent.
   Second-place went to the Plaid Cymru Welsh nationalist candidate,
Syd Morgan, with 9,755 votes or 25.3 percent. Plaid Cymru, with
three seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, seeks independence for
Wales. Tory Nigel Evans trailed with 5,212 votes or 13.5 percent.
   Pontypridd is a Labor stronghold in the once thriving but now
largely neglected industrial heartland of South Wales, and Howells'
victory was predictable.
   Labor has lost three consecutive general elections to Mrs.
Thatcher since 1979. Party leader Neil Kinnock is trying to edge
Labor away from some of its hard-line socialist doctrines and soften
its advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   Labor has gained in the polls because of discontent with Thatcher
policies, especially the government's plans for the National Health
Service, which many voters see as a first step toward a mainly
private system.
   The service will remain free to patients but hospitals will
compete with each other for fees of state-funded patients and for
private patients. The elderly will get tax breaks for buying private
health insurance.
   The Pontypridd election was caused by the death of local Labor
legislator Brynmor John. The Richmond election was called following
the appointment of the Conservative incumbent, Sir Leon Brittan, to
the European Economic Community's executive commission.

<HEAD>Videotape Details Laurie Dann's Last Day: Arson, Gunfire and Poison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A videotape that recreates Laurie Dann's
last day _ a nightmare of deadly gunfire at an elementary school,
arson, poison and suicide _ helps spare Police Chief Herbert Timm
the strain of retelling the grim story.
   ``But it also brings back memories. It makes it as vivid as when
I was there,'' said Timm, who is using the video in presentations on
the deadly events of last May 20 to law enforcement, social work and
community groups.
   ``We started getting so many requests, we decided to make a video
that might stand on its own,'' Winnetka Police Lt. Joe Sumner said
Friday.
   ``Community Crisis: The Laurie Dann Case'' recreates Dann's
violent rampage in this comfortable north Chicago suburb.
   Dann, 30, opened fire in a second-grade classroom at Winnetka's
Hubbard Woods elementary school, killing one student and wounding
five. She then ran to a nearby home and wounded a college student
before killing herself.
   The video recounts the events beginning at 10:20 a.m., when the
city's Fire Department received its first call about a fire in the
house where Dann babysat, to 7:20 p.m., when police found her dead.
   Police later found evidence she had attempted to set fires and
deliver poison snacks and drinks before the school shootings.
   The video includes Timm's estimate that if Dann had killed
everyone she tried to burn, poison and shoot that day, the death
toll would have been 50 instead of two _ an 8-year-old boy and Dann
herself _ and six wounded.
   ``Every time I see it, tears come to my eyes,'' Timm said.
   The video also includes the chief's candid admission that
reporters' questions helped shape police strategy.
   ``They would ask ... `Chief, how about this? Chief, how about
that?' And I would say, `Well, we're working on that, we're looking
into it,''' Timm recalled on the video.
   ``Then I'd race back into the building and say ... `My God, have
you guys thought about looking into this?'''
   Survivors or victims' families were not interviewed, said
independent producer Gerald Rogers, who donated his hourlong,
$50,000 production to this village of about 13,000.
   ``We tried very hard not to be sensationalistic or to exploit
anyone,'' Rogers said. ``I wanted people to learn.''
   The camera bursts into the bathroom where one boy was shot and
moves into a second-grade classroom, where the woman's gunfire
killed Nicholas Corwin and wounded four other children. Still
photographs capture the aftermath of bloody clothing, a bloody floor.
   Stark photographs of Dann's body, face down on a carpet, mark the
end of the daylong assault, though Rogers said he debated over using
them.
   ``For a storyteller, it had a finality to it that was hard to
overlook,'' said Rogers, who lives in neighboring Kenilworth and
produces education film and videotapes.
   Timm turned to Rogers to help with the video project after the
two met while working together with parents concerned about drug and
alcohol abuse.
   The tape sells for $450 and rents for $100. Any profits will go
to the Winnetka Police Department.
   ``It showed us there are some things we did wrong _ we had
problems with command posts (in the right place) and problems with
communication when calls from reporters and families saturated our
phone lines,'' Sumner said.
   The video brings back tragic memories for him, too.
   ``But if it's going to help someone in the future,'' Sumner
added,``it's worth the pain.''

   President Saddam Hussein conferred Friday
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on the deadlocked
Iran-Iraq peace talks and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the talks were held at
Hussein's resort home in the southern city of Basra, which was
devastated by Iranian attacks during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Shevardnadze handed Hussein a message from Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev during the three-hour meeting, the agency reported. It
did not disclose the contents.
   Iraqi Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah and Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz also attended the meeting.
   Hussein, the agency said, told Shevardnadze that Iraq ``was
opposed to efforts to freeze the Iran-Iraq conflict and maintain the
present no-war, no-peace situation.''
   Shevarnadze told Hussein that Moscow ``respects the Iraqi stand
and its determination to work for a settlement of the conflict,''
the agency said.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire halted the war Aug. 20. But peace
talks that began five days later have been deadlocked over troop
withdrawals.
   Upon arriving Thursday in Baghdad, the fourth stop on his Middle
East tour, Shevardnadze said he was concerned about lack of progress
in the peace negotiations.
   He will be in Tehran on Saturday, where he has been granted a
rare audience with Iranain leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Eastern diplomats here said Shevardnadze would press Iraqi and
Iranian leaders to work toward a peace treaty in the negotiations
being conducted under United Nations auspices.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's major weapons supplier and one of its
key trade partners, is believed to have supplied Iraq with billions
of dollars worth of goods on credit during the gulf war.
   Shevardnadze and Hussein also touched on the Arab-Israeli
conflict, the Iraqi news agency said.
   The two hailed the PLO's peace overtures and agreed to work to
``activate a serious initiative that would lead to peace in the
Middle East,'' the news agency reported.
   Shevardnadze arrived in Baghdad from Cairo, where he said
Thursday that Israel must agree to talk with the PLO and accept an
international peace conference as the price of resuming full
diplomatic relations with the Kremlin.
   Israel has said relations must come before an expanded Soviet
role in peace negotiations.
   Shevardnadze met separately with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Cairo on Wednesday.
   Israel opposes a U.N.-organized peace conference but has said it
would go to one under the auspices of the United States and the
Soviet Union. The Israelis, however, vow never to talk with the PLO,
which they accuse of being a terrorist organization.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. on Friday paid the
$465 million settlement ordered by the Supreme Court for the Bhopal
gas leak. The court also began hearing a petition asking the
settlement be raised to $600 million.
   The Danbury, Conn.-based company made its payment four weeks
ahead of the deadline imposed by the court. The Indian government
has a week to submit to the court a breakdown of how the funds will
be allotted.
   On Wednesday, the Association for Socio-Legal Literacy submitted
a petition asking that compensation for the 1984 disaster, which
killed more than 3,400 people, be increased to $600 million.
   A same five-judge Supreme Court panel that ordered the first
settlement began preliminary hearings Friday on the petition.
   R.K. Garg, an attorney for the group, has argued the settlement
``challenged the concept of India as a free nation'' by
``capitulating'' to Union Carbide and had ``fettered its fine
Constitution to the whims of a multinational company.''
   Lawyers for Union Carbide refused comment on the petition.
   The government says 20,000 people were seriously affected by
exposure to the methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from the Bhopal
pesticide plant operated the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide.
   On Feb. 14, the Supreme Court ordered Union Carbide to pay $470
million in final settlement of all claims. However, the court ruled
last week that Union Carbide could receive credit for $5 million
deposited after New York District Judge John Keenan ruled in 1986
that the money be made available for immediate relief to the victims.
   Opposition politicians and gas victims have denounced the
settlement as too low. The Indian government originally sued Union
Carbide for $3 billion.

<HEAD>Brazilian Indians Demand Suspension of Amazon Dam</HEAD>
<UNK>By PETER MUELLO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chiefs of Amazon Indian tribes ended a
historic meeting Friday with a demand to stop plans to build a
hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands.
   Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and
black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader Ailton
Krenac read an appeal to protect Amazonia, home to most of Brazil's
220,000 native people.
   ``We do not want the construction of dams on the Xingu River and
on other rivers in the Amazon, because they threaten Indian
nations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople and
representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded.
   More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for five
days in this eastern Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, to protest the proposed Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River,
an Amazon tributary. It was the first time Indians in Brazil set
aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a
political movement.
   The reservoir of the $5.8 billion dam would flood 500 square
miles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of 11
million kilowatts _ 40 percent more than that of Grand Coulee, the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the United States.
   ``For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and the
spirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is the
sacred site of our people, the home of our creator that cannot be
violated,'' Krenac said.
   The government contends Brazil must tap the vast hydroelectric
potential of the Amazon basin to progress. Federal electric power
officials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built.
Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inches
from the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribal
people said that was merely a symbolic gesture.
   Congressman Tadeu Franca, pledged to carry on the Indians' fight
in Brasilia, the capital. ``Because of this meeting, it will be
Indians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that will
build the Indians' history,'' he said.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will go
back to their villages with the sense that something really new and
important has happened,'' said Terry Turner, a U.S. anthropologist
who has worked more than 20 years with the Kayapo Indians.
   Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993. It must
first be approved by Congress.
   Brazil has shown interest in getting partial financing for the
project from the World Bank, but Indians and environmental groups
are asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money.
   In a small victory this week, the Indians won an agreement from
the government electric power company in Amazonia to change the name
of the project to Belo Monte from Kararao. Kararao is a war cry of
the Kayapo tribe and was offensive to other tribes.

<HEAD>Couple Won't Seek Custody Of Child They Think Was Swapped At Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple won't seek custody of a 10-year-old
girl they believe is their daughter, but they still want genetic
testing done to determine whether they are her real parents, their
lawyer said Friday.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for a
chance to visit with the girl, and make her part of their family,
said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney.
   ``They were becoming very frustrated with the public's
perception. They have always intended to do what is best for
everyone,'' said Blakely.
   The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last year seeking genetic testing of
the girl, Kimberly Mays. The girl's father, Robert Mays, a roofing
supply salesman from Sarasota, is fighting to block the tests.
   The Twiggs claim they brought the wrong child home from Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula in 1978, and that Robert and Barbara
Mays took their child the same day.
   The girl the Twiggs raised, named Arlena, died of a congenital
heart defect last August. They learned through blood tests that she
was not their daughter.
   Kimberly and Arlena were the only two white baby girls in the
hospital at the same time. The Twiggs, who maintain hospital
personnel deliberately switched their healthy daughter for a sickly
child, have asked a Sarasota court to order genetic testing to
determine Kimberly's parentage.
   ``This doesn't change the lawsuit at all,'' Blakely said.
   In December, Mays said Kimberly inscribed a drawing she gave him
for Christmas: ``I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.''
   Mays' wife, Barbara, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried and
later divorced.
   Mrs. Twigg said she and her husband first considered seeking
custody because they suspected Mays participated in the alleged baby
swap, but now there is no evidence to support that.
   The Twiggs, who have seven children, later grew concerned about
public sentiment that they were being unfair to Kimberly. They say
they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists.
   ``You take a step back and say, `What is in the best interest of
everybody involved?''' Mrs. Twigg told The Tampa Tribune in an
interview published in Friday editions, breaking four months of
silence in the case. ``We feel that we should not be denied the
right to know that girl as a child.''
   Blakely said while there have been no discussions with Mays or
his attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, the Twiggs should be the ones to
determine extent of the visitation, relying on guidance from
psychologists and psychiatrists.
   ``I think the only basis the Twiggs would seek custody is if some
professional told them it would be in Kimberly's best interest to
remove her from Mr. May's house, which we do not anticipate,'' said
Blakely.
   Ginsburg was not available Friday, his office said. Mays could
not be reached; he has an unpublished telephone number.

   A West German businessman who was convicted of
illegally re-exporting a chemical warfare ingredient to Iran has
been denied all U.S. export privileges for 10 years, the Commerce
Department said Friday.
   Peter Walaschek was convicted in U.S. District Court in Baltimore
last August after pleading guilty to illegally re-exporting
U.S.-made thiodiglycol from Singapore to Iran in violation of the
Export Administration Act, the department said. The substance is an
ingredient of mustard gas, which is used in chemical warfare.
   Between January 1987 and April 1988, Walaschek purchased more
than 210 tons of the substance in the United States for shipment to
Singapore and Greece, then re-exported the chemical from Singapore
to Iran without approval from the Commerce Department, the agency
said.
   Commerce Undersecretary Paul Freedenberg said the department's
action ``demonstrates the importance the United States places on
prevention of the further spread of chemicals used for warfare.''
   Freedenberg said that Walaschek deliberately tried to hide the
true destination of the chemicals he purchased and that the
transactions highlight ``what countries such as Iran will do to
acquire the chemicals they need to wage chemical warfare.''

<HEAD>Third Associate Of Winnie Mandela Linked To Youth's Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third associate of Winnie
Mandela appeared in court Friday in connection with the slaying of a
14-year-old activist who allegedly was assaulted at Mrs. Mandela's
house.
   John Morgan, 61, appeared briefly in Johannesburg Magistrate's
Court. Authorities have identified him as the bus driver for Mrs.
Mandela's unofficial bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer
club.
   On Tuesday, the self-described coach of Mandela United, Jerry
Richardson, and a 17-year-old club member were arraigned in court on
charges of murdering activist Stompie Seipei, 14. They were arrested
Sunday at Mrs. Mandela's home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg.
   Mrs. Mandela is the wife of Nelson Mandela, the jailed chief of
the African National Congress, the largest group fighting the
white-dominated government.
   Last week, major anti-apartheid groups accused Mandela United
members of conducting a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto and said Mrs.
Mandela should be ostracized. The groups stressed that they remained
loyal to Nelson Mandela.
   Morgan's appearance in court Friday was procedural and did not
deal with the substance of the case against him, officials said.
News of the appearance was the first disclosure Morgan had been
arrested.
   Seipei, whose funeral is scheduled for Saturday, allegedly was
abducted in late December along with three other young men, taken to
Mrs. Mandela's home and assaulted.
   Seipei's decomposed body was found in a field on Jan. 7 and was
identified by forensic experts two weeks ago.
   Mandela summoned three prominent anti-apartheid lawyers for a
four-hour meeting Thursday at Victor Verster prison farm near Cape
Town, but details of the discussions have not been disclosed.
   Seipei's murder is one of four recent killings involving people
connected directly or indirectly to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards.
   On Wednesday, a 13-year-old Soweto girl was killed when gunmen
fired on her house with AK-47 rifles and set the dwelling on fire
with a firebomb. Police said the attack might have been in revenge
for the killing last week of Maxwell Madondo, a member of Mandela
United.
   Last month, Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, a physician and activist, was
shot and killed at his Soweto clinic. A suspect has confessed to
shooting Asvat during a robbery attempt, and police say the case is
non-political. But Mrs. Mandela has suggested that Asvat may have
been killed because he had examined Seipei and other youths she said
were sexually molested by a Methodist minister.
   Methodist leaders have denied the sex allegations and accused
Mrs. Mandela of falsely implying that the church conspired with
police to discredit her.
   The African National Congress and a committee of Soweto activists
have suggested that Mandela United was infiltrated by police agents,
but these groups have criticized Mrs. Mandela for poor judgment and
lack of discipline.
   In another development, anti-apartheid leaders criticized the
government for not releasing more detainees following negotiations
to end a hunger strike.
   Nearly 300 black detainees in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth
suspended a three-week hunger strike last week after Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok told anti-apartheid church leaders that a
``substantial number'' of detainees would be released within two
weeks.
   Mary Burton, president of the Black Sash civil rights group, told
a news conference held by several activists that only 17 detainees
had been released.
   ``This is not a substantial number of detainees, and does not
enable us to report to the hunger strikers that their suffering and
their agreement to suspend the strike have been vindicated,'' she
said.
   Many of the detainees have been held for more than two years
without charges, and they are demanding that they either be charged
or released.

   A military jury reprimanded
a U.S. Navy captain Friday for not giving enough help to a boatload
of Vietnamese refugees who resorted to cannibalism to survive.
   The jury of six Navy captains could have jailed Alexander Balian,
a decorated Vietnam war veteran, for 90 days and made him forfeit
two-thirds of his pay for three months.
   It said he erred in handling the situation that arose last June 9
while his ship was in the South China Sea but deserved no further
punishment than being relieved of command, as he was in August.
   He was acquitted of the more serious charge of ordering one
refugee shaken off ropes as the man tried to climb aboard the
amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque.
   Balian, 48, claimed he was made a scapegoat and said, ``Heroes
like me are hung out to dry when they get in trouble.''
   He was charged with failing to render adequate assistance to more
than 80 Vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the Dubuque encountered
about 250 miles north of the Philippine island of Palawan.
   U.N. officials said 31 refugees later died and survivors said
they had eaten the flesh of the dead before Filipino fishermen
rescued them June 27.

   City Council gave approval to a ribs

   The ``World Series of Ribs'' on Memorial Day weekend will include
fireworks, entertainment, magicians and a pig race.
   Would the pigs be treated cruelly in the race, Council member
Janice Rettman wanted to know.
   Council member Kiki Sonnen said an animal-rights activist, after

   Four state lawmakers hope they can lure
President Bush to the waters of Wisconsin with a free fishing permit.
   The lawmakers said they'll buy the 15-day non-resident fishing
permit for $15.10 which Bush can redeem if he takes a Wisconsin
vacation.
   When the Legislature reconvenes next month, they plan to
introduce a resolution, which says, in part:
   ``Whereas President Bush is an avid fisherman who has fished
fresh and salt water from New England to the Gulf of Mexico;
   ``And whereas our well-schooled president has angled his way to
the nation's premier perch at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington,
D.C.;
   ``And whereas the Wisconsin Legislature desires to open the
waters of the kinder, gentler Badger State for the president to
legally fish.''
   The resolution closes with an invitation to Bush to fish in
Wisconsin and the offer of a free fishing permit.

   Leftist guerrillas made the
second charge in as many days Friday that the army attacked one of
their field hospitals. The report said one person was killed and
another wounded.
   The armed forces denied both allegations.
   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said soldiers used light
artillery and small arms in an attack Feb. 18 on a field hospital
near Santa Clara in San Vicente province, about 40 miles east of San
Salvador.
   On Thursday, the Legal Aid Office of the Roman Catholic church
said 10 people were slain in an army attack Feb. 13 on a rebel field
hospital.
   A ``brigadista'' was killed in the attack last Saturday and a
patient was wounded, Venceremos said, adding that soldiers ``stole
and destroyed all hospital supplies and medicines.''
   The report did not identify the ``brigadista,'' a term often used
for armed paramedics.
   Col. Galileo Torres, director of the Armed Forces Press Office,
denied the Radio Venceremos report.
   ``What's happening is that the rebels are trying to continue with
the line that we are violators of human rights and of the Geneva
Convention'' on human rights, he said in a telephone interview.
   Torres said ``there normally aren't hospitals'' in the area of
the alleged attack ``because there is constant combat and military
units constantly force the guerrillas to move on.''
   The Legal Aid Office said Thursday two of those killed in the
Feb. 13 attack in the northern province of Chalatenango _ a woman
doctor and a 14-year-old girl _ may have been raped.
   Venceremos claimed Feb. 15 that soldiers of the Atlacatl
Battalion attacked and destroyed the field hospital two days
earlier. It said three medical workers and three guerrilla patients
were killed.
   Both the Legal Aid Office and rebel radio identified the possible
rape victims as Alejandra Bravo Betancourt, a 35-year-old Mexican
doctor, and Rosibel Dubon, a paramedic's aide. Their bodies were
exhumed and examined Feb. 17 by the representatives of the Legal Aid
Office, a respected human rights organization.
   Legal Aid said five wounded guerrillas and three other medical
aides also were killed at the hospital outside Los Encuentros
village near the Sumpul River, which forms El Salvador's border with
Honduras.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, military commander of Chalatenango
province, told reporters Thursday there was no field hospital near
Los Encuentros. He said Atlacatl soldiers killed several guerrillas,
including the Mexican doctor, in combat Feb. 13.
   Legal Aid concluded that a field hospital was set up near Los
Encuentros and Atlacatl troops ``attacked and destroyed the field
hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel present.''
   It called the attack ``a flagrant violation'' of El Salvador's
constitution and the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which El Salvador
is a signatory.

<HEAD>Regulators Reject Charge that Policies Discourage Third World Debt
Forgiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal bank regulators, in a report to
Congress released Friday, rejected charges that their policies
discourage banks from forgiving part of the huge debt owed by Third
World countries.
   ``Current regulatory policy and accounting policies have not
prevented banks, that were otherwise inclined to do so, from
participating in a wide range of negotiated debt reduction
transactions with borrowing countries,'' three regulatory agencies
said in a report to the Senate Banking Committee.
   Critics of current policy say banks are discouraged from
realistically recognizing losses on Third World debt. They say banks
should be permitted to spread the effects of recognizing losses over
several years. Currently, they must reduce their profit by the full
amount of any addition to loss reserves.
   However, the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said accounting
standards are designed to present a true picture of banks' financial
condition, adding, ``accounting policies ... are not intended to
encourage or discourage any actions that management considers to be
in the best interest of the institution.''
   They cited World Bank estimates showing that $20 billion in
developing country debt has been eliminated in the past two years.
   The three agencies also said that banks' exposure to developing
country debt had improved considerably since the crisis first
emerged in 1982 but was still large for the nation's 10 biggest
banks.
   At the end of September, the 10 largest banks were on the hook to
developing countries for loans representing 95 percent of the banks'
capital and loss reserves.
   And, the report endorsed the continuation of the so-called Baker
plan, which rejects taxpayer contributions toward solving the
problem and encourages case-by-case negotiations for additional
lending rather than any coordinated plan of debt forgiveness.
   The approach is named after Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, who developed while serving as Ronald Reagan's Treasury
secretary.
   ``The bank regulatory agencies continue to believe the
case-by-case negotiated approach is the best method,'' the report
said.
   President Bush has said his administration will take a new look
at the approach, but has advocated no specific changes.
   On another point, the report said the secondary market for
selling and swapping Third World loans is a poor indicator of the
loans' true value. Many analysts say they are worried because the
loans are now worth about 40 percent of their original value, down
from 60 percent in mid-1987. The regulators said secondary market
prices may reflect short-term supply and demand rather than the
long-term value of the loans.
   The regulators' report is the first installment toward meeting
the requirements of a section of last year's trade act. A second
report, due by May 31, will examine the effects of Third World
lending on bank profits between 1977 and 1987.
   The Treasury Department was supposed to deliver another report
this week on new approaches for solving the debt crisis, but was
given a three-week extension.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
refused to work on Friday to protest ethnic discrimination and to
demand the resignation of a provincial Communist Party chief.
   Yugoslav Communist Party leader Stipe Suvar descended a mine
shaft to meet with miners who began the strike Monday, but they
reportedly told another official that ``you can have us out only in
our coffins.''
   The state-run media said 40,000 people have staged sympathy
strikes across Kosovo, a province of Serbia, one of six Yugoslav
republics.
   Schools, universities and most businesses closed Friday, and the
Tanjug news agency described the province as ``on the verge of a
general strike and total paralysis.''
   Suvar and Serbian party boss Slobodan Milosevic rushed to
Pristina, the provincial capital, to prevent possible ethnic clashes
between Kosovo's Albanian majority and the Slav minority.
   ``The crisis has reached critical point,'' Suvar said at a
meeting in Pristina, the provincial capital. ``We must stop at all
cost the worsening of the situation.''
   The protesters condemn Serbia's drive to secure greater control
over Kosovo by changing the current constitution, fearing they would
lose wide autonomy granted to them in 1974. They also demand the
resignation of provincial party leader Rahman Morina, who they
consider an ally of Serbian party boss Slobodan Milosevic.
   Serbian leaders have asserted that they must have more control in
Kosovo to protect the mainly Christian Slav minority allegedly
persecuted by predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 85
percent of the province's population.
   President Raif Dizdarevic said he would ``take all measures under
the constitution and laws'' to prevent ``violations of order and
peace and thhreats to the constitutional system.''
   Foreigners traveling to Kosovo noticed an unuusally large number
of police, an indication that units were sent to Kosovo from Serbia.
There was no official confirmation.
   More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some on a hunger strike,
have refused to leave their pits at the Trepca mines.
   Later Friday, Suvar met with the Trepca mine's management and
said that ``nobody, not even the miners, have a right to issue
political ultimatums to the country.''
   Suvar, who spent three hours with the striking miners, left the
Trepca mine without any apparent result. He would not comment on the
meeting.
   Suvar was told by Aziz Abrasi, the director of the mine, that the
miners have told him ``you can have us out only in our coffins.''
   About 250 miners have asked for medical aid, said Dr. Nedjmi
Zeciri, the mine's medical officer. Six were hospitalized for
exhaustion, while the rest received treatement at the makeshift
first aid station outside the mine, he said.
   Milosevic on Friday reiterated his stand by saying in Pristina
that ``Albanian nationalism'' has caused ''physical, political and
cultural violence over'' Slavs in the province, ''which is
unprecedented in Europe today.''
   In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in
Pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial
officials as demanded by Serbia's leaders.

   A young Lebanese radical was
convicted and sentenced to life in prison Friday for the 1987
hijacking of a jetliner and the murder of a French passenger.
   Switzerland's highest court branded Hussein Hariri, 22, a
political fanatic whose actions were ``especially despicable and
cold-blooded.''
   Hariri single-handedly commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 flying
from Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris on July 24, 1987. He demanded the
release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by France, West Germany
and Israel.
   Hariri asked to be flown to Beirut but agreed to a refueling stop
in Geneva, where he shot passenger Xavier Beaulieu, 28, when his
deadline for refueling the plane expired.
   The five-member Federal Criminal Court, which convenes only in
cases of ``particular gravity,'' convicted Hariri on all seven
counts against him, including murder, attempted murder and hostage
taking.
   The bearded Hariri, a Shiite Moslem whom prosecutors called a
``killer blinded by conviction,'' listened impassively as chief
judge Jean-Jacques Leu read the sentence.
   In Lebanon, Hariri's father said tearfully he had expected his
son would get a severe sentence, but not life.
   ``I cannot do anything now. I wish I could visit him in jail, but
I do not have the money to buy an air ticket to Switzerland,''
Mohammed Hariri, 61, said in Deir Qanaoun Nahr, near the southern
port of Tyre.
   ``I do not want to talk about my son. Nobody is with him and no
one can help him,'' his mother, Felleh Hariri said at the family
residence ajacent to the grocery shop they own.
   Hariri will be eligible for parole after 15 years. He was also
ordered to pay $657,000 in damages, mostly to Air Afrique.
   During the five-day trial, Hariri told the court he was a
``soldier of God'' and did not want to kill.
   He refused to testify about allegations he was on a mission for
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group, Lebanon's most militant faction.
   Hariri reportedly told interrogators before the trial he joined
Hezbollah in 1985 after his release from an Israeli prison.
Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of
the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Investigators said Hariri boarded the plane at Bangui, Central
African Republic, carrying a pistol, 140 rounds of ammunition and
explosives. Hariri said he bribed his way around security checks.
   Swiss police stormed the hijacked jet and arrested Hariri after
crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing in safety
chutes. A flight attendant was shot and seriously injured when he
jumped Hariri.
   Hariri's demands included the release of the Hamadi brothers, two
Lebanese arrested in West Germany as terror suspects.
   One of them, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, has been on trial in Frankfurt
since July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a TWA airliner to
Beirut, in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans held
hostage for 17 days.
   The other Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted by a West German
court of arranging the kidnapping of two West Germans in Beirut to
win freedom for his brother. The West Germans have since been freed.
   When a Swiss Red Cross delegate was kidnapped in Lebanon last
November, Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber said the abduction was
aimed gaining leniency for Hariri.
   The envoy of the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red
Cross, Peter Winkler, was released after a month in the hands of
captors who were never identified. Switzerland said no concessions
were made.

   A man who shuttled between Central America and

   Robert W. Owen, 35, said at North's Iran-Contra trial that he

leaders that he signed memos with the initials ``T.C.,'' meaning
``the courier.''
   Despite their extensive dealings, Owen testified, North told him
he had told Congress the two had only a passing relationship.
   ``To my best recollection he said he met me a couple of times, he
said, `I met you a couple of times. I knew you were an activist
supporting the Nicaraguan resistance,''' Owen quoted North as saying.
   Owen told jurors he actually met with North 80 to 100 times
between July 1983 and August 1984 on Contra matters.
   Among the charges against North is an accusation he lied to the
House intelligence committee by saying he had only casual contact
with Owen.
   On at least three occasions, Owen said, he carried maps and
photographs from North to Nicaraguan rebel leaders at meetings in
Honduras, including one in November 1984. The documents he carried
showed details of the airport in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital,
and also included details of terrain and specific Sandinista
emplacements.
   Also among the 12 charges for which North is being tried are
allegations that he lied to Congress by denying reports that he was
giving tactical and procurement advice to the Contras in defiance of
the ban which took effect in October 1984. He was a Marine
lieutenant colonel and a top National Security Council aide at the
time.
   In 1985, Owen testified, he took part in efforts to open a
``southern front'' along Nicaragua's Costa Rican border. At North's
direction he flew to Costa Rica to view possible sites for an
airstrip that eventually was built for the effort to resupply the
Contras.
   He said he also, reluctantly, accepted $1,000 in traveler's
checks from North as a wedding present. The government charges that
that money was part of $4,300 that North is accused of embezzling.
   Owen said that in March 1986 the role of retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord _ who he said was running the secret arms
resupply network for North _ was being exposed. ``What you had hoped
to keep quiet is now being openly discussed on the street,'' Owen
wrote to North in a memo. Secord also faces criminal charges in the
Iran-Contra affair but has yet to come to trial.
   That same month, Owen testified, North asked him to fly to
Honduras aboard a plane loaded with humanitarian supplies, then to
supervise loading of weapons to be dropped to the rebels. Owen, who
by then was working with a U.S. government humanitarian relief
effort, protested his contract barred him from delivering weapons.
   ``He said, between the two of us, I would fly down on NHAO
(Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office), put on my Robert Owen
private citizen hat, and fly with the ammunition,'' Owen testified.
   He said when he got to Honduras there was no ammunition to be
loaded.
   Prosecutors questioned Owen for nearly five hours Friday. North's
lawyers will cross-examine him Monday.
   Owen, who testified under a prosecution grant of immunity, is a
1978 Stanford University graduate. After college he worked for the
Senate Republican Conference and was an aide to then-Sen. Dan
Quayle, who is now vice president. After leaving Quayle's office, he
went to work for Gray and Co., one of the largest Washington public
relations firms.
   When Contra representatives asked the firm in 1983 to set up a
fund-raising campaign, Owen said he was sent to North. In the course
of things, he met Contra leader Adolfo Calero and eventually went on
his payroll with undefined duties for $2,500 a month salary and
expenses.
   He said his work was ``more with North than Calero.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he was puzzled why so
many memos that Owen wrote North contained aliases.
   ``I did not want to put his name or my name on documents I was
writing,'' Owen said. ``For security reasons I just did not want my
name floating around. For the same reason I did not want to put
Colonel North's name on documents.
   North was referred to as ``Steelhammer,'' ``Hammer'' and ``B.G.''
The latter stood for ``Blood and Guts,'' Owen testified.
   A month after the congressional edict against U.S. military aid
to the Contras, Owen said North outlined a plan for attacking Soviet
Hind helicopters that were being delivered to the Managua airport.
Owen said he relayed North's idea and delivered maps of the airport
to Calero in Honduras.
   Owen described the armor-clad Hind helicopter as ``the most
dangerous helicopter in the world.'' He said North was ``concerned
if these weapons, these platforms, were targeted against the
Nicaraguan resistance, it would decimate it.''
   The Contras, fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government, had only
three small airplanes of a push-pull type in which there was one
propeller in front and one aft.
   North feared the raid ``would be a suicide mission undertaken by
the pilots'' who would not have enough fuel to return to their base,
Owen said.
   On another trip south in early 1985, Owen said, North asked him
to take a series of maps to Calero in Honduras. North also asked
that he get from Calero ``a list of military goods needed right
now.''

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with ``many thousands'' attending,

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Estonians celebrated their
Independence Day Friday by hoisting their national flag over the
highest castle tower in the capital of Tallinn after relegating the
flag of Soviet Estonia to a museum.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said ``many thousands''
of people attended, including the republic's Communist Party chief
Vaino Vyalyas. Soviet television showed crowds in the cobble-stoned
Old Town of the Baltic port.
   Estonia was a province of the czarist Russian empire, but it
proclaimed itself independent on Feb. 24, 1918, after the 1917
Bolshevik revolution. The small Baltic republic was absorbed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 under a secret protocol between Nazi Germany
and Moscow that divided East Europe into spheres of influence.
   The blue, black and white banner hoisted on Friday was the flag
of independent Estonia between the world wars.
   The flag of Soviet Estonia that flew for decades when displaying
the tricolor banner was illegal was taken down Thursday night before
and given to a local Communist historical museum, the official
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   ``The decision to proclaim Feb. 24 as the day of Estonia's
independence and to raise the blue, black and white national flag on
the Gherman tower on that day is an important step toward restoring
the Estonian people's dignity and recognizing their genuine
history,'' said a statement issued by the Estonian Communist Party.
   The flag-raising ceremony also was attended by clergymen and
representatives of the People's Front unofficial political movement.
   The People's Front has led the drive during the past year to
wrest more cultural and economic autonomy from Moscow. Party and
government leaders have been replaced by those sympathetic to the
organization's goals. In November the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, declared sovereignty in all areas except foreign and
military affairs.
   The Kremlin declared that move invalid, but Estonia has not
backed down.
   Arnold Ruitel, president of the presidium of the republic's
Supreme Soviet, told a rally outside the tower, ``it should be
clearly realized that dates of national history and national symbols
should not be regarded as something hostile to socialism.''
   Soviet officials last summer eased restrictions on the drive for
more autonomy in the nearby republics of Latvia and Lithuania as
well as in Estonia.
   The local parliaments moved quickly to make ethnic languages
official and permit use of national flags on holidays, sporting
events and cultural rallies.

<TEXT>
   Opposition and government negotiators
agreed on a proposal Friday that would allow new trade unions to
form and legalize the Solidarity independent union movement,
officials said.
   The proposal was reached by a working group that is part of the
broad talks between the government and opposition on political and
economic reforms.
   The proposed labor law is the result of a Feb. 16 agreement by
the sides to amend the current labor act. The proposal would have to
be passed by the Sejm, or parliament, to become law.
   The proposal would allow trade unions to organize nationally. The
current law that took effect in 1982 restricted how quickly a
nationwide union could form.
   ``The whole nationwide union will be allowed to shape its
internal organizations freely. The draft was not questioned and was
accepted,'' said Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the leader of the opposition
delegation to the talks.
   At a meeting with students at the Gdansk Polytechnic on Friday,
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said that ``Until now I am satisfied
with the discussions and with the fact that all (sides) agree about
the necessity of reforms. But I feel a lack of political decisions.''
   Walesa said he has asked his advisers and Solidarity negotiators
to provide a ``point by point'' list of the biggest stumbling blocks
that would require political decisions.
   Mazowiecki said more talks were needed on how to resolve
conflicts when rival unions form at the same enterprise.
   The official trade union alliance, OPZZ, proposed that disputes
between trade unions be the subject of a worker referendum, said the
leader of the OPZZ delegation, Romuald Sosnowski, on state
television.
   At a news conference, Mazowiecki said only the most important
issues should be put to a referendum and that the OPZZ proposal
seemed ``demagogic.''
   ``Let's hope that despite everything, it's only the difficult
beginning of trade union pluralism and that we will push forward at
the next meeting,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Th government has made it clear that Solidarity will be legalized
only if the opposition accepts a whole package of political and
eocnomic reforms.
   The talks began Feb. 6 and are expected to last six weeks.
   Solidarity was born in the labor turmoil of 1980, the first free
union in the Soviet bloc, then suppressed and outlawed after the
declaration of martial law in December 1981.
   Also Friday, at least 25 people were arrested during in Warsaw
and the southern city of Krakow.
   Several hundred people gathered in Krakow's market square to
protest the beating of demonstrators during a Feb. 17 rally against
political indoctrination in schools, said rally spokesman Adam
Slomka.
   Police used water cannons and tear gas to break up the protest,
he said.
   Ten people were arrested, he said. Two people were taken away in
an ambulance and several others were beaten, said a student activist
who declined identification.
   In Warsaw, police arrested at least 15 supporters of the ``Orange
Alternative,'' an independent group founded in the southwestern city
of Wroclaw that has attracted attention for its satirical street
events mocking authority.
   A crowd of several hundred people watched as members painted
store windows and the street with bright orange paint.

   Television cameras, normally barred from
federal courtrooms, have been used to record U.S. Court of Military
Appeals proceedings in what a group of news organizations hopes will
be the start of a trend.
   The TV cameras and sound equipment were operating for two hours
Thursday as lawyers argued the constitutionality of drug tests for
military personnel.
   The almost unprecedented presence of the equipment was authorized
by the three-judge court on a request by 13 news organizations,
including the four major television networks.
   Timothy Dyk, a lawyer representing the organizations, said the
results were encouraging.
   ``Everybody was very excited about it and pleased with the
results and the quality of the pictures,'' he said.
   Dyk said the filming, which will be broadcast at a later date,
was done without enhanced lighting and using the court's own sound
system.
   Dyk said he believed it was the first time TV cameras have been
used to record proceedings in any federal court. But some years ago
a federal judge in Roanoke, Va., permitted cameras in his courtroom.
   A demonstration of television cameras in court was conducted by
Dyk last November for three Supreme Court justices. That was a trial
run _ not a live court proceeding _ aimed at winning support from
the high court for the idea.
   While nearly all states allow some televised state court
coverage, the federal courts have remained adamant in banning
cameras from the courtroom.
   Dyk said the military appeals court is not covered by those
rules, adopted by the U.S. Judicial Conference, which helps
administer the federal court system.
   The U.S. Court of Military Appeals is a civilian appellate court
with jurisdiction over the military justice system.
   Two cameras were used to record Thursday's proceedings. One was
focused on the three judges hearing the case and was manned by a
cameraman. The second camera was unmanned and was placed at the side
of the judges' bench to focus on the lawyers.
   Dyk said there are no plans for the next step in the campaign to
change the policy against televised federal court proceedings.
   But he said those present Thursday felt there was no disruption.
   ``We talked to the judges and counsel afterward and they say they
saw no problem with it,'' Dyk said. ``One lawyer said he was
nervous, but because his wife was there.''

   The new constitution approved by Algerian voters
will increase civil liberties and usher in a new era of democracy in
this once staunchly socialist nation, the interior minister said
Friday.
   More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday's
balloting voted in favor of the new constitution, according to
results announced by the Interior Ministry on Friday.
   About 80 percent of the North African nation's 13 million voters
cast ballots, the ministry said, clearing the way for a multi-party
political system for the first time since independence from France
in 1962.
   Interior Minister Aboubakr Belkaid said the new constitution will
allow his country ``to know more democracy, to assure public and
individual liberties and to establish the sovereignty of the law.''
   He said it ``opens the way to a new era'' in multiple-party
politics.
   The new charter continues the political and social reforms
promised by President Chadli Bendjedid after a week of
anti-government riots in October left at least 176 people dead.
   Parliament in the coming weeks is expected to consider a set of
measures governing the operation of political parties and an
electoral code.
   Most Algerians welcomed the reforms, but Islamic fundamentalists,
who have already begun organizing a political association, had
reservations.
   Islamic leader Ali Bel-Hadj said fellow Moslems could not support
a pluralistic system that was in ``conflict with the ideology and
contradicted the beliefs of our people.''
   Thursday was the third time in less than four months that
Algerians were asked to vote. In November, voters approved a set of
political reforms that reduced the influence of the country's single
party, the National Liberation Front.
   In December, about 81 percent of the voters elected Benjedid, 59,
to lead the country of 25 million for a third five-year term.
   October's violent unrest was blamed on an economy battered by
falling world oil prices. Algeria derives 95 percent of its export
revenue from oil.
   Algerians blamed the centralized, socialist government for
failing to solve the economic problems behind high unemployment, a
shortage of goods, inadequate housing and a general decline in
living standards.
   Although it does not specifically authorize competing political
parties, the new constitution declares ``the right to create
associations of a political character,'' and several have already
been formed in anticipation of the reform.
   The new constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and,
within limits, the right to strike. It restricts the army to
defending the ``national independence, the unity and territorial
integrity of the country.''
   Under the old charter, the army had a role in ``development of
the country and the building of socialism.''
   The new text does not refer to socialism. The old constitution
declared that ``the Algerian state is socialist.''
   Islam remains the state religion and Arabic the official language.

   Unusually cold weather for Florida caught
network television by surprise Friday, and citrus growers and
vegetable farmers braced for a second night of arctic air.
   Except for a potato crop in north Florida and some strawberry
losses, most fruit and vegetables made it through Thursday night's
first frosty blast of the winter without much trouble as a blustery,
bone-chilling cold wave swept the length of the peninsula Thursday
and early Friday.
   And unlike states to the north which had snow-covered highways,
the snow that blew across Florida's northern tier from the Panhandle
to Jacksonville was just enough to amaze people before it melted.
   Police reported a minor traffic jam in Jacksonville Thursday
afternoon when drivers stopped along a major thoroughfare to watch
snow fall _ the first flurries there since March 1, 1986.
   ``I've never seen it snow that hard here,'' said Pat Jones of
Fort Walton Beach, in the Panhandle. ``Maybe it has snowed longer,
but I've never seen it come down that hard. It lasted about five
minutes, was very thick and very gray.''
   Cities as far south as Miami had record lows in the 30s Friday
morning.
   The chilly weather at Miami Beach, which had a low of 39, forced
the crew and stars of NBC's ``Today'' show indoors to the Carlyle
Hotel. The program had moved to Miami to boost a local affiliate and
to show some warm weather to the rest of the shivering nation.
   Snowbirds _ Northerners who move south for the winter _ gathered
outside the hotel, bundled up in sweaters and coats to get a glimpse
of Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel.
   Nelson Sheinker, a retiree from Montreal, said the cool
temperatures at the beach didn't bother him. ``We're used to it.
It's not that bad,'' he said.
   Dick Wallace of Erie, Pa., was not complaining either.
   ``This is 50 degrees warmer than the place we just left,'' he
said.
   Anyway, Wallace said, the Today people shouldn't have been
surprised: ``A week ago (``Today'' show weatherman) Willard Scott
warned us it would be cold.''
   Temperatures early Saturday were predicted in the teens and low
20s, meaning a hard freeze or frost all the way into lush citrus-and
vegetable-growing areas of central and southern Florida.
   ``It's going to be colder than last night,'' said forecaster
Emmett Ricks.
   There were scattered reports of damage to peaches and
strawberries. But farmers in the heart of strawberry country, Plant
City near Tampa, said cloud cover kept temperatures just above
freezing and saved the fragile crop just one week before the annual
Plant City Strawberry Festival.
   ``The timing couldn't be worse,'' said Cheryl Meeks of Plant
City. ``Strawberries are at their prime. The fields and plants are
loaded; they're just hanging there.''
   Dick Whalley, a spokesman for the state's billion-dollar citrus
industry, said temperatures Thursday and Friday were not low enough
for long enough periods to cause any damage anywhere in the citrus
belt.
   Reggie Brown, spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable
Association, said, ``Basically most of the industry got by without
any significant problem.''
   One exception was a crop of early-spring potatoes in the
Hastings-Palatka area. The spuds had grown larger than normal
because of the unusually warm weather of the past few weeks, and
they could not all be rebedded in time to escape freezing
temperatures Thursday night, Brown said. The extent of damage was
unknown.

   The Navy on Friday suspended three men from
doing business with the federal government in a move stemming from
the long-running investigation of defense contract fraud.
   Two of the men, Robert D. Barrett and Joseph E. Hill, were
suspended as a result of their guilty pleas on Jan. 27 to making
illegal campaign contributions to members of Congress.
   The third man, Wilborn J. Sanda, was suspended ``based upon
previously released affidavit information pertaining to his conduct
as a consultant to defense contractors,'' the Navy said.
   Barrett, a former executive at Unisys Corp., a giant computer
company that does work for the Defense Department, and Hill, a
consultant paid by Unisys, have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
as part of a plea arrangement.
   The pleas were part of the federal government's two-year-old
investigation into the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement
practices. The case includes allegations that private consultants,
hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagon officials to obtain
inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts.

   The Bush administration's proposal for a $5
billion reduction in Medicare next fiscal year appeared Friday to be
going nowhere.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said he wouldn't support the proposed reduction, which
was also turned down by the House Ways and Means Committee the day
before.
   ``The idea that we can save some $5 billion, I think, is
unacceptable,'' said Bentsen, whose committee has jurisdiction on
the Senate side over the federal health insurance program for the
elderly.
   Medicare costs have been growing rapidly as the number of elderly
Americans increases and as the prices of medical services rise
faster than the general rate of inflation.
   This year's Medicare costs of $84.5 billion would grow to $97.5
next year without restraints. Bush, however, proposed to hold the
program to $92.5 billion in fiscal 1990 by limiting payments to
hospitals and doctors who treat Medicare patients and by trimming
supplementary payments to teaching hospitals.
   Bentsen, however, said the financial strain on many hospitals
would not withstand the proposed cut, which would shave more than
$3.5 billion from Medicare payments to hospitals.
   ``The numbers we're looking at now ... (indicate) many are at the
break-even point and this is further complicated by the substantial
number of hospitals that have had to close their doors and haven't
been able to make ends meet,'' Bentsen said.
   ``A reduction of that amount is excessive and we'd be going too
far,'' he said.
   The chairman declined to say how much of a savings he would be
willing to support.
   The Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the
program on the House side, said in a report Thursday that ``it is
not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the
level of reductions proposed by the administration in the Medicare
program for fiscal year 1990.''

   The mayor's office has been held by Democrats for
half a century and that's unlikely to change this year, but a GOP
write-in candidate may throw a small monkey wrench into the
opposition works in Tuesday's primary.
   At the very least, the outnumbered Republicans got a moment in
the spotlight when, with less than a week to go, flashy former
Democrat Edward Vrdolyak made his write-in bid official Wednesday.
   Democratic frontrunner Richard M. Daley, the Cook County
prosecutor and son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, and acting
Mayor Eugene Sawyer say they expect little impact on their contest,
though some observers say Vrdolyak's bid on the GOP side could
siphon off some of Daley's white ethnic votes.
   Herbert Sohn, the GOP candidate endorsed by the Cook County
party, says he'll whip Vrdolyak hands down.
   Alderman Timothy Evans, who like Sawyer is black, will take on
the Democratic and GOP primary winners as a third-party candidate in
the April 4 special general election.
   Analysts say Vrdolyak is a long-shot for the GOP nomination, and
that odds are even worse for a Republican winner in April. The
party's last mayor, William Hale ``Big Bill'' Thompson, lost his
1931 re-election bid.
   In a radio-show recording session, Vrdolyak said he hopes to win
10,000 votes; that amount could guarantee him the nomination in this
Democratic stronghold and is half what he got from his ward in a
failed 1987 mayoral bid.
   His big challenge Tuesday will be to get people to properly write
in votes with punch-card voting machines, said Paul Green, a
professor at Governors State University in suburban University Park
who follows city politics.
   ``It's physically very difficult to have legal write-ins on a
punch-card system,'' Green said.
   But Vrdolyak showed he can still draw a crowd at Wednesday's
rally, where a multiracial crowd cheered him on and supporters said
they had more than 50,000 signatures on petitions drafting him for
the race.
   Vrdolyak switched parties after resigning from City Council and
giving up his post as chairman of the powerful Cook County
Democratic Party to mount his third-party challenge to Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor, two years ago.
   Sohn, 61, shares the Republican ballot with former GOP
committeeman Kenneth Hurst, 62, and a businessman who has been
accused of writing an anti-Semitic and racist tract, William J.
Grutzmacher, 58.

<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities said Friday that a
Swiss-based currency trading company may have been involved in a
massive money-laundering scandal involving drugs in the United
States.
   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement that the possible role of
the Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading A.G. of Zurich was
revealed during the ``largest drug money laundering investigation
ever conducted by U.S. law enforcement agencies.''
   ``Among many aspects revealed by this investigation in New York
was the fact that a bank account maintained there by the Shakarchi
Trading Company in Zurich may have been involved in transactions
with some of the targets '' of the probe, the statement said.
   Shakarchi Trading A.G. is headed by a Lebanese, Mohammed
Shakarchi. Its vice president until last Oct. 27 was Hans W. Kopp,
the husband of former Swiss Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp.
   Mrs. Kopp resigned last month after admitting she tipped her
husband off that the company might come under scrutiny by Swiss
authorities.
   The company's name has been mentioned in connection with a probe
launched by a Swiss prosecutor into the origins of more than $2
billion allegedly transferred to Switzerland by two Lebanese
brothers, Jean and Barkev Magharian. Both are being held in Lugano,
southern Switzerland, on suspicion of fraud.
   Mohammed Shakarchi, a business contact of the Magharians, has
denied any part in drug money laundering. Swiss prosecutor Dick
Marty said in a report this month that Shakarchi told investigators
he had warned a manager of Credit Suisse, the counrty's third
largest commercial bank, that funds deposited by the Magharians with
the bank were of doubtful origin.
   Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova told reporters Friday
Swiss authorities were examining whether judicial proceedings can be
opened against the Shakarchi company. He said the company's New York
account contained $500,000 believed by investigators to be drug
money.
   The U.S. Embassy's news release said that during the U.S. probe,
code-named ``Operation Polar Cap,'' it emerged that the U.S.
government had in the past purchased foreign currency from the
Shakarchi Trading company.
   But it said ``these past legitimate purchases have no known
bearing on any aspect of this or any other criminal investigation.''
   Money laundering is not punishable in Switzerland unless the
funds are used for criminal purposes. Legislation to make it a
criminal offense is being drafted.

   Republican Party leaders completed action
Friday on a resolution denouncing former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke
and denying him any financial or technical assistance from the
national party.
   ``What makes a Republican is not the approval of some backroom
committee, but the approval of the voters who elected me,'' Duke
said when told of the action.
   The resolution was adopted unanimously by a telephone vote of the
11 members of the party's executive committee.
   Duke was elected as a Republican to the Louisiana House of
Representatives Saturday despite appeals by President Bush and
former President Reagan on behalf of his GOP opponent, John Treen.
   After Duke's election, he was denounced by Republican Party
Chairman Lee Atwater and Bush indicated his only regret about
opposing Duke was that it might have helped him.
   ``Mr. Atwater cannot take away me being a Republican nor can this
committee,'' said Duke. ``As far as not giving me any money or
technical assistance, I didn't need any money or technical
assistance to win this race and I won't need any money or technical
assistance to win any future races I may be involved in.''
   The opposition of national party leaders had little impact on
Republican legislators in Louisiana, who welcomed Duke into their
ranks when he was sworn in on Wednesday.
   Leslie Goodman, a spokesman for the national party, said the vote
was conducted over the last two days.
   She said a copy of the resolution was not available because party
lawyers were refining its language.
   However, a proposed resolution, made public late last week,
denounced the former Klan leader, saying that Duke ``may be a
Republican in party registration but he is not a Republican in
gesture, deed or belief.''
   The resolution described Duke as a former ``grand dragon of the
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the founder of the National
Association for the Advancement of White People, which embraces
views antithetical to the Republican Party;
   ``Secondly, Duke and these groups preach doctrines of racial,
religious and ethnic hatred, bigotry and discrimination against
American citizens which are abhorrent to the American tradition and
have no place in the Republican Party.''

<HEAD>Effort to Draft Jesse Jackson for Mayor of D.C. is Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the city school board and a leader
of the Statehood Party of the District of Columbia said Friday they
plan to organize a campaign seeking to draft civil rights activist
Jesse Jackson to run for mayor next year.
   R. Calvin Lockridge, a school board member, and Tom Chorlton, a
Statehood Party leader, told The Associated Press they are planning
to organize the draft-Jackson drive, expected to center on gathering
petition signatures.
   They said Jackson, who made unsuccessful bids for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 and recently denied being
interested in seeking the mayor's office, had no knowledge of their
plans.
   Jackson, who has owned a home in northwest Washington since 1984,
and embattled Mayor Marion Barry Jr., a Democrat who was first
elected in 1978 and has not announced whether he will seek a fourth
four-year term in 1990, were not immediately available for comment.
   However, after leading an anti-drug rally at a local high school
two weeks ago, Jackson said: ``I've expressed no interest in the
job.'' He added that ``under no condition would I run against Marion
Barry.''
   ``We want to show Jackson that he should express interest in the
job,'' said Lockridge. ``Barry has not decided what he will do, but
I think this movement will help him come to the right decision. For
now, we're just asking Jesse to listen to what the voters will have
to say.''
   ``The district is suffering a crisis in spirit,'' Chorlton said.
``We need a leader _ Jesse Jackson _ who can pull people together
toward something positive.''
   Barry has been trying to deal with a drug-related crime wave in
the city, and has appeared before a federal grand jury investigating
his ties to a drug suspect. He has repeatedly denied using drugs or
knowingly being associated with drug dealers or users.
   Under city law, Jackson could qualify for the 1990 election by
switching his voter registration from Chicago to the district by
November 1989.

   Police in Bombay, India, opened fire Friday on Moslem mobs
protesting ``The Satanic Verses,'' killing up to 12 people, and an
Iranian leader said the novel might cause a ``vast battle'' between
Iran and the West.
   Officials in London said Britain asked Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze to press the Iranian patriarch, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, to lift his command that followers kill Salman
Rushdie, author of the novel Moslems call blasphemous.
   News reports said police gunfire wounded 40 people during the
Bombay protest by about 5,000 people after midday Moslem prayers and
that 11 police officers were injured. Police said they arrested 300
demonstrators.
   The protesters ignored a ban on assembly of more than five people
in public places Friday, the Moslem sabbath. A police spokesman said
they set fire to several buses and other vehicles and attacked
police.
   Police imposed the ban after some Moslems announced plans to
demonstrate against the book, which they say is blasphemous.
   Reports of the death toll conflicted. Press Trust said 12 people
were killed, United News of India put it at 10, and Police
Commissioner S.M. Shangari said eight had died. Two deaths initially
attributed to the violence were caused by unrelated road accidents,
he said.
   Demonstrations also were reported in the Indian cities of New
Delhi, Calcutta, Darjeeling, Varanasi, Patna and Siliguri. No
violence was reported.
   In New Delhi, about 400 Moslems marched to the British Embassy,
and the city's 32-officer police force was put on alert.
   India banned Rushdie's book in November, fearing it could spark
sectarian unrest. More than 90 million Moslems live in India and
make up about 11 percent of the nation's population of 880 million.
The novel also is banned in Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran
and Egypt.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay in 1947. Now a
British citizen, he has been under police guard in England since
Khomeini first ordered Moslems on Feb. 14 to kill him. Iranian
clerics have put a $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head.
   In demonstrations Feb. 12-13, one person was killed in India and
six died in Pakistan, where police opened fire on a crowd that
attacked a U.S. diplomatic office.
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, urged Western
countries to state clearly if they agree with the contents of
Rushdie's novel.
   Rafsanjani said Moslems want to know if Western governments
support what the book says about Islam ``so that we know what our
duty is regarding those who are a partner in cursing the prophet.''
   ``The ground has been laid for a vast battle between Islam on the
one hand, and paganism and arrogance on the other,'' Rafsanjani said
in the prayer sermon in Tehran, broadcast by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency and monitored in Cyprus.
   British Foreign Office sources said Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe had written Shevardnadze urging him to tell Khomeini
that ``the Soviet Union shares the international community's wish to
see Iran respect international obligations and renounce the use of
violence.''
   Shevardnadze, on a 10-day Middle East tour, will meet with
Khomeini on Saturday in a rare audience with the religious patriarch.
   The Soviet Ambassador to London, Leonid Zamyatin, said the
controversy ``clearly shows the need for respect for religious
feelings and traditions as well as tolerance for the politics and
values of others.''
   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community have recalled
their envoys from Iran, and London has shut down its mission in
Tehran. Iran pulled its ambassadors out of the Common Market nations.
   Nearly 2,000 Moslems rallied in Manchester in northern Britain on
Friday and called for Rushdie's book to be withdrawn from library
shelves. They waved placards and ripped a cardboard effigy of
Rushdie to pieces.
   Britain's home secretary, Douglas Hurd, said his country's
750,000 Moslems were entitled to protest ``peacefully and with
dignity'' against a book ``which they believe denigrates and insults
the prophet of Islam.''
   ``But to turn such protests toward violence or the threat of
violence is wholly unacceptable,'' he told a meeting of Moslems in
Birmingham.
   Howe, in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, was
threatened with death by a man who called the Tokyo correspondent
for Britain's Guardian newspaper and said Howe ``won't leave Tokyo
alive. ... He is a great infidel like Rushdie,'' the newspaper said.
   In Istanbul, a man called The Associated Press and said U.S.
embassies would be bombed. He said he spoke in the name of ``Islamic
Jihad for the Honor of Islam.'' Another caller said a bomb was
placed at the British Council office in Istanbul but no bomb was
found, police said. Istanbul Governor Cahit Bayar said security
precautions were taken at foreign missions in the city. He did not
elaborate.
   Some Moslem priests in Turkey denounced Rushdie during their
Friday sermons and one said he should be killed, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
   Many people in the predominantly Moslem country have said they
disapprove of ``The Satanic Verses,'' but others have opposed
Khomeini's death threat.

   Police opened fire Friday during violent
protests against ``The Satanic Verses'' in author Salman Rushdie's
native city, killing up to 12 people and injuring 40, according to
news reports.
   At least 5,000 Moslems chanting ``Allahu Akbar!'' (God is Great)
gathered in central Bombay after midday prayers. Mobs set fire to
buses and other vehicles and attacked several officers, said a
policeman on duty at Bombay headquarters.
   He said police arrested 300 protesters. The news agency Press
Trust of India said at least 11 policemen were injured.
   Other protests of the novel, which Moslems say blasphemes their
religion, occurred in New Delhi, Calcutta and four other Indian
cities, United News of India and Press Trust reported.
   Reports on the number of deaths in Bombay conflicted. Press Trust
of India said 12 people were killed, United News of India said 10
and Police Commissioner S.M. Shangari put the total at eight.
Shangari said two deaths initially attributed to the violence were
caused by road accidents during the protests.
   New Delhi's 32,000-member police force was put on alert, a
spokesman said, because ``the Bombay incidents have forced us to
think that it may be the real beginning of a problem.''
   More than 90 million Moslems live in India, a predominantly Hindu
country of 880 million.
   Protesters in Bombay ignored a police ban on the assembly of more
than five people in public place Friday, the Moslem Sabbath. The ban
was imposed after some Moslems announced plans to protest the book.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay in 1947. He now
lives in London.
   At least one person was killed in India during a similar
demonstration Feb. 13, the day after six were killed Feb. 12 in
neighboring Pakistan, where police fired on protesters who tried to
set the U.S. Information Agency office in Islamabad ablaze to
protest publication of the book in the United States.

   Thousands of World War II veterans gathered across
Britain _ some in prayer services, some in pubs _ to remember
comrades killed by Japanese soldiers in the name of Emperor Hirohito.
   In meetings and protests that stretched from Britain to Hong
Kong, South Korea and Japan, some vented their anger at Japan's
wartime leader, and others even celebrated his death.
   Protesters in South Korea burned Japanese flags in two cities,
North Korea denounced Hirohito as an ``inveterate enemy of the
Korean people'' and British veterans in Hong Kong marched with
placards saying ``Hirohito was a war criminal'' and ``Down with
Japanese imperialism.''
   In Britain, elderly ex-soldiers and former prisoners of war held
more than 25 services at war memorials and in churches to coincide
with the emperor's grand state funeral.
   ``Our purpose is to remember those of our colleagues who suffered
as a result of Hirohito's army,'' said Harold Payne, president of
the Far East Prisoner of War Association, whose 68 chapters
organized the services.
   Some veterans were angry that Queen Elizabeth II's husband,
Prince Philip, joined world leaders at ceremonies in Tokyo and that
he made a slight bow of the head at the emperor's coffin and to the
new emperor, Akihito.
   A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the bow was ``a formal and
entirely usual act of courtesy to a reigning sovereign.''
   But Payne said before a London church service that drew 1,000
people, ``It's also in our minds ... that by all these dignitaries
going to the Far East, the Japanese will think they're exonerated
from blame.''
   At the service, Payne refused to speak to a reporter from the
Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, Akahata, and said he asked the
reporter to leave.
   Many of those taking part were among the 52,000 British and
Australian prisoners held under brutal conditions after the fall of
Singapore in 1942. Many had worked on the ``Death Railway,'' the
supply line between Burma and Thailand whose construction cost
16,000 lives.
   During the service at London's Church of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields, one ex-POW spoke of forgiveness.
   ``If we ... allow bitterness and hatred to dominate our lives it
will lead to self-destruction,'' Maj. Lawrence Smith said.
   But Peter Dunstan, a 68-year-old former Royal Marine who had been
captured in Singapore, said in an interview at the church, ``We're
going to the local pub to celebrate putting that so-and-so six foot
under where he should have been long ago.''
   In Seoul, South Korea, riot police with shields dispersed about
70 protesters who tried to march to the Japanese protests. Police
took 10 marchers into custody. Protesters denounced Hirohito as
``mankind's biggest war criminal'' and burned Japanese flags in
rallies in Seoul and Pusan.
   During 36 years of Japanese rule, allegiance to the emperor was
demanded of all Koreans, who also were ordered to adopt Japanese
names and speak Japanese.
   ``The arch crimes Hirohito had committed against our nation have
not yet been paid off,'' the North Korean government newspaper Minju
Chosun said.
   In Japan, about 5,190 people turned out for 71 anti-emperor
demonstrations across the country, and 12 people were arrested,
National Police Agency spokesman Hiroshi Arakawa said.
   The bitterness comes despite a view generally held by historians
that Hirohito was only a titular leader with little political power.
   Others, while bitter, did not want to think about the emperor
anymore.
   ``No way was this funeral going to overshadow the memory of the
lads,'' said Reginald Dunne, vice president of the national ex-POW
association and organizer of a service attended by 600 in the
northern England city of Blackpool.

   A federal appeals court on Friday refused to
grant a new hearing in the partial merger of two Detroit newspapers
but continued to block the transaction to give opponents a chance
for further appeal.
   The 5-4 decision left the Supreme Court as the only avenue of
appeal for a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers who have
sought to halt the joint operating agreement between The Detroit
News and the Detroit Free Press.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected a
petition, filed by the 500-member Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, for a hearing by the full court.
   A three-judge appeals panel in January had said the newspapers
were entitled to a partial exemption from federal antitrust laws and
could merge business and production departments.
   The court said its stay delaying the partial merger ``shall
remain in effect until 5 p.m. EST on March 6, 1989, to afford
appellants an opportunity to apply to the Supreme Court for a stay
beyond that date.''
   The Washington-based advocacy group Public Citizen, which is
handling the legal work for Michigan Citizens, said opponents would
decide by Wednesday whether to ask the Supreme Court to take the
case. Attorney Bill Schultz said: ``I think the fact that it was 5-4
shows we were right, we had a strong shot.''
   The News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press, owned by
Knight-Ridder Inc., in 1986 asked permission for the partial merger
in order to keep the Free Press from going out of business.
   Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the application
last year, and opponents began appeals.
   Under the proposed agreement, Gannett would initially take 55
percent of the joint operation's profits or losses, and after six
years the split would become 50-50 for the next 94 years.
   The newspapers would retain separate news and editorial
departments.
   The majority opinion opposing a rehearing, written by Judge
Laurence Silberman, argued that cost-cutting by the newspapers was
irrelevant to the case.
   ``Congress authorized the attorney general to prevent a city
newspaper editorial monopoly _ even at the risk of a shared economic
monopoly _ because it thought the unusual economics of the newspaper
industry compelled that exception to the antitrust laws,'' Silberman
wrote. ``Otherwise, one newspaper may achieve a stunning fusion of
economic and editorial _ political _ power due to the loss of actual
and potential competition.''
   The dissenting opinion, written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald,
said the attorney general had accepted the premise that one of the
newspapers cut prices to eliminate a rival.
   ``Where ... two independent papers can compete legally and stay
alive, condoning resort by one to pricing which on the record is
hard to distinguish from illegal predatory pricing in order to
secure a monopoly protected by a JOA will, ironically, make it even
more probable that newspapers will disappear,'' Wald wrote.
   ``We have taken another vital step toward knowing there will be a
strong future for this newspaper,'' said Free Press Publisher David
Lawrence. ``We are getting there, but after almost three years of
this process, we will not breathe comfortably until all of this is
finally behind us.
   ``It is time for everybody's lives to go on. I would hope that
everyone, including opponents, would agree enough is enough.''
   ``We are gratified by the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals
not to rehear the Detroit JOA case,'' James K. Batten, president of
Miami-based Knight-Ridder, said in a statement released in Detroit.
``We will be consulting as soon as possible with our attorneys and
officials at Gannett to plan our next moves.''
   Officials of Arlington, Va.-based Gannett declined to comment on
the court's decision.

<TEXT>
   Nearly a week after the number for a $16
million lottery was picked, the winner of the multistate contest's
largest jackpot has come forward, lottery officials said Friday.
   The winner, whose name was not disclosed, will appear Sunday at a
news conference in the District of Columbia with the director of the
D.C. lottery, Lotto America officials said.
   The lone winning ticket for the game's largest prize, picked in
the Feb. 18 drawing, was sold at a mini-mart in Washington.
   There was no indication why the winner waited almost a week to
claim the prize.
   It's the first time that anyone outside of Iowa or Kansas has won
the multistate lottery game, which began about a year ago. The
previous record jackpot, $13.6 million, was claimed by a Norwalk,
Iowa, couple in December.
   The winner has one year from the date of the drawing to claim the
prize, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State
Lottery Association, which oversees the game. If the $16 million had
remained unclaimed, it would have been divided among the states in
the Lotto America game, according to the percentage of sales in each
place for that jackpot, Strutt said.
   Other states participating in Lotto America are Missouri, Oregon,
West Virginia and Rhode Island.
   The winning numbers were 9, 17, 20, 28, 46 and 50.
   After taxes are withheld, the winner will receive about $600,000
per year for 20 years.
   The estimated jackpot for Saturday night's Lotto America drawing
is $3 million.

<HEAD>Investigators Clear Hospital In Treatment Of 11-Year-Old Pregnant
Girl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital that transferred an
11-year-old girl who was five months pregnant with twins to another
hospital violated no federal or state law, officials said Friday.
   One of the fetuses was stillborn, the other, which weighed 9
ounces, died shortly after it was delivered later that day.
   The case came under investigation when Tallahassee Memorial
Medical Center filed a report, as required by the new state law,
about the transfer.
   Tallahassee Memorial and Tallahassee Community Hospital, which
transfered the girl, disagreed on whether the girl was in labor at
the time.
   Rheb Harbison, a spokesman for Tallahassee Community, said the
case was a ``classic medical nightmare.''
   ``But once you look beyond the shock of it and ask yourself
whether or not appropriate medical care was delivered you would have
to conclude, as both the federal and the state governments have,
that it was,'' he said Friday.
   The child walked into Tallahassee Community on Jan. 9,
accompanied by her grandmother and complaining of indigestion,
Harbison said.
   A doctor determined she was five months pregnant with twins, and
that one of the babies was in a breech position, Harbison said.
   ``She was not in labor when she presented at the hospital but she
was clearly having problems with her pregnancy,'' he said.
   The doctor decided to transfer the child by ambulance to nearby
Tallahassee Memorial. Unlike Tallahassee Community, Tallahassee
Memorial has a specialist in premature births on duty around the
clock, Harbison said.
   The child was upset and did not follow directions to keep her
legs together to prevent her amniotic sac from dropping further, he
said. The doctor put two strips of tape on top of the girl's thighs
to remind her.
   ``In no way whatsoever were her legs immobilized or bound or
wrapped or any other of the descriptions that have been floating
about,'' said Harbison.
   Harbison said his hospital received notification Thursday from
the Health Care Financing Administration that federal investigators
found no evidence that the hospital had violated regulations
prohibiting hospitals from transferring indigent people to other
hospitals for emergency care.
   Federal rules specifically bar hospitals from tranferring women
or girls to another hospital if they are in labor.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services also
found no evidence that Tallahassee Community violated a state law
prohibiting hospitals from questionning patients needing emergency
care before deciding treatment, according to Steve Konicki, an HRS
spokesman.
   Ron Brafford, senior vice president at Tallahassee Memorial, said
Friday that officials at his hospital thought the girl was in labor
when she arrived and ``that's what constituted a violation.''
   Community officials acknowledged that the girl should not have
been sent alone in the ambulance for the two-mile trip, and said a
nurse will accompany any patients transferred in the future.

   The first U.N. human rights report on Cuba,
released Friday, said Cuban prisoners complained of torture but that
Fidel Castro's government denied mistreating them.
   A six-member team that spent 10 days in Cuba in September
compiled the 400-page report and the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
which includes 43 nations, will begin discussing it Tuesday.
   In their report, the investigators said they received more than
1,600 complaints of human rights violations, including 137 of
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
   The torture allegations were in a letter signed by 22 political
prisoners and handed to two U.N. representatives who visited
Combinado del Este prison in Havana.
   It said: ``The Cuban tormentors, advised by experts in political
repression, mainly Russians and Czechs, inflict all kinds of
torture.''
   Gen. Jose Abrantes, Cuba's interior minister, told the U.N.
representatives ``a number of detainees or prisoners had in the past
been beaten'' but those responsible had been punished, their report
said.
   ``He said there are no cases of torture,'' the report said.
   Most of the complaints _ 1,183 _ were from Cubans who declared it
``difficult to leave the country either temporarily or
permanently,'' the investigators reported.
   Cuba has said 20,000 Cubans could leave for the United States
each year under an agreement with Washington. During the first nine
months of 1988 only 5,932 had gone, however, and the report quoted
Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez as blaming U.S.
``non-compliance.''
   Much of the report was devoted to statistics suggesting a great
improvement in education and health care since Castro's revolution
in 1959. It also quoted cultural figures as praising his literacy
campaign and promotion of cultural life.
   Ambassador Alioune Sene of Senegal led the U.N. team, whose other
members were from Bulgaria, Colombia, Ireland, Nigeria and the
Philippines.
   Washington says Cuba and North Korea are the world's worst human
rights offenders, and the United Nations should send investigators
to Cuba once a year as it does with such other countries as Chile,
South Africa and El Salvador.
   Castro's government has said it will not allow another visit.

<HEAD>Fire Destroys Half Of Remaining Brazilian Coastal Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>

   Firemen and volunteers on Friday
battled a 20-day fire that has destroyed tens of thousands of acres
of one of the country's most important wildlife preserves, officials
said.
   Firefighters have been unable to check the blaze, which began as
a series of brush fires throughout the northeastern coastal state of
Bahia, said Leonardo Martins da Rocha of the Brazilian Forestry
Institute. He spoke in a telephone interview from the rural town of
Eunapolis, about 651 miles northeast of Rio.
   ``The situation is extremely serious and worsening,'' said da
Rocha. ``The various fires are joining each other and are burning
day and night.''
   He said the fire, which has destroyed half of Brazil's Atlantic
Forest, has swept through more than 75,000 acres of the virgin
wilderness.
   The cause of the fire is not known. But local farmers often set
fire to their land at this time of the year to renew their pastures
or burn garbage, da Costa said.
   He blamed a two-month drought in the region and a lack of funds
from the Bahia state government for making the task of fighting the
blaze ``more than impossible.''
   ``I just saw two large plantations go up in smoke in a couple of
hours,'' da Costa said. ``We have teams of four trying to contain
the fire in spots because we have no money to work with. What fire
can you stop with four men?''
   Just 3 percent of the once-vast Atlantic Forest, which in the
16th century covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile
coastal strip, remains standing today.
   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found
nowhere else in the world, face extinction. Among them is the
Pau-Brasil, the tree that gave the country its name.
   Fires also have broken out recently and raged uncontrolled in the
northern Amazon jungle.
   Environmentalists and some scientists have warned that the smoke
is increasing world pollution and contributing to the ``greenhouse
effect,'' or warming of the earth's atmosphere.

   A ``nor'easter'' blizzard battered the East Coast with wind and
snow Friday, lashing the sea into 30-foot waves, and the Deep South
shivered with unaccustomed temperatures in the teens that iced
highways and froze early spring blossoms.
   Temperatures dropped to record lows at 35 cities from the Great
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico as arctic air surged southward. Miami
hit a record low of 37, equalling the temperature at Minot, N.D.
   The chilly weather at Miami Beach, which had a low of 39, forced
NBC's ``Today'' show indoors to the Carlyle Hotel. The show had
moved south to boost a local affiliate and show some warm weather to
a shivering nation.
   Slippery roads were blamed for hundreds of accidents and schools
were closed from Georgia to New Jersey. Three weather-related deaths
were reported.
   ``All the roads are covered, we've got ice, and people are
wrecking right and left,'' said Officer Dennis Anders of the
Alleghany County, N.C., Sheriff's Department.
   The storm dumped 6 to 12 inches of snow across southeastern
Virginia and wind gusted to 60 mph, said Terry Ritter, chief
meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Norfolk. He said
it was the region's first storm classified as a blizzard since 1980.
   The wind generated waves up to 12 feet on Chesapeake Bay and
20-foot waves were reported on the Atlantic Ocean, Coast Guard
officials said.
   The Navy cut back on all but essential services, and delayed the
departure of seven Norfolk-based ships that had been scheduled to
sail Friday morning to the North Atlantic or a three-week exercise.
   ``The problem is visibility. There is none,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet.
   The storm veered northeastward and snow began falling on
Massachusetts' Cape Cod by late morning while its wind was felt at
sea.
   A Coast Guard cutter raced most of the day to reach a disabled
fishing trawler with five men aboard fighting snow and 30-foot seas
50 miles off Chatham, Mass.
   The 270-foot cutter Escanaba reached the 75-foot trawler Paul and
Dominic, based in Gloucester, Mass., and began towing it south with
the wind behind it, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason.
   ``It's very dangerous,'' Mason said. ``Seas are between 20 and 30
feet, which is monstrous. Visibility is real limited, with snow.''
   Temperatures fell into the teens across parts of Mississippi,
Alabama and Georgia _ with wind chills below zero _ just over a week
after record highs in the 70s and 80s brought peach trees and
daffodils into premature bloom.
   Record lows included 16 degrees at Birmingham, Ala.; 19 at
Mobile, Ala., on the Gulf Coast; and 28 at New Orleans. Atlanta tied
its record of 17. Grand Rapids, Mich., hit a record 9 below zero.
   Shelters in Birmingham, Ala., opened their doors to people
needing a warm place for the night. ``Anyone can come is as long as
they don't cause problems,'' said police community service officer
Alton Morgado.
   The cold was especially noticeable to tourists.
   ``It's probably warmer in New York,'' Kristin Horne, 28, said in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``I didn't bring any warm clothes to Florida.
We couldn't even go to the beach today and it looks like this
weekend we'll have to drink and stay warm somehow.''
   ``Hot chocolate sells really well when the weather gets cold,''
said Larry Barton, an assistant manager of a Publix supermarket in
Plantation, Fla. ``We can't keep it in stock.''
   Tourists in Florida should be happier after a warming trend
begins Saturday. It is expected to push temperatures into the 70s
statewide by Monday, said the National Weather Service.
   The snowstorm formed as a low pressure system off the coast of
the Carolinas. The storm center, spinning counterclockwise, raked
its wind across the coast out of the northeast, earning it the label
of a ``nor'easter.''
   Wind gusted to 59 mph near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and the state
shut down six of the seven ferries it operates along the coast.
   Blizzard conditions were reported along the Outer Banks islands
and in North Carolina's Gates and Hertford counties, where 18 inches
of snow and drifts to 3 feet were reported, the weather service said.
   Roads through North Carolina were covered with snow, up to 11
inches fell in parts of eastern Virginia and drifts 3 to 4 feet high
were reported in Delaware, the weather service said.
   ``Snow shovels and rock salt. Those are the two biggest sellers
at the moment,'' said Jennifer Tillman, an employee at Pleasants
Hardware in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``We sold out of sleds Saturday or
we'd be selling those, too.''
   Up to 9 inches of snow was measured at McKee City, N.J., with 8
inches at Margate and northern Cape May County, the weather service
said.
   ``The road crews are out in full force, but as soon as they plow,
the wind covers the road over again,'' said New Jersey State Police
Trooper Robert Roesch in Burlington County.
   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle ordered some state offices closed
Friday because of the storm.
   The cold threatened some crops in the South.
   At Plant City in central Florida, where an annual strawberry
festival is planned to open March 2, farmers struggled to shield
their plants.
   ``You know how your stomach feels when you think you could lose
everything you worked for? That's the feeling we're getting now,''
said Tommy Brock, whose fields are east of Plant City.
   However, cloud cover kept the temperature just above freezing at
Plant City, farmers said.
   Peach growers in Alabama burned tires and coal in orchards during
the night to protect trees against the cold, but there were
scattered reports of damage.
   Citrus growers in central Florida reported no problems Friday,
thanks partly to light wind that stirred up the air, but weather
service forecaster Emmett Ricks said Friday night was going to be
colder.
   Elsewhere in the South, flood-stricken Kentucky was declared a
major disaster area by President Bush Friday, making federal aid
available to affected people and local governments. The region was
hit by heavy rain and flooding beginning Feb. 13.

   The Central Bank's estimated 750 employees
declared a 24-hour strike Friday in Beirut and other cities to
protest a reported order by Premier Michel Aoun to prosecute bank
Gov. Edmond Naim for misuse of power.
   They threatened to extend the strike indefinitely unless charges
were dropped.
   Naim threatened to resign on Friday over the incident.
   Gen. Aoun, like Naim a Maronite Christian, is head of the
nation's Christian Cabinet.
   Lebanon's official radio said Naim faces charges that include
``misuse of authority, mismanagement and failure to control
manipulation in certain financial institutions.''
   The Central Bank handles the accounts of Lebanon's dual
governments, one headed by Aoun in Christian east Beirut and the
other by Salim Hoss in Moslem west Beirut. The bank was the only
government institution not divided by nearly 14 years of civil
strife.
   Naim told The Associated Press his resignation and those of two
of his deputies would be submitted to the two cabinets ``when the
time comes.''
   ``I don't know why they want to prosecute me. I'm ready to submit
my resignation,'' he said.
   The bank depends on cash flow on whatever income tax, excise and
customs duties the two governments can collect in Lebanon's
war-ravaged economy. Other sources of income include revenue from
government-owned properties, trade in foreign exchange and deposits
by commercial banks.
   Aoun was appointed to head an interim military Cabinet by
outgoing President Amin Gemayel last Sept. 22 after Parliament
failed to elect a new president. Syrian-backed Moslems rejected
Aoun's appointment and declared recognition only of Hoss' incumbent
Cabinet.

<HEAD>Blacks Announce Boycott To Protest Segregation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Blacks in the mining town of
Carletonville plan a consumer boycott and civil disobedience
campaign next week to protest the resegregation of public
facilities, union leaders said Friday.
   The boycott was sparked by the reintroduction of strict
segregation by the extreme-right Conservative Party, which took
control of the town council in last October's municipal elections.
   The council has voted to resegregate local facilities that had
been opened to all races and to build a fence to keep blacks off the
town hall's lawn. The council said last month it was considering a
curfew barring blacks from the town at night, but no action has been
taken.
   Carletonville, 45 miles southwest of Johannesburg, is one of
several dozen towns captured by the Conservatives last October.
   Local affiliates of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the country's largest black labor federation, said the Carletonville
boycott would begin Monday and would include demonstrations and a
sit-in at a park that recently was declared ``whites only.''
   A leader of Carletonville's town council, Koos Nel, said the
Conservative Party would not bow to pressure.
   ``If white businesses are affected, I will be the first to admit
I'm sorry, but I can't change,'' he said. ``If we give in once, then
what's coming next?''
   A black consumer boycott has been under way since December in the
industrial town of Boksburg, where the Conservative-controlled
council has resegregated public facilities.
   On Friday, Boksburg town councilors threatened to cut off the
electricity of Asians living illegally in ``whites-only'' areas.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party government has made no move
to halt the Boksburg boycott even though state-of-emergency
regulations prohibit the organization of such protests.
   The government has condemned the Conservative Party's
resegregation campaign, but has been accused of hypocrisy because it
has made no move to repeal the Separate Amenities Act, which allows
blacks to be barred from local facilities.
   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp. said Friday
that the act ``has caused problems at every level of South African
life.''
   ``On a personal level it results in a discrimination that was
intensely hurtful,'' an SABC commentary said. ``The antagonism
generated by such legislation has been an insurmountable obstacle in
the essential task of promoting reconciliation between communities.''
   The government said this week that police officers no longer will
arrest people violating the Separate Amenities Act, but will collect
information and warn the alleged offender that court procedings may
ensue.
   The Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld reported Friday that
blacks who visited a library to donate blood in Evander, another
town controlled by the Conservatives, were told to leave. The 22
blacks were told to donate blood in a van outside the library, Beeld
reported.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Gunmen robbed a bank of $37,000 on
Friday and wounded a police officer, officials said. A telephone
caller said the robbers were part of a leftist radical group that
attacked an army base last month.
   About six to eight well-dressed men with machine guns burst into
the Bank of Galicia and Buenos Aires in this central Argentine city,
said Luis Ibarra Garcia, a bank spokesmen.
   The robbers made off with about 1 million Argentine australs, he
said.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias said one policeman
was shot and wounded and that one of the assailants was struck on
the head by a guard, then carried away by his companions.
   A man who identified himself as ``Commander Victor'' called the
news agency and said the robbers were part of a group that attacked
an army base last month.
   ``This is the start of the expropriation of funds for the fight
to the final victory,'' the caller was quoted as saying.
   A man who identified himself as ``Victor'' later told Radio
General Paz by telephone the assailants were part of the Popular
Resistance Front, a previously unknown group that claimed
responsibility for the Jan. 23 attack on the La Tablada infantry
regiment outside Buenos Aires.
   Eleven soldiers and police died in retaking the base, along with
28 armed civilians. Thirteen young men and women were arrested at
the scene and are being held in jail with seven others arrested
afterward pending formal presentation of charges, and trial.
   The caller said the group also engaged soldiers in a brief
firefight at an army base in Rio Cuarto, south of Cordoba, earlier
this month, and planned ``to continue the fight until final
victory.''

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp toured public
housing alternatives Friday and told homeless advocates he wants to
be one of them, using federal money and his agency to expand housing
projects for the poor.
   ``I don't want to spend my time wallowing in poverty, I want to
combat it,'' Kemp said after touring the Richard Allen Homes, a
public housing complex in a drug-infested North Philadelphia
neighborhood.
   The new housing secretary, a former Republican congressman for
New York who is closely identified with conservative
``supply-side,'' economic theory, acknowledged that dealing with
homelessness would not be cheap.
   ``Sure, it takes money, tax money, but it's aimed at socially
desirable goals on which we can reach a concensus on in this
country,'' he said.
   ``I think there is a lot of goodwill today, that people are ready
to set aside some of the polemics and get busy and make an important
contribution to working on this tragedy, and I plan to be an
advocate,'' Kemp said.
   His two-day visit to Baltimore and Philadelphia was the second in
a number of tours he plans across America ``to see what's going on
about housing,'' he said. Last week he was in Atlanta.
   Officials estimate that Philadelphia, the nation's fifth-largest
city, has more than 18,000 abandoned houses and more than 10,000
homeless people.
   Kemp's tour guide, Robert M. Hayes, a national Coalition for the
Homeless lawyer, said Kemp ``is hearing that federal housing is
needed, desperately needed (and) the message we get from him is that
he is anxious to help.''
   At the Richard Allen Homes, Kemp visited the apartment of
Virginia Wilks, 36, president of the tenants' council.
   She told Kemp about vacancies, vandalism, drug trafficking and
the lack of security, but expressed hope that a $7 million grant
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which
Kemp heads, will turn things around.
   ``We are going to take this place back, but we need his
support,'' she said.
   Kemp responded, ``It's yours to take, but it's more than a
federal effort. It's a state effort, a city effort and also help is
needed from the private sector.''
   Kemp also visited a home rehabilitated with city help by a
non-profit group called Dignity Housing and then rented to a former
homeless family, as well as a downtown residence for 44
once-homeless adults.
   The downtown center was sold by the city to a non-profit
organization called Bethesda Project, which obtained $1.5 million
from public and private sources for renovations.
   After visiting a soup kitchen and a shelter in Baltimore
Thursday, Kemp stopped at several locations in Philadelphia before
spending the night at a HUD-supported apartment complex for the
elderly and the handicapped.

   A storm sliding up the East Coast produced blizzard conditions on
land Friday with wind and up to 18 inches of snow, and 20- to
30-foot waves at sea.
   Snowfall amounts across central and eastern North Carolina
included included 8 inches near Greenville and at Winterville, 6
inches at Windsor and 5 inches at Goldsboro. Blizzard conditions
were reported in Gates and Hertford counties with 18 inches of snow
and drifts to 3 feet, the National Weather Service said.
   Snowfall from the northwest piedmont and northern foothills of
North Carolina ranged from 5 to 8 inches in many areas. Blowing snow
and very low visibility were reported from New Bern, N.C., to
Norfolk, Va.
   The storm's wind piled up waves 20 and 30 feet high at sea and 12
feet high on Chesapeake Bay. Tidal flooding was reported along the
south shore of Chesapeake Bay and along the Elizabeth and Lynhaven
rivers in Virginia.
   Heavy snow at Norfolk, Va., followed record warmth at the end of
last week, a foot of snow last weekend, and thunderstorms and record
warmth at the start of this week.
   Heavy snow over parts of Delaware contributed to drifts of 3 to 4
feet high, the weather service said.
   In southern New Jersey, up to 9 inches of snow was measured at
McKee City with 8 inches reported at Margate and northern Cape May
County.
   High pressure over the lower Ohio Valley and Arkansas continued
to supply the Gulf Coast and Florida with chilly air and low
temperature records were broken from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Temperatures moderated across the central Plains and afternoon
readings rose into the 50s and 60s.
   Elsewhere, light showers developed over the Sierra Nevada range
of east-central California and spread into the Lake Tahoe area.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Massena, N.Y., to 86 at Santee, Calif. Friday's low in
the Lower 48 states was was 14 below zero at Houghton Lake, Mich.
   For Saturday, the storm was expected to center northeast of Maine
and produce widespread snow over central and northern New England.
Scattered snow showers were forecast across the northern Great Lakes
and the lower Great Lakes. Scattered showers were forecast from the
Pacific Northwest into parts of the northern Rockies, with snow
expected across northwestern and north-entral Montana.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted from the northern Great Lakes
into the upper Ohio Valley and New England; in the 30s from the
northern high Plains through the northern Plains, the lower Ohio
Valley and central Appalachians into the mid Atlantic Coast; in the
60s and 70s from the central California coast through the southern
Rockies, the central and southern Plains into the Texas Gulf Coast;
around 60 along the southern tip of Florida; in the 80s over
southern Arizona; and in the 40s or 50s across much of the rest of
the nation.

<HEAD>African Objections Delay Funding of Namibia Peacekeepers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Funding for the Namibia independence plan
was delayed Friday by a last-minute dispute between black African
nations and Western allies over whether the United Nations may buy
goods from South Africa.
   The General Assembly had been scheduled to approve $416 million
for the U.N. peacekeeping force that will guide Namibia to
independence after 74 years of South African rule.
   But the African front-line states insisted on inserting language
into the funding resolution referring to U.N. embargos on buying
military equipment, oil or other goods from South Africa.
   The United States, Britain and France opposed the language,
noting that Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's report to
the Security Council on Namibia said it would be necessary to
purchase goods and services in southern Africa to keep down the cost
of the mission.
   A key sticking point appeared to be where the United Nations
would purchase $10.2 million worth of gasoline and aviation fuel,
diplomats said.
   The two major sources for such refined products in the region are
South Africa and Angola. Overland supply from South Africa would be
easier and less expensive.
   Since 1984, however, the General Assembly has asked the Security
Council to impose a mandatory oil embargo on South Africa, a measure
that Britain and the United States have vetoed.
   General Assembly resolutions against South Africa are only
advisory; Security Council resolutions are enforceable.
   In 1984, the Security Council passed a resolution calling on all
states not to buy military equipment from South Africa, which by
then had developed a flourishing arms industry with export capacity.
   The African front-line diplomats were also debating Friday
whether the U.N. plan to lease 40 mine-resistant vehicles for a year
at $656,000 would violate the embargo. Some contended that other
purchases, such as trucks, radios and construction materials for the
U.N. peacekeepers' barracks, also should be barred.
   The General Assembly's budgetary committee had not resolved the
issue by late Friday, a necessary step before the whole General
Assembly can vote for funds for the Namibia peacekeeping force.
   On April 1, the United Nations intends to begin implementing a
one-year plan for Namibia's independence under the supervision of
the U.N. Transition Assistance Group.
   The mission will send 4,650 military peacekeepers, 500 police
supervisors, more than 760 civilian U.N. staff, 820 locally hired
staff and 620 election monitors to Namibia, which is also called
South-West Africa.
   If necessary, Perez de Cuellar may dispatch a total of 7,500
troops, but the initial deployment was limited as a cost-cutting
measure at the insistence of the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China, who together pay 57 percent of all
peacekeeping costs.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since it captured the colony from
Germany during World War I.
   In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to free Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola
are sent home by mid-1991.
   Angola asked Cuba to send troops to help protect the Marxist
government from cross-border raids by South African troops based in
Namibia, and from a rebellion by the U.S.-backed rebels of UNITA,
the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola.

   An Irish U.N. soldier was machine-gunned to
death by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army on Friday, and
Ireland's foreign minister told an Israeli diplomat the kiling could
damage Israeli-Irish ties.
   In New York, Israeli U.N. Ambassador Johanan Bein ``expressed
regret for the unnecessary death,'' said Israel was investigating
and stressed that the shooting involved only the SLA and not Israeli
troops, Barukh Binah, the Israeli U.N. Mission spokesman, told The
Associated Press.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
said Pvt. Michael McNeela, 21, was shot in the chest by machine-gun
fire from an SLA position overlooking an Irish post in the southern
Lebanese village of Hadatta.
   ``Death was instantaneous,'' said Goksel. ``The fire was not
provoked.''
   In Dublin, Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan called in the Israeli
charge d'affaires and strongly protested what he called the
``unprovoked killing.''
   ``Mr. Lenihan insisted the incident could not but have a negative
effect on relations with Israel,'' said a spokesman for the Foreign
Affairs Department, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The Israeli representative expressed regret and undertook to
convey the views of the Irish government to the Israeli
authorities,'' the spokesman said. The Israeli diplomat was not
identified by name.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said at U.N. Headquarters In New
York that Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, in charge of
peacekeeping, summoned Bein ``and protested strongly this incident.''
   Goulding, in a verbal protest, repeated the U.N. position ``that
Israel is responsible for the South Lebanon Army, and we do not
accept the view that the SLA is acting independently.''
   It was a rarely publicized U.N. diplomatic complaint. The United
Nations seldom makes timely announcements of its protests.
   Diplomatic sources at the United Nations, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the incident appeared to be a mistake and that
the SLA militiaman apparently fired without authorization of his own
superior officer.
   But a statement read by Giuliani said, ``The recent upsurge of
SLA's deliberate and unprovoked firing to UNIFIL positions, mostly
to Irish, has been persistently protested with the Israeli army, but
nothing had come out of these protests.''
   McNeela was on his second tour of duty in Lebanon with the
700-man Irish battalion in the 5,800-member UNIFIL force. He had
planned to marry soon.
   Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of the U.N. force, visited the
village later and told reporters: ``I condemn the senseless killing
of one of my soldiers.''
   Most SLA members are Christians. Israel trains and finances the
militia, which helps 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the Jewish state's
self-designated ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   Israel established the eight-to-10 mile zone in 1985 after
withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.
   Since the U.N. force was deployed in southern Lebanon in 1978
under a U.N. peacekeeping mandate, 160 peacekeepers have been killed
_ 27 of them Irishmen.

   A federal judge on Friday dismissed
racketeering charges against three men indicted last month in the
Pentagon procurement investigation, defense attorneys said.
   While the men _ two private consultants and a suspended Navy
procurement specialist _ are no longer accused of racketeering, they
face a number of other criminal charges stemming from the Jan. 7
indictment, including bribery and theft of government property.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams issued his ruling from the
bench, and said he would file a written order next week, according
to Gerard Treanor, a lawyer for William L. Parkin, a defendant.
   Treanor said the judge agreed with the defense arguments that
prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to satisfy
racketeering charges against consultants Parkin and Fred H. Lackner,
and Stuart E. Berlin, a Navy official who has been suspended without
pay.
   Defense attorneys said a significant result of the dismissal was
that the government would no longer be able to seize cash and other
assets of the defendants under provisions of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   The three men were charged with racketeering and conspiracy to
commit racketeering as part of a 27-count indictment returned by a
federal grand jury.
   The 86-page indictment also included charges against Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a defense contractor that is a
branch of Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, and three Teledyne employees.
   But neither Teledyne Electronics nor its employees were charged
with racketeering, which carries a penalty of 20 years in prison and
a fine of $250,000. The penalty for conspiracy to commit
racketeering is five years in jail and a $250,000. Conviction on a
racketeering charge can also result in forfeiture of any property
garnered illegally.
   Attorneys said Williams also dismissed some wire fraud counts
against the defendants, but refused to grant motions to drop other
charges. The trial is set to begin on March 27.
   In the indictment, the first in the government's 2-1@2 year
investigation into the defense purchasing system, prosecutors
claimed that Teledyne and three of its officers agreed to pay Parkin
$160,000 to assist them in obtaining a Navy contract related to
radar.
   The indictment contended that Parkin then paid Lackner, a
California-based consultant, who, in turn, paid Berlin to manipulate
the contracting procedures so that Teledyne was assured of receiving
the contract.
   The government's coast-to-coast investigation of the $150-million
Pentagon purchasing system, code-named ``Operation Ill Wind,''
centers of allegations that companies paid private consultants to
illegally obtain information about lucrative contracts. Prosecutors
based much of their information on telephone wire taps.

   Maine's governor, John R. McKernan, and
its only congresswoman, Olympia J. Snowe, exchanged marriage vows
Friday in a private ceremony attended by about 100 friends and
relatives.
   ``It was wonderful,'' Snowe said as the newlyweds chatted briefly
with reporters outside the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy
Trinity. Snowe is of Greek descent.
   ``We walked around the table four times _ we did it so well, we
did it an extra time,'' McKernan said, jocularly referring to the
ceremonial walk that is part of the traditional wedding ritual.
   No governor and member of Congress have ever married while both
were in office, according to records checked by The Associated Press.
   The ceremony in Maine's second-largest city, adjacent to Snowe's
hometown of Auburn, consummated a romance they have quietly
maintained for a decade.
   Uniformed and plainclothes state troopers guarded the couple's
privacy at the entrance to the gray church on a suburban hilltop.
   About two dozen reporters and photographers waited outside in
freezing temperatures, although one still photographer and one TV
photographer were allowed inside immediately at the conclusion of
the ceremony.
   ``Wish it could be a little warmer for you,'' Snowe told
reporters as she arrived promptly at 4 p.m.
   The governor had arrived five minutes earlier. ``Am I on time?''
he asked.
   The newlyweds planned to return to the Blaine House, the
governor's mansion 30 miles from Lewiston, for a private reception
for wedding guests Friday evening.
   Later Friday night, weather permitting, they planned to fly on a
friend's plane to New York City for a honeymoon weekend. After that,
they will travel to Washington, where McKernan plans to attend a
national governors conference and Snowe will tend to her
congressional duties.
   About 7,500 people have been invited to a March 4 reception at
the Augusta Civic Center; the $10,000 tab will be covered by
leftover funds from Snowe's last campaign.
   At the Blaine House, the couple received cards by the hundreds
and gifts by the dozen, according to the governor's social
secretary, Sally Bartram.
   Most of the gifts came from personal friends and family, but a
few were received from strangers who were moved by news of the
nuptials. One woman sent the governor a copy of a book that her
husband had written before he died; a second woman sent McKernan
three crocheted doilies.
   ``She just said she admires him,'' Bartram said.
   McKernan, 40, was divorced from his first wife in 1978. Snowe,
42, was widowed in 1973 when her first husband was killed in a car
crash. The governor has an 18-year-old son.
   The two met as Republican members of the Maine House of
Representatives and served together as the state's two
representatives in the U.S. House in the early 1980s.
   McKernan was elected governor in 1986 after two terms in
Congress; Snowe is completing her sixth term in Congress.

<HEAD>$1.5 Million Penalty In Imperial Palace Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A casino owner was fined $1.5 million Friday for
displaying Nazi memorabilia and throwing parties on Hitler's
birthday, state gaming officials said.
   The Nevada Gaming Control Board also placed nine conditions on
Imperial Palace owner Ralph Engelstad's gaming license, including
provisions prohibiting such parties and any displays that would
glorify Hitler or Nazi Germany.
   The agency filed a two-count complaint against Engelstad Dec. 8
citing the collection and parties. He also was cited for allegedly
destroying records pertaining to a pending civil lawsuit.
   Engelstad had faced possible license revocation on the various
charges, but gaming officials said they worked out a compromise to
get the controversial issue settled. The agreement included an
apology by Engelstad.
   He refused comment after a two-hour hearing before the state
Gaming Commission.
   Engelstad's attorney, George Dickerson, defended his client's
actions and said they were done in private. But Gaming Control Board
attorney Scott Shearer contended the fine was appropriate because
Engelstad had damaged the reputation of Nevada and its gaming
industry.
   Shearer said the action should be a warning that the gaming board
``cares about Nevada's image and will take swift action,'' including
license revocation if similar circumstances arise with other
licensees.
   The agreement capped weeks of negotiations between Engelstad's
attorneys and the attorney general's office.
   Dickerson defended the Hitler birthday parties on April 20 in
1986 and 1988, saying they were conducted for crews who worked on
the restoration of Nazi-era cars that were to be used in one of
Engelstad's automobile displays.
   He said his case, if it had proceeded before the commission,
would have involved the issues of free speech and right to privacy.
   Engelstad has said previously his actions were in poor taste and
apologized at the time the incidents were made public
   The parties took place in a private room at the Strip resort,
near a collection of antigue cars that is open to the public daily.
   He said he planned to put the multimillion-dollar collection of
Nazi-era memorabilia on public display, and believed it represented
an important chapter in history.

<HEAD>Group Says Kids Face Cancer Risk from Chemicals on Fruit, Vegetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private environmental group contends in a new
report that preschool children are consuming cancer-causing
chemicals in fruits and vegetables at levels that expose them to
health risks many times greater than the government considers safe.
   The findings by the Natural Resources Defense Council were
immediately challenged by the Environmental Protection Agency, which
said in a statement Friday that health risks to children are taken
into account when setting allowable chemical residue levels.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, a group specializing in
environmental and health matters that has criticized government
policy in numerous areas, is scheduled to announce its findings at a
news conference Monday. An executive summary of the report was
obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
   Janet Hathaway, one of the authors, declined to comment on the
two-year study except to say, ``Our work definitively shows there is
a greatly increased risk to children from chemicals in their diets.''
   The study, according to the summary, concludes that preschoolers
are at an increased risk because they consume many times more in
fruits and vegetables than adults relative to their weight and are
more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.
   The summary said the authors had concluded, after analyzing
consumption data and allowable residues of eight carcinogenic
chemicals on 27 fruits and vegetables, that as many as 5,500 to
6,200 youngsters among the current population of preschoolers ``may
eventually get cancer solely as a result of their exposure (to the
chemicals) before six years of age.''
   This represents, the report continued, a risk of at least five
people in 20,000 getting cancer because of their exposure before the
age of 6 years, much higher than the one in one million considered
allowable by the EPA in its risk analysis formula.
   Critics of the study said it raises false fears among parents.
   ``It's voodoo statistics. This has nothing to do with the
realities of disease,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, executive
director of the American Council on Science and Health.
   There ``is no evidence of even one case of human cancer in
children and adults being linked to exposure to the minute pesticide
residues in food,'' said Dr. Whelan in a telephone interview. She
maintained there are greater health risks in not using the
pesticides.
   The environmental group's study concludes that the typical
preschooler receives four times greater exposure on average than
adult women to eight carcinogenic pesticides the group evaluated and
that in some cases the increased exposure is as much as 18 times
that of adults.
   ``Our nation's children are being harmed by the very fruits and
vegetables we tell them will make them grow up healthy and strong,''
concludes the report summary.
   The group's conclusions were based on fruit and vegetable
consumption figures from the Agriculture Department and on levels of
pesticide residues found on 27 fruits and vegetables according to
the Food and Drug Administration and the EPA, the study said.
   Preschoolers eat six times as much fruit in general, seven times
as much grapes, apples and apple sauce and 18 times as much apple
juice as an adult, the study said. It said that half of all fruits
sampled by the FDA in 1987 ``had detectable levels of pesticides.''
   In a statement, the EPA said the agency ``is concerned about
potentially higher pesticide exposure to children and infants,'' but
that it takes those concerns into account when determining levels of
pesticides that are allowed on food.
   John Moore, acting EPA deputy administrator, said in an
interview, however, that the agency does not agree with some of its
critics that it should across the board ``add another potency factor
in addition to what we use to accommodate the fact that kids are
exposed more'' to certain foods containing some level of pesticides.
   He added that the agency's chemical tolerance levels for fruits
and vegetables ``is designed to protect the average person against
any short or long-term harmful effects that might result from an
entire lifetime of exposure to pesticide residues in food, including
exposure during childhood.''
   The private group's study saw exposure to daminozide, a growth
regulator, as posing the greatest risk to children among the
carcinogenic chemicals they examined with a potential cancer risk to
preschoolers of 1 case in every 4,200 people exposed. The EPA
recently said it plans to order the product, which is used on
apples, off the market and the producers of processed apple products
have said for the most part it is no longer is being used by their
industry.

<HEAD>Board Recommends Bush Block Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency recommended Friday that
President Bush intervene and block a strike planned next week by
Eastern Airlines mechanics and ground personnel, an administration
official said.
   The National Mediation Board suggested Bush name a presidential
emergency board to investigate the protracted dispute, said
presidential spokesman B. Jay Cooper, accompanying Bush on a
three-nation trip to the Far East.
   If Bush accepted the recommendation it would automatically delay
the strike, schedule to begin March 4, by 60 days.
   ``It's under review,'' Cooper said of the recommendation. He said
the president will consult with the Labor, Transportation and
Justice departments before deciding.
   An earlier order blocking a strike expires at midnight March 3,
in effect imposing a deadline of midnight next Friday for Bush to
act.
   If Bush approves the recommendation, the union will be restrained
from striking during a 30-day investigation and a follow-on 30-day
cooling off period.
   The mediation board made the recommendations after a final round
of mediation with Eastern management and representatives of the
International Association of Machinists failed to produce a
settlement in the 16-month dispute, the sources said.
   Attempts to reach board officials Friday after word of the
recommendation surfaced were unsuccessful. But grounds for
recommending such a panel include a finding that a strike probably
would cause an emergency in the affected industry.
   Labor leaders have been urging Bush to intervene in the dispute,
which centers on Eastern's demands for $150 million a year in annual
concessions from the Machinists union.
   The union contends Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
which owns Eastern, is trying to destroy the airline and incorporate
most of its operations into non-union Continental Airlines, another
Texas Air property.
   ``I would hope the president would accept the board's
recommendation for the good of the workers and the good of the
airline,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said when informed of the
mediation board's recommendation.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell, asked for the airline's reaction
to the NMB recommendation referred to a Tuesday letter to the board
from Thomas J. Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human
resources, who was responding to reports the board was leaning
toward asking Bush to intervene.
   ``This course of action as the effect of almost totally underming
the negotiations,'' the letter said. ``Is the NMB trying to create
an atmosphere for an agreement or do the bidding for one side? ...
There is no precedent for this action in the airline industry.''
   The letter said there was no evidence interstate commerce would
be disrupted during a strike, grounds for presidential intervention
under the Railway-Labor Act.
   Several labor leaders familiar with labor laws said it is
unprecedented for a president to ignore recommendations from the
mediation board to name an emergency panel.
   Such boards have 60 days to review the dispute and to make
contract proposals. If the board's final offer is rejected the panel
can submit it to Congress, which then can enter the contract-writing
business by imposing the proposal on both sides in the dispute.

<HEAD>Official Says Program Being Scaled Back Because So Few Applying For
Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So few people are applying for political
asylum under a tough new one-day procedure that the immigration
service has scaled back the extra staff it brought in to start the
program, an official said Friday.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said the
dropping numbers indicate the program is succeeding in discouraging
``frivolous'' applications. The agency maintains that most
asylum-seekers are here for economic reasons, and are not fleeing
persecution, a requirement for obtaining refugee status.
   Twenty-six asylum examiners will be sent home by Monday, said
Alfonso De Leon, the INS assistant district director for
examinations.
   One of the two State Department personnel on hand to issue
advisory opinions returned home Thursday, De Leon added.
   ``They are subject to recall, but it's just not cost-effective to
have them here with the numbers that are showing up, or should I say
not showing up,'' said De Leon, who oversees the adjudication
process.
   A total of 50 examiners have been on duty here since Tuesday
under a new policy in which asylum-seekers face immediate jailing,
detention and deportation proceedings if their cases are denied.
   More of the 24 case examiners remaining after Monday and part of
the clerical staff also may be sent back home if the number of
applicants remains extremely low, De Leon said.
   The INS reported it processed 233 asylum applications Tuesday,
the first day of the get-tough procedure. Only two people were
granted asylum that day.
   Of 51 applications submitted Wednesday, none was approved. The
number of applicants dropped to 10 Thursday, all of whom were
rejected and detained.
   Of the 19 processed Friday, a 20-year-old Nicaraguan student was
the only one granted asylum.
   ``I understand he is active in a political party and had been in
prison for his political beliefs,'' said INS spokeswoman Virginia
Kice.
   Single adults face detention here at the INS' minimum-security
Port Isabel Service Processing Center. Family groups are sent to an
American Red Cross shelter in Brownsville, where they must report
for daily INS roll calls or face deportation proceedings in absentia.
   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson said Monday the program was designed
to discourage the tens of thousands of Central Americans pouring
across the Rio Grande illegally in southern Texas over the past year.
   More than 40,000 have applied for asylum in the area since last
May, when the INS noted a dramatic upsurge in immigration from that
region.
   Until recently, the INS was seeing 2,000 or more Central American
asylum applicants weekly at its Harlingen District at the southern
tip of the state.
   Immigration advocates opposed to the new program said the
immigrants simply have gone underground, and will take their chances
of apprehension by the Border Patrol. Those apprehended may pursue
asylum in immigration courts.
   De Leon said it was too early to declare the new program a
success, but added, ``I have received reports ... that the word is
out throughout Central America and even groups in the pipeline have
turned around and gone back.''

<HEAD>FAA Proposes $801,000 Fine Against Northwest For Violations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, The airline, to further explain proposed nature

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a
$801,000 fine against Northwest Airlines on Friday for violations
including the use of Boeing jumbo jets on 8,198 flights without a
required engine bolt inspection.
   The airline was also charged with making unauthorized repairs on
two 747s and failure to comply with a dozen other FAA rules and
directives.
   The airline has 15 days to respond to the civil penalty. The
proposed fine amounts to a settlement offer from the FAA which will
take effect if the airline does not object. The FAA said it first
outlined the alleged violations in a Feb. 17 letter to Northwest
President John F. Horn
   William Slattery, Northwest executive vice president for
operations, described the problems as primarily ``instances of
inadequate record keeping and differences in interpretation.''
   Slattery said none of the issues questions the safe operation of
airliners belonging the Minneapolis-based airline. He said the
airline had completed original required inspections but had not
accomplished ``repetitive follow-up inspections.''
   He said discussion between the FAA over the past year had reduced
the number of alleged violations from 139 to a dozen and the airline
would continue to discuss the remaining matters with federal
authorities.
   ``Our objective is to ensure Northwest is adhering to all federal
aviation regulations,'' Slattery said, noting that other FAA fines
against airlines had ranged from $252,000 to $9.5 million.
   One case in the latest proposed penalty involved Northwest
failing to comply with an FAA ``airworthiness directive'' for
inspecting engine pylon attach bolts on 24 Boeing 747s while
continuing to fly the planes, the FAA said.
   ``Although after-the-fact checks did not disclose any defects in
the bolts, these 8,198 flights constituted violations of safety
regulations because the airline did not do the inspections in the
specified time frame,'' the FAA said.
   The unauthorized repairs were on flap panels and horizontal and
vertical stabilizers on two 747s, the agency said.
   It said other allegations included improperly deferring
maintenance and flight crew over-scheduling.
   The problems were discovered during a month-long, in-depth FAA
inspection of the airline in January and February 1988 as part of a
national safety inspection program, the FAA said. It published a
100-page report on the inspections in March, which included praise
of Northwest for conducting its own internal audit which led to
several changes in company practices before the start of the FAA
inspection.

   At F.W. Woolworth Co. in downtown Boston, the
sweaters are on sale, jelly beans are two bags for a dollar and the
gun of the month is an M-1 semi-automatic carbine.
   It's no toy, and City Councilor David Scondras wants the
department store and other stores to stop selling assault weapons.
   ``Woolworth's is viewed as a wholesome American store, every kid
in America knows about Woolworth's,'' Scondras said Friday. ``When
you say it's OK to sell something at Woolworth's then it sends a
message ... It sanctions the buying and selling of assault
weapons,'' he said.
   The high number of gun-related deaths in Boston's neighborhoods
along with the easy availability of assault weapons has led Scondras
and nine other council members to introduce a measure that would
outlaw the sale of assault weapons in the city. The council has 13
members.
   ``It'll be brought to a vote before the end of March. By April
they won't be selling them,'' he said. The measure would not ban
standard handguns.
   Los Angeles and Stockton, Calif., have banned military-style,
semi-automatic assault weapons recently in the aftermath of the
killing of five elementary students in Stockton. Last month, a man
used an assault rifle to spray a schoolyard with 100 bullets within
two minutes.
   Ordinances banning the weapons have also been introduced in New
York, New Orleans and Cleveland, as well as Maryland, Florida and
Wisconsin.
   Robert Giroux, manager of the downtown store who refused to
comment on Scondras' complaints, said several other Woolworth's
stores sell firearms. Telephone calls to the company's New York
headquarters were not returned Friday.
   ``Gun of the Month'' has long been a feature in the Woolworth's
sporting goods department, located across from the children's
section and upstairs from the pet shop, where finches were marked
down below half-price Friday.
   The M-1 carbine, a smaller, lighter version of the .30-caliber
rifle of the U.S. Army in World War II, was on sale for $199.99.
   Scondras also was disturbed by a bolt-action rifle with a bayonet
on display at the store.
   ``You're not going to tell me that when you're selling a bayonet
and a military weapon, and all this military imagery, you're selling
(hunting gear),'' he said. ``You're pushing a fantasy for Rambo.''
   Giroux said the bayonet was removed after the councilor's
complaints were publicized.
   Woolworth's sports department sells fishing gear, bows and
arrows, bowie knives, shotguns and a limited variety of other
rifles, but no handguns.
   Assault weapons ``aren't appealing to recreational sports,
they're appealing to Rambo,'' Scondras said. ``We've been sending
this wrong message for a long time, that you deal with your problems
by blowing away your enemies.''

   Republicans hung tough Friday on John Tower's
troubled nomination to be Defense Secretary, with President Bush
saying from Tokyo, ``there is no fallback, there is no option,'' to
the controversial appointment.
   ``I'll be talking to whoever has an open mind on this subject,''
Bush said in vowing a personal lobbying campaign upon his return to
the United States early next week. The president said he was not
questioning the motivation of key Senate Democrats who have opposed
the Tower nomination.
   The nomination, rejected on an 11-9 party-line vote in the Senate
Armed Services Committee, goes before the full Senate later next
week.
   ``I wouldn't be in a fight if I didn't think we could win it,''
Bush said in remarks to reporters shortly before leaving Tokyo on
Saturday morning, Tokyo time.
   Tower has been battling allegations of excessive drinking and
womanizing, as well as questions about possible conflict of interest
stemming from the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned as a
defense consultant earlier in the decade.
   Bush said many opponents had noted perceptions of Tower's
problems, and added, ``That's not a fair enough, not a high enough
standard.''
   Earlier Bush had said, ``I stand strongly behind'' the
appointment and arranged for a personal lobbying campaign when he
returns home.
   Suggestions from majority Democrats that Tower withdraw and avert
a bruising battle between the Bush administration and the Senate
next week were brushed aside.
   Tower met at the White House with Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole and Vice President Dan Quayle for a strategy session, and Dole
said afterwards there was no talk of a possible withdrawal.
   Dole added Bush would be meeting individually next week with 10
or so potential Democratic supporters in hopes of salvaging the
nomination.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that Bush
must pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation.
Dole said he believed all 45 Republicans were behind Tower.
   In his Friday remarks in Japan, Bush said, ``I want them
(senators) to know how strongly I feel. And I feel it's not a
personal win or lose, it's what's right, who is best to run the
Defense Department. And that's what's at stake. And I'm going to win
this battle.''
   Dole also said the White House is at work preparing a summary of
the confidential FBI file on Tower that can be released to the
public in hopes of demonstrating that allegations him are baseless.
   The committee roll call transformed what had been a debate over
Tower's fitness into a fierce partisan battle over a president's
right to pick the members of his own Cabinet, and Dole made clear
the stakes involved for Bush.
   ``This is the president's first controversial vote and I think he
has a right to expect all of us to support him,'' he said of the
Republicans.
   At the same time he said, ``I hope there's no party effort to
line up every Democrat against John Tower.''
   He said a pitched partisan battle could ``be an end to the
honeymoon for both Georges _ the president and Senate Majority
Leader Mitchell, D-Maine.''
   Mitchell said in a statement he has not decided how to vote,
adding that whatever the outcome, ``I sincerely hope that we can
continue to work with the administration'' on the nation's problems.
   Despite the fighting words from Republicans, one conservative
Democrat said ``it would be best'' if Tower withdrew. ``Difficult
and controversial decisions will have to be made at the Defense
Department during the next four years,'' said Sen. David Boren of
Oklahoma.
   ``When controversial decisions have to e implemented, it becomes
even more difficult when the decision maker himself is controversial
for other reasons. We need a defense secretary that can garner more
unified support.''
   One Democrat on Bush's list of possible votes is Sen. Howell
Heflin of Alabama. Another was Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a senator from
Texas who introduced his former colleague warmly at his confirmation
hearing several weeks ago. Both men told reporters they were
undecided on the nomination and would make up their minds after
reading the FBI report.
   Administration officials also contacted Sen. Chris Dodd, a
liberal Democrat from Connecticut, to meet with Bush. One official
noted that Tower was been one of only five senators _ and one of
only two Republicans _ to vote against a resolution censuring Dodd's
father, Sen. Thomas Dodd, in 1967. A spokesman for Dodd said he was
undecided.
   Some Democrats were clearly hoping the nomination wouldn't come
to a floor vote.
   Boren, who said he hasn't made up his mind, issued a statement
calling on Tower to withdraw.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said after casting his
committee vote that withdrawal would be wise and predicted swift
confirmation for a replacement nominee.
   Mitchell, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, said he wasn't
suggesting withdrawal. But he said he was certain that ``the
president will consider all the possible options, including that
one,'' and added that a replacement nominee would probably be
confirmed ``in a relatively short period of time.''
   But Bush wouldn't hear of it. ``I stand strongly with John
Tower,'' he told reporters. ``He is my choice, my only choice, and I
am standing with him.''

   Only five weeks into the new presidency, the
Federal Reserve Board is teaching the Bush administration a painful
lesson. It doesn't pay to get into a fight with the folks who set
interest rates.
   Since taking office, President Bush has been suggesting the Fed
not choke off the economic expansion by pushing interest rates
higher.
   The president got the Fed's response Friday. And it was just the
opposite of what he had hoped to hear.
   The central bank raised its discount rate, the fee it charges for
loans to commercial banks, to 7 percent, its highest level in three
years.
   A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the
board can send of its intentions to push a broad range of interest
rates higher in an effort to slow an overheated economy.
   Three times since Jan. 20, Bush has brushed away worries about
inflation and said he didn't see the need for the Fed to give the
economy a dose of tighter credit. Rather, he said, the central bank
should worry more about economic growth because he did not see signs
that inflation was getting out of hand.
   Those comments were echoed Thursday by the administration's chief
economic spokesman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who said
central bank policy-makers were anticipating too much. He likened
the Fed's efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates to
shooting at a duck.
   ``When you're aiming at a duck, you can miss it. You can aim too
much ahead of it or too much behind it,'' Brady said, adding that
the administration would like the Fed to ``aim a little closer to
it.''
   Brady did not even try to sugarcoat the message by adding, as
Bush had, that he did not believe he and the central bank were all
that far apart.
   Bush sought to drive that point home again during a news
conference Friday in Tokyo, where he was concluding the first leg of
an Asian tour before heading to China.
   Answering reporters questions, Bush acknowledged that he and Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, differ somewhat on the question of
the threat of a resurgence of inflation.
   ``We talked about this,'' Bush said. ``He was more concerned''
about the most recent consumer price figures, which showed inflation
increasing at an annual rate of more than 7 percent a year.
   ``But I don't think you can make a judgment on one months'
figures,'' Bush said. ``But look, if he's right on inflation, his
concerns, if they're a little more than mine, we should be alert to
that.''
   The president went on to say that he and Greenspan have ``got a
little difference of interpretation, now, as to how you read the
indicators on inflation.'' But Bush said ``that's the only
difference we've got.''
   Bush said he did not like to see interest rates rising, and said
that ``this argues even more forcefully than I've been able to argue
that we need to be able to get an agreement'' with Congress on a new
fiscal 1990 budget that meets deficit-reduction targets.
   While disputes between the central bank and a president are not
uncommon, some members of Congress were taken aback by Brady's
apparent disregard for the threat of inflation, especially given the
barrage of bad news on the price front in recent weeks.
   Labor costs, wholesale prices and consumer prices have all been
headed higher. The government reported Wednesday that retail prices
shot up at their fastest pace in two years last month, an annual
rate of 7.2 percent, almost double the 4.4 percent increase recorded
in 1988.
   ``I'm disappointed that the administration is not more serious
about this problem,'' Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., lectured Brady
during his appearance before the House Banking Committee.
   What concerns many observers is that the Fed may be forced to
boost interest rates higher and more quickly than it had intended to
dispell doubts in financial markets about the central bank's resolve
to fight inflation because of the administration's verbal sniping.
   Greenspan, a longtime Republican strategist and close friend of
Bush, has gone out of his way to emphasize the central bank's
political independence even though he and the other six board
members were all appointed by former President Reagan.
   Recognizing the dangers of a public dispute with the Fed, Bush
budget director Richard Darman took the unusual step on Friday of
telling his colleagues in the administration to cool it.
   He said disputes between an administration and the Fed were
``extremely unhelpful'' adding, ``It tends to be unsettling to the
(financial) markets, unsettling to foreigners and confusing to
people who are trying to plan and none of those things is good for
the economy.''
   Darman's unspoken fear is that foreigners, who finance an
increasing share of America's borrowing needs, might suddenly decide
to dump their dollar-denominated assets because of fears that the
Fed had responded to political pressure and abandoned its
inflation-fighting campaign.
   Many economists believe such a ``dollar strike'' is the most
likely way the next recession will be triggered. Fears about the
intentions of foreign investors helped trigger Black Monday, the
508-point drop in the stock market of October 1987.
   With the increase in the discount rate, the central bank hopes to
demonstrate its resolve and keep the economy headed toward a soft
landing, the process whereby gradual increases in interest rates are
enough over time to slow economic demand and thus relieve
inflationary pressures.
   Many economists believe the process will work. They note that the
Fed's credit tightening has already boosted short-term interest
rates by around 3 percentage points since March, when the tightening
began. They predict overall growth should begin slowing
significantly by this spring.
   If the Fed is successful, the economic recovery, already at a
peacetime record of six years, will keep steaming ahead.
   But if inflation keeps rising and the Fed is forced to clamp down
even tighter, then Bush's worst fears of a recession could come
true.

   President Bush's diplomatic debut on the world stage
has been soured and his new administration has been thrown on the
defensive by a Senate committee's rejection of his choice of John
Tower to be defense secretary.
   And if that weren't enough, Bush got more bad news from home
during his Far East tour Friday when the Federal Reserve Board
boosted its key discount rate to dampen inflationary pressures. Bush
has been arguing that there is not enough inflation to justify
higher interest rates.
   With leaders of more than 160 nations assembled here for the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, the politically embarrassing news of
Tower's rebuff by the Senate Armed Services Committee was splashed
across the front pages of Japanese newspapers.
   Back in the United States, television viewers saw reporters
bombarding Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft with questions about Tower's
troubles, not the president's talks with foreign leaders.
   All in all, it wasn't the kind of script the White House would
have written for Bush's first overseas journey as president,
although at a news conference in Tokyo Saturday morning, Bush sought
to downplay his disagreement with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, and
he disputed that the Tower problem had cast a cloud on his trip.
   The president said he and Greenspan have ``got a little
difference of interpretation, now, as to how you read the indicators
on inflation,'' but, ``that's the only difference we've got.'' As to
Tower?
   ``I think people that are serious students of foreign policy and
are interested in foreign policy objectives are not going to view
this trip in the context of a flap over the John Tower nomination. I
think there's much more serious points in foreign policy to be made.
   ``And if it's beclouded by some political battle back home right
now, so be it,'' Bush said.
   The selection of Tower has been a festering problem for Bush,
even before the nomination was announced in January. There have been
repeated questions about excessive drinking, womanizing and possible
conflict of interest involving defense contractors.
   Dismissing the allegations as rumor and gossip, Bush has
steadfastly defended Tower and taken the political heat.
   ``I'm going to strongly continue to back Sen. Tower and I do not
believe he is going down the drain,'' Bush said. He vowed to carry
the fight to salvage the nomination to the Senate floor.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu was on the telephone to
Washington throughout the night trying to devise a workable
strategy. Bush made some calls to influential senators, but to no
avail.
   The 11-9 vote against Tower, split solidly along party lines with
the Democrats holding the edge, dealt a blow to Bush and the song of
bipartisan cooperation he has been singing since his inauguration a
month ago.
   Putting the best possible face on the situation, Bush said, ``The
honeymoon's still going fine and I'm not going to get total
agreement on every issue.''
   However, he acknowledged that considering he wants Tower
confirmed as his Pentagon chief, ``I can't say it's a pat on the
back.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said it would be a
``kick in the teeth'' to the president if the full Senate rejected
Tower. Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the committee's party-line
vote against Tower would make it harder to forge a bipartisan
defense policy.
   Here for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, the president held
separate talks over the last two days with the leaders of 17
nations. By all appearances, the sessions went off without a hitch,
although the stakes did not seem very high.
   In advance of the trip, Scowcroft had said the meetings would not
delve into substantive issues, nor would they yield any decisions.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the problem
with Tower did not come up in any of Bush's meetings.
   Nevertheless, Baker acknowledged that Tower's difficulties were
hurting the administration.
   ``It is not in the best interest of foreign policy of the United
States to have a nomination hang fire for this long,'' the secretary
of state said. ``It's very difficult to proceed when you don't have
one of your major national security players in place.''
   Bush is not willing to play hardball politics with Congress and
blame anyone at this early stage for fouling things up.
   In particular, he said he had no problem with Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman who singled out Tower's drinking
record as a good reason for rejecting him.
   ``I have no acrimony and I'm not going to be drawn into
name-calling or a political accusation here,'' Bush said. ``I'm not
going to do that. I've got to work with the Senate on a lot of
issues. But I want them to know how strongly I feel.
   ``And I feel it's not a personal win or lose, it's what's right,
who is best to run the Defense Department,'' the president said.

   President Bush said Friday he didn't question
whether it was right for him to be there while attending the funeral
of Emperor Hirohito, but he admitted having memories of fighting the
Japanese in the Pacific.
   ``I can't say that in the quiet of the ceremony that my mind
didn't go back to the wonder of it all,'' Bush told a news
conference. ``I vividly remember the personal friends that were in
our squadron that are no longer alive, ... but my mind didn't dwell
on that at all.''
   Bush, the youngest pilot in the Navy when he was commissioned,
was shot down by Japanese gunners on Sept. 2, 1944, during a bombing
attack on Chichi Jima. His two crew members were killed and he was
rescued by a passing American submarine.
   There had been criticism of Bush for attending the funeral of
Hirohito, the last of the World War II leaders to die.
   Bush said his thoughts had ``nothing to do about whether it was
right to be here. ... And perhaps having been in combat in World War
II, maybe the decision was more correct, maybe it was more profound
to be here. ... I'm representing the United States of America.''
   ``We're talking about a friend, we're talking about an ally,'' he
said.

   A man called a Honolulu radio station last month
threatening to bomb an American plane unless a jailed member of the
Japanese Red Army was released by Friday, a station spokesman said.
Japanese police said the terrorist group probably would not attack
an American target.
   Danny Oshita, general manager of the radio station KOHO, said the
caller on Jan. 23 demanded the freedom of Osamu Maruoka and asked
that the message be relayed to the Japanese Consulate in Honolulu.
The caller, who spoke in Japanese, hung up without identifying
himself.
   Oshita said he relayed the message to the consulate and later was
interviewed by the FBI.
   U.S. investigators said there was no indication that a bomb
caused the hole in the fuselage of United Airlines Flight 811, which
made an emergency landing in Honolulu after nine people were sucked
out of the plane and killed.
   In Tokyo, a senior National Police Agency official said Saturday
it was ``not realistic to assume the Japanese Red Army was
responsible'' for the incident.
   Police here said last month they feared the Lebanon-based
Japanese Red Army might attack Japanese embassies abroad to disrupt
the funeral Friday of Emperor Hirohito or to press for the release
of Maruoka and Hiroshi Sensui, another Red Army member detained in
Japan.
   Maruoka was arrested last November. He was wanted in connection
with a 1972 attack at Israel's Lod Airport in which 26 people were
killed, and the hijacking of a jetliner over India in 1977.
   The Japanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that if the Japanese Red Army wanted to pressure the Tokyo
government, it probably would have chosen a target more closely
related to Japan and the Japanese people than an American aircraft
flying from Hawaii to New Zealand.
   He also said that if the plane was bombed, ``I don't think (the
Japanese Red Army) would actually explode the bomb so easily. ...
Once it explodes, they can't use it for bargaining any more.''
   He said Japanese authorities were aware of the threat to the
Hawaiian radio station.

   A 12-year-old boy was in custody Friday
night in connection with the fatal shooting of his mother and the
wounding of his father in their home, police said.
   The boy, Matthew Nupp, had apparently gotten into trouble earlier
in the day at school in this Washington, D,C., suburb and argued
with his mother, Evelyn, before she was shot three times with a .22
caliber rifle, police said.
   Moments later, the boy's father, James T. Nupp, returned home
early from his job as a medical researcher and was also shot, police
said. He managed to call police before staggering outside and
collapsing, they said. Nupp was shot three times and was listed in
fair condition at Suburban Hospital.
   When James Nupp entered the home through the back door, he was
unaware that his wife had been shot, said police spokesman Harry
Geehreng. Nupp then saw his wife's body on the kitchen floor and his
son, holding the rifle and standing in a nearby basement stairwell.
   The boy opened fire from the stairwell and continued shooting as
he followed his father through the kitchen and outside on the back
porch, Geehreng said.
   Mrs. Nupp was apparently cooking dinner when the shooting
occurred.
   Two other Nupp children, a 7-year-old boy and a 3-year-old, were
in the home at the time of the shooting, police said.
   When police arrived, Matthew Nupp was in the basement, but he
came out the back door without the gun and surrendered, police said.
   Matthew Nupp was being questioned, but had not yet been charged.
One unanswered question was whether he would be charged an adult
with murder or handled as a juvenile.
   The family kept three guns in the house, but James Nupp told
police he believed all the weapons had been locked in the attic.

   President Bush, his visit to Asia distracted by the
imperiled nomination of Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, bade
farewell to Japan's new emperor Saturday and said his introductory
talks with foreign leaders ``laid some good groundwork'' for
maintaining global peace.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, left Tokyo's Haneda Airport aboard
Air Force One, on a more than four-hour flight to Beijing, at
midday. A heavy rain fell as the Boeing-707 jet took off. Bush was
looking forward to a nostalgic return to his former diplomatic post
in China. But first he grappled with questions concerning Tower and
summed up his two days in Japan.
   ``Throughout all of our disscussions ... I found a shared sense
of satisfaction ... that East-West relations are now clearly
proceeding on the basis of an agenda favorable to the United States,
its allies, its friends,'' Bush told reporters.
   In discussions with Middle Eastern and European leaders, as well
as leaders of third-world nations such as Pakistan, Bush said,
``We've laid some good groundwork here.. ... and that will help us
as we go down the road.''
   Bush also said that during his trip to China, he will bring up
human rights, but said he has no specific cases to press with his
hosts. The president revealed that he will will meet in Beijing, as
well, with Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Bush said the United States believes that Sihanouk should head an
interim government once Vietnamese troops complete their pullout of
forces from Cambodia later this year. He also reiterated American
opposition to a return to power by the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge.
   He defended Tower again in his session with reporters, saying he
had no ``fallback'' planned except to lobby strongly with ``whoever
has an open mind on the subject.'' The Senate will take up the Tower
nomination shortly after Bush's return from Asia next week.
   Bush was arriving in China at mid-day Beijing time, 3:30 a.m. EST
Washington time.
   ``Both countries have come so far since my stay in China,'' Bush
said in written responses to questions posed by Xinhua, the Chinese
news agency. The remarks were released by the White House as Bush
prepared to leave for Beijing.
   Bush said the world remained ``a tumultuous, dangerous place,''
but said he was optimistic. ``I would say that any man with 11
grandchildren is a cautious optimist by definition. He has a big
stake in the future.''
   On China, Bush conceded that the United States ``has some big
differences'' with Beijing on some issues, but said he wanted to
travel there to show the Chinese leaders that he will never take
them for granted.
   Bush also said that ``we've passed the day'' of confining
Sino-American relations to discussions limited to America's security
interests alone. ``The relationship's strong and I'd like to
strengthen it,'' he said.
   Although Bush's Asian tour so far has been distracted by the
burgeoning battle with Congress over Tower, the president earlier
sought to stress the primary reason for his visit to Japan _ Emperor
Hirohito's funeral.
   During his nearly half-hour exchange with reporters gathered in
the U.S. ambassador's residence here, the president also:
   _He and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan have ``a little
difference of interpretation'' of economic indicators relating to
inflation. Bush said that he does not like seeing interest rates
raised _ as the Fed did in Washington Friday _ and said he believes
there will be less pressure on interest rates if he and Congress
agree on a fiscal 1990 budget that meets the $100 billion
deficit-reduction target.
   _Said that in his talks with Mideast leaders, he ``made clear the
continuing readiness'' of the United States to ``facilitate this
process'' in a way is consistent with Israel's security interests
and ``positive developments'' in the Arab world. Bush has kept open
the low-level contacts that then-President Ronald Reagan established
with the Palestine Liberation Organization late last year.
   _Admitted that while attending the funeral services for Emperor
Hirohito, he had thoughts of his shooting down over the Pacific by
the Japanese during World War II, but said that he ``didn't dwell on
that at all.''
   `` ... Perhaps having been in combat in World War II, maybe the
decision (to come to Tokyo) was more correct,'' he said. ``Maybe it
was more profound to be here. I'm representing the United States of
America. We're talking about a friend. We're talking about an ally.''
   He said the Hirohito funeral was ``beautifully staged and
beautifully carried out.''
   Bush met briefly at the Imperial Palace with Japan's new emperor,
Akihito, before sitting down separately with Presidents Jose Sarney
of Brazil and Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, bringing to 20 the
number of foreign leaders he has met with in two days of fast-paced
diplomacy here.
   In his remarks to the Chinese news agency, Bush declared that
``the one constant in today's world is change. For the most part,
the direction of change is positive from the standpoint of America's
values and interests.''
   ``Let me say that I certainly agree that the current state of our
relationship is healthy,'' he said.
   He vowed to work for increased trade with China and pledged ``to
keep up the dialogue between our two governments on political issues
of mutual concern,'' which Bush listed as global peace, easing of
regional conflicts, arms control, and combating drugs, terrorism and
threats to the environment.
   He said the United States hoped that a recent easing of tensions
between Taiwan and China could be accelerated. But he said the
United States remains committed to keeping troops in South Korea,
which he will visit on Monday on his way home to Washington.
   ``It would be far too optimistic, at this point, where the
deterrence provided by U.S. forces in Korea is no longer needed,''
he said.
   During his two days in Beijing, Bush is slated to hold one-on-one
sessions with the nation's top four leaders, discuss matters ranging
from Taiwan to trade, and even host a Texas-style barbecue.
   In Bush's meeting with Philippine President Aquino, he vowed
continued strong support for a proposed $200 million in aid to the
Pacific nation contained in budgets submitted by both himself and
former President Reagan, Fitzwater said.
   Bush also ``reiterated U.S. support for her government and for
democracy in that country,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush also met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Belgian
King Baudouin, Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, Italian President Francesco Cossiga.
   In addition, the president and his wife had dinner with King Juan
Carlos of Spain and his queen, Sophia.
   Meanwhile, Baker held a separate session Friday with Japanese
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno that included a discussion of a
controversial proposed joint venture to build the FSX jet aircraft.
   Although the Reagan administration approved the agreement for
Japanese-U.S. construction on a new version of the F-16 fighter, the
Bush administration is reassessing the proposal.
   According to Yukio Okamato, an official with the Japanese foreign
ministry, Uno voiced hope ``for a smooth implementation of the
agreement as soon as possible.''

   Church bells rang out across this
island nation Saturday as Filipinos celebrated the third anniversary
of the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos. But the lingering
discord here was plain to see.
   About 3,000 Marcos supporters marched Saturday demanding their
ousted leader's return from Hawaiian exile.
   The military said a soldier and his wife were arrested in a van
packed with explosives headed toward the site where President
Corazon Aquino was to speak later in the day.
   The military also said an officer was placed under restrictions
in southeastern Luzon for purported links to renegade Lt. Col.
Gregorio Honasan, leader of the August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs.
Aquino.
   Filipinos awaited the return of Mrs. Aquino from Japan, where she
attended the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, to take part in
festivities marking the climax of the ``people power'' uprising that
propelled her to office.
   The main celebrations were planned on Epifanio delos Santos
Avenue, where hundreds of thousands of people turned out three years
ago to protect military officers who mutinied against Marcos.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre said about 2,000 troops would
provide security. Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986 and
Marcos fled to Hawaii.
   Some prominent Filipinos who helped put her in power said they
were boycotting the ceremonies because the Aquino government lacks
direction.
   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital
Region Defense Command, said the soldier and his wife were arrested
about 9 p.m. Friday in Taytay, a few miles east of the celebration
venue. He said the van was headed for Manila.
   ``The implication is quite big,'' Oxales said. Asked if the
explosives were meant for a new coup attempt, he said: ``We're
trying to find out.''
   Col. Marino Filart, Philippine Constabulary regional commander
for southeastern Luzon, said a police captain was placed under
restrictions Friday in Albay province, 200 miles southeast of
Manila, after admitting contacts with Honasan's group.
   Filart said the captain, whose name was not released, said
Honasan's group asked him to join them but he refused. Filart said
dissidents had been trying to recruit followers in his area.
   Honasan was prominent in the anti-Marcos uprising, but then led a
coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino on Aug. 28, 1987. He escaped from
custody in April.
   On Friday, about 10,000 leftists took to the streets to express
their dissatisfaction with Mrs. Aquino, shouting anti-government
slogans and burning a 10-foot papier mache effigy of the president.
   Masked youths burned tires and exploded firecrackers and rockets
during Friday's six-hour protest. The rally took place at the
Mendiola Bridge, about 300 yards from the presidential palace.
   Many of the disparate groups that rallied around Mrs. Aquino,
whose politics are centrist, have since fallen away.
   They include left-leaning activists who dreamed of social and
economic reform and military officers who believe their revolt
against Marcos was taken over by old-style politicians in
revolutionary guise.
   Mrs. Aquino's vision of the Philippines was the restoration of
democratic institutions: Congress, a liberal constitution and an
independent judiciary. Critics say that was not enough in a country
ravaged by poverty, social injustice and corruption.
   ``I will not join the celebrations because I think there is no
cause for celebration,'' Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said. ``They really
wanted change for the country, but ... nothing is clear and our
future is still dim.''
   As defense minister, Enrile led a mutiny against Marcos on Feb.
22, 1986, that prompted civilians to fill the streets, protecting
the mutineers from soldiers loyal to Marcos.
   Enrile later turned against Mrs. Aquino. She fired him as defense
minister Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, another key figure in the 1986
revolt, said Saturday the government had not had sufficient time to
achieve all the revolution's goals.
   ``We should not be discouraged,'' Ramos told reporters. ``We
should not listen that our government is on the brink of collapse
and that the Filipinos cannot do it.''
   Left-leaning activists say Mrs. Aquino tolerates military abuses
of civil rights in the 20-year-old war against communist guerrillas
and has not pressed land reform and other social programs.
   In a statement Thursday, the women's organization Gabriela
claimed she had ``completely turned away from the people who
installed her in power.''
   Arnel de Guzman, secretary-general of the Ecumenical Movement for
Justice and Peace, said Mrs. Aquino had installed ``mere trappings''
of democracy.

   The tents were empty, the applications lay
blank and all was quiet on the Texas border today, but immigration
authorities warned that thousands of Central Americans were ``lying
low'' and hoping for a lapse in tighter federal restrictions.
   ``I don't think they will stop coming,'' said Juan Bautista
Sanchez-Sanchez, a Nicaraguan who was detained after his application
for asylum was denied. He said he left home after being arrested and
beaten for marching against Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but for
political reasons and I think they will come if I tell them that
even if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' he
said.
   But for now, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's tough
new asylum policy has achieved its goal: a sharply reduced flow of
Central Americans across the Texas border. Patrol officers all along
the border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase in
illegal immigration, despite rumors that immigrants were shifting
their point of entry westward to Laredo and El Paso.

   Hunters call it the experience of a
lifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the American
frontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunt
a slaughter and a disgrace.
   More than 15 percent of the Yellowstone National Park buffalo
herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond
the park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permits
the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle.
   A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state was
mailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they can
come to Paradise Valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross
into Montana.
   ``If any animal, even a bloodthirsty Montana hunter, could be a
part of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I can't
believe it,'' said Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund for
Animals in New York. ``This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.''

   People who smoke to control their weight are
simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for
potentially deadly illnesses, according to a study published today.
   Smoking does reduce weight, the researchers acknowledged, but
flab stays around the waist, increasing the chance for heart
disease, diabetes _ and early death.
   ``If you're a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in
order to control your body weight, or a non-smoker considering
starting up again ... you're making a bad decision,'' said Dr.
Reubin Andres, a co-author of the study and clinical director of the
National Institute on Aging in Baltimore.
   ``There's no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much
greater than the risk of a few (excess) pounds of body weight,'' he
said.

   Democrats and Republicans alike say they are
concerned that the White House forced Health and Human Services
Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan to forgo nearly $300,000 he was
entitled to from his medical school job.
   ``I feel what is being asked of you has not been asked of others
in the past,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, which endorsed Sullivan on a 19-0 vote
Thursday.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., agreed, saying, ``It is grossly unfair
to him. ... My hope is we can reopen this issue with the White
House.''
   The issue of Sullivan's severance pay from the Morehouse School
of Medicine in Atlanta came to light earlier this month when
President Bush was trying to fend off ethical questions about
several of his other top appointees.

   Democrats who control Congress now dominate the
means of getting there, having spent more money, raised more and
received more from special interests than the Republicans.
   The Federal Election Commission put the price tag for electing
the 101st Congress last year at $458 million, not appreciably higher
than it was to finance the campaigns of the 100th Congress two years
earlier.
   However, the commission, in a report issued Thursday, found that
the Democrats now have surpassed the Republicans in raising money
for Senate campaigns from political action committees. In the House,
the Democrats have widened the lead they held previously.
   One result is that Republicans suddenly are sounding like
threadbare populists, while Democrats say they have made peace with
the captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, once a champion
of ``trickle-down'' economics, spent the night in a housing project
as part of President Bush's mission to take ``inventory'' of the
nation's homeless and impoverished.
   Kemp toured housing alternatives for the poor and homeless
Thursday and slept at the Opportunity Towers, a federally supported
apartment complex for senior citizens and the handicapped.
   ``We wanted Kemp to see human faces,'' said Robert M. Hayes, a
lawyer for the Coalition for the Homeless who accompanied the new
housing secretary. ``Ten minutes on a steam grate is worth 50 white
papers.''
   ``I hope this touches his heart,'' Hayes said, ``but in any
event, his political future will be linked with his success in
battling homelessness.''

   A military jury spared a
U.S. navy captain serious punishment after convicting him today of
failing to help Vietnamese boat people who resorted to cannibalism
to survive.
   The jury of six Navy captains could have jailed Alexander Balian
for 90 days and made him forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three
months.
   Instead, they gave the decorated Vietnam War veteran a reprimand,
saying he erred last June 9 while his ship was in the South China
Sea but deserved no further punishment than to be relieved of
command, as he was in August.
   Balian, 48, claimed he had been made a scapegoat over the
incident and that ``heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get

   AFL-CIO leaders close their annual
meeting today confident that organized labor can present a united
front against Eastern Airlines if its mechanics go on strike next
week.
   The Eastern dispute dominated the federation's Executive Council
session this week, and the union leaders as their last major event
went to nearby Miami on Thursday for a noisy rally with the
Machinists outside the airline's headquarters.
   Federation President Lane Kirkland said organized labor would do
``everything possible within the law'' to ground Eastern, sister
carrier Continental Airlines and their parent company, Texas Air
Corp., in the event of a strike.
   The annual federation meeting ends after a closing council
session today devoted mostly to internal housekeeping and passage of
a few final resolutions on issues of concern to labor.

<TEXT>
   Midway through ``A Question of Attribution,'' a
sudden hush falls over the audience. The unthinkable, it seems, has
happened: Queen Elizabeth II has walked on stage.
   In fact, Her Majesty is actress Prunella Scales. But given the
public awe in which the queen is held, turning her into a stage
character is a daring ploy, unprecedented in mainstream British
theater.
   ``A Question of Attribution,'' with ``An Englishman Abroad,'' are
two plays by Alan Bennett which, under the combined title ``Single
Spies,'' have been a sellout since opening Dec. 1 at the
government-subsidized National Theater. The show reopens Feb. 28 for
a commercial run at, appropriately enough, the Queen's Theater.
   Bennett plays Anthony Blunt, the erstwhile spy who worked as
Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, and he is seen rearranging
paintings in the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace when the
monarch unexpectedly appears.
   ``If you don't believe it's her, you can't suspend your
disbelief,'' said Scales, 56. ``It gives one an extraordinary sense
of power on stage because of the way they (the audience) listen.''
   For there, capturing the queen's diction, bearing and demeanor,
is the diminutive actress best-known as long-suffering Sybil Fawlty
opposite John Cleese on the TV's wonderful ``Fawlty Towers,'' and
the conniving Miss Mapp in ``Mapp and Lucia,'' based on the E.F.
Benson novels.
   Scales admires Bennett's ``very cheeky bit of writing,'' but said
she was determined not to caricature the queen.
   ``There are lots of people jolly good at imitating the queen
rather better than me,'' she said. ``I thought it frightfully
important that (the portrayal) be as real as possible.''
   This Elizabeth is drily and slyly witty, every bit the softspoken
match for the singular spy in her midst.
   Blunt was unmasked in 1964 as a spy, the so-called ``fourth man''
alongside Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, all Cambridge
University classmates in the 1930s. In return for making a secret
confession to his interrogators, he was spared punishment and public
exposure, kept his job as the queen's art adviser and retired
honorably in 1972. In 1979, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
publicly named him a spy, whereupon he was stripped of his
knighthood. He died in 1983.
   It's not known whether the queen ever knew she was employing a
traitor, but Bennett's play subtly hints that she can detect human
forgeries as cannily as Blunt detects fake pictures.
   After ``40 Years On,'' with John Gielgud as a schoolmaster, and
the screenplays for two low-budget triumphs, ``A Private Function''
and ``Prick Up Your Ears,'' ``Single Spies'' confirms Bennett's
stature in the top rank of British writers.
   Meanwhile, TV viewers are being treated to a rerun of his
``Talking Heads,'' a remarkable series of monologues including
Maggie Smith playing an alcoholic wife of a vicar, and Bennett's own
devastating portrayal of a mentally disturbed middle-aged man.
   Bennett has used treason before to explore the English psyche in
``The Old Country,'' which cast Alec Guinness as an English defector
living in Moscow. ``An Englishman Abroad'' was first seen as a 1984
teleplay portraying the wretched life of another traitor, Guy
Burgess, in exile in Moscow.
   It depicts an episode in which Coral Browne, playing in
``Hamlet'' in Moscow, is visited backstage by Burgess, the drunk and
maudlin ``Englishman Abroad.''
   In the latest production, Scales plays Browne, while Simon Callow
is Burgess.
   Scales said both plays were ``about martyrdom, about people who
suffer for their convictions,'' and stressed that playing Coral
Browne offered distinct, but equal, challenges to playing the queen.
   ``With the Queen, you've got the tapes, the broadcasts and
everything,'' said Scales. ``I wish Coral Browne were as
well-documented.''
   Browne, 75, who starred most recently in the movie
``Dreamchild,'' saw ``Single Spies'' on its opening night. The
queen, to date, has no plans for a visit.
   Felicity Murgo-Smith, a Palace spokeswoman, said: ``I can't
possibly tell you whether she's seen it; we have no notes of her
private visits. The queen takes a great interest in what's going on
in this country.''
   Murgo-Smith said no permission was necessary for Bennett, or
anyone else, to put the Royal Family on-stage: ``Stage censorship in
this country finished some time back,'' she said.

<HEAD>United States Helps Rebuild Egyptian Mosques</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is helping to finance
reconstruction of four mosques from Cairo's rich Islamic past, in an
effort to preserve the city's heritage.
   Egyptian and American officials said the $1.3 million project is
miniscule by the standards of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Egypt, where it administers economic aid of more than
$865 million. Only Israel gets more.
   But the three-year project to rebuild the historic mosques also
unlocks the door to further use of American development money for
Egypt's famous monuments.
   Often overshadowed by more famous pharaonic monuments, Cairo's
Islamic heritage is second to none. But squeezed by an
ever-expanding city and gutted from below by a rising water table,
many of the 520 remaining Moslem monuments are in danger of
crumbling.
   Marshall D. Brown, the USAID director in Cairo, did not rule out
future allocations for antiquities.
   The project's chief architect, Saleh Lamei Mostafa, said in order
to do the job to his expectations, he needs much more money. ``I
call these reconstructions rather than restorations, because so much
work has to be done,'' he said. ``I could use three times as much
money, but I'll do the best I can.''
   Mostafa said the most challenging of the four mosques, al-Zahir
Baybars al-Bunduqdari, is so decrepit that it accommodates fewer
than three dozen worshippers for Friday prayers. When he finishes,
he said, 10,000 to 12,000 will pray there.
   ``All the worshippers will be thanking the Americans for this,''
he said.
   The project's budget of 3 million Egyptian pounds comes from a
``host-country fund'' generated by sale of spare parts, machinery
and raw materials brought from the United States under the aid
program for resale in local currency. Brown said both Egyptian and
U.S. officials must approve outlays from the fund, which usually
totals about 700 million pounds ($304 million).
   In an interview, he said the fund generally finances development
projects. ``I think it seemed to us something that would seem
symbolically to tell the Egyptian people, `Hey, the Americans are
pretty sensitive to your historical and cultural past' and show
(our) support for it,'' he said.
   Brown said the project originated in 1987 when U.S. Ambassador
Frank G. Wisner and Ahmed Kadry, then chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization, agreed that something should be done to
restore the medieval historical part of Cairo.
   Fahmy Abd-Alina, antiquities director for Islamic and Coptic
monuments, said the Americans were given the names of the four most
historic and important monuments that could benefit from financial
aid.
   ``This is ... a great, large and difficult project that would
have taken up too much of our own money if we had financed it. ...
We're very grateful to the Americans,'' he said.
   Two of the mosques _ the early 16th-century Ghuriya and
15th-century al-Muayyad _ face a narrow, bustling thoroughfare
leading from bazaar to bazaar in one of Cairo's last medieval areas.
Once a marketplace for exotica-laden camel caravans, the picturesque
area provides the setting for the best-known works of Naguib
Mahfouz, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature last year.
   The atmosphere beckons tourists seeking 1001 Arabian nights:
covered alleys; donkey carts stacked with vegetables; street
peddlers balancing on their heads loaves of fresh-baked bread and
stalls where craftsmen stitch splotches of cloth into squares like
those once used to assemble the great Arabian tents.
   Another mosque, built by the Mameluke Amir Shaykhu in 1349, lies
in a separate part of Old Cairo within sight of the Citadel of
Crusader-fighter Saladin.
   The first reconstruction will be in the spring at Baybars mosque,
in a business and residential area about a 15-minute car ride from
downtown Cairo. Pumps have been working for months to lower its
water table before the reconstruction engineers can go to work.
   Dating from 1269, Baybars has a checkered history. It has housed
a bakery, soap factory, abbatoir and stables. Napoleon's troops used
it as a fort, and later Ottoman Turks fired cannon from its ramparts
against rebellious locals.
   Today, few in Cairo even recognize Baybars as a mosque. Taxi
drivers call it ``the English slaughterhouse,'' because that's what
British overlords used it for until early this century.
   Mostafa specializes in Islamic architecture and formerly taught
at Beirut University. In preparation for the project, he has been
studying plans left by workers who built Cairo's Islamic monuments,
including 10th-century manuscripts left by Persian artisans, and
drawings by traveling artists in the 1800s when much of the old was
still alive.
   A major architectural challenge in Baybars will be to fashion a
pine-wood dome covered with lead sheets to replace the missing
original, which towered 60 feet from the floor.
   He hopes to gather enough strong wood from demolished houses to
rebuild the dome. Wood for the original came from Jaffa in what is
now Israel, which Baybars seized from the Crusaders in 1268.
   Baybars, one of the strongest Mameluke rulers, is said to have
designed the enormous mosque himself to use as a rest house while
playing polo on the grounds. He looted stone columns from monuments
throughout Egypt for decoration.

<HEAD>Funny, Offbeat Comedy Special Marks Eddie Murphy's Producing Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon it will be possible to make a TV program
that makes fun of TV programs that make fun of TV, but Eddie
Murphy's production company has found at least one more interesting
and funny way to spoof its very own medium in ``What's Alan
Watching?'' tonight on CBS.
   Murphy returns to television in a very funny cameo as James
Brown, but mostly his credit here is as executive producer.
   The hour-long sitcom combined with video sketches, ``What's Alan
Watching?'' is the first production of Eddie Murphy Television in
its deal with CBS. Well, so far, so good. It was written by former
``Saturday Night Live'' writers Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield
and Bob Tischler.
   Woven through the sitcom premise is a satire of movies of the
week, game shows, commercials, documentaries. A rapid montage of
these is presented to 17-year-old Alan Hoffstedtter (Corin ``Corky''
Nemec) who plops in front of the set with the remote when he wants
to get away from the rest of his wacky family.
   First, there's older sister Gail (Fran Drescher), who mooches off
mom and dad and waits for her divorce from Juan to become final so
she can marry slobbish carpet-cleaning magnate, Leonard Kling, ``the
Carpet King,'' (Rob Bartlett) whose motto, which he often
graphically demonstrates, is ``so clean you could eat off it.''
   Alan's brother Jeff (David Packer), a Porsche salesman, is in
love with his sleek 912 Turbo _ and any other material possession he
can acquire. ``Did I tell you I'm thinking about getting a fax
machine?'' he excitedly asks dad at dinner.
   Dad (Peter Michael Goetz) is in the corrugated cardboard box
business. He tries to explain to Alan why Jeff is so mean by
explaining ``sometimes a box comes off the assembly line a little
skewed.''
   ``That's why I love my dad,'' Alan says in an aside, ``these
incredible box analogies.''
   Meanwhile, Mom (Barbara Barrie) teaches tap dancing to
neighborhood youngsters.
   ``My parents tell me I watch television to escape,'' says Alan as
a 7-year-old would-be hoofer wails ``Mammy'' in the living room.
``What would I possibly want to escape from?''
   The sitcom plot manages to be very funny on one level, rather
poignant on another. While mom and dad yearn to spend worry-free
golden years at the sunny retirement village of their choice, the
older kids regress, moving back home when they can't make it in the
outside world. Alan, facing the uncertainties of a far-away college
next year, is torn between going off to school and staying in
Philadelphia to be near his high-school heartthrob.
   When he escapes to the TV room, Alan is regaled with an amazing
array of video sketches that, when interspersed occasionally with
actual clips of television shows, make the real things look like
jokes. There's an ad for a hard-hitting news report on ``pit
babies;'' a documentary on Mr. Ed, complete with celebrity
recollections, such as George Carlin's paean, ``While we were still
telling jokes, Ed was working conceptually;'' a commercial for an
upcoming extravaganza _ ``Coming Sunday to the Brendan Byrne Arena _
it's `Gandhi on Ice!'''
   Murphy makes a cameo appearance in heavy makeup as James Brown
starring in a CBS movie of the week, ``Soul on the Rocks,'' in which
Brown goes to prison, an apparently intentional reference to real
life that allows Murphy, in a dual role as a protester, to chant,
``Free James Brown!'' while moonwalking.
   Eventually, the people on television give Alan advice on what he
should do. Dick Smothers says go away to the big university. Gandhi
says stay in Philadelphia. The remote control leads Alan to
``Jeopardy!'' ``Alan's Family for 400,'' says a contestant. Alex
Trebek intones, ``A selfish cretin, he was kicked out of locksmith
school when he couldn't open his lunchbox.'' Correct question: ``Who
is Alan's brother, Jeff?''
   In keeping with the hipness of the hour, the surreal ending is
very funny and thankfully leaves the end unpat _ perhaps suitable
for a weekly series.

   CELEBRITY RESTAURANT REVIEW _ Lou Gossett is now a big-shot TV
star in ABC's ``Gideon Oliver,'' but he used to sling dogs at
Nathan's hotdog stand out on the boardwalk in Coney Island as a
youth, and he has strong opinions on the state of the famous franks.
When he worked there, he said during a break in filming in New York
recently, ``when you cleaned the grill you only cleaned it 80
percent, and when you put new oil in the french fries, you left some
of the stuff in there so there was a buildup over the years of a
flavor. You didn't always clean it spotless. Then the health
department said that wasn't good enough anymore. I think it affected
the flavor.''

<HEAD>NBC's `A Different World' Is Most Improved Show of Year</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If television gave awards for the most
improved show of the season, this year's would have to go to NBC's
``A Different World'' and to producer Debbie Allen.
   In its debut season last year, ``A Different World'' was
ballyhooed as a spinoff of ``The Cosby Show,'' and slotted right
behind that hit comedy, it produced huge ratings, frequently landing
in first or second place in the Nielsens. Critically, though, it was
a big yawn.
   The show was a vehicle for Lisa Bonet, one of the ``Cosby'' kids
packed off to college. The show was designed to appeal to younger
audiences.
   ``I was brought in to turn it around,'' said Allen, who
previously helped make ``Fame'' a hit in syndication. ``I was also
to help with the morale problem on the set. People were unhappy. It
wasn't a company that had a central binding force. One of my main
assignments was to make the show about something that was relevant.''
   The most interesting character on the college campus was Whitley
Gilbert, a spoiled debutante played by Jasmine Guy. This season,
Whitley got the limelight when Bonet became pregnant and left the
show.
   Allen said she was sorry that Bonet had to leave and would
welcome her back. ``I don't think she'll be back,'' she said.
``She's had her baby and is getting used to being a mama.''
   Allen said she was happy that the show had become good enough
that the Rev. Jesse Jackson had agreed that morning to appear on the
show. His episode is to be taped in March for airing in April.
   Allen also has a special on ABC this Sunday and her first album,
``Special Look,'' is due out in April from MCA.
   ``So many exciting things are happening I'm getting on the
Princess Di level,'' said Allen, who talked in her office at the
CBS-MTM Studios where the show is filmed. ``Everything I've been
working on for a long time is coming to fruition. My real forte is
that I've been able to keep up with my own growth pattern. I have
been consistently able to keep up with my ambitions, my talents and
my abilities.''
   When she was hired as producer-director of ``A Different World''
the first thing she did was review the physical look of the show and
talk to the writers about the stories.
   ``I looked at the tape of every show,'' she said. ``I wanted to
know what I was getting into. I took notes on everything. Then I
came up with my own ideas, since I'm a graduate of Howard
University. I felt the show needed to be upgraded to a more mature
level of talking and thinking. We couldn't have a show about young
people that didn't deal with the things going on in this country.
Teen-age pregnancy, student uprisings, voting and other issues.
   ``We also added some new students. I wanted Whitley to have a
roommate so she would have to share. I also changed the makeup and
hairstyles. I wanted the women students to look fresh. They looked
too much like starlets in Hollywood. I wanted them to be more like
real people.''
   ``The Debbie Allen Special'' on ABC this Sunday, stars Whoopi
Goldberg, Robert Guillaume, Little Richard, Spike Lee, Philip
Michael Thomas and Phylicia Rashad, who is Allen's sister and plays
Bill Cosby's wife on ``The Cosby Show.'' Allen's husband, Norm Nixon
of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, is co-executive
producer and makes a brief appearance.
   ``I take a song from my album and put Phylicia in it,'' Allen
said. ``I make her wear a hot dress and move her body. She had men
all around her, and she loved it. I do a number with Philip Michael
Thomas that is so hot. We had to send it to Standards and Practices
for approval.''
   Allen said she wrote the lyrics for three songs on her album. A
video for the album is being developed.

Bobby has the only source of food or drink, a precious case of
expensive wine. Only ``Gunsmoke,'' with 402, and ``Bonanza'' with
318, have had more episodes. Meanwhile, CBS' ``Falcon Crest,'' also

   Prices and interest rates are rising, economists
are shaving their growth forecasts and many Americans are putting up
the storm shutters, preparing for the economy's version of winter.
   But, while the portents are ominous, this isn't necessarily the
prelude to winter, particularly so severe a winter as that which
plagued the economy in the late 1970s and led to the deep-freeze
recession of 1981-1982.
   There are some differences. There are even some encouraging
breaks in the clouds, enough so that some observers remain convinced
inflation isn't an immediate threat. Among them, it seems, are some
in the White House.
   Moreover, while few economists would claim that a slowdown could
be made without pain, a growing number seem to believe that future
economic extremes can be constrained, and that pain need not be as
intense as in the past.
   More and more of them talk about such things as ``rolling
readjustments,'' in which recessions in some geographical areas are
accompanied by good times in others, and downturns in some
industries are offset by upturns in others.
   But aside from this broad factor, there are some specifics that
lend encouragement.
   There remains, for example, a good deal of price competition in
goods, as demonstrated by Sears, Roebuck's plan for ``everyday low
pricing,'' a policy under which tags on some items will be cut 50
percent.
   The car companies are competing, especially through rebates and
subsidized interest rates. Moreover, inventories are sufficiently
large to all but assure a continuation of this discounting through
much of the spring and summer.
   If that isn't enough to keep some prices in line, then global
competition might come into play. Long gone are the days when
American companies could ignore foreign competition. Now,
overpricing means lost market share.
   Another factor, consumer resistance, is evident in various areas
of the economy. For several years, for instance, it seemed there was
no limit to increases in housing prices. Now, some asking prices are
being cut.
   American production efficiency is still another factor. Billions
of dollars have been spent on improved plant and equipment in recent
years, and that means manufactured products are being turned out at
relatively lower costs.
   Technological changes and ingenious software, for example, have
vastly raised the power of small computers without equivalent
increases in price. And those improvements are destined to continue,
since high-tech investment is up.
   A changed work ethic now helps to reduce inflationary pressures.
Wages in the past few years have been limited roughly to
productivity increases, a contrast to the 1970s, when they outpaced
productivity and fueled inflation.
   Still another factor that makes 1989 much different from a decade
or so ago is the very manner in which the Federal Reserve has been
acting. Rather than waiting for evidence of inflation, the Fed began
its attack in advance.
   Way back in March 1988, Fed economists reasoned that the growing
labor and industrial capacity shortages eventually would begin to
force up prices, even if the evidence was not conclusive at the
time. The Fed began raising rates.
   Ever since then it has had its foot on the brake, keeping the
economy from roaring out of control. In effect, it has been muting
the inflationary danger bit by bit rather than delaying action and
being forced to come down harder.
   That was not the case in the early 1970s, when inflation thinking
became so habitual that carmakers made no effort to hold down wages,
confident they could pass on their expenses in higher prices. It
took years to uproot that attitude.
   In contrast, today's Fed has acted pre-emptively, attacking the
inflation problem before it developed strongly, dosing it with high
interest rates before it has had a chance to grow into a monster.

<HEAD>Hard Time and a Hard Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where drivers passing the
maximum-security Nevada State Prison see a grim, century-old
building of hand-hewn granite blocks and iron window bars, Disney
production people saw a set for Tom Selleck's next movie.
   They wanted a building with a forbidden look for ``Hard Rain,'' a
story set in a California prison in the early 1900s.
   Producer Robert Cort and director Peter Yates considered about 60
prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes
at the prison, located on the outskirts of the state capital in the
high desert of northwest Nevada.
   The Nevada facility was chosen because it had two yards, and ``we
could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our
work and our work wouldn't interfere with their security,'' said
Ellen Pasternak, the movie's unit publicist.
   Robin Holabird, deputy director of Nevada's film office, said
while the Disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison,
her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and
visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building.
   ``When they come scouting, we tell them we're interested and will
take extra steps so they know we're serious about making a movie,''
she said. ``If all we could offer them was a new jail, it could not
have been done.''
   With ``Hard Rain,'' Nevada joins a growing number of governments
marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars
local economies can generate from Hollywood movie-makers looking
beyond California for new locations and lower production costs.
   ``We've got lots of competition when it comes to prisons,'' said
Bill Marsden of the Ministry of Culture film board in Alberta,
Canada, which tried unsuccessfully to attract the Disney Co. by
offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a
neighboring jail as extras for ``Hard Rain.''
   ``Now there are so many film commissions that when producers send
out circulars saying they're looking for a prison, they're sorting
through photos for weeks,'' Marsden said.
   Ohio caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant
state penitentiary in Columbus in a ``Prison for Rent'' advertising
campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines.
   ``It described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece
of property: `complete with electric chair,''' said R.J. Cavallaro,
assistant manager of the Ohio Film Bureau.
   Ohio stopped running the ``Prison for Rent'' advertisement a year
ago, Cavallaro said, partly because the campaign's success
stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies.
   ``We do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that
filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies, but we also
have to promote the rest of a very diverse state,'' he said.
   Iowa state officials recently began an aggressive campaign
promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9,000
movie makers, according to Wendell Jarvis, director of the Iowa Film
Office.
   ``We've had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they
brought in several million dollars in a short period of time. We
want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work
for Iowa people,'' he said.
   Jarvis said Iowa wardens were enthusiastic about advertising
their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons.
   ``They realize they're part of our economic development effort
just like anyone else,'' he said.
   Arizona's chief warden no longer allows movie-makers in the
Arizona State Prison at Florence, once a popular location for films,
because of security and discipline concerns, according to William
McCallum, director of the Arizona Motion Picture Office. McCallum
now passes requests for the Florence prison, featured in ``Stir
Crazy'' and ``Raising Arizona,'' on to states with available prisons.
   ``We've probably lost millions of dollars because we can't get
the business,'' he said.
   In addition to money the local Nevada economy can expect to make
from ``Hard Rain'' when Disney hires local workers and buys
supplies, the Nevada State Prison itself will get economic benefits
from the movie, according to Lt. Mike Budge, a prison official and
consultant for the movie.
   ``They had to give something to the inmates, and they're donating
money to the inmate welfare fund, and with that money we're
purchasing recreational equipment,'' he said.
   Budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of
inmate denims Disney is supplying for the movie.
   ``They're also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing
and razor wire because they want it to look more confining, and that
only adds to our security,'' he said.
   The announcement that Disney planned to make a movie at the
prison also improved discipline among inmates, 300 of whom will be
hired as extras, Budge said.
   ``Nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in
the movie,'' he said.

<HEAD>New York Satire Ribs British Hits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Les Miserables'' is getting ribbed in the city
that made the musical a hit, as New York's gleefully poisonous
``Forbidden Broadway'' strikes sparks in London.
   Also under the satirical gun are ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
``Cats'' and Cameron Mackintosh, who produced both hits. They're
just some of the British targets now being lovingly lampooned on
home turf.
   The long-running spoof of the Broadway theater scene, which has
been playing on and off in New York since its 1981 bow at an upper
Westside supper club, opened March 2 at London's Fortune Theater.
   ``Forbidden Broadway: The West End Edition'' is the latest
incarnation of a mini-musical revue that has made a cottage industry
out of creator Gerard Alessandrini's skills at parody.
   ``This show has pulled me out of poverty,'' said Alessandrini,
34, a graduate of the Boston Conservatory of Music who was in New
York waiting tables when ``Forbidden Broadway'' clicked.
   In eight years, his show has ballooned from a two-person
nightclub act at Palssons in Manhattan to a full-fledged London show
in a 440-seat West End theater.
   Last fall, a revised New York production opened to rave reviews
in larger premises _ the 130-seat Theater East.
   It's more than Alessandrini ever dreamed would happen, and
requires him to maintain a sharp lookout for new trends to spoof.
``You've got to keep up, almost like a critic,'' he said. ``You
listen to the theater gossip, that type of thing.''
   However, he doesn't want to be known just as a parodist: ``I like
to think of the show operating on different levels. If audiences
listen, it's informative about the theater ... and it at least works
on a musical level.''
   Targets under attack from his five-member New York cast range
from Patti LuPone and Madonna to Mackintosh and B. D. Wong, the
Tony-winning star of ``M. Butterfly.''
   A four-person London cast will perform about 25 percent of the
New York material. There's a duet spoofing musical divas Mary Martin
and Ethel Merman, and a ``Les Miserables'' parody that abbreviates
the 3 hour and 15 minute musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's epic
novel into a chaotic, pell-mell 10 minutes.
   Other numbers come from the repertory of 150 accumulated over the
years, and some were written especially for the West End.
   In the last category are ``The RSC Gavotte,'' referring to the
government-subsidized Royal Shakespeare Company, and a piece about
the British theater's obsession with spies, as currently seen in
Alan Bennett's hit, ``Single Spies.''
   There's also a song lampooning the London stage's plethora of
productions of ``Richard III.''
   ``Brush Up Your Richard'' is sung to the tune of ``Brush Up Your
Shakespeare'' from Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
   Because of the constant two-way theater traffic between London
and New York, Alessandrini is confident the American material will
work here. He already looks forward to the parody potential of ``M.
Butterfly,'' which opens in London April 20.
   Budgeted at $375,000, Alessandrini's show breaks even at a
staggeringly low 14,000 pounds ($25,000) a week, or 55 percent
audience capacity.
   ``We couldn't have done `Forbidden Broadway' off-Broadway for the
London price,'' said the show's American producer, Jack McQuiggan.
   Last season, McQuiggan produced an English play, Simon Gray's
``The Common Pursuit,'' on the West End following success with the
play off-Broadway. Neither he nor his partner, Joan Stein, is
involved with ``Forbidden Broadway'' in New York.
   An unrelated London theater spoof, ``Wicked Lips,'' proved a fast
flop last year when its British creators failed to clear the
necessary rights.
   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer of ``Cats'' and ``The Phantom of
the Opera,'' has so far refused to approve mockeries using his
melodies, so Alessandrini's show parodies him with its own tunes.
   But ``Forbidden Broadway,'' happily, has other fans where it
counts. Mackintosh has put his money where Alessandrini's mockery
is: He's invested $7,500 in the show.

<HEAD>Turning ``Blaxploitation'' Upside Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1980, 50 stand-up comics tried their luck on
``Audition Night'' at New York's Improv. Two were Robert Townsend
and Keenan Ivory Wayans. They quickly became friends and ended up
co-writing ``Hollywood Shuffle,'' a film largely financed by
Townsend's credit cards that turned into one of last season's
surprise movie hits.
   Now Wayans is showcasing his own talents by writing, directing
and starring in ``I'm Gonna to Git You Sucka,'' a takeoff on the
``blaxploitation'' films of the 1970s.
   ``A few years ago, me and some friends were sitting around and
talking about the movies we used to go see,'' Wayans said in a
recent interview. ``The conversation went from, `remember this
movie' to `remember this scene.' We started laughing and that was
when `Airplane' was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for
me.''
   Starting with the death of Junebug Spade from an overdose of gold
chains (``He was ready to die!'' the preacher boomed), ``I'm Gonna
to Git You Sucka'' takes on such movies as ``Superfly'' and
``Shaft'' and turns them upside down.
   Wayans, who also co-wrote and co-produced the Eddie Murphy
concert film, ``Raw,'' plays Jack Spade, who helps capture those
responsible for his brother Junebug's death. Assisting Spade are an
aging band of tough guys played by ex-football stars Jim Brown and
Bernie Casey and musician Isaac Hayes, who wrote the theme to
``Shaft.''
   ``That was the coolest thing,'' Wayans said. ``To be able to work
with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally
uninhibited. That's because they got it. They didn't take themselves
seriously. They were having a good time. In retrospect, they could
see where the humor was.''
   Fans of ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' will recognize John
Vernon, the dreaded Dean Wermer of Faber College. Vernon is the
villain again in ``I'm Going to Git You Sucka.'' He plays Mr. Big,
the man behind the proliferation of gold chains.
   ``My first choice was Shelly Winters,'' Wayans said. ``Initially,
it was still going to be `Mr.' Big but you wouldn't have ever seen
her face.''
   Wayans' project took a long time to get to the screen. When the
film was conceived in the early 1980s, he was a relatively unknown
stand-up comic and actor. It was a time when Hollywood studios were
not interested in financing an all black film. They were, however,
willing to reconsider if Wynans would agree to make a few ``minor''
changes.
   ``I went to Vestron and they kept coming up with the most bizarre
ways to integrate the cast they could think of. `How about if I get
Anthony Michael Hall (`The Breakfast Club,' `Sixteen Candles') to be
my younger brother _ a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house
and act black for the entire film?' ```And how about if we make one
of the guys like Charles Bronson.' They wanted so desperately to
integrate it they didn't care if they undermined the picture.''
   But the success of ``Hollywood Shuffle'' and Spike Lee's ``She's
Gotta Have It'' made the studios more receptive to Wayans' project
and he ended up getting United Artists to distribute the film.
   ``It was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk.
Before we did `Hollywood Shuffle,' if it was an all black act, no
one wanted to touch it.''
   Wayans grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan,
one of 10 children. He was trying to make people laugh as far back
as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents
at the family dinner table.
   ``There was always an audience and we were always competing,'' he
said. ``Dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at
each end. The objective was making the person across from you spit
food.''
   His early heros were Richard Pryor and the late Freddie Prinze,
who also grew up in Washington Heights. But while those comedians
had traumatic and tragic lives (Prinze committed suicide just as he
became a star), Wayans has no interest in being a ``tortured
artist,''
   ``It wasn't a psychological thing where I had a horrible family
life and I wanted the audience to love me,'' he said. ``There are
those who just find humor in almost anything, who have warped senses
of humor, which I'm a victim of. I just find everything funny and I
like being funny.''
   Although Mr. Big mutters ominously at the end of the movie that
``there will be no sequel,'' Wayans is anxious to continue making
films and also to help other blacks break into the business.
   ``The recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity
is tremendous,'' said Wayans, who found roles for Antonio Fargas,
Steve James and his brother Damon among others. ``There's a building
pool of talent right now.''
   But Wayans couldn't help adding, ``I used them all in the movie.''

<HEAD>Kafka Published, But Havel In Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franz Kafka is reappearing in print
in his native Prague after nearly 20 years. But Vaclav Havel, the
Czech dramatist well-known in the West, is in prison and his name is
nowhere to be found on shop or library bookshelves.
   Like much else in a nation caught between the pressures of Soviet
reform today and the Kremlin-imposed orthodoxy of the past,
Czechoslovak literature and the arts present a contradictory picture.
   Hesitant steps toward opening up the state-controlled arts have
returned a few previously unshown films _ including those by
Czech-born Academy Award-winner Milos Forman _ to the movie
theaters, put a handful of more daring plays on the stage and
``legalized'' some underground rock groups.
   This spring, Kafka's novels should go back on sale in Prague.
They had been banned under the Nazis, in the Stalinist 1950s and
were out of print again after the ``Prague Spring'' reforms were
crushed in 1968.
   Literary journals began publishing long articles on Kafka and
some of his notebooks last year, the first time in two decades the
author saw print apart from a collection of short stories published
for the 1983 centenary of his birth.
   But the new attitude to Kafka does not extend to anything or
anyone deemed a political challenge to the orthodox communists
installed by Moscow to rule after 1968. Michal Cernik, head of the
Czech Writers' Union, has said that emigre writers can be published.
   However, both he and official poet Karel Sys, editor of the
relatively outspoken literary weekly Kmen, referred swiftly to top
officials when asked in recent interviews if works by Havel or the
feted emigre writer Milan Kundera (``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being'') might appear soon in Prague.
   Communist party leader Milos Jakes, in a December interview with
the French daily Le Monde, spelled out why.
   ``Kundera is not a bad writer,'' Jakes said when asked whether
works written since Kundera went abroad in 1977 might be published
in Czechoslovakia. ``But he simply takes his specific attitude to us
and to socialism. ... We have many more such talents, but they ...
do not speak openly against socialism.''
   As an active member of the Charter 77 human rights group and a
writer who refuses to leave his homeland, Havel draws far more
official ire than any other cultural figure.
   He was arrested Jan. 16 and went on trial in February on charges
of sedition and obstructing a public official that could jail him
for 2{ years.
   The growing respect for the 52-year-old playwright among
intellectuals and others outside the tiny circle of active
dissidents inside Czechoslovakia is one explanation for the tough
move.
   Havel was feted when called to the stage at a folk music festival
in Lipnice last September, an action that later sparked official
reprisals against the festival host, music critic Jan Rejzek.
   He was the only dissident greeted by name _ with joyful chants of
``Long Live Havel'' _ when the authorities surprisingly permitted an
independent rally in Prague last Dec. 10.
   In contrast to the public silence in Czechoslovakia after Havel
and five other activists were jailed for subversion in 1979, his
January arrest prompted demonstrators in Prague to shout demands for
his release. More than 1,000 intellectuals who had never sided with
Havel in public before voiced the same demand in a letter urging the
communist authorities to open up to the society they rule.
   Further signs of a stirring in the arts are found in the Moravian
capital of Brno, where theater is far more lively than in Prague.
   But political activity carries its price in Brno, too. Eva
Vidlarova, an assistant director at a Brno theater, was detained in
December after organizing a petition to free another jailed cultural
activist, independent publisher Petr Cibulka.
   Fear of such repression leaves many Czech and Slovak
intellectuals wondering what to do to push for the greater freedom
most seek. Like many people in the Soviet bloc, they often retreat
into a private sphere of family, friends and interests. In that cozy
world, characterized by a leading economist as ``somewhere between
Nirvana and lethargy,'' they can pursue cultural activities for
small audiences or chase material comfort.
   In society at large, though, they must often work at jobs that
deaden initiative and cope with irritating consumer shortages _ once
rare in Czechoslovakia.
   As dissatisfaction mounts, official attempts at dialogue and
counsels of patience ring hollow to many.
   ``We know how bad the situation is,'' said Sys in an interview.
``We can discuss it for hours and days. But we live here and we have
to get out of it somehow.''
   There are extremes on both sides in the clash between the
communist authorities and independent groups, Sys said, advocating
dialogue as the solution.
   But intellectuals who attended a meeting with Prague Communist
party boss and Politburo member Miroslav Stepan after the petition
circulated on Havel said the increasingly isolated leadership still
seems unwilling to open up to the society it rules.

<HEAD>Talk of Okinawa: Royal Heir's Controversial Gift to Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAHA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The talk of Okinawa these days is about a gift
a royal heir has made to the district where he lives in Tokyo. It's
angry talk.
   Okinawans are angered because they feel the heir has given away
symbols of their golden age of independence long ago.
   Hiroshi Sho, the great-grandson of Okinawa's last king, has
chosen to give the Taito Ward in Tokyo his collection of more than
1,000 family heirlooms and the ownership of a royal tomb in Shuri,
once the seat of Okinawan royalty and now a neighborhood of Naha,
the capital of Okinawa prefecture.
   The tomb, called the Tamaudun, is a three-room structure with
limestone outer walls and sun-baked plazas of coral ground into a
fine, white sand. Generations of Okinawan royalty are buried there.
   Local reaction to Sho's decision, disclosed in December by a
Tokyo newspaper, has often been colored by lingering friction
between the majority Yamato Japanese, a broad term referring to most
of the inhabitants of Japan's main islands, and the Uchinanju, or
Okinawans.
   ``When I heard the news, it felt like the Yamato people had done
it to us again,'' said taxi driver Tamotsu Yonaha. ``It has hurt our
pride.''
   ``His (Sho's) wife is Japanese, so I guess it stands to reason,''
said an old woman selling herbal tea at a market. ``But it still
belongs to us.''
   A special session of the prefectural assembly was convened in
January, and after two days of discussion the assembly called Sho's
choice ``regrettable.''
   Statements of protest were issued by business leaders, civic
organizations and even some of Sho's relatives. Several small groups
have organized grassroots opposition.
   However, Yoshin Hirata, assistant director of the prefectural
Education Agency's culture division, said Tokyo and the Japanese are
not to blame. He credited Taito ward with trying to work out a
compromise.
   ``They don't want to have us glaring at them forever,'' he said.
   ``It seems that Sho simply wanted his estate to be kept near
home, which for him is Tokyo.''
   Sho also has told the Okinawan government that he believes the
Tokyo ward will make the collection more accessible to researchers
from all over the world.
   After being approached by Sho the Taito Ward, one of 23
administrative subdivisions in Tokyo, agreed to establish a
$2.4-million foundation to care for the objects and keep the
collection in one place. The ward has a population of about 177,000.
   ``Though disappointing, Mr. Hiroshi Sho believes that setting up
the foundation with Taito Ward is the best solution, and I would
like to respect his view,'' Gov. Junji Nishime of Okinawa said in a
statement.
   The 70-year-old Sho, who was born in Tokyo, refuses to meet with
reporters.
   Letters to the editor of the Okinawa Times, which has run dozens
of reports on the issue, have been strongly against the foundation,
according to senior editorial writer Akiko Yui.
   ``He has lived in Tokyo all his life, and I think he has little
affection for Okinawa,'' she said, noting that Sho's parents are
buried in Taito Ward.
   ``What the Okinawans are feeling is the irony that the descendant
of their king is no longer an Okinawan.''
   Sho is the great-grandson of Okinawa's last king, Tai Sho, who
died in 1901. Okinawa was unified into the Chuzan kingdom during the
15th century, and in its heyday traded with China, Korea and
Southeast Asia.
   In 1609, the kingdom was invaded by warriors from southern Japan
and required to pay taxes. The islands were incorporated into Japan
in 1879, ending the local monarchy. Members of the Okinawan royal
family were encouraged to move to Tokyo and marry Yamato Japanese,
which most of them did. Many Okinawans believe the royals were
forced to assimilate into Japanese culture.
   Okinawans have felt they were discriminated against over the
years by the Japanese. During World War II, attempts were made to
wipe out their five main dialects, which are often incomprehensible
to speakers of standard Japanese.
   Many Okinawans blamed the government in Tokyo for the heavy
fighting in 1945 on Okinawa, which was as close to Japan proper as
U.S. forces reached before the Japanese surrendered. More than
100,000 civilians died in the battle, which also claimed the lives
of 110,000 Japanese soldiers and 12,500 Americans.
   Following postwar occupation by the United States, Okinawa was
turned over to Japanese administration in 1972, 20 years after the
occupation of Japan had ended.
   ``The Japanese (emperor) gave Okinawa to America,'' said an
Okinawa Times editorial after Emperor Hirohito's death Jan. 7. ``The
descendant of Okinawa's (emperor) has, for free, given Tokyo's Taito
Ward Okinawa's possessions.
   ``We won't ask which crime is more serious. But to the people of
Okinawa there is just a feeling of misery.''

<TEXT>
   By condemning Salman Rushdie to death for
blaspheming Islam, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has acted decisively
to put the brakes on moderate trends in Iran.
   A decade after Khomeini led the Islamic revolution to power in
Iran, many of the country's senior figures are seeking greater
freedom and an end to Iran's political and economic isolation.
Factions also are jockeying for power, trying to position themselves
to take over after Khomeini leaves the scene.
   But the frail, 88-year-old ayatollah seized on the unlikely issue
of Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' to reassert his primacy
over the secular and liberal forces gathering momentum in Iran.
   His thunderbolt shocked many in the West. The decree that an
author in the late 20th century be put to death for a work of
fiction reverberated from European foreign ministries to Fifth
Avenue bookstores that stocked the novel.
   Diplomatic envoys were recalled, and writers marched in New York
and signed protests in Europe.
   A price of more than $5 million was put on Rushdie's head by two
Iranian clerics. The author fled to a safe hiding place and issued
an apology for sections of the book that could be considered
blasphemy of the prophet Mohammed.
   A stern and unforgiving Khomeini rejected any apology and renewed
his call for Rushdie's blood. He also denounced his own domestic
foes. ``As long as I am alive I will not let the state fall into the
hands of liberals,'' Khomeini vowed in a statement Wednesday.
   The ayatollah chose the issue and the timing of his assault.
   Controversy simmered over ``The Satanic Verses'' for months. In
October, the book was banned in India, the country of Rushdie's
birth. Demonstrations were staged against the novel in other
countries. On Feb. 12, six people were killed in Pakistan during a
protest over publication of the book in the United States. Two days
later Khomeini issued his condemnation.
   On the face of it, Khomeini's statement dramatically pointed to a
sharp swing back to revolutionary radicalism.
   Six months after an Aug. 20 cease-fire halted the war with Iraq,
the Iranian leadership is openly split. Khomeini sides with
hardliners who oppose demands for reforms in the country's
political, social and religious life.
   How far he will push that course is anyone's guess. Khomeini in
the past has used extremism and allegations of Western conspiracies
against Iran and Islam to crush internal discord and rouse
revolutionary zeal when he sees it flagging.
   The government has been paralyzed to a large degree by competing
power blocs whose rivalry had been masked by the need for a united
front during the traumatizing 8-year war with Iraq.
   So-called pragmatists led by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani have been seeking to end Iran's isolation and modernize
its economy.
   Opposing them is a curious mix of revolutionary anti-Western
hardliners, such as Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, and a group of conservative clerics
who bitterly resist change.
   ``We expected the situation would improve after the cease-fire,
but instead it has become worse,'' said a Western-trained Iranian
doctor, echoing what appeared to be widespread sentiments. He spoke
with a reporter on condition he not be identified.
   With the end of the fighting, some leaders have questioned what
the revolution has achieved and blamed government inefficiency as
much as the war for the hardships most Iranians face.
   The strongest criticism came from Ayatollah Ali-Hussein
Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor.
   He called for a candid re-evaluation of the revolution's
achievements and stressed the need ``to make up for past mistakes.''
   ``People in the world got the idea that our business in Iran was
murdering people,'' he added, in an apparent reference to reports
that thousands of dissidents have been executed by the regime in
recent months.
   Montazeri declared that ``instead of safeguarding the values of
the revolution we shouted slogans. Instead of providing value to the
people, we only made more and more of the intelligent and active
people more and more disgruntled and isolated.''
   Some Iranians had seen Montazeri's criticism as a sign of
imminent liberalization after 10 difficult years in which the
revolution survived bloody internal strife, the war and
international hostility.
   Khomeini's bitter denunciation of liberal trends and criticism of
the leadership dashed those hopes.
   The powerful ``bazaaris,'' the wealthy Tehran merchants who still
have a strong hold on the economy, have questioning the sincerity of
the liberalization process.
   ``They admit their mistakes, but they never do anything to
correct them and the biggest mistake is the continuation of the
mullahs (clerics) in office,'' one prominent merchant said.
   Nonetheless, Khomeini freed thousands of prisoners in a general
amnesty earlier this month and has permitted the formation of
political parties under legislation shelved during the war. How
freely those parties will be able to operate is questionable.
   On the economic front, Iran faces a massive reconstruction that
officials estimate will cost at least $400 billion. Shortages of raw
materials, because of import restrictions to save foreign currency,
have left hundreds of factories operating at 30 or 40 percent of
capacity.
   The main shopping precincts are crowded with bargain-hunters
until late in the evening, even when whole city blocks are suddenly
plunged into darkness by the frequent electricity cuts.
   The mounting problems have left Iran's 50 million people
uncertain of their future and hungry for better days after all the
hardship and heartbreak.

   Lesbia Rocque and her three children
hitch-hiked from Nicaragua, carrying with them nothing but hunger
and hope.
   At the end of the three-month odyssey, launched by a military
summons for her 12-year-old son, the family waded across the Rio
Grande and asked for asylum at a rural barbed-wire-encircled
government compound _ America's new Ellis Island.
   Instead, they were rejected, then arrested.
   After resigning his Nicaraguan government job over differences
with the Sandinistas, Ramon Aguirre tried to open a business in
Managua, but the government shut him down.
   Unable to sleep, unable to feed his wife and daughter, Aguirre
and his family headed north, only to be robbed three times in Mexico
and arrested at the U.S. border where they, too, asked for asylum as
political refugees.
   Now the Aguirres share a pale green 12-by-12 foot room with
another Nicaraguan family at a converted government agriculture
warehouse, where aliens do their wash on stones and children line up
for juice from Red Cross workers usually dispatched to natural
disasters.
   ``I didn't think it was going to be like this. I can't go back _
they'll kill me,'' Aguirre said through a translator. ``I don't know
what's going to happen to us.''
   What is going to happen?
   After months of a massive influx of Central Americans and weeks
of wrangling over changing U.S. policy on how to handle them, that
question remains unanswered, though officials see a few certainties:
the human flood will continue, possibly underground, and it will
strain local areas' ability to provide for the newcomers.
   As many as 100,000 Central Americans may enter the United States
this year, officials say. Most wade across the Rio Grande, where
clothes, letters to God and even an unused airline ticket can be
found on the grassy banks, left behind in haste or happiness.
   They seek a new life in a new land, sometimes following a dusty
road to Casa Oscar Romero, a church-run shelter, sometimes never
making it past the river's edge before arrest by the Border Patrol.
   After a policy change last week, they most often end up living in
detention, either under Army-green tents surrounded by barbed wire
at a military-style base, or at the converted warehouse, where
children play in the yard, fathers line up to use the single pay
phone, mothers try to fight off boredom and uncertainty.
   Some spend the chilly nights huddled under blankets in a shabby
old shed with red plastic walls on two sides.
   Refugees seeking political asylum _ more than half of them
Nicaraguans _ were at first turned loose while their applications
were processed, free to join friends and relatives in Miami or Los
Angeles, New York or Houston.
   In December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
restricted the asylum-seekers to south Texas, but that produced a
squalid squatters camp.
   Now, aliens are given a single interview that can be as short as
10 minutes and, after being denied asylum the same day, they are
arrested and held on $1,000-$4,000 bonds pending appeal.
   They pile up in detention centers here, the closest entry point
by land to impoverished and war-scarred countries to the south.
Central Americans now outnumber Mexicans trying to illegally enter
the country here by as much as 9-to-1 some days, Border Patrol
agents say.
   At the end of last week, more than 1,000 were being held at two
INS detention barracks here in the southern tip of Texas.
   The turmoil created by this eight-month-old influx is widespread,
even contributing to the racial tension in Miami that exploded in
riots during Super Bowl week.
   Local officials here and in Miami complain they can't provide
homes, jobs and schooling for this newest migration wave. Problems
with the shifting and sometimes contradictory policies, as well as
feeding and clothing the people detained here, continue to mount as
federal officials scramble to enforce an asylum law drafted in 1980
to accommodate 500 applications, not 100,000.
   Catholic bishops in Texas even likened the detention to
``concentration camps,'' and immigration experts say the current
plans are similar to how the thousands from the Mariel Cuban
flotilla were handled. The circus-like tents used for detention,
they say, could end up being permanent, and many here on all sides
of the issue agree that long-term solutions have yet to be proposed.
   At the heart of the matter, experts say, is a continuing paradox
over U.S. immigration policy, which has a tradition of welcoming
those less fortunate _ ``your tired, your poor, your huddled
masses,'' as the Statue of Liberty's inscription says _ and yet now
turns away those in need.
   The Bush administration has tried to deter the barrage of
immigrants by loudly rejecting their political asylum applications.
INS officials say these immigrants flee poverty, not persecution.
   But critics of the policy say economics and politics were in fact
married by the Reagan administration, which used economic sanctions
and arms for the Contras to exert political pressure on Nicaragua
and devastate that nation's economy.
   ``When they thought about economic pressure, they never
envisioned this,'' said Jose Hinojosa, a political scientist and
immigration expert at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas.
   Those denied asylum will be deported, even to Nicaragua, after
appeals have been exhausted, the INS said.
   Refugees say their countrymen will keep coming, and those who
work with the refugees say these newcomers will go underground.
   ``Some people may simply try to go around the system. It's
happened before, it will happen again,'' said Sister Norma Pimentel,
co-director of Casa Oscar Romero, an internationally known shelter
for aliens. ``They won't stop coming. This is just going to make it
more difficult for them.''
   The Central American stampede is not only the result of continued
economic deterioration there, but also a 1987 memo from
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   Meese directed INS officials to issue work permits to Nicaraguans
while their political asylum applications were pending. Word
traveled back to Central America, and last summer, numbers of
immigrants began a swift rise.
   ``They created the boom,'' said Jonathan Moore, a Proyecto
Libertad attorney working with asylum applicants. ``They've lurched
from one extreme to the other.''
   Said INS spokesman Duke Austin: ``We think that a very
unfortunate sign was sent (by the Meese memo).''
   Unless an alien falls into a preference group either by family
relations or special skills, there is no way to legally immigrate to
the United States. Political asylum becomes the one legal way in.
   Now, attorneys complain that in its rush to slam the asylum door
shut, the INS is prejudging all asylum claims as ``frivolous'' _ the
term INS Commissioner Alan Nelson used to describe most claims _ and
rejecting endangered refugees.

   Moore spoke of a client interviewed for only 15 minutes, then
rejected. When the man talked of threats made against his life, the
interviewer said only, ``Uh-huh,'' Moore said.
   ``She didn't ask any questions. We think it's become a
meaningless process,'' Moore said.
   In the first week of speedy case resolutions, the INS rejected
all but two of 300 asylum applications. INS officials say each
applicant gets a thorough and fair interview, which can range from
10 minutes to several hours.
   Chris Garza, a Houston businessman, stood outside the INS
detention center near here last week and decided not to take his
mother-in-law from Nicaragua in to seek asylum. Instead, the family
will wait, live underground, and hope policies change.
   ``They come here to get help and they get thrown out. I don't
think it's right,'' Garza said.
   Mrs. Rocque, the Nicaraguan who came with her three children and
whose husband made it to Miami a year ago while the Meese memo was
in force, doesn't fear jail here as much as being sent home.
   ``Let them do whatever they want to me, but don't send me back,''
she said.
   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza says he's continually negotiating
with federal officials to protect health and public safety, and may
even bill them for services and, if necessary, for running schools
in the detention centers. There has been no crime wave as a result
of the influx, he said.
   ``Our fear is we don't want to be an open detention center,'' the
mayor said. ``We have one of the higher unemployment rates in the
country, but our economy is improving now. We see lots of positive
movement then all of a sudden we are faced with a policy decision
made by our own government that puts those things in jeopardy.''
   Garza and others hope the situation won't amount to a repeat of
Mariel, where nearly 125,000 Cubans came to Florida in 1980 and were
placed in detention camps until they were resettled with relatives
or sponsors.
   About 8,000, mostly mental patients and accused criminals, remain
in detention camps.
   What does seem clear about the Central Americans, officials say,
is that a permanent solution has yet to be put in place.
   ``The INS obviously believes it can reduce the flow of Central
American immigration by sending a `no-free-ride' signal. That may be
the case,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said. ``(But) we cannot
assume that we have taken care of the problem with this action.''
   ``The reality of the immigration problem is we have not dealt
with the deeper problem,'' Professor Hinojosa said. ``The problem is
as long as guerrilla wars continue, economies get worse and worse
and worse. ... If we wanted to do something about Central American
refugees we would create a Marshall Plan for Central America.''
   INS officials, while defending their policies, say they, too,
believe Congress must take another look at the asylum law.
   Only that might soothe the consciences of people here, many the
descendants of immigrants _ legal and illegal _ themselves.
   ``There is a lot of emotion here. On one side, you just have
people. On the other, it's the law,'' Mayor Garza said. ``I don't
know if I'd do anything different than what these people are doing
if my family was hungry and I couldn't work.''
   If the Central Americans should end up staying, those who have
worked with them say they are a bright, energetic, honest and eager
lot. According to immigration experts, they'll most likely succeed.
   ``My sense is they'll be good workers and good citizens. They've
been good citizens here,'' said Carolyn Carlson, a Red Cross
volunteer from Washington, D.C.
   ``What has happened traditionally, historically, is that people
have come over and been treated shabbily, and they take it,'' said
Hinojosa. ``They work their butts off and they never lose sight of
the American dream. It takes two to three generations to make it,

   Two major banks said they were raising their
prime rate half a percentage point to 11.5 percent, the second
increase in two weeks, lifting the benchmark interest rate to its
highest level since November 1984.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. announced first Thursday and was quickly
followed by Republic National Bank of New York. Economists said they
expected other major banks to follow suit Friday.
   The increases are effective Friday. The prime rate is a benchmark
for a wide range of business and consumer loan rates, including car
loans and adjustable-rate home mortgages.

   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods dropped 3 percent in January, the government said in a report
that some analysts said could portend a welcome slowdown in economic
growth.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that total orders fell $4
billion to a seasonally adjusted $128.06 billion last month, pulled
down by sharp declines in the volatile transportation and defense
sectors.
   Virtually all other major industrial categories were down as well.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
saying a separately regulated thrift industry may not be needed in
the future, told Congress that the Fed will make it easier for bank
holding companies to buy troubled savings and loans.
   Greenspan also said Thursday that the central bank and the
Treasury Department have arranged to support the Federal Home Loan
Bank system in the event of runs on S&amp;Ls.
   The Fed chairman's comments came as opposition to President
Bush's S&amp;L proposal grew among members of Congress fighting to
preserve a separate S&amp;L industry.

   Farley Inc. won a four-month battle for West
Point-Pepperell Inc. as the textile giant accepted a sweetened $3
billion buyout offer from the Chicago-based conglomerate.
   Pepperell and Farley said Thursday that Farley would pay $58 a
share in cash for Pepperell's outstanding stock and refinance
Pepperell's debt. The entire transaction would cost Farley $3
billion.
   Farley will contribute about $300 million in equity, with the
remainder being financed by $1.6 billion in high-risk, high-yield
``junk'' bonds and $1.2 billion in bank loans.

   Mid-February sales of U.S.-based companies' cars
and light trucks rose 1.7 percent from year-earlier levels as the
effects of sales incentives available in early 1988 began to wear
off, the automakers reported.
   The eight automakers said Thursday that they sold cars and light
trucks at an average daily rate of 36,769 during the Feb. 11-20
period this year, compared with a daily rate of 35,158 during the
same time last year.
   The overall sales rate during the period was bolstered by a 5.4
percent increase in truck sales, which offset a 0.3 percent decline
in car sales.

   Those soulful, animated dancing raisins have been
taking their bows for the California raisin industry for about 2{
years, but television viewers apparently still love them.
   The California raisin commercials led Video Storyboard Tests
Inc.'s annual list of most popular ad campaigns in 1988 for the
second consecutive year.
   The campaigns for Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, including a four-part ad
starring singer Michael Jackson and an ad with actor Michael J. Fox
trying to avoid a watchdog blocking the way to the soda machine,
placed second.

   The stock market eked out a small gain Thursday, steadying after
Wednesday's sharp drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
gained 5.53 points at 2,289.46.
   The dollar slipped lower as pessimism about the U.S. budget and
trade deficits weighed on the foreign-exchange markets. Gold prices
rose.
   Bond prices fell and short-term interest rates jumped.
   Renewed fears of inflation gave gold futures prices another lift.
Grain, livestock and energy futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Survey Rates California Raisin Ads As Most Popular Of 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television viewers rated the California raisin
industry's soulful animated commercials the best TV ads of 1988 for
the second consecutive year, but failed to spot any advertising
breakthroughs, a survey found.
   Dave Vadehra, president of the research firm Video Storyboard
Tests Inc., said Thursday that the most popular ads last year also
demonstrated a heavy reliance on safe standbys such as children and
dogs.
   Video Storyboard's 11th annual list of outstanding ad campaigns
put in second place the commercials for Pepsi and Diet Pepsi,
including a four-part ad starring singer Michael Jackson and an ad
with actor Michael J. Fox trying to avoid a watchdog blocking the
way to the soda machine.
   Ads for McDonald's restaurants ranked third. McDonald's spent an
estimated $386 million airing its commercials compared with $6.8
million spent by the California raisin industry.
   Vadehra blamed the lack of advertising breakthroughs on the
merger mania that has seen huge advertisers swallowed up in takeover
deals and advertising agencies consolidate after a massive
restructuring within that business.
   ``Nobody is taking any risks. Everybody is trying to play it
safe,'' Vadehra said.
   Richard Karp, director of creative services at Grey Advertising,
agreed that mergers unsettled the ad business last year, distracting
some advertisers while some ad agency people ``focused less on work
than on their security.''
   In a telephone interview from Los Angeles where he is judging
entries in an ad awards show, Karp said he found ``there were a lot
of safe hits and not a lot of home runs last year.''
   Video Storyboards compiled its ranking based on responses from
24,000 people who were asked periodically over the past year to name
the most outstanding television commercial they have seen in the
past four weeks.
   The California Raisin Advisory Board aired its first commercials
that use clay models of raisins, which appear to dance and sing to
``Heard It Through the Grapevine,'' in September 1986.
   The ads helped boost raisin sales and created a market for
licensed products ranging from raisin shirts to a raisin board game.
   Robert Phinney of the raisin board said sales of products
licensed to use the raisin characters amounted to $500 million last
year, just short of the industry's $600 million in sales of the real
thing.
   In 1988, the board aired a commercial featuring an animated Ray
Charles singing with the raisins. New spots are planned for this
fall.
   Phinney said the raisin ads remain popular because the characters
are depicted as entertainers rather than pitchmen. ``We have been
very conscious of not making them salesmen,'' he said.
   Vadehra said the California raisin industry also got credit from
some consumers for ads others did using the raisin characters.
   He said some consumers thought ads for Post Raisin Bran cereal
and Hardee's fast-food restuarants, which each have been licensed to
use the characters in their ads, were commercials for California
raisins.
   Ranked fourth behind the California raisins, Pepsi and McDonald's
campaigns were Bud Light beer ads. Vadehra said consumers cited ads
featuring the Bud Light spokesdog Spuds MacKenzie three times as
often as the ads that show amazing things that can happen when you
order a ``light'' beer.
   In fifth place were ads for Isuzu cars and light trucks featuring
the fictional lying pitchman Joe Isuzu, another campaign introduced
in 1986 and steadily gaining popularity.
   Miller Lite beer ads ranked sixth, followed by Coca-Cola soft
drinks, Stroh's beer spots featuring Alex the dog, Wendy's fast food
restaurants and Levi's jeans.
   Ads by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the industry's
volunteer anti-drug campaign, placed 11th. The group's trademark ad
is a raw egg dropped into a sizzling frying pan, meant to symbolize
the effect of drugs on the brain.
   Falling out of the top 10 campaigns were ads for Bartles &amp; Jaymes
wine coolers and DuPont Stainmaster carpets.

<HEAD>Sears To Close Stores To Slash Prices As Part Of Major Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. will close its 825 stores for
42 hours next week to roll back prices on more than 1.5 billion
pieces of merchandise, an unusual move prompted by the huge
retailer's restructuring.
   The stores will close from 6 p.m. Monday until noon Wednesday to
cut the prices on clothes, hardware, appliances, furniture and other
items to conform with Sears' new ``everyday low price'' strategy.
Some prices, such as those on beds, will be cut in half, while most
will be reduced by lesser amounts.
   ``We expect it to bring more customers into Sears, with more
reasons to shop us than ever before,'' Michael Bozic, chairman of
the Sears Merchandise Group, said Thursday.
   Bozic also announced a television, print and mail advertising
blitz to sell the concept to the public.
   Sears, which reported a profit of $1.45 billion on sales of
$50.25 billion last year, currently uses a strategy of frequent
sales on specific items to attract customers. Its new strategy,
while not new among retailers, is seen as a move to help the company
modernize its image and better compete with discount stores.
   As part of the new pricing system, Sears promises to match the
price of any competitor for brand-name goods advertised in
newspapers.
   Bozic said the stategy will improve the company's efficiency and
reduce the cost of inventory, distribution and promotion. He said
Chicago-based Sears also will run several sales each year.
   ``We will always have to clear goods,'' he said. ``There will be
the traditional efforts in July and after Christmas. (But) we will
have a lot more time to look for extra special products to sell to
customers.''
   As part of its restructuring, Sears said it also would offer
about 1,000 name-brand items, which it will sell alongside its own
Kenmore and Craftsman brands.
   Last October, Sears announced the plans to introduce daily low
prices at its stores. Edward A. Brennan, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer, said the move was part of an effort to make
the company more competitive.
   Sears' market share has eroded through much of the 1980s, as
discount stores, such as Wal-Mart and K mart, have grown.
   In addition to revamping its merchandising group, Sears also
plans to sell the 110-story Sears Tower, its headquarters, in a bid
to improve the company's earnings.
   The company says it will concentrate on consumer-oriented
businesses: retailing, insurance, residential real estate and
financial services.
   Thomas Morris, Sears' vice president of marketing, said the
retailer will mount a three-week advertising campaign touting the
new pricing strategy as ``the biggest change in Sears history.''
   ``Our goal is to reach everyone in America several times during
the launch,'' he said.
   One television ad shows shoppers stopping and looking around
perplexed as the sound of Sears' employees changing prices with
pricing guns fills the air.
   Bozic estimated the new pricing strategy could save the company
up to $200 million a year through reduced paperwork, inventory
handling and other related costs.
   Bozic said Sears, however, will not become a discounter.
   ``Sears doesn't fit into a discount box, or a specialty store or
department store box,'' he said. ``Our strategy is to be a store
with category dominance, supported by competitive prices, quality
products and great values.''

<HEAD>Farley Promises No Production Layoffs At Pepperell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Farley promises no production layoffs and
a reinvigorated company when he assumes control of textile giant
West Point-Pepperell Inc. within the next few weeks after a bitter
takeover fight.
   Farley, chairman of Farley Inc. of Chicago, won the company
Thursday when the Pepperell board of directors unanimously agreed to
his $58-per-share tender offer. The deal, when combined with
required refinancing of Pepperell debt, totals about $3 billion.
   The buyout will be financed with $300 million in equity from
Farley, $1.6 billion in high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds sold by
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and $1.2 billion in bank loans.
   Farley Inc. is one of the nation's largest privately controled
conglomerates. Its holdings include Fruit of the Loom Inc., the
nation's No. 1 underwear manufacturer; Acme Boot Co., which sell
Dingo and Acmes boots; and Doehler-Jarvis, which makes die-cast
metal products for the automotive industry.
   William Farley predicted that Pepperell, with increased
advertising and tighter management, could match Fruit of the Loom's
25 percent growth in the three years he has owned the company.
   Farley went out of his way Thursday to compliment Pepperell
employees.
   ``We know we cannot build a first-rate company without first-rate
employees, and I want to commend the men and women who work for West
Point-Pepperell,'' he said in a statement.
   The businessman has been the target of much criticism in the west
Georgia and east Alabama communities where Pepperell is the
principal employer.
   However, Farley told reporters in Atlanta he held no bitterness
toward the employees or management, including Chairman Joseph L.
Lanier Jr., who led the at-times bitter fight against Farley.
   ``I think Joe Lanier did not want Bill Farley to run West
Point-Pepperell and I understand that. He's fourth generation,''
Farley said, referring to Lanier's family ties to the West Point,
Ga.-based company.
   But Farley noted that Lanier apparently joined in a unanimous
decision by Pepperell's board to accept the offer.
   Farley said Lanier and President Donald Keller will leave the
company once the merger is complete, in about 30 days.
   Pepperell officials did not return phone calls Thursday, but
issued a joint statement with Farley saying directors ``determined
that the terms of the offer and the merger are fair'' to
shareholders.
   One of management's criticisms of Farley's offer was a fear he
would sell parts of the company to pay down the debt.
   Farley said Thursday, ``I love all the company and I haven't made
any decision on what part, if any, I would sell.''
   However, he later identified Saturday's, a high-fashion line
produced by Pepperell subsidiary Cluett-Peabody, as a likely
candidate to be sold.
   The companies said they agreed to cancel a special shareholders
meeting set for March 2. The meeting had been called at Farley's
request in a bid to unseat the Pepperell directors and replace them
with a board more sympathetic to the conglomerate's bid.
   Farley said his bid beat out ``two or three'' competing offers,
including one from management. He said he did not know the size of
the management offer.
   Farley fired the first shot in the battle for Pepperell last May,
when it notified the Pepperell it was seeking to buy up to 25
percent of its stock.
   However, Farley never reached that level, stopping at 9.8
percent, or 2.9 million shares, in order to prevent management from
activating so-called ``poison pills'' that would make a takeover
much more expensive. Those options do not become available until a
bidder acquires 10 percent of Pepperell stock.
   Instead, on Oct. 24, Farley initiated a hostile tender offer that
resulted in lawsuits and countersuits, as actions by state
legislators and U.S. congressmen, and television and newspaper
advertisements highly critical of the combatants.
   Farley's initial offer, $48 per share, later was increased to $52
per share. Farley said Thursday he had upped the ante to $56 after
the board put the company up for sale in an attempt to avoid a
Farley takeover.
   Pepperell, founded in 1886, became the nation's largest publicly
traded textile company last year through its $1.22 billion
acquisition of most of J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. Inc. Its latest quarterly
financial statement said the company had $994.6 million in long-term
debt.
   Pepperell has 41,000 employees and 22,000 stockholders.
   For the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, the company reported a profit
of $84.4 million on revenue of $2.15 billion.

<TEXT>
   Don't hang up so fast! This will make a
fabulous story _ I promise. We're gonna give you an exclusive
one-on-one interview with the new voice for Yogi Bear. Hey, you
still there?
   Journalists nationwide are bracing for calls like this. It seems
everybody has a publicist these days _ and bold press agents are
frantically working phones and fax machines to give their clients an
edge over the competition.
   Plastic surgeons, a mortuary, the Bulgarian film industry, a
psychologist, a doughnut shop and even Yogi's new voice now claim
publicists.
   In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest media market,
publicity is proving to be as important and often more economical
than normal promotions.
   Public relations wiz Michael Levine finds that ``for every ad
inch, an editorial inch is worth about 10 times the amount.''
   ``Public relations no longer belongs to just the big people,''
said publicist Debra Gold, who promotes local community-involvement
stories on behalf of Burbank's Valley Funeral Home. ``For small
businesses, public relations is so much more cost-efficient than
advertising.''
   The boom in smaller, regional publicity operations reflects a
national trend. Industry giant Hill and Knowlton collected fees of
$114.5 million in 1987, up 14.3 percent from 1986. Rival firm
Burson-Marsteller claimed revenue of $148.7 million in 1988, up 17.6
percent from 1987 billings of $126.4 million.
   Press releases and announcements herald the successes of the
Venetian blind, the California Raisins, law firms, hospitals and the
Beverly Hills High School.
   Joe Molina, whose JMPR firm stumps for Budget Rent-A-Car of
Beverly Hills, which specializes in exotic vehicles, estimates that
on annual public relations billings of $70,000, JMPR has delivered
up to $7 million worth of promotion for the rental agency.
   ``The media has generated constant word of mouth'' for the
franchise, Molina said, claiming story placement in Forbes, Newsweek
and the television shows ``PM Magazine,'' ``Today'' and ``Good
Morning America.''
   ``We built them (Budget) into something they wouldn't be
otherwise,'' Molina said.
   Charging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars a month,
press agents try to build a specific image for a customer, which
some clients believe advertisements can't always do.
   ``You can't be credible today without being visible,'' said
Levine, whose firm plugs the likes of Charlton Heston, Designer
Donuts and Tommy Tang, a local Thai restaurateur. ``With Tommy,
we're trying to establish a chef as a star ... in the (renowned Los
Angeles chef) Wolfgang Puck-type situation.''
   Publicist Levine himself has a publicist _ who promotes Levine's
``The Address Book,'' an index to help the star-struck find the
stars.
   Then there's mansion seller Mike Silverman and his publicist,
Jane Harman.
   Harman boasts that Silverman, one of Beverly Hills' most
successful and visible real estate brokers, has been featured on
``60 Minutes,'' ``USA Today: The TV Show,'' the Cable News Network
and in the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today,
Interview magazine and The Associated Press.
   The media exposure, she said, is aimed at making Silverman as
large a star as his bigwig home buyers, who include Zsa Zsa Gabor
and Kenny Rogers.
   ``A celebrity name is a very important commodity to people who
have the money to buy these kinds of houses,'' Harman said. ``My
primary goal ... is that he be seen as the ultimate realtor to the
celebrities.''
   News stories establish ``a mystique (and) the glamor. I think
we've been terribly successful with him _ but Mike has really made
his reputation on his own,'' Harman said.
   Some publicists can be a nuisance, but others can be invaluable,
especially when Hollywood celebrities land in the hospital.
   Ron Wise, a former entertainment critic for Daily Variety, heads
public relations and marketing at the 1,120-bed Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center. The hospital is where most of the city's movers and shakers
go for hospitalization _ for instance, Debra Winger and Diana Ross
delivered children there.
   Gary Busey, injured in a motorcycle accident in December, became
Wise's responsibility as soon the actor was wheeled into
Cedars-Sinai. For three days, Wise didn't sleep, fielding more than
50 calls about Busey and conducting several live radio interviews
each day.
   Wise also uses public relations, not advertising, to stress that
Cedars-Sinai is ``not a medical country club for the rich and
famous.''

<TEXT>
   Strong truck sales by U.S.-based automakers pushed
mid-February sales of cars and light trucks up 1.7 percent over a
year ago as comparisons of sales figures became less clouded by
incentives.
   Cars and light trucks made by the eight companies sold at an
average daily rate of 36,769 during the Feb. 11-20 period this year,
compared with a rate of 35,158 the same time last year, the
automakers reported Thursday.
   There were eight selling days during the period this year and
nine last year.
   ``There's nothing alarming one way or another,'' said Jeannette
Garretty, an auto analyst with Bank of America in San Francisco.
``It will probably mean that when the incentives come back, they
will not be drastic ones.''
   Sales early last year were heavily influenced by incentives such
as cash rebates and low financing deals. Incentives are in effect on
some cars and trucks this year, but they are being offered on a
narrower range of vehicles.
   The overall sales rate was bolstered by a 5.4 percent increase in
truck sales, offsetting a 0.3 percent decline in car sales.
   Although truck sales were significantly higher this year over
last year, the ratio of car-to-truck sales stayed virtually the same
during both periods. Light truck sales make up slightly more than 36
percent of all vehicles sold both years.
   For the year, car and truck sales by domestic producers fell 3.2
percent, to a daily rate of 32,334 in 1989, compared with a 33,412
daily rate last year. There were 42 selling days between Jan. 1 and
Feb. 20 this year, one fewer than during the same time last year.
   Cars made by domestic companies were selling at a rate 6.3
percent lower this year than last year, and truck sales have risen
1.5 percent.
   Chrysler Corp. showed a big dip in mid-February car sales,
falling 18.5 percent during the period this year compared with last.
The nation's No. 3 automaker said its average daily sales rate for
cars fell to 2,960 during mid-February this year compared with a
3,630 rate during the same time last year. Car sales for 1989 at
Chrysler were 15.1 percent below the rate through mid-February last
year.

   An investment group that includes oil
tycoon Gordon P. Getty says its $2.4 billion cash bid for Emhart
Corp. is friendly and it wants to meet with management soon to
discuss the proposal.
   But Emhart officials have said little since late Thursday's
surprise offer from New York-based Topper Acquisition Corp.
   ``Emhart's board of directors will carefully study the offer in
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisers,'' said
Peter L. Scott, Emhart chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``After completing this evaluation, the board will promptly
announce its conclusion and recommendation,'' he said. ``Prior to
that time, we strongly urge Emhart shareholders not to take any
action with respect to the offer.'' Topper offered $35 per share in
cash for all outstanding common shares of Emhart, which manufactures
a wide range of consumer and industrial products, including lawn and
garden equipment, hardware and materials used to make footwear.
   The Topper partnership includes Getty and New York real estate
developers Lawrence Fisher, 78, and brother Zachary Fisher, 77. The
deadline for the tender offer is midnight March 23.
   Emhart's stock closed at $32.75 a share, down 25 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Topper's offer was disclosed after
the market closed. Emhart's stock, though, has risen almost $10 a
share in the past month amid takeover rumors.
   One industry analyst said Topper's bid appears too good to refuse.
   ``The way their press release reads, they are making a tender
offer and they don't care what management thinks,'' said Rod Cerny,
chief investment officer at Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc.
of Omaha, Neb.
   ``But if you take into consideration that the stock one month ago
was selling at about $23 to $24, this is a premium of about 50
percent,'' said Cerny, who is a shareholder. ``We could hardly
imagine management feeling that this is some kind of undervalued bid.
   ``Our contention all along was that the company's value is in the
mid-30s,'' Cerny said.
   Cerny said Emhart, which has about 1,000 employees, is made up of
numerous subsidiaries that operate separately, making it ideal for a
traditional buy-and-bust-up takeover strategy.
   Such a strategy would allow the acquirers to borrow money to
complete the deal and then pay some of that money back by selling
off subsidiaries. He added that he didn't know whether Topper was
planning to do that.
   Topper, an investment vehicle created for the acquisition of
Emhart, notified Emhart that it would nominate a slate of directors
for the annual meeting scheduled for April 27. Depending upon the
board's response to the offer, it might conduct a proxy contest for
control of the board.
   Topper said in a statement that it would like to keep the
company's headquarters in Farmington and leave Emhart's management
in place.
   ``We strongly desire to negotiate an amicable transaction and we
would like to meet with Emhart management as soon as possible to
discuss our offer,'' Topper said.
   ``We believe our offer represents an opportunity for Emhart
shareholders to realize exceptional value. It represents a 43
percent premium over the market price of Emhart stock on Jan. 23,
1989, before the recent run-up of the company's stock,'' the
partnership said.
   ``Our objective is to acquire, own and operate Emhart, and to
continue to build its manufacturing businesses over the long term,''
they said.
   Topper also said it has lined up financing: Chemical Bank and two
other banks have committed $1.2 billion, and an affiliate of First
Boston Corp. said it would provide $1.1 billion in short-term
financing. The Fishers and Getty also plan to kick in about $300
million of their own money.
   The Fisher brothers are worth at least $800 million, Forbes
magazine has said. Their participation in a never-completed 1984 bid
for Walt Disney Productions, led by financier Saul P. Steinberg,
netted them $30 million.
   Getty, 54, gained his fortune through an inheritance from his
father, Jean Paul Getty, who turned his father's oil company into a
worldwide oil behemoth.
   Getty is worth at least $450 million and perhaps more than $1
billion, according to Forbes.

   Open-market interest rates for securities such as bonds and
Treasury bills also climbed today.
   While the rise in rates increased investors' worries about the

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board, ignoring critical
comments by the Bush administration concerning its
inflation-fighting efforts, today boosted its key lending rate to 7
percent from 6.5 percent in a move likely to trigger increases in
interest rates charged consumers.
   The central bank announced it was raising its discount rate, the
interest it charges on loans to member banks, ``in light of
inflationary pressures in the economy'' and after receiving requests
from 10 of its 12 district banks.
   The action, taken on a 6-1 vote with Fed member Martha Seger
dissenting, came just a day after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
issued the strongest critical comments yet by the new administration
regarding the Fed's efforts to push interest rates higher in an
effort to combat inflation.
   ``I don't see as strong evidence of inflation right now as does
the Federal Reserve,'' Brady told the House Banking Committee.
   Boosting the discount to the highest level in nearly three years
is the most dramatic inflation-fighting move the Fed could have
taken. Discount rate increases often signal that other short-term
loans, from adjustable-rate mortgages to automobile loans, will soon
become more expensive.
   Brady's comments followed several weeks of verbal jousting
between the administration and the central bank. President Bush on
several occasions has said that he believed the central bank was
overly concerned about inflation and should be more worried that
high interest rates could impede economic growth.
   Another member of the administration, budget director Richard G.
Darman, attempted today to get his colleagues to quiet their
criticisms. He said he believed it was ``extremely unhelpful just as
a general matter to have an overt, visible disagreement'' between an
administration and the central bank.
   He said such an open dispute ``tends to be unsettling to the
markets'' and generally harmful to prospects for economic growth.
   Darman commented during a budget briefing for reporters that was
interupted when an aide brought him a wire service story announcing
the discount rate increase.
   The increase came one day after two major banks _ Chase Manhattan
Bank and Republic National Bank of New York _ raised their prime
lending rates to 11.5 percent from 11 percent.
   Several other large banks raised their prime rates as well today
after the Fed's announcement. Both the dollar and stock and bond
markets moved lower in trading today.
   Banks use the prime rate as a base for setting rates on a wide
variety of business and consumer loans, including car loans and
adjustable-rate home mortgages.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York said
the Fed's action had been widely anticipated and there even was some
speculation the central bank might boost the rate a full percentage
point rather than a half-point. He said further tightening could be
expected as the Fed tries to control escalating prices.
   ``It was an appropriate action ... and does bring the Fed into
rough alignment with the amount of restraint needed to stay even
with the new inflation threat,'' Jones said. ``We are in the process
of accelerating (inflation) and it will require further Fed
tightening steps.''
   The Fed last raised the discount rate on Aug. 9, to 6.5 percent
from 6 percent. Today's increase was the third since Alan Greenspan
took over chairmanship of the central bank in August 1987.
   The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March 7, 1986, to
April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent. The rate bottomed at
5.5 percent in August 1986 and since then has been on the rise.
   The Fed's latest action follows two particularly worrisome
inflation reports for the month of January.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index jumped 1.0
percent _ a 12.7 percent annual rate _ and the Consumer Price Index
soared 0.6 percent, a 7.2 percent annual rate and the biggest jump
in two years.
   By increasing interest rates, the Fed hopes to slow down economic
activity and thus ease inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Fed member Seger, the sole dissenter to today's action, has
expressed concern that higher interest rates could slow economic
growth too much and hurt the ailing savings and loan industry.
   Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that an
increase of one percentage point in interest rates adds $3 billion
to $4 billion to savings institutions' operating losses.
   The Fed has been steadily nudging up interest rates since March
1988 in an effort to check inflation by slowing economic growth. The
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge among themselves
for overnight loans and is heavily influenced by Fed policy, has
risen more than three percentage points over the last year, topping
9.5 percent Thursday.
   In congressional testimony Wednesday, Greenspan called the latest
increase in consumer prices ``disturbing'' and blamed it in part on
recent acceleration in wage increases.
   He said price increases had reached unacceptable levels and could
increase the chances for and severity of a recession if not brought
under control.
   ``If inflation re-emerges, I think a recession will move up on us
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be
a prolonged one,'' Greenspan said.
   He maintained that the Fed's credit-tightening moves would
prolong the 6-year-old economic expansion and moderate the next
downturn.
   While many analysts have been predicting that growth will slow
this year, early reports indicated the economy entered 1989 with
strong momentum.
   Fed efforts to slow the economy to a more sustainable level of
growth could spell trouble for the Bush administration, which has
pinned its deficit-reduction hopes on optimistic assumptions about
the economy's performance.
   Today's discount rate hike was requested by the boards of the
Fed's regional banks in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond,
Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San
Francisco.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting slack
export demand and increased precipitation in major crop growing
areas.
   A Census Bureau report today of larger-than-expected soybean meal
stocks acted as a further drag on the grain markets and the soybean
complex in particular, despite a continued rise in soybean cash
prices.
   The wheat market has resumed its downward trend after rallying
briefly earlier this week on news that the Soviet Union had
purchased 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Agriculture Department Secretary Clayton Yeutter said today that
the return of wintry weather to the Midwest was encouraging for
spring crop conditions because the snow adds moisture to soil
parched by last summer's drought.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.71{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.06 a bushel; soybeans were \

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with April at
77.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .37 cent lower
with March at 83.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to

bellies were .12 cent to .42 cent lower with March at 39.05 cents a

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures

   The powerful Federal Reserve joined in a spree of bank interest
rate hikes today, raising its key lending fee in a move that
underscored a tougher anti-inflation fight and signaled higher
borrowing costs for millions of Americans.
   The Fed's increase in the discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5
percent was the first such rise since Aug. 9, and coincided with
moves by New York banks to hike their prime lending rate to 11.5
percent from 11 percent.
   The steps jolted Wall Street today and sent stock and bond prices
down sharply. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 28
points to the 2,261 level by late morning. The 30-year Treasury bond
fell nearly $7.50 per $1,000 in face amount.
   The discount rate is the Fed's loan fee to member financial
institutions and historically has influenced other interest rates
nationwide. The increase today put the discount rate at its highest
point in three years.
   The prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business and
consumer loan rates, including car loans and adjustable-rate home
mortgages. An increase in the prime means borrowers will have to pay
more to finance their debts.
   The half-percentage point increase in the prime was first
announced late Thursday by Chase Manhattan bank and quickly followed
by rivals. It was the second increase in two weeks and lifted the
rate to 11.5 percent, the highest level since November 1984.
   The prime hike reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks
face themselves, indicating the Fed is soaking up money in the
banking system, one of its weapons in restraining inflation.
   The interest rate increases came against a background of signs
that inflation is intensifying, a partial result of low unemployment
and strong economic growth. On Wednesday, the Labor Department said
consumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent,
the highest level in two years.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called the inflation trend disturbing
and vowed to pressure rates up until he squeezes inflation out of
the economy.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says No Decisions Yet on Farm Program Cuts</HEAD>

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
today that no final decision has been made on how to reduce federal
spending on farm programs, but he indicated analysts are looking at
many possibilities.
   ``We'll find a way to do so, because that's a requirement of the
(budget) process,'' Yeutter told reporters. ``Agriculture will have
to play its part in that process.''
   He added: ``We'll look every where, obviously ... it'll have to
be done on the basis of economic analysis. We're not going to do it
in an arbitrary or capricious way, and that means analyzing all the
options and combinations of options.''
   Yeutter said he is scheduled to appear before Congress several
times next week but would not have all the budget work done before
then.
   Budget analysts have estimated that up to $2 billion may have to
be whittled from USDA programs in the fiscal year that begins Oct.
1. Those cuts were not specified in the budget proposals submitted
by the outgoing Reagan administration in January and were left open
to be negotiated with Congress.
   Yeutter was asked if $2 billion would be enough to cut farm
programs, mainly the price support operations for major commodities.
He replied that in the long run he would like to see less reliance
on the ``largesse and generosity'' of the federal government.
   ``In the long term I hope we can bring down the budget, but only
if we have similar reaction from our trading partners around the
world,'' Yeutter said. ``We do not want to individually disarm.''
   Yeutter served for 3{ years as U.S. trade representative in the
Reagan administration before President Bush tapped him to be
secretary of agriculture.
   No aides to Yeutter at the Agriculture Department have yet been
announced by the White House, and key jobs are still being carried
out by holdovers from the Reagan administration.
   However, Yeutter said at a news conference that he was hopeful an
announcement would be made soon on the No. 2 post of deputy
secretary, probably ``within the next few days.''
   Reports circulated last week that Yeutter and some presidential
aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job, with
Yeutter opting in favor of Jack Parnell, the California state
agricultural commissioner, or Sam Hollis, a cotton warehouseman from
Memphis, Tenn.
   But there were claims that White House pressure had developed for
former Kentucky governor Louie Nunn, who told The Associated Press
that he had been interviewed by Yeutter several weeks earlier.
   Yeutter said the reports of him bickering with the White House
were ``completely false'' and that there had been no disagreement
whatsoever with the White House.

   The stock market took a tumble today, faced with
a barrage of interest-rate increases.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 31.78 to 2,257.68
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 227 up, 1,129 down
and 450 unchanged.
   After the close on Thursday, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York
kicked off the second round of prime rate increases this month,
raising the benchmark rate on variable loans from 11 percent to 11.5
percent.
   As more banks joined in that move today, the Federal Reserve
increased its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private
financial institutions, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent.
   The Fed said it acted in response to ``inflationary pressures in
the economy.''
   Open-market interest rates on securities such as bonds and
Treasury bills also climbed today.
   While the rise in rates increased investors' worries about the
business and economic outlook, analysts said, they did not come as
any great surprise, given recent government reports that suggested
inflation was heating up.
   Emhart led the active list, up 7[ at 39~. An investment group
known as Topper L.P. said it began a $35-a-share tender offer for
Emhart's stock, and speculation immediately arose among traders that
a higher bid might be in the offing.

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.88 to 162.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.18 at 321.05.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 87.36 million shares at noontime,
up from 75.41 million at the same point Thursday.

   Varian Associates said it will not fight
the Federal Trade Commission's decision to block the $65.8 million
sale of its vacuum products division to the BOC Group of Britain.
   The company said on Thursday that it had been notified by the FTC
that the agency would not approve the planned sale and had
authorized its staff to seek a preliminary court injunction against
the deal.
   The FTC said the combination of the Varian division with BOC's
Edwards High Vacuum business would control too large a share of the
market for a specific leak-detection device.
   Varian President Norman Pond said the matter would not be pursued.
   ``This continues to be a viable and valuable business, and Varian
is formulating plans to streamline and strengthen its competitive
position,'' he said.
   Varian's vacuum-products division, based in Lexington, Mass., has
730 employees and accounts for about 6 percent of the company's $1.1
billion in sales. It produces vacuum pumps and hardware used in a
variety of manufacturing and other processes.
   Varian Associates produces systems and components for
communications, defense, scientific, medical and industrial markets.

<HEAD>Swiss-based Company Named In Largest U.S. Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities Friday linked a
Swiss-based currency trading company to a large-scale drug money
laundering scandal in the United States.
   The American embassy said a probe has revealed that
Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading A.G. of Zurich may be
connected to what was described as the United States' largest drug
money laundering investigation.
   An embassy statement said the probe in New York has revealed that
a Shakarchi bank account in that city may have been involved in
transactions with targets of the probe.
   The company is headed by Mohammed Shakarchi, a Lebanese. Its vice
president, Hans W. Kopp, resigned last October. His wife, Swiss
Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp, quit last month after admitting she
tipped him off that the company may come under investigation.
   The company already had been mentioned in connection with a probe
launched by a Swiss prosecutor into the origins of more than $2
billion allegedly transferred to Switzerland by two Lebanese
brothers, Jean and Barkev Magharian. Both men are being held in
Lugano, in southern Switzerland, on suspcision of fraud. Shakarchi,
a business contact of the Magharians, has denied any part in
laundering drug money.
   A Swiss prosecutor's report this month said Shakarchi told
investigators he warned a manager of Credit Suisse, the country's
third largest commercial bank, that funds deposited by the
Magharians with the bank were of suspicious origin.
   Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova said Friday
authorities were examining whether judicial proceedings can be
opened against the Shakarchi company. He said the company's New York
account contained $500,000 investigators believe is drug money.
   Money laundering is not punishable in Switzerland unless the
funds are used for criminal purposes. Legislation to make it a
criminal offense is being drafted.

   AFL-CIO leaders closed their annual
meeting today confident that organized labor can present a united
front against Eastern Airlines if its mechanics go on strike next
week.
   The Eastern dispute dominated the federation's Executive Council
session this week, and the union leaders as their last major event
went to nearby Miami on Thursday for a noisy rally with the
Machinists outside the airline's headquarters.
   Federation President Lane Kirkland said organized labor would do
``everything possible within the law'' to ground Eastern, sister
carrier Continental Airlines and their parent company, Texas Air
Corp., in the event of a strike.
   The meeting ended after a closing council session today devoted
mostly to internal housekeeping and passage of a few final
resolutions on issues of concern to labor.
   Among those were calls for Congress to pass provisions
restricting private employers from using assets from overfunded
pension plans to initiate or fight takeover attempts.
   The council also condemned the Treasury Department for overruling
a Customs Department classification of imported multi-purpose
vehicles, such as small four-wheel drive vehicles, as light trucks,
which subjected them to a 25 percent tariff.
   ``The Treasury Department has capitulated to foreign political
pressure, pointlessly increasing the U.S. trade deficit and
undermining the jobs of U.S. workers,'' the council said.
   The labor leaders also vowed to be a force in the 1991 national
redistricting that will reshape congressional districts.
   ``It is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a
long-term reapportionment strategy that will assist state
legislative candidates who are committed to programs that benefit
working Americans,'' the resolution said.
   There has been rampant discussion this week about whether labor
could mount a successful boycott of Eastern if there is a strike.
The rally Thursday left the labor officials in an upbeat mood about
those prospects.
   ``This kind of speaks for itself, doesn't it?'' federation
President Lane Kirkland said as he marched in front of Eastern's
complex at the Miami airport.
   Fueling the confidence was the presence of several Eastern pilots
and representatives of their union, whose support would be vital to
any labor hopes of grounding Eastern during a strike.
   Despite the show of solidarity and militant strike talk, the
labor leaders said it was still their hope President Bush would put
off the strike deadline for 60 days by naming an emergency board to
mediate the dispute.
   Kirkland called on the president to intervene ``for the sake of
the future of the airline, for the sake of the communities Eastern
serves, for the sake of the country.''
   The 8,500 machinists and ground personnel, members of the
International Association of Machinists, are scheduled to strike at
12:01 a.m. March 4 unless a settlement is reached during mediation
now under way in Washington, something IAM leaders consider all but
impossible.
   Among the Eastern pilots' union officials at the rally was
Secretary-Treasurer Rick Chapman, who irritated several AFL-CIO
leaders by saying Wednesday the pilots would cross Machinist picket
lines if Eastern management ``makes it worth our while.''
   ``We support the membership of the IAM,'' said Chapman, who
apologized for any trouble his statement had caused and said it was
reported out of context.
   The pilots, according to union policy, will not decide whether to
honor Machinist picket lines until there is a strike. But one, Bob
Breslin, said the ``momentum is growing very rapidly'' to side with
the Machinists.
   Airline pilots traditionally have spoiled labor's hopes of
crippling airlines during strikes by crossing picket lines.
   Eastern management, which has said it plans to operate in the
event of a strike, made its presence felt as well.
   A sign hanging from a company building read: ``Welcome AFL-CIO
delegates. Eastern, your official airline.'' During the rally a
small plane flew overhead toting a banner reading, ``Eastern,
official airline of the AFL-CIO.''
   Most of the federation officials here traveled on Eastern, which
offered a group discount. Federation officials have acknowledged the
irony in that but said they encourage people to fly Eastern because
they want the financially strapped airline to survive.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices on the London Stock Exchange held on
to small gains Friday despite a sharp drop prompted by steep early
declines on Wall Street on the back of an increase in the U.S.
discount rate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day
2.9 points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 2,019.5, just 0.3 point above
its lowest level. The index had gained as much as 14.9 points by
early afternoon.
   Volume came to 568 million shares compared with 551.7 million
shares.
   Countering the negative trend, London stocks got some support
from a bit of fresh buying interest at the start of a new two-week
trading account in the afternoon, dealers said.
   ``We've ended the account on a reasonably good note considering
Wall Street was down 32 points,'' when the London market closed, a
dealer said.
   New York share prices sank after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
increased the discount rate by half a percentage point to 7 percent.
That rate is what the Fed charges on loans to member banks.
   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and
three-week periods for accounting purposes.

   The dollar finished marginally higher in Europe on
Friday as the market reacted without enthusiasm to a hike in the
U.S. discount rate.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's
move to raise the discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent
initially caused the dollar to steam to a session high of 1.8330
West German marks.
   Although dealers had been complaining about the lack of strong
action from the Fed for months, some thought the rate hike was not
strong enough.
   ``It would have been a full point, many people thought, and the
dollar then went down,'' said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   Others said the move came too late and had only a symbolic effect
that wore off. The dollar then traded in quiet ranges.
   Selected late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday: 1.8270
West German marks, up from 1.8215; 1.5602 Swiss francs, up from
1.5535; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2125; 2.0630 Dutch guilders,
up from 2.0590; 1,350.00 Italian lire, up from 1,344.50; 1.1990
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958.
   In London, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. One
pound was trading at $1.7520, cheaper for buyers than $1.7595 late
Thursday.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 126.53 Japanese yen, up from
126.29 yen in Tokyo at Thursday's close.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $390.20 a troy
ounce, down from $391.50 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $389.00 dollars, down from
$391.75 bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $390.68.
   Silver bullion was unchanged in London at a bid price of $6.04
dollars a troy ounce, the same bid as late Thursday.

<HEAD>Racketeering Claim In Continental Airlines Suit to Go to Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The courts will review a $1 billion
racketeering fraud claim lodged by Continental Airlines, accusing
rival carriers of overcharging travel agents who used the companies'
computers to make reservations, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie on Feb. 17 refused to dismiss
the civil claim brought by Houston-based Continental against rivals
American Airlines and United Airlines. Nearly a dozen other airlines
also were involved in the action.
   Rafeedie also denied motions for summary judgment filed by
American and United. The Continental lawsuit charges the two
airlines with violating the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   At issue is the price the two airlines charged travel agents for
use of the companies' computer reservation systems. The plaintiffs
are seeking $1 billion in reimbursement of such fees paid from 1981
to 1987.
   American Airlines attorney J. Edd Stepp said the racketeering
allegations stem from the fact that rates appeared higher if travel
agents called up flights on the airlines' computers.
   ``Since everybody knew it was that way, and the airlines knew, to
us it seems incongruous to suggest that what existed was fraudulent
or misleading to anybody,'' Stepp said. ``We don't believe there is
a shred of evidence.''
   That system, which was phased out in 1984, had been investigated
by the Justice Department, which took no action, Stepp said.

   The government said Friday it will seek
to renegotiate its $2.2 billion foreign debt.
   Treasury Minister Enzo Debernardi said servicing the debt now
amounts to $300 million while the country's central bank has only
$160 million in reserves.
   The provisional government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez won't impose
a unilateral moratorium, Debernardi said, but cannot fully comply
with what is owed.
   The government has been in power since Feb. 3, when Rodriguez
toppled Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a coup.
   Stroessner usually made good on Paraguay's debt payments, but
economists and foreign observers predicted last year that the
country's faltering economy would create problems in 1989.
   A report by the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion made public last
December said Brazil is Paraguay's major creditor nation and is owed
$400 million. Paraguay also owes the World Bank $410 million and the
Interamerican Development Bank $450 million, according to the report.

   The mayor of West Point, Ga., sent a letter Friday
congratulating William Farley on his takeover of West
Point-Pepperell Inc., but many local residents aren't quite as
enthusiastic about the textile giant's new owner.
   ``A year from now, I want to hear how these people like working
for a damn Yankee,'' one angry caller to West Point radio phone-in
program said Thursday, after Pepperell agreed to the buyout. ``I was
born into West Point Manufacturing Co. (a predecessor of Pepperell),
and I sure wanted to die a West Point-Pepperell.''
   But many residents of West Point, where Pepperell for years has
been the main employer, appeared ready to work for Farley even
though Pepperell bitterly had opposed his hostile buyout offers for
months before capitulating.
   Buttons and bumper stickers proclaiming ``Stop Farley'' were on
view Friday, one day after the takeover was announced, with an
altered, handwritten message: ``We Love Farley,'' said Terrell
Whaley, general manager of West Point radio station WCJM-AM.
   ``We have no choice,'' Whaley said. ``He's the man in power now.''
   Pepperell employs about 8,000 people in the area of West Point,
in western Georgia near the Alabama state line. Many were concerned
about their future upon hearing that Farley, chairman of
Chicago-based Farley Inc., had succeeded in his four-month hostile
takeover fight.
   The Pepperell board of directors on Thursday approved Farley's
$58-per-share buyout offer, which will total about $3 billion when
combined with refinancing of Pepperell debt.
   Farley has promised no production layoffs and praised the
Pepperell employees for working hard during the recent months of
uncertainty. But he also has indicated some portions of the company
may be sold.
   ``I just hope they don't shut the mills down,'' Vernon Anderson,
a 20-year Pepperell employee from LaGrange, Ga., told the Valley
Times of nearby Lanett, Ala. ``That's the way these people are
living.''
   West Point Mayor H.E. Steele Jr. said in a telephone interview
Friday that he believes fears of mass layoffs are unfounded.
   ``I never felt it was inevitable that Farley would have mass
layoffs,'' the mayor said. ``He wasn't buying West Point-Pepperell
to go out of business.''
   Steele also said he welcomed Farley's presence in West Point.
   ``I feel it is the end of a tradition but the beginning of a new
era,'' he said. ``I sent a letter of congratulations this morning on
behalf of the city and myself personally.''
   Other holdings of Farley, one of the nation's largest
privately-held conglomerates, include Fruit of the Loom Inc., the
nation's No. 1 underwear manufacturer; Acme Boot Co., which sell
Dingo and Acme boots; and Doehler-Jarvis, which makes die-cast metal
products for the automotive industry.
   Whaley, who spent Friday morning talking to people around town,
said many in the area aren't buying Farley's promises just yet.
   ``I have a lot of apprehension,'' Whaley said in a telephone
interview. ``I wonder if Mr. Farley is sincere when he says he won't
sell off. His immediate plan was to, and now he's twice as much in
debt.''
   But Whaley said most local residents are ``willing to go the
second mile to help him (Farley) make it a success.''
   Whaley said several local residents were disappointed that
Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. failed to stop Farley and
that he did not offer more of an explanation once the decision was
made to accept Farley's bid.
   Farley said Lanier, whose family was associated with the company
for four generations, and President Donald Keller will leave
Pepperell once the merger is complete.
   ``Pepperell is the lifeblood of this community,'' Whaley said.
``Over 8,000 people here work for them. They've been a steady oak
for 103 years.
   ``We've leaned on them _ too much,'' he said. ``And now we've
come to the crossroads.''

   A barrage of interest-rate increases sent stock
prices into a sharp decline today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 35.53 to 2,253.93
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 301 up, 1,204 down and 418
unchanged.
   After the close on Thursday, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York
kicked off the second round of prime rate increases this month,
raising the benchmark rate on variable loans from 11 percent to 11.5
percent.
   As more banks joined in that move today, the Federal Reserve
increased its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private
financial institutions, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent.
   The Fed said it acted in response to ``inflationary pressures in
the economy.''
   Open-market interest rates on securities such as bonds and
Treasury bills also climbed today.
   While the rise in rates increased investors' worries about the
business and economic outlook, analysts said, they did not come as
any great surprise, given recent government reports that suggested
inflation was heating up.
   Emhart led the active list, up 7] at 40[. An investment group
known as Topper L.P. said it began a $35-a-share tender offer for
Emhart's stock, and speculation immediately arose among traders that
a higher bid might be in the offing.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down 1| at
85[; International Business Machines, down 1| at 121}; General
Electric, down | at 45{, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down |
at 29~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.09 to 162.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.85 at 321.38.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.65 million shares with an

   Wheat futures prices closed substantially higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to bullish chart
signals and rumors of impending export sales.
   Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in light
trading.
   The rally in the wheat market capped four straight days of gains
and may indicate that the market expects export sales to pick up
next week.
   Among the rumors was one that the Agriculture Deparment plans to
extend an offer of more subsidized wheat to China. But analysts
tended to discount those expectations.
   ``The same rumor has been around for weeks,'' said Ted Mao, a
grain specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Speculative buying accelerated after prices for delivery of
new-crop wheat topped the week's previous highs.
   Soybeans for March delivery rose more than 6 cents a bushel on
technical signals but other grain and soybean futures were little
changed.
   At the close, wheat was 5 cents to 6} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.33} a bushel; corn was } cent

<HEAD>Colombia Freezes Oil Exports to Help OPEC Price Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia will temporarily freeze oil
exports to cooperate with OPEC's and independent producers' efforts
to stabilize world oil prices, Energy and Mines minister Oscar Mejia
Vallejo said Friday.
   ``Our decision is rather symbolic since we are not in a position
to increase significantly our export levels which, in turn,
represent only an insignificant portion of the world market,'' he
told reporters.
   Colombia is the second non-OPEC country to announce a change in
exports since Tuesday's meeting of independent producers in London.
Mexico said earlier it would reduce exports by up to 5 percent.
   In a statement released after the London meeting, the group said
several nations had agreed either to cut or to freeze exports in the
second quarter to cooperate with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' efforts to reduce output and increase world oil
prices. The group also said details of the agreement would be
released later. Analysts speculated the cuts would total about
200,000 barrels a day.
   OPEC established a new six-month quota that took effect Jan. 1
under which it was to cut production to 18.5 million barrels, about
4 million barrels less than it was producing at the end of 1988.
Although the cartel is said to be producing more than 19 million
barrels, prices have risen about $5 a barrel since the quota was
announced last November.
   Colombia, whose oil industry has experienced problems including
guerrilla attacks on its pipelines, has made it clear that it was
not in the position to reduce exports.
   Colombia exports 180,000 barrels out of a total 435,000 barrels
produced daily. The South American country said it is working to
expand domestic oil pipelines and increase its production capacity
to 600,000 barrels per day next year.
   Among those represented at the London meeting in addition to
Colombia were: Alaska, Canada, the Soviet Union, Mexico, China,
Oman, Egypt, Malaysia, North Yemen and Norway.

<HEAD>Fed's Tighter Credit Means Higher Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers and businesses will pay more for a wide
range of borrowing, from car loans to mortgages, because of the
Federal Reserve's intensified war on inflation, economists said
Friday.
   The Fed is ratcheting up rates because its slow-but-steady steps
to tighten credit so far have failed to prevent inflation from
taking hold, experts say.
   The central bank's interest-rate steering wheel has gotten looser
in recent years. So, like someone at the wheel of a carnival arcade
driving game, the Fed may now have to oversteer to get the results
it wants _ and hope it doesn't cause a crash.
   Indeed, rooting out inflation now that it has become established
will take measures so tough that there is a chance they
unintentionally could produce a recession, economists say.
   ``In the entire last year the Fed acted with so much discretion
that it was almost painful to see. Now people know that they mean
business,'' said Francis Schott, chief economist for Equitable Life
Assurance Society in New York.
   Schott said there was about a 50-50 chance of a Fed-instigated
recession, although most other economists have said a downturn this
year is unlikely.
   On Friday, the Federal Reserve signaled its long-term commitment
to a stepped-up inflation fight by raising its discount rate on
loans to member banks by half a percentage point to 7 percent, its
highest level since April 1986.
   Major banks, which have been squeezed by Fed pressure on other
short-term interest rates, already had begun raising their prime
lending rate half a percentage point to 11.5 percent.
   The hike in the bank rate _ which now is at its highest since
November 1984 _ will boost costs of some adjustable-rate mortgages,
home-equity loans, auto dealer inventory loans and other forms of
borrowing tied to the prime.
   The Fed's squeeze on credit will drive up lending rates across
the board. Auto loans already have gotten more expensive _ they
range from 11 percent to 13.5 percent nationally, excluding special
incentive rates from automakers _ because of the rising cost of
funds for loan issuers.
   Any further Fed tightening could push auto loans still higher,
said John Andrews, a spokesman for General Motors Acceptance Corp.
   Fixed-rate mortgages probably are least affected by the Fed
tightening, but they too have risen about 1 percentage point over
the past year.
   The national average on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans is
likely to rise another three-quarters of a percentage point in
coming months, to the 11.25 percent to 11.75 percent range, before
trending downward as the Fed gets a grip on inflation, predicted
John Tuccillo, economist for the National Association of Realtors.
   Unfortunately for borrowers, painfully high interest rates are
the only tool the Fed has to control inflation.
   If the increases aren't painful, economists say, people and
businesses will continue to borrow freely, the economy will grow too
quickly and shortages of labor and materials will drive prices
higher.
   In January, strong economic growth produced annual consumer price
inflation of 7.2 percent, the highest in two years, the Labor
Department reported Wednesday.
   The Fed's influence on interest rates is less effective in
controlling the economy than it used to be partly because it has
less impact on the housing market. Dampening the housing market
tends to ripple through the rest of the economy, from lumber
suppliers to appliance makers.
   Former federal limits on interest rates made it uneconomical for
banks and savings institutions to make mortgage loans when their
cost of funds got too high. With those caps now gone, mortgage funds
are always available and customers are willing to pay higher rates.
   ``'87 and '88 were terrific for home sales'' in spite of
gradually rising rates, said the Realtors' Tuccillo.
   Oddly, in the past year, the Fed's very success in establishing
its credibility as an inflation fighter undermined its ability to
fight inflation.
   Investors were so confident of the Fed's ability to whip
inflation that they aggressively bought long-term government and
corporate bonds, which are sensitive to inflation. That strong
demand held down long-term interest rates and helped fuel economic
growth _ not what the Fed wanted.
   Now long-term rates are beginning to rise, which should cool off
the economy. One reason is that the Fed finally has raised
short-term rates so high that investors are switching to short-term
investments from long-term bonds, said Barry Bosworth, a Brookings
Institution economist.
   Investors also are backing away from long-term bonds due to the
loss of some confidence in the Fed's ability to quickly curb
inflation. Yields on the bonds are consequently rising, raising
long-term borrowing costs, and the Fed's objectives are being
accomplished through the Fed's failure.
   ``This is the kind of Machiavellian thinking one has to go
through,'' Schott said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has increased a breach of
contract fine against K mart Corp., the nation's second-largest
retailer, to more than $78 million.
   Attorneys for the Troy, Mich.-based retailer asked U.S. District
Judge Ronald R. Lagueux to reduce a $73.3 million award granted last
month when a jury found K mart in breach of contract with a
now-defunct Pawtucket clothing buyer.
   Instead, Lagueux denied the motion Thursday and ruled that 12
percent interest on the basic damages of $59.3 million could be
calculated over 19 more months than originally included, increasing
the award by about $5 million.
   He also upheld a magistrate's order that K mart must pay $80,870
for refusing to supply some pretrial information to the plantiff,
Fashion House.
   Fashion House charged that K mart ignored an 1983 agreement
requiring the retailer to purchase 85 percent of its name brand and
designer clothes from the wholesaler. K mart maintained Fashion
House was not supplying the styles, sizes and colors it ordered.
   After a 56-day trial, Fashion House won a $73.3 million verdict,
including interest. The jury found K mart, a $28-billion-a-year
retailer, had terminated the contract in 1986 without just cause.

<TEXT>
   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire said
Friday it will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to
settle a securities-fraud lawsuit.
   The suit against the company and top executives was brought more
than a year ago by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that
helped pay for completion of the idle Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   D. Pierre Cameron Jr., chief counsel for Public Service, said
less than $1 million in cash would be paid to two New York
securities firms that filed the suit. He said the company's
liability insurance and executive indemnification rights would cover
the payments.
   The case was set for trial next month in federal court in New
York City before the settlement was announced Thursday.
   The settlement must be approved by the federal judge handling the
case in New York and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing Public
Service's bankruptcy reorganization.
   ``The company and the officers and directors have denied and
continue to deny any wrongdoing, but they have entered into the
settlement to avoid further inconvenience, disruption, delay,
expense and the uncertainty of further litigation,'' Public Service
said in a statement.
   The lawsuit was filed by Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg and Elliott
Associates L.P. about a month before Public Service sought
bankruptcy protection in January 1988.
   It centered on the utility's June 1986 suspension of warrants for
purchasing Public Service common stock. The warrants were due to
expire in October 1991.
   The firms charged that Public Service tried to mislead investors
and stall attempts to seek relief by failing to give adequate notice
it had suspended the warrants.
   In a statement Thursday, Public Service said the settlement would
include a new bond-for-stock exchange.
   Public Service suspended the warrants as its finances worsened
because of licensing delays for Seabrook, utility spokesman Nicholas
Ashooh said. Public Service owns 36 percent of the project, which
was completed in July 1986 but remains unlicensed because of
emergency-planning and financial problems.
   Public Service issued more than 18 million of the warrants along
with $425 million in 17{ percent debentures in December 1984. The
financing, a utility industry record, let Public Service pull back
from the brink of bankruptcy and finish Seabrook.
   Warrant holders were able to exchange each one for a share of
common stock by paying $5 cash or turning in debentures with a $5
face value. The warrants are traded on the Pacific Stock Exchange,
the debentures and common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The New York firms said they were unaware the warrants had been
suspended when they bought the warrants and debentures in 1987. The
firms alleged Public Service failed to disclose the suspension in
1987 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   If the settlement wins approval, warrant holders could exchange
lots of 200 warrants and $1,000 worth of debentures for lots of 200
shares of common stock, the utility said.

   Employees in Du Pont Co.'s fibers department
will receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 salaries next
week in the first fruit of an experimental pay plan, an executive
said Friday.
   When the plan takes full effect next year, a portion of
employees' pay raises will be tied to the department's
profitability. The Wilmington, Del.-based chemical giant has touted
the plan as a way to increase profitability by giving employees a
stake in the business.
   The 20,000-employee fibers department makes products such as
nylon, Dacron, Lycra, Orlon, Kevlar and Antron.
   Next week's bonuses are considered an incentive because the
program is not fully in operation and no portion of employees'
salaries was actually at risk.
   Next year if the department performs poorly they could lose the
entire amount they put at risk.
   ``We announced to employees in early February that our
performance in 1988 was such that we would have a 3 percent payout.
Checks will be distributed Monday and Tuesday,'' said Robert McNutt,
who led the team that developed the plan.
   If the department meets 80 percent of its 1989 earnings goal,
employees will receive half of their pay that was at risk. If the
goal is met, employees will receive all of the ``at risk'' money.
Employees could receive three times the amount at risk if earnings
goals are exceeded by 50 percent.
   For 1988, the department overshot its goal for after-tax
operating income of $626 million by about 12.5 percent, resulting in
the 3 percent payout, according to McNutt.
   The bonuses are ``an incentive for the people participating in
the program. It's a way of saying thanks for the job that we did
together as a team in 1988 and so it's a bonus as we move toward
variable pay for 1989,'' McNutt said.
   It is expected to take three to five years to fully phase in the
plan until the employee has a maximum amount of money at risk equal
to 6 percent of what their pay would have been if they had received
all scheduled raises.
   Employees who do not receive a raise this year will not have pay
at risk and thus will not be eligible for bonuses.
   During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive at
least 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers business
performance.
   McNutt noted, however, that late last year about 10,000 employees
voluntarily put 2 percent of salary ``at risk'' for this year.
   The plan was mandatory for all department employees except
unionized workers. About 2,000 production workers at the Spruance
plant in Richmond, Va., voted against the plan, McNutt said, while
the others voted to be in. The department has about 6,000 to 7,000
union workers at plants in Delaware, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Du Pont said if the plan works, it could become a model for the
whole company.

   Stock prices suffered a sharp setback Friday at
the hands of rising interest rates, closing out the market's worst
week in more than six months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 43.92 points to
2,245.54, extending its loss for the week to 79.28 points.
   That ranked as the average's biggest weekly decline since it fell
81.61 last Aug. 8-12.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
327 up, 1,191 down and 443 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.68 million
shares, up from 150.37 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 194.05 million shares.
   After the close on Thursday, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York
kicked off the second round of prime rate increases this month,
raising the benchmark rate on variable loans from 11 percent to 11.5
percent.
   As many more banks joined in that move Friday, the Federal
Reserve increased its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to
private financial institutions, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. The
Fed said it acted in response to ``inflationary pressures in the
economy.''
   Open-market interest rates on securities such as bonds and
Treasury bills also climbed.
   The rise in rates did not come as a complete surprise, given
recent government reports suggesting that inflation was heating up.
   Nevertheless, it increased investors' worries about the business
and economic outlook, analysts said.
   Emhart led the active list, up 7[ at 39~. An investment group
known as Topper L.P. said it began a $35-a-share tender offer for
Emhart's stock, and speculation immediately arose among traders that
a higher bid might be in the offing.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down 2{ at
84\; International Business Machines, down 2\ at 121[; General
Electric, down ~ at 45\; Eastman Kodak, down 1{ at 46|, and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down } at 29}.
   All 30 of the Dow Jones industrial average's component stocks
posted losses.
   California Energy, traded on the American Stock Exchange, plunged
3~ to 16~. A Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst, in his first report on
the stock, gave it a ``sell'' recommendation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $39.16 billion, or 1.36
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 2.37 to 161.72.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 5.77 to 331.33, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 4.92 at 287.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 3.11 to 399.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 321.49, down 1.74.

   Oil futures prices rose in moderate trading
Friday, led by a rally in the gasoline pits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for March
delivery rose 0.37 cent to close the day at 50.11 cents a gallon
after trading 79 points higher during the session.
   Crude oil for April ended the day up 24 cents at $18.07 a barrel,
breaking through what analysts said was an important resistant point
at $18.
   March heating oil advanced 1.14 cents to settle at 51.73 cents a
gallon.
   Analysts said crude prices got a boost from a short-covering
rally in the oil-products pits, mainly gasoline, with brokers buying
before the March contracts expire on Tuesday.
   Dealers also continued to scramble to lock in fixed-volume deals
before summer, said Jayne Ball, commodity oil broker and analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``People are worried about gasoline supplies and about (higher
octane) regulations even though they don't take effect until May,''
she said.
   Several Northeastern states, pending approval from the
Environmental Protection Agency, will impose the new rules requiring
refiners to make the higher octane gasoline.
   Once the speculations take effect, lower octane gasoline might be
in short supply for states outside of the region, Ball said.

   Emhart Corp.'s stock soared Friday
following an unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover offer from an
investment group that includes oil heir Gordon P. Getty.
   Emhart, a manufacturer of a wide range of consumer and industrial
products, said it would study the offer, which came about a year
after the company's own unsuccessful hostile bid for Stanadyne Inc.
   Emhart Chairman Peter L. Scott advised stockholders not to take
any immediate action on the $35-per-share offer announced by Getty's
group, Topper Acquisition Corp., after the close of stock trading
Thursday.
   Investors reacted enthusiastically to the offer Friday, but
apparently expected Topper to bid higher. Emhart stock rose $7.12{
to $39.87{ a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Emhart stock rose almost $10 in the past month amid takeover
rumors.
   Topper told Scott in a letter it would nominate a slate of
directors for the Emhart annual meeting scheduled for April 27.
Depending upon the board's response to its offer, the group said it
might conduct a proxy contest for control of the board.
   James Paper, who follows Emhart for the investment firm
Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc. in Omaha, Neb., said Topper
would likely increase its bid.
   ``They have the resources to go higher,'' Paper said.
   Paper said Emhart has been undervalued for several months, but
has caught investors' eyes with series of well-planned acquisitions
over the past four years.
   ``They have transformed this company from a machinery company to
a very good multi-industry company,'' he said.
   Among the businesses Emhart acquired recently were GardenAmerica
Corp., a manufacturer of garden watering systems, and Price Pfister
Inc., a maker of faucets and plumbing supplies.
   A year ago, the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co. outbid
Emhart with an $820 million offer for Stanadyne, a maker of plumbing
fixtures, automotive and metal products. Emhart had begun a hostile
$596 million tender offer for Stanadyne after being rebuffed in a
friendly buyout attempt.
   Another Kirkpatrick Pettis analyst, Rob Cerny, said Emhart's
diverse subsidiaries made it ideal for a traditional buy-and-bust-up
takeover strategy.
   Topper, which also includes New York real estate developers
Lawrence Fisher and his brother, Zachary, told Scott it planned to
sell Price Pfister and Emhart's Information and Electronic Systems
division.
   But the group said its objective was to ``acquire, own and
operate Emhart, and to continue to build its manufacturing
businesses over the long term.''
   Topper said it had lined up financing for its offer. The group
said Chemical Bank and two other banks have committed $1.2 billion
and an affiliate of First Boston Corp. said it would provide $1.1
billion in short-term financing.
   Getty, 54, gained his fortune through an inheritance from his
father, Jean Paul Getty, who turned Getty Oil Co. into a worldwide
oil giant.
   The Fisher brothers participated in a 1984 bid for Walt Disney
Co. led by financier Saul P. Steinberg. The bid ended with the
Steinberg-led group selling their shares back to Disney at a premium.
   Emhart earned $126 million during 1988 on sales of $2.76 billion,
up from earnings of $106 million and sales of $2.45 billion in 1987.

   Stock and bond markets were battered Friday after
major commercial banks and the Federal Reserve boosted key lending
rates as the central bank toughened its fight against inflation.
   In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded
43.92 points to close at 2,245.54, its biggest daily drop in three
months.
   The decline came only two days after the market's best-known
indicator lost 42.50 points amid signs that inflation at the
consumer level was accelerating.
   In Friday's broader market, seven stocks fell for every two that
rose among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bond prices fell as much as $5 for every $1,000 in face value,
sending interest rates higher with yields on 30-year bonds climbing
to 9.19 percent from 9.14 percent late Thursday.
   Short-term interest rates finished even higher: one-year Treasury
bills were yielding 9.50 percent late Friday, offering investors a
powerful incentive to dump stocks.
   The dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading.
   Gary Schlossberg, senior economist for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco, said he expects interest rates will move even higher
before the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures,
as the Fed desires.
   ``The Fed will will have to continue to tighten a bit more
aggressively. A modest interest rate increase on the order of one
percentage point should be enough to cool the economy off
sufficiently,'' he said.
   Such a move would increase chances that the economy could fall
into a recession, another worry for stock investors trying to divine
the outlook for corporate profits.
   But, Schlossberg said, he believes ``the economy has enough
inherent strength'' that there is a better than even chance a
recession will avoided.
   Before the stock market opened Friday, the Federal Reserve
boosted its discount rate, its charge on loans to member banks, by a
half percentage point to a three-year high of 7 percent.
   Boosting the discount rate is the central bank's most dramatic
signal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth,
thus reducing borrowing, wage and price demands.
   Some analysts said the Fed's move was overdue, especially in
light of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's statements that
he found recent inflation ``disturbing'' and that the bank would
continue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it.
   Fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recent
weeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in January
and that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent last month, their
biggest jump in two years.
   Until Friday, the central bank's moves had largely been conducted
behind the scenes, such as the draining of reserves from the banking
system, a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capital
requirements.
   The discount rate hike followed Chase Manhattan Bank's
announcement after the stock market closed on Thursday that it was
boosting its prime lending rate, a benchmark lending charge that
affects rates paid on commercial, home and other consumer loans, to
11{ percent from 11 percent.
   Other major banks matched Chase's increase on Friday. It was the
second half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last two
weeks.
   The Fed last raised the discount rate in August, to 6.5 percent
from 6 percent. The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March
7, 1986, to April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent.

<HEAD>Leaders of Flight Attendants Vote to Support Strike Against Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the union representing flight attendants
at Eastern Airlines voted unanimously Friday to ask members to honor
a strike by Machinists against the company that could begin March 4.
   Officials with the Transport Workers Union Local 553 said they're
confident their 7,000 members will not cross Machinist picket lines.
   In a statement, union president Mary Jane Barry attacked Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., the parent of Miami-based
Eastern.
   ``Frank Lorenzo has the gall to ask flight attendants to cross a
picket line when he is cannibalizing our great airline,'' she said.
   ``He won't promise to stop dismantling Eastern by selling gates,
aircraft and upstreaming money to Continental (Airlines). Yet, he
wants our members to come to work and help him destroy Eastern and
the economies of Eastern cities like Miami.''
   Continental is the other major subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The flight attendants union received formal requests to support a
strike from William Winpisinger, the International Association of
Machinists' international president, and Charles Bryan, leader of
the Machinists at Eastern.
   ``We had no hesitation in supporting our colleagues and fellow
unionists of IAM,'' Ms. Barry said. ``We realize if Lorenzo destroys
the IAM workers' livelihood, we are his next target.''
   An official of the Eastern pilots union said Wednesday the pilots
would cross Machinist picket lines in the event of a strike,
provided Lorenzo guarantees job security for the pilots and meets
their other demands.
   The pilots union official later apologized to Winpisinger and
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland for any trouble his statement had
caused.
   The Machinists represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground personnel at Eastern. The union has threatened to
strike over contract concessions demanded by Texas Air to save money
at the airline, which has lost hundreds of millions of dollars over
the last several years.

<HEAD>Lumber Futures Tumble As Loan Rates Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Lumber futures fell sharply Friday as traders anticipated higher
mortgage rates and a slowdown in home construction after the Federal
Reserve Board increased its main interest rate.
   On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures plunged the permitted
daily limit of 2 cents a pound; livestock futures were mixed; grains
and soybeans were mixed; energy futures rose; and precious metals
retreated.
   Lumber settled $3.40 to $4 lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for delivery in March at $182.80 per
1,000 board-feet.
   The decline followed increases in both the prime lending rate,
which is the benchmark on which banks base their loan rates, and the
discount rate, the interest rate that the Fed charges on loans to
its member banks.
   Most major banks raised their prime rates 0.5 percentage point to
11.5 percent while the Fed upped its discount rate to 7 percent from
6.5 percent. The increases were seen as efforts to fight inflation
by slowing down the economy.
   Bud Merrill, a lumber market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Eugene, Ore., said the higher interest rates could lead to a
substantial weakening of the lumber market, which has been in a
two-year upswing.
   ``I tend to believe we're going to be under pressure at least
until the early part of spring,'' Merrill said.
   Futures prices for frozen pork bellies fell steeply on the
Chicago Merc ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly cold
storage report, which was expected to show record-high supplies of
the unsliced bacon meat in the nation's commercial meat lockers.
   The report, which was released after the close, confirmed those
expectations. It showed 113.4 million pounds of bellies in cold
storage as of Feb. 1, far surpassing both the year-ago figure of 63
million pounds and the previous Feb. 1 record of 90.2 million pounds
set in 1981.
   The report also showed record-high total pork supplies and
suggested that both turkey and ham would be in abundant supply for
Easter.
   Analysts said the massive pork-belly supply could become a major
depressant on the futures market this summer unless retailers
stimulate the movement of bellies out of storage by cutting bacon
prices, which now average about $1.49 a pound.
   ``We need to knock 50 cents off the retail bacon price in a hury
or this market's goose is cooked,'' said Charles Levitt, Shearson's
chief livestock market analyst in Chicago.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .23 cent higher with April
at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .30 cent
lower with March at 83.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with April at 43.52 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with March at 37.42
cents a pound.
   Wheat futures moved substantially higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid bullish chart signals and rumors of impending export
sales. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in
light trading.
   Wheat settled 5 cents to 7 cents higher with March at $4.34 a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.71{
a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.06\
a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 4\ cents higher with March
at $7.61 a bushel.
   Crude oil spurted above $18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on news that Colombia planned to freeze its oil exports to
help boost prices, a move seen as strengthening OPEC's hand.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 24 cents
higher with April at $18.07 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to
1.14 cents higher with March at 51.73 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to .50 cent higher with March at 50.11 cents a
gallon.
   Most precious metals futures prices slipped lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange as the dollar strengthened.
   Gold settled $2 lower to 10 cents higher with April at $392.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1 cent lower with March at $5.925
a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp., stalling for time to consider what
to do next in its quest to buy Texas Eastern Corp., said Friday it
had extended its $2.6 billion offer for the natural gas company.
   Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey said Coastal extended its
$42-a-share offer, which had expired at midnight Thursday, until
March 10.
   ``What this extension does is preserve our options. It gives us
time to review the courses of action that are available to us, which
include raising the offer,'' Bailey said.
   Texas Eastern, which has rejected Coastal's hostile takeover
offer, on Monday accepted a $3.2 billion, $53-a-share, offer to
merge with Panhandle Eastern. All three natural gas companies are
based in Houston.
   Since Coastal launched its tender offer on Jan. 17, Texas Eastern
stock has soared, closing at $52.25 on the New York Stock Exchange,
unchanged from Thursday's close.
   Panhandle Eastern began a cash tender offer Tuesday for up to 80
percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding shares at $53 a
share. Those shares not purchased under the cash offer will be
exchanged for Panhandle Eastern stock at the same $53 a share.
   Panhandle's offer expires March 20.
   If the merger is completed, the combination of Panhandle Eastern
and Texas Eastern would create a 27,000-mile pipeline system and
produce the nation's second-largest pipeline company in total miles,
Panhandle Eastern officials have said.

<HEAD>Pathe Entertainment to Acquire New World in $263 Million Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling film and television producer New
World Entertainment Ltd. said Friday it has agreed to be acquired by
Pathe Entertainment Inc. in a deal worth $138 million.
   New World sold Marvel Comics earlier this year and its most
recent film releases have been box-office duds, including
``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' ``Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'' and
``Telephone.''
   The deal with Pathe, payable in $57.2 million in cash and $80.8
million in non-interest bearing notes, is subject to approval by the
New World board before Tuesday. Each New World shareholder is
expected to receive about $8.20 per share, $3.40 in cash and $4.80
in a note.
   Pathe Entertainment's chairman is Alan Ladd Jr., the former
president of 20th Century Fox Pictures and chairman of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. The company also holds interests in
banking, insurance, real estate and tourism.
   Pathe is owned by Italian businessmen Giancarlo Parretti and
Florio Fiorini, who also hold a controlling interest in the Cannon
Group Inc., a film production and distribution company.
   New World stock rose 75 cents to $5.75 a share on the American
Stock Exchange Friday. The discount below the $8.20-per-share
acquisition price reflected investors' doubts about the value of the
notes.
   New World, which lost $18.5 million in 1987 on revenues of $384.3
million, sold its Marvel Comics unit for $82.5 million.
   The production company posted operating losses of $79.1 million
on revenues of $220.8 million in the first nine months of 1988, and
carries $125 million in debt. New World announced in late January it
was exploring strategic and financial alternatives.
   New World's latest theatrical releases have been greeted by
sluggish box-office revenues. The company stopped reporting grosses
for ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II'' after the film collected just $11.9
million in 45 days of distribution.
   Upcoming New World titles include ``Heathers,'' ``Warlock,''
``The Punisher'' with Dolph Lundgren and ``Brenda Starr'' with
Brooke Shields.
   The company's television division produces the current series
``Tour of Duty,'' ``Murphy's Law,'' ``The Wonder Years'' and ``A
Fine Romance,'' and the soap opera ``Santa Barbara.''

<HEAD>Computer School Owner Admits $25 Million Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former owner of a defunct computer training
school admitted bilking the government out of $25 million in federal
aid for ineligible students through bogus high school diplomas.
   Leonard Hausman, the former vice president part owner of Hausman
Computer School, pleaded guilty at federal court in Manhattan to one
count each of conspiracy and fraud.
   Hausman, 50, of Plainview, admitted to U.S. District Judge Pierre
N. Leval that he and others conspired to obtain federal loans and
grants for students in his school through fake high school diplomas.
   He also admitted fraudulently obtaining the $25 million through
two Department of Education programs between 1983 and 1987.
   The Hausman Computer School, a post secondary training school
with about 800 students, closed in 1987 after losing is
accreditation.
   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly, many of the
students were not high school graduates and thus were not eligible
for federal aid. Under its New York state operating license, the
school could only enroll high school graduates.
   Hausman's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, claimed a number of students,
who otherwise would have been ineligible, graduated from the school
and are now gainfully employed.
   Carnesi said Hausman would pay back the $1.4 million in salary he
received from the school over the five-year period.
   Hausman admitted in his guilty plea that school employees created
bogus high school diplomas for students enrolled at the computer
school in order to obtain federal aid.
   He is the second employee of the school to plead guilty to
criminal charges.
   Maria Faughaner, 49, of Fort Lee, N.J., a former recruitment
director at the school, pleaded guilty last December to conspiracy
and making false claims.
   She faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines when she is sentenced March 30.
   Hausman, who is slated to be sentenced April 27, faces a maximum
15-year, $500,000 penalty.
   Ms. Daly said there were no plans ``at this stage'' to prosecute
any of the students who obtained loan and grant money illegally
because ``It's not clear that the students would have known that
there was a violation of the law.''

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Charged with Using Scrap in Planes, Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida defense contractor was accused
Friday of illegally using scrap alloy instead of new metal to make
military turbine engine parts, a federal prosecutor said.
   Aerodyne Investment Castings Inc. was charged with a single count
of falsely certifying that the parts for aircraft and the M-1 Abrams
tank were new metal, said U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman.
   The firm has agreed to plead guilty, Genzman said, and will be
placed on five years probation and fined $250,000.
   As part of the agreement, Russell K. Baker, Jr., former
president, has resigned from the board of directors.
   Also, the company has fired certain corporate officers and
supervisors identified by the government in a sealed document,
according to the U.S. Attorney.
   The plea agreement will be presented to a federal judge for
formal acceptance. No date for the presentation has been set.
   Prosecutors alleged that Aerodyne submitted false certificates to
the defense department from 1980 through October 1987. The
certifications pertained to whether the parts met contract
specifications, the government said.
   According to prosecutors' allegations:
   _Aerodyne substituted ``scrap'' or re-used alloy in the
production of turbine engine parts in place of the newly-refined, or
virgin, alloy required under the contract with the Army and Air
Force;
   _Aerodyne certified that the parts provided to those agencies met
certain requirements demonstrated by tests performed on virgin alloy
while the parts were made of a mix of scrap and alloy.
   Aerodyne has agreed to pay $25,000 to the Office of the Inspector
General of the U.S. Department of Defense and $25,000 to the FBI as
reimbursement for investigative costs, Genzman said.
   Aerodyne, which employs about 175 people, has been a defense
contractor for the past decade. By agreeing to terms of the plea
agreement the company has taken a step toward rehabilitating itself
as a corporate entity, Genzman said in an announcement.

<HEAD>Eds: To UPDATE with yen-dollar rates, SUBS 13th graf, The dollar...
Picks up 14th graf pvs, Other late...</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar sagged against the West German mark
and had a mixed showing against other currencies Friday despite
boosts in U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices paused their recent advance. Republic National Bank
of New York quoted a bid of $389 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m.
EST, down from Thursday's late bid of $390.70.
   In early U.S. trading, the dollar rose during a temporary flurry
of dollar-buying after the Federal Reserve Board announced it was
raising its discount rate by a half-point to 7 percent.
   The buying subsided after currency dealers decided the rate hike
would have little impact.
   An increase in the key rate, which is the interest the Fed
charges on loans to private banking institutions, was widely
anticipated in light of the decision by the nation's private banks
to raise their prime lending rates.
   On Thursday and Friday, a series of major banks drove up the
rates used as benchmarks for variable loan interest charges to 11.5
percent from 11 percent.
   Also, the dollar was sold due to persistent worries that failure
to solve the U.S. trade and budget deficit problems will cause
lasting economic damage.
   Many dealers decided to buy West German marks on the grounds that
interest rates in that country will probably rise soon because
inflationary pressures have been building up due to robust economic
activity.
   In New York, the dollar finished at 1.81875 marks, down from
1.82175 Thursday.
   ``We are expecting some interest rate increases in Germany as the
government acts to get control of inflation,'' said Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di Sicilia.
   Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. One
pound was trading late in London's day at $1.7520, cheaper for
buyers than $1.7595 on Thursday.
   Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.7530 compared to $1.7605
Thursday.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 126.53 Japanese yen, up from
126.29 yen in Tokyo at Thursday's close. In New York, the dollar
closed at 126.125 yen, down from 126.175 Thursday. Tokyo foreign
exchange markets were closed Friday for a national holiday, because
of Emperor Hirohito's funeral.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's levels, included: 1.55245 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505;
6.194 French francs, down from 6.2160; 1,342.50 Italian lire,
unchanged; and 1.19825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19485.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday: 1.8270 West German marks, up from 1.8215; 1.5602 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2125; 2.0630
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590; 1,350.00 Italian lire, up from
1,344.50; 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958.
   Gold bullion prices were mostly lower after rising recently amid
evidence that inflation has accelerated. Investors frequently turn
to precious metals when inflation erodes the value of other assets.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $390.20 a troy
ounce, down from $391.50 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the late bid
price was $389.00 dollars, down from $391.75 bid late Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $391.10 a troy ounce, 10 cents higher than Thursday's
settlement price.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $390.68.
   Silver bullion prices were little changed. On New York's Comex,
silver for current delivery declined to $5.923 a troy ounce from
$5.931 Thursday.
   Earlier, in London, silver was unchanged at a bid of $6.04
dollars an ounce.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said Friday that the first of two
special dividends to be paid in late June will be made in cash
rather than notes, as previously announced.
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri said the decision to issue the
dividend in cash ``resulted from the expeditious closing of the
Texaco Canada deal along with the rising trend in short-term
interest rates.''
   Texaco completed the sale of its 78 percent share of Texaco
Canada Inc. to Imperial Oil Ltd. for $3.24 billion on Thursday,
Maneri said.
   Texaco announced on Jan. 29 after completing the sale of more
than $7 billion in assets as part of a major restructuring, that it
would pay two special dividends, one of $4 a share in notes and a
second of $3 a share in cash and $1 a share in preferred stock, for
a total of $8 per share, or about $1.95 billion.
   The company also said it plans to buy back $500 million of its
stock by August 1990.
   Maneri said the second dividend will be distributed as announced
with the proposed record date in August.
   Both dividends are subject to shareholder approval at the
company's annual meeting May 9.

<HEAD>Suitor Calls on Polaroid to Extend Stock Buyback Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc., which is
attempting a hostile takeover of Polaroid Corp., demanded Thursday
that the instant-camera company extend the deadline on an offer to
buy back its own stock.
   Shamrock, an investment company controlled by Roy E. Disney,
nephew of the late animator Walt Disney, said the deadline for
shareholders to accept Polaroid's $50-a-share offer for its own
stock should be pushed past the May 9 date of the company's annual
meeting.
   That would give shareholders a chance to assess the meeting's
outcome, said Shamrock, which itself is offering $45 a share for
stock in Cambridge, Mass.,-based Polaroid.
   Polaroid's offer to buy back 16 million shares, or 22 percent of
its stock, is set to expire March 20.
   In a letter to Polaroid released to the media, Shamrock President
Stanley P. Gold said, ``In its present form and given its present
expiration date, this offer is extremely coercive.''
   A call placed to Polaroid's offices after business hours wasn't
answered.
   The buyback, combined with other moves to put stock in friendly
hands, could give Polaroid management and its allies voting control
of up to 39 percent of the company before the meeting, Gold said.
   At the meeting, shareholders will vote on directors for Polaroid,
including a slate nominated by Shamrock.

<TEXT>
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire
and its top executives have settled a securities-fraud lawsuit
brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that helped
pay for completing the troubled Seabrook nuclear power plant, the
utility announced Thursday.
   ``The company and the officers and directors have denied and
continue to deny any wrongdoing, but they have entered into the
settlement to avoid further inconvenience, disruption, delay,
expense and the uncertainty of further litigation,'' the company
said in a statement.
   In part, the settlement would let the plaintiffs exercise
warrants for purchasing Public Service common stock, the company
statement said. The suspension of the warrants in June 1986, five
years before they were due to expire, prompted the lawsuit.
   ``I don't know whether this will give (the plaintiffs) the same
rights they had originally,'' before the warrants were suspended,
company spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said. He also could not say
whether the warrant and bondholders got anything else in the
settlement.
   ``Full details will be filed in Bankruptcy Court in the near
future,'' Ashooh said.
   The settlement is subject to approval by Public Service's federal
bankruptcy judge and the U.S. District Court in the southern
district of New York, where the case was set for trial next month.
   Public Service suspended the warrants as its finances worsened
because of licensing delays for Seabrook, Ashooh said. Public
Service owns 36 percent of the project, which was completed in July
1986 but remains unlicensed because of emergency-planning and
financial problems.
   Two New York firms, Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg and Elliott
Associates, L.P., filed the securities-fraud lawsuit about a month
before Public Service sought bankruptcy protection in January 1988.
Howard Schiffman, a lawyer for Spear, Leeds, said the firm sought to
recover $7 million including punitive damages and lawyers' fees.
   The firms charged that Public Service failed to give adequate
notice that it had suspended the warrants, in an attempt to mislead
investors and stall their attempts to seek relief.
   Public Service issued more than 18 million of the warrants along
with $425 million in 17{ percent debentures in December 1984. The
financing allowed Public Service to pull back from its first trip to
the brink of bankruptcy and to complete Seabrook.
   Holders of the warrants were able to exchange each for one share
of common stock by paying $5 cash or turning in debentures with $5 a
face value.
   The New York firms said in legal briefs that they bought the
warrants and debentures in 1987, unaware that the warrants had been
suspended. The firms alleged that Public Service failed to disclose
the suspension in 1987 filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   If the settlement wins court approval, holders of the warrants
would be able to exchange lots of 200 warrants and $1,000 worth of
debentures for lots of 200 shares of common stock, the utility said
in its statement. Cash exercise of the warrants would be barred.
   Public Service said it could not predict what the securities
would be worth after the company emerges from bankruptcy protection.

<HEAD>Purchase Offer For Troubled Computer Maker Withdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida retail computer chain owner has taken
back his offer to buy the name and major assets of Leading Edge
Hardware Products Inc. of Canton, which is under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   ``I have taken my offer off the table,'' Stewart Fason, owner of
PC Systems of Riviera Beach, Fla., told The Boston Globe in a story
reported Thursday.
   Fason and Leading Edge founder Michael B. Shane had signed an
agreement for Fason to acquire the name and major computer line of
Leading Edge for $921,000, the amount Leading Edge owed Fason.
   Fason also had agreed to assume responsibility for $11 million
owed to Leading Edge dealers who had paid in advance for computers
they did not get.
   Leading Edge sold low-priced IBM-PC clones made in Asia but
stopped shipping computers last month when it was caught in a cash
squeeze.
   An unrelated legal dispute delayed the sale of Leading Edge to
Fason, and a group of dealers moved last week to force the company
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Leading Edge then filed voluntarily for
Chapter 11 protection.
   Steven Gray, a Boston lawyer, was appointed trustee.
   Fason said he wrote to Gray about his plan to buy Leading Edge
and urged him to move quickly to protect Leading Edge's name. Fason
said he told Gray to consider the offer withdrawn unless it was
accepted by 4 p.m. Wednesday.
   Fason said Gray did not call.
   ``Apparently Mr. Gray decided my plan wasn't good enough,'' Fason
said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stockbroker accused of bilking clients and banks
of between $2 million and $5 million and then fleeing the country
was ordered held without bail Friday pending trial.
   Walter F. Curran, a former Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. broker, was
arrested last week re-entering the United States at a remote New
York town after two weeks in Canada.
   In denying bail, U.S. Magistrate Joyce L. Alexander said Curran
fled with two passports, an international driver's license, a plane
ticket to Germany, valuable jewelry and the combination to a safe
that has not been located.
   She also noted he carried $132,000 in cash when he was caught at
the border and may have additional assets hidden abroad.
   ``I do not believe...the court has a reasonable assurance that
you will appear'' to face trial if released on bail, Alexander told
Curran.
   ``Notwithstanding family, notwithstanding friends, you might
leave. You have already done it once, and you might do it again,''
she said.
   Curran, 46, allegedly persuaded clients to invest money in his
personal account rather than through the brokerage firm with the
promise of 20 percent interest. Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Mullin
said Curran converted the money to his own use.
   Mullin said the broker wrote six checks, each for $125,000 to
$500,000, on overdrawn bank accounts. The prosecutor said the
investment and bank frauds involved lossed of between $2 million and
$5 million.
   Curran is charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of
mail fraud. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine. No trial date was set.
   Defense attorney Thomas Troy said Curran was confused and upset
about his financial problems when he left for Canada but was
overcome with remorse and decided to return to the United States to
``face the music.''
   Troy said he would appeal the magistrate's decision.
   He said Curran's family and friends would stake their houses and
other assets as surety for future court appearances, and offered to
have Troy wear an electronic device that would signal authorities if
he moved 150 feet from his home.
   During a two-day bail hearing, FBI Agent Richard J. Egan
testified that Curran drove to Canada on Feb. 1 after leaving a note
to his wife saying he was going to New York on business.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the Federal Reserve's key lending
rate drove bond prices lower and short-term interest rates higher
Friday.
   The Fed's anti-inflation action pushed its discount rate, the
interest it charges on loans to member banks, from 6.5 percent to 7
percent _ its highest level in about three years.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about ]
point, or $3.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price, jumped to 9.18 percent from 9.14
percent late Thursday, the highest level since September.
   Rates on short-term government bonds came under the most pressure.
   ``The short end got pretty well crushed right after the news'' of
the discount-rate hike, said Steven A. Wood, an economist with
BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco.
   ``It was just confirmation that the Fed really means business in
terms of inflation. It confirmed that the Fed has clearly
tightened,'' he said.
   A hike in the discount rate normally drives short-term interest
rates higher as some banks must borrow to meet reserve requirements.
   The discount rate is now at its highest level since April 1986.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell [ point to 3-16 point, intermediate
maturities declined \ point to 9-32 point and long-term issues lost
5-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.15 to 1,118.03.
   In corporate trading, industrials also retreated. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, was down 0.41 at 295.54.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds slipped [ point to 9017-32. The average yield
to maturity edged up to 7.73 percent from 7.72 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.94 percent as the
discount climbed 7 basis points to 8.64 percent. Yields on six-month
bills leaped to 9.21 percent as the discount jumped 7 basis points
to 8.70 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.50 percent as
the discount advanced 4 basis points to 8.77 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 913-16 percent, up from 911-16
percent late Thursday.

   The hole that tore open on a United Airlines 747
on Friday near Hawaii was reminiscent of a near-disaster in the same
area last year and seemed likely to become the latest in a series of
public relations nightmares for Boeing Co.
   Problems with aging aircraft, miswired emergency systems in some
newer planes, production delays on the giant 747-400 and a series of
tragic crashes have focused unusual attention on the world's biggest
maker of commercial jetliners, particularly in the past 60 days.
   ``What you have here is a series of events and the only
correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame. But if
you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,''
said David Jimenez, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the
Boeing subsidiary that has prided itself on high-class workmanship
and a strong safety record in its planes.
   He added, however, that with news reports of problems coming one
after another, ``it does become one large blur to the public.''
   ``It's made for a very intense period of being scrutinized,
sometimes unfairly, and that's a difficult thing to counter because
the incidents are happening...and we don't always have time to
explain ourselves,'' Jimenez said.
   There was no immediate word on the cause of Friday's incident, in
which nine people apparently were sucked from the United Airlines
jet when a 10-by-40-foot vertical hole opened in its fuselage. The
flight had taken off a few minutes earlier for Auckland, New
Zealand, and Sydney, Australia.
   It brought to mind an accident April 28, also over Hawaii. A
flight attendant was killed and 61 people injured when a portion of
the fuselage on a Boeing 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to
the open air at 24,000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot managed to land
the jet although one of the two engines quit.
   In December, an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 with 104 passengers
and six crew aboard was forced to land at Yeager Airport in
Charleston, W.Va., after a 14-inch hole opened in its fuselage at
31,000 feet.
   The first incident led to widespread concern about the safety of
aging jets like the Aloha 737. Tiny cracks were found in nearly half
the aging Boeing 737 jetliners inspected in the months following the
Aloha accident.
   More recently, a series of crashes focused attention on Boeing
jets: the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing of a Pan American 747 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in which nearly 300 people on board and on the
ground died; the January crash of a British Midland Airways 737 in
England, killing 44 people; and the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707
in the Azores, which killed 144 people.
   But airlines have voted with their dollars in expressing their
continuing confidence in Boeing airplanes. All Nippon Airways on
Wednesday ordered 20 new 747-400s in a deal valued at $3.1 billion.
Orders in 1988 topped $30 billion for 636 planes, both record
figures for the industry.
   But Boeing has been plagued by various safety and production
concerns of late:
   _The company confirmed Wednesday that crossed tubes in cargo-hold
fire-extinguisher systems were found in two Air Canada 767s.
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Feb. 1 ordered checks on
the plumbing and wiring of fire-suppressant and monitoring systems
in cargo holds and engines of Boeing planes built since 1981. Over
the past year, a total of 30 such problems have been found by
airlines worldwide.
   The issue arose after the British Midland crash, when
investigators suspected that crossed wires may have led the pilot to
shut down the wrong engine after a warning system indicated an
engine fire. However, crossed wires subsequently were eliminated as
a cause of that crash.
   Boeing has said it is taking steps to find the cause of the
problems and to make changes so they cannot happen in the future.
   _The FAA said earlier this month that it had asked Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. to determine whether inadequately tested
nuts, bolts and rivets made by Voi-Shan Aerospace Products were used
in making aircraft. Voi-Shan, of Chatsworth, Calif., is being
investigated over reports that test documents on the fasteners were
falsified.
   _Some major airlines have expressed anger at Boeing for delays in
its 747-400 program and have said they will seek compensation for
planes they will not receive on time.
   Boeing concedes it was too optimistic in putting together a
timetable on the 747-400 program, but says that after delaying
initial deliveries of the giant plane it is working to put the
program back on track with no loss in quality.
   Boeing also said earlier this month that it had hired a public
relations firm, Hill and Knowlton Inc. The first sign of the PR
firm's influence was when Boeing issued a statement expressing
condolences over the 707 crash in the Azores Feb. 8 _ the first time
Boeing has issued such a statement before the cause of a crash was
officially determined.

   The Air Line Pilots Association on Friday
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a review of Eastern Airlines'
decision last fall to lay off about 4,000 employees and cut back
service.
   The pilots union said its petition ``will have implications for
all Eastern asset transfers,'' including the pending sale of the
airline's Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald Trump for
$365 million in cash.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said the airline would
have no comment on the petition because officials had not seen the
documents.
   The pilots' announcement came amid mounting tension as a March 3
strike deadline against Miami-based Eastern set by its militant
machinists union approaches.
   Intensified talks involving Eastern management, the machinists
and federal mediators, which began Wednesday in Washington, have so
far failed to produce a settlement.
   The National Mediation Board recommended Friday that President
Bush intervene and block the planned strike, according to
administration sources. The agency suggested Bush name a
presidential emergency board to investigate the protracted dispute,
the sources said. If the president accepted the recommendation it
would automatically delay the strike by 60 days.
   Leaders of the union representing flight attendants at Eastern,
meanwhile, voted unanimously Friday to ask members to honor a strike
by the machinists.
   The leadership of the Eastern pilots union has polled its members
on the strike issue.
   In its earlier court arguments against the layoffs and reduced
service, the pilots union had asserted it was not an efficiency
move, but part of a ``continuing pattern of anti-labor tactics
designed to intimidate employees in the midst of ongoing labor
negotiations.''
   Last August, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington issued a
restraining order against the Eastern plan. The airline appealed,
and in late September a three-member appeals court panel overturned
the restraining order.
   The pilots union's request to have the case heard by the full
11-member appeals court was rejected in early January.
