   Horns blared, fireworks lighted the sky and
strangers kissed in the streets Sunday night as fans celebrating the
San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl victory turned the town into an
impromptu open-air party.
   Authorities closed several streets and Highway 480 near the
Embarcadero because of crowds. Police reported numerous arrests,
most for public drunkenness, but did not have exact figures.
   Roman candles rocketed aloft as fans in the largely Hispanic
Mission District erupted into the streets to celebrate the 20-16
last-minute victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.
   ``We stomped them like bugs in a barn,'' said William Bernhard,
21, from his post on a jammed street corner. ``For the last five
minutes, it was like having an electric eel attached to your spine.''
   ``I feel great,'' said Manuel Anaya, 20, of San Francisco as he
jumped up and down on a crowded sidewalk, waving a 6-foot-long 49ers
banner. ``I knew it all the way. I never gave up, I never gave up.''
   A man leaned from an apartment window overlooking Mission Street,
and played a trombone.
   ``We expect the unusual right now,'' said Officer Stephanie
Thorne at the Mission District police station. ``Cars driving by
with their boom boxes, honking their horns. They're going pretty
good out there.''
   Additional officers were on duty for the evening, Thorne said,
although she couldn't say how many.
   At the jammed Mad Hatter sports bar, fans leaped into the air,
roaring, slapping high fives and wagging fingers at the television
screen.
   At Perry's, a bar, host Rob Hunter said the atmosphere has been
``insane'' all day.
   ``They've been going crazy ...,'' Hunter said. ``We knew we were
going to win it.''
   ``You can't walk on the street, you can't get in the door,'' he
said. ``That's what's going on. We had fire trucks, horses and
police blowing their sirens. It was great. Now they're blocking off
the street.''
   At a Redwood City bar-restaurant called Clark's, which is owned
by former 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark, the crowd ``went crazy''
when 49er quarterback Joe Montana was shown on the post-game show
wearing a hat advertising the tavern, said hostess Pameaux Hudson.
   ``We had people on top of people and people on each other's laps,
sitting, standing, leaning,'' she said.
   Elsewhere, the broadcast of the game was interrupted for fans in
at least two parts of the country.
   In Los Angeles, the audio portion of a cable television broadcast
was disrupted for a few seconds with music from ``The Jetsons''
cartoon and an anti-Semitic slur.
   ``First there was music from `The Jetsons' cartoon show. Then
someone said something about Century Cable and `there's too many
(expletive deleted) Jews in this industry,''' said Doug Debber, a
viewer in Santa Monica.
   The interruption occurred about 3:15 p.m. when an audio signal
invaded Century's cable system, affecting viewers in West Los
Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, a company official said.
   ``I'm baffled at how it was done and I'm shocked and outraged at
the statements that were made,'' said Bill Rosendahl, vice president
of Century Southwest Cable Television in Santa Monica.
   In eastern Ohio and the northern panhandle of West Virginia,
viewers of WTOV television missed much of the second quarter.
Technical problems put the station off the air for about 25 minutes,
a station worker said. The station serves a market of 154,000
households.

   Profound changes are at work in the American
Midwest, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and
farming powerhouses. For autos, the Midwest was the place, Detroit
the hub. Chicago and St. Louis also boasted auto plants. Now,
Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city
blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, ``The
Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

   With a college campus and fertile fields,
this patch of mid-America is a place where students learn and
farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing
a new crop _ cars.
   Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, Bloomington,
joined a growing number of smaller Midwest locales with
Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry.
   The increasing Japanese presence in America's midsection _ plants
in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, one planned for Indiana, and
Chrysler-Mitsubishi here _ is creating work and growth in white
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority
big cities.
   ``Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said
Richard Hill, a Michigan State University urban affairs and
sociology professor. ``The reorganization ... is definitely
detrimental to blacks.''
   The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost
thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential
bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as
a steppingstone to a better life.
   ``Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people
from the lower class to the middle class,'' said Joe Wilson, former
head of a United Auto Workers local at a closed Detroit plant.
``What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural
areas?''
   Japanese automakers, who've invested $5 billion in U.S.-based
facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action
programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _
not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the
Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools
of U.S. autoworkers, preferring to train novices.
   Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _
thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from
gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like Detroit _ are becoming
motor capitals.
   ``It's just a different culture,'' said Bloomington Mayor Jesse
Smart. ``This whole city is like a big neighborhood. (And) with
modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's
compatible with agriculture.''
   In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big.
Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not.
   Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent
unemployment rate in October. Detroit, 65 percent minority, had a
10.1 percent jobless level.
   Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial
decline. In the Detroit area, 52 percent of black men in heavy
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984,
according to a study by Michigan State's Hill.
   Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy
manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports.
   Future prospects are even bleaker.
   A 1988 study concluded Japanese ``behavior with regard to site
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their
traditional American employers.''
   The study, by University of Michigan professors Robert Cole and
Donald Deskins, said although they had no concrete evidence, they
believe ``avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in
determining plant sites.
   ``I think it's a factor,'' Deskins said. ``I can't say this is
their intent.''
   The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian
labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three
U.S. automakers.
   In contrast, the study said, Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA)
Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., has a potential black labor pool
of 29 percent and Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., in
Marysville, Ohio, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say
their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
   Honda spokesman Roger Lambert disagreed with the calculations and
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges.
   Honda, however, agreed last March to give $6 million to 377
blacks and women after an EEOC investigation concluded they should
have been hired sooner.
   The EEOC claimed Honda employed discriminatory practices with a
30-mile hiring radius that excluded Columbus, Ohio, which has the
area's largest minority population. Honda, which expanded its hiring
area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing.
   Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities
and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south
from Michigan.
   Toyota is in Georgetown, Ky., near the University of Kentucky;
Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of Illinois State University,
while Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. is near Lafayette, Ind., across
the river from Purdue.
   These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower
taxes, open space and a well-educated work force.
   Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of
its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and
schools, said G. Glenn Gardner, former chairman of Diamond-Star
Motors Corp., the firm formed by Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   ``We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal,
written and reading,'' he said. ``Some of the major larger cities
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of
students.''
   In Tippecanoe County, surrounding Lafayette, one in four people
25 years and older has four years of college, said Mark Davis,
president of Greater Lafayette Progress Inc., a non-profit
development corporation.
   ``What kind of public education system does Detroit have?'' he
asked. ``What kind of technological capability in terms of college
graduates does Detroit have?
   ``There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the
automotive centers,'' he said. ``We small towns, technologically
sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

   They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and
water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax
abatements.
   Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $88.7 million in state incentives
alone, including 630 acres of farm land.
   ``Nobody ever offered us a site in Chicago ... Detroit ... (or)
St. Louis,'' Gardner said.
   Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions
aren't strong.
   ``They're afraid wages will be high,'' said Michael Young,
director of the Center for Japanese Legal Studies at Columbia
University. ``They're afraid unions will create demands that will
make the company unproductive.''
   Mazda is atypical _ it is 25 miles from Detroit and, spokesman
Jim Gill said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese
automaker with UAW affiliation.
   ``If you're going to locate in Michigan,'' Gill said, ``you best
be prepared to deal with the UAW.''
   Mazda, because of its location, also has many former Big Three
employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers.
   But Vladmir Pucik, international business professor at the
University of Michigan, said the Japanese prefer ``a relatively
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way
of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, `At
Ford, we did it differently.''
   Gardner conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces.
   ``We didn't want to have another car plant that (would) have 20
years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. ``We wanted
some green people when it comes to building cars.''
   But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection
was ``utter nonsense'' and any charge ``we selected a town to stay
away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.''
   The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force.
   Bloomington Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they
built here.
   ``When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to
put in long hours,'' he said. ``Here there's a satisfaction in
seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

<HEAD>Gang Member Says Robinson Ordered `Hit' On Barber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago street gang member testified
Saturday that Noah Robinson ordered a ``hit'' to kill a former
employee, but the witness admitted he was promised money and
leniency for cooperating with authorities.
   Robinson, a Chicago businessman and the half-brother of Jesse
Jackson, is accused of hiring the El Rukn gang to kill Leroy
``Hambone'' Barber in Greenville in January 1986. He pleaded
innocent to the murder and conspiracy charges earlier this month.
   Henry Leon Harris Jr., known as ``Toomba'' in the El Rukn gang,
also has been charged with murder in the 1986 slaying. Harris said
he was the brother-in-law of Jeff Fort, the gang leader who is
serving time in a Texas prison on drug charges.
   Testimony has described the El Rukn as a violent organization
that makes millions of dollars from the sale of narcotics,
murder-for-hire, extortion and racketeering.
   Another former gang member, Eugene Hunter, testified Friday that
Robinson was a close friend of Fort and wielded some power in the
organization.
   Robinson and Barber were childhood friends in Greenville and
Barber once worked for Robinson in Chicago.
   Circuit Judge James Moore agreed last week to combine in the same
trial the charges stemming from the Barber shooting and the charge
that Robinson conspired to kill Janice Denise Rosemond, a witness to
the murder, who survived a stabbing attack.
   Harris said he met Robinson in Chicago in 1985, but said he did
not recall the month. ``He (Robinson) told us he needed hit duty.''
   When Solicitor Joe Watson asked if Robinson offered to pay for
the murder, Harris testified that Robinson ``mentioned $10,000.''
   Harris said that as a general in the El Rukn, he relayed the
information to Fort, who told him and several other gang members to
``take care of it.''
   Harris said that during another meeting at Roinson's home, the
defendant gave them $2,000 in expense money to travel to Greenville.
   He said a first attempt to kill Barber failed because several
members of the gang got into an argument over how to execute the
killing. The second trip to Greenville ended in the fatal shooting
of Barber in front of a business owned by Robinson.
   During cross examination from Robinson's attorney, Robert Simone,
Harris admitted that he lived a ``double life'' and that he
sometimes lied.
   Harris also said he was promised as much as $100,000 from federal
authorities for information about Barber and Robinson.
   Simone described Harris as a ``liar who makes deals to save his
own life.''
   ``I'm telling the truth because I decided I was going to take
control of my life,'' Harris maintained. ``Nobody _ not Mr. Robinson
and not Jeff Fort _ tells me what to do.''
   Harris also testified the prosecution said it would not seek the
death penalty against him in return for his cooperation.
   ``Your real interest right here now is delivering up Noah
Robinson on a platter,'' Simone said. ``You know very well that
federal authorities wanted to get Noah Robinson.''
   Robinson has maintained that federal authorities wanted to frame
him to discredit Jackson, while the former Democratic presidential
hopeful said he had no recent contact with his half-brother.

<TEXT>
   Les Boatwright's death won't keep
him from going to the Super Bowl on Sunday. He'll be there in a
small brass urn.
   Boatwright, 75, died of a heart attack Monday, clutching two
Super Bowl tickets as he prepared to place a bet with his bookie,
said Boatwright's widow, Midge.
   His two sons will take the urn carrying the ashes of the San
Jose, Calif., resident to the Big Game between the San Francisco
49ers and the Cincinnati Bengals, Mrs. Boatwright said. ``I told the
boys, `Do it for your daddy,''' she said.
   ``This is going to be so thrilling for Les, because I know he'll
be there in spirit,'' she said. ``It's a shame the Lord took him so
soon. He could have at least waited until after the Super Bowl.''
   National Football League officials will not object to the
family's plans, said Jim Steeg, NFL director of special events.
   Boatwright's 33-year-old son, Todd, flew to south Florida with
his father's ashes early Saturday. His brother Marc, 37, arrived
earlier.
   After the two return to the Bay area, they will organize a
fishing party and scatter the staunch 49ers fan's ashes in San
Francisco Bay, Mrs. Boatwright said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Deaths of Wild Dogs Was Clue To Suspected Libyan Chemical
Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Bryen is cq in 8th graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' assertion that Libya was
building a chemical weapons plant involved luck, old-fashioned
spying, high-technology surveillance and meticulous analysis, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   But it was the deaths of wild dogs in the Libyan desert that
provided the crucial clue that the plant was allegedly intended to
produce chemical warfare weapons, The Los Angeles Times said.
   A toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site last August
apparently killed the dogs, and panicked Libyans breached security
by using international phone lines to call the German firm helping
them build the plant.
   For the U.S. intelligence analysts accumulating bits of
information about the plant, the excited telephone calls sealed the
case they had been building.
   The phone conversation was picked up by sophisticated electronic
intelligence equipment, reportedly revealing the nature of the plant
and the involvement of West German firms.
   Libya has denied the charges, saying the plant will produce
pharmaceuticals.
   Sources have confirmed British-U.S. cooperation in the detection,
but haven't said whether U.S. monitoring stations or well-placed
British listening posts in Cyprus picked up the Libyans' call.
   The discovery was the first time that U.S. monitoring has exposed
construction of a chemical warfare facility, the newspaper said.
   But ``we've got a long way to go before any of us can take
comfort,'' said Stephen D. Bryen, a recently retired deputy
undersecretary for trade security policy at the Pentagon. ``The fact
is that no government is very well-organized to deal with this
problem.''
   The compilation of data included satellite photos of a major
construction project in the middle of nowhere, the curious
involvement of an Arab businessman who used circuitous routes to
ship equipment to Libya, and pictures of an oversized ventilation
system usually associated with micro-toxin production, the Times
said.
   Robert Kupperman, an expert on arms and terrorism at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
biological weapons pose some of the most difficult detection
problems because facilities can be smaller. For example, a batch of
anthrax that could kill millions of people could be concocted in ``a
room the size of a broom closet,'' Kupperman said.

   Convicted murderer Ted Bundy confessed to at
least nine killings while his lawyers maneuvered to block his
execution scheduled for Tuesday, officials from two Western states
said Saturday.
   Bundy confessed to killing at least eight young women in western
Washington state in 1974, investigator Robert Keppel of the
Washington attorney general's office said.
   Bundy also confessed to the 1975 slaying of a 26-year-old Vail,
Colo., ski shop employee whose body was never found, Vail Police
Chief Ken Hughey said.
   Bundy who grew up in Tacoma, Wash., was scared, shaken and
tearful as he responded to questions from investigators, Keppel told
KIRO-TV of Seattle on Saturday night in a telephone interview from
Florida.
   ``The man is trying to save his life,'' Keppel said.
   Bundy, scheduled to die in the electric chair for the
kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach in 1978, has been linked
to as many as 36 killings and disappearances of young women in
Washington, Colorado, Utah and other Western states.
   The 42-year-old law school dropout was visited Saturday by
officials from several Western states, and more interviews were
scheduled for Sunday, said Paul Decker, assistant warden at Florida
State Prison in Starke.
   Bundy's lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution
Saturday. U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp, who in 1987 called
Bundy ``a diabolical genius'' and ``probably the most competent
serial killer in the country at this time,'' denied a request for a
stay Saturday morning.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta denied Bundy's appeal in a telephone conference Saturday
afternoon without addressing any of the legal issues, said court
clerk Matt Davidson.
   As a last resort, attorneys can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,
but the nation's high court already refused to hear a separate Bundy
appeal Tuesday.
   Bundy last week had offered to trade information about other
slayings for a delay in his execution, but Gov. Bob Martinez, who
signed Bundy's fourth death warrant Jan. 17, refused, saying he
would not ``negotiate with a killer.''
   Bundy also has been sentenced to die for the murders of two
Florida State University sorority sisters, but he had not previously
admitted to any slayings.
   Hughey said Bundy acknowledged killing Julie Cunningham, who
disappeared in Vail March 15, 1975.
   ``Detectives believe the confession is indeed valid,'' he said,
noting Bundy's details about the victim, her clothes and the Vail
area have been persuasive.
   The police chief gave this recounting of what Bundy said: He
approached her on crutches asking for help, one of several ruses
attributed to the suspected serial killer. She agreed to carry his
ski boots to his car, where Bundy knocked her unconscious with a
metal bar.
   The woman regained consciousness after 20-30 miles west of
Glenwood Springs, Colo., but he knocked her unconscious again,
strangled her, left her body where she fell and drove to Utah. He
returned four or five weeks later and buried her.
   In Washington state, Bundy confessed to the eight ``Ted''
murders, said Keppel, who had been a police detective working on
those cases in the 1970s. Witnesses had reported seeing a charming
young stranger who called himself ``Ted'' in the area where several
victims disappeared.
   For the parents of one victim, Central Washington University
student Susan Rancourt, the confession helps write the final chapter
to a tragedy.
   ``It's been an open wound for 15 years, and every time we think
it's settling down, something happens,'' said Miss Rancourt's
mother, Vivian Rancourt, of LaConner, Wash. ``There will always be
that loss that we cannot replace, but at least we can put it all
together.''
   Keppel said Bundy admitted to three additional Washington state
killings, but he was ``at a loss'' to say whether Bundy was telling
the truth about those cases, or just trying to buy time. Keppel said
Bundy provided no details of the three additional killings.
   Keppel said Bundy confirmed in addition to the deaths of the
eight victims that some unidentified bones found near the east
Seattle suburb of Issaquah, where two victims were found, were those
of Georgann Hawkins, a University of Washington student who
disappeared from an alley behind her sorority house on June 11, 1974.
   Her remains had never been found, although King County police
considered her a ``Ted'' victim.
   Keppel hopes to talk to Bundy again Sunday, he said.
   John Tanner, a defense attorney before being elected a prosecutor
in the Daytona Beach area in November, told the Orlando Sentinel
late Friday that Bundy called him last Tuesday and said: ``I want to
tell it all, but it will take longer than six days.''
   Tanner, who befriended Bundy and has acted as a spiritual adviser
for two years, told the Sentinel he believes it could take as long
as several months for Bundy to tell detectives everything they want
to know, including where the remains of some victims are.
   ``Bundy had over 10 years to tell what he had to tell, and if he
is now telling all, that's nice, I'm pleased, but his execution
shouldn't be delayed any longer,'' said Attorney General Bob
Butterworth.
   Tanner on Saturday did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press.

<HEAD>Abortion Support Still Splits Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen years after the Supreme Court legalized
abortions, Americans' views remain sharply split on the issue, The
New York Times reported Sunday.
   Polls over the years have found a majority of Americans
consistently support legalized abortion when the woman's health is
endangered, when the pregnancy results from rape or incest, or if
the baby might be born with a birth defect.
   But the support dips below 50 percent when the reason a woman
wants an abortion is that she is unmarried, does not want the baby
or is too poor.
   Although recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans do
not want the landmark Jan. 22, 1973, Supreme Court decision, Roe vs.
Wade, overturned, other polls indicate support for legalized
abortions is dropping.
   Tom W. Smith, director of general social surveys for the National
Opinion Research Center in Chicago, said the differing results stem
from how pollsters phrase questions.
   ``The reason you get different results is that there are 10
percent of the people who are absolutely against abortion, except
maybe to save the mother's life, and 30 percent who are for abortion
on demand, and that leaves 60 percent who swing back and forth
conditionally, depending on what trimester (of pregnancy) and what
circumstances you're talking about,'' he said.
   The Times said other polling experts agree that more people are
more likely to say they favor abortion when the question is framed
in terms of a ``woman's right to choose'' than when the question
talks about ``protecting an unborn child.''

<HEAD>Poll: A Lot Of Blame To Go Around For Homelessness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More people today say they see homeless people in
their communities than did three years ago and they blame everyone
from the federal government to the homeless themselves, according to
a poll published Sunday.
   Most of the 1,533 people interviewed by telephone for The New
York Times-CBS News poll said they wanted the government to do more
and half said they would pay higher taxes to get it done.
   Fifty-one percent of those participating in the nationwide poll
answered yes when asked if they ``personally see homeless people
around your community or on the way to work.'' Three years ago, 36
percent said yes to that question.
   ``A lot of the blame'' for the worsening should be put on the
Reagan administration, according to 24 percent of those surveyed.
   But they also assigned ``a lot'' of blame to alcohol and drug
abuse by the homeless, 50 percent; to mental institutions for
``releasing patients who aren't ready to lead normal lives,'' 44
percent; the homeless themselves as being unwilling to work, 37
percent; and local governments for failing to take care of people in
need, 30 percent.
   Sixty-five percent said they supported more federal spending on
the homeless, and 49 percent of all those polled said they would pay
$100 a year more in federal taxes toward that end.
   The interviews were conducted from Jan. 12 to 15. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   Third people were arrested and a fourth
person surrendered to police Saturday in connection with a predawn
arson fire that killed six people from four generations of a family,
police said.
   A 17-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man were arrested Saturday
within a few blocks of the house that was heavily damaged by fire
early Friday morning. Another 17-year-old boy surrendered to police
Saturday evening, said police spokesman Sgt. Gregory Mills.
   A 32-year-old man was arrested late Saturday evening, police said.
   No charges were immediately filed against the four, who were held
in the Jackson County Jail, police said.
   Survivors of the fire said a feud with a man who allegedly ran a
nearby drug house may have been the motive for the arson.
   The fire was discovered at 2:45 a.m. Friday by a man inside the
house who went to investigate the sound of breaking glass in the
first-floor living room, Mills said. The fire spread quickly up the
stairs to the second floor, where all six victims were found in
their bedrooms.
   Gasoline was used to start the blaze, Mills said. A nearly empty
five-gallon gasoline can was found near the broken window.
   Preliminary reports said the six victims, who represented four
generations of the family, died of smoke inhalation.
   The victims were identified as Trisha Phillips, 19; her baby,
Mark Sanders Jr., 6 months; Jason Addison, 2; Courtney Addison, 2;
Velma Coleman, 76, and Nola Phillips, 59.
   Two other occupants of the 2{-story frame house were
hospitalized. Four other people fled without serious injury.
   ``They lost their lives for nothing, over something that don't
really make no sense,'' said Mark Sanders, the father of the infant.
   Police had staked out the neighborhood Thursday after getting
``numerous complaints about drug activity,'' said Capt. James Nunn.
Several people were arrested on outstanding warrants after they left
a house in the block, he said.

   A proposal to increase the sales tax to
finance a $174 million domed stadium won an easy victory in a
referendum Saturday.
   The countywide vote for the dome was 93,091, or 53 percent, to
82,612, or 47 percent.
   The vote culminated an 18-month battle between city officials,
businessmen and grass roots groups over the referendum, which
proposed to raise the sales tax in Bexar County by a half-cent to a
total 8 percent over the next five years to pay for construction of
the 65,000-seat stadium.
   ``I think we were outspent and outadvertised. We were just
outperformed,'' said a leading opponent of the project, C.A. Stubbs,
president of the Homeowners Taxpayers Association.
   ``We're going to go from here, no cry-baby speeches,'' Stubbs
said. ``We are disappointed, but we will fight another day.''
   About 31 percent of the county's 566,000 registered voters turned
out for the election amid clear skies and warm weather. There are
1.2 million people in the county, which includes San Antonio.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros, who leaves office in May after eight years
as mayor and six as a councilman, led the pro-dome factions that
said the stadium would help the city increase its $1.5 billion
tourism industry by luring bigger conventions and attracting new
hotels.
   The possibility of using the stadium to attract a professional
sport team was discussed, but that was overshadowed by talk of
boosting convention and tourist business.
   ``Today is an affirmation by the people of Bexar County of the
vision of the future that they want for this area and that is the
real victory of what occurred today,'' Cisneros told about 500
supporters who had gathered at a hotel ballroom Saturday night.
   The Rev. Rosendo Urrabazo, a co-chairman of the grass roots
organization Communities Organized for Public Service, was among the
leading opponents of the stadium's financing proposal.
   Cisneros, Urrabazo and others had debated the issue at town
meetings and on television.
   Urrabazo and others said the private sector should take over
financing of the proposal and said any tax increase should be used
for educational programs and basic services.
   ``This stadium is not a vision for the future. It's a step
backwards,'' Urrabazo said.

<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Walesa quotes, Solidarity march.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity on Sunday accepted a Communist
Party offer to hold talks on legalizing the outlawed trade union
movement and said the negotiations should begin ``as soon as
possible.''
   They would be the first formal talks between Solidarity and
authorities since the union was crushed in a December 1981
crackdown. Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the
Soviet bloc, was outlawed a year later.
   Asked if the agreement between the union and authorities
represented a victory, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said: ``I am a
practical man and practice will show how far Poles can go in
agreement.''
   His comments came during an impromptu news conference that was
held after Solidarity's leadership accepted the government offer and
he took a few minutes to address 5,000 people who attended a Mass at
St. Brygida's Church.
   Walesa wore a Solidarity pin on his lapel and a tie clasp given
to him by George Bush when the American visited Poland as vice
president last year.
   The Solidarity leader, who appeared very happy, said the union
could be ready within two months to hold its first nationwide
congress since martial law was declared in December 1981.
   After the Mass, 1,000 people marched from the church chanting,
``Solidarity! Solidarity! Legalize Solidarity!'' Police blocked the
procession after it had gone a few blocks and it disbanded
peacefully.
   In a statement Sunday ending nearly two days of talks of the
union's leadership, Solidarity said it is willing to respect the law
and its original 1980 statute. It called on the government to
respect the conventions of the U.N. International Labor Organization
guaranteeing trade union freedoms.
   The decision to accept the offer for talks was adopted
unanimously with one abstention of the union's National Executive
Commission, which is made up of about 20 regional leaders from
across Poland.
   On Thursday, the ruling Polish United Workers Party announced a
new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization.
   The party offered to legalize Solidarity under terms to be
negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help reform
the economy.
   Solidarity said the government has met its conditions for
beginning talks on legalizing it and on the social and economic
problems facing Poland.
   ``It is necessary to start negotiations as soon as possible. They
should have a realistic and concrete character, and public opinion
should be informed about it fully,'' the commission said.
   ``On our side we express the will to act according to the law and
according to the statute of our union in the spirit of the superior
interests of Poland.''
   Solidarity called for agreement on a reform program to confront
Poland's ``dramatic economic, ecological and material situation.''
   The statement opens the way for formal talks to begin with
authorities at a talks first proposed by the government during a
wave of strikes in August.
   Walesa had demanded that the party make a political decision to
legalize Solidarity before he would join the talks.
   Both sides have said they are ready to talk, and it appeared that
negotiations could begin very quickly, perhaps within the next few
weeks.

   The crash of a minesweeping helicopter off
the Golden Gate that killed eight crewmen was the result of pilot
error, according to a Navy investigation.
   The investigation found that mechanical error was not a factor in
the July 18 accident, despite earlier accidents involving models of
the Sea Dragon MH-53E three-engine helicopter, the San Francisco
Chronicle reported Saturday.
   The models have been involved in five accidents that cost at
least five lives. Three lawsuits stemming from these accidents have
been filed in California against the aircraft's manufacturer,
Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies Corp. in
Connecticut.
   The Navy investigation said salvage operators were able to
recover 95 percent of the helicopter. However, only six of the eight
crewmen were found. All eight died in the crash, which was eight
miles west of San Francisco.

   The USS Muliphen, a cargo ship with 44
years of naval history, was intentionally sunk in 175 feet of water
to add to an artificial reef.
   Former sailors came for the sinking Saturday, but only a salvage
and tug crew were present when the 468-foot ship was sent to the
bottom about four hours earlier than planned because of bad weather.
   The salvage and tug crews were jostled by seven-foot seas and
winds gusting to 25 knots just before the ship rolled slightly
starboard and disppeared about 17 miles southeast of Fort Pierce
Inlet.
   The St. Lucie County Recreation and Parks Department, the Fort
Pierce Sportfishing Club and private donors raised $107,000 for
salvaging and sinking.
   The Muliphen, commissioned in October 1944, joined two tugboats
submerged earlier as part of the August A. Busch Jr. Artificial
Reef, planned as a fish lure and a fishing spot.

<TEXT>
   The document on human rights and security
35 nations approved in Vienna this month has narrowed the gap
between East and West but widened some fissures in their alliances.
   Both superpowers praise the agreement, which promises broader
individual freedoms and provides for new arms talks, as a herald of
future disarmament successes.
   The ultimate success of the 27-month conference that produced the
document, however, has stirred unrest within the blocs led by
Washington and Moscow.
   European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization show
increasing resistance to U.S. views of how disarmament should
proceed on their continent.
   Warsaw Pact allies of the Soviet Union demonstrate markedly
different degrees of commitment to the human rights protections
spelled out in the Vienna accord.
   Whether the internal divisions will develop into disabling rifts
will depend in large part on the superpower leaders.
   President Bush is expected to continue Reagan administration
policies on disarmament, but mounting pressure from Europe could
produce an approach more receptive to the Kremlin.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program has met
resistance at home and in some nations of the Soviet bloc. At the
moment, Gorbachev desperately needs to cut arms spending as a way of
stabilizing the economy and improving the living standard.
   Western allies are aware of the pressure he faces and of the
serious consequences for arms control if Gorbachev's conservative
opponents gain the upper hand.
   U.S. diplomats concede the Vienna conference succeeded primarily
because of the Soviet reforms.
   Earlier this month, the State Department said release of
political prisoners, easing of emigration and more tolerant policies
on free speech and religious practice changed the American position
on the Soviet proposal for a 1991 human rights conference in Moscow.
   Agreement on a final document in Vienna was delayed because
Western nations objected to holding such a meeting in Moscow. The
conference was one of several since 1975, when the United States,
Canada and all European nations except Albania signed the Helsinki
agreements on European security and cooperation.
   The Vienna statement approved Jan. 15 proclaims the right of all
citizens to assemble, speak their minds, travel, emigrate and
monitor compliance of their governments.
   It sets ambitious goals for better trade relations and
environmental protection and mandates new negotiations on reducing
conventional military forces in Europe, to begin March 9 in Vienna.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union, in
Vienna for the closing session, described the agreement as the
result of commitment and compromise.
   He said the Kremlin would disclose the numbers of its soldiers
and armaments in Europe before the new talks begin. Arguments and
secrecy surrounding the relative strength of forces have hamstrung
existing negotiations that began 15 years ago.
   Asked why he was so confident the new forum would avoid the
pitfalls of the old, Shevardnadze said the alliances were under
increasing pressure to improve the international climate.
   ``It's something our peoples want and their governments, if they
are true governments, should express the will of the people,'' he
told reporters.
   In his speech to the conference, Shevardnadze said the Kremlin
would remove some short-range nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe
and asked NATO to negotiate withdrawal of the remaining
European-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles or less.
   All missiles of intermediate range are being withdrawn and
dismantled under an accord signed in Washington in December 1987,
and negotiators report good progress on a pact to cut stockpiles of
long-range weapons.
   Washington has said repeatedly it does not want to give up
short-range nuclear arms until a Soviet advantage in conventional
forces is reduced.
   ``There's not going to be anything left except the short-range,''
a senior U.S. diplomat said. ``If we want to keep the flexible
response doctrine credible, I don't see any way we can negotiate
these in the foreseeable future.''
   That NATO doctrine holds that the West must retain its nuclear
option until the Soviet advantage in troops, tanks, artillery and
other conventional weapons is reduced.
   West Germany and other NATO members, however, have been chafing
under that and other constraints on the pace of disarmament.
   Stephen Ledogar, the U.S. ambassador to the forthcoming talks,
said Washington wants to see a Soviet reduction in conventional
forces first, but added: ``I'm not trying to suggest there is no
difference of opinion within the alliance.''
   Within the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union's planned pullouts are
popular with the masses but worrisome for some leaderships.
   Even more divisive is the question of human rights and the
varying degrees of willingness among the East-bloc allies to emulate
the Gorbachev policies of glasnost and perestroika.

<TEXT>
   As George Bush looks to the Middle East in
the first days of his presidency, he will find Soviet and European
leaders jostling to share the stage in the peace process that once
seemed an American monopoly.
   The United States remains the region's most important outside
power. But it no longer holds the solo role of matchmaker it played
in the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty.
   ``I believe that Europe is making, can make and will make a
considerable contribution ... toward this Middle East peace
settlement,'' Lord Plumb, President of the European Parliament, said
in Jordan this month.
   The Europeans have played a path-finding role that often has
complimented American actions _ as well as channeling them.
   Their contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization helped
both legitimize the organization and prod it toward more moderate
positions that opened the way for a dialogue with Washington.
   European calls for Israeli compromise have underscored quieter
U.S. pressure on the Jewish state.
   Sweden was a crucial mediator late last year to draw the United
States back into contact with the PLO after a 13-year U.S. boycott.
   Spain's embassy in Tunis hosted clandestine meetings to help pave
the way for those talks.
   Its foreign minister, delegated by the 12-nation European
Community, visited Israeli leaders this month and urged them to
respond to PLO peace efforts.
   Soviet officials pressured their leftist allies in the PLO to
accept Israel, renounce terrorism and endorse U.N. peace
resolutions, setting the stage for the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   Both the Soviet Union and China have improved relations with
Israel, partly in expectation of a role in Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   European parliamentarians and ministers have paraded through the
Holy Land on political pilgrimages, lecturing irritated Israeli
leaders on the need to compromise.
   Italian, Spanish, Greek, British, Scandinavian and East European
leaders have met PLO chief Yasser Arafat to encourage the PLO's
shift from the gun to the conference table. France upgraded the PLO
mission in Paris to a ``general delegation'' _ a step short of
diplomatic recognition.
   The barrage of activity led Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to accuse the European Community on Jan.13 of a ``love affair'' with
the PLO.
   He insisted the community ``cannot bring us closer to the PLO.
That depends only on us. They have no right to impose solutions or
to apply economic pressure.''
   America's long boycott of the PLO eventually achieved a key aim.
The organization last month embraced the moderate stands Washington
had demanded to help sow the seeds of a possible peace settlement.
   But the U.S. isolation of the PLO worked both ways.
   Its repeated efforts to find an alternative to the PLO were all
but demolished by the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising, which
evoked a storm of pro-PLO sentiment in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The policy also caused popular hostility to American policy
throughout the Arab world, whose governments unanimously insist the
PLO is central to any settlement.
   Washington was unable to get Shamir to agree on the U.S.-backed
concept of trading occupied Arab land for peace _ the heart of all
major Middle East peace efforts over the past 20 years.
   The United States largely stood by as Israeli troops invaded
Lebanon and bombed Beirut in 1982, then reneged on a promise to
protect Palestinian refugees after the PLO's withdrawal from Lebanon.
   Congress blocked a key arms deal for Jordan, considered the Arab
key to American Middle East peace plans, infuriating King Hussein.
   By 1984, Hussein said the United States had ruled itself out as a
sole peace mediator. Together with Arafat, he embraced a
Soviet-inspired call for the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council to oversee Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   That plan eventually won broad European support as frustrated
Arabs increasingly asked Western Europe to pressure the United
States to influence Israel.
   Europe responded, keeping an eye on its major economic interests
in the region and mindful of the perils of war between increasingly
well-armed rivals on its southern flank.

   Here is a brief review of the political, social and economic
policies of Warsaw Pact countries:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who gained power in March
1985, has pursued policies that enlarged personal freedoms, promoted
economic change, reduced involvement in such regional conflicts as
Afghanistan and took major steps in arms control. His domestic
reforms are endangered by conservatives in high places; ethnic
strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis; and nationalist movements
in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Gorbachev
also faces opposition because living conditions are slow to improve
and conservatives see danger in disarmament.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLAND _ Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's government has agreed to give
workers a greater voice in economic decisions by offering to
legalize Solidarity with some conditions. The concession seems born
of frustration over inability either to stop an economic slide or
inspire Poles to accept price increases and other means of financing
reform.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUNGARY _ The Warsaw Pact pioneer in economic and social change
plans to open the first stock market in a communist country and has
set the stage for a multiparty political system. It has been the
most vocal of Moscow's allies in pressing for international
standards on human rights guarantees and has been tolerant of
protest and unofficial groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EAST GERMANY _ The 16 million Germans ruled by Erich Honecker
have one of the bloc's most industrially productive nations but have
not won the greater freedom championed by Gorbachev and instituted
in Hungary. Restrictions on emigration and travel have been eased
somewhat, but the Berlin Wall remains a symbol of repression and a
point of contention between East and West.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ Although it has the highest living standard of
the seven Warsaw Pact nations, Czechoslovakia takes one of the
hardest lines on dissent and has balked at many of Gorbachev's
political and economic reforms. Police attacks on demonstrators in
Prague this month have emphasized the different attitudes among
Soviet allies on free expression.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA _ The nation Todor Zhivkov has led 34 years is known as
one of the Kremlin's most loyal followers but has been slow to
embrace change. Human rights abuses and police repression are
reported with increasing frequency as those advocating reform
challenge the leadership.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ROMANIA _ Nicolae Ceausescu runs the most repressive nation in
the Soviet bloc and his attempt to rid it of foreign debt also has
left Romania financially strapped. Food and power shortages have
further reduced a poor standard of living. Hesitant attempts at
public disagreement with the ``The Chosen One,'' as Ceausescu is
called, have met harsh response. Romania said it would refuse to
honor any provisions of the Vienna document it considered intrusive.

   Police hurling tear gas grenades
battled thousands of protesters who tried to march through Seoul on
Sunday to demand the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and the
expulsion of U.S. troops.
   Dozens of the estimated 5,000 radicals were injured or detained
when 6,000 riot troopers charged them, but police had no figures on
injuries or arrests.
   The demonstrators chanting ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Down with
Roh Tae-woo!'' were trying to reach the headquarters of the
governing Democratic Justice Party.
   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets
blocked the march and retaliated with tear gas when some protesters
threw firebombs and rocks to try to force their way.
   The riot police charged the protesters, forcing many to flee
downstairs into subway stations where some were trampled or hit by
people leaping from above.
   Police beat and kicked groups of protesters who were surrounded
by the charging security forces. Other protesters hurled scores of
firebombs, and some police were beaten to the ground by radicals
using clubs and fists.
   ``You are the enemies of our people!'' an enraged man yelled at
police.
   Clashes continued for more than an hour along one of Seoul's main
shopping avenues. Hundreds of terrified pedestrians ran to escape
the fighting and clouds of tear gas.
   Demonstrators repeatedly called for removal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.

industrialists was burned during the march. The rally before the
march also demanded an end to controls on labor unions.
   The protest was the first action organized by a new dissident
alliance, the National Coalition for a Democratic Movement, which
was formed Saturday by about 20 dissident, labor and student groups.
   Coalition leaders said it was the largest dissident group ever
formed in South Korea and claimed a membership of 30,000 people.
   Coalition leaders pledged to seek the fall of the Roh government,
charging it is a front for military rule. The coalition also called
for an end to South Korea's powerful industrial conglomerates and to
all foreign influence.
   The coalition claims it will launch a movement of students,
workers and farmers to remove Roh and create a ``society of
equality'' for workers and the poor.
   Lee Bu-young, a leader of the new group, said, ``Since the
organization is based on grass-roots groups, it will be able to
resist any government oppression and struggle for national
development.''
   Formation of a similar dissident alliance in May 1987 was a key
event in sparking major anti-government protests that forced the
authoritarian government of President Chun Doo-hwan to agree to
democratic presidential elections.
   Roh won the election, and his government has introduced broad
democratic reforms. Radicals refuse to accept that there have been
democratic reforms and claim the nation is still ruled by the
military and powerful industrialists.
   The radicals appear to lack substantial public support, but their
violent protests make them a powerful force in domestic politics.
Roh warned last week that radicals were a threat to political
stability and ordered a harsh crackdown.

since August, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   No casualties or other damage was reported in Sunday's temblor,
which measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, said the agency, monitored
in Nicosia. A quake of that size can cause slight damage.
   The epicenter was registered at Garmsar, 62 miles southeast of

   A magazine falsely reported results of a
popularity poll to say that Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz had
the highest score, state radio said.
   The latest edition of the popular independent weekly Reform said
Grosz topped the list of its ``The Year's Reform Man'' survey with
22.9 percent of nearly 5,000 votes received.
   Pal Emoed, a Reform editorial board member, told the radio late
Saturday that ``not even'' 500 votes had arrived in the magazine
office. He told the radio that of those votes, Grosz finished second
to Imre Pozsgay, a minister of state and leading reformer.
   Emoed gave no figures and did not say who was responsible for
publishing the allegedly false results.
   The public admission of error was extremely unusual in a
Communist country, even in Hungary, where the media have become
increasingly open over the past year.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will
visit China on Feb. 11-14 on her first official trip abroad, the
foreign ministry announced Sunday.
   Ms. Bhutto also may attend the funeral of Japanese Emperor
Hirohito on Feb. 24, but her plans are not complete, said a ministry
spokesman.
   The spokesman, who by custom is not identified by name, did not
give an agenda for the China visit but said the prime minister would
meet top leaders.
   Ms. Bhutto had indicated her first official trip would be to
China because of the traditionally warm relations the Asian nations
share.
   Late President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq had planned to visit Beijing
last May but canceled the trip after firing Pakistan's government.
He died in a plane crash three months later.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, became the Moslem world's first female government
leader Dec. 2.
   Earlier this month she went on a pilgrimage to the holy city of
Mecca.
   Although it was described as a private trip, she held talks with
King Fahd and other Saudi officials.

<TEXT>
   The budget director who will help write
President Bush's fiscal 1990 spending plan gave a Senate committee
an early peek at the basic framework last week, along with
acknowledgment that it will not elicit unanimous applause from
Congress.
   ``I would love it if we could do something you wouldn't
criticize,'' Richard Darman told members of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee at his confirmation hearing. ``But I don't think
we'll be able to meet that test.''
   Darman, whose nomination as director of the Office of Management
and Budget could be approved by the Senate this week, spent most of
his five hours before the committee on Thursday fencing with
Democrats eager to find holes in Bush's campaign pledge of no new
taxes.
   But the 45-year-old former investment banker, deputy treasury
secretary and White House aide also gave some indications of what
Bush's revisions to the budget former President Reagan presented on
Jan. 9 will look like.
   And he gave hints as to how the new president will honor his
campaign pledges to support education, research and other
priorities, while grappling with the federal deficit. The
administration says the imbalance would reach $127 billion this year
without savings, well above the $100 billion cap set by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Asked about education spending, Darman responded, ``You'll see a
lot of emphasis on the role the federal government can play in
providing leadership in regard to education.''
   But in the next breath he said there would be only a ``modest
increase'' in federal education spending. He suggested that,
instead, the government could provoke improvements in education by
other, unspecified means.
   He said the budget would provide tax breaks and other incentives
to spur research and development.
   He said that in looking for savings, Bush would not reduce the
giant Social Security program. But he said the growth of spending
for Medicare, which provides medical services for the elderly and
handicapped, would be reined in. He provided no figures.
   Defense, which accounts for more than one-quarter of Reagan's
$1.15 trillion budget, will not receive the boost of 2 percent
growth, above inflation, that Reagan gave it, Darman said. Again, he
offered no specifics.
   He insisted that Bush's flexible freeze plan _ a brew of spending
increases that rises no faster than inflation, along with no tax
increases _ could reduce the deficit and eventually balance the
budget.
   But he left the door open to retain the $13 billion in asset
sales, user fee increases and other revenue raisers that Reagan
inserted into his spending plan. Darman insisted that none of those
items can be considered taxes, a viewpoint Democrats in Congress are
already disputing.
   Darman said the blueprint would be longer than the 12-page
document submitted by President Nixon when he succeeded Lyndon
Johnson in 1969, but would not be as comprehensive as the six-volume
budget Reagan submitted earlier this month.
   Bush's document, Darman said, would specify ``what the particular
programs are he wishes to emphasize.''
   Those yet-to-come details are what Congress and the new
administration will wrestle over for months to come.

<TEXT>
   France has offered to organize a meeting of the
warring Cambodian factions followed by an international peace
conference, the Foreign Ministry announced.
   ``To this end, it has decided to intensify its diplomatic
activity with each of the countries involved'' to encourage their
participation, the ministry said in a statement late Saturday.
   France is ``at the disposal of the Cambodian parties to organize,
in the form which appears appropriate to them, a meeting that might
encourage a true national reconciliation and open the path toward
the holding in 1989 of an international conference,'' it said.
   It said the issue was discussed at a meeting Friday between
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas.
   Sihanouk has met three times in France with Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen and also met in November with Khieu Samphan, a
leader of the Communist Khmer Rouge.
   Representatives of the four factions _ Sihanouk's army; the Khmer
Rouge; a smaller anti-Communist group called the Kampuchean People's
National Liberation Front; and Hun Sen's Vietnamese-backed
government _ are scheduled to meet next month in Indonesia, as they
did last July.
   The three rebel groups are fighting the Communist government
installed after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia 10 years ago
ended the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror.
   Thailand's foreign minister, Siddhi Savetsila, said Sunday in
Brunei that the Soviet Union, the United States and China might be
invited to join in Cambodian peace talks if their participation
would be helpful.

<HEAD>Tabloids Turn On Duchess of York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sarah Ferguson was lauded as a breath of fresh air
in the stuffy world of royal protocol when she married Prince Andrew
2{ years ago, but today the Duchess of York is known in some
quarters as ``Her Royal Idleness.''
   Britain's brassy tabloids also are calling her ``Duchess
Dolittle'' for what they view as her love of holidays and
jet-setting lifestyle.
   A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of Britain's
royal family put Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, at the bottom with
only 30 last year.
   Sarah was next with 55, less than half those performed by her
husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew, as a naval officer, was not
expected to have other commitments and that Sarah gave birth to
their first child in August.
   But a public opinion poll published Sunday in News of the World
indicated 34 percent of Britons surveyed believe the 29-year-old
duchess does not earn the $150,000 she and her husband receive
yearly from the government for royal duties.
   ``Her Royal Idleness,'' the newspaper's headline blared.
``Freeloading Fergie is the most unpopular member of the royal
family,'' its story said.
   The newspaper said Market and Opinion Research International Ltd.
polled 501 adults last week. No margin of error was given.
   News about Queen Elizabeth II and her family sells newspapers in
Britain, and the duchess has suffered her share of barbs since she
first was linked to Andrew more than three years ago.
   At first, the duchess was lauded for her breezy style and
friendly, open manner. But she slowly became a target, mainly for
her healthy appetite, sometimes plump figure and fashion gaffes.
   After an official visit to California last March, even the
serious newspapers said Sarah and Andrew's behavior had been brash
and vulgar, particularly her bold repartee with audiences.
   As the duchess gained weight last summer during the later months
of her pregnancy, the tabloids delighted in publishing unflattering
photographs of her.
   Criticism intensified last fall when she left her newborn baby,
Princess Beatrice, at home with a nanny for six weeks while she went
to Australia on official business and holidays.
   The attacks reached a crescendo last week when Sarah and Andrew
went skiing at Klosters, Switzerland, where Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a
close friend of the royal family, died last year in an avalanche
that narrowly missed Prince Charles, heir to the throne.
   Critics considered the trip an excessive holiday and unseemly
because it came only a year after the tragedy.
   The Daily Mirror, which branded Sarah ``Duchess Dolittle,'' said
she sobbed after daily briefings by aides on the tabloid attacks.
   The duchess flew to London on Friday to attended a memorial
service for the 34 people killed in a triple-train crash in south
London in December. It was one of only six public engagements she
has scheduled until March, according to Buckingham Palace's official
list.
   The Sunday Times of London, which usually does not focus on the
private lives of the royal family, said the duchess was suffering
from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media.
   The chill is largely due to the royal family's failure to attend
a memorial service in Lockerbie, Scotland, for victims of the Dec.
21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103, and the decision to send Prince
Philip to the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito. Many British
veterans still consider Hirohito a war criminal.
   ``Whether the activities of the duchess are an embarrassment and
a disgrace or whether she is merely fulfilling a popular need for a
bete noir in the nation's most popular soap opera is debatable,''
The Sunday Times said.

<TEXT>
   From the Middle East to the homeless on
America's streets, Ronald Reagan left his successor a host of
problems that defied resolution during his own White House years.
   Some problems, particularly the federal budget deficit, are
manifestly worse than they were when Reagan inherited them from
Jimmy Carter during the presidential turnover eight years earlier.
   AIDS was unheard of in 1981, although the deadly sexually
transmitted virus was already spreading through its victims. To
date, it has claimed the lives of more than 46,000 Americans, and no
cure is in sight.
   The national debt was $930 billion when Reagan moved into the
Oval Office. Now, George Bush has inherited a debt that has soared
past $2.6 trillion and is growing at the rate of $155 billion a year.
   The trade deficit has abated from a peak of $170 billion in 1987,
but the United States still imports $11 billion more than it exports
each month.
   The spread of homelessness across urban America and into its
suburbs has been a nagging reminder that the five-plus years of
unbroken economic growth have also left some Americans behind.
   On the health front, 37 million Americans now have no health
insurance, up from 30 million or fewer at the end of the 1970s. Most
are in working class families not poor enough to qualify for
Medicaid, with their breadwinners in low-paying jobs that offer few
fringe benefits like health insurance.
   Health care costs were soaring much faster than the general rate
of inflation when Reagan took office, and they are still hurtling
forward.
   Efforts by the government's Medicare and Medicaid programs as
well as private insurers such as Blue Cross to demand more
efficiency from hospitals and physicians had mixed results.
   The nation pays more than $500 billion for health care, or 11.2
percent of its gross national product _ far more than any other
nation _ but ranks 19th in the world on infant mortality.
   Reagan accelerated a Pentagon buildup that Carter had begun, but
it came to halt midway through his second term, and now Bush is
faced with the task of cutting the military's spending plans by $200
billion or more over the next several years.
   Among the most expensive military plans is Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, which will cost far more than the current
research budget of $4 billion-plus if Bush makes good on his promise
to press ahead with the research and ultimately deploy the
space-based shield against nuclear attack.
   While Bush made political hay during the campaign over Democrat
Michael Dukakis' opposition to both a mobile MX and the Midgetman
missile, he acknowledged after the election that the nation probably
cannot afford both modernized land missiles and that his defense
secretary, John Tower, will have a painful choice to make.
   The problems of the savings and loan industry, which the General
Accounting Office says may cost $112 billion to fix, have landed on
Bush's lap. Even with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's bailouts of
217 sick S&amp;Ls there are still 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls and 150 others
nearing the brink.
   The Energy Department says it will cost up to $128 billion over
the next two decades to clean up nuclear arms plants and research
facilities, a problem which only in recent months has worked its way
into the public consciousness. The only three reactors capable of
producing tritium, a vital ingredient in the nation's nuclear arms
stockpile, have been shut down by safety problems.
   Reagan left office with nine Americans still hostage in Lebanon.
The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 before Christmas, with the loss of
270 lives, dramatized that terrorism remains a scourge on the world
scene.
   Despite a late opening of talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, little progress was made under Reagan toward bringing
the nations in the Middle East together toward a peaceful resolution
of their long, deep-seated hostilities.
   Reagan and his successor, Bush, can point to such positive
developments in the past year as the cease fire in the Iran-Iraq
war, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and a U.S.-engineered
settlement in Angola.
   In Central America, Congress put an end to U.S. support for the
Contras in Nicaragua, and the Sandinista government there no longer
faces sustained attacks from the anti-communist rebels.
   A solution to the problem of staggering Third World debts, much
of it owed by Latin nations to U.S. banks, eluded James Baker III as
Reagan's Treasury secretary. Now, as Bush's secretary of state,
Baker again will be faced with the problem of how to promote
prosperity among the U.S. neighbors to the south.
   Many experts fear that the hemisphere's turn away from
dictatorships and toward democratic institutions will be reversed if
interest on the debts continues to sap the economies of South
America.

   Former Beatle Paul McCartney said Sunday he'll say
``we want peace'' when he appears on a live phone-in program with
Soviet residents this week.
   McCartney has agreed to field questions from the Soviet Union on
the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Russian Service for one hour
Thursday.
   McCartney, 46, said the Beatles were popular in the Soviet Union
in the 1960s, in part for speaking out on peace with hit songs such
as ``Let It Be'' and ``All You Need Is Love.''
   ``People always used to tell us about how Beatles' records and
Levis (blue jeans) were bootlegged and black-marketed in Russia,''
he said in the interview with Press Association, the domestic
British news agency.
   ``It always gave me a lot of hope and made me think that people
and kids worldwide were basically the same.''
   McCartney in November released a new album, ``Back in the
U.S.S.R.,'' on the Soviet label Melodia for exclusive distribution
in the Soviet Union. The album went to the top of Soviet pop music
charts and the initial 50,000 copies sold out within two days.

   ``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``I hope that the media will now

after the calendar stirred controversy.
   In most of the photos, the male students were conservatively
dressed. However, two photos showed them in bathing suits and

   ``Throughout the country, black students are opting for jobs
after graduation _ not for advanced academic work,'' Sayers said in

   The sun will rise again Monday over this
Inupiat Eskimo whaling community. Big deal, you say?
   People living in this northernmost community in the United States

   Eskimos call January ``the month of the new sunshine.'' Kenneth

   Thousands of Oklahomans converged on Penn

incredible bargains.
   Everybody was fighting for a chance to buy a vowel.
   Representatives of the ``Wheel of Fortune'' game show went to the

   Host Pat Sajak and assistant Vanna White were not part of the
recruiting team, but that didn't keep people from pressing up to
doors at 7 a.m. Saturday, two hours before the doors opened, just to

   One man mailed his beard to the fire chief,
but in the end there wasn't a whisker of real protest from the
formerly hirsute Lynn firefighters forced to face the new year
cleanly shaven.

large fire department to overlook beards before,'' said Numberg, who
was once bearded himself and these days contents himself with a
mustache.
   About 30 men out of 245 in the department went under the razor.
   ``Some contemplated going to their doctors to get a note saying
they couldn't shave because their skin was too tender,'' Numberg
said.
   The beard in the mail was sent anonymously. But it was a
tell-tale color that Numberg told the Boston Sunday Herald he thinks
he recognizes.
   ``I sent a message back saying I was having it tested for drugs.''

   Rain and snow wetted drought-stricken northern Italy
on Sunday, but only a few raindrops fell on most of Sardinia,
rainless for 11 months, and Alpine ski resorts still face a
disastrous season.
   Farmers in the northern Po Valley said last week that rice, wheat
and barley harvests would fail if rain did not fall this month.
   Ski resorts in the Piedmont region in the northwest Italian Alps
announced earlier this month they are seeking government
reimbursement for $115 million in lost tourist revenue.
   Pope John Paul II ended his noon prayers to a crowd in St.
Peter's Square by adding: ``Let's greet this rain with gratitude.''
   Meteorologists predicted skies would clear Monday.
   Rain began Saturday night on the southern end of Sardinia. The
rest of the island off central Italy barely got wet, and Sunday
dawned sunny.
   RAI state television reported that congregations prayed for rain
in services Sunday around the island.
   Sardinian reservoirs had a two-month supply of drinking water
left. Cloud seeding to induce rain has been under consideration and
several cities have limited water use.
   The island wants Rome to declare it a natural disaster area and
is seeking $692 million worth of aid.
   Sheep have nibbled bare most of their grazing areas. Agricultural
officials say the artichoke harvest was hurt by the drought and that
tomato and beet crops could be too. Farmers say the drought rivals
the disastrous dry spell on the island in 1812.
   Snow fell in the Valle d'Aosta area for about four hours Sunday
morning, said Giulia Ianacone, of the Alpine ski area's information
office. ``The snow was not heavy and there was little
accumulation,'' she said, speaking by telephone.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that a few lifts on the
valley's slopes were reopened but they appeared likely to close
again because the snowfall was melting rapidly under a strong noon
sun.
   State television reported two inches of snow fell Sunday on
Courmayeur, a popular resort near the French and Swiss borders.
Eastern Alpine areas reported no snow.
   Before Sunday, the last snowfall in the Italian Alps occurred in
early December, when an average of eight inches fell. The snowless
holidays forced some resort owners to reimburse angry skiers who had
paid in advance for vacations.
   Mild temperatures made the use of artificial snow-makers
impractical, and some international cross-country races scheduled
for mid-January were canceled.

<HEAD>Car Company Reports Success Since General Motors Pulled Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pullout by General Motors
Corp. in 1986 has proved to be a windfall for the South African
executives who took over the company, according to survey published
Sunday.
   Delta Motors, the South African-owned firm formed when the U.S.
carmaker left, was rated ``the biggest success story'' among 16
corporations formed in a similar fashion and surveyed by a
Johannesburg newspaper, The Sunday Star.
   Since GM's withdrawal, Delta Motors has expanded its work force
by 600 and returned to profitability following five years of losses
through 1986, according to the survey. Sales have increased from
24,000 units in 1986 to 40,000 in 1988, the survey said.
   Delta's personnel director, George Stegmann, was quoted as saying
employees considered Delta a better employer than GM and had staged
no strikes or work stoppages since the change.
   According to Stegmann, 67 percent of Delta's work force is black
or mixed-race, compared to 62 percent under GM.
   Stegmann said Delta was continuing to invest in social programs
but was aiming these more at its work force than GM did.
   He was quoted as saying GM's social programs were financed
directly from the U.S. headquarters ``irrespective of the business
performance of the local subsidiary, translating into vast amounts
of money being disbursed to external social projects at times when
employees were being retrenched.''
   ``Employers found it difficult to understand why so much was done
for others when their own needs were not addressed,'' Stegmann was
quoted as telling the Star.
   Executives of other companies surveyed by the newspaper also
reported that the effects of disinvestment had been positive.
   Roughly 150 U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa in
the past four years, generally citing economic factors or pressure
from the anti-apartheid movement. In most cases, the operations were
taken over by white South African managers.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's black majority has no voice in
national affairs.

   Two original paintings by Grandma Moses, valued at
$100,000 each, were stolen from a gallery after two men kidnapped
the manager and forced him to unlock the door, police said Sunday.
   Two other original paintings of unknown value were also taken
from the Bloch Gallery.
   The manager, Thomas Waelter, 39, of Medford, was unharmed. He
told police he was kidnapped by two men after a friend dropped him
off in the parking lot of a train station in Medford around 6 p.m.
Saturday.
   Waelter told police the men threw a blanket over him and forced
him in the back of a Sears van. The men drove him to an alley behind
the gallery and then ordered him to go unlock the front door.
   Waelter was tied up with plastic cuffs on his hands and legs
after the men took the paintings and left, police said. Waelter said
he did not recognize the men but they called him by name.

<TEXT>
   Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who
angered Saudi authorities by slipping out of the country, will be
allowed to return and resume his life in exile, an authoritative
Saudi source said Sunday.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said King Fahd
was acting in response to requests by unidentified African leaders.
He refused to say whether Amin had returned or whether a date had
been fixed for that.
   The African leaders reportedly included King Hassan II of
Morocco, who has close ties with the Saudi monarch, and President
Mobuto Sese Seku of Zaire.
   Amin, 61, was ousted from his east African nation in 1979 and was
granted political asylum in Saudi Arabia in 1980.
   He slipped out of the desert kingdom on a forged passport and
surfaced in Kinshasa, the Zairean capital, with one of his sons on
Jan. 13.
   Uganda immediately demanded Amin's extradition to stand trial for
the death of tens of thousands of his political opponents during the
eight years of his tyrannical rule. Newspaper reports alleged Amin
also practiced cannibalism, but these reports have not been
independently verified.
   Following his arrival in Kinshasa, Zaire deported him to Senegal
so that he could catch a flight back to Saudi Arabia.
   But the Senegal authorities sent Amin back to Kinshasa after the
Saudi authorities refused to take him back because of his abuse of
their hospitality.
   An Arab diplomat said the former dictator has long been unpopular
with his Saudi hosts for meddling in African politics and for his
links with personalities opposed to the Ugandan government.
   On Jan. 18, a report from Kinshasa said he had been deported
again and was returning to Saudi Arabia.
   However, there has been no official confirmation of his return,
and Saudi officials have refused to comment on all aspects of the
story.
   People in the Red Sea port of Jiddah said they could not say
whether he had returned to his residence there, a guarded remote
villa outside the city.
   Diplomatic sources said they believe Amin is still in Zaire.
   The Ugandan Embassy in Riyadh has been saying all along that it
does not know where Amin is.

   Two years after burning bodies were found
in a ceramics factory's kilns, members of a prominent family who ran
a mortuary face trial for alleged mass cremations and removal of
organs and gold from corpses.
   The case has conjured up Holocaust-like images of bodies packed
into ovens and produced preliminary testimony that one member of the
family was called ``Hitler'' by his employees and engaged in
strongarm tactics.
   David Sconce, 32, and his parents, Jerry Sconce, 55, and
Laurieanne Lamb Sconce, 52, are accused of 67 counts including
multiple cremation of human remains and unlawful removal of body
parts from human remains.
   They deny the charges.
   Their trial was scheduled to begin Monday but Los Angeles County
Deputy District Attorney Jo Ann Glidden said Friday it is expected
to be postponed because attorneys have other case commitments.
   David Sconce on Friday was ordered to stand trial by himself on
one count of conspiracy to murder the owner of a cremation society
that Sconce once wanted to take over. Ms. Glidden said she will seek
to consolidate the two cases.
   The scandal has already produced a state law allowing crematory
inspection on demand. And lawsuits have been filed against 100
mortuaries that used the Sconces' cremation service on behalf of
families of 17,000 decedents cremated between March 1983 and
December 1986.
   The case involves the Lamb Funeral Home, was founded in 1929 by
Mrs. Sconce's grandfather; Coastal Cremations Inc., of which David
Sconce was president, and Coastal International Eye and Tissue Bank.
   Coastal Cremations charged other mortuaries only $55 per
cremation and sought business widely as the use of cremation boomed
in California.
   On Jan. 20, 1987, authorities in Hesperia responded to complaints
of odors at David Sconce's Oscar Ceramics plant in the desert and
found burning bodies in its furnaces and cans of human ashes.
   The investigation led to shocking testimony.
   Officials alleged the mortuary and tissue bank removed and sold
gold teeth plus brains, bones, corneas and other organs without
consent of next-of-kin; embezzlement of interest from prepaid
funeral trust accounts; illegal cremation of more than one body at a
time, and comingling of ashes.
   It is a felony to dismember human corpses in California and a
misdemeanor for crematoriums to burn bodies together without the
permission of survivors.
   David Edwards, a driver for the crematory from 1983 to December
1985, testified at one hearing that David Sconce paid to have
funeral directors beaten, pried gold teeth from corpses and boasted
of the number of bodies he could burn at one time.
   Edwards said he and two others divided $750 for attacking the
directors, whom David Sconce feared would publish allegations of
multiple cremations in an industry magazine.
   ``He wanted them messed up and hospitalized,'' said the witness,
who has pleaded guilty to assault.
   He said he often saw as many as a dozen bodies in the crematory
retorts, or ovens. ``I looked at it as gore. It was sickening,'' he
said.
   Edwards said David Sconce sometimes spoke about setting records
for stacking bodies. ``It was over 13 and the old records were
continually being broken,'' he said.
   He told of holding a flashlight while David Sconce pulled gold
teeth from the mouths of a dozen corpses, and said he once saw him
smash a corpse's jaw with a crowbar to get at gold teeth.
   The prosecution has not calculated the number of bodies that
allegedly were handled illegally by Lamb.
   ``They were cremating like 8,000 bodies a year,'' she said, and
multiple cremations were conducted on a daily basis.

<HEAD>Arafat Rejects Proposal Of Limited Self-Rule For Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat on Sunday
rejected a proposal for limited self-rule for Palestinians in the
occupied territories and elections to choose peace negotiators.
   ``It isn't worth the trouble to reply to these proposals, which
have been rejected even by Palestinian children,'' Arafat told a
group of reporters. ``It is a new attempt to get out of the
bottleneck in which Israel has found itself.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization chief was in Baghdad for a
meeting of Palestinian leaders involved with the 13-month uprising
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A peace plan proposed last week by Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzak Rabin calls for a period of limited self-rule for
Palestinians in the territories, followed by a three-way
confederation of Israel, Jordan and Palestine.
   Rabin also said if the Palestinians halted the uprising, they
could hold elections to choose peace negotiators.
   Other Palestinian leaders also have rejected the plan, which
Israel says was Rabin's private proposal. Jordan's foreign minister,
Marwan Kassem, also rejected it, Amman's daily Ad Dustour reported
Sunday.
   Kassem was quoted as saying ``Israel is required to withdraw from
the Arab lands they occupied in 1967, then to give the Palestinians
an opportunity to set up their Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank.''
   Earlier Sunday in Nicosia, Cyprus, Arafat called on ``Arab kings,
presidents and princes'' to rally in support of the revolt.
   He said the uprising will continue ``until our people establish
their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital,''
according to a statement issued in Nicosia by the Palestinian news
agency WAFA.
   In Baghdad, Arafat accused Rabin of stepping up repression in the
occupied territories in an attempt to halt the rebellion.
   Arafat spoke surrounded by members of the PLO executive committee
and several Palestinian leaders he said had traveled from the
occupied territories.
   He said he was chairing meetings to discuss ``means of escalating
resistance'' in response to tougher Israeli measures to crack down
on the uprising.
   Last week, Rabin announced a policy that allows troops to fire
plastic bullets more freely at stone-throwers and Palestinians
setting up roadblocks. The rules also call for destroying the homes
of suspected stone-throwers.
   Arafat said he will ask western European nations to play a
greater role in Middle East peace efforts when he meets the foreign
ministers of Spain, France and Greece in Madrid on Friday.
   He also said the PLO is seeking a meeting of the United Nations
Security Council to discuss the situation in the occupied
territories.
   Arab newspapers, meanwhile, reported efforts to arrange a meeting
between Secretary of State James Baker and Arafat, who last month
renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist. The
United States subsequently dropped its 13-year ban on talking with
the PLO.
   Abu Dhabi's state-run daily newspaper Al-Ittihad said Sunday that
Egypt invited Baker to visit the Middle East to pave the way for an
international peace conference on the region.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Cairo, said
Egypt's ``intensive current efforts with Washington are aimed at
arranging a meeting between Arafat and Baker during that tour.''
   The Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Madina quoted unidentified sources
as saying consultations were under way to set up an Arafat-Baker
meeting in Tunis in February.

<HEAD>Thornburgh `Guesses' Court Will Overturn Landmark Abortion Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, speaking on
the 16th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision
legalizing abortion, said Sunday it was his ``guess'' that the court
would reverse itself this year and allow states to outlaw abortion.
   Should that happen, Thornburgh said he would support prosecution
of those involved in illegal abortions, but he was not specific and
did not answer directly when asked whether he would favor
prosecution of women who illegally terminated a pregnancy.
   Sunday was the anniversary of the Jan. 22, 1973, decision in Roe
vs. Wade but many of the annual demonstrations by anti-abortion and
pro-choice groups marking the decision were scheduled for Monday.
   President Bush is scheduled to speak by telephone to a Monday
march organized by the National Right to Life Committee. President
Reagan made several such calls during his administration.
   The Supreme Court last year agreed to review a Missouri case in
which a lower federal court struck down as unconstitutional a
stringent state anti-abortion law. In its appeal, the state urged
reversal of Roe vs. Wade, and the Reagan administration filed a
brief calling the Missouri case an ``appropriate opportunity'' to
reconsider the 1973 decision.
   ``I think what we have to look for is what kind of approach the
court takes if they do overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' Thornburgh said on
the NBC program ``Meet the Press.'' ``My guess is that they will
return the regulation of abortions, like many health and safety
questions, to the states.''
   Thornburgh said he was ``not predicting'' the outcome of the case
and characterized his comments as ``strictly a guess.''
   But he also said the administration was confident it would
prevail in the Missouri case, William L. Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services. Webster is the Missouri state attorney general.
   Asked about possible prosecutions in the event the high court
reversed Roe vs. Wade, Thornburgh said those decisions would have to
be made at the state level. But he added:
   ``I think the key is that there are certain classes of abortion
that would be beyond the class of being legally able to be carried
out and this would call for prosecution.'' He did not answer
directly when asked if he personally favored prosecution of women
who illegally obtained abortions, saying again that such decisions
would be made by states.
   Thornburgh defended the administration's position on abortion
when asked whether Bush had considered polls showing that a majority
of Americans believe a woman should have the right to choose
abortion.
   ``You want to follow public opinion where you can but there are
also matters of principle involved and these are matters that the
president feels strongly about,'' Thornburgh said.
   The Supreme Court most recently reaffirmed Roe Vs. Wade in 1983
but the current court is viewed as deeply divided on the issue. Its
two most junior justices, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy,
both conservatives appointed by Reagan, have not voted in an
abortion decision.

   White House national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft said Sunday it would be ``premature'' to arrange a
high-level Bush administration meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat until Arafat's intentions are more clearly known.
   Scowcroft's comments came amid Arab press reports that spoke of
intensifying Arab efforts to arrange a meeting between Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Secretary of
State-designate James A. Baker III.
   ``We already have established discussions with Chairman Arafat,
and it seems to me we ought to explore and probe what he sees as the
evolution of this,'' Scowcroft said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley.''
   He noted that the United States decided to resume contacts with
the PLO because Arafat came around to the U.S. view on recognizing
Israel's right to exist.
   ``What has happened in our changed policy toward Arafat is not a
new United States initiative,'' Scowcroft said. ``The chairman
could've had that at any time since 1975. Then he decided to do what
he finally did. Now, it seems to me, we find out what it is he has
in mind.''
   Asked specifically about the desirability of a meeting between
Baker and Arafat, Scowcroft said: ``I think it would be premature to
meet at such a high level until we have a better indication of where
Mr. Arafat may be going.''
   Abu Dhabi's state-run daily newspaper Al-Ittihad said Sunday that
Egypt has extended an invitation to Baker to visit the Middle East
to pave the way for an international peace conference.
   Quoting unidentified sources in Cairo, the newspaper said Egypt's
``intensive current efforts with Washington are aimed at arranging a
meeting between Arafat and Baker during that tour.''
   The Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Madina also quoted unnamed sources
as saying consultations were under way to prepare an Arafat-Baker
meeting in Tunis in mid-February.
   The Reagan administration broke a 13-year ban on U.S. talks with
the PLO last month. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the
decision was based on a public statement by Arafat renouncing
terrorism in all forms and accepting Israel's right to exist.
   The State Department revealed last week that a second, more
informal ``contact'' with the PLO had been made in Tunis on Jan. 17.
The department also released a partial transcript of a tape
recording in which Arafat vowed to shoot anyone who tried to stem
Palestinian unrest on the Israeli-held West Bank.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy said last month
that talks with the PLO would be suspended if Arafat reneged on his
renunciation of terrorism.
   On another issue, Scowcroft said suspected poison gas plants in
Libya and Iraq pose a very serious problem, but he declined to say
whether the Bush administration would endorse use of force to knock
them out.
   ``They are a terrible problem. And it is a problem akin in its
scope to that of nuclear proliferation, because these weapons _
especially in city attacks, anti-population attacks _ can be every
bit as devastating as nuclear weapons,'' he said.
   Scowcroft noted that ``they are much harder to control, because
the plants to produce them are in many cases like pharmaceutical
plants, like insecticide plants.''
   He was questioned about whether it would be more serious to use
force against such chemical weapons plants or to let them go into
production.
   ``Sometimes one has to make a choice between undesirable
alternatives,'' Scowcroft replied.
   But he added: ``I'm not about to make that choice now.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Promises `Beefed-Up'' Federal Role In Trading Probes</HEAD>

   The federal government will expand its role in
investigating alleged insider trading and other fraud in the
nation's securities and commodities markets, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said Sunday.
   Thornburgh said the ``beefed-up'' federal role would include new
task forces established specifically to focus on ``fraud and insider
dealing in both the securities and commodities markets.''
   Thornburgh, interviewed on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,''
declined to be specific about a current investigation of the world's
two largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But he indicated authorities were
preparing to submit evidence to a grand jury.
   ``Obviously, I can't discuss in detail what's a pending
investigation,'' Thornburgh said. ``I don't want to, obviously, make
any predictions. But the investigation is far-reaching, it is
significant. ... We will be gathering and submitting evidence to see
if violations of the federal criminal laws have occurred.''
   Asked when such a review might take place, Thornburgh said: ``You
can never put a timetable on that, I'm afraid.''
   The FBI reportedly has been investigating alleged fraud by
traders at the Chicago exchanges for the past two years. The
investigation centers on allegations investors were cheated out of
millions of dollars and reportedly has included the use of wiretaps
to record conversations with traders suspected of fraud.
   While avoiding specifics about the Chicago case, Thornburgh
promised an expanded federal role in such investigations.
   ``We'll be announcing soon a much beefed-up operation in this
regard because it's basically a pro-consumer initiative,''
Thornburgh said. ``People who trade on these markets are entitled to
their integrity.''
   He was not specific about the composition or duties of the
planned task forces or about when the announcement of their
establishment would be made.
   Word of the Chicago investigation surfaced the same week that the
federal prosecutor widely associated with insider-trading
investigations on Wall Street, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani,
announced he was resigning.
   President Bush will appoint a successor. New York Republican Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato has recommended criminal defense attorney Otto
Obermaier, despite objections from Giuliani. Presidents
traditionally accept the recommendation of the senior state senator
from their party.
   Giuliani's objections stem from Obermaier's representation of
several firms that are or have been targets of insider-trading
investigations.
   ``Those are choices that are made by the president and they would
be made only after careful scrutiny of the individual's
qualifications to serve and carry out the president's agenda,''
Thornburgh said when asked whether Bush would accept D'Amato's
recommendation.

   The Communist Party's decision to reverse a
seven-year stand against Solidarity offers the possibility of a
compromise unprecedented in the history of the Communist bloc.
   For the first time, Communist leaders have offered to negotiate
with an independent, popular opposition movement on the structure of
political and social freedoms affecting the entire society.
   Unlike 1980 talks with Solidarity, authorities now openly say
they want to discuss ways to legalize opposition to the government
and to institutionalize a parliamentary opposition that would
transform the party-dominated system.
   The talks would cover trade unions, Solidarity's first goal.
   But the subjects of other independent associations and clubs,
elections, freedom of the press and constitutional changes also are
expected at talks on Poland's future.
   Even the normally skeptical Solidarity leader Lech Walesa seemed
impressed and said he was surprised by the document on trade union
and political freedoms issued after a tumultuous party Central
Committee meeting last week.
   ``It has never happened in the party before. It will mean
breaking the monopoly (on power),'' Walesa said of the document's
strong endorsement of economic, political and social pluralism.
   Solidarity's National Executive Committee on Sunday agreed the
government's expression of willingness to legalize the trade union
federation removed the last obstacle to talks with authorities. A
Solidarity spokesman said the talks should start ``very soon.''
   But much skepticism remains in Solidarity ranks, based on past
experience. The union had a signed agreement with the government in
August 1980 guaranteeing its right to exist. But the accord proved
meaningless when Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski called out
his troops and interned thousands of Solidarity members in a Dec.
13, 1981, crackdown.
   Now there are suspicions the government wants a new accord only
to calm a huge wave of public unrest that appears to be building
after yet another year of steep inflation and constant shortages.
   Polish living standards dropped sharply in the early 1980s and
still have not climbed back to the level of a decade ago.
   Walesa warned in a television debate in November that Poland is
in danger of falling further and further behind the rest of Europe.
   He argues for labor calm because widespread strikes would harm
the economy. At the same time, Walesa stresses that the union must
have the right to strike and says he will not sign any agreement at
the cost of Solidarity's independence.
   A government source demanding anonymity said authorities are
counting on Solidarity to keep the peace and expressed confidence
that if the union and authorities form a partnership, they will keep
factories calm and give planned economic reforms a chance to work.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, said Sunday
the union ``will not be pushed into the role of the police or a fire
brigade'' to put out strikes.
   But he added, ``We want to discuss economic reform. ... If it
works then there will be no need to make a general strike.''
   The dramatic change of course by Polish authorities can be
explained in several ways.
   In addition to the specter of strikes larger than the two waves
of labor unrest that shocked authorities last year, there has been a
growing consensus _encouraged by Poland's powerful Roman Catholic
Church _ that the country will never move forward without compromise
between the government and opposition.
   Some credit must go to Walesa's performance on a nationwide
television debate in November. While coming out strongly for
reinstating Solidarity, he convinced authorities he is a responsible
leader not seeking to plunge Poland into confrontation.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said the government's
polling data after the debate showed a significant increase in
support for both the government and Solidarity.
   This was not paradoxical, he said. Agreement could prove a
popular and beneficial policy for both sides.
   Among rank-and-file Solidarity activists, there is eagerness to
get started again.
   ``Everyone is ready for it,'' said Andrzej Durzynski, a union
member from Solidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.
   ``It won't be necessary to create Solidarity anew, simply to
reactivate it.''

   In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey shocked and
fascinated Americans by telling them what was going on in their own
bedrooms.
   Four decades later, the hot topic at the now world-famous Kinsey
Institute has shifted from the bedroom to the boardroom.
   June Reinisch, the sex research center's high-profile,
column-writing director, has been asked to resign.
   Officials at Indiana University, where the institution is located
and which provides some of its funding, last month called for her to
step down, saying she has managed the institute poorly and failed to
conduct enough research in her 6{ years there.
   Reinisch refuses to step down, calling the charges groundless.
She also maintains that only the institute's 10-member board of
trustees, on which she sits, can tell her to resign. The institution
is incorporated separately from the university, though five of the
board members are university employees.
   ``The institute does not just belong to Indiana University,''
Reinisch said. ``We're a national and international institute. We
belong to the public.''
   Reinisch and the university are stalemated, with the board of
trustees waiting for her to decide whether she will resign. No
deadline was given.
   In the meantime, Reinisch said she is trying to conduct business
as usual at the institute, founded in 1947 by Kinsey, an Indiana
University zoologist who studied the gall wasp before turning his
research to human sexuality.
   There are no signs to let the public know the institute even
exists on the university campus, or that inside its walls are housed
thousands of pieces of erotic art. Its library includes 75,000
volumes and sexually-oriented material including cartoons, stag
films, fetish objects, condoms and prison art.
   Reinisch, 45, continues to write her syndicated column, The
Kinsey Report, which appears in newspapers nationwide and deals with
topics ranging from sexual fantasy to menopause.
   But Reinisch also said she spends a large part of the day on the
telephone discussing her situation with an attorney. She has written
a 100-page-plus rebuttal to a university review committee's critical
report, which led to the call for her resignation.
   Other developments have added to the chaos:
   _Last fall, the institute's three librarians left abruptly during
a renovation of the library. Their departure forced the library to
close; it has not reopened.
   _Following the review committee's report, the institute's former
director, Paul Gebhard, severed ties with it and criticized library
cutbacks made after the library's part-time staff was replaced with
the full-time librarians.
   ``Frankly, it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other
austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on
carpets, drapes, brass lighting fixtures and similar
non-essentials,'' he said.
   Reinisch said the renovation money came from separate funds that
she asked the university to set aside as a condition of her
accepting the $79,000-a-year job, not from research funds. She came
from Rutgers University in New Jersey, where she was a psychology
professor.
   ``You can't have an internationally known center that looks like
an attic,'' she said.
   _A major fund-raiser planned for February in Los Angeles by
Sherry Hackett, a trustee and wife of comedian Buddy Hackett, was
postponed because of the uncertainty over Reinisch's position.
   Exactly why some want to get rid of Reinisch remains unclear,
aside from the complaints about her management style and research
efforts.
   Said Reinisch, ``A lot of the discussions and a lot of the
testimony _ most of it _ and a lot of the letters that the committee
has collected, all in fact, have been done under the promise of
confidentiality.''
   Morton Lowengrub, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and
the official who called for her resignation, has declined to comment.
   A review two years before Reinisch was hired found the institute
``in drastic need of reorganization,'' the Herald-Times of
Bloomington reported. A faculty committee found the institute ``must
come closer to achieving its scholarly objectives'' to warrant
continued university support, and it recommended hiring a new
director.
   Reinisch defends her work, noting that she brought with her more
than $800,000 in research money and obtained a grant for more than
$700,000 three years later. She lists at least 15 publications since
1982 of which she was the primary author.
   Reinisch contends Kinsey, who died in 1956, would be pleased by
her leadership.
   ``I've really thought of him all the time and tried to do the
kinds of things that I thought he would do or that he would like to
have done at this point because, of course, today is not 40 years
ago,'' she said.

   A top Vatican official announced that Pope
John Paul II will retain a rule barring elderly cardinals from
electing new popes, a source said Sunday. The rule has reportedly
caused dissension among cardinals.
   The Vatican source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monsignor Agnelo Rossi, dean of the College of Cardinals, said in a
letter to the cardinals the pope is keeping the rule enacted by his
predecessor, Paul VI.
   The Italian news agency ANSA, in a report on the letter, said
Rossi noted at recent meetings of cardinals that there has been open
criticism about the rule, which bars cardinals 80 years and older
from voting for new popes.
   Other news reports Sunday said Rossi's announcement came in
response to a letter to the pope signed by 10 cardinals asking for a
change in the rule.
   However, several of the 10 cardinals named in the reports denied
signing such a letter. Such a letter would be unusual since it would
be a formal display of dissent at the top of the church hierarchy.
   After the pontiff, cardinals come next in the hierarchy of the
Roman Catholic Church. There are currently 156 cardinals, of whom
119 are under 80.
   In 1970, Pope Paul VI withdrew from cardinals 80 years or older
the right to elect popes and hold Vatican office. He hoped to
rejuvenate the Roman Curia _the central offices of the Catholic
Church _ and the secret conclaves of cardinals that elect the pope
to replace a deceased one.
   The change has been a source of criticism since by some cardinals.
   The Italian news agency Adn Kronos reported Saturday that 10
cardinals had signed a letter asking for a change in the law, and
the Milan daily Corriere della Sera said it had confirmed the report.
   However, ANSA on Sunday said it contacted four of the cardinals
named by the agency and they denied signing any such letter.
   One of the four cited by ANSA, Cardinal Corrado Bafile, told The
Associated Press he had not signed a letter about the age limit. He
said that the reports ``are not true, at least on this point.'' He
would not elaborate.
   Cardinal Silvio Oddi was quoted as saying in Sunday's La
Repubblica newspaper that he didn't sign any such letter because
``no one asked me to. But, sincerely, I would have signed it without
hesitation.''
   He was further quoted as saying: ``If a person is fully lucid and
capable of reason why forbid him from voting?''

<TEXT>
   Soul legend James Brown, who has been
helping with a prison choir while serving a South Carolina prison
term, returns to court Monday to face weapons and assault charges in
Georgia.
   Brown will be tried for 10 misdemeanor charges stemming from two
separate arrests last September in Augusta, Ga.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence in the State Park
Correctional Center for failing to stop for police during a
two-state car chase Sept. 24.
   Buddy Dallas of Thomson, Ga., an attorney for Brown, said the
``Godfather of Soul'' is in good spirits.
   ``I talked to him a few days ago and he feels good,'' Dallas
said. ``He's rearranged the prison choir, and I understand church
attendance is up dramatically.''
   Brown, 55, of Beech Island, has not granted any media interviews
in prison despite numerous requests.
   Seven of the Georgia charges against Brown stem from his arrest
last Sept. 24 by the Richmond County Sheriff's Department.
   Authorities said Brown disrupted an insurance seminar in an
Augusta, Ga., office building by walking in with a shotgun. Before
officers could arrive, Brown left the building and the two-state car
chase began.
   The charges include carrying a deadly weapon to a public
gathering, assault, carrying a pistol without a license, reckless
driving, attempting to flee or elude police, driving with a
suspended license and having no state license tag.
   Brown also will be tried for driving under the influence of
drugs, improper movement and driving with a suspended license. These
charges were filed after his Sept. 25 arrest by Augusta police.
   His wife, Adrienne, 33, also will be tried for three charges
brought after a September 1987 arrest. The charges include driving
under the influence of drugs and speeding.
   Brown also still must appear before a South Carolina judge to see
if he violated terms of a probation handed down in Aiken County last
July. He had been given a 2{-year suspended sentence and fined
$1,200 after pleading guilty to carrying a pistol and resisting
arrest. No court date has been set.

<TEXT>
   Calls for a ban on private ownership of
semiautomatic military weapons in California have risen strikingly
since one was used in Stockton in a schoolyard attack that killed
five children.
   The state attorney general and several lawmakers hope to pass
legislation while Californians are still stunned by the killings and
the wounding of 29 other children and a teacher last week by a man
firing an AK-47 assault rifle.
   ``These kinds of weapons are available to anyone who wants to buy
them,'' said Attorney General John Van de Kamp. ``All one needs is a
warm smile and cold cash. This is madness and this has to stop. We
have to ban these weapons from going in the streets of our city and
state.''
   Senate leader David Roberti urged Californians to ``write, talk,
call on talk radio, call their legislators, demand, scream,
pressure, intimidate'' in favor of a ban.
   At the request of San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, the U.S.
Conference of Mayors may take up a resolution calling for a ban on
paramilitary weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47. Agnos
himself was wounded by a gunman in one of San Francisco's infamous
Zebra attacks 15 years ago.
   The group agreed to have a subcommittee consider the resolution
in February, said Agnos' press secretary, Eileen Maloney. The
resolution would only be advisory in nature.
   ``If urban mayors and police chiefs across the country unite
behind a grass-roots demand that sale of assault weapons be halted,
I am convinced we can make our voices heard in the nation's
statehouses and the halls of Congress,'' Agnos said.
   The efforts are being met with vigorous opposition by staunch
pro-gun advocates such as H.L. Richardson, a national director of
the National Rifle Association and founder of Gun Owners of
California.
   ``The real question is how a nut like that with his background
can be walking around on the street. Why don't we go after the
criminal for a change?'' Richardson said of the Stockton gunman,
drifter Patrick Purdy, who killed himself after the assault on the
schoolyard.
   Purdy had both a criminal record and a history of mental
problems. He bought the AK-47 at a gun shop in Sandy, Ore., in
August. All he had to do was fill out a form and pay for it. No
waiting period was required.
   Purdy could have bought the rifle in California as well. Under
the law, law, anyone 18 years old or older with a driver's license
can purchase a rifle. There is no waiting period and nothing
preventing felons or those with a history of mental problems from
buying rifles.
   Richardson said he owns a semiautomatic weapon. ``I use it for
hunting turkey in Texas,'' he said. ``It is also a very good varmint
firearm. Very accurate.''
   Gov. George Deukmejian, asked if he would support a ban on the
weapons if passed by the Legislature, said he would first ``want to
review the whole issue very carefully.''
   ``But I, just for the life of me, cannot see why anybody who is
going to use a gun just for sporting purposes would want or need to
have a military assault type weapon,'' he added.
   Deukmejian said he would support a requirement that rifle and
shotgun buyers wait 15 days for a background check before obtaining
one of the weapons. The state currently has such a delay on the sale
of handguns.
   ``I don't think that anybody who has got a known record in terms
of criminal activity or somebody who has had mental problems _ I
don't have any problem with preventing those individuals from
getting possession of any gun,'' Deukmejian said.
   The attorney general's proposed legislation will offer a
definition of a semiautomatic assault weapon and specify some
brands, all of which would be banned, said Dick Iglehart, Alameda
County's chief assistant district attorney and a member of a task
force created by Van de Kamp to address the problem.
   But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said he was ``not terribly
optimistic'' that lawmakers will do anything about gun control.
   ``Every day that we move away from the Stockton-type incident,
the legislative will to do something in that area will be reduced,''
Brown said.

<TEXT>
   Officials plan to investigate police actions
during a white supremacist march that drew bricks and bottles from
angry counterdemonstrators, but the city's top policeman believes
there were no major problems.
   The city response to Saturday's march by a handful of Nationalist
Movement followers ``was as good as we could make it,'' said George
Napper, Atlanta's commissioner of public safety.
   But he said some allegations would be looked into, including
reports of officers clubbing and arresting uninvolved spectators
while trying to control the angry crowds.
   ``Obviously, there were some incidents, but I thought by and
large we avoided anything major. This city has a legacy to work
things out. ... I think that's why we haven't had the kind of
situations that took place in Miami,'' he said referring to last
week's riots there.
   Police reported 42 arrests in the confrontation between the
half-dozen white supremacist marchers and the hundreds of
counterdemonstrators. Hospital officials said they treated 13
people, including police officers, members of the Georgia Army
National Guard and counterdemonstrators, for minor injuries.
   Atlanta was quiet Sunday. Parts of the march route were still
littered with bricks, boards, broken bottles, rocks and chunks of
concrete hurled at the marchers and the police and National Guard
members protecting them.
   In all, an estimated 2,000 National Guard members and state and
local police were mobilized in what appeared at first to be a
striking case of overkill.
   But Atlanta, which is heavily black, houses several colleges and
universities and has a sizable counterculture community _ all
potential sources of participants for countering a white supremacist
march.
   Counterdemonstrators and bystanders, estimated at between 1,000
and 3,000, overwhelmed police lines along parts of the route,
charged toward the marchers and hurled objects.
   ``The city invited this kind of thing'' by issuing the white
supremacists a march permit, charged Dianne Mathiowetz, a member of
the Ad Hoc Committee Against the Klan.
   Michele Allen, another counterdemonstrator, said the
rock-throwers ``are just as bad as the Klan. People have to stand up
to the Klan, but there has to be some peaceful way. This is a war
zone.''
   Mississippi lawyer Richard Barrett, who heads the Nationalist
Movement, and his handful of followers sang and shouted anti-Martin
Luther King slogans along the route of about two miles.
   Barrett attempted the march on the eve of last July's Democratic
National Convention, but the city canceled his permit when hundreds
of counterdemonstrators massed at the Capitol and police feared
violence.
   He said Saturday's march was a restaging of the earlier effort as
well as a repudiation of King, whom he called a tyrant and a sexual
pervert, and of the national holiday honoring the slain civil rights
leader.
   Barrett declined to say if he would try to march again in
Atlanta. ``I have just begun to fight,'' he said.
   After the march, Napper went to Five Points, Atlanta's central
downtown intersection, where at least 1,000 mostly black youths
remained assembled, watched by scores of police on horseback or in
riot control gear.
   Napper, who like most of Atlanta's top law enforcement officials
is black, was pelted with questions and insults asking why Barrett's
group was allowed to march and was given protection.
   ``You protect the Klan but you won't protect us. You ain't my
commissioner,'' one woman screamed. ``You're protecting people who
will lynch my grandchildren,'' yelled another.
   Napper, who broke out of the crowd with police help, said: ``They
are entitled to protection. It's not always easy.''

<TEXT>
   A meeting of more than 900 people Sunday nominated
Andrei D. Sakharov for a seat on the new Congress of People's
Deputies representing Moscow, an activist said.
   The nomination puts the human rights activist, physicist and
Nobel Peace Prize winner on an electoral collision course with
former Moscow Communist Party leader Boris Yeltsin and a powerful
Politburo member.
   It also gives him two nominations in the upcoming elections _ one
as a candidate representing Moscow's Oktyabr district, which was
made last week, and one as a candidate for the entire capital.
   Sunday's nomination came at a meeting organized by the Memorial
group, said Yuri Mityunov. Memorial is a group formed in memory of
victims of dictator Josef Stalin.
   Mityunov, a participant in the meeting at the House of Filmmakers
on Moscow's north side, said a member of Moscow's Election
Commission informed the meeting three other candidates so far had
been nominated for the same seat.
   They include Yeltsin, the still-popular former Moscow party boss
who was sacked by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in November 1987
because of his management style; and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, the
president of the Russian republic and a full member of the Communist
Party Politburo.
   About 500 people pressed outside the Filmmakers' building, unable
to get into the 3{-hour meeting that was hastily organized by
Memorial on Friday, said Mityunov, a member of the meeting's
accounting commission.
   Mityunov said 970 people raised pink cards to nominate Sakharov
unanimously and that he accepted.
   Memorial is not officially recognized and thus does not have the
right to nominate candidates, but the meeting was of a group of
Moscow voters rather than a meeting of Memorial.
   The Congress of People's Deputies will consist of 2,250 members,
two-thirds elected on the basis of geographical districts and
one-third from Communist Party, trade union, professional and social
organizations. It will choose more than 400 of its members to form a
new, more active Supreme Soviet Parliament.
   Sakharov, 67, appeared at Sunday's meeting to read a platform he
originally presented to his institute colleagues Friday and to
answer questions, Mityunov said. His platform calls for release of
all prisoners of conscience, freedom of association, more military
cutbacks and economic reforms.
   Sakharov was rejected as a candidate by the prestigious Academy
of Sciences last week, causing an angry protest by his co-workers at
the Lebedev Institute of Physics. They then nominated him as a
candidate from Moscow's Oktyabr district.
   If elected from the Oktyabr region, Sakharov would hold one of 24
seats from Moscow. If elected to the Supreme Soviet, he would be a
member of the Soviet of the Union, the house in the Supreme Soviet
whose representatives are elected on the basis of geographical
districts.
   If elected on the basis of the nomination Sunday, Sakharov would
represent all of Moscow and be a member of the Soviet of
Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet, which will provide
representation in the highest legislative body for all of the more
than 100 ethnic groups that make up the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov's nomination now goes to an electoral commission that
will select the candidates to actually be placed before voters March
26. It could put forward all of those nominated, but it also could
reduce the number to only one. No date has been set for its meeting.

   Authorities suspect a West German
company shipped equipment to Iraq that could be used to make
chemical weapons, a prosecutor said Sunday.
   Darmstadt prosecutor Thomas Brand said documents seized from
offices of the Preussag company of Hanover indicate it shipped
containers and other equipment to Iraq that ``with relative
certainty, could have been used in the production of chemical
weapons.'' Brand spoke in an interview broadcast by Hamburg-based
Spiegel TV network.
   It is not against West German law to ship Iraq industrial goods.
The legal issue is whether the company knew the consignments would
be used to produce chemical weapons.
   The documents, some seized in 1987, also indicate the company
delivered specialized equipment to Iraq that could be used to
produce poison gas shells and bombs, he said.
   No charges have been filed, Brand said.
   Preussag's administrative offices in Hanover and Darmstadt were
closed Sunday, and company officials could not be reached for
comment.
   Brand's office is investigating three other West German companies
in connection with sales to Iraq. The prosecutor has jurisdiction in
the case because Preussag owns a subsidiary near southern Darmstadt.
   Brand last week named two of the companies, Karl Kolb GmbH and
Co. and the now-defunct Pilot Plant company. He refused to name the
third company under investigation.
   Brand said his allegations are based on ``preliminary
evaluations'' and investigations are continuing to determine whether
export laws have been broken.
   Investigators are focusing on a West German law that requires an
export license to ship arms, hazardous substances or components that
can be used to produce them. In addition, a wide-ranging law forbids
such exports to areas of conflict.
   Other news reports have linked West German technicians and
scientists to production of biological weapons in Iraq.
   The West German government has said it has indications such a
plant may operate in Iraq but no evidence of German participation.
   Brand's comments came as controversy continued over alleged
involvement by West German companies in such sales to Iraq and Libya.
   At least two West German companies are under criminal
investigation in connection with a suspected Libyan chemical weapons
factory, and investigators are investigating a Munich-based company
suspected of helping Libya develop the capability to refuel
warplanes in flight.
   U.S. officials contend the Libyan factory in Rabta, south of
Tripoli, is designed to produce poison gas. Libya says the facility
will manufacture pharmaceuticals.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that U.S. officials
received a crucial clue about the Rabta plant's operations after the
deaths of wild dogs in the Libyan desert.
   The newspaper said a toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site
last August apparently killed the dogs and that panicked Libyans
breached security by using international phone lines to call a
German firm helping them build the plant.
   Allegations that West German companies were involved in the
Middle East sales and the Libyan plant have stunned and embarrassed
the West German government and dominated news media here for three
weeks.
   On Sunday, the Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported
that government officials, furious over the way the investigation
has been handled, are demanding the resignation of West Germany's
intelligence chief.
   Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost called the report ``pure
speculation.''

   Burglars had struck Dave Pastorek's gas
station twice in three days, making off with a total of more than
$3,000.
   Then on Friday, a big manila envelope arrived in the mail and
Pastorek figured it was more bad news, maybe from his lawyer or
accountant.
   Inside, a note read:
   ``I am sorry.
   ``I drank too much and broke into your station on a dare.
   ``I am sorry.''
   Along with the note, he found $167 in cash, and checks and credit
card receipts worth about $1,600 _ everything that had been stolen
from the station one week earlier.
   ``I about died,'' said Pastorek, 30. ``We figure his conscience
was bothering him, and he probably wasn't able to sleep for four or
five nights.''
   Now, he said, he's waiting for the burglar who hit Jan. 16 to get
a case of the guilts. That one got away with about $1,400 in
receipts.
   ``If the first guy did it on a dare, I'm wondering if maybe the
second guy was the one who dared him. Maybe after he saw it could be
done, he decided to try it himself,'' Pastorek said.
   Coincidentally, the city kicked off an honesty campaign last
week, directed by the Columbus Commission on Ethics and Values.
   The head of the commission is Jeb Stuart Magruder, a Watergate
conspirator who is now a Presbyterian minister.

   A Russian Orthodox Church leader is nominated in a
country where believers long have been repressed. Leading reformers
are not chosen to carry out major reforms. A faithful worker starts
a protest hunger strike.
   This is the bewildering world of Soviet campaigning, one third of
the way into the race for March 26 elections.
   It has raised questions about how much democracy there is in the
new political system of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and
it mirrors the complex processes going on in his country.
   ``I believe a more democratic mechanism of nominating candidates
is needed,'' said Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov, whose
candidacy was rejected by the Academy of Sciences and who now finds
himself in the middle of one of the biggest disputes.
   Sakharov and thousands of others have been nominated at meetings
of the Communist Party, trade unions, professional organizations and
residents of geographical areas for seats in the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies.
   The Congress will meet annually and will choose the Soviet
president and members of a new, smaller and more active Supreme
Soviet.
   Promoting the new system, Gorbachev said in December that
political reforms are essential. ``It is only by combining economic
reform with political changes, democratization and glasnost
(openness), that we can fulfill both the immediate and long-term
tasks we have set ourselves,'' he said. Stronger local and national
legislatures are essential, Gorbachev said.
   One third of the deputies are being chosen not on the traditional
basis of geographic districts, but from the party, unions,
professional organizations and other officially recognized groups.
   Issues espoused by those attending nominating meetings have
affected the outcome.
   The Tass news agency reported that Metropolitan Alexei, whose
Russian Orthodox diocese includes Leningrad and Estonia, has been
nominated by workers of an agricultural complex because of his
concern over ecological issues. The law specifically allows clerical
candidates. Though there are promises of reform, Soviet churches
still are under Stalin-era laws that require they be registered and
prevent them from organizing religious education or charity.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Sunday that the
Central Council of Trade Unions refused to endorse reformist
economist Tatyana Zaslavskaya because of her call for price
increases to right the economy. It did endorse its chairman, Stepan
Shalaev, who called for more vacation time.
   Others besides Sakharov question whether the system is
democratic, and its complexity is causing a scramble for nominations
in a country where voting has been little more than the ritual of
electing a slate approved by authorities.
   Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution,
which enshrines the Communist Party as the leading and guiding force
of Soviet society.
   Rank-and-file party members nominated 31,500 candidates for 100
seats. But on Jan. 10 the policy-making Central Committee
recommended 100 of them and the ruling Politburo put them on the
ballot, ensuring that although a multitude of voices were heard
early in the process, there will be no choices to make on election
day.
   Sakharov's colleagues at the Lebedev Institute of Physics
complained bitterly last week when the 67-year-old dean of the
Soviet human rights movement and other leading proponents of reform
were passed over for nomination by the Academy of Sciences.
   At the academy, as well as other organizations and electoral
districts, nominations must be winnowed by an official electoral
commission.
   A group of several hundred people at Sakharov's institute
unanimously complained the academy's electoral commission was
elitist, formed only from high-ranking members who selected others
of similar rank. That left out Sakharov and others like space
scientist Roald Sagdeev and economists Gavril Popov and Nikolai
Shmelev.
   The complexity of the electoral process allowed Sakharov's
supporters to nominate him from a geographical district instead, and
they said more nominations were expected to increase his chances of
being on the final ballot. Elsewhere, the complexity allowed
reformist writers Ales Adamovich and Yegor Yakovlev to be nominated
by the filmmaker's union rather than the writers' union, which is
split by bitter differences between liberals and conservatives.
   In Leningrad, Tass said 55-year-old factory worker Gennady
Bogomolov declared a monthlong hunger strike Friday because the
committee at his factory refused to hold a meeting to nominate him.
   Bogomolov, a winner of the government's State Prize, said party
officials pressured the workers' council not to nominate him because
of longstanding differences over pay and restructuring the economy,
Tass said.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda displayed on its front page
Friday the text of a telegram saying two scientists and a journalist
had gone on a hunger strike in Stavropol, a city where Gorbachev
once served as Communist Party chief, because city officials refused
to allow them to organize a local nominating meeting.

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
settling with apparent ease into their new life at 668 Saint Cloud
Road, returned to an unusual standing ovation Sunday at the church
where they worshiped before entering the White House.
   ``God ... has answered our prayers for you and for Mrs. Reagan
and I want you to know we are very pleased to welcome you back, and
thank God for what you were able to do for your country in these
last eight years,'' the Rev. Donn Moomaw of Bel Air Presbyterian
Church told Reagan.
   The congregation, disregarding a precautionary note in the church
bulletin against applauding during the service, stood and gave the
Reagans a prolonged round of hand-clapping.
   ``We probably won't be doing that every Sunday you come,'' Moomaw
said.
   The Reagans, seated near the back of the hilltop church, later
took part in the Presbyterian communion service, in which wafers and
grape juice are brought to the worshipers at their seats, and joined
in the singing of ``Amazing Grace.''
   Moomaw preached on a text from Ephesians 2 reading, in the
translation he used, ``It is by grace that you have been saved
through faith and not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, not by
works, so that no one can boast.''
   Well-wishers lined a rope line outside the church as the Reagans
entered and left the church. People said, ``Nice to have you back''
and ``Welcome home'' and ``He looks so good.''
   The Reagans were greeted on arrival by Frank McDougall, a deacon
and 20-year member of the church who oversees parking, and by Carl
Vann, the head usher, with a white carnation in his lapel.
   The Reagans moved here Friday from the White House after he
completed an eight-year assignment in Washington as president of the
United States.
   Clusters of red, white and blue balloons and a ```Welcome Ron and
Nancy'' sign remained up at one nearby house over the weekend, but
otherwise the Reagans' new street looked like your average
neighborhood of multi-million dollar residences.
   ``Will he make a change?'' Jeffrey Hyland, a real estate
executive who lives near the Reagans, repeated the question to
himself before answering. ``Maybe for a couple of weeks,'' he said.
``After that I think everything will be back to normal.''
   Small knots of tourists gathered along the narrow winding street
from time to time over the weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of the
former president and first lady.
   The Reagans' son, Ron, drove up in a red sports car and visited
for about half an hour. While he was there, he and his parents
appeared on a walkway that is visible from the road and waved.
   Occasionally, tour vans stopped in front of the Reagans' place _
a new stop on an established route that includes the homes of
neighbors Zsa Zsa Gabor and Elizabeth Taylor.
   Flowers were delivered for Mrs. Reagan. A Secret Service man came
outside the walls for a moment.
   But the elaborate security that was in effect when Reagan visited
here as president over the Christmas and New Year's holidays was
gone. No longer was the street blocked off at both ends and security
cars parked along its length.
   The Reagans continue to receive around-the-clock Secret Service
protection.
   ``We won't give you the specifics of what they are going to get,
how much,'' said Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams in Washington.
``It would really be kind of self-defeating for us to do that.''
   Hyland, the new neighbor, estimated security had been scaled back
by 80 percent.
   The Reagans will continue to be driven by the Secret Service.
There was a 10-car caravan when they arrived Friday after the flight
from Washington.
   ``They come and go and are in and out of the driveway in 10
seconds and down the street,'' said Hyland. ``I don't think it's
going to be much of a problem.''
   Like all the streets in the fashionable hillside neighborhood
called Bel-Air, Saint Cloud has no sidewalks _ apparently part of an
effort to protect its exclusivity when it was first laid out as a
haven for blue bloods in the 1920s.
   In a television interview broadcast on the CBS program ``60
Minutes'' on Jan. l5, Mrs. Reagan, looking ahead to life after the
White House, said not being on the front pages would be ``fine with
me.''
   ``I will not miss being under the microscope,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   Indeed, attention is already shifting to President Bush and his
wife Barbara as they get settled in at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and
away from the Reagans as they get settled in on Saint Cloud Road.
   ``We have our share of rubberneckers, but we have always had
them,'' said Hyland. ``The novelty, I think, is going to very
quickly wear off.''
   As for the Reagans, they said during the flight from Washington
that they still have unpacking to do.
   ``Up to now, I've been doing that,'' the former first lady told
reporters. Asked whether the president was good at unpacking, she
just laughed.

<HEAD>Gandhi's Party Appears Headed For Setback In Key Southern State</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party
appeared headed for a setback Sunday in a state election seen as a
barometer for national races later this year.
   The Congress party was not expected to win the legislative
contest in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. But a respectable
showing against the strong regional parties would have bolstered the
Gandhi party's national image.
   ``The voting trend shows a major setback for Gandhi. ... He will
have to accept most of the blame,'' said the state's top political
analyst, Cho Ramaswamy.
   The frontrunner for the Tamil Nadu state assembly seats was the
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party, or Dravidian Progressive Front,
headed by screenwriter and politician Muthuvel Karunanidhi.
   With more than half the ballots from Saturday's election counted,
Karunanidhi's party or its allies led in 151 of the 232
constituencies, the government election control room reported.
   The state assembly has 234 seats, but elections in two districts
were postponed due to the deaths of candidates.
   The Congress Party was ahead in 35 districts.
   Gandhi must call a national parliamentary election before the end
of the year. The races will decide which party governs India for the
next five years.
   A surprise victory could have encouraged Gandhi to call early
national elections before the various opposition groups join
together in sufficient strength to unseat Congress.
   ``The results will have an effect on national politics,'' said
Ramaswamy.
   State elections also were conducted Saturday in the northeastern
states of Nagaland and Mizoram, but results were expected to come in
more slowly than those in Tamil Nadu.
   The other two groups in Tamil Nadu to make a showing were rival
factions of a party splintered between the wife and the leading lady
of late movie star-politician M.G. Ramachandran.
   Former movie actress Jayalalitha Jayaram's faction of the
All-India Anna Dravida Munnestra Kazhagam Party led in 37 districts.
Ms. Jayaram, 42, was a long-time close companion of Ramachandran and
played opposite him in many movies.
   His widow, 64-year-old Janaki Ramachandran, also an ex-actress,
heads a party faction that was leading in four districts.
   Independents led in eight districts. Cold weather delayed
tallying in two other districts.
   Gandhi's most visible national political foe, V.P. Singh, had
backed Karunanidhi.
   Singh served as Gandhi's finance and defense minister before he
was expelled for conducting tax raids on government officials and
inquiries into foreign arms deals. He is trying to unite the Janata
Dal, a loose coalition of three north Indian parties, to muster
enough strength to challenge Gandhi in national elections.
   ``V.P. Singh will project the DMK's victory as his own,''
Ramaswamy said, referring to the Dravida Munnestra Kazhagam Party.
   Singh was not immediately available for comment.
   United News of India said counting would not begin until Monday
in Mizoram state, where some ballot boxes in remote villages had to
be collected by helicopters.
   Gandhi campaigned extensively for his party in the three states
where elections were held Saturday. In all three, strong local
parties traditionally triumph over the Congress.
   Most of the national attention centered on Tamil Nadu, where 36
million people were eligible to vote. The voter turnout was about 69
percent, election officials said.
   Turnouts were higher in the less populous northeastern states.
United News said 80 to 85 percent of the 300,000 eligible voters
showed up in Mizoram, where a 40-member state assembly was being
elected.
   Election officials estimated that 75 percent of Nagaland's
600,000 eligible voters turned out to choose the 60-member state
assembly.

   In the 11 years since he last worked in the
White House, Brent Scowcroft has not minced words about his views on
strategic policies, to the point of openly criticizing the Reagan
administration on occasion.
   Now, in his opening days as President Bush's national security
adviser, Scowcroft is shying away from discussing how his personal
views might translate into Bush administration policy.
   ``The secretary of state should be the chief spokesman for the
president's foreign policy. And the president makes foreign
policy,'' Scowcroft, smiling, said in an interview with The
Associated Press. The national security adviser should be ``not
exactly invisible,'' but certainly not in the spotlight.
   Reticence aside, Scowcroft's influence promises to be as great as
his experience. Bush and Scowcroft worked closely once before, when
Bush was CIA director in 1976 and Scowcroft was national security
adviser to President Ford.
   Scowcroft, 63, said he has gained a sense of perspective since he
began his first job at the White House, as military aide to Henry
Kissinger on the National Security Council staff in 1972. He rose
quickly, from the rank of Air Force colonel to three-star general,
and to national security adviser 1975-77 after Ford replaced Richard
Nixon and Kissinger became secretary of state.
   ``I've probably written and said more about the organization and
the function of the NSC system than...,'' Scowcroft said, pausing,
``...anyone in the country.''
   He has a daunting assignment this time around, to direct a
complete review of U.S. strategic interests, an assessment that many
arms control experts predict will change the American negotiating
position toward the Soviets and in the Pentagon budget that Reagan
sent to Capitol Hill earlier this month.
   The task seems to rest lightly on Scowcroft's thin shoulders. He
is balding and slight, five feet eight inches tall, and weighs 130
pounds, ``probably a little less than I did at West Point, because I
had more muscle then.''
   He keeps trim by jogging about three miles a night, after
watching ABC's ``Nightline'' late night interview show.
   Born in Ogden, Utah, he counts the Mormon Church and his father
as the significant early influences in his life.
   ``There is a notion among the Mormons that at the end of each day
you ought to be able to say, `I've made myself a better person or I
have made things better by what I have done today,'' said Scowcroft.
   But, he said, ``I am not a strict Mormon. I frequently have a
glass of wine with dinner.'' And ``I enjoy coffee. I like to work at
night,'' said Scowcroft, who has disciplined himself to work on four
hours of sleep a night.
   ``Every once in a while, I crash. And when I operate this way, I
fall asleep at the drop of a hat,'' he said.
   ``I learned to do that from Henry Kissinger, who does not require
much sleep, especially on trips ... we used to take. About 1 o'clock
in the morning he would issue to the staff a whole bunch of things
he wanted done by the next morning, then he would go to bed and get
up at 5:30 and expect to have them done,'' said Scowcroft with a
hearty laugh.
   Scowcroft lives in a modest brick home in Bethesda with Marian,
his wife of 37 years. Their daughter Karen works as an attorney in
New York.
   Since leaving the White House and retiring from the military,
Scowcroft has worked in the Washington office of Kissinger's
international consulting firm, and has served as a member of the
commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair and chairman of
a presidential panel on strategic missile basing.
   The basing panel, known as the Scowcroft Commission, charted some
policies that are sharply at odds with those of the Reagan
administration. Scowcroft has come out strongly in favor of a
single-warhead mobile missile, known as the Midgetman.
   And he ridiculed the administration for proposing, at the Moscow
summit, a system to base 10-warhead MX missiles on rail lines on
small bases in the Southwest, a plan he said in an op-ed piece last
year would make them sitting ducks.
   None of these ideas, he has written, make sense under a proposed
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty that would limit the number of both
warheads and delivery vehicles, such as missles and bombers.
   Such a regime, Scowcroft has written, argues for single-warhead
mobile missiles dispersed over a large area, such as the Midgetman.
   However Reagan, in his last budget proposal, killed funding for
the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MX missile, which would be
deployed on rail cars on large bases in the Southwest.
   Scowcroft declines to say publicly what he recommended to Bush on
such issues. Bush, for his part, said during the campaign that he
liked both the MX and the Midgetman, although budget constraints
argue against deploying both.
   Scowcroft prefers to discuss his vision of a White House security
adviser with the leisure ``to try to do some long-range planning, to
sort of look out ahead, to hypothesize the kind of world that we
would like to see, and then to look at the kind of forces that are
at work for or against that kind of world.''
   ``And I think that where we want to go has an importance that it
really hasn't had for much of the 40 years of the Cold War, and that
is, a lot of the old truths, Cold War relations with the allies,
economic relations, all those things are changing now,'' he said.
   ``We are no longer just trying to frantically hold the line in
Europe, for example, to Europe not an incitement to aggression by
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The world has changed vastly since Scowcroft was 12 and read a
book called ``West Point Today.''
   ``I fell in love with West Point, not with the military as such
... I didn't go because I wanted to spend 30 years in the
military,'' said Scowcroft, who spent 29 years in uniform.
   After graduating from West Point in 1947, Scowcroft joined the
newly created Air Force and flew fighters until he crashed in a P-51
Mustang.
   ``I would rather call it a forced landing,'' he said with a
laugh. ``A crash sounds totally uncontrolled.''
   The forced landing crushed three vertebrae, and he spent two
years in a hospital, recuperating and missing the Korean War.
   Denied the opportunity to fly in combat, Scowcroft switched
tracks, earning masters and doctoral degrees from Columbia
University, teaching Russian history at West Point, learning
Serbo-Croatian, and serving as deputy air attache at the U.S.
embassy in Yugoslavia 1959-61.
   Reflecting on his years in uniform and at the White House,
Scowcroft says he would like to be remembered by the epitaph: ``He
served with distinction.''

<HEAD>Successful Breeding Program Sends Red Wolves Back to The Wild</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The effort to reintroduce to the wild an
animal that survived only in captivity is expanding with the
introduction of a pair of red wolves to an island in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   ``It's exciting to know that some are running free at last,''
said David Robinette, the curator of mammals at the Audubon Zoo here.
   The red wolf, smaller and more elusive than its gray cousin, once
roamed the bottomlands of the South from the Carolinas to Texas.
About 100 survive in captivity; the last few wild, purebred red
wolves were captured by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the
late 1970s for captive breeding at the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma,
Wash.
   A few days ago, a pair was released at Horn Island, a wilderness
area off the coast of Mississippi. The male was from Audubon and the
female of the pair was raised at Point Defiance.
   Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves raised at Tacoma have
been released in the Alligator River Refuge in coastal North
Carolina. At least two cubs were spotted last summer.
   A second group of red wolves was reintroduced to the wild on
Bulls Island, S.C., officials said.
   In addition to wolves raised at Tacoma, the Audubon Zoo has added
nine pups to the population and a female and four cubs were sent to
the Tacoma program over the weekend.
   Wildlife officials hope the pair on Horn Island _ now becoming
acclimated in a sprawling penned area _ will breed in February or
early March and produce a litter in April.
   ``The hope is to release them and let them raise the pups as free
from human contact as possible,'' Lewis Greene, the Audubon Zoo's
assistant curator of the red wolf exhibit said. ``Our wolves have
retained some hunting instincts, they'll go after squirrels or birds
that go in their pen, but for the wolves to live in the wild they
have to be total hunters.''
   Horn Island was selected as the breeding site because it provides
plenty of prey.
   ``It's wonderful to have them in exhibits but to maintain the
species the way it should be there has to be natural selection. They
have to live in the wild,'' Robinette said.

   A 74-year-old priest who built a shrine to
Poles killed in the Soviet Union was found dead in his apartment,
and friends and authorities said the evidence points to foul play.
   The Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, provost of the Charles Borromeo
parish, was found dead at his home across the street from the
church, the friends said.
   The priest's apartment appeared to have been ransacked and he was
found lying on the floor with his face bloodied, said Wojciech
Ziembinski, a Polish independence activist who knew the priest.
   An autopsy was scheduled for Monday, said Zofia Romaszewska, an
official of the Solidarity union movement, with which the priest
sympathized.
   She said some things seemed to have been stolen from the
apartment.
   ``Maybe it is simply a plain robbery on a parish, maybe not,''
said Mrs. Romaszewska.
   State radio on Sunday evening reported that the investigation had
shown signs of burglary and pointed toward murder.
   ``Intensive investigation is underway, and investigatons are
being conducted to clear up the circumstances of this tragedy,''
radio said.
   The church where the priest served is a historical sanctuary
within the Powazki cemetery.
   ``A wall is filled with plaques commemorating Poles killed in the
East ... It is the whole of Poish history, reaching as far back as
the 19th century,'' Mrs. Romaszewska said.
   Niedzielak was to have said a Mass on Sunday in honor of Poles
who died in the 1863 January nationalist uprising against the
Russians.
   In 1987, Poland had 527 murders, according to official figures.

<HEAD>Bundy Described As Manipulative, Deceptive Criminal Genius</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Theodore Robert ``Ted'' Bundy, scheduled to
die Tuesday in the electric chair, has been depicted as a diabolical
genius, a handsome and charming figure who, ``like the plague,''
brought death wherever he went.
   The 42-year-old former law student awaits execution for the 1978
murder of Kimberly Diane Leach, a 12-year-old from Lake City.
   Bundy also faces execution for clubbing to death two young women
at a sorority house in Tallahassee three weeks before Miss Leach
disappeared from a schoolyard. He has been called a suspect in the
deaths of as many as 36 women.
   Bundy's attorney, James Coleman, was asked recently why the
public was fascinated with his client. ``He's intelligent,
attractive. He's your next-door neighbor. He's one of us,'' Coleman
said.
   But at a clemency hearing in 1985 for Bundy in the sorority
slayings, Assistant State Attorney Jack Poitinger said, ``Bundy is
like the plague. Everywhere he goes, death follows.''
   State Attorney Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy for the Leach
killing, said he sees two reasons for the public fascination and
revulsion with Bundy.
   ``The mere fact that he is a mass murderer, a serial murderer,
gives rise to a certain degree of notoriety,'' Blair said. ``The
other reason is the persona of Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy does not fit our
stereotypical concept of what a criminal ought to be and what a mass
murderer, in particular, ought to be.''
   ``Bundy is very handsome, he is bright, he's articulate, he's
trained in the legal system. He is all those things that we assume a
mass murderer is not. His very persona contributes to the public's
fascination with the case.''
   U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp in 1987 called him ``a
diabolical genius'' and said he was ``probably the most competent
serial killer in the country at this time.''
   Bundy has been the subject of five books and a TV miniseries,
``The Deliberate Stranger,'' which starred Mark Harmon.
   Bundy has been linked to eight slayings in Washington state in
1974 that became known as the ``Ted'' murders because witnesses
reported seeing a charming young stranger who called himself Ted
near where the victims disappeared.
   In interviews with authorities over the weekend, Bundy is said to
have confessed to those slayings as well as others.
   Bundy became one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives after he
twice escaped custody in Colorado, where he was being held on
charges of murdering a nurse.
   At the time, the FBI said Bundy was sought for questioning in 36
slayings of young women. He was captured in Pensacola in 1978.
   Bundy was believed to have stalked young women near college
campuses, shopping centers and parks, targeting victims with long,
dark hair parted in the middle.
   Prosecutors said he lured victims into his car by posing as a
police officer or by making false requests for aid, sometimes using
crutches as a prop.
   Bundy also became known as an escape artist who could easily
change his appearance and blend into a community.
   He was caught in 1984 in an escape attempt from death row at
Florida State Prison, the state's most heavily guarded penitentiary.
He was found with two hacksaw blades under his mattress and had
already cut through one of the cell bars.
   Bundy was born Theodore R. Cowell on Nov. 24, 1946, in
Burlington, Vt., to a department store clerk, Louise Cowell, at a
home for unwed mothers. His father was described by his mother as a
big-talking sailor home from the war.
   When Bundy was 4, he and his mother moved to Tacoma, Wash., where
she met John Culpepper Bundy at a Methodist church social. They were
married and John Bundy went to work as a cook at the Veterans
Administration Hospital.
   Bundy was a good student but not brillant. He was described as
boisterous and prone to fights on the playground, and shy and
awkward in the classroom.
   He was a Boy Scout and vice president of his church youth group.
He became active in the state Republican Party and received a
glowing letter of recommendation to the University of Utah law
school from then-Washington Gov. Dan Evans.
   Police said that as a young man Bundy began shoplifting things
the family was too poor to buy and was once caught trying to steal a
car. Authorities also said he was obsessed with pornography.
   After his arrest in Pensacola, Bundy told a detective,
``Pornography is one person's pleasure, another person's vice or
downfall.''

<HEAD>Red Cross Workers Return to Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four International Red Cross workers returned to
Beirut on Sunday, just one month after death threats and a
kidnapping prompted the humanitarian organization to scrap its
operations in Lebanon.
   Juergen Bischoff, a spokesman for the Switzerland-based
International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed the arrival of
the workers but declined to give details.
   ``A statement will probably be issued tomorrow in Beirut or in
Geneva,'' he said.
   The International Red Cross announced Dec. 20 that ``serious
threats had been made against its delegates in Lebanon, placing
their lives in acute danger.''
   The decision came four days after kidnappers in Lebanon released
Red Cross official Peter Winkler, who had been held hostage for more
than a month.
   The group behind the kidnapping and a series of death threats
never has been clearly identified. Swiss authorities said the
captors were an otherwise unknown dissident Palestinian group called
Organization of the Socialist Revolution.
   Senior Red Cross officials have been traveling to various Middle
East capitals during the past month in an apparent effort to obtain
guarantees from all parties that they could resume operations
without having to fear violence.
   Fifteen Western foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, most of them believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran.
   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Former Klansman Says Election Signals Change In Voter Sentiment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALBERTO S. FRANCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke said his
top finish in a primary election for state representative signals
renewed voter interest in white supremacy.
   Duke, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
led a field of seven candidates in Saturday's primary election for a
vacant state House seat representing a suburban district that is 99
percent white. Duke received 33 percent of the vote and will face
second-place finisher John Treen in a Feb. 18 runoff. Treen had 19
percent of the vote.
   ``I think the people knew that by my past involvement (with the
Klan), people know that I say what I really believe,'' Duke said
after Saturday's vote. ``The Klan is far behind me, but the effort
for equal rights for everybody is ahead of me.
   ``I think when I win this race you'll find candidates across the
state and across the country begin to talk about the issues I'm
raising. I think this is the beginning of a change in this country.''
   Duke left the Klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell
top-secret membership lists and set up the National Association for
the Advancement of White People. He calls himself a white civil
rights worker.
   Louisiana's open primary system places all candidates on the same
ballot, regardless of party affiliation. If none receives a
majority, there is a runoff election between the top two
vote-getters.
   Saturday's vote in Jefferson Parish represented a 54 percent
turnout of registered voters.
   Duke, 38, ran as a Republican with a campaign platform including
proposed welfare revisions aimed at reducing black births. He said
Saturday that he fully expected the platform to carry him into the
Legislature in February.
   ``I think most people know I am trying to help them,'' he said.
``I think those (racial) issues are hurting our community's economy,
increasing crime....''
   Treen, 68, also a Republican and brother of former Louisiana Gov.
David Treen, said the outcome was due to a solid voting bloc for
Duke and a large field of candidates.
   He disagreed with Duke's claim that the result showed racial
overtones.
   ``I don't think that's true at all. I don't think the people are
trying to send a message to anybody,'' Treen said. ``There were a
number of fine candidates in this race. The vote was split in so
many directions that his lead is not indicative of the direction or
the attitudes of the voters of Jefferson Parish.''
   Treen, who has been endorsed by several local politicians, said
other candidates in the race have committed their support to him in
the runoff.
   Treen is a construction contractor. Duke describes himself as a
professional writer who contributes articles on history and other
subjects to periodicals under a pseudonym, which he said avoids
problems with publication.

<HEAD>Cabinet Questions Tougher Measures As Palestinians Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Sunday debated a policy that
gives troops greater freedom to shoot at Palestinian protesters, and
both Palestinians and Israelis rejected a new peace plan for the
occupied lands.
   In the occupied territories, most shopkeepers closed stores to
observe a strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement,
and the army imposed curfews that confined about 180,000 Arabs to
their homes in several Gaza Strip refugee camps.
   Arab news reports said six Palestinian protesters were shot and
wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip and West
Bank. The army could not confirm the casualties but reported two
other woundings.
   At the weekly Cabinet meeting, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of
the center-left Labor Party criticized the Defense Ministry's
decision to liberalize orders for opening fire on Palestinian
protesters.
   The new rules allow officers and soldiers with special training
to shoot plastic bullets at Arabs who throw stones and set up
roadblocks. Previously, only officers were allowed to fire the
plastic bullets, and only in life-threatening situations.
   ``I think the issue is worth checking,'' Shahal told Israel radio
before the Cabinet meeting, adding that the new orders were
``possibly illegal.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also of Labor, and other
ministers lashed out at Shahal's criticism, the radio said.
   ``We have an emergency situation ... and have to do everything
possible to quell the riots,'' Cabinet Minister Ehud Olmert of the
right-wing Likud Bloc said on Israel Radio.
   Israel radio said Justice Ministry lawyers planned to discuss the
issue with military attorneys later this week.
   Speaking on Israel television after the Cabinet meeting, Labor
leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres defended the use of plastic
bullets, which have been blamed for at least 40 deaths.
   ``Why do we use plastic bullets? Not because it gives us great
pleasure, but because regular bullets cause more deaths,'' he said.
   At least 367 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the
uprising that began Dec. 8, 1987.
   The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has appealed to the
Supreme Court to review and examine the use of plastic bullets,
Israel's Army Radio said.
   According to the independent Hadashot newspaper, the army is
about to introduce a new type of rubber bullet more effective in
dispersing crowds but incapable of penetrating the skin. A military
spokesman refused comment.
   Meanwhile, both Palestinians and Israelis rejected an unofficial
peace proposal put forth Thursday by Rabin, who offered free
elections in the territories in exchange for a cease-fire in the
uprising, peace talks and eventually a confederation between the
occupied lands and Israel or Jordan.
   Bethelehem's Palestinian mayor, Elias Freij told Israel radio the
plan ``will lead nowhere.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization rejected Rabin's plan
Friday.
   The leftist Peace Now movement said the proposal could be viewed
as serious only if accompanied by cancellation of harsh army
policies and the release of detained Arab leaders.
   Within Rabin's own left-leaning Labor, Communications Minister
Gad Yaacobi said that he accepts the plan just ``as an interim
stage, not as a final settlement.''
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, on a two-day visit, called
for direct negotiations with Palestinians to ensure ``peace,
stability and security in the region.''
   ``Peace can only come about only via direct negotiations between
the parties directly involved, and that means mutual, reciprocal
recognition,'' Dumas said after meetings with President Chaim
Herzog, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Peres.
   In the Gaza Strip, assailants presumed to be Palestinians hurled
two firebombs at a bus full of Arab workers breaking a general
strike by reporting to jobs in Israel. The workers fled the burning
bus and no one was injured, an Arab reporter said.
   Also Sunday, a military court in Lod, sentenced three
Palestinians to prison terms of at least 20 years for attacks on
Israel.
   One, a member of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah faction, guided the
suicide driver of last October's car bomb that killed eight Israeli
soldiers in southern Lebanon.

   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France planted
a tree at a Holocaust memorial Sunday in honor of his father, a
French resistance leader who saved Jews during World War II before
the Nazis executed him.
   Dumas, in Israel for a two-day visit, also called on Israeli
leaders to hold direct talks with Palestinians, without specifically
mentioning the PLO.
   ``Peace can only come about only via direct negotiations between
the parties directly involved, and that means mutual, reciprocal
recognition,'' Dumas told a news conference after meeting with
President Chaim Herzog, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Finance
Minister Shimon Peres.
   Speaking on Israel television, Peres said Israel is prepared to
meet with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories, but
would not consider meeting with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which he said engages in ``terror and violence.''
   ``We don't reject a people or a nation, but an organization,''
Peres said.
   Accompanied by Simone Nathan-Asher, one of the French Jews whom
his father, Georges Dumas, saved, the foreign minister laid a wreath
the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial's eternal flame kept alight in
memory of the 6 million Jews who were killed by the Nazis.
   Dumas then walked through the memorial gardens to a special park
dedicated to those non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews. He
planted the foot-high sapling, shoveled earth around it and watered
the small tree.
   ``When you are responsible for public affairs, as I am, the
memories you carry in your soul are always present,'' Dumas said.
   ``I thank you for suggesting this opportunity, in the name of my
father, and ... all those who displayed the necessary behavior,
inspired by a respect for individual rights and a love of liberty,''
he said.
   Dumas said his father Georges, as a member of the resistance,
helped warn Jews in the French town of Limoges of imminent raids,
hid them, and provided them with false documents so they could
escape.
   Among the people whom his father saved was a schoolgirl, Simone
Nathan-Asher, who survived by staying hidden in a monastary, he said.
   Ms. Nathan-Asher broke down in tears as she came forward to
express thanks to Dumas.
   Georges Dumas, a pilot during World War I, was executed by the
Nazis on March 26, 1944, after being identified as a resistance
leader.

   Opposite corners of the nation were wet Sunday with rain and snow
in the Northwest and wind and rain in the Southeast.
   Showers and thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain overnight
in Florida, and the rain continued into Sunday over parts of
Florida, southeastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina.
   Gale force wind accompanied the rain along Florida's northeastern
coast. Wind gusted to 47 mph at Daytona Beach during the afternoon
and to 63 mph at Titusville. Only minor damage was reported, the
National Weather Service said.
   In the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.14 inches of rain fell at
Daytona Beach.
   A cold front spread snow over parts of the Northwest, and a
winter storm warning was issued for southeastern and central
Montana, where up to 8 inches of snow was possible by Monday
morning. Wind gusts to 58 mph were reported at Casper, Wyo.
   Showers spread along the coast of Oregon and northern California.
   Afternoon temperatures remaining below freezing were confined to
Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, upstate New York and northern New
England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees above zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 80 at Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. Sunday morning's low was 24 degrees below zero at Gunnison.
   For Monday, snow was forecast from Montana into northern Colorado
and western Nebraska. Scattered showers were forecast from the
California coast across much of Nevada. A few showers also were
forecast over south-central Texas.
   Highs never rising above freezing were predicted from the central
Rockies to northern Minnesota, and across northern Maine, including
highs only in the upper teens in North Dakota and eastern Montana;
in the 50s and 60s from the California coast through southern
Arizona to the upper Ohio Valley and the Southeast; and in the 70s
in southern Florida and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

<HEAD>Femininity Stars at Opening of French Haute Couture Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix drifted into spring and summer on
a soft pastel cloud, sometimes bursting open with color, at Sunday's
opening of French haute couture collections.
   Femininity, and the unexepected, already prevail in Paris, where
Italy's favorite fashion son, Valentino, will ensure the surprise
ending this year. Abandoning Rome, at least this season, he will cap
the week of French collections on Thursday with his first haute
couture showing in Paris.
   The move, which has unsettled Roman fashion lords, serves to
confirm the pre-eminence of French haute couture, which can set
trends for the entire fashion industry.
   Romance, sometimes smoldering, is clearly the word for summer
from Paris, and chiffon or crepe is the language of love, even in
pants. Sexy sheaths make sure the romance is enticing.
   Hem lengths traveled from the floor to above the knee with no
minis yet in sight. Exaggerated shoulders also disappeared.
   Gold was the prevailing accent, from buttons to loafers at
Lacroix, along with ruffles and wide-brimmed hats.
   Torrente, opening the season, used chiffon dramatically, in
capes, trains or simply as long scarves carressing the neck.
   Sailor themes cropped up as a counterpoint to softness, with
clean marine lines in navy or black and white.
   Leaving Provencal behind for exotic Saharan climes, Lacroix
draped reams of chiffon in flowing pants-skirts reminiscent of a
gust of sand, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk, used lace almost
relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains.
   His palette was above all the beige-tones and exotic pastels like
melon and pistachio, mixed with bright poppy, Persian blue and
black, white and navy.
   Lacroix made good his gift for surprise, mixing rustic and fine
fabrics in his 57 outfits, introducing the fringe and occasionally
poking a hole in his pastel clouds with rhythmic lines and splashes
of loud color.
   Minimizing the waist, the ``trapezium'' and ''pyramid'' shapes
prevailed for day wear at Lacroix.
   It was pure charm in a powder pink shantung tunic which flared
over cocoa-colored, silk linen ``pencil'' pants.
   A pyramid coat-dress in verbena linen, flared above the waist, or
a Persian blue silk trapezium raincoat also had that demure charm.
   Body-skimming softness or smoldering black lace, organza and
raffia took over for after-hours when feminine turns female.
   Lacroix revealed his knack for the spectacular with a few
fringes. For daywear, he dressed up a khaki linen outfit with black
embroidery on top and black fringes dancing on the skirt. A dramatic
after-dark version featured gold and thread woven pajamas with a
beaded floor-length fringe.
   Pants-skirts or strapless jumpsuits, as elegant as gowns, were
often topped with intricate embroidery or lace and warn under
sumptuous jackets.
   Typifying the mood of wistful romance was his number aptly
entitled ``Je t'aime'' (I love you), a drifty vanilla-colored poncho
of organza decorated with hand-painted flowers and collared with
lace, warn over a sandy-colored chiffon pants-skirt.
   His ``piece de resistance'' was the strapless pique floor-length
dress, tenderly flowered and topped with a shawl-like blue ziberline
jacket with fringe.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel
dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow, or tiered dresses
and, always, wide-brimmed hats.
   Elegance by night was, most notably, in black and white.
   Draped chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with
jewels or a bow, were lovely. Smoky chiffon scarves were beautifully
used in dramatic trains, sometimes running from the shoulder.
   There was drama in an almost classic solid black gown, with
lapels at the bodice and a whimsical white and black polka dot
kerchief.
   Hanae Mori ended the day's shows with more accolades to
femininity.
   Her floor-length yellow draped sheath with a line of ruffles
running from the shoulders to the toes is a toast to the female
form. The corsage ruffle at the bust is another note to the refined
sophistication that marked her show.

<TEXT>
   More than 160,000 Japanese filed past a portrait of
the late Emperor Hirohito on Sunday as the Imperial Palace gates
were opened to the public for the first time since the monarch died
two weeks ago.
   Palace officials said 164,300 people had visited by evening
Sunday, the first of three days the palace will be open to the
public. They attributed the large turnout in part to sunny skies.
   A cold morning wind did not stop more than 5,400 people from
gathering at Nijubashi, the palace's main entrance, by 9 a.m., when
a team of police officers pulled the tall, wooden gate open.
   Uniformed police formed a row at the front of the orderly crowd
as it marched slowly toward the East Garden square, where a
gold-framed photograph of Hirohito could be seen behind the
bullet-proof glass of a palace balcony.
   Displays of chrysanthemums, symbols of Japan's monarchy, stood on
either side of the black-and-white photograph, taken when the
emperor was 80 years old. Hirohito died of cancer Jan. 7 at age 87.
   Security around the palace was tight, with traffic sealed off and
at least 600 officers patrolling the grounds. Police watched from
nearby rooftops as visitors stood in a carefully roped-off line that
wound through gravel plazas outside the moated palace.
   Police say at least six ultra-leftist groups, including the
radical Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction, have threatened to
disrupt observances for the emperor. No incidents were reported
Sunday, however.
   Though conservatively clad men and women over 40 made up most of
the morning crowd, extreme rightists dressed in black suits and
black ties were a highly visible presence at the palace.
   One rightist group formed two rows in military style before
bowing to the portrait, as officials tried to shoo news
photographers away.
   Bin Akao, one of Japan's best-known extreme rightists, was
accompanied by about 20 followers in blue uniforms as he folded his
hands as if in prayer before the nearly 6-foot-tall portrait.
   ``We are going to either see a communist revolution or a revival
of patriotism,'' he told The Associated Press. ``These are very
dangerous times.''
   Akao is head of the staunchly anti-communist Great Japan Patriots
Party, which has a membership estimated at up to 5,000.
   ``I experienced the war and coming here today I felt sorry for
the emperor,'' said housewife Michiko Ozeki, 57. ``He must have had
a very hard life, but he was a wonderful man.''
   Government leaders and representatives of various private groups
already have paid their respects to Hirohito, whose state funeral is
scheduled Feb. 24.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli Cabinet gave approval for President
Chaim Herzog on Sunday to attend Hirohito's funeral.
   The Cabinet did not hold a formal vote on Herzog's trip but at
its meeting Sunday, two ministers voiced their opposition, Cabinet
secretary Elyakim Rubinstein said.
   The ministers, David Levy of the hardline Likud bloc and Yitzhak
Peretz of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, contended Herzog should not
pay respects to Hirohito because of Japan's alliance with Nazi
Germany during World War II, Israel radio said.

<HEAD>Inmate Claims Investigators Threatened Him In Prison Guard Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are looking into allegations of
misconduct by investigators in a probe of corruption among prison
guards after an inmate said he was threatened, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   Internal reviews by the district attorney's office and police
department were prompted in part by a work-release prisoner's
complaint that two investigators threatened to hang him, shoot him
or have him raped by other prisoners for refusing to implicate a
guard in an alleged February 1988 beating, The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported.
   The corruption probe, Operation Ferret, has resulted in criminal
charges against 58 prison employees.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified police official as saying
the department is investigating a police detective in connection
with his work on Operation Ferret, but declined to give details.
   Operation Ferret is a two-year inquiry that District Attorney
Ronald D. Castille said last year would eventually result in at
least 100 arrests.
   Through spokesman Terry Williamson, Castille declined to comment.
Williamson said office policy prohibits public comment on any
pending investigation or confirmation of its existence.
   The prisoner who complained of the threats, Brian C. Kauffman,
27, told the Inquirer a member of Castille's staff questioned him
last week about his allegations.
   Last May, according to prison records, Kauffman told a social
worker and a corrections sergeant, who wrote memos about his
complaints to their supervisors, that two investigators had
handcuffed him to a chair and accused him of lying to them about the
alleged February 1988 beating of prisoner William J. Kennedy.
   That beating led to the first wave of arrests last March. Seven
guards were accused of beating Kennedy at a work-release residence
or lying to conceal the incident. Charges against those guards have
been dropped or thrown out.
   Kauffman, serving a 3{-to-seven-year sentence for theft by
deception told authorities last February that he saw no misconduct
by guards on the night of Kennedy's alleged beating.
   Social worker Janet Grossman and Corrections Sgt. Edward Noble
wrote in memos obtained by the Inquirer that Kauffman said he was
taken to the city prisons' internal affairs building and threatened
repeatedly by two investigators whom he could not identify.
   According to the memo, Kauffman said the two men warned him: ``If
you don't say what we want, we are going to hang you from the neck
here in the back room.''
   Former Deputy District Attorney Odell Guyton, who initiated
Operation Ferret and supervised it until December, said he had
received Ms. Grossman's memo, but would not say what he had done in
response.

<HEAD>Trashmen Drummer Steve Wahrer Dies At 47</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROBBINSDALE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Wahrer, the drummer who helped
lift the Trashmen and their hit single, ``Surfin' Bird,'' to the
national pop charts in the early 1960s, has died of throat cancer at
age 47.
   He died Saturday at North Memorial Hospital in this Minneapolis
suburb.
   ``He was the one who snarled out, `The bird is the word,''' said
Bill Diehl, an entertainment writer for the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch. ``They were all clean-cut guys and in their way kind of
shy. They were more interested in music than anything else.''
   Dal Winslow, a founder of the group and now a computer systems
analyst, said Wahrer ``was one of the first drummers to use a heavy,
heavy, foot-pedal beat. A driving, real danceable style. It was pure
rock 'n' roll.''
   In 1962, Wahrer, Winslow, Tony Andreason of Minneapolis and Bob
Reed of North Dakota formed the band.
   Two years later they released ``Surfin' Bird,'' which became an
instant hit, moving up to No. 4 on the national Billboard music
chart.
   The group broke up in 1967 and Wahrer stayed in the Twin Cities,
playing with a variety of bands.
   He played with the Trashmen in revival concerts until about a
year ago, when he became ill.
   Wahrer is survived by his father, Stephen, of Robbinsdale, and
sisters Suzy McCasland of Shoreview and Vicki Wahrer of Coon Rapids.
   Services are scheduled Tuesday in Minneapolis.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested up to 500 people
who tried to attend a vigil at the grave of a student who burned
himself to death to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, activists
said Sunday.
   The protesters were arrested in the village of Vsetaty, 18 miles
from Prague and the hometown of Jan Palach, who killed himself in
Wencensclas Square in January 1969.
   Activist Petr Uhl said between 400 and 500 people who tried to
hold a vigil at the heavily guarded cemetery where Palach is buried
were arrested on Saturday. Police had blocked roads and interrogated
visitors on Saturday.
   The arrests bring to 800 the number of people held during a week
of anti-government protests, the biggest wave of unrest in the
Czechoslovakia in 20 years.
   A heavy police presence in Prague and Vsetaty, threats of
prosecution and the hundreds of arrests appeared to have stilled the
protests by Sunday.
   Uhl, a member of the Charter 77 activist group, said police
detained people Saturday who could not prove they were Vsetaty
residents. He said most were taken to a nearby state farm,
questioned, photographed and released.
   Uhl said two activists, Ludvik Marks of the independent youth
group Czech Children and Martin Litomirsky of the Democratic
Initiative, apparently had been detained overnight.
   Uhl also reported that Havel's lawyer had seen the jailed
activist on Friday. He said the activists could face charges with
penalities of up to three years in jail.
   The protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of social
and economic reforms similiar to those implemented by Mikhail
Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, said Alexander Dubcek, whose ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of Czechoslovakia were crushed by Soviet troops in
1968.
   Dubcek was ousted as former Communist Party chief in
Czechoslovakia by the Soviets in August 1968 after a fleeting
attempt to introduce many of the reforms now embraced by Gorbachev.
   Dubcek was interviewed by telephone by the Italian Communist
Party daily l'Unita, which carried a front-page story on Sunday. He
was asked to comment on the current wave of protests in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``There is a basic crisis that involves, above all, the young
people, the 20-year-old children of the Prague Spring ... who have
no future,'' Dubcek was quoted as saying.
   ``What young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type
underway in the Soviet Union, that involves even the party for the
first thing,'' Dubcek said in the interview.
   The latest protests began on Jan. 15, when about 5,000 activists
tried to hold a vigil for Palach in Wenceslas Square. Police broke
up the crowd with tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people.
   Palach had set himself on fire in the square to protest the
Soviet invasion that led to Dubcek's ouster.
   On Jan. 16, Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident, banned
playwright Vaclav Havel, and 12 other prominent activists were
detained after trying to lay flowers in memory of Palach. They are
still in jail, and fellow activists say it appears they will face
charges that could jail them for up to two or three years.
   Mlada Fronta said Saturday that 280 people were detained Thursday
during the week's worst violence, when riot police charged a crowd
of more than 2,000 and beat several people in Prague.

<HEAD>Party Leader Denounces Calls For His Ouster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist party chief Stipe Suvar
denounced calls for his ouster and warned that the economically and
ethnically troubled country could fall victim to political
extremism, a published report said Sunday.
   Suvar also predicted frank discussions at a Central Committee
meeting this week of the ruling League of Communists, but implied he
expected to withstand an effort to run him out of office.
   The party chief has been the focus of unprecedented attacks by
Serbian leaders that reflect the hard-line stance of the Serbian
communist party led by Slobodan Milosevic, who is believed to have
presidential aspirations.
   Suvar, president of the executive Presidium, accused ``sections''
of the party, media and various political meetings of being
``maximally concentrated on dismembering the current ... Central
Committee and its Presidium and ... on eventually replacing,
blocking and fully compromising its current president.
   ``The tension in the country has increased and so has the concern
of the great majority (of Yugoslavs) for the fate of socialism in
our country,'' he said in an interview on Zagreb television Saturday
night that was carried by newspapers Sunday.
   Suvar warned that rifts in the country's leadership comprised a
``clash of concepts'' that could lead the country to extremes,
either restoration of a ``bourgeois'' system or ``neo-Stalinism.
   There has been increasing unrest in Yugoslavia where inflation is
hovering at 250 percent, living standards are sinking and the
country is burdened by a $21 billion foreign debt.
   Suvar said he was ``deeply convinced'' that the League of
Communists' Central Committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday would
be marked by ``a completely open discussion ... and we must no
longer play hide and seek.''
   The Central Committee meeting is widely expected to reflect
deepening rifts in the Yugoslav leadership and result in a clash
between liberal factions in the party and a hard-line coalition led
by Milosevic.
   ``We must call matters ... relations ... and persons by their
true name,'' Suvar said in the interview, adding that he was ready
``to fully account for everything before the Central Committee which
elected me to the Presidium, and before the presidium which elected
me (its) president.''
   Suvar has been accused at numerous party meetings in Serbia and
in the republic of Montenegro of allegedly opposing mass street
demonstrations that forced the ouster of the entire Montenegrin
ruling elite. A communist party conference in the province of
Vojvodina also called for his ouster last week.
   The protests were seen in the northern republics of Croatia and
Slovenia as having been orchestrated by Milosevic supporters to
bring Montenegro under tighter political control by Serbia.
   However, Suvar, a Croat, indicated he did not expect the
communist leadership to replace him, saying he hoped to remain party
chief for the remaining six months of his tenure.
   Suvar suggested that people taking part in mass rallies that
forced the resignations of numerous Serbian and Montenegrin leaders
allegedly opposed to Milosevic were being ``led astray ... by
demagogues.
   ``We can depose leaderships,'' he said, but warned, ``such an
atmosphere ... would lead us to disaster.''
   In another development, the Tanjug news agency reported a
communist party meeting in the Croatian town of Zlatar Bistrica on
Saturday demanded that Milosevic, as a member of the Yugoslav
communist Party Presidium, be called to account for
``moral-political responsibility'' over his not reacting to
``unargumented attacks'' on Suvar at the Vojvodina party conference.
   Much of last year's unrest has centered on the province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of more than 90
percent. Serbia is the largest republic, and both provinces, Kosovo
and Vojvodina, are part of it but not fully subject to its control.

<HEAD>Opposition Alliance Picks Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition coalition on Sunday
formally selected attorney Guillermo Endara as its candidate in the
May 7 presidential election.
   In a related development, the Panamanian military accused the
United States of harassing Panamanians.
   Endara, 52, pledged to form a ``government of national
reconstruction'' and replace Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
Panama's Defense Forces and country's de facto ruler.
   The opposition alliance also selected Ricardo Arias Calderon, 53,
as candidate for first vice president and Guillermo Ford, 52, as
second vice president.
   Arias Calderon, a former vice presidential candidate, is
president of the Democratic Christian Party. Ford, a businessman, is
a member of the executive committee of the National Liberal
Republican Movement Party.
   Calderon described the May 7 balloting as a ``plebescite'' on
Noriega's rule.
   ``Let's go into the streets to end this regime,'' said Arturo
Vallarino, a delegate from the Republican party. ``We have the
spirit to rebel and not submit.''
   The Civic Crusade and several other small opposition parties took
part in the convention along with the Democratic Christian Party and
the National Liberal Republican Movement.
   Another opposition party,, the Authentic Liberal Party, plans a
nominating convention next week and the seven-party government
coalition will announce its candidate on Feb. 1.
   Meanwhile, Noriega's Defense Forces on Sunday accused U.S. troops
of having ``intensified their campaign of persecution'' against
Panamanians entering areas under U.S. control.
   ``This campaign of persecution includes threats with firearms,
insults, illegal and unnecessary interrogations, arbitrary arrest,
the excessive use of force, cruel and degrading treatment,'' the
Defense Forces said in a press release.
   The statement said the interrogations are conducted by U.S.
military intelligence agents trying to obtain information about
Panama's internal affairs.
   The Defense Forces said U.S. troops have no right to detain
Panamanian citizens and it urged people who are detained to ``remain
calm,'' refuse to sign any documents and demand to see a Panamanian
military policeman.
   U.S. Southern Command spokesman Bill Ormsbee said he would have
no comment Sunday on the Defense Forces statement.
   The Defense Forces said the ``campaign of persecution'' is worst
along the Panama Canal near Southern Command headquarters. The
command has about 13,000 troops guarding the canal, which will be
turned over to Panamanian control in the year 2000.
   Tensions between U.S. and Panamanian troops have been high since
the United States began trying last year to force Noriega to
relinquish power. A U.S. federal grand jury has indicted Noriega on
drug trafficking charges.

<DATELINE>UTUADO, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of relatives, friends and
Air Force officials flocked Sunday to the small, mountainous town of
Utuado for the funeral of the Puerto Rican pilot whose plane was
shot down during a U.S. raid on Libya.
   The remains of Air Force Maj. Fernando Ribas Dominicci, 33,
arrived in Puerto Rico on Friday, three years after his plane was
shot down in the Libyan attack.
   ``It is a miracle. For three years I prayed to Jesus Christ to
return my son,'' said the pilot's tearful mother, Teresa Dominicci
de Ribas. ``I asked `where is he, who has him?' And although I never
personally got an answer, he returned.''
   During the half-hour ceremony at the hillside San Andres de
Utuado cemetery, four F-111 bombers, the type Ribas Dominicci
piloted, flew over the small town, about 35 miles west of San Juan.
   The airman's wife, Blanca Berain, held their 7-year-old son's
hand and wept as the bombers flew in a ``Missing Pilot'' formation.
   Thousands flocked to the cemetery for the service and police said
they couldn't estimate the size of the multitude, which appeared to
be slightly less than half the size of Utuado's 30,000 population.
   Air Force Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Carl Smith and Gen. Sam
Westbrook, commander of the Lakenheath base in England where the
pilot was stationed, gave eulogies.
   ``Fernando belongs to history. He returns as an example to all,
to inspire us about what to be and what to do,'' said Westbrook in
his eulogy. ``He is a true heroe, an exemplary model for all.''
   Westbrook said he would ask that Ribas Dominicci be awarded the
Silver medal, one of the highest awards recognizing bravery in
combat.
   Libya initially had identified the body as that of the other
pilot killed in the raid, Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of San Francisco.
Both men were in the same F-111 bomber that was lost during the U.S.
raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. An estimated 40 Libyans were killed in
the raid.
   The body was returned during a period of international debate
over a Libyan plant the United States says can produce chemical
weapons, and nine days after U.S. fighters shot down two Libyan jets
over the Mediterranean.

   Nearly 90 youths returned to the capital
Sunday after an week-long journey from a rebel camp, where they had
fled to excape a military crackdown last year, a student said.
   Maung Pe Win, 23, a law student from Rangoon University, said
about 250 youths remained at the U Thuta camp near the Thai border.
Most wanted to return, he said, but three student leaders dissuaded
them, saying the military would kill those who returned.
   He said about 60 percent of students in the border areas have
become ill and six died at U Thuta camp.
   About 100 set out on foot Jan. 14 from U Thuta, but illness
forced 13 to drop out in villages along the seven-day walk to
Kamamaung in Karen state, Pe Win said. From there, the military
transported the 87 remaining youths, mostly students, to Thaton
camp, about 100 miles east of Rangoon, and then to Rangoon to return
to their homes.
   The U Thuta camp is controlled by the Karen National Union, one
of about a dozen ethnic groups fighting the central government for
greater autonomy. Thousands of youths fled to such camps after the
Sept. 18 military coup led by Gen. Saw Maung.
   About 2,000 have returned home, some by land and others by air
from Thailand.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Army is pulling out of
Afghanistan with a sense of having failed its mission, a Soviet
commander said Sunday.
   ``We have not succeeded in everything we planned to do here,''
Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, a political officer at the military high
command in Kabul, told Western correspondents.
   ``We came here with an honorable task, with open hearts ... We
are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our
mission to the end.''
   Serebrov, dressed in camouflage uniform, chain-smoking and joking
occasionally with reporters, said Soviet officers are communicating
with guerrilla commanders on parts of the key Salang highway, the
main route to the Soviet border, to try to keep it open so that
supplies may get through.
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April, the Soviets'
100,000 troops began leaving Afghanistan on May 15, and half were
out by Aug. 15. The remainder are to leave by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets announced late last year they had indefinitely
suspended the withdrawal of the remaining troops because of
continued U.S. and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas.
   Serebov disputed reports from Western diplomats in Kabul that the
withdrawal already resumed in earnest in early January.
   However, Afghan troops now are manning former Soviet posts on the
perimeter of this beleaguered capital, not far from guerrilla
positions.
   And hundreds of fully equipped Soviet troops can be seen boarding
giant Ilyushin 76 transport aircraft ferrying in and out of the
airport daily.
   Asked how the Soviets planned to evacuate troops by air and up
the hazardous, 250-mile Salang highway by Feb. 15 in bitter winter
weather, Serebrov noted: ``That's our problem.''
   Pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving, Serebrov,
speaking through an interpreter, argued that the departing troops
had merely completed their two-year military service and ``are being
replaced with new ones.''
   ``We are ready ... to end the withdrawal by Feb. 15, but we have
not yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal,''
he said.
   He dodged questions about reports, including from one Soviet
source in Kabul, that the military high command will move from the
Afghan capital to the town of Hairatan on the Soviet border between
Jan. 31 and Feb. 2. Asked how the commanders will go if they remain
in Kabul until the deadline, he said, ``We will find a way.''
   The Red Army entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back up
government troops in their war with the Moslem guerrillas.
   As the Soviets have left, the guerrillas have closed in on Kabul,
raising fears of a bloodbath once Afghanistan's conscript army is
left alone.
   ``There could be some instability ... but I don't think it will
be critical,'' Serebrov said.
   Soviet officers have privately expressed serious reservations
about the ability of the Afghan army to fight alone.
   Serebrov said the Soviets, who last week began an airlift of
emergency food and fuel to Kabul, ``have to feed the whole city
now.''
   Shortages are worsening in the capital, with bread queues forming
in sub-freezing temperatures and roads clogged with lines of cars
and buses at gasoline stations.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda accused the
resistance of buying up food supplies in the capital and spiriting
them out of the city.
   It quoted Defense Minister Shakh Navaz Tanay as saying that
during a sweep of the city in search of weapons, soldiers found
``big supplies of food and goods of priority need.''
   Supply roads into Kabul have been blocked periodically in January
by resistance attacks and by heavy snows. Pravda said supply trucks
started getting through the snow and rebel attacks again on Jan. 19.
   Serebrov acknowledged that the Soviet air force is continuing
bombing raids on guerrilla positions.
   But he accused the United States of repeated violations of the
U.N. accord by continuing to arm the seven-group guerrilla alliance
through neighboring Pakistan.
   ``That is why the situation around Afghanistan is so tense,'' he
said. ``This is not because of the presence of Soviet troops in the
country.''
   He paused and then compared the planned withdrawal favorably with
the U.S. pullout from Vietnam.
   He told an American reporter: ``Your generals ran away from
Saigon. But we have a withdrawal that is proceeding according to a
timetable.''
   Serebrov's surprise meeting with the small group of Western
reporters came after a news blackout of several weeks by the Soviet
command.

   At least 24 people, including four
Indian soldiers, were killed across Sri Lanka in separatist violence
during the weekend, mililtary officials said Sunday.
   The officials who cannot be identified under standing briefing
regulations, said 16 Sinhalese were killed in seven separate attacks
since Saturday.
   The attacks were blamed on the People's Liberation Front, an
organization of radical Sinhalese oppopsed to Colombo's peace
overtures to the Tamils fighting for a separate homeland in the
Indian ocean republic since 1983.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
allege they are discriminated by the Sinhalese who account for about
75 percent of the people.
   The front says that Colombo was offering too many concessions to
the Tamils.
   In the Tamil-dominated north, four Indian soldiers were killed
Saturday when ambushed by the most powerful of the Tamil separatrist
group, the Liberation Tiger's of Tamil Eelam. The attack occured at
Vavunia, 135 miles north of Colombo.
   India has an estimated 44,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce the
July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil secessionist
campaign.
   Factional fighting among Tamil separatrist group left at least
two dead and Indian troops killed two suspected Tamil rebels in
Vavunia district, the officials said.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas fired into a
crowd on Sunday, killing three people and wounding 15 in this Andean
city, officials said.
   About 1,000 residents of this shantytown were in an outdoor
community meeting with the mayor, Ricardo Bohoquez, when eight
gunmen opened fire on the crowd with pistols and machine guns,
police said.
   Huancayo police said Bohoquez, who was wounded twice in the
chest, was the target of the attack. The assailants also hurled
dynamite during the attack, police said.
   Police blamed members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla
movement, which began an insurrection in 1980 in an effort to set up
a Marxist state in Peru. More than 12,000 people have died in the
uprising. Many attacks are aimed at local governent officials in
rural villages.

<HEAD>Nude Man Strolls Through Restaurant, Is Arrested in Fatal Hit-Run</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nude man shouting ``Hail Satan'' as he
strolled through a popular beachfront restaurant was arrested and
later linked to a fatal hit-run crash, authorities said Sunday.
   Brian L. Harlow, 28, of Malibu allegedly was driving a stolen
pickup truck involved in the Pacific Coast Highway crash minutes
before the Friday night restaurant escapade that led to his arrest,
said Officer Monte Keifer of the California Highway Patrol.
   Harlow, hospitalized briefly for observation at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center, was booked for investigation of murder and was being
held without bail Sunday at the Los Angeles County Jail, Keifer said.
   Startled diners at the Chart House restaurant avoided conversing
with the nude man as he ``strolled casually through the restaurant
showing himself to all the tables,'' said manager Greg Butler. He
then sat at an unoccupied table.
   ``A waiter told him he'd better leave and he said he was Satan
and he was going to die. We left him alone, hoping the sheriffs
would show up,'' Butler said. Dozens of customers looked and
giggled, he said.
   Five minutes after entering the restaurant yelling ``Hail
Satan,'' he walked through the crowded bar to an outside patio and
down to a rocky outcropping on the beach, where he was detained by
authorities.
   A pickup Harlow left running in the restaurant parking lot was
involved in a fatal accident Friday at 11:40 p.m. in Corral Canyon,
said CHP Officer Richard Perez. The truck had been reported as
stolen.
   ``The pickup driver hit a motorcycle from behind, rear-ended it,
then kept going,'' the officer said.
   The 22-year-old passenger on the motorcycle, a recently
discharged sailor from Norfolk, Va., was killed. Identification was
withheld until relatives could be contacted. The motorcyclist
suffered minor injuries, Perez said.

   A strong earthquake registering 6.1 on the Richter
scale hit northern Japan early Monday, the Central Meteorological
Agency said. Local police said there were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
   The agency said the quake's was centered 24 miles below the
seabed off the coast of the city of Kushiro, 556 miles northwest of
Tokyo, on the northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
   The tremor, which occurred at about 7:20 a.m. (5:20 p.m. EST),
registered a 3 on the Japanese scale of 7 in the Hokkaido cities of
Kushiro, Obihiro, Urakawa and Hiroo, the agency said.
   A tremor measuring three on the Japanese scale is described as
``rather strong,'' one that can shake houses and buildings and cause
hanging objects such as electric lamps to swing.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale is considered ``severe,'
capable of widespread damage if it hits a populated area.
   The Japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a
particular location.

<TEXT>
   A drifter who said his fascination with
American Indians led him to pose as one is on trial for the killings
of three Indian women.
   Testimony was to start Monday in the trial of Billy Richard
Glaze, 44, who is charged with six counts of first-degree murder in
the mutilation deaths of the women. The trial is expected to last
six to eight weeks.
   Many in Minneapolis' American Indian community say they are
relieved to see the case go to trial.
   ``People are happy that someone has been caught and questioned
and is going on trial for the murders,'' said Frances Fairbanks,
director of the American Indian Center in a neighborhood near
downtown, where the bodies were found.
   ``Hopefully he's the right one,'' said the head of security for
the American Indian Movement's AIM Patrol, who identified himself
only as Bear. The group polices Indian neighborhoods.
   Glaze had pleaded innocent to the charges. He is being held on $2
million bail.
   The victims _ Kathleen Kay Bullman, Angeline Whitebird-Sweet and
Angela Kay Greene _ all were patrons of Franklin Avenue bars, where
police say they believe the women met their killer.
   Their bodies were mutilated and posed in suggestive positions
after their deaths, prompting Minneapolis police homicide head Jack
McCarthy to term the slayer ``a vicious killer'' who was ``making
some kind of a statement.''
   Glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be
an Indian because American Indians fascinated him, and federal
authorities said he used aliases including Jesse Settingcrow and
Jesse Sitting Crow.
   Peter Cahill, Glaze's lawyer, would not discuss the case.
   Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Pete Connors said prosecutors
would not comment.
   A grand jury heard testimony from 50 witnesses over six days last
May and deliberated less than an hour before indicting Glaze on the
murder charges.

<HEAD>Seaga, Manley To Meet For Political Peace Parley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LLOYD WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga and
opposition leader Michael Manley plan to meet Monday to discuss
escalating political violence between the governing Jamaica Labor
Party and the People's National Party.
   The two rivals are to meet at the Wyndham Kingston Hotel at 5
p.m., shortly after their respective parties nominate the official
candidates for the Feb. 9 elections.
   The prime minister scheduled the meeting after Manley wrote him a
letter requesting they meet in light of the surge of political
violence within the past week.
   Basil Francis, 58, was killed and Merlina Wright, 49, and Norma
Richards, 39, were shot and wounded Friday during a clash between
rival political bands in Spanish Town, the police said.
   There also have been clashes reported between supporters of
Seaga's Labor party and Manley's People's National Party.
   In his letter, Manley said such confrontations constitute a
breach of an agreement reached in August 1988.
   ``We agreed, for example, that every effort should be made to
ensure that our respective supporters would not be mobilized to
harass, heckle, jeer and, in particular, provoke our opponents at
public meetings and on tours,'' Manley recalled.
   ``I am therefore suggesting that we meet together again very
urgently ... to review what has been taking place, and finalized
more precise methods of closer communication,'' Manley wrote.
   Seaga replied quickly in a letter suggesting that they and their
respective peace committees meet Monday to sign previously
negotiated peace agreements for the constituencies in the Kingston,
St. Andrew and St. Catherine parishes and then discuss the current
situation.
   ``I consider that these proposals would send the right signals
and the talks would be productive, based on the earlier discussions
during this week between the chairmen of the two parties,'' Seaga
said.
   Manley, in his letter, had said the recent incidents of violence
``have given me very great concern,'' and he wondered whether
``deliberate acts of provocation'' were being organized and staged
at the constituency level to discredit the Code of Conduct signed
between the two leaders in August.
   Justice James Kerr, the ombudsman for political matters, proposed
over the weekend that both parties ban political motorcades which,
he said, ``served no purpose other than providing a cover for the
devotees of strife and the promoters of violence to do their
destructive work.''
   Manley said that the People's National Party already has decided
not to hold anymore motorcades.
   However, he said he would tour individual constituencies almost
daily, and his parties' other candidates would be doing the same.
   What was important, he said, was that both sides already had
agreed to provide each other at the national and constituency levels
with their respective itineraries, a procedure which should be
implemented as a matter of routine from now on.
   Seaga wrote that ``several candidates of the Jamaica Labor Party
share my own concern that political violence is once again rearing
its ugly head'' and cited recent incidents in which Labor Party
supporters were attacked in St. Andrew parish.
   The prime minister also spoke of ``the near open warfare now
taking place in the main urban centers of St. Catherine,
particularly Spanish town and Old Harbor, which culminated with the
fire-bombing of the Old Harbor office of the JLP on Friday night.''

   Investigators said Sunday they have no
clues to the disappearance of former Prime Minister Paul Vanden
Boeynants and are increasingly worried about his safety.
   ``More than eight days after his abduction, we are more and more
frightened,'' said Prosecutor Andre Rutten. ``At the moment there is
no change whatsoever in the situation.''
   The previously unknown Socialist Revolutionary Brigade claimed it
abducted Vanden Boeynants only hours after his disappearance Jan. 14
and said at first he would be killed.
   On Tuesday, it demanded about $800,000 in ransom but police have
not heard from the group since, casting doubts whether it kidnapped
Vanden Boeynants.
   Rutten said Sunday a judicial dossier on the 69-year-old
Christian Democratic leader had vanished from the files but was it
was still unclear whether this was linked to his disappearance.
   Vanden Boeynants was given a three-year suspended jail sentence
in 1986 for tax fraud as head of his meatpacking business.
   The dossier has documentation on the relations between Vanden
Boeynants and two former police officials who have long been
investigated for a series of crimes.
   ``We have no elements that can make us think there is a relations
between the disappearance of Vanden Boeynants and the disappearance
of the dossier,'' Rutten said.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared on the evening of Jan. 14 after
parking his car near his home and police found indications he might
have been kidnapped.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and from
late 1978 to early 1979. He was also defense minister for seven
years during the 1970s.

<HEAD>Six City Councilors Detained in Construction Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested six members of Taipei's
City Council in connection with a bribery scandal involving the
construction of a $360 million shopping and entertainment complex,
officials said Sunday.
   The officials said District Court Prosecutor Tsai Hung-hsui
ordered the six detained after he investigated claims that they
received bribes to reverse a council decision against building the
complex at a private park in downtown Taipei.
   Under municipal regulations, the council must approve major
construction changes in public and private parks.
   Officials said construction magnate Huang Chou-hsuan reported his
Chiao Fu Construction Co. gave at least $580,000 in cash and gifts
to councilmen Chou Po-lun, 35, and Chen Chun-yuan, 34, in May to be
distributed among the councilors to influence their votes.
   A day after the payment, Chou, Chen and the other four councilors
reversed their earlier ``no'' votes and backed the construction
plan, which then was passed by the 48-member council, the officials
said.
   Officials identified the other councilors detained as Chou Chen
An-chun and Hsu Wen-lung of the governing Nationalist Party, and
Kang Shui-mu and Wang Kun-ho of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.
   Chen is a member of the Nationalist Party and Chou Po-lun belongs
to the Democratic Progressive Party. Officials said they would
pursue their investigation of Huang after he returns from a visit to
Hong Kong.
   All six councilors have denied accepting bribes but prosecutor
Tsai plans to file charges against them later this month, officials
said. All have been refused bail.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to death or life
imprisonment.

   Irish police said they found an Irish
Republican Army arms cache Sunday that included barrels, ammunition
and tripods for powerful Soviet-made machine guns capable of
shooting down helicopters.
   Police said the weapons and ammunition were found in a plastic
container buried underground at a deserted farm at Longfield in
County Monaghan, near the border with Northern Ireland.
   It was the fifth such discovery this year.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
latest find included a Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifle, more than 900
rounds of ammunition and ammunition boxes and belts.
   He said police also found six machine-gun barrels, tripods and
ammunition for Soviet-made 12.7 mm heavy machine guns. The IRA used
a similar heavy machine gun to shoot down a British Army helicopter
in South Armagh, Northern Ireland, in June.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to oust the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Three Hindus Hanged In Revenge For Executions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists dragged three Hindu men
from their homes and hanged them to avenge the executions of two
Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, police said Sunday.
   The Saturday night attack in the village of Ahema Khalan, 21
miles south of Amritsar, was the second such incident reported since
Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh were hanged in New Delhi on Jan. 6 for
Mrs. Gandhi's assassination.
   Senior police superintendent Suresh Arora said six or seven Sikhs
entered Gian Chand's home and took him and his brother, Madan Lal.
   Their uncle, Vir Bhan, was taken from a neighboring house, and
all three men were dragged to the village outskirts and hanged from
a tree, Arora said.
   He said a note left near the bodies said the killings were in
retaliation for the executions of Satwant Singh, who was convicted
of assassinating Mrs. Gandhi, and Kehar Singh, who was convicted of
conspiracy in the killing.
   The note bore the name of the Kalistan Commando Force, one of
several extermist groups waging a violent campaign for an
independent Sikh nation, Arora said.
   On Jan. 11, four Hindu brothers were hanged in Bhujiawali, 40
miles north of Amritsar. A note found near their bodies warned that
more people would be hanged because of the government executions.
   Sikh militants, who killed at least 2,440 people in northern
Punjab state last year, have killed more than 140 people so far this
year.
   The radicals have been fighting for a separate nation since 1982,
claiming members of their faith are discriminated against by India's
Hindu majority.
   Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's population of 880
million but form a majority in Punjab state. Hindus account for
about 80 percent of the national population.
   The Sikh faith has roots in both Hinduism and Islam.
   In London, meanwhile, about 4,000 Sikhs marched through the city
to protest the executions.
   Men, women and children gathered in Hyde Park before marching
along Oxford Street and Kingsway to Temple subway station near India
House, the office of the Indian high commmmissioner, or ambassador.
   A police cordon separated the marchers from the commission.
   Five Sikh elders carrying swords and scimitars led the
procession. Many marchers wore brightly colored turbans.
   On Sunday, medical student Dapinder Singh, one of the march
organizers, said: ``This procession is the first time that Sikhs
have come together under one banner. There are no more factions, we
are unified now and this is terrifying the Indian government.''
   About 400,000 Sikhs live in Britain.
   There was one brief scuffle between police and a marcher,
followed by a confrontation with more marchers, but an appeal for
calm by the march stewards defused the situation.

   The official radio said Information Minister Latif Nussayif
Jassim was asked by the ruling Revolution Command Council to permit
such complaints.
   The radio said that those under attack would be given a forum in
the same newspaper to respond.
   Iraq's four main state-run dailies previously did not publish
readers' letters.
   A similar council order last week permitted people to write
letters to the newspapers naming government officials who abuse
their authority or violate regulations.
   It said the officials also would be allowed to reply through the

   The moves appeared aimed at making government officials more

   President Bush, taking a pause from celebrative
inauguration events, attended a national worship service Sunday
where he was recognized as the ``symbol of unity.''
   The solemn interfaith ``National Prayer Service'' in the
sanctuary of the ornate Washington Cathedral served as a quiet,
contemplative climax to a frenetic five-day inauguration festival.
   While Bush worshipped with some 3,200 others, top aides appeared
on Sunday television interview shows to discuss the more secular
matters of budget deficits and U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The new president and first lady Barbara Bush kneeled and prayed
silently when they entered the cathedral, and then joined Vice
President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, in a front pew.
   Presiding over the service was the Rev. John T. Walker,
Episcopalian bishop of Washington, who noted that the Bushes,
Episcopalians themselves, had ``visited with us many times in the
past.'' He said he hoped to see them often, and the Bushes had said
previously that they intended to attend Sunday church services
regularly.
   Walker spoke of ``a nation united in the person of our president.
He is our symbol of unity.''
   The Rev. Peter Gomes, minister of Memorial Church at Harvard
University, who delivered the principal sermon, said, ``We have come
to pray for the reconcilation of the peoples of the nation.''
   Gomes worried aloud about ``the destitute of our American
Calcuttas'' and on behalf of ``the prisoners of the inner city
within a few short blocks of this cathedral and beyond.'' He also
urged compassion for the aged, for AIDS victims and for ``the
prisoners of affluence and indifference.''
   In this he took a page from Bush's inauguration address of
Friday, in which he said, ``My friends, we are not the sum of our
possessions. They are not a measure of our lives.''
   The Bushes and the other worshippers laughed when Gomes cited an
old adage, ``Be careful for what you pray, you might get it.''
   ``The former vice president of the United States prayed doubtless
to become president, and now he has. And now we must all pray with
him and for him,'' Gomes said.
   Bush's oldest son, George Walker Bush, 42, participated in the
service, reading a litany and ending it with, ``God protect our
mother and father.''
   Walker closed the service with the prayer that Bush himself had
used in his inaugural address on Friday: ``Use power to help people.
... There is but one use of power _ and it is to serve people.''
   The Bushes joined the rest of the congregation in singing songs
from the printed program, including ``Faith of Our Fathers,''
``Amazing Grace,'' and Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
   Bush, who surprised top aides and startled White House reporters
with several spur-of-the-moment appearances in public in recent
days, remained for the most part behind the scenes Sunday.
   He hosted an afternoon reception for members of the inauguration
committee and set aside the early evening to join his family in the
White House residence theater to watch the Super Bowl on wide-screen
television.
   After the game, Bush called National Football League Commissioner
Pete Rozelle and invited the victorious San Francisco 49ers to visit
the White House. No date was specified.
   Just before going to church, he appeared briefly on the South
Lawn, where he'd taken grandson George, 12, for a walk. ``It's a
great day,'' exclaimed Bush, who was wearing suitpants and a blue
wind-breaker.
   He seemed ready to relax after attending a series of inauguration
balls Friday, and two more parties on Saturday night. At a youth
rhythm-and-blues party, he got up on the stage and strummed a gift
guitar a few times.
   As Bush prepared for his first full week as president, his chief
of staff, former New Hampshire governor John Sununu, was describing
how Bush wants to consolidate the ``redirection'' of the country
that had begun during Ronald Reagan's eight-year presidency.
   Sununu, interviewed on CBS-TV's ``Face The Nation,'' said that
while Bush wanted to maintain economic prosperity and continue
Reagan's emphasis on a strong defense, he also planned to work hard
on such vexing problems as homelessness, drugs, child care and
education.
   He acknowledged that budget deficit problems would constrain the
chief executive, but said that in the days between now and Feb. 9,
when Bush plans to address a joint session, administration officials
want to emphasize ``our commitment to these issues.''
   Sununu said ``a conservative president can be compassionate.''
   But he refused to be tied down on whether Bush's no-tax pledge
would hold up for the next four years.
   ``I think what George Bush said to the American people was that
we will deal with the deficit, the fundamental issue, without
raising taxes,'' he said. ``We are putting a blueprint to deal with
the deficit that does not require taxes.''
   But when asked whether the Bush promise was intended to be good
for just one year, or four years, the chief of staff said the pledge
should be sound ``as long as the climate of this country is
appropriate for that commitment to stay in place.''

   Relatives of political prisoners jailed
by the leftist government demanded a general amnesty on Sunday and
protested forced labor in prison.
   The National Movement of Mothers and Relatives of Political
Prisoners marked the second anniversary of its founding by holding a
meeting in the capital, where leaders charged the Sandinista
government was denying family visits to political prisoners.
   ``The prisoners are being mistreated in jail and (the government)
has denied them family visits for refusing to work,'' said Matilde
Gutierrez, the group's president. She did not elaborate.
   She called for ``a total amnesty in the country'' for political
prisoners.
   Ms. Gutierrez told The Associated Press that 19 political
prisoners have been on a hunger strike since Jan. 15 in the National
Penitentiary System facility to protest the government's refusal to
permit visits.
   The facility, which houses former National Guardsmen who fought
under the late dictator Anastasio Somoza, is located about 14 miles
northeast of Managua.
   The Sandinistas toppled Somoza in the 1979 guerrilla war. Some of
the former guardsmen are serving prison terms of up to 30 years.
   An official with the Interior Ministry, which operates the
prison, denied that prisoners were fasting.
   ``There is no hunger strike among the prisoners,'' the official
said on condition of anonymity. He acknowledged that ``they refuse
to work, which is a disadvantage for them.'' The official declined
to elaborate.
   ``Normally, all of the prisoners who were closely linked with the
Somoza system don't work, they maintain a constant protest and are
in complete disagreement with the penitentiary system,'' the
official said.
   President Daniel Ortega said in December that there were 3,142
political prisoners, including former guardsmen and anti-Sandinista
rebels, in Nicaraguan jails.
   Ms. Gutierrez on Sunday disputed that figure.
   ``Throughout the country, there are more than 20,000 political
prisoners, and this affects in all some 30,000 children,'' she said.
   Ortega also said the government had released more than 1,300
prisoners in compliance with the Central American peace plan signed
by Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras in
1987.
   Also Sunday, Costa Rican security authorities said Sandinista
troops shot and killed a young Nicaraguan trying to cross into Costa
Rica.
   Luis Antonio Lopez Lopez, 17, died Friday night while trying to
get across the San Juan River in a tiny boat with 16 other young
Nicaraguans, said Carlos Jimenez, spokesman for the Costa Rican
Public Security Ministry.
   Costa Rican civil guardsmen reported that the Sandinista troops
opened fire from a hilltop, he said in a telephone interview.
   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry official on Sunday disputed the
report and said Nicaraguan troops exchanged gunfire with
anti-Sandinista guerrillas along the border.
   Costa Rica is home to more than 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees who
have fled the economic crisis and civil war in their homeland.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a dramatic finish, the San Francisco 49ers
football team won the Super Bowl on Sunday with a 20-16 victory over
the Cincinnati Bengals.
   Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34
seconds left provided the winning margin.
   The victory was achieved through the brilliance of Montana and
Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards,
both Super Bowl records. Rice was named the game's most valuable
player.
   The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, engineered
by Montana, whose touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with
357 yards passing.
   It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference
team, but by far the most dramatic _ the previous four had been by
an average score of 41-14.
   It also gave 49ers Coach Bill Walsh his third Super Bowl win.
   The game was a defensive struggle in the first half, which ended
in a 3-3 tie. Two key players were injured in the first 14 plays,
Cincinnati's All-Pro nose tackle Tim Krumrie and San Francisco's
tackle Steve Wallace.
   The first touchdown didn't come until 44 minutes into the
60-minute game, when Cincinnati's Stanford Jennings took a kickoff
93 yards for a score.
   The game, before a crowd of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium, went
undisrupted by racial tensions in Miami.

   Iranian authorities smashed a major drug
ring and killed six of its members Sunday, while a tough new
anti-narcotics law caused addicts and pushers to turn themselves in
and heroin prices to soar, reports said.
   In the last few days, Iran has executed 75 people and arrested
more than 1,000 people nationwide in what Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency termed ``the biggest crackdown on drug
smuggling in Iran's history.''
   Many addicts and pushers deserted their hideouts and turned
themselves in to avoid arrest, said the reports monitored in
Nicosia. The agency said 50 users were handed over to rehabilitation
centers but did not say what happened to the rest.
   Cafe owners previously tolerant of drug abusers on their premises
were turning them away since the new law calls for prosecuting
anyone who provides a refuge for them, the news agency said. Even
friends and relatives of addicts and pushers were alerting
authorities, it said.
   The anti-drug campaign caused heroin prices to jump four-fold
Sunday, a day after the new anti-drug law went into effect, the
Iranian news agency reported without giving any specific figures.
   In the northern Mazandaran province, three addicts committed
suicide by taking large heroin doses and then electrocuting
themselves, it said.
   The radio said the drug ring smashed Sunday was run by Habib
Naroui, who operated in southeastern Kerman and in
Sistan-Baluchistan.
   The broadcast said six members of his ring were killed in a raid
by agents of the Tehran and Kerman komiteh, the government's main
law enforcement agency. The report did not describe the
confrontation or say how the dealers died. It said 280 pounds of
opium were confiscated.
   In other raids Sunday, a man was arrested in the capital, Tehran,
with 22 pounds of heroin and 44 pounds of opium, the broadcast said.
Two other men were arrested in Kerman, it said.
   The report said an unspecified number of people in another gang
were arrested in the northern Semnan province and 145 pounds of
opium were seized.
   Two other drug smugglers were arrested who operated in the
capital and in central Isfahan province, the radio said. It said
without elaborating that a large sum of money and six vehicles were
confiscated from them.
   The new anti-narcotics law that went into effect Saturday
requires the death penalty for anyone convicted of possessing one
ounce of heroin, codeine or morphine, or smuggling more than 10
pounds of opium or hashish.

<DATELINE>LIMA, PERU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia says Occidental Petroleum
Corp. has discovered an estimated 600 million barrels of oil beneath
a jungle area.
   The oil was found in a region called La Colpa in the department
of Ucayali, 355 miles northeast of the capital, Garcia said Saturday
according to the official gazette El Peruano.
   According to engineers' projections the new discovery will
produce 600 million barrels and the total value of the oil,
according to current international prices, is about $10 billion,
Garcia told a news conference.
   Occidental began its exploration for the deposits two months ago
and in the last two weeks drilled to a depth of 8,000 feet, finding
high-quality crude, Garcia said.
   The president did not specify when Occidental, headquartered in
Los Angeles, will begin pumping the oil.

   A helicopter clipped power lines and

Reagan's ranch, killing the two people aboard, authorities said.
   The helicopter crashed at 10:40 a.m. in a area thick with brush
about eight miles from Reagan's Rancho del Cielo, said Deputy Don
Friedley of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. The
Reagans weren't at the ranch at the time.
   ``There are two people dead, but we don't know who they are,

Friedley said. Skies were clear.
   The crash site is 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   Power was knocked out temporarily to about 500 homes and
businesses when the helicopter snagged the high-voltage lines, said
a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co.

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion and pro-choice activists held rallies Sunday
marking the 16th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the
Roe vs. Wade case that legalized abortions.
   Thousands of abortion protesters marched in St. Paul, Minn.,
Little Rock, Ark., Allentown, Pa., Boston, Bismarck, N.D., and
Burlington, Vt., while large pro-choice rallies were held in
Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   In Little Rock, Asa Hutchinson, a lawyer and former federal
prosecutor, told a crowd of several thousand people that the ``tide
is changing'' toward reversal of Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Change in direction is brought about by citizens at the
grassroots level,'' Hutchinson said.
   An estimated 4,500 abortion protesters marched in St. Paul to the
statehouse. There were no arrests.
   In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 banner-carrying marchers
joined the March For Women's Lives. They were met at the Allegheny
County morgue by about 40 anti-abortion marchers.
   The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which Eleanor
Smeal, a former National Organization for Women president, said,
``Some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood of
innocent women. That isn't Christianity. It's hypocrisy. The church
has no business dictating the policies of this country.''
   After her remarks, many in the crowd turned, shook their fingers
and yelled, ``Shame, shame, shame'' at the anti-abortion protesters,
who stood across the street.
   About 500 women attending a Feminist Super Bowl Rally for Choice
in Los Angeles vowed to continue supporting a woman's right to
abortion. And in Seattle, about 500 pro-choice demonstrators
attended a candlelight rally in front of the federal courthouse.
   In Philadelphia, about 30 pro-choice demonstrators held a
candlelight vigil Sunday night in front of Independence Hall, where
the U.S. Constitution was signed.
   Organizers said the vigil emphasized that the freedom to have a
legal abortion may be in jeopardy because of the Supreme Court's
decision to review a Missouri law that declares life begins at
conception.
   Sue Elentrio, a board member of the Philadelphia chapter of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, said the small turnout was
reflective of the timing of the vigil, not concern over the issue.
   ``They're (women) all home making snacks for their husbands
because it's Super Bowl Sunday,'' she said.
   In San Francisco, about 200 pro-choice protesters chanted during
a march, ``No back alleys in the night, for safe abortion we will
fight.''
   Several pro-choice groups and abortion protesters came
face-to-face.
   At the offices of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England in
Burlington, Vt., more than 500 opponents of abortion were met by 40
pro-choice demonstrators.
   The two sides faced each other from across the street, with each
group singing, clapping and maintaining their distance. There were
no arrests.
   ``Right-to-life is not a political issue,'' said Bishop John
Marshall, the leader of Vermont's Catholic diocese. ``It has nothing
to do with politics. It is a religious and moral question. It is not
a matter for the politicians to decide. It is a religious and moral
issue already decided by God.''
   More than 500 people crowded Boston's Faneuil Hall to hear
Cardinal Bernard Law lead a rally against abortion. Mayor Raymond L.
Flynn read a proclamation declaring Sunday ``Respect for Life Day''
in Boston.
   Outside Faneuil Hall, a small group of pro-choice protesters
chanting and carrying signs led by longtime pro-abortion activist
Bill Baird picketed the building.
   ``I warn you now we are in danger of losing the abortion law,''
Baird said.
   Washington state pro-choice activists, who plan to collect 10,000
signatures in support of abortion rights, urged people to get
involved.
   ``The right to choose is under severe attack from the Bush
administration, the change in the Supreme Court and from anti-choice
extremists. Now more than ever the pro-choice majority has to show
itself,'' said Esther Herst, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League in Washington
   Thousands of people were expected in Washington, D.C., on Monday
for a protest organized by March for Life. Leonard Dinegar of the
National Right to Life Committee said organizers hope to match last
year's turnout, when police estimated that 50,000 people marched.
   President Bush is scheduled to speak by telephone to the march.

   Solidarity on Sunday welcomed the
government's offer to negotiate legalizing the outlawed trade union
and said talks should begin as soon as possible to combat Poland's
chronic economic and social ills.
   A Solidarity statement, released after a nearly two-day meeting,
clears the way for the first formal talks between Solidarity and
authorities since a December 1981 military crackdown crushed the
organization.
   But Solidarity leader Lech Walesa cautioned, ``I wish that there

   President Bush, taking a pause from celebrative

where he was recognized as the ``symbol of unity.''
   The solemn interfaith ``National Prayer Service'' in the
sanctuary of the ornate Washington Cathedral served as a quiet,
contemplative climax to a frenetic five-day inauguration festival.
   While Bush worshipped with some 3,200 others, top aides appeared
on Sunday television interview shows to discuss the more secular

   The new president and first lady Barbara Bush kneeled and prayed
silently when they entered the cathedral, and then joined Vice

   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,

where they worshiped before entering the White House.
   ``God ... has answered our prayers for you and for Mrs. Reagan
and I want you to know we are very pleased to welcome you back, and
thank God for what you were able to do for your country in these
last eight years,'' the Rev. Donn Moomaw of Bel Air Presbyterian

   The congregation, disregarding a precautionary note in the church

   ``We came here with an honorable task, with open hearts ... We

   ``It isn't worth the trouble to reply to these proposals, which
have been rejected even by Palestinian children,'' Arafat told a

   The Palestine Liberation Organization chief was in Baghdad for a

   The federal government paid the equivalent of
13 percent of Mexico's gross national product in interest alone on
its internal debt in 1988, according to a report by the private
Market Investigation Bureau.
   In contrast, the government paid little more than the equivalent
of 6 percent of GNP to service its $106 billion foreign debt last
year, the bureau said.
   It called for prompt action to reduce the internal debt, the
Excelsior news agency reported.
   Mexico's GNP is estimated at $160 billion; estimated servicing of
the domestic debt last year totaled $20 billion, while foreign debt
payments reached around $9 billion.
   Economists blame heavy government borrowing to service the
domestic debt as a major cause of inflation, which reached 51.7
percent last year.

<HEAD>Blow-Out Said to Be Averted in Norwegian North Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAVANGER, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts said Sunday a blow-out in the
Norwegian section of the North Sea had been averted after a critical
natural gas leak Friday, Norway's national news agency NTB reported.
   Saga Petroleum Co. had maintained a high alert through the
weekend after the gas leak Friday afternoon, when a hose connecting
the drilling rig Treasure Saga with a blow-out preventor on the
seabed broke. There were no injuries.
   The rig was drilling a well in the Albuskjell gas field in the
Ekofisk oil and natural gas area in the southernmost part of
Norway's North Sea section.
   Saga spokesman Bjoern Glenne said drilling was suspended ``and
the blow-out preventor on the seabed quickly closed'' after the leak.
   ``The well pressure is high but stable. The situation is under
control,'' NTB quoted him as saying.
   Boots Hansen, an American blow-out expert called in by Saga, told
a news conference Sunday that the danger appeared to be over.
   ``As long as the (blow-out preventor) has withstood the pressure
since Friday, it should continue to do so. Similar things have
happened other places in the world,'' NTB quoted him as saying.
   Hansen came to Stavanger, 181 miles southeast of the Norwegian
capital Oslo, on Saturday to assist Saga's own security team in
finding ways to reduce the well pressure and strengthen the blow-out
preventor.
   On Saturday morning, Treasure Saga had been towed 500 feet away
from the well site. Only 28 of the 75 rig workers remained onboard.
   NTB quoted Saga Security Chief Aksel Arnecke as saying a new hose
was underway to replace the one which broke Friday and that a first
attempt to strengthen the blow-out preventor will take place within
a few days.
   Other alternatives include pumping more heavy drilling mud into
the well to reduce pressure on the blow-out preventor, or eventually
engaging another rig to drill a second well to relieve the pressure
_ an operation which could take several months.

<TEXT>
   The machinists at The New York Times voted Sunday
to ratify an agreement on a 6-year extension of a labor contract
that expired nearly two years ago, a union official said.
   The pact, retroactive to April 1987, calls for $233.35 weekly in
additional wages and benefits for each worker over six years and
contains language for better job security for the 72 machinists,
said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, an umbrella group that includes 10 of the 14 unions at the
Times.
   Members of the Eureka Lodge 434 of the International Association
of Machinists voted overwhelmingly to approve the contract,
according to McDonald. However, the exact vote tally and details of
the agreement were not available Sunday, he said.
   ``It's a good contract. I'm delighted that the machinists settled
with The New York Times,'' McDonald said.
   Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said, ``The Times is pleased the
machinists union reached an agreement. This is the last of our
unions to sign a 6-year agreement.''
   Negotiators reached their agreement Thursday, just hours before a
strike deadline.
   The union membership had rejected an earlier tentative settlement
on Jan. 8 and authorized a strike at 12:01 a.m. EST last Friday,
unless a new deal was reached.
   The machinists, who maintain and repair presses and other
equipment, were the last of 14 unions to reach pacts with the Times
covering wages, benefits and job security through March 1993.
   Their contract expired March 31, 1987.
   The contract agreements for the unions are similar, but issues of
job security were different for various unions, and some are to be
subject to further negotiations or arbitration.

<TEXT>
   A supermarket chain recalled certain
packages of a store-brand ice cream Saturday because of possible
exposure to ammonia gas during manufacture, a spokesman said.
   Stater Brothers Markets recalled its brand of square-pack,
half-gallon packages of ice cream in golden vanilla and chocolate
flavors bearing the code 092289, said spokesman Tom Reingrover.
   ``It's strictly a precautionary thing,'' he said. ``The recall is
on all of that code, however we found very little product affected.''
   The packages did not necessarily end up in all of Stater
Brothers' 101 markets in Southern California but there was no way to
determine which stores actually received the lot, Reingrover said.
   The code is printed on an end flap of the packages. Some of the
ice cream in those packages may be discolored, have an off-flavor
and ammonia odor.
   The ice cream was made for Stater Brothers Markets by Knudsen Co.
but no Knudsen products or other brands were affected, Stater
Brothers said.
   Reingrover said he did not know how many packages were in the
recalled lot.
   Consumers were advised to return the ice cream to the store where
they bought it to receive a refund.
   The ice cream was manufactured in late December and was in the
stores for ``a very short period of time,'' Reingrover said. He did
not know exactly when it was put into the stores.
   The contamination occurred because of a leak of ammonia gas from
the system that freezes the ice cream during the manufacturing
process, he said.

<HEAD>West Coast Video, Based Far From Hollywood, Is World's Largest Video

<TEXT>
   You can't get much farther from the West
Coast than northeast Philadelphia.
   But underneath the image of a blazing sun on a bright red sign,
Elliot Stone opened the first West Coast Video stores in the
second-largest city on the East Coast.
   After five years, scores of franchise contracts and the buyout of
struggling Portland, Ore.-based National Video Inc.'s franchise
operations, West Coast Video has grown into the largest video rental
outlet in the world. ``Even from the start, our name had given the
impression that we were a nationally-franchised company,'' said
Stone, the chain's founder and chief executive officer. ``We wanted
a Hollywood image _ flashing lights, tons of glitter.''
   Laden with bright-red carpeting and wallpaper, tracer lights and,
of course, movie posters, the West Coast Video stores have brought a
franchise formula to what started as family-owned operations with
little commitment toward growing nationally.
   ``It's gone big-time now'' and gone beyond the level of stores
that were opened as a hobby, said Steven Apple, executive editor of
Video Insider, a trade magazine.
   ``Every day, mom-and-pop stores are closing. Our stores are
replacing the mom-and-pop operations,'' Stone said.
   Sitting behind his U-shaped desk in his overwhelmingly blue
office _ nearly devoid of red _ Stone is a successful entrepreneur,
but not altogether satisfied.
   Plans for 1989 are to increase growth from three franchises a
week and one company store every 10 days to opening a new outlet
every working day.
   Last year, after the acquisition of National Video for about $3
million in cash and the addition of 455 franchised outlets, West
Coast had $180 million in revenue, according to Sarah Killion,
company spokeswoman. That was up sharply from 1986 revenue of $11
million.
   In its December 1988 issue, Inc. magazine listed West Coast Video
as the fourth-fastest growing privately-owned company in the
country, with sales jumping 22,653 percent between 1983 and 1987.
   As of Jan. 11, there were 650 stores, 455 of which came from
National Video, 195 West Coast Video franchises and 68 company-owned
stores.
   Stone said the company has gone through periods when it grew too
fast for the staff and equipment. But he is confident that with VCRs
in 55 percent of U.S. homes, the rental industry will continue to
grow for another five to 10 years.
   Competition for West Coast, however, may come from convenience
and grocery store chains that set aside a rack or corner for movie
rentals. Such stores can offer movie rentals at a lower rate because
they don't depend on rentals for their income. Also, convenience
stores like 7-Eleven already have stores on street corners across
the country.
   But according to Apple, people prefer to go to a store
specializing in videos by a margin of three to one. He said
customers are attracted by the selection and service provided by a
video store.
   ``I see it very much as an industry that will continue to be
dominated by video specialty stores with growing business in
convenience stores,'' said Stephen Wilson, chairman of Fairfield
Group Inc., a market research firm specializing in the video
business.
   Stone started West Coast Video in September 1983 after he and his
wife couldn't find the movie they were looking for and thought the
clerks were rude.
   ``We saw all these people walking into a retail outlet for one
sole purpose _ to rent a movie,'' Stone said. ``Here they're already
in the store and not coming out with a movie.''
   Several years ago, most video stores kept the tapes behind a
counter and the customer was expected to walk up with a list of
movies and ask the clerk which ones were in stock.
   Stone takes credit for introducing a new system, emulated by
many, that displays an empty box for each copy of a movie in stock.
When the customer picks up the box, he is assured of being able to
rent the movie.
   Many stores will give a customer a free day's rental if the movie
for a displayed box is not in stock.
   Occasionally, with franchisees who have taken a second mortgage
on their house or invested their life savings in the store, it is
difficult to convince them that giving away $2 worth of rentals will
pay off if the customer comes back.
   At $35,000, West Coast Video's franchise fee is $6,000 higher
than any other video franchiser, according to the Franchise
Handbook, published by Enterprise Magazines Inc. of Milwaukee, Wisc.
Between $175,000 and $250,000 in capital is required to start a West
Coast Video store.

<HEAD>Suburban Pilots Reject Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>READING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots for Suburban Airlines, a regional
commuter service based in Reading, moved a step closer to a strike
when they rejected the company's latest contract offer.
   Bill Welch, a spokesman for Council 78 of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said union pilots voted almost unanimously against
ratifying a contract proposal offered by the airline. He declined to
say how many ballots were cast, but said 97 percent were against
ratification.
   ``We either go back into mediation or we could go on strike
within 30 to 60 days,'' Welch said Saturday night after the ballots
were counted in the Holiday Inn.
   Suburban, a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAir Group Inc., flies to
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Washington and several other Eastern
cities. It services the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Airport as well
as Reading and Lancaster, all in Pennsylvania.
   The Reading-based Council 78, which is the bargaining agent for
90 pilots, has been negotiating with Suburban for 15 months. A
federal mediator was brought into the talks about five months ago.
   John Mazor, a spokesman in Washington, D.C., for the Air Line
Pilots Association, said the mediator would have to determine that a
stalemate exists and both sides would have to refuse to enter
arbitration before the pilots could strike.
   Welch declined to discuss the details of Suburban's offer, but
indicated that wages and scheduling were among the major obstacles.
   Under the existing contract, Welch said, a newly hired co-pilot
would start at $1,050 a month and a first-year captain earns $1,920
a month. The wages, he said, are based on 80 hours of flying time a
month.

<HEAD>Survey Rates Campbell Nation's Most Innovative Company</HEAD>

   When it comes to innovation in marketing
and product development, Campbell Soup Co. lives up to its slogan
``Mm! Mm! Good,'' according to a survey of senior corporate
executives who said too many other U.S. corporations lack
imagination.
   In its fourth annual ``Innovation Survey,'' Group EFO Ltd. found
that 34 percent of those responding rated Campbell the most
innovative corporation in the United States, followed by Pillsbury
Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Hormel &amp; Co. and the General Foods
division of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
   ``Campbell has gone against the tide in a lot of ways,'' Edward
F. Ogiba, president of Group EFO, said Friday. His consulting firm,
which specializes in consumer attitudes toward new products, is
based in Norwalk, Conn.
   ``They are a big company that is acting like a small company,''
Ogiba said. ``They've been willing to take risks and they've been
willing to look at quite a wide variety of offerings to find out
what the consumer really wants.''
   The survey, released last week, was based on responses from 75
chief executives, corporate presidents, and directors of marketing,
planning and development at some of the world's largest consumer
goods companies, Ogiba said. It was co-sponsored by Food and
Beverage Marketing magazine.
   Ogiba noted that Camden, N.J.-based Campbell has introduced a
string of hugely successful new product lines over the last several
years, including the upscale ``Le Menu'' frozen dinners, Prego
spaghetti sauce, Pepperidge Farm American Collection cookies and
Campbell's Home Cookin' soups.
   The survey found what Ogiba calls an alarming lack of confidence
in the way new products are developed.
   Eighty percent of those responding predicted that 83 percent of
all new products introduced this year will fail and 33 percent said
consumer research was unreliable.
   Sixty-two percent believe that products introduced this year will
prove the same or less innovative than last year. Fifty-five percent
felt product development lacked direction.
   Ogiba said his survey indicated that marketing executives have
become mesmerized by the idea of convenience _ foods that can be
stored easily or quickly prepared _ as the key selling point in
developing new product lines or in coming out with new versions of
products already on the market.
   Companies like Campbell, on the other hand, have gone to great
lengths to explore other characteristics that will appeal to
consumers, Ogiba said.
   Fifty-one percent of those surveyed named Japan as the most
innovative country in the world, followed by the United States, West
Germany and Britain.
   ``The models of innovation are outside the company for most
marketers today,'' Ogiba said. ``In some ways, managers are saying
that their internally driven new product process isn't working and
that a better, more successful approach lies elsewhere.''

<HEAD>Zambia Resumes Ties with IMF</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda said his Southern
African nation accepted an offer by the International Monetary Fund
to resume an economic restructuring program in Zambia.
   In the text of an interview with U.S. reporters issued Sunday,
Kaunda said an accord with the IMF followed what he described as the
fund's ``flexible stance toward needy countries''.
   Speaking with Jane Perlez of The New York Times and Richard
Bonner of New Yorker magazine, Kaunda said the IMF will assist with
homespun economic reforms adopted by his government since he severed
ties with the fund in May 1987.
   ``They made soundings that they want to come back and we said:
`Yes, we are ready,''' Kaunda told the reporters. ``This should be
on our own terms and they (the IMF) should only come here to help us
do what we are already doing,'' he said.
   Several senior officials of the IMF and the World Bank visited
Zambia in recent months to negotiate resumed loan assistance.
   Last year, the Zambian government cut state subsidies on some
essential commodities and removed price controls on some items to
prepare the way for a rapprochement with the IMF.
   When Zambia cut its ties with the IMF in 1987 the government said
the fund's economic austerity program was too harsh.
   That program called for a massive devaluation of the Zambian
currency and the removal of subsidies on essential goods and corn
meal, the staple food.
   Government troops shot dead 15 civilians in food riots in late
1986 after the government slashed its subsidy on corn meal in line
with IMF demands.

<HEAD>Peruvian President Announces Major Oil Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peruvian President Alan Garcia announced a
major oil discovery by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in a jungle area
in Peru.
   The oil deposits, estimated at 600 million barrels, were
discovered in a jungle region called La Collpa in Ucayali, 355 miles
northeast of Lima, Garcia told a news conference Friday, according
to the official gazette El Peruano.
   According to the president's figures, the new deposits will yield
enough oil to make Peru a net oil exporter, and secure enough oil,
energy, fuel and cash to meet the country's development needs for
the next 15 years.
   The total value of the oil at current world prices is $10
billion, Garcia was quoted as saying.
   Occidental began its exploration in the region two months ago,
Garcia said. He did not say when Occidental will begin to pump the
oil.
   Officials of Los Angeles-based Occidental were unavailable for
comment Sunday.

<HEAD>Owner of Mexican Candy Company Denies LSD Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of the candy company Dulces Anahuac
SA denied allegations that LSD-laced decals were distributed in its
candy packages, the government news agency Notimex reported.
   Ricardo Menendez said laboratory analysis conducted by the
federal Health Department and Attorney General's Office failed to
turn up any foreign substance on the decals, Notimex said.
   Last Friday, the National Association of Private Schools said it
had asked the government to investigate the source of LSD on the
decals, which transfer a tattoo-like cartoon onto the skin.
   The decals bear the words ``Made in Spain'' in English and say in
Spanish they were manufactured for Dulces Anahuac SA. Designed to
appeal to young buyers, the decals began showing up recently in the
Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec, Association President Alfredo Villar
said Friday.
   Villar said chemical tests revealed the decals contained several
hallucinogenic substances, including LSD, that can be absorbed
through the skin.
