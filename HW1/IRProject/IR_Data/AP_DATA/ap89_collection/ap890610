<HEAD>Talk Show Hosts Say They're Ignored Despite Their Influence</HEAD>

   Radio talk show hosts proved they're a force to be
reckoned with during the congressional pay-raise brouhaha, deluging
Capitol Hill with millions of tea bags from angry listeners. But
they still feel ignored.
   So they're meeting in Boston this weekend to do what other
aggrieved minorities do: unite to demand more power.
   ``In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, `We don't get no
respect,''' said organizer Jerry Williams of Boston radio station
WRKO. ``The national media ... never took us very seriously. They
think there's some conspiracy here.''
   About 50 of the country's 225 radio talk show hosts began
arriving Friday for the inaugural TalkRadio Conference, a two-day
gab confab expected to include consumer activist Ralph Nader, TV
talk show host Morton Downey Jr. and political columnist Jack
Anderson.
   Williams, a 65-year-old talk jockey who's been in the business
since 1950, said he hoped the gathering would give visibility to a
national movement that has given ordinary people a chance to be
heard.
   ``There's a huge void where people feel they don't have a voice
anymore,'' he said.
   The voices at the conference are deep and smooth. The smiles are
big. The words are vehement and well-rehearsed.
   ``There is no more representative government in this country
anymore. It's all special interests,'' said Mills Crenshaw of
WTKK-AM in Salt Lake City. ``The reason politicians are afraid of
talk radio is we have the ability to allow private citizens to talk
to their government.''
   Williams took the first step toward unifying the talk show hosts
in February, when he was able to persuade his colleagues to lead a
national protest against proposed federal pay increases.
   Coaxed by their local hosts, listeners sent their congressmen a
ton of tea bags bearing the message: ``Read my tea bag: no 50
percent raise.''
   The public pressure helped halt a raise for lawmakers, judges and
other people on the federal payroll.
   Williams said he was encouraged by the cooperation of his on-air
brethren to try to formalize their connections through a conference.
   The session got going Friday with an open mike to Boston area
listeners. Today, the talk show hosts planned to talk to each other,
exchanging ideas and formally organizing, Williams said.
   Faneuil Hall, the venerable brick building where revolutionaries
fomented independence from Britain and abolitionists railed against
slavery, served as the stage for Friday's events.
   In the morning, WRKO host Gene Burns leaned into one of the
microphones and said, ``The people are sovereign, not the
government,'' adding:
   ``Our elected representatives try ... to give Americans enough
fat from the hog to keep people from rising up.''
   His peers from across the country and about 125 listeners from
around New England took their seats. And in person, the talk show
fans were as vociferous as their radio friends.
   ``I like to hear what the people say and not the politicians. We
have a governor here who's a dictator,'' said Z. Peter Czapski, 67,
of North Andover, his face turning red.
   ``You've got me going,'' the retired tool and die plant manager
said happily.
   Janet Wofsey, 36, of Quincy, who works for a department store,
said she's a frequent listener and talker.
   ``It's the satisfaction of voicing my opinion, to express it over
the airwaves. With letter writing, there's no response,'' she said.
``You can get a response from the talk show.''

   A woman described as the godmother of a gang
of drug-smuggling ritual killers says she is innocent of any
wrongdoing, including 15 slayings at a ranch near Matamoros.
   But Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 24, of Matamoros, also said Friday
she expects to be indicted on murder charges. She scoffed at the
claim by investigators that she was the ``madrina,'' or godmother,
of the gang.
   Ms. Aldrete and Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, 23, of Mexico City,
were interviewed by The Associated Press at the Eastern
Penitentiary. They have been held there since the May 6 shootout
with police in which cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his
associate, Martin Quintana Rodriguez, were killed.
   Orea Ochoa, Ms. Aldrete and gang member Alvaro de Leon Valdez
were arraigned in the Matamoros slayings earlier this week in the
9th Federal Criminal Court in Mexico City and were awaiting other
indictments.
   They were indicted last month on various charges in connection
with Constanzo's death in a Mexico City apartment and pleaded
innocent.
   Ms. Aldrete and Orea Ochoa also said they were innocent of the
Matarmoros killings and when they were captured May 6 they were
fleeing, against their will, with Constanzo.
   ``He threatened me,'' said Orea Ochoa of Constanzo.
   Ms. Aldrete said the man who forced her to accompany him was a
different man from the charming fortune-teller she'd met a year and
a half earlier.
   ``I thought I knew him, but I didn't,'' she said.
   Constanzo made her go with him when he fled Matamoros for Mexico
City because he feared she would go to police, she added.
   Ms. Aldrete said Constanzo hit her and threatened her with a
submachine gun.
   Constanzo, Quintana Rodriguez, Orea Ochoa and Ms. Aldrete left
Matamoros after authorities began digging up mutilated bodies April
9 at the Santa Elena ranch.
   Among the victims was Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of
Texas student.
   Authorities said Kilroy and several other victims were sacrificed
in rituals to provide magical protection for the gang's
drug-trafficking business.
   Seven people in Matamoros, including two fugitives, were charged
last month in the slayings.
   Both Orea Ochoa and Ms. Aldrete said they knew nothing of the
Matamoros killings until they saw news reports. Orea Ochoa said he
had never been to the ranch, and Ms. Aldrete said she was there only
once for a birthday party.
   Ms. Aldrete, a former honor student at Texas Southernmost College
in Brownsville, said she spends her time in solitary confinement
reading.
   ``If I knew I did something, I could say I was paying for it, but
I didn't,'' she said.
   Orea Ochoa said he tries not to think about what will happen to
him.
   ``The future is very black,'' he said. ``Something completely
different from what I wanted.''

<HEAD>Gunman Surrenders After Releasing Hostages at Old Faithful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman who surrendered
to park rangers after releasing eight hostages from a visitors'
center will undergo a psychiatric examination, authorities said.
   The man, identified as Brett Hartley of Baton Rouge, La., was
taken into custody Friday night and transported to Jackson, Wyo.,
where he will be tested.
   ``He is a frustrated guy who has had a hard life,'' said park
ranger Joe Evans, noting that Hartley once suffered from cancer.
``He was relatively calm the whole time.''
   The hostage-taking ``was an expression of asking for help. Some
people have a hard time asking for help,'' Evans said.
   Park spokesman Shelton Johnson said Hartley, 18, walked into the
center at Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful geyser complex
shortly after 3 p.m. Friday, brandished a Ruger .30-caliber revolver
and told everyone inside to lie down.
   Women and children who were visiting were released a few minutes
later, but Hartley held eight hostages about three hours, Johnson
said. The hostages included five male visitors and three park
employees, two of whom were women.
   Gary Painter, 34, of West Jordan, Utah, one of the hostages held
for three hours, said the center was silent inside except for the
sound of Hartley talking on the telephone with park rangers.
   ``I was just lying there on the floor watching him,'' Painter
said. ``I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen. He
didn't say a word (to us). He never said anything about why. He was
real calm.''
   Suddenly, at 6 p.m., Hartley yelled an obscenity into the
telephone and told everyone to leave, Painter said. The hostages ran
out the door.
   No one was injured and no shots were fired, park authorities said.
   Park ranger Bundy Phillips said he conducted the telephone
negotiations for nearly five hours with Hartley, who had a gun
trained on the hostages throughout much of the period.
   Phillips said Hartley told him he planned the incident, and that
``it was a choice between the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.''
   Evans said Hartley put the gun down about 8 p.m. and walked
outside the center, where he was met by three park rangers in a car.
After a short conversation, he was handcuffed and placed in the car,
Evans said.
   President Bush and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan are scheduled
to visit Yellowstone on Monday to inspect damage from last summer's
forest fires. The center is not in an area the president planned to
visit.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Labor Department Orders End to Gift Concern's Home Labor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman struggling to keep her $1.7
million gift business alive says the state's enforcement of a law
banning sewing work at home is unfair and has cost nearly 100 women
their jobs.
   The state Department of Labor and Industry has ordered
Overly-Raker Inc. to stop using 100 or more homeworkers to piece
together ``soft sculptures'' _ geese, cows, cats and other creations
stuffed in cloth skins.
   Helen Overly, the company's president, said she was unaware of
the 1937 Industrial Homework Act and made no effort to hide the
company's use of women sewing at home. The law prohibits anyone
other than handicapped or those providing primary care for a
handicapped family member from doing industrial work at home.
   Overly, a former teacher, founded the company in her basement 16
years ago with Freda Raker, a former secretary who handles the
business' creative end.
   Since the Bureau of Labor Standards ordered the company to stop
home production May 11 in response to a complaint, Overly said she
began to hire the 30 or more seamstresses needed at a plant in a
former dairy distribution building in southern Pennsylvania's rural
Fulton County.
   ``The biggest hassle now is to find people who will come in,''
she said.
   Most of the women who had worked at home will lose their jobs
because they have small children or cannot get to the plant, she
said. ``There's a lot of hardship going on because of this.''
   One worker, Virginia Logsdon, said the $250 a month she earned
supplemented her husband's income. She said she worked for almost
two years, usually earning about $4 an hour based on the piece rate
paid by Overly-Raker.
   ``It was very important. It takes what my husband makes to meet
the expenses,'' she said. ``My money would take care of clothes, the
dentist, medicines.''
   Logsdon said she can't leave her 11-year-old daughter, Colletta,
and 12-year-old son, Danny, to drive the more than 100 miles between
her home in rural Armstrong County to the new Overly-Raker plant.
   Helen R. Friedman, director of the labor standards bureau, said
the state was determined to enforce labor laws. ``We work to protect
people's rights,'' she said.
   John Fox, an international vice president for the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers, said homework provides an opportunity
for companies to exploit workers.
   ``There is no control. There is no such thing as overtime. Their
children help them. Before you know it, children under 12 have
become helpers,'' Fox said. ``It becomes substandard conditions.''
   During a recent interview, Overly said the company had more than
400 orders for more than 8,000 pieces of merchandise as it prepares
for the Halloween to Christmas holiday season.
   She had hired only five full-time seamstresses and was worried
about higher labor costs when the threat from low-cost imports from
Haiti, the Philippines and Taiwan is growing. Still, she said the
company would survive.

<HEAD>U.S. Jews Being Asked to Finance Freedom of Their Soviet Brethren</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, U.S. Jews have set aside a special
matzo each Passover and prayed for the emigration of their brethren
in the Soviet Union.
   Now that those prayers have been answered for many, Jews in the
United States are being asked to set aside something more than
unleavened bread _ the money required to resettle as many as 50,000
Jews who are expected to leave the Soviet Union this year.
   The United Jewish Appeal, the national fund-raising campaign for
Jewish causes in the United States and Israel, has launched Passage
to Freedom, an effort aimed at raising $75 million for Soviet
emigres this year.
   Half will go to resettlement activities in the United States. The
rest will be split between Soviet Jews in transit to the United
States, and those seeking to settle in Israel.
   ``We have worked for years and years to free them from Russia.
Now that they are free, we can't deny them the freedom to choose
where they are going to live,'' said Ron Reider, director of public
affairs for the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles.
   ``We really don't know how long these doors will be open,'' said
Marvin Lender, who is leading the national effort. ``We're looking
at the third largest Jewish community in the world, and here's an
opportunity to save them.''
   The campaign, launched in April, already has raised more than $21
million.
   Peggy Tishman, president of New York's UJA-Federation of Jewish
Philanthropies, said one reason for the success is that many
American Jews feel they did too little to save European Jews from
Hitler.
   ``The idea of not losing another Jewish soul is all-pervasive,''
she said.
   Programs to help Soviet Jews have been taxed to the breaking
point by the flood of emigres, especially in New York City, the
destination for more than half of the new arrivals.
   The New York Association for New Americans, the biggest private
resettlement agency that gets about two-thirds of its money from the
UJA, has had to spread its staff among three offices to make room
for more caseworkers.
   The association is operating as many as 70 English classes a day
for immigrants. It also helps new arrivals find jobs and housing.
   New York's UJA-Federation has taken a $100,000 advance from its
Passage to Freedom money to finance scholarships to Jewish day camps
so youngsters can adjust to life in the United States while their
parents learn English, get jobs and find places to live.
   Appeal money in other cities also will go to programs with proven
track records.
   ``In four to five months, we can make them tax-paying members of
the community,'' said Reider.
   About 18,000 Soviets, mostly Jewish, left the Soviet Union in the
first five months of this year and another 26,000 applicants are
waiting to be interviewed at the U.S. Embassy.
   With only about 10 percent of the Soviet Jewish emigres choosing
to go to Israel, some Zionists complain that too much money is going
to U.S. resettlement programs.
   ``Given the choice, I'd rather see much more of the Passage to
Freedom money go to Israel,'' said Lynne Abramson, president of New
York's Long Island Committee for Soviet Jewry.
   Still, she said she has given to the appeal.
   ``I feel that we need very much to help them when they are
here,'' Ms. Abramson said.

   Taiwan's military chief has urged troops in
China to support the democracy movement and end their crackdown on
demonstrators campaigning for freedom, a television station reported.
   ``We hope the mainland troops, especially the younger ones, will
join the people to fight for freedom and democracy,'' Gen. Hau
Pei-tsun, chief of the armed forces, said Friday night in a rare
interview with the state China Television Co.
   ``We urge troops on the mainland not to become accomplices to the
suppression of democracy,'' Hau said. ``Mainland troops should play
the leading role in establishing a new China under democracy.''
   Hau spoke five days after Chinese troops swept through Beijing's
Tiananman Square, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, to suppress
the pro-democracy uprising that began in mid-April.
   Hardliners in the Chinese leadership appear to have won a power
struggle there, and reports from Beijing say troops now are
arresting supporters of the democracy movement.
   The Nationalists, defeated on the mainland in a civil war in
1949, are technically still at war with the Communists. They
continue to claim they are China's legitimate rulers.
   Hau, 69, born on the mainland and trained in the United States,
heads Taiwan's 500,000-man armed forces.
   Hau said the uprising suggests economic reforms initiated by
senior leader Deng Xiaoping have failed.
   Hau said he now expects a lengthy purge of opponents of China's
hardline leaders.

<HEAD>Report: Hong Kong Preparing to Offer Asylum to Chinese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong is preparing to offer asylum to political
refugees from China, London's Guardian newspaper reported today.
   Quoting the British colony's secretary for security, the paper
said trained personnel and screening procedures have already been
set up at the border with China's Guandong province, ``even though
it is recognized that this move will add to the growing tensions
between Hong Kong and Beijing.''
   The secretary, Geoffrey Barnes, was in London with Hong Kong's
governor, Sir David Wilson, for talks with the British government.
   ``In the volatile situation in China, nobody can rule out that a
mass of refugees will attempt to cross the thin wire fence that now
divides China from the New Territories,'' the report said.
   The colony consists of an island and a mainland area called the
New Territories adjoining the south of Guandong province.
   In Beijing, Chinese and diplomatic sources say police have begun
arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the protests and
participants in the resistance to military intervention.
   The Guardian said Barnes stressed that so far there had been no
requests for asylum among the daily handful of Chinese who cross the
border illegally.
   It said that in the past, illegal immigrants were sent back to
China within 24 hours.
   ``But now, in the light of events in China, political asylum will
be granted and, unlike the Vietnamese boat people, whose presence is
causing increasing friction in Hong Kong, Chinese refugees are
certain to be welcomed,'' the report said.
   The military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing
has hurt the Hong Kong economy by raising anxieties over the period
after July 1997, when Great Britain is to hand the colony back to
China under the terms of an agreement signed in 1984.
   China's upheaval already has dealt a serious blow to the Hong
Kong stock exchange and badly shaken confidence in the property
market.
   Officials in the colony said today they fear a drop in its annual
$4.3 billion tourism business as travelers cancel visits because of
the upheaval.
   About 5.6 million people visited Hong Kong last year and 28
percent of them coupled the trip with a visit to China, according to
the Hong Kong Tourist Association.
   Many people now canceling tours to China also are dropping Hong
Kong, said Manuel Woo, executive director of the Hong Kong Hotels
Association.

<HEAD>Leftists Blamed in Killing of Senior Cabinet Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
blamed leftist guerrillas for the assassination of his closest
adviser and said they were ``trying to provoke a reaction'' from his
right-wing government.
   All major political groups condemned the submachine-gun killings
of Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, 73, and two bodyguards Friday
outside the minister's home.
   President Bush issued a White House statement calling the
assassination a ``vicious murder,'' and some Salvadoran politicans
warned it could lead to new political polarization in the nation.
   Rodriguez Porth, a Cabinet member considered Christiani's chief
of staff, was the highest ranking official killed in the 9-year-old
civil war between the U.S.-backed government and the rebels. The
rebels as of early today had not claimed responsibility for the
shootings.
   Guillermo Ungo, a Social Democrat and political ally of the
rebels, said the slaying was ``an assasination in cold blood ...
that does not contribute in any way to peaceful coexistence and
dialogue.''
   Cristiani called Rodriguez ``one of the most illustrious men of
our country'' and told a news conference his adminstration will not
not allow more ``provocations that push our country farther down
into the whirlpool of violence.''
   Cristiani said his government is convinced the leftist Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front (FMLN) is ``trying to provoke a reaction from
us, but we are not going to react outside of the law.''
   Gunmen fired on Rodriguez Porth's car after he left his home in
the capital. He died shortly after he was taken at Zaldivar
Hospital, a nurse said on condition of anonymity. Police said the
two bodyguards, one of whom was driving the car, died at the scene.
   Gerardo Le Chevallier, leader of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, warned the assassinations could mark a new
political polarization in the country.
   He said the attack was the result of ``the declarations of
Cristiani that if the FMLN does not accept its peace proposal there
could be a military response.''
   The rebel front last week offered to halt attacks if the new
right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance government eliminated
death squads. The alliance, known as Arena, denies any involvement
with death squads and spurned the proposal.
   Arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army Maj. Roberto
d'Aubuisson, who has been linked to the squads that killed thousands
of suspected leftists in the early 1980's. He denies the accusations.
   Also among the founders was Rodriguez, who was a vice minister in
the 1940's, a member of the civilian-military junta in 1961 and
foreign minister in 1978.
   Guerrillas have pledged to make the country ungovernable under
the administration of Cristiani, who won a presidential election in
March.
   About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since civil war
broke out in 1980.

   Protesters rallied against the proposed
forced repatriation of Indochinese refugees from Hong Kong, likening
the move to the Voyage of the Damned in 1939.
   They demonstrated outside the British Consulate in San Francisco
on Friday as officials in London urged that Hong Kong send home most
Vietnamese boat people.
   Demonstrators harkened back to the voyage of a German ship loaded
with fleeing Jews who were refused entrance to the United States.
The 900 Jewish passengers aboard the SS St. Louis returned to
various European ports and many later died at Nazi hands. The event
was depicted in the 1975 movie ``Voyage of the Damned'' starring
Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow.
   A spokesman at San Francisco's British Consulate said officials
had no comment. But the colony's British secretary of security,
Geoffrey Barnes, told reporters at a London news conference that
Hong Kong ``has had enough.''
   The refugee problem is creating a second crisis for the British
colony deeply worried about coming under Chinese rule in 1997, he
said.
   Hong Kong has 42,766 Vietnamese boat people, one-third of whom
arrived this year. Barnes said all but 14,150 were simply seeking a
better way of life, rather than political refuge.
   The protesters _ including Jewish representatives, Democratic
lawmakers and former Vietnamese boat people _ carried signs that
read, ``Princess Diana. Don't Let Them Butcher Us'' or that quoted
Margaret Thatcher: ``When people are free to choose, they choose to
be free.''
   Dr. Toan Truong, who escaped from Vietnam just two days before
the fall of Saigon in April 1975, told some 50 rally participants
that forced repatriation was ``something that will be perpetrated by
bloodless bureaucrats.''
   ``This is a crime against humanity,'' said Truong, who was among
two dozen protesters who began a five-day fast to call attention to
their cause.
   Besides the British colony, protesters said countries that may be
considering repatriation include Brunei, Malayasia, Indonesia,
Singapore and Thailand.
   Demonstrators called on Britain to oppose repatriation and the
screening of Southeast Asian immigrants. The issues will be
discussed at the two-day International Conference on Indochinese
Refugees in Geneva beginning Tuesday.

   Federal prosecutors want to guarantee they have a
claim against the assets of former Philippines President Ferdinand
E. Marcos even after he's dead.
   To that end, they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, on Friday.
   The critically ill, 71-year-old Marcos and his 59-year-old wife
are already under a criminal racketeering indictment in New York,
charged with siphoning millions of dollars from their homeland's
treasury.
   The latest lawsuit, filed under the civil aspects of the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, closely parallels
allegations in the 90-count criminal indictment.
   ``The civil complaint was filed in order to ensure that the
interests of the United States as well as the interests of the
victims of the racketeering enterprise will be fully preserved in
the event of the death of Ferdinand E. Marcos,'' said U.S. Attorney
Benito Romano.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said the victims include
the Philippine people and numerous U.S. banks.
   The criminal charges against Marcos and attending forfeiture
claims against his alleged ill-gotten gains would be dismissed after
his death, Romano explained. ``Conversely, a civil complaint filed
by the government against an individual defendant continues against
the estate of a deceased defendant,'' he said.
   Marcos' lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, in Washington, D.C., said he
would fight the civil case as well as the criminal charges.
   John J. Tigue, a New York attorney for Mrs. Marcos, said: ``The
lawsuit will be defended against vigorously, as is the underlying
charge which essentially contains the same allegations.''
   The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since they were
toppled in a popular uprising in February 1986.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the federal charges. Her
husband's ill health kept him from making the trip from Hawaii to
New York for arraignment. In April he was separated from the case,
although the charges were not dropped.
   Marcos, who suffers from heart and lung ailments, has been
hospitalized in Honolulu's St. Francis Medical Center since Jan. 16.
He underwent emergency surgery for kidney failure last month.
   His doctors and lawyers say he is near death.
   A U.S. grand jury indicted the Marcoses and eight others last
October on various charges. Racketeering charges against the
Marcoses accused them of looting more than $103 million from the
Philippines to buy art and real estate in New York City.
   The indictment also said the Marcoses defrauded U.S. banks and
lending institutions of more than $165 million in buying and
financing the choice Manhattan real estate.

<HEAD>Honduras Warns Panama it Will Cut Electricity if Bills Not Paid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduras says it will cut the
electricity it provides to Panama if its Central American's neighbor
does not pay a $4.2 million bill due since 1987.
   Reginaldo Panting, secretary of Economy and Commerce, told a news
conference on Friday that ``our position is not to pressure the
Panamanian government nor the chief of the Defense Forces, Gen.
Antonio Noriega.
   ``We are only trying to get pending bills paid ... and Panama has
a bill with Honduras it has to pay,'' Panting said.
   Honduras provides Panama with about 10 percent of its electrical
service. Honduras has the largest electrical processing plant in
Central America and also sells electricity to neighboring Nicaragua.
   Panting said he traveled to Panama two months ago ``to remind the
government of its debt with Honduras.
   ``At the time, we warned that we could suspend the energy at the
end of the month if Panama doesn't immediately proceed to pay the
debt, but it hasn't done it.''
   He said Panama had discussed the possibility of repaying the debt
with sugar exports to Honduras but has not done so.
   ``Faced with what has happened, we are left with one other
option: cut the electricity we send to Honduras,'' Panting said.
   He said he will travel to Panama again next week in a last
attempt to resolve the problem.
   Noriega is considered Panama's de facto leader. He was indicted
by two Florida grand juries in 1988 on drug trafficking charges, and
the United States has placed economic sanctions on the nation in
effort to force him to step down.

   Americans and Chinese across the country rallied, rang bells and
held candlelight vigils to keep the flame of pro-democracy sentiment
burning despite the brutal crackdown in China.
   ``We don't want people to think that because it is quiet over
there, all is over,'' J.D. Kuo, a Chinese-American research
scientist with G.D. Searle, told about 1,500 people at a downtown
Chicago rally Friday. ``By adding our voices, the students in
Beijing will know people are behind them.''
   Church bells rang throughout Chicago after a moment of silence,
and in New York's Chinatown, more than 5,000 people attended a
memorial service followed by a mock funeral procession for the
victims of the Beijing massacre.
   Marchers carried a figure inspired by the Statue of Liberty,
similar to one displayed by the student protesters in Tiananmen
Square until it was destroyed last weekend.
   ``This has united the Chinese people for one cause _ to overthrow
the government and establish democracy,'' said Peter Lee, one of the
student organizers of the memorial service. ``We must never allow
them to crush another body.''
   Later, more than 15,000 people packed Dag Hammarskjold Plaza
across from the United Nations, many wearing white headbands bearing
the word ``freedom.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch drew cheers when he said, ``All these
students wanted was a chance to speak with their own government
about democracy.'' Koch also promised to rename the corner outside
the Chinese Consulate as Tiananmen Square.
   Under a cold drizzle late Friday, about 100 Chinese students
gathered by candlelight on the steps of Boston's City Hall to lay a
wreath in honor of their fallen comrades back home.
   ``I wish there was more we could do, but at this moment we just
don't know what to do,'' said Yong Lee, a 28-year-old graduate
student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``We're all
very deeply, deeply sad and shocked.''
   Earlier, a rally by University of Massachusetts students in
Northampton was joined by Kui Xu, a graduate student and
granddaughter of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, whose
death on April 15 ignited the pro-democracy movement.
   Students facing final examinations took time out on other
campuses to remember their slain peers in Beijing.
   In Los Angeles, Hispanic students helped Asian-Americans organize
an afternoon march, and friends circulated petitions on behalf of
Tong Bonning, a University of California, Los Angeles, graduate
mathematics exchange student who is missing after returning home
with donations for pro-democracy protestors.
   Chinese students at Princeton University in New Jersey held a
memorial service, and at the University of Pittsburgh, students
opened a multimedia exhibit tracking the pro-democracy movement in
China.
   At the University of California, San Diego, about 150 Chinese and
American students sang John Lennon's ``Imagine'' and other peace
anthems at a mournful noon gathering.
   Sorrow abounded over the Chinese repression of the pro-democracy
movement.
   ``We thought maybe the government was going to change,'' said
S.Y. Cheng, a University of California, Los Angeles, professor
originally from Hong Kong. ``Sometimes I think all of us are too
naive.''
   ``They shouldn't give up. They should continue. They don't fear
dying,'' Zhewu Wang, 31, a visiting scholar at the University of
Iowa from the northeast China city of Harbin, said in Iowa City.

   Pope John Paul II made concessions in
his tour of Scandinavia, but the Catholic pilgrim in the lands of
Luther failed to excite a public already indifferent to its own
church.
   From the fjords of Norway, to barren windswept Iceland to the
high-tech affluence of Sweden, John Paul's tour was unlike any of
his previous trips to Christian countries, even those like Britain
where Roman Catholics are a minority.
   Faced with some reluctance to the visit by Lutheran clergy, the
leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics agreed to sit in
silence in a Lutheran cathedral in Denmark, referred to himself
often as the ``bishop of Rome'' rather than as pope and listened to
chiding by Lutheran bishops.
   Even to his own flock, in a region with marked differences on
sexual morality with Rome's teaching, he used more cautious language
than usual when dealing with family issues.
   For a man used to drawing vast numbers of people, the crowds were
tiny. In his final Mass today of the 10-day tour, in the Swedish
city of Vadstena, about 2,500 youths attended. Roman Catholics
represent less than 1 percent of the population of the five
countries he visited.
   ``I saw the pope in Miami (in 1987). I was very surprised there
were so few people here,'' said Elizabeth Clemmons of Tampa, Fla.,
as the pope stopped in Trondheim, Norway. She plans to marry a
Norwegian.
   There were no protests, although a fundamentalist Protestant
demonstrator rushed toward John Paul during an outdoor Mass Friday.
Security stopped the man, who was unarmed, 30 feet from the pope.
Police said he wanted to hand the pontiff a leaflet.
   The trip is scheduled to end today.
   Vatican officials assured that John Paul was highly pleased with
his trip and said it helped move along Catholic-Lutheran relations.
   ``I don't go to attract the masses, but to preach the gospel,''
John Paul said midway through the trip. ``I go to bring the gospel
everywhere there are Catholics. But I also go to those who are not
Catholics, especially here where there are Christians.''
   The pope appeared to go out of his way to avoid offending.
   In a region where birth control is encouraged and abortion rates
are high, John Paul used such codewords as ``respect for the gift of
life in all its forms,'' rather than resort to explicit language.
   His frequent reference to himself as ``bishop of Rome'' was a
sign of ``sensitivity for the people present,'' explained Australian
Archbishop Edward Cassidy, the Vatican undersecretary of state.
   Other terms, such as supreme pontiff, would be ``quite alien,''
Cassidy said.
   Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden are overwhelmingly
Lutheran although surveys have shown less than 10 percent regularly
attend church on Sundays.
   One of the principal purposes of the trip was to further
relations with the Lutheran Church, dominant since the Protestant
Reformation swept away Catholicism four centuries ago.
   Some Lutheran bishops opposed the visit, and in Denmark they
insisted that John Paul not participate in a prayer service in a
Lutheran cathedral.
   The pope attended, sitting near the altar and following the
service in a prayerbook without speaking.
   Afterward, in an exchange of speeches, Lutheran Bishop Ole
Bertelsen made no secret of differences between Catholics and
Lutherans and told the pope ``nice words and smiling friendly church
leader attitudes are not really what we need right now.''
   Vatican officials, however, viewed the ecumenical meetings as a
success and emphasized it is better to air differing points of view
than to pretend all are in agreement.
   ``After four hundred years of separation, time is needed for the
process of reconciliation and healing to take place,'' John Paul
said Friday in an ecumenical prayer service in Uppsala. ``Not
everything can be done at once, but we must do what we can today
with hope for what may be possible tomorrow.''

   The yellow brick road leads to Holland this
weekend, as four of the original munchkins join fans of ``The Wizard
of Oz.''
   Many believe the author who inspired the film classic, L. Frank
Baum, patterned part of Dorothy's travels to Oz after local sites
and people because he had a summer cottage in this town.
   ``It really reminds me of the set,'' said Margaret Pellegrini,
65, who played one of the ``Sleepyheads'' who welcomed Dorothy to Oz.
   Dorothy apparently was modeled after a neighbor, Dorothy
Martindale, who wore her hair in pigtails and had a small dog, said
festival organizer J.L. Landry. The Emerald Castle is said to be
drawn from nearby Castle Park and a circle of houses called Perry
Circle was the model for Munchkinland, she said.
   This year _ the 50th anniversary of the MGM classic _ will be
especially busy, said Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner who
pronounced the Wicked Witch of the East dead after she was crushed
by Dorothy's house.
   Former munchkins Ruth Duccini and Mary Ellen St. Aubin also
appear at the festival, which runs through Sunday in this
southwestern community near Lake Michigan.

   It's no bull that state Sen. Nancy Larraine
Hoffmann owns a stud that was named after the state's governor.
   Actually, Cuomo is a bull _ all 800 pounds of him.
   Cuomo's odyssey began at the New York State Fair two years ago,
when 4H'er Trista House of Parish, N.Y., won the showmanship ribbon
in the junior division for her cow, Phoebe.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo presented her with the blue ribbon and House was
so moved she decided to name Phoebe's first son after the state's
favorite son.
   Two months ago, Hoffmann was shopping for a breeding bull and
bought Cuomo, unaware of the stud's name.
   ``As soon as we heard, we said, `Oh, no,''' said Hoffmann, a
Democrat. She thought the name would be disrespectful of the
governor, also a Democrat.
   In the end, she decided to steer away from calling the animal
after the governor and changed the bovine's name to Bubba.

<HEAD>FBI Affidavit Alleges Illegal Waste Burning at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead to water supplies for
four Denver suburbs and illegally burned hazardous wastes at the
site, according to an FBI affidavit.
   Both the Department of Energy, which owns the plant, and Rockwell
International Corp., which operates it, covered up the contamination
by stating that the plant was in compliance with environmental laws
and regulations, the affidavit alleged.
   U.S. Magistrate Hilbert Schauer unsealed the affidavit Friday
after a newspaper challenged withholding of the information that led
Schauer to issue a search warrant for a raid on the plant Tuesday by
federal agents.
   The plant, which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons, is 16
miles northwest of Denver.
   The 116-page affidavit indicates the Justice Department
investigation into possible criminal violations of hazardous waste
laws will focus on activities going back to November 1980.
   The affidavit also questions the DOE's decision to award an $8.6
million bonus to Rockwell for excellent management of Rocky Flats.
   The Rocky Mountain News reported in Friday's editions that the
General Accounting Office also has launched an investigation of
performance bonuses awarded Rocky Flats' managers.
   The GAO probe was the third blow sustained by the facility this
week.
   On Tuesday, 75 FBI and Environmental Protection Agency agents
raided Rocky Flats in a move dubbed ``Operation Desert Glow,'' as
part of the Justice Department inquiry. On Wednesday, the Colorado
Department of Health announced it had found 25 environmental
violations at the plant.
   ``We need to check out every allegation that is in this
document,'' Gov. Roy Romer said of the affidavit. ``If it (the
plant) can't meet criteria for health and safety, we close it down.''
   The affidavit revealed that FBI aerial infrared surveillance of
the plant in December found that an incinerator in a plutonium
reprocessing building that was closed for safety violations was
being illegally operated.
   The DOE closed the building in October after an outside warning
sign was accidently covered up, and three DOE inspectors walked in
without protective garb. The building reopened in January.
   The affidavit also alleged that since 1986, Rocky Flats has
generated ``at least 35 to 40 hazardous or mixed wastes sent for
final disposal to various on-site facilities'' that do not have
permits or interim status under the 1976 Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act.
   ``The knowing treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous or
mixed wastes without a permit ... is an RCRA felony,'' the affidavit
said.
   The illegal discharge of pollutants into Walnut Creek occurred
Nov. 15 and 16, the affidavit alleged, adding that the discharges
and subsequent efforts to conceal them violated the Clean Water Act.
Walnut Creek drains into the reservoir for Broomfield, a city of
27,600 residents 10 miles north of Denver.
   The FBI also detected liquid discharges into Woman Creek, which
flows into the lake supplying water to the cities of Westminster,
Northglenn and Thornton, just north of Denver, which have a combined
population of about 157,000.
   Testing of the creeks ``strongly suggests that the contamination
is medical waste originating from a research laboratory or a
pharmacy'' at Rocky Flats, the affidavit said.
   The affidavit went on to say that there was probable cause to
believe Rockwell and DOE officials in November 1985 falsely
certified that Rocky Flats was in compliance with all applicable
groundwater monitoring requirements under the RCRA.
   ``In fact, various Rockwell and DOE officials were aware of
serious contamination and were informed that the monitoring system
was deficient and did not comply with the RCRA,'' the affidavit said.
   Chris Sankey, a DOE spokeswoman in Washington, said agency
officials had not had time to study the affidavit and had no
comment. She also said she was unaware of the GAO investigation.
   In a news release, the department said a special DOE
investigation team has been at Rocky Flats since June 6, but has not
found ``any condition or situation which presents an imminent danger
to the public's health or safety.''
   Dennis Hurtt, a Rockwell spokesman in Denver, declined to comment
Friday. He said Rockwell attorneys were reviewing the affidavit.

<HEAD>U.S. to Interview Japanese Monk About American POWs in Vietnam</HEAD>

   An American military attache will interview a
Japanese monk who has reportedly said he saw American prisoners in
the re-education camp where he was held in Vietnam, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said today.
   The monk's daughter quoted her father as saying he shared a cell
with three American prisoners for the last six years he spent in
captivity. She said her father did not remember their names but
described them as young and healthy.
   The monk, Iwanobu Yoshida, 65, reportedly suffers from mental
disorders and a speech impediment. He has been hospitalized since
January when he returned to Japan after being released from 14 years
of imprisonment in Vietnam.
   In the past week he has given his first interviews to the
Japanese media, raising interest with claims he saw Americans held
since the Vietnam War.
   Vietnam denies holding American prisoners, and recently it has
cooperated with U.S. officials searching for remains of Americans
missing in action.
   Yoshida's daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, told The Associated Press
today that her father communicated with the Americans in his cell
through gestures.
   ``My father told me that when he asked them if they were
Americans, they nodded,'' Ms. Takatsuka said during a telephone
interview from her home in Sapporo on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost
island. She said the prisoners were not allowed to speak to each
other.
   Her report differed from one earlier in the week on the Kyodo
News Service in which Yoshida was quoted as saying he saw ``five or
six'' American POWs but never spoke with them and had been held
apart from them. The location of the re-education camp has not been
disclosed.
   Ms. Takatsuka told AP the Kyodo reporter must have misunderstood
because her father told her several times he had been held with the
Americans.
   A U.S. military attache will travel to Sapporo on Sunday to
interview Yoshida, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, speaking
anonymously.
   He said Ms. Takatsuka met with a U.S. Navy attache at the U.S.
Embassy in Tokyo recently to report on her father's remarks and that
the information was forwarded to Washington for analysis.
   Ms. Takatsuka initially refused to speak with U.S. officials,
saying her father was too ill, according to the embassy spokesman.
   Yoshida suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment,
said Hidenori Hareyama, a spokesman for Shiraishi Tokushukai
Hospital on Hokkaido where Yoshida is being treated.
   Only Yoshida's daughter can understand what he says and his
speech is at times incoherent, Hareyama said. He refused to
elaborate.
   Yoshida, a Buddhist monk, told the Kyodo News Service that
Vietnamese political prisoners also called the foreigners in the
camp Americans.
   Ms. Takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of the
three held in his cell but said they were still ``young and
healthy.''
   Yoshida told her he saw more American POWs, perhaps more than 10,
before he suffered a stroke three years ago. ``My father is still
afraid somebody will come and get him to throw him back in the
Vietnamese prison,'' she said.
   Yoshida, formerly a city councilman in Mibari on Hokkaido, became
a monk in 1966 and emigrated to Vietnam, where he set up a temple in
Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City. He was granted South Vietnamese
citizenship in 1973, then was arrested in 1975 after the takeover of
South Vietnam by communist forces.
   On Jan. 20, Vietnam released Yoshida for humanitarian reasons
after appeals by international human rights groups including Amnesty
International.
   A total of 1,730 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Vietnam, and 634 are missing in Cambodia, Laos and China, according
to U.S. figures.
   The Indochina war ended in 1975 with communist victories over
U.S.-supported governments in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

   Syrian gunners shelled the coast north of
Beirut today, killing four people and wounding six, as an Arab envoy
tried to halt 12 weeks of bloodshed between Syrian and Christian
forces.
   A police spokesman said about 200 shells and rockets fired from
Syrian batteries in Moslem west Beirut exploded around the Christian
ports of Jounieh and Byblos early in the day.
   He said the fatalities were ``civilians killed near Jounieh when
a 107mm Katyusha rocket hit a residential district near the harbor.''
   The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people
killed and 1,427 wounded since the current round of violence broke
out March 8 between Aoun's Christian army units and an alliance of
Syrian-Druse forces.
   The escalation coincided with the arrival in Beirut of Lakhdar
Ibrahimi, assistant Arab League secretary general, in a renewed
effort to stabilize a cease-fire.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line for
talks with Aoun at the general's bunker office under the
bomb-ravaged presidential palace of Baabda, east of the capital.
   Ibrahimi drove to Moslem west Beirut from Damascus, the Syrian
capital, Friday and held separate meetings with Salim Hoss, who
heads the Moslem Cabinet in the nation's dual government, and
Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini.
   The Arab envoy was dispatched to Lebanon by the leaders of
Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Algeria to seek compliance with a
cease-fire called May 26. The committee of three Arab League heads
of state was formed to find a solution to the 14-year civil war
within six months.
   The three leaders also sent their foreign ministers on a tour of
Syria, Iraq and the five permanent member states of the U.N.
Security Council to promote a proposed settlement for the Lebanese
crisis.
   The ministers _ Prince Saud Al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Abdel
Latif Al-Filali of Morocco and Bouallam Bsayeh of Algeria _ held a
second, six-hour meeting Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus.
   Details of the discussions were not officially disclosed.
   The three foreign ministers today arrived in Baghdad, where they
were greeted by foreign minister Tariq Aziz.
   Al-Filali told reporters: ``We are sure we will find complete
cooperation from Iraqi officials in trying to find a solution to the
Lebanese crisis.''
   Before leaving Syria, the Algerian foreign minister said, ``We
tried in Damascus to define the major subjects that could be
achieved in the forseeable future.'' He said that ``the solution is,
in the end, in the hands of the Lebanese, and we were able to see
Damascus' willingness to help Lebanon.''
   The independent Beirut daily paper An-Nahar said the three were
soliciting support for a seven-point settlement proposal.
   The plan, according to the paper, calls for ``exerting
international pressure on Israel to withdraw its forces from south
Lebanon.''
   It also proposes the ``deployment of an Algerian force'' along a
75-mile stretch of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast to prevent the
import and export of illegal material at the various ports.
   The coastal strip referred to in the plan extends from just above
the southern provincial capital of Sidon, through Beirut, to the
northern city of Tripoli.
   The scenario also calls for ``lifting all sea, land and air
blockades, reopening blocked roads between the sectors, including
the Beirut-Damascus highway'' that runs across sections of Lebanon
controlled by warring Christian and Druse militias, the paper said.
   It said Arab military observers would be deployed at the
crossings and along the Beirut-Damascus highway.
   The plan also calls for ``convening a session of the Lebanese
parliament to consider a draft for political reforms and the
election by parliament of a president who would pledge to implement
the reforms.''
   The last point in the plan calls for ``discussing the question of
Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.''
   Israel controls a 6-to-10-mile deep strip of Lebanese territory
along their border. It serves as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski says the
Communist Party's resounding defeat in Poland's freest postwar
elections may have been only a passing phenomenon.
   At the Polish Embassy in London today, a small group of Polish
emigres protested Gen. Jaruzelski's visit, with one banner
declaring: ``From Poland to Peking, communism brings death.''
   Jaruzelski arrived in London today after a one-day visit to
Belgium, and he met for 25 minutes with Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe at Heathrow Airport.
   In Belgium, Jaruzelski said the election results were ``a
reflection not only of the attitudes but also of the emotions of the
Polish people.''
   ``But as you know, emotions are sometimes ephemeral,'' he said in
an interview in Brussels with the British Broadcasting Corp. He
spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated.
   Following a stop to lay a wreath at Polish war graves in England
today, the Communist Party leader was to meet with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher for lunch at her country estate, Chequers. He
plans to return to Poland on Sunday.
   Members of Solidarity with Solidarity, a British-based group,
organized their weekend vigil outside the embassy near a separate
weeklong vigil outside the Chinese Embassy.
   ``We are not saying that what happened in Poland was as bad as
the Chinese massacres,'' said protest organizer Barbara Rudewicz,
referring to the Chinese army's attacks on pro-democracy protesters
a week ago. ``But in 1981, it was Gen. Jaruzelski who brought out
the tanks onto the streets of Poland, when several hundred people
were killed during martial law.''
   Solidarity was crushed at that time and later banned. It was
legalized under an April pact with the government.
   In a statement released Friday, Solidarity with Solidarity
described Jaruzelski as ``a man decisively rejected by his nation''
in Sunday's elections.
   In the Polish voting for the new 100-seat Senate, Solidarity won
92 seats and the other eight were undecided. Independent candidates
were allowed to run for only 161 seats in the existing 460-seat
Sejm, or lower house, but they won 160 of them.
   Only two of 35 top Communist Party leaders and their allies
running on a special list of unopposed candidates gained a majority
of ``yes'' votes, allowing them to take seats without a new election.
   Jaruzelski said in a British newspaper interview this week that
he would stand by the results and suggested that his Communist Party
could lose power in totally free elections in 1993.
   In the BBC interview, Jaruzelski said the elections were not a
``football match ... it is a political process.''
   He referred ruefully to his imposition of martial law in Poland
in 1981 and his banning of the free trade union Solidarity.
   ``Sometimes it takes a long time before the revolution becomes
civilized,'' said Jaruzelski. ``We could not avoid it either.''
   Mrs. Thatcher invited Jaruzelski to Britain after she visited
Poland last November and met with both government and Solidarity
leaders.
   British officials said the prime minister was interested in
talking with Jaruzelski about the elections and his plans for the
future.
   Jaruzelski's visit is part of widening contacts between Poland
and Western government leaders, who have welcomed the Polish reforms.
   French President Francois Mitterrand will visit Poland next week
and President Bush is due to go there July 9-11.

   Hundreds of radical students today
battled police with firebombs, rocks and clubs after protesters
demanded the Seoul government let them take part in a youth festival
in communist North Korea.
   Police reported more than 1,000 arrests.
   About 2,000 students fought riot police at two campuses in Seoul
after they were blocked from marching into the streets to denounce
President Roh Tae-woo's government and the United States. Thirty
student leaders were seized trying to reach the North Korean border
for talks with communist officials, police said.
   About 1,500 students fought police with iron pipes, clubs and
rocks at Yonsei University and about 500 students threw firebombs
and rocks at police at nearby Sogang University. Police hurled rocks
back at students but did not use tear gas.
   ``Crush the Roh Tae-woo regime!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
students yelled.
   Hundreds of students later battled police in central Seoul,
hurling rocks and bricks. Riot squads used tear gas to break up the
protesters and chased the students through the streets. Shoppers and
pedestrians fled for cover.
   Troops and students were injured in the fighting, but the police
had no figures on casualties.
   More than 1,000 students were arrested in the clashes or as they
tried to reach the universities to take part in a second day of
protests, police said.
   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul to block the university
demonstrations. About 6,000 troopers in green combat fatigues and
visored helmets ringed Yonsei and Sogang, outnumbering the
demonstrators.
   The protests came after students staged rallies at the two
colleges to demand to take part in the 13th World Youth Festival
next month in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Radical
students are calling for unification with the communist North.
   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend the youth
festival, an athletic and cultural festival attended mainly by
non-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the North
of attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoul
government.
   Student leaders charge that Roh and the United States keep the
Korean peninsula divided. They have called for the overthrow of Roh
and expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   The two Koreas are bitter rivals. They have clashed frequently
over the years. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the
Korean War.
   Radical students and dissidents have been calling for the fall of
the Roh government, but they lack support because of their extreme
views and violent tactics.

<HEAD>Six Sentenced to Death by Stoning for Adultery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHAIRPUR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lower court today convicted six
people of adultery and sentenced them to death by stoning under an
Islamic law.
   Judge Mirza Saeed Beg invoked the controversial ``Hadood
Ordinance'' enacted in 1979 by former President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   It was the first such ruling since Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
came to power in December. The U.S.-eductated Ms. Bhutto has pledged
to press for repeal of the Islamic law, which imposes harsh
punishment for moral offenses and limits women's rights.
   Beg's court convicted Ghulam Qadir Sher and Noor Khatoon of
marrying illegally because Ms. Khatoon failed to secure a proper
divorce from her previous husband, Shaikh Anver Ali Sher.
   The court found four of Qadir Sher's friends guilty as
accomplices for helping arrange his marriage with Ms. Khatoon.
   No date was set for the executions. Members of the Khatoon and
Qadir Sher families said they would appeal to a Sindh province high
court.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party has called for
the repeal of all discriminatory Islamic laws promulgated under
Zia's 11-year rule.
   As chief of the army, Gen. Zia toppled Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him
executed two years later. Zia died in a plane crash in August. An
inquiry found the plane was downed by saboteurs but was unable to
identify them.
   Repeal of the laws passed under Zia would require majorities in
both houses of Parliament. Ms. Bhutto's sizeable right-wing
opposition has said it will block any government move against the
Islamic ordinances.

   A storm slammed Philadelphia with heavy rain,
winds up to 120 mph and a tornado, disrupting power to thousands of
customers and leaving one person dead and one seriously injured.
   A suspected tornado in Delaware's New Castle County, across the
state line southeast of Philadelphia, destroyed at least one house
and a school gymnasium, damaged at least four other homes and
knocked out power to about 1,000 customers Friday evening,
authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   The twister landed in Philadelphia's affluent Society Hill
section about 7:15 p.m. and slashed northeast for half a mile to the
Delaware River, the National Weather Service said.
   Police and witnesses said the funnel cloud then skipped across
the river and damaged a dozen houses in Camden, N.J. The weather
service said it had not investigated the Camden damage and could not
confirm a tornado there.
   The body of girl who apparently fell into a rain-swollen
tributary of Cobbs Creek in suburban Upper Darby during the storm
was found two miles downstream late Friday, said Upper Darby
Township Detective Ron Lavin. The victim was identified today as
13-year-old Alix Christina Lidle of Upper Darby.
   Police said a man was blown into a Society Hill telephone booth.
He was listed in stable but guarded condition with a head injury
early today in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
   The north and west walls of a three-story parking garage
collapsed during the storm, damaging two parked vehicles and a
nearby house, police said.
   Officer Michael Beren said a sudden darkness descended while he
was on patrol.
   ``I couldn't see two feet in front of my face,'' he said. ``It
was black and dark _ and then there was a roar.''
   The tornado was 50 yards wide at points, the weather service said.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. spokesman Michael Wood said about 4,500
customers lost power for at least part of the evening.
   A Camden family had to be evacuated from their home after a beam
crashed through the ceiling, said Camy Trinidad, a spokeswoman for
the Camden County Red Cross.

   Chinese authorities announced tonight the arrests
of 400 people accused of attacks on soldiers imposing martial law.
The arrests included several leaders of independent student and
worker associations.
   China also criticized a Voice of America radio broadcast for
reporting that troops killed 3,000 residents, and it claimed
soldiers ``did not fire even once'' in their push to drive
pro-democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square.
   Deng Xiaoping, 84, emerged Friday from three weeks of seclusion
to praise soldiers who crushed the pro-democracy protests and show
who is leading the world's most populous country. Despite Deng's
show of political stability, foreigners continued to flee China
today.
   On Friday night, the nationally televised news accused Fang
Lizhi, a leading astrophysicist and China's best-known dissident, of
being a traitor who incited the ``rebellion'' and provoked the
violence. Fang, who avoided the student protests on Tiananmen
Square, has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
   The official attack on Fang and the U.S. decision to protect him
could strain relations between China and the United States, which
has condemned the violent crackdown on the pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The nationally televised news tonight said the 400 people who
were arrested included Gua Haifeng, a Beijing University student who
was secretary of the United Association of Beijing Universities, the
independent student group that led seven weeks of protests.
   It said several other students and workers were arrested but gave
no other names. It showed footage of non-students, identified only
as ``scoundrels,'' being questioned by police, one under gunpoint.
   Western reporters saw soldiers take three people into custody at
gunpoint on the street.
   The arrests came as the government intensified a propaganda
campaign that claimed troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries were
responsible for the violence last weekend, when soldiers in tanks
rolled into central Beijing and recaptured Tiananmen Square from
student protesters.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing today sent a convoy to nearby Tianjin
to evacuate 89 foreign tourists, students, scholars and oil
technicians. Most were Americans. They said Tianjin had been quiet
the past week but that they were leaving because the U.S. State
Department recommended it.
   Also today, the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper,
accused the U.S. government-backed Voice of America of being
``irresponsible'' in reporting that 3,000 people died.
   The newspaper said the U.S. broadcast was aimed at instigating
hatred and resistance.
   Official Radio Beijing said today: ``In the process of clearing
out the square (Tiananmen), the Liberation Army did not fire even
once at the crowd of people.''
   The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault,
and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters.
Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatally
shot along the road and in the square, and U.S. intelligence reports
put the death toll at about 3,000.
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in the
Federal Republic, a Chinese group in West Germany.
   Chinese-language broadcasts of VOA and the British Broadcasting
Co. are hugely popular among people trying to obtain information
about events in China outside the government-controlled media. Some
VOA channels have been jammed since martial law was imposed on
Beijing on May 20.
   Since last weekend, official television and radio have repeatedly
praised the military and accused demonstrators of being
counterrevolutionaries bent on destroying the socialist system.
   Authorities have told all participants in the movement to turn
themselves in. Phone numbers have been provided so citizens can turn
in protesters.
   Beijing radio said today that city officials had received 167
``important'' reports by Friday afternoon on the hotlines.
   Deng appeared on national television Friday night with other top
officials and in an impassioned speech to military officers, gave
the clear message that he was in control.
   Among those accompanying him was conservative Premier Li Peng.
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, reported to have been ousted from
power for opposing the martial law crackdown, was absent.
   Deng, while initiating bold economic reforms over the past decade
which have improved the lives of millions of China, is a political
conservative who regards ferment for greater freedom as a threat to
the state.
   In Beijing, tens of thousands of troops remain, with large
contingents at Tiananmen Square and in the university area to the
northwest. Armed soldiers were seen guarding a truck bringing
vegetables into the city and stopping cars to ask for identification.
   Demonstrations, some violent, have broken out in more than a
dozen Chinese cities since the assault on Beijing last weekend.
   The official media have reported dozens of arrests of people who
joined in anti-government protests. Television showed soldiers
patrolling the southwestern city of Chengdu and the ruins of a
department store burned by protesters. Police were shown making
arrests in Wuhan, Changsha and Harbin, among the cities where
protesters burned buses and blocked roads.

   Peggy Middleswart experienced the pain of
hearing that her husband was dead, then the joy of what she called a
miracle.
   After a medical crew spent 45 minutes trying to revive Jerry
Middleswart on Friday at Oswego Memorial Hospital, Mrs. Middleswart
was told her husband was dead.
   For 40 minutes, she waited in a daze for her children to arrive.
Then a nurse noticed that Middleswart was breathing.
   ``I just waited there ... waited for my kids to get to the
hospital,'' she said. ``When the nurse saw that he was breathing
again, everyone was shocked. It was a miracle.''
   Middleswart's condition deteriorated somewhat and he was put on a
respirator early today, a hospital supervisor said.
   Middleswart, a veterinarian, and a friend, Jesse Nash, had been
pronounced dead of electrical shock after an antenna they were
installing brushed against a power line.
   ``He was very, very dead. He was deader than a doornail,'' said
Dr. Phillip Bortmes, who had tried to revive Middleswart.
   ``He was a friend of mine,'' Bortmes said. ``I made damn sure I
tried everything before I stopped working on him.''
   But at 10:45 a.m., Bortmes pronounced Middleswart dead. Last
rites were performed.
   ``They told me that he had died and had left him to work on the
other man,'' Mrs. Middleswart said.
   According to the Labette County Sheriff's Department,
Middleswart, 47, and Nash, 68, had been putting an antenna on the
Oswego Veterinary Clinic where Middleswart practices. Five men were
helping them, and all seven had their hands on the antenna when it
touched a 7,600-volt power line at 10 a.m.
   The men were thrown back from the antenna and neighbors who saw
the accident rushed them to the hospital.
   Mary Chapin, the hospital's director of nursing, said Nash and
Middleswart had no pulse and were not breathing when they arrived
shortly after 10:10 a.m.
   The other men were in stable condition with burns on their hands
and feet, Chapin said.
   After Middleswart began breathing, he was transported to the
coronary care unit at St. John's Hospital in Joplin, Mo., where he
was in critical condition this morning.
   Although he was breathing on his own Friday night, he was later
put back on a respirator, said nursing supervisor Judy Russell. She
classified him as in a coma and said the extent of brain damage due
to lack of oxygen had not been determined.

<HEAD>Premier Proposes Sharp Reductions In Soviet Bureaucracy</HEAD>
<UNK>By ANDREW KATELL ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov today proposed sharp
reductions in the vast Soviet bureaucracy and said the remaining
government ministries should turn many of their powers over to the
nation's 15 republics.
   Speaking to a joint session of the bicameral Supreme Soviet _ a
new 542-member, full-time legislature _ Ryzhkov said that of the 50
government ministries handling basic elements of the economy _
construction, transportation, agriculture and defense _ only 32
would remain.
   In addition, he told the lawmakers in a session broadcast live on
radio and television that the number of members of the Council of
Ministers, or Cabinet that he heads, will be slashed from 100 to 10.
   The proposals, which the legislature is to vote on later this
month, mark another step in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
attempts to streamline the Soviet bureaucracy he has blamed for
impeding his economic reforms. They would also transfer many
economic management functions to the 15 Soviet republics, many of
which are campaigning for greater control over their affairs.
   Ryzhkov, the 59-year-old technocrat re-elected premier on
Wednesday, said the remaining ministries in Moscow will focus on
long-range planning and on scientific and technological help in the
spheres they oversee. The ministries would leave the day-to-day
managment they now provide to the republics.
   At the same time, two special commissions are to be formed, one
to handle emergencies such as natural and man-made disasters and
another to map economic reforms.
   Since Gorbachev became Communist Party leader in March 1985, he
has tried to rid Soviet society of a half-century of top-heavy,
bureaucratic management ``by command'' epitomized by dictator Josef
V. Stalin.
   The government ministries were a frequent target during 13 days
of debate in the new Soviet parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies.
   At one point, deputy Anatoly Miloserdny of Byelorussia blamed the
Council of Ministers for short-sightedness that he said led to ``the
disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.''
   Gorbachev himself urged the deputies to grill the ministers on
why they are dragging their feet on reforms. He acknowledged
complaints that government ministries ``are restructuring very
slowly, if at all'' and said: ``We have to find out what is wrong.''
   Ryzhkov announced nominees for the Cabinet posts today, and the
Supreme Soviet is scheduled to hold confirmation hearings on them
beginning June 19.
   The Congress of People's Deputies wrapped up its session Friday
after hearing Andrei D. Sakharov, 68, father of the Soviet human
rights movement, say the parliament had ``not fulfilled its main
task _ to establish a system of power to overcome economic and
social problems, to put an end to ecological madness.''
   The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate also claimed that by electing
Gorbachev president in an uncontested election and investing him
with far greater powers in his 5-year term, the parliament had given
the Communist Party chief ``absolute personal power.''
   Gorbachev, to loud applause in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses,
vigorously objected to what he termed Sakharov's attempt to
``abase'' the Congress' work.

   A train traveling from a Black Sea resort rammed

the Soviet Union's second major train accident this week, Tass
reported today.
   The official Soviet news agency said the bus was crossing
railroad tracks at the village of Kamenskaya-Pogorelovo, 640 miles
southwest of Moscow when it was hit by the train Friday afternoon.
   Tass said a railroad worker had flagged the bus driver to move
onto the tracks, but the report did not say if he faced punishment.
   The train, traveling at 50 mph from the popular Black Sea resort
of Adler to the Russian city of Voronezh, could not stop in time to
avoid colliding with the bus, Tass said.
   Twenty-nine people, including two children, were killed instantly
and two died en route to a hospital. Fourteen people were
hospitalized, Tass said.
   The news agency said 46 passengers were on the bus. It did not
say whether the train carried passengers or freight.
   The accident happened at the same spot where 106 people were
killed in a collision of two trains on Aug. 7, 1987, the news agency
reported.
   On Sunday, a gas pipeline exploded as two passenger trains were
passing on the Trans-Siberian Railroad 750 miles southeast of Moscow
in the Ural Mountains. At least 190 passengers were killed and
hundreds injured.
   Last year, 464 Soviets were killed in accidents at railroad
intersections, and 16,013 have died this year in all kinds of
traffic accidents, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
the Soviet Union visits West Germany next week, he'll look a lot
more like a budding capitalist than a communist.
   With superpower relations rapidly improving, Gorbachev is turning
his attention to improving his nation's faltering economy.
   The inquisitive president will find there's much to learn from
West Germany, one of the world's richest countries and the global
leader in exports.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev's main target is to improve the situation of the
Soviet population. West Germany has high-tech know-how and
high-quality machinery that would be useful for this,'' says Peter
Pietsch, an economist at the Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
   Moscow is eager to intensify economic relations with West
Germany, says Ivan Silayev, a deputy premier in the Kremlin. Soviet
officials said in Moscow last week that an estimated 40 million
Soviet citizens live in poverty, and warned the country could face
economic collapse in the next years.
   ``Economic cooperation with the Federal Republic (West Germany)
is of great importance. It is the basis on which the whole field of
relations between the U.S.S.R. and the Federal Republic will be
broadened,'' Silayev wrote in an article for the June 6 editions of
West Germany's Die Welt newspaper.
   The four-day trip starting Monday takes Gorbachev to
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the country's richest state, for demonstrations
of high technology and talks with local leaders.
   Baden-Wuerttemberg is home to Daimler-Benz, the country's largest
company. The state-owned Soviet transport company already uses
Daimler-Benz trucks.
   The visit also will take Gorbachev to the Ruhr region, once
Germany's industrial heartland and now a leader in retooling for
high-tech businesses. In addition, Gorbachev will see the Hoesch
steel factory, a new Ruhr-area rolling mill that sells to the
Soviets.
   Recent polls show that Gorbachev is immensely popular in West
Germany, and the growing ``Gorbymania'' will be in evidence wherever
the Soviet president reaches out to ordinary citizens.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other political leaders will be
keeping that in mind when they discuss arms control and other
international issues with the Soviet chief.
   ``Gorbymania'' is such an overriding factor that the mass
circulation Bild newspaper even asked Kohl if the visit would help
the chancellor's conservative party in this month's European
parliament elections.
   ``Oh, come on now!'' Kohl snapped. ``The dates have nothing to do
with each other.''
   There has been some concern in the United States and other
countries that West Germany is growing fond of Gorbachev.
   Kohl responds that the success of Gorbachevs's reforms will
benefit everyone. And West German businessmen want to be among the
first beneficiaries.
   ``We see a huge market in the Soviet Union,'' said Heinz
Skrzipietz, spokesman for the Salamander shoe company, which sold 2
million pairs of shoes to the Soviets last year.
   ``Shoes are something everyone needs, and we can provide them''
he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from the
company's offices in the Baden-Wuerttemberg town of Kornwestheim.
   West German banks have also jumped on the perestroika bandwagon.
Perestroika, a Russian term, refers to Gorbachev's economic and
social restructuring of Soviet society to make it run more
efficiently.
   Last year a German bank consortium made a $1.53 billion line of
credit available to the Soviets for buying West German machinery to
help improve the communist country's food, textile and clothing
industries.
   ``A small amount of money has been drawn from this line of credit
so far,'' said Pietsch, the economist. Commerzbank is one of the
nine banks included in the consortium.
   ``It takes time to draw on all this money'' because of
negotiations on what projects to undertake using the credit, he said.
   Gorbachev is still struggling to attain reforms that would not
only help his country's economy but also improve the business
climate for foreign firms.
   ``There is still a very long way to go,'' said Karl-Hermann Fink,
secretary-general of the German East-West Trade Committee, which
coordinates business ties between the countries.
   Soviet-West German trade slumped during the middle of the 1980s
but bounced back last year, reaching $8.36 billion, up 8 percent
from the year before.
   West Germany is currently the Soviet Union's biggest supplier in
the West, but only about 1.5 percent of West Germany's exports go to
the communist country.
   The Soviets buy West German goods ranging from high-quality
machine tools to consumer items. They sell energy products to their
German trading partners.
   The Soviet Union is especially eager to increase the number of
joint ventures with Western companies, since such operations employ
local workers and give business to Soviet materials suppliers.

   In 1982, a homosexual man with AIDS had a 30
percent chance of living for 18 months.
   In 1987, he had a 60 percent chance of living that long.
   In 1982, doctors had only a vague idea of how AIDS was spreading
and no idea what was causing it. Today they know its cause, they
have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study.
   ``None of us can be satisfied until no patient dies of AIDS, but
there is some progress,'' said Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the
U.S. National Cancer Institute and a principal developer of the drug
AZT, the only one so far approved to treat AIDS.
   He spoke at the fifth International Conference on AIDS, which
ended Friday. It drew 11,800 people, including 1,320 journalists and
hundreds of activists, to Montreal to discuss the scientific, social
and human sides of AIDS.
   The conference's organizers were forced to turn away others
because Montreal's convention center couldn't accommodate any more.
   Broder's surprisingly optimistic assessment of progress toward
better AIDS treatments contrasted with the pessimistic viewpoints
expressed a year ago at the last international AIDS conference, in
Stockholm.
   Many researchers there expressed disappointment with experimental
drug trials and efforts to develop a vaccine. But a year has passed,
and the picture has improved.
   ``Things are moving much more quickly now,'' said Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the AIDS program at the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md.
   This year's conference was also distinguished by the
participation of several hundred AIDS activists who demonstrated
inside and outside the convention center every day.
   They booed government officials for not moving faster against
AIDS. They demanded anti-discrimination protection, access to
experimental treatments and more money for research.
   Some of them were people with AIDS, or PWAs, as they often call
themselves. Their message was simple. As their hand-lettered,
cardboard signs said: We are all living with AIDS.
   Some scientists said they were unhappy that AIDS interest groups
were allowed to attend because the protests distracted the
scientists from their work. Others welcomed the reminder of the
human side of the disease.
   In the scientific sessions, several groups reported initial
success with AIDS vaccines in chimpanzees and monkeys. Among them
was Dr. Jonas Salk, who attracted media attention as the
world-famous developer of the polio vaccine, but whose research
findings were said to be no better than those of several other
research groups.
   Some of the most promising research dealt with the development of
new drugs for AIDS.
   AZT is extending the life span of AIDS patients, but it has toxic
side effects. And in a disturbing development, studies have shown
that the AIDS virus can develop a resistance to AZT, making the drug
no longer effective.
   ``The surprise is it took this long to discover it,'' said Dr.
Robert Yarchoan of the U.S. National Cancer Institute.
   On the other hand, the virus strains resistant to AZT do not seem
to be resistant to other AZT-like drugs now under study. ``That's
been a surprise on the good side,'' Yarchoan said.
   AZT is one of a class of drugs called reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. It mimics genetic building blocks needed by the AIDS
virus to link with genes inside cells to make more virus.
   Two newer drugs under study, ddC and ddI, work the same way and
are among the most promising new agents, said Dr. Thomas Merigan of
Stanford University, a member of the committee overseeing federal
drug trials in the United States.
   As with cancer treatment, the use of a combination of drugs might
maximize their beneficial effects while minimizing their side
effects, he said.
   Perhaps the most exciting new drugs are so-called soluble CD4 and
its relatives. These drugs interfere with the process by which the
AIDS virus invades cells.
   ``They have to add up to one of our best prospects,'' Merigan
said.
   Studies are just starting to show that CD4 can reduce levels of
virus in the body, he said. Whether that will improve the health of
infected people is not yet known.
   Some drugs that have been tested have flopped. They include
dextran sulfate, which looked promising a year or two ago, and
AL-721, a drug that many AIDS patients had pushed for.
   Merigan said he doubted the usefulness of dextran sulfate from
the start, but that 50 patients were used to study the drug in
response to pressure and criticism from Congress.
   ``It means that our ddC study would have been 50 patients ahead
if we didn't have this pressure,'' he said.
   But, Merigan said, researchers are working as quickly as possible
to evaluate new drugs.
   Broder predicted that the experimental results and the AIDS
patients' survival curves would be even better next year and the
year after that.

<HEAD>Campaigning For Party Leadership Posts Intense, But Behind Scenes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They haven't bought television time or
full-page newspaper ads, but the campaigning is still intense in the
precinct of the House of Representatives where Democrats are trying
to fill their top leadership posts.
   Even at this weekend's Paris Air Show, junketing lawmakers may
find their gourmet meals interrupted by telephone calls from the
candidates seeking their votes in next Wednesday's election.
   Two of the top three officers the Democrats re-elected just six
months ago have resigned their leadership posts because of questions
about their personal finances.
   Speaker Jim Wright stepped down rather than continue his struggle
against charges by the ethics committee that he violated House rules
on outside income and gifts. The No. 3 Democrat, Majority Whip Tony
Coelho of California, said he would step down rather than face
inquiry into a junk bond deal.
   Last week, Democrats elected Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the
former majority leader, as speaker of the House.
   But even before that vote, the campaigning for Foley's old job
and the whip's job had already begun. In the personal campaigning of
Congress, the first person to ask for a member's vote is considered
likely to get it.
   ``If you wait more than 37 seconds after there's a vacancy you're
27 votes behind,'' quipped Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio.
   The two candidates seeking to replace Foley as the No. 2 man _
and become the natural successors to the speakership _ are Reps.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.
   Gephardt, who is considered the favorite by most people including
Jenkins supporters, gave up a post in the House leadership to run
for president in 1988.
   He announced his campaign for majority leader with a
presidential-style press release, declaring he was part of a ``new
generation'' that will lead the House and the Democratic party into
the future.
   And in the current ethics climate, one of Gephardt's strongest
cards is the feeling that he is certified ``clean,'' because running
for president would have exposed any skeletons in his background. He
has promised, if elected, he will not run for president in 1992.
   Jenkins is from the more conservative side of the party, and he
says it's time Democrats include that viewpoint in the top
leadership. If not, ``We shall continue to lose in national
elections. It's that simple,'' he said.
   Both Jenkins and Gephardt are members of the Ways and Means
Committee. Jenkins enjoys the support of that panel's powerful
chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Jenkins said late last week he would reassess his chances on
Tuesday, and discussions were already underway for installing a
conservative as a top leadership deputy if he didn't win. But ``I
will not be satisfied personally'' by that, he said.
   The whip's race is a three-way event with each candidate already
in a prominent party role.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., is chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus. Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., is chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And Rep. David Bonior
is the chief deputy whip.
   Gray's campaign has had to battle news reports that his personnel
practices were under scrutiny by the Justice Department. His office
sent videotapes to House Democrats on the issue, Gray held a press
conference attacking the news leaks, and he released affidavits from
his staff supporting his claim that he is not the subject of an
inquiry.
   However, the reports appear to have cut the momentum many
expected would lead Gray to a big win. His supporters still contend
he's ahead, but they're not confident a first-ballot victory and
Gray is running hard.
   Gray recently reached a delegation of lawmakers visiting Turkey.
One of his top aides said late last week that he was already on the
telephone to Paris, where about six dozen lawmakers were attending
the big annual aviation gathering.
   Both Bonior and Anthony also were burning up the telephone lines,
although one top Bonior staffer expressed some jealousy at Gray's
success in overseas calling.
   ``We're trying to save the taxpayers money. We're not doing a lot
of overseas calling,'' she said, smiling.
   Bonior's people claim to be within about 10 votes of Gray, and
said they could beat him on a second ballot if no candidate received
a majority in the first round.
   But predicting a winner in the secret-ballot contests _ except in
a case like Foley's where he's unopposed _ is a risky business.
   ``I think uncommitted is a very popular candidate,'' Eckart said.

<HEAD>Goodwill Generating Ill Will in Congressional Debate on Savings and
Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No issue in the savings and loan debate has
generated so much ill will as the question of goodwill.
   President Bush's proposed S&amp;L plan, the most expensive bailout in
U.S. history, goes to the House floor this week, probably Wednesday,
and legislators likely will spend most of their time debating what
until recently has been an obscure accounting issue.
   Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about goodwill.
   Q: What is goodwill?
   A: Goodwill is the difference between what a business, in this
case a savings institution, is worth if shut down and liquidated and
what it would fetch if sold as a going concern. Goodwill represents
such intangible assets as customer loyalty and name recognition.
   Q: Why is it important in the savings and loan debate?
   A: President Bush wants to force S&amp;L owners to risk more of their
own money _ capital _ as a buffer between losses and the government
deposit insurance fund. More than a third of the industry's $60
billion in capital at the end of 1988 consisted of goodwill, which
becomes worthless when an S&amp;L closes.
   Q: Why do S&amp;L supporters believe the institutions should keep
their goodwill?
   A: Most S&amp;L goodwill is ``supervisory goodwill,'' meaning it was
approved by federal S&amp;L supervisors. Regulators OK'd the accounting
break for institutions willing to take failed S&amp;Ls off the
government's hands in the early 1980s, giving them as long as 40
years to write the goodwill off their books. S&amp;L executives complain
that the government shouldn't go back on its word.
   Q: What's the difference between normal goodwill and supervisory
goodwill?
   A: Goodwill usually is determined by what a willing buyer pays
for a business on the open market. However, supervisory goodwill is
the arbitrary amount assigned by regulators to make takeover deals
work. In this case, the goodwill actually represents a hidden loss
rather than something of value.
   Q: Why do critics of goodwill think it's worth going back on the
government's word?
   A: Critics acknowledge that many of the institutions operating
with goodwill are healthy in the sense that they are earning profits
and most of their loans are sound. But, they say the institutions
are dangerously vulnerable because the goodwill allows their owners
to operate with little or none of their own money at risk. That's a
situation ripe for abuse, critics argue, because those S&amp;Ls would
have little incentive to prevent them from speculating wildly with
depositors' money. Those looking to phase out goodwill say it's
better to be unfair to S&amp;L owners than to be unfair to the
taxpayers, who are picking up most of the 30-year, $285 billion bill
for the S&amp;L bailout.
   Q: What are some of the compromises proposed on the goodwill
issue?
   A: The bill passed by the House Banking Committee and endorsed by
the administration would phase out goodwill from tangible capital by
1995. Institutions short of capital because of goodwill would be
allowed to apply to regulators to avoid the stigma of a supervisory
agreement, but they would have to submit a business plan on how they
plan to raise capital.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wants to give S&amp;Ls with goodwill the
right to appeal its loss through administrative proceedings.
Critics, however, say that could delay tougher standards for up to
18 months.
   Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., would simply require regulators to
honor past agreements on goodwill and other legislators are
proposing variations.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Democratic Reform Movement Will Eventually Triumph</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan says he believes
the democratic reform movement in China will eventually triumph
despite the Beijing government's current military repression of the
movement.
   In an interview to be broadcast on the CBS ``Sunday Morning''
program, Reagan said he was ``optimistic'' about the long-term
prospects because ``what we're seeing now is what a lot of us have
known for many years _ that communism couldn't really be a
successful system.''
   Regarding the Chinese government, Reagan said: ``Those people
that are being hard-nosed right now, don't they have to think twice
about whether they want to take on the people in the street?''
   He indicated that the reform movement could not be simply stamped
out ``when the figures get into the millions,'' counting not just
the student protesters but their families as well.
   Reagan was asked by CBS' Charles Kuralt, ``Do you feel optimistic
enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win
some day?''
   The former president replied: ``Yes, I do, because this is
sweeping the communist world. Just look _ Poland the other day. The
first election in more than 30 years, and they voted against
communism.''

<HEAD>Frying Pan Blamed for Fire That Left Five Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An electric pan loaded with grease caught fire and
spread into a blaze that left five people dead and a 2-month-old
child critically injured in an apartment building, police said today.
   Police believe a resident's failure to shut off the frying pan
caused the fire Friday, Sgt. Leonard Sykes said. Earlier, Fire
Department officials said investigators found accelerants on two
stairways, indicating arson.
   Fire officials also found drug paraphernalia and said residents
were ``free-basing,'' or smoking cocaine, in one of the two
second-floor apartments that were destroyed in the three-story
building.
   The free-basing ignited some flames, but it did not appear to
have been the main cause of the fire, Battalion Chief William Foran
said Friday.
   ``You've got five people dead. It's time-consuming to figure out
what happened,'' said Detective Henry Ciolli.
   Police arrested one resident of the building, Renee Riddle, 34,
and charged her with possession of a controlled substance. Several
other people are believed to have escaped from the apartments, the
only ones destroyed in the 24-unit courtyard building.
   Firefighters found the second floor engulfed in flames when they
arrived at the building on the city's South Side Friday afternoon,
said department spokesman Scott La Greca. Rescue efforts were
hampered by security bars on the rear windows of one apartment,
Foran said.
   Dexter Moore, 2 months old, was hospitalized in very critical
condition with smoke inhalation and serious burns. Jesse Whitlow,
31, was listed in serious condition with burns and smoke inhalation.
   Those killed were identified as Laurie Mims, 24, Aretha Hill, 27,
and her three daughters, Melody, 10, Wendy, 2, and Ashley, 11 months
old.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Evacuates Americans From Tianjin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scores of Americans boarded U.S. Embassy
buses and vans from nearby Beijing to evacuate this port city
despite its relative calm after the military crushed the
pro-democracy movement in the capital.
   The convoy of three buses and two vans carried 89 foreigners,
mostly Americans, from the Sheraton Tianjin Hotel 75 miles northwest
to the Beijing airport, where many sought flights to Hong Kong and
Tokyo.
   Most of the evacuees were students, teachers, tourists and oil
field workers. Many said they were nervous about being so close to
Beijing, where hundreds of residents were killed last weekend when
troops entered Tiananmen Square to quell the student movement for
more freedom.
   But they said it had been quiet in Tianjin, the nation's
third-largest city with about 8 million people.
   ``This is the calmest city,'' said Chilin Shih, of Somerset,
N.J., who was in Tianjin for an international phonetics conference.
``But it only takes two hours for the troops to get here.''
   The section of Tianjin through which the convoy passed appeared
normal. There were no troops visible, buses were filled with
passengers and markets appeared well stocked.
   ``It's been very peaceful,'' said Ann Marie King, 38, of
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``I haven't felt threatened in any way in
Tianjin.''
   U.S. students living in Tianjin said there was a demonstration
last Sunday to protest the killings in Beijing but not much activity
since.
   ``It's been relatively quiet,'' said Philip Comeau, 23, of
Gardner, Mass. ``I think the students lost some of the enthusiasm
because of the deaths. They're a little scared now.''
   The convoy was arranged by the embassy after the U.S. State
Department recommended all Americans leave China following the
recent turmoil.
   The Americans sipped beer and wine in the hotel bar before filing
onto the buses shortly before 3 p.m. for the trip to Beijing. The
only delay came just outside Tianjin when the convoy stopped for a
regular passport check by police.
   U.S. diplomats said police were cooperative. When the convoy
entered Tianjin to pick up the foreigners, officers were stationed
at major intersections to point the vehicles toward the hotel.
   ``They made sure we didn't get lost,'' said Larry Wortzel, an
assistant army attache who led the convoy.
   The convoy provided the first opportunity for foreigners to
travel outside Beijing with government approval since the
confrontation in Tiananmen Square.
   No soldiers were visible during the 3{-hour trip. In the
countryside, peasants were seen harvesting wheat and others tending
neat vegetable plots.
   Young men lazily shot billiards at tables placed by the roadside
while old women sat talking beside the highway under trees.
   Brad Tonita of Calgary, Alberta, watched the scene from a van
window as he smoked American cigarettes and drank Chinese beer with
other oil workers who drove six hours from Shandong province to
Tianjin to join the evacuation.
   ``We feel it's time to get out before things get bad,'' he said.
``When things settle out, we'll be back.''

   Eighty years after Ernie Scott rode his
horse across the South Dakota Badlands and arrived late for his
wedding with Maud Seidler, they still disagree about what kept him.
   Ernie, 101, says he paused after getting the marriage license in
Pierre to see a jailed ax murderer. Maud, 97, says he stayed to
watch the hanging.
   Both agree he got back before dark, they married that evening on
June 16, 1909, and settled down in Nowlin _ a prairie town that no
longer exists.
   The anniversary this week of one of the world's longest marriages
will be a time for memories and visits Sunday from four generations
of descendants. The Guinness Book of World Records lists two 86-year
marriages, one beginning in 1753, the other in 1853, as the world's
longest, but doesn't list the current longest surviving couple.
   ``I think we're lucky to be married 80 years and still have our
complete family circle. That's kind of a record itself,'' Mrs. Scott
said.
   The Scotts, who have three daughters, 16 grandchildren, 48
great-grandchildren and 34 great-great-grandchildren, have led
quiet, honest, hardscrabble lives.
   They shared most of the 20th century living in Minnesota, South
Dakota, Georgia, Michigan, Indiana and California, with stops along
the way. They couldn't afford a honeymoon and never went any place
more exotic than Canada.
   ``Old Age Is Not For Sissies,'' reads an embroidered kitchen
wall-hanging.
   Ernie and Maud are no sissies, and the phrase on the wall
reflects their no-nonsense approach and the humor they say played a
big role in their marriage.
   ``I like funny things,'' she said. ``He used to come out with the
funniest expressions, and he was witty as could be. He's not that
way anymore.''
   Scott, hard of hearing and confined to a wheelchair, may not be
the quipster he was, but he's still sharp. He has a full head of
white hair, a strong voice and keen memory.
   ``All I thought about when I was younger was having a good
time,'' he said. ``I thought when you laughed and had a good time,
it added to your life. It did, I guess. Something kept me going.''
   Their youngest daughter, Gwen Crippen, 72, said one reason her
parents got along so well is that they often lived in different
places and couldn't hear each other much when they were together.
   ``It was always happy when they got together, but next thing Dad
would be off working someplace else,'' she said. ``He wasn't
satisfied. He was always looking.''
   Scott was born in Minnesota and picked corn as a youth. He became
a barber, charging 10 cents a shave and two bits a haircut, and says
he had a brief amateur boxing career at 18 and 19.
   ``I had about 200 bouts and I never was marked,'' he said
proudly, with nobody around to dispute him. ``I never got knocked
down. I never was hurt. They put my picture up in the (barber)
school. I had a smile on my face and they said, `It was the smile
you couldn't knock off.' I think I could box a little yet.''
   He farmed in South Dakota and played the fiddle at dances. But he
and his wife left the prairies during the Great Depression, when the
Dust Bowl took over the land.
   ``We was dried out and we was froze out,'' he said.
   Scott became a railroad car inspector in Gary, Ind. He returned
to Minnesota as a house mover, and worked in a Detroit factory
during World War II.
   When Mrs. Scott got sick in the cold of the North, she and the
kids moved to Atlanta and she worked as a hotel clerk.
   She met Babe Ruth when the New York Yankees stayed at the hotel,
but was disappointed that he was much shorter than she expected.
During World War II, she joined the Coast Guard, working aboard
Great Lakes boats.
   Mrs. Scott moved to California in 1951, but Scott stayed in
Minnesota and built houses, visiting during the winter. In 1965, he
retired and joined her.
   ``Nobody is always happy, but we had our share of good times,''
he said. ``You'd wonder where you're going to eat the next meal
sometimes, and you'd feel happy when you did. But we never went too
hungry.''
   Over the years, Mrs. Scott has gone through whole libraries of
books. The happiest time of her life was when she was in school. She
adds with a laugh, ``I wasn't married then.''
   She straightens slowly getting out of a chair.
   ``I must be getting old,'' she said.
   In the parlor is a photo of Ernie and Maud made before their
wedding. He was 6 feet tall _ 6 inches taller than now _ and
straight as a cornstalk, a handsome young farmer with bib overalls
and hair parted in the middle. She looked pretty in a long,
checkered frock.
   Her advice for young couples is, ``You have to go in with the
idea that you're going to stay together.''
   ``We've never done anything dramatic, never met any presidents
and never went to jail,'' Mrs. Scott said. ``But we've been a happy
family and had a happy time in life.
   ``I never blacked his eye once,'' she said, ``and he never
blacked mine. He might have wanted to, but he never did.''

   Six of eight convicts who escaped from a
maximum security prison after killing two guards remained at large
Saturday and police announced a $300,000 reward for information
leading to their arrest.
   Two convicts, both Turkish Kurds, were captured Thursday just
hours after the eight inmates overpowered guards and shot their way
out of the prison on this south Aegean island.
   Police mounted a massive search of the region and the
northeastern Crete coastline for the remaining six _ four Greeks, a
Briton and a Tanzanian.
   A police official said a $300,000 reward was offered for
information leading to capture of the men, who were serving time for
robbery, drug trafficking and other convictions.

   Shocked by antics at last year's Berkeley Ball and
threatened with a loss of royal patronage, organizers have banned
miniskirts for next month's charity event.
   And, just to make sure there are no more pictures of disheveled
young women in awkward clinches with drunken swains, only a single,
discreet photorapher selected by Buckingham Palace will be admitted.
   ``Last year's ball was simply awful,'' society hostess Sally
Farmiloe was quoted as saying in Saturday's Daily Mail.
   ``It was full of scrubbers (loose women), second-hand car dealers
and their bimbos. They were wearing leather jackets and tight
miniskirts, not evening wear at all, the sort of clothes you'd wear
to a barbecue.''
   This year's invitations prescribe gowns, ``minimum length below
midcalf.''
   Buckingham Palace let it be known that royal attendance might be
off unless the ball cleaned up its act.
   Organizers said Friday they have been assured that the dancers
will include the Duchess of York, familiarly known as Fergie, who is
patron of the Anastasia Trust for the Deaf. The ball is expected to
raise $160,000 for the charity.

   Hundreds of youths preparing for giant
political rallies by Greece's two major political parties clashed in
Salonica on Saturday, and police said at least 40 people were
injured.
   The clashes occurred before dawn as the youths belonging to the
governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement and the conservative New
Democracy Party were putting up posters in this northern city in
preparation for political rallies scheduled for Sunday and Monday
night.
   Both parties are reportedly busing in thousands of supporters in
a show of strength for the crucial June 18 national elections.
   Witnesses said the Socialist Movement youths destroyed two house
trailers and a campaign office used by the New Democrats.
   New Democracy youths reportedly retaliated by smashing the
windows of a Socialist Movement campaign bureau and attacked the
opposing youths with clubs.
   It took riot police two hours to restore calm. Police said at
least 40 people were injured, most slightly, by clubs and stones.

<HEAD>Local Projects Abound in $3 Billion Congressional Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the trees in Sims Park in Euclid, Ohio,
began toppling into Lake Erie, officials in the Cleveland suburb
turned to their congressman, Rep. Edward Feighan, for help.
   But when the Army Corps of Engineers proved reluctant to build
off-shore barriers to block the waves battering the park's
shoreline, Feighan chose the best way he knew to get the message
across that he wanted the job done.
   He composed a single paragraph stating that the Corps ``shall
undertake'' the project and inserted it into legislation Congress
hopes to complete this week rushing billions of dollars to veterans,
foster care providers and other programs running low in funds.
   ``This is a bill that is certain to see enactment in some form or
another,'' the Ohio Democrat said last week in explaining why his
provision ended up in the spending measure.
   Feighan was not alone. Dozens of lawmakers have sought to use the
spending measure as a way to get favorable treatment for local
projects, a Capitol Hill ritual with bills that are seen as
must-pass.
   The Senate approved a $3.3 billion version of the legislation
last Wednesday, two weeks after the House approved its own $3.7
billion measure. The money is for the rest of fiscal 1989, which
ends Sept. 30. Bargainers from the two chambers plan to try to work
out a compromise package next week and ship it to the White House
for President Bush's signature.
   But sprinkled into the so-called dire emergency spending bill are
provisions from senators and representatives calibrated to elicit
smiles back home.
   There is $75 million to rebuild a crumpled radio telescope in
Greenbank, W.Va., home state of the Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman, Democrat Robert Byrd.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is ordered to spend up to
$360,000 for aviation research it conducts with the University of
Minnesota in the district of Rep. Martin Olav Sabo. And Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., obtained $275,000 for Kansas State
University to help farmers cope with drought.
   The net worth of the special projects comes to just a small
fraction of the overall bill. But they come under fire from critics
who say they add to the federal deficit and show a visceral
inability by lawmakers to just say no to spending taxpayers' dollars.
   ``They're like a bunch of kids in the candy store,'' says Carol
Cox, president of The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,
the bipartisan group that advocates deficit reduction.
   Cox complains that when lawmakers from the two chambers hash out
their differences over the bill, few projects for the folks back
home are likely to drop out.
   ``They say, `I'll take yours if you take mine,''' she says.
   Lawmakers involved in the process take umbrage at such criticism.
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.,
says federal spending on local problems increases the national
wealth. And he concedes that the practice is so widespread that he
has so far received more than 3,500 requests from colleagues who
want special projects placed in next year's spending bills.
   ``They represent their districts,'' Whitten says of his fellow
legislators. ``They know what's there.''
   In an era of tight budgets, lawmakers have perfected several ways
of helping their districts without ordering new federal spending.
   Some provisions order federal agencies to set aside portions of
their budgets for particular projects. Thus, language by Wyoming GOP
Sens. Malcolm Wallop and Alan Simpson requires the U.S. Forest
Service to delve into its coffers for $400,000 for research into
last summer's forest fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   Other clauses command bureaucrats to do what Congress wants. That
is the case with Feighan's provision, which in effect orders the
Corps of Engineers to start a $1.7 million project it has so far
declined to undertake. The money was actually provided in
legislation two years ago.
   Still other sections subtly prod agencies to obey congressional
desires. The report accompanying the Senate's bill ``urges'' the
Department of Health and Human Services ``to give serious
consideration'' to hiring more workers in Honolulu. Departments
ignore such language at their own risk.
   Examples of local projects appended to the spending bill include:
   _$1 million to be divided among West Virginia, Maine, North
Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont to computerize their criminal records.
   _An extra $150,000 for work on an agricultural research center in
Lane, Okla.
   _Repeal of earlier legislation blocking the military from
changing its strength in Alaska. The Army once wanted to reduce its
forces in the state; it now wants to add a headquarters there.
   _Urging the Agriculture Department to buy more apples for school
breakfasts, thus helping an industry plagued by the Alar
controversy, introduced by Washington's two senators, Democrat Brock
Adams and Republican Slade Gorton.
   _$6.6 million to subsidize airlines serving small towns in 38
states and Puerto Rico.

   President Daniel arap Moi on Saturday
banned the brewing and drinking of homemade beer in Kenya, state
radio reported.
   ``I am not prepared to lead a drunken nation,'' the Voice of
Kenya quoted Moi as saying. ``From today, June 10, all brewing and
drinking of traditional beer, even during traditional ceremonies,
must cease.''
   Moi, a church-goer and a teetotaler, made the announcement at a
fund-raising event in Kericho, the headquarters of the tea-growing
region in western Kenya, 160 miles from Nairobi.
   In Kenya, various brands of traditional beer are made at home
from fermented honey, sugar cane, coconut, and grains such as corn,
millet and sorghum. Most people obtained a license from a
low-ranking official before making such beer, but others simply did
so without getting a permit.
   Homemade beer is a favorite drink among Kenyans, particularly in
the countryside, during social occasions such as weddings and
funerals.
   Moi did not mention other alcoholic beverages. Kenya manufactures
whiskey, vodka, gin, liquor, four commercial beers and small
quantities of fruit wines.

   Gene Kitt calls East Harlem ``one of the toughest
areas in the world. If crack isn't in your house, it's in the
hallway or on the corner.''
   Amid the drugs and despair, Kitt operates an oasis of learning
and fun: the Upward Fund, a not-for-profit organization that runs a
summer day camp and after school programs for 1,200 youngsters age 6
to 19.
   Upward Fund teachers and volunteers, working out of an East
Harlem elementary school, provide tutoring, job training, drug abuse
prevention, dance, sports and even lessons in manners.
   ``You play with a purpose _ to learn,'' says Kitt.
   In the gym, kids playing basketball are asked what the ball is
made of and how to spell it. A geography lesson sneaks in as the
children name the home cities of professional teams.
   In a room lined with computers, Danita Williams, 7, guides Snoopy
through a maze on her screen. ``I like playing outside, gym and
computers,'' she said. Her neighbor, Tommy Rumardo, 7, agreed.
   ``They love this program _ and they don't even know they're
learning,'' said Kitt.
   George Rivera, a single parent who works for a medical research
company, said his two sons are ``always kept busy here in a positive
way, with computers, arts and crafts, basketball. It doesn't give
them a chance to get into the wrong things _ the people on the
corner and the crack dealers.''
   ``Parents are struggling to save their children from the street,
and we want to help,'' said Kitt.
   For adults, there are literacy and English-as-a-second-language
classes. Youngsters 13 and up get job training, starting with dress
code and attitude.
   ``They need to know you can't just say, `Where's the man with the
job?''' said Kitt. ``And they should have not one career as a dream,
but five, in case some don't work out.''
   Anthony Carreras, 14, who enrolled in the Upward Fund at age 7,
said tutoring in math and reading ``helped me a lot when I was
younger.'' Now, he proudly says, he works after school in the Upward
Fund office.
   Joe Charles, 25, said the Upward Fund ``had a big impact on my
life.'' Kitt helped him get an internship at an insurance company
when he was 19, and he now works for the company full-time.
   In the summer camp, Kitt has each child take pictures using three
different cameras _ just to make sure a budding Ansel Adams doesn't
go undiscovered.
   Most Upward Fund children live below the poverty line and pay
only $3 a year to attend the after school program. Much of the
organization's $600,000 annual budget comes from corporate and
foundation donations.
   Kitt speaks proudly of starting an ice hockey program, and beams
as he tells how hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky and the L.A. Kings
once came to Harlem to play with the Upward Fund team.
   The program teaches mutual respect, too.
   ``Today, if a kid steps on another kid's toe, he's liable to
punch him in the face and go home and get three Uzis,'' Kitt said
referring to a type of machine gun. ``So we teach them manners.''

   Intelligence experts say they're not surprised
that President Bush admits he can't say for sure ``who's calling the
shots'' in China.
   ``Real time intelligence _ that is what is happening now _ is
almost impossible to come by,'' said one administration official.
   The official, who is familiar with the daily intelligence
briefings prepared by the Departments of State and Defense, the CIA
and other sources, said the president's comment that the situation
in China is ``very, very murky'' came directly from such reports.
   At one point, Bush even joked about the problem, saying he'd
called China's 84-ear-old leader Deng Xiaoping, but ``the line was
busy. I couldn't get through.''
   The reason U.S. officials have so little information about who
may or may not be in power at any given time, or who gave specific
orders for the savage attack on the pro-democracy demonstrators, is
quite simple, the experts say.
   ``There's no access. ... If they don't want to respond to the
president of the United States, they sure as hell aren't going to
respond to the ambassador,'' the administration official said.
   He, and others speaking on intelligence matters, spoke only on
condition that their names and exact titles not be used.
   China, which only began to open up during the past decade, has
traditionally posed a problem for foreigners seeking detailed
information.
   The leaders sequester themselves in special compounds and are not
seen unless they wish to be seen. They tend to keep their decisions
within a very tight circle, and for the most part, have had nearly
complete control over the mass media.
   The dearth of human intelligence _ that gleaned by personal
contact _ has been ``a big difficulty'' in the current unrest, the
administration official said.
   U.S. diplomats tend to be exposed to their counterparts who
``spout the party line'' in normal times, said another source
familiar with the diplomatic scene in Beijing.
   ``So when there is a undoubted conflict within the party,
government and top military leadership, they are especially careful
to keep it obscure from the rest of the world,'' said the diplomatic
source.
   During the past week, U.S. Ambassador James Lilley has met twice
with the vice foreign minister in Beijing, and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III has called the Chinese ambassador to the State
Department twice.
   Embassy officials have contacted officials from the Chinese
ministry of national defense, the ministry of education and the
civil aviation administration.
   Also, contacts have taken place with some Chinese military
officers who are personally acquainted with U.S. officials in
Beijing, and they have been providing some information. ``But it's
not very satisfactory,'' the administration official said.
   The official admitted with some frustration that ``we don't have
any feel for what is going on'' in what he called ``the dark
stretches'' of provincial China.
   The diplomatic source said the government has ``ample reports''
about the situation in Beijing. ``But there is an important
distinction between being able to observe what is going on the
outside and having access to the inner workings of the party and
government,'' he said.
   The administration official pointed out that information culled
from technical sources such as satellite photos or electronic
surveillance can only go so far in providing up-to-date information.
   ``Overhead photos ... pictures of troops massed and locations and
tanks, that isn't going to tell you who does what to whom'' during a
group-by-group or person-to-person struggle for political power,
said the official.
   Although he refused to specifically discuss electronic
surveillance, the official noted that the sheer volume of
information poses a problem.
   ``You have a whole mass of information to sort out ... it has to
translated, analyzed, and sometimes only after the fact ... do you
find something has happened,'' he said.
   One important source of information is the news media, and U.S.
officials freely admitted they had their eyes glued to the
round-the-clock coverage provided by the 24-hour Cable News Network.
   ``CNN has been one of the sturdy resources for information''
during the Beijing crackdown, the administration official said.
   ``We cannot presume to do without the information that the media
transmit,'' said another, calling the presence of the U.S.
television networks ``of tremendous importance.''
   The United States also cooperates with other foreign embassies in
China, but ``everybody's been somewhat embarrassed, really, at how
difficult and unsuccessful they've been in getting any
information,'' the administration official said. ``We're all in the
same boat.''
   Sometimes, the official said, expectations are just too high.
   ``It's a magic word _ people really think that `intelligence'
people are omniscient, but boy, they sure aren't,'' the official
said.

<TEXT>
   A onetime altar boy who escaped the
barrio to become a Harvard University student was convicted of
pulling six armed robberies during college vacations.
   Jose Luis Razo, 22, showed no emotion as he was convicted Friday
by an Orange County Superior Court jury.
   ``I think that none of us wanted to find him guilty,'' said juror
Dean Montanye. ``But there was just too much evidence on most of the
counts. And we couldn't get his excellent memory out of our minds.''
   The prosecution rested heavily on a videotaped confession in
which Razo recounted with vivid detail the holdups by a gunman in a
ski mask. Defense attorney John Barnett maintained it was a false
confession given in a stupor induced by the drug phencyclidine,
better known as PCP or angel dust.
   Jurors, who deliberated three days, acquitted Razo of four other
robbery counts, including two that he had confessed to. But they
also convicted him of trying to escape from police after his arrest
in 1987.
   He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years and four months in
prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 4.
   Razo was charged with committing 10 armed robberies between
December 1985 and June 1987. In the confession, Razo told detectives
he robbed fast-food restaurants, grocery stores, a dairy and a drug
store.
   Razo testified that he confessed to the robberies in a
drug-driven schizophrenic episode, describing crimes actually
committed by a friend and drug dealer, Richard Longoria.
   When Deputy District Attorney Ravi Mehta pointed out that the
friend was in jail during three of the robberies, Razo's lawyer
suggested those holdups were committed by his client's younger
brother, Albert.
   Razo, a product of a poor La Habra neighborhood was an altar boy
and Boys Club ``Boy of the Year,'' and an ``A'' student at his Roman
Catholic high school. A standout prep football player, he was wooed
by more than 60 colleges when he graduated.
   He chose a scholarship to Harvard, where just 4.7 percent of the
student body is Hispanic. As a freshman in 1985, he decided to major
in psychology.
   ``He always said, `Look how good I'm doing. I'm Mexican. I'm
trying to make it in a white world,''' his sister, Martha, once told
an interviewer.
   But in a jail interview right after his confession and arrest in
July 1987, he said: ``At Harvard, I didn't fit. I'm a homeboy now.''

   Students whose stubborn calls for democracy
brought a military crackdown that left hundreds dead said Saturday
they were still trying to understand what happened and ride out a
campaign of political repression.
   ``I'm just trying to leave the country,'' one Beijing University
student said gloomily. ``For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put
up with governments like this. It will take a long time to change.''
   The mood of confusion and frustration on Beijing college campuses
contrasted sharply with the spirit one week ago, when most students
were confident the government would have to bend to their demand for
dialogue.
   Then came last weekend's military assault on student protesters
in Tiananmen Square in which nearly 300 people were killed by
official count and as many as 3,000 by unofficial count.
   Student leaders went into hiding. Thousands of others fled home.
The few who remained on campuses seemed in shock. All said they
still wanted democratic change in China, and several said they would
fight the government from underground.
   ``This government cannot last long. ... The people will rise up
and a leader will emerge,'' said a math student at Beijing
University.
   But even the defiant ones acknowledged they had no idea how to
put their ideas into action.
   ``Right now is not the time,'' the math student said. ``Maybe in
a few months.'' He paused and thought. ``But maybe students will
just go back to school in September and it will stay quiet. Who
knows?''
   ``I don't think the ordinary people can do anything,'' said a
woman at Beijing Normal University. ``Change can't come from below,
it has to come from above. We have to wait until the Communist Party
decides to change itself. The leaders aren't concerned for the good
of the people _ all they think about is holding onto power.''
   By week's end, the government intensified political repression,
which included arrests of protest leaders and a propaganda campaign
against the students in the state-run media.
   The government announced Saturday that several student leaders
were arrested, including Gua Haifeng, the secretary of the United
Association of Beijing Universities, the independent student group
that led the seven weeks of protests in Tiananmen Square.
   It said 12 people were arrested at Beijing University and charged
with stealing, but that they were not students of the school.
Authorities ripped down protest posters and soldiers patrolled the
university district in northwestern Beijing, but only one person
reported seeing uniformed soldiers enter a campus, and then only
briefly.
   The sprawling, tree-covered campuses of Beijing University and
Beijing Normal University have become shady havens for about 1,000
students each, or about one-tenth the normal student population.
   School officials declared an early start to summer vacation,
which normally would have begun in two weeks.
   Most who remained on campus were seniors who said they were
waiting to receive diplomas and government job assignments. Others
said they were waiting for rail service to return to normal so they
could go home.
   They worked on senior theses, read novels, played ping-pong and
basketball and shuffled around their gloomy, hushed dormitory halls,
anxiously watching political developments.
   ``Certainly there will be a serious political campaign of
denunciation,'' said the woman at Beijing Normal University. ``Maybe
many intellectuals will be arrested.''
   The official media began to carry a steady stream of reports
denying that soldiers killed unarmed civilians and highlighting
civilian attacks on soldiers.
   ``Whenever there is so much propaganda, who can believe it?'' a
woman student at Beijing University said scornfully.
   But other students worried that people outside Beijing who did
not see the soldiers' violent attack would believe government
denials.
   ``Most Chinese are peasants. They believe what the government
says _ they want to believe,'' said another Beijing University
student. ``They don't want to believe foreign news reports.''
   Even the students had trouble understanding the attack.
   ``No one thought the soldiers would fire,'' many said.
   Amid the confusion, frustration and resignation predominated.
   ``Nothing can be done now. What good would it be to demonstrate?
The government has shown it doesn't care,'' said a student from the
northwestern city of Xian.
   Many of the protests were directed against Senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, 84, and Premier Li Peng, 60, who imposed martial law.
   ``Deng Xiaoping may die soon, but we will still have to wait for
Li Peng to die, and that will take a long time,'' said the woman
from Beijing Normal University.
   Forget about politics, she advised: ``We should just try to enjoy
life.''

<HEAD>Convention Creates an Odd Couple: Las Vegas, Southern Baptists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sin City is about to meet its Maker.
   The first contingents of up to 18,000 Southern Baptists began
arriving this weekend for an ``evangelistic blitz'' in the nation's
gambling capital. They hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens
of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual
convention.
   ``I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you
make lemonade,'' said John B. Wright, a convention organizer.
   Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and
swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists.
   ``We want all the conventions we can get and we don't give a damn
who they are,'' said John Reible, a spokesman for the Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce.
   The site represents a marriage of convenience for Southern
Baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn.
   The 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has more than
doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the United
Methodist Church as the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
Las Vegas, a desert town of 5,600 little more than five decades ago,
is growing at the rate of 3,000 people a month and there are now
about 700,000 people in the region.
   Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the
hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention,
said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.
   ``It just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation
of the people of Las Vegas to come,'' he said. There are about
22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in Nevada.
   Six years after the denomination voted to meet in Las Vegas, the
decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have
decided to stay home.
   While conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45,000
people, estimates for the convention running Tuesday through
Thursday range from 13,000 to 18,000.
   Reasons include the reluctance of Southern Baptists to expose
their children to the gambling scene, the city's remoteness from the
denomination's strongholds in the Southeast and an apparent lack of
burning issues as the struggle between the denomination's moderates
and conservatives stretches into its 11th year.
   Southern Baptists leaders say Las Vegas offers an opportunity to
put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism.
   ``The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern
Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in
Las Vegas,'' said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern
Baptist Alliance, a moderate group.
   A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign
Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock
on doors around Las Vegas.
   To keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin,
convention President Jerry Vines said he is seeking postponement of
a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a Religious
Liberty Commission. The commission would lobby Congress on issues
such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for
tuition paid to parochial schools.
   Church leaders said the internal struggle has taken a toll on the
evangelistic efforts of the denomination, where membership has
increased barely more than half a percent in each of the last two
years.
   ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,'' said
Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists.
   On Wednesday, the conference plans to lead thousands of Southern
Baptists down the gambling Strip to distribute 10,000 New Testaments
and 20,000 gospel tracts, Strack said.
   Las Vegas officials and some church leaders say the city
variously known over the years as Sin City, Sin City West and Lost
Wages is undeserving of special attention.
   ``Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities
than any other city,'' Hastey said.
   Robert Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority, said life in the residential areas outside the
Strip is little different from anywhere else.
   In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the
Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers
said.
   ``I think it's good for the city that a group like this is
meeting here,'' he said.

   The government has switched from gunfire to
propaganda and intimidation following its assault on the
pro-democracy movement.
   Chinese citizens, who have seen the signs before, face what could
be the worst state backlash against free thought since the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   Already, Chinese sources say police are arresting intellectuals
who supported the seven-week-long student movement. Authorities
announced Saturday that 400 people, including student leaders, had
been rounded up for agitation.
   Hundreds of people in cities outside Beijing also have been
arrested in the unrest following last Sunday's military attack in
Beijing that left up to 3,000 people dead.
   Student leaders who demanded democratic reforms, press freedom
and an end to government corruption have been branded as
counterrevolutionaries and told to turn themselves in.
   Activists charged with the same crime after the ``Democracy
Wall'' movement of 1978-79 were imprisoned for up to 15 years.
   Many Chinese intellectuals, usually the first to suffer when the
Communist Party asserts its authority, have gone underground.
   Some student leaders also are in hiding; a few are believed to
have fled to embassies. Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident, is
sheltered at the U.S. Embassy.
   ``We now live in terror,'' said one student.
   Show trials, like the one for Mao Tse-tung's widow, Jiang Qing,
and her leftist Gang of Four after the Cultural Revolution are a
possibility. Executions of some people accused of attacking police
or soldiers seem certain.
   However, relatively few leading dissidents may face criminal
charges. Instead, they could be suppressed in a more subtle campaign
of fear and reprisal that also would affect the lives of millions of
Chinese.
   Workers already have been docked pay and threatened with
dismissal for participating in demonstrations.
   The government has begun a massive propaganda campaign to drum
home the belief that the military carried out the will of the masses
in attacking unarmed protesters. The official press insists that not
one shot was fired when troops stormed Tiananmen Square in Beijing
last Sunday.
   Thousands of reporters had joined the students in calling for
press freedom. For one heady moment, they were permitted to print
what they saw as the truth.
   Now, the press is once again a conduit for official
pronouncements.
   One Chinese reporter expressed surprise when a foreigner asked
for a copy of the party's People's Daily. ``There's no news in it,''
he said.
   Repression of free thought has been a fixture of communist rule
in China.
   In 1957, leader Mao Tse-tung lured critics into the open with the
slogan: ``Let 100 flowers bloom; let 100 schools of thought
contend.'' Within months, he banished thousands of freethinkers to
prison and re-education camps.
   Many victims eventually returned to their lives, only to be
caught up in the orgy of violence of the Cultural Revolution. People
were persecuted for their intellectual background, their work with a
foreign company, speaking a foreign language or traveling abroad.
   Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of China, is itself no
stranger to government repression. In 1976, security forces stormed
the square and killed about 100 people protesting an attempt by
Mao's wife and other leftists to seize power.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, himself disgraced during the
Cultural Revolution, took power in the late 1970s. He promised then
that ideological struggles would no longer interfere with China's
urgent need to fight poverty and modernize.
   Last week was not the first time Deng has used force, however.
   When Democracy Wall leaders began to question one-party rule in
their daring posters, Deng imprisoned dozens of people.
   He responded to pro-democracy student demonstrations 2{ years ago
by purging party chief Hu Yaobang, a reformer and his designated
successor. Hu's death in April touched off the new round of protests.
   Despite his oft-quoted remark that China will have to let in a
few flies when it opens its windows to the world, he stands firmly
against what he calls ``spiritual pollution'' from the West.
   Deng and other old-guard conservatives who back him also share a
deep-seated phobia of political unrest.
   Still, the Chinese people returned this spring to reassert their
demands for greater freedom. They are bound to do so again after
this new crisis.

   Fourteen sailors suffered
smoke inhalation when a Navy helicopter carrier caught fire in port,
but there was no serious damage to the ship.
   The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter
carrier, caught fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said.
   The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where
a cable from the shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of
the fire was not known, but an investigation was under way.
   The damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke
inhalation were treated and returned to onboard duty by Saturday
morning, Chesser said.
   The fire was put out by approximately 10:30 p.m., less then 20
minutes after it was discovered, and repairs to the ship will be
made by the crew.
   The Peleliu had recently returned from operations, but Chesser
did not know the nature of the assignment. The ship normally has a
crew of 900.
   Long Beach is located 20 miles southwest of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Community Grieving Over Mysterious Deaths of Three Florida Vacationers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stunned villagers said a woman and her two
daughters found drowned in Florida's Tampa Bay, bound to cinder
blocks, were part of a hard-working farm family.
   ``Everybody is shocked,'' said Susan Reynolds, 19, a waitress at
the Village Restaurant, a popular place in the northwestern Ohio
community of about 500 people. ``No one could believe it. It's not
that it couldn't happen to somebody in a small town. The reality is
that it did.''
   The bodies of Joan M. Rogers, 36, and her daughters, Michelle,
17, and Christie, 14, were identified from dental records Friday,
five days after they were found in the bay _ gagged, with hands
bound and tied to cinder blocks, police said. All were naked from
the waist down.
   Police said they had no leads and no suspects. They speculated
that the three may have been thrown into the water alive because the
bodies showed no sign of trauma, such as shooting or stab wounds.
   St. Petersburg police were deluged with telephone tips Saturday,
but there was ``nothing hot,'' said Detective M. Mahoney. ``We're
getting hundreds of calls, but we won't know until we check them
out,'' he said.
   Mahoney said a published reference to a blue-and-white boat
possibly linked to the crime spurred most of the calls. ``That
boat's been seen from Jacksonville to Key West,'' Mahoney said,
noting that many pleasure boats fit that description.
   The victims had been vacationing in the Walt Disney World area
and were on the way home when they stopped in Tampa on June 1, said
St. Petersburg police spokesman Wendall Creager.
   Mrs. Rogers' husband, Hal, who had stayed home to tend the
family's dairy farm, reported his wife and daughters missing June 4
when they failed to return.
   Ms. Reynolds said Hal and Joan Rogers often came into the
restaurant to eat breakfast.
   ``They always looked happy but tired,'' she said. ``You could see
that the hard work took its toll on them. It's just so sad what
happened.''
   ``This grief is forever, a scar no one can remove,'' said the
Rev. Gary Luderman of Zion Lutheran Church, the family's pastor.
   ``This is a small, tight-knit community. Everybody knows
everybody. We're an extended family and when one person hurts, we
all hurt.''
   He said special services and counseling might be offered,
particularly for young friends of the victims, to help them come to
terms with their grief.
   Michelle would have been a high school senior this fall in
Convoy, where she was a member of Future Farmers of America, school
officials said. Christie, who was about to start her freshman year
in high school, was a cheerleader, 4-H member and marching band
member.
   Rogers' 31-year-old brother, John F. Rogers, is in prison on a
sexual assault charge. A second charge against him relating to an
alleged assault against Michelle was dropped in a plea agreement.
Luderman said some residents wonder if the killings and the assault
case are linked, though authorities in Florida are discounting the
notion.
   ``Some of the rumors are ridiculous,'' Luderman said. ``We are
trying to stop them.''

<HEAD>Visit to El Salvador Intended as Show of Support for New President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, embarking Sunday on
a trip to Central America, will confer with Salvadoran government
and rebel leaders in a climate of escalating violence that threatens
the strife-riddled country's new administration.
   Quayle's four-day trip is designed in part to show support for El
Salvador's new rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, whose top
adviser was gunned down by assassins on Friday, barely a week after
Cristiani took office.
   In addition to his talks with Cristiani, Quayle will meet with
non-fighting rebel leaders closely allied with the leftist
guerrillas, most likely Ruben Zamora and Guillermo Ungo, as well as
other opposition politicians and the country's military leaders, his
office said.
   Elsewhere on the trip, U.S. concerns about Panama and Nicaragua
will be high on the agenda during Quayle's stops in Guatemala,
Honduras, and Costa Rica. He plans to meet with the presidents and
other leaders in those countries and also will visit combatants and
officials of the Contra movement that has been fighting Nicaragua's
Sandinista government.
   Quayle will arrive in El Salvador just days after Cristiani's top
cabinet minister, Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, and two bodyguards
were shot down in a blaze of gunfire. Cristiani blamed the killings
on the guerrillas, who are organized under the umbrella group
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The White House, condemning the shooting as vicious and
despicable murder, said Quayle will deliver President Bush's
condolences to the Rodriguez family and Cristiani.
   Quayle called it ``an attempt to kill not only a man, but
democracy.''
   During his trip, Quayle also will try to spur the Latin nations
into a new plan to bolster thus-far futile efforts to depose
Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega, and step up pressure against the
leftist Nicaraguan government, said his press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   The vice president will sound out reaction in the region to
further U.S. action against Panama if an Organization of American
States effort fails in its mission to mediate a transfer of power in
Panama, the press secretary said.
   The United States supports the OAS mediation team that last week
was given an additional six weeks to resolve the Panama stalemate.
The team's initial foray failed to budge Noriega from power after he
invalidated results from the election last month that was widely
seen as rigged by Noriega.
   The administration last week blasted Nicaragua for sending
weapons to Panama for use against a potential U.S. military attack.
   The State Department also accused the Sandinistas last week of
denying the opposition fair representation in the all-powerful
tribunal that will oversee next year's elections.
   Quayle will be seeking Latin support for U.S. condemnation of
what officials say is a continuing pattern of Nicaraguan arms
shipments to El Salvador's leftist rebels.
   In El Salvador, Quayle is expected to convey a more positive tone
than the stern lecture he delivered to military leaders in February.
Then he warned that El Salvador risked cut off of its more than $1
million-per-day in U.S. aid unless it made progress on human rights
and a quashing of death squad activity.
   U.S. officials say they are pleased so far with Cristiani's young
government. But Quayle will underscore the need to maintain
scrupulous human rights standards in the face of increasing scrutiny
by congressional and other critics who fear the ascension of
Cristiani's Arena party heralds a new open season for death squads.
   The rebels have pledged to make the country ungovernable under
Arena, and Cristiani's political opponents say the polarization they
foresaw under Arena governance has begun.

<HEAD>Former President Optimistic Over Change ``Sweeping the Communist
World''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan says he believes the
democratic reform movement in China will eventually emerge
victorious despite the Beijing government's current crackdown
against the movement.
   In an interview to be broadcast on the CBS ``Sunday Morning''
program, Reagan said he was ``optimistic'' about the long-term
prospects because ``what we're seeing now is what a lot of us have
known for many years _ that communism couldn't really be a
successful system.''
   Reagan also said the leadership in China, like Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, faces its most serious challenge from
hard-liners within the ruling Communist Party Politburo.
   In the Soviet Union, ``he (Gorbachev) came in and found he'd
inherited an economic basket case, so he knows that his opposition
is going to be behind him. Not the people out in front of him. It's
going to be that Politburo. Well, the same thing in China,'' Reagan
said.
   Regarding the Chinese government, Reagan said: ``Those people
that are being hard-nosed right now, don't they have to think twice
about whether they want to take on the people in the street?''
   He indicated that the reform movement could not be simply stamped
out ``when the figures get into the millions,'' counting not just
the student protesters but their families as well.
   Reagan was asked by CBS' Charles Kuralt, ``Do you feel optimistic
enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win
some day?''
   The former president replied: ``Yes, I do, because this is
sweeping the communist world. Just look _ Poland the other day. The
first election in more than 30 years, and they voted against
communism.''
   Reagan, interviewed in Los Angeles, was asked about his feelings
on the May 5 conviction of fired National Security Council aide
Oliver North on three charges _ aiding and abetting obstruction of
Congress, destroying government documents and taking an illegal
gratuity _ in the Iran-Contra affair.
   North was acquitted on nine other counts, including false
statements to Congress, obstruction of a presidential inquiry,
conversion of traveler's checks to personal use and conspiracy to
defraud the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service.
   Reagan said about the verdict: ``I was not disappointed in the
fact that nine of the charges were dropped.''
   But he said he was ``handicapped'' in making any substantive
comment because North is now appealing the conviction.
   ``That is before the courts and I don't want to say anything that
is out of line. Besides which, I have a handicap around this whole
thing. It has been falsely portrayed in most of the press, the whole
Iran-Contra situation. It has been portrayed as if we were trading
arms for hostages with the government of Iran, as it was then,''
Reagan said.

   With names like Sub-Human, Project SQUID,
Gossamer Albacore and Speed Stick for their ocean-going inventions,
it may seem that entrants in the national human-powered submarine
races take the whole thing lightly.
   But competition promises to be fierce when 19 teams from
universities and corporations around the country gather June 23 to
25 for the race sponsored by the H.A. Perry Foundation for undersea
research.
   Made of lightweight materials, most of the subs will be propelled
by humans pedaling bicycle drive trains. One sub is arm-powered and
another works with a push-pull operation.
   Two-member dive teams wearing scuba gear in their flooded, but
sealed, submarines must maneuver around a mile-long, kidney-shaped
course in ocean water that is about 23 feet deep in this inaugural
race.
   Teams will be rated on speed, of course, but also such other
factors as cost efficiency and design innovation.
   Ocean engineering majors at Florida Atlantic University are
putting the finishing touches on their entry, the FAUtilus.
   ``From what we saw out there when we were on the course, it's
going to be difficult to get the submarines out and running,'' said
FAU team leader Brent Hoelzer. The lightweight subs will have to
maneuver in the strong surf at nearby Singer Island.
   He coordinated design of a 12-foot, cigar-shaped submarine with
the lowest volume and surface area _ features that he believes will
lead the student project to victory in the 15- to 20-minute race.
   But that's what the other teams think, too.
   ``Everybody's going to win. You talk to the guys at MIT
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and they're fastest. They
won't even think about anybody else winning. The guys at the Naval
Academy are the same way,'' said Maggie Linskey Merrill, foundation
director and race coordinator.
   Hoelzer openly frets about reports that the Gossamer Albacore
entry by Lockheed Advanced Marine Systems of San Diego was built for
speed with the help of 15 engineers, and that Navy brainpower was
borrowed by Naval Academy midshipmen for their teardrop-shaped
Project SQUID, short for Submerged Quick Intervention Device.
   ``Oh, good. We got them worried,'' said Gordon Isomura,
Lockheed's manager of engineering programs. But he acknowledged his
team ran into trouble running its torpedo-shaped sub in murky waters.
   ``In our bay, where we were trying to run, we couldn't see five
feet in front of us,'' said Isomura. ``We couldn't even see what
direction we were heading. We're running into problems, too. That'll
make them happy.''
   Hoelzer believes he has the advantage of early sea trials because
the FAU sub took a nosedive into mud, capsized a canoe and broke
essential parts at a time when mistakes were expected and adaptation
was possible.
   The top prize is $5,000.
   ``There's going to be schools against corporations, schools with
sweat equity up against corporations with supercomputers,'' said
Linskey Merrill. ``If there's a guy whose vehicle is very, very fast
who spent tons and tons of money on it, he may not win the whole
prize.''
   Various cash and trophy prizes also will recognize the team with
the most flair and flamboyance and the team that shows the best
sportsmanship and fortitude, she said.
   Cal Gongwer, a 73-year-old inventor whose Innerspace Corp. of
Covina, Calif., manufactures propulsion systems for remote-control
robot subs, is pushing his Knuckle Ball as an innovator. The round
ball with wings on the bottom is 5 feet in diameter and made of
transparent plastic.
   The engine of choice seems to be a scuba-diving bicyclist. Both
of FAU's pilots are women who are compact enough to fit in the
2-foot-wide, 3-foot-tall chamber.
   The Knuckle Ball is arm-powered, ``just for the heck of it,''
said Gongwer's son Bob, a retired physician and project participant.
   Lockheed is using a rowing machine-type, push-pull propulsion
method with the human engine lying face down. The FAU pedaler will
sit with legs outstretched facing aft. The MIT power source will be
lying on his back, facing forward.
   The rules ban electronic controls and emphasize safety as the top
priority.
   ``There are developments that will come out of this that will
contribute to enhancement in the field of underwater vehicles,
submersibles, for uses that would include commercial uses, for
research applications and for military applications,'' said Linskey
Merrill. ``Whether there is an industry out there waiting to produce
human-powered submarines for the commercial market, I don't know.''

   Pope John Paul II wound up his Scandinavian tour
Saturday by calling on the region's tiny Roman Catholic flock to
unite in a battle for human rights and social justice.
   The pope flew back to Italy after celebrating Mass at Vadstena,
site of the relics of Sweden's patron saint, Birgitta. He arrived in
Rome late Saturday afternoon on a special Alitalia DC-9.
   The pope said his last Mass of the trip under a drizzle at a 16th
century castle built during the reign of King Gustav Vasa when the
Protestant Reformation swept Scandinavia.
   It was attended by 2,500 youths from Norway, Iceland, Finland,
Denmark and Sweden, the nations the pope visited on the trip.
   Earlier, in Linkoping, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson praised the
Catholic Church's struggle against poverty in such areas as Brazil,
Central America and South Africa. He said the pope was welcomed in
Sweden by all faiths, as well as by non-believers who valued John
Paul's efforts to advance human rights.
   The main goals of the pope's visit were to meet with Scandinavian
Catholics, less than 1 percent of the population, and to work toward
better relations with the dominant Lutheran Church.
   As the pope approached his plane on Saturday, he left the red
carpet, walked over to a group of wheelchair-bound people and laid
his hands on their heads.
   In Vadstena, John Paul reiterated a main theme of his 10-day tour
of the five affluent, overwhelmingly Lutheran countries. He reminded
the youths that ``a high standard of living does not automatically
bring happiness and inner peace.''
   John Paul called on them to pursue justice and to proclaim human
dignity for all people.
   ``There is no room for selfishness or apathy in your lives,'' he
said.
   During his visit, the pope challenged the sexual and family mores
of Scandinavia, speaking out against abortion and divorce.
   Before leaving, he blessed the foundation stone for a new
Catholic church in Linkoping. The stone was a gift from the city's
Lutheran Diocese.
   ``This noble gesture recalls our common heritage ... in spite of
our historical divisions, we are sincerely striving to respond to
God's grace and build up together what was once torn apart,'' John
Paul said.
   He urged all Swedes to ``persevere in the great religious
traditions and values that are at the source of your national
identity.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the tour ``exceeded
expectations, both in the holy father's spiritual encounters with
the Catholic minorities and his ecumenical reception by leaders of
the Lutheran Church.''

   Burma, which closed its public schools
during a student-led uprising last year, will begin reopening them
soon.
   The spokesman for Burma's ruling military council, Col. Aung
Thein, told reporters Friday that primary schools will open June 19
``followed by the reopening of middle schools and high schools.''
   He did not say if universities would be allowed to reopen. They
were the focal point of the uprising from March to September in 1988.
   Thousands of protesters were killed in a series of harsh
crackdowns on dissent before the army finally re-established control
on Sept. 18.
   Aung said attendance at the nation's public schools will not be
compulsory. He also warned that student activism will not be
tolerated.

   Pieter Lieftinck, a former Dutch
finance minister and top official of the International Monetary
Fund, died Saturday of heart failure. He was 86.
   Lieftinck died suddenly at his Hague home, said a relative, who
spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Lieftinck, who was born on Sept. 30, 1902, became a lifelong
member of the Dutch Labor Party.
   He devoted his life to monetary and tax reform and served as a
delegate to the World Bank and the IMF in Washington from 1956 to
1976.
   He was finance minister from 1945-1952 and oversaw the financial
side of the Netherlands' recovery from the destruction of World War
II.
   During his stint as finance minister, Lieftinck implemented
far-reaching monetary reforms, steep tax hikes to finance the
nation's emerging welfare state and the nationalizing of De
Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank.
   Before the war, Lieftinck was a professor of economics in
Rotterdam.

   Kurdish rebels on Saturday accused Iraq of
razing several towns and forcibly relocating 19,000 people in a
drive to stamp out the Kurdish identity and carve a security zone
along the Iranian border.
   Diplomats and other sources in Iraq say the government already
has moved up to 500,000 Kurds and destroyed about 3,000 villages in
a major relocation effort over the past few years. They say it is
aimed at cutting off the rebels from sympathizers and breaking up
the tight-knit Kurdish clan system.
   Iraq acknowledges relocating people but denies forcing residents
to leave.
   A Kurdish official speaking in northern Iraq's city of Arbil said
Saturday that Kurds in the region have suffered ``long years of
backwardness,'' and that the resettlement is ``a non-political and
non-partisan issue.''
   Ahmed Abdul Qader Al-Naqshabandi, who heads the Legislative
Council of the autonomous region, said in an interview that the
relocation is ``only a communal program aimed at uplifting economic
and social standards of villagers.''
   Rebels refuse to join the council, which was elected on the basis
of 1974 agreement for limited autonomy for Kurds, and consider its
members pro-Iraqi.
   ``The Iraqis are pressing ahead with their mass deportation plan,
and they're getting away with it,'' said a spokesman for the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a leading rebel group. ``We'd hoped
that Western government pressure would prevent this happening, but
it hasn't.''
   The rebel spokesman spoke in a telephone interview from London,
where Kurdish leaders are seeking international support. He demanded
anonymity.
   According to reports from the Kurdistan region of Iraq,
government forces dynamited about 2,400 homes in the towns of
Twosuram and Sengeser and the nearby villages of Qadirawa,
Madhobizinan, Soorkanh, Gelk and Mankan, the spokesman said. He said
they first forcibly evacuated about 13,000 people to settlements
near the ancient city of Erbil, 60 miles to the west.
   The evacuated area is seven miles northwest of Qala Diza. Some
reports say that city's population of about 200,000 Kurds also is
being relocated.
   Kurdish rebel officials said last week that Iraqi tanks had moved
into Qala Diza, 15 miles west of the Iranian frontier, to enforce
the evacuations.
   The rebel spokesman said some residents barricaded themselves in
their homes and called a general strike in an unsuccessful effort to
resist. It was not known if there were casualties.
   The rebel spokesman also said troops evacuated the 6,000
residents of Dagalah last week.
   There was no immediate confirmation of his claims.
   He said Iraq was trying to create a 50-mile-wide security zone
along its border with Iran and that it hoped to ``destroy the
Kurdish identity.''
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been battling for an independent
homeland for decades. The Kurdish rebels sided with Iran during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   A short time before both countries agreed to a cease-fire last
August, the Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of
Halabja, killing an estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim
thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last
fall.
   Since the cease-fire went into effect, the Iraqis have stepped up
their campaign against the Kurds, the rebels charge.
   The rebel spokesman said Iraqis have destroyed 19 religious
centers and shrines in the region ``to eliminate any reason for
Kurds to return on pilgrimages.''

   Thousands of radical students battled
riot police with rocks, clubs and firebombs in street clashes
Saturday to demand the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and the
expulsion of U.S. troops.
   Police arrested more than 1,000 people in the confrontations,
which came on the second anniversary of the start of the June 1987
riots that brought down the authoritarian regime of former president
Chun Doo-hwan.
   Opposition groups denounced Roh for deciding not to hold a
promised referendum on his presidency and demanded he go ahead with
the vote.
   Violence broke out in central Seoul when students hurled rocks
and bricks at riot police who tried to stop protest marches. Police
fired volleys of tear gas and made baton charges to disperse
protesters. Saturday afternoon shoppers ran for cover.
   Students yelled, ``Crush the Roh Tae-woo regime'' and ``Yankee go
home.'' Police officials said more than 1,000 protesters were
arrested and that there were dozens of minor injuries on both sides.
One police commander said up to 5,000 people took part in the
protests, the worst in Seoul since labor and student protests in
late April.
   The government deployed 20,000 riot police to block protests.
Thousands of troops in combat fatigues and visored helmets guarded
downtown and key government buildings. About 20 busloads of riot
police ringed the U.S. Embassy.
   Protests began earlier Saturday when riot police blocked
demonstrations at two colleges by about 2,000 radical students
demanding to be allowed to attend a youth festival next month in
communist North Korea.
   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend the
athletic and cultural event, which mainly draws participants from
non-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the north
of attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoul
government.
   About 1,500 students battled riot police with clubs and rocks at
Yonsei University when troops blocked them from marching off the
campus. About 500 protesters at nearby Sogang University fought
police with firebombs and rocks.
   Thousands of students then gathered in the city center, where
more fighting broke out as protesters called for Roh's resignation.
   Student leaders denounced Roh and the United States, charging
they keep the Korean peninsula divided. They called for unification
with communist North Korea and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea.
   The two Koreas are bitter rivals and have clashed frequently over
the years. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean
War.
   South Korea's radical students and dissidents lack public support
because of their extremist views and violent tactics.
   Opposition groups issued statements Saturday denouncing Roh for
announcing on Thursday that he will not hold a promised referendum
on his performance. Roh promised the vote during the 1987
presidential election campaign.
   Roh said he decided to forego a vote because it would create
unrest. A defeat in a referendum would discredit Roh and put
pressure on him to resign.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, said Roh had to hold a referendum or the opposition would
be forced to mount an anti-government campaign. ``We cannot but
fight ... if Roh intends to avoid the interim appraisal,'' Kim said.
   About 250 students and dissidents Saturday ended an
anti-government hunger strike at Seoul's Roman Catholic cathedral.
Protesters, who had been fasting since May 25, took part in a
candlelight vigil as hundreds of riot police ringed the cathedral.
The officers did not intervene.

   The Voice of America on Saturday rejected a
complaint from the Chinese Communist Party, which criticized the
broadcast service for carrying a report that 3,000 residents died
during the crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``The VOA checks its information prior to broadcast to be sure
the facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released by VOA news
director Philomena Jurey.
   The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, accused the
U.S. government-backed VOA of being ``irresponsible'' in its
reporting. The newspaper said the U.S. broadcast was aimed at
instigating hatred and resistance.
   At the State Department, an official who spoke on condition he
not be identified noted that there have been ``many credible
reports'' of civilian deaths in last week's disturbances.
   Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatally
shot along the road and in the square, and U.S. intelligence reports
have estimated the death toll at about 3,000.
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in the
Federal Republic, a Chinese group in West Germany.
   Radio Beijing carried a report Saturday that claimed that in the
process of clearing out Tiananmen Square, ``the Liberation Army did
not fire even once at the crowd of people.''
   The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault,
and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters.
   In response to the turmoil in China, the VOA added three
additional hours of radio broadcasts in Mandarin, bringing to 11
hours the amount of programming beamed daily to China.
   VOA director Richard Carlson estimated recently that the service
has a listening audience of ``over 100 million'' in China.
   During the unrest, said Carlson, Chinese authorities have tried
to jam VOA Chinese radio broadcasts. They have not tried to jam
VOA's English language broadcasts.
   In response to the Chinese crisis, the VOA has also begun beaming
television signals into China, the first time it has ever taken such
a step.

   Reba Goins has never played basketball,
much less shot a free throw in front of television cameras and a
crowd of thousands, but she'll have $50,000 at stake when she steps
to the line at the Los Angeles Forum this week.
   The winner of a drawing sponsored by a snack-food maker, Mrs.
Goins, 57, will receive $10,000 for each of five free throw attempts
she makes during halftime at Game 4 of the Lakers-Pistons NBA
Championship playoff game Tuesday night.
   Even if Mrs. Goins misses all five free throws, she will still
take home $10,000.
   Hoping for the best, she is undergoing a crash course in
free-throw shooting under the watchful eye of her son-in-law at a
local elementary school gymnasium.
   Mrs. Goins said she shot about 50 free throws Thursday.
   How many did she make?
   ``Oh, two or three,'' she said.
   Still, she's been lucky so far, as evidenced by the fact that she
made the contest at all.
   ``I was just doing my shopping and saw an entry form and filled
it out,'' Mrs. Goins said. ``Then, last Saturday, I received a
letter by Federal Express telling me I had won. They (contest
sponsors) called Monday to see if I was going and I told them `yes'

   When Edward Green retired after 38 years of
looking after animals at the Audubon Zoo, his co-workers chipped in
for a farewell present _ a trip to Africa.
   ``It seemed to us that for someone who had worked with African
animals for 20 years, it would be really a neat thing if he could go
over there and see them in the wild,'' General Curator David
Anderson said. ``Especially for someone who had taught us as much as
he had.''
   During his trip this month, Green hopes to see elephants,
giraffes, rhinoceroses and gazelles _ many of whose cousins he
helped care for.
   Green, 63, had little schooling and no formal training in caring
for animals, except for growing up on a farm in his native
Woodville, Miss. What he knows about zebras and hippopotamuses, he
picked up on the job.
   His first zoo job _ for 36 cents an hour _ was cutting the grass.
After he became a zookeeper, he was assigned first to the monkeys,
then lions, birds and sea lions before spending 20 years working
with the hoofed animals.
   When he started, the animals were housed in small pens or cages;
now, most roam fields approximating natural habitats.
   On a recent tour, he described the hippopotamus: a mean creature,
who, despite her bulk and sluggish appearance, can leap suddenly out
of her pool. A keeper must be constantly alert, Green said.
   The giraffes were among his favorites. ``I never had no trouble
with them.''
   His least favorites? Grevy's zebras. And buffaloes. And
``Tommys,'' or Thomson's gazelles, small, deerlike creatures that he
called real mean.
   As a self-made expert, Green is skeptical of young zookeepers who
he says think a college degree is a substitute for actual
experience. And Anderson agrees.
   ``Ed taught me more about animals than anybody ever had,'' said
Anderson. ``We've had three assistant curators ... since then, and
he's helped teach every one of them something about animals _ and
about people, too.''
   Green was injured once _ an ostrich knocked him down _ because,
he said, he didn't have his mind on the job.
   ``But I knew what to do,'' Green said. ``I rolled over and over
to keep under him so he couldn't see me.''

   Fifteen protesters against the Seabrook
nuclear power plant, seeking a day in court, got themselves arrested
Saturday on a more serious charge than normal for such
demonstrations.
   ``We feel fine about that. We've been trying to do that for three
years,'' said Lee Wheeler, a spokesman for the anti-nuclear group,
Clamshell Alliance.
   Twelve adults and three juveniles were arrested shortly after
7:30 a.m. as they tried to block traffic at a gate to the stalled $6
billion plant, police said. The adults were released on bail or
personal recognizance and the juveniles were held until their
parents took them away.
   All 15 were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, an
offense that carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of a $1,000
fine and a year in jail.
   A three-day demonstration last weekend at Seabrook resulted in
734 arrests, although most of those arrested _ some more than once _
were charged only with a criminal trespass violation. A violation is
a summons, like a parking ticket, that carries a maximum $500 fine
and does not have to go to trial.
   Wheeler said the purpose of Saturday's blockade was to get
tougher charges filed so the group could get a court hearing.
   ``This was basically in response to some TV news shows Tuesday
and Wednesday where the police, etc., were saying that people
wouldn't do this if the charges were more serious,'' Wheeler said.
   Wheeler said the demonstrators hoped to be tried as a group and
with a jury.
   A hearing was scheduled for July 10 in Hampton District Court.
   The Seabrook reactor was completed nearly three years ago, but
federal regulators and objections by officials in neighboring
Massachusetts help up issuance of a license for low-power tests
until last month.
   Seabrook's operators had hoped to start the first chain reaction
last week, but won't be able to do so before at least the middle of
this week. Three faulty safety valves had to be taken out for
modification by the manufacturer. They have been returned to
Seabrook and were being re-installed Saturday, said Seabrook
spokesman Ron Sher.

   Vice President Dan Quayle and his family
took a whitewater rafting trip down North America's oldest river
Saturday after the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the water level
for a smoother ride.
   Quayle, his wife, Marilyn, and children Benjamin, Corinne and
Tucker put their raft into the New River about 10:30 a.m.,
accompanied by guides and three rafts filled with Secret Service
agents.
   The Army Corps of Engineers informed raft operators that it would
decrease flow from Bluestone Dam, 40 miles upriver, from 14,000
cubic feet per second Friday to 8,000-10,000 cfs Saturday, said
Susan Hanger, who runs Songer Whitewater in Fayetteville.
   ``He'll have a `kinder, gentler' ride,'' said Hanger, adding that
recent rains also would smooth the course over rapids from Cunard to
Fayette Station.
   The Quayles took a shorter trip than most rafters _ three hours
instead of four _ and exited the river about a mile downriver from
the usual landing. The vice president spoke with reporters before
the trip but not afterward.
   Quayle remarked on West Virginia's beauty, and mentioned a Bush
administration environmental proposal that could reduce demand for
the state's high-sulfur coal.
   ``We're going to be submitting clean air legislation and this
(rafting) will be in the spirit of clean air,'' he said. ``We'll get
out and taste a little bit, and have a little fresh air today and
enjoy the river and the scenery in West Virginia.''
   President Bush on Monday is expected to propose legislation
requiring a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by
the end of the century to combat acid rain.
   Quayle, reminded of the bill's possible impact in an area where
abandoned coal towns already line the New River, laughed, then
backed off of his remark.
   ``I know I shouldn't have mentioned that,'' he said.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton, a Democrat and a whitewater rafting
enthusiast, greted Quayle at Cunard but did not accompany him. State
Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict, the only Republican holding
statewide office in West Virginia, went along on the trip.
   The New River is at the bottom of a canyon rising to 1,000 feet.
The northward-flowing river _ its name notwithstanding _ predates
the glacial era, and geologists say that its age is comparable to
the Nile's.
   The vice president, who had been whitewater rafting once in
Wyoming, set aside Saturday for his family before embarking Sunday
on a three-day trip to Central America.
   The Quayles were clad in shorts and wore life preservers required
on rafting trips. After about 15 minutes of instruction, they put
their raft into the roily waters.
   An unexplained one-hour delay in the Quayles' departure caused
authorities to postpone other rafters' launches. A group that had
started its trip upriver at Thurmond was forced to tie up for 1{
hours along the river bank and wait until after the Quayles took off.
   ``Good morning, Mr. Vice President,'' some of the rafters shouted
when the Quayles passed them.
   Other rafters were displeased that the river wasn't at full
strength.
   ``I was expecting something a little more challenging,'' said
William Bradford of Newark, Del. ``But I understand. After all, he
is the vice president.''
   The U.S. Park Service made a 45-mile stretch of the New River
part of the national park system in 1978, shortly after the area was
opened up by the completion of four-lane U.S. 19 over the New River
Gorge at Fayette Station.

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Saturday announced
plans to abolish 18 state agencies, slash the number of Cabinet
posts, and surrender some power to the republics in the biggest
government overhaul of the Gorbachev era.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been streamlining and
decentralizing the Soviet bureaucracy because he blames it for
impeding his economic reforms.
   The Cabinet, or Council of Ministers _ which Ryzhkov heads _ has
been widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes.
   Speaking to a joint session of the nation's new two-chamber
legislature, the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov said of the 100 Cabinet
members appointed in 1984, only 10 will remain.
   He also told the session, broadcast live on state-run radio and
television, that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries,
construction, transport, agriculture and defense, only 32 would
remain.
   One of those eliminated will be the Ministry of Light Industry,
which oversees production of chronically scarce consumer goods.
   Ryzhkov, a 59-year-old technocrat re-elected premier on
Wednesday, said the remaining ministries in Moscow would abandon
day-to-day management of the country's industries and focus instead
on long-range planning as well as scientific and technological work.
   Gorbachev, who came to power in 1985, has said his goal is to rid
Soviet society of a half-century of top-heavy, bureaucratic
management ``by command'' epitomized by dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   In earlier phases of Gorbachev's program, ministry staffs were
cut by thousands, and several ministries were consolidated into a
superagency for agriculture.
   In March, however, the leadership decided to abolish the
superagency, which was blamed for mismanagement of food production
and distribution that has left some grocery shelves bare.
   Ryzhkov said some economic management functions will be
transferred to the 15 Soviet republics, many of which are
campaigning for greater control over their affairs.
   He mentioned specifically that the Ministry of Construction
Materials would be abolished and that republics would control
building supplies. Several lawmakers have complained that shortages
of construction materials cause long delays in projects.
   Despite the proposed reductions, two committees will be formed _
one to handle natural and manmade disasters and another to plan
economic reforms. Leonid Abalkin, a prominent economist, will handle
the economic panel.
   The government ministries were frequently criticized during 13
days of debate by the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies,
which ended its session Friday.
   At one point, Deputy Anatoly Miloserdny of Byelorussia blamed the
Cabinet for short-sightedness that he said led to ``the
disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.''
   Gorbachev urged deputies to grill ministers on why they are
dragging their feet on reforms. He acknowledged complaints that the
agencies ``are restructuring very slowly, if at all.''
   ``We have to find out what is wrong,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union suffers from a budget deficit projected to reach
$162 billion this year, inflation estimated last year at 8 percent
to 9 percent, and poverty that affects millions of people.
   Ryzhkov on Saturday announced nominees for the 10 Cabinet posts
that will remain. Supreme Soviet committees are scheduled to hold
confirmation hearings beginning June 19.
   Among those nominated to remain in their posts are KGB secret
police chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov.
   The full Supreme Soviet is to reconvene June 26 to vote on the
nominations and then draft legislation in a session that will last a
month and 10 days, Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov announced.
   In other work Saturday, the Supreme Soviet named heads of 14
committees to oversee such areas as state security, law enforcement
and farming in addition to economic reform.
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin was named head of a committee
on construction and architecture.

   The inaugural session of the new Soviet Congress
may in the end prove more frustrating than elevating for a nation
that has begun demanding results to match its leaders' talk.
   Frequently contrasted of late with China, where there was
economic reform without political reform, the Soviet Union has made
dramatic strides in opening its political system to popular
participation and unrestrained debate.
   But one point that debate harped on during the first session of
the Congress of People's Deputies was the failure of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, to produce tangible
improvements in people's lives.
   The Soviet Union is a superpower with missiles but little meat.
Its people have money but nothing to buy. Giant factories produce
pollution, but to no end, for no one wants their shoddy products.
   The result is a grinding sort of poverty and frustration bred by
chronic shortages and compounded by a new national awareness that
life isn't like that elsewhere and shouldn't be at home. What's
more, there is general agreement things are getting worse as
everyday goods disappear from stores, black marketeering flourishes
and inflation saps peoples' savings.
   Yet the Congress, after two weeks of mind-boggling televised
criticism that five years ago was hardly expressed around a kitchen
table for fear of being overheard, adjourned on Friday leaving no
particular course for the Kremlin to follow, no consensus for a new
program of action.
   Gorbachev called the meeting ``the most outstanding event in the
entire history of the Soviet state'' and said it heralded ``a new
stage of perestroika.'' Certainly in terms of free expression, that
was true.
   But human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, whose presence as a
deputy testified to the genuineness of the new democratic spirit,
said on the final day that the Congress had failed in its main task
as he defined it: ``to establish a system of power to overcome
economic and social problems and put an end to ecological madness.''
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, who had called on the
Congress to approve at least one program to cure a social ill, told
the Supreme Soviet legislature on Saturday he agreed with Sakharov's
criticism.
   ``We have not been offered a short-term program, economic and
financial, which would lead our country out of the dead end,''
Yeltsin said.
   There have been many cries recently, including at the Congress,
for the government to import popular consumer goods as a way of
demonstrating that those who heed Gorbachev's pleas to work harder
and better will have something to buy with the rewards they earn.
Without some incentive, there seems little reason for people to risk
breaking from the stagnant environment Gorbachev so often rails
against.
   But Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who heads the mammoth bureaucracy
charged with carrying out Gorbachev's reforms, told the Congress the
state cannot afford to finance what would only be a quick fix.
   He revealed the Soviet Union is carrying a $52 billion debt to
the West and is spending $20 billion a year to buy technology,
chemicals, raw materials and food from abroad. After servicing its
debt, he said, the nation already is running a $14.6 billion annual
deficit in convertible currencies.
   His alternative approach, announced to the new Supreme Soviet
legislature on Saturday, was to reorganize the bureaucracy for at
least the third time since Gorbachev took power four years ago.

   The top student at Jack Yates Senior High School,
who has a child and is seven months pregnant, delivered the
valedictory speech Saturday despite earlier doubts school officials
would allow her to do so.
   ``You and I are special,'' Carrie Mae Dixon said told 400
classmates during commencement ceremonies held at Texas Southern
University. ``We made many sacrifices and some of us even went
against all odds.''
   Miss Dixon, 18, became a center of controversy in April when an
article about her for the school paper was killed by Principal
Chester Smith. The article, titled ``Against all odds ... Student
becomes valedictorian despite motherhood,'' detailed Miss Dixon's
first pregnancy, and how she was shuffled among relatives after her
mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings.
   Smith said the school newpaper article was too personal. He cited
a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January 1988 that upheld the right of
school authorities to censor school newspapers.
   Miss Dixon said she doubted school officials would allow her to
give the valedictory address since she was pregnant a second time.
But officials later said there was no policy preventing her from
giving her speech.
   The petite student, wearing a bright red cap and gown, had to
pause and start her speech over as Smith lowered the microphone for
her.
   ``There were almost 1,000 of us that rushed through the halls of
Jack Yates Senior High School at the sound of the bell,'' in 1985,
she said.
   ``In less than four years, over 50 percent have disappeared.
Where did they go?'' she asked. ``You and I are special. Special
because we didn't give in to drugs, alcohol or peer pressure.''
   Miss Dixon, who shared the stage with other honor students,
including Mark Nealey, her boyfriend and father of her unborn child,
was first to receive her diploma. She also was recognized as an
honorable mention for the award of outstanding graduating girl.
   Miss Dixon attained valedictorian status by maintaing straight
A's in such honors classes as physics, calculus and economics. She
plans to attend the University of Houston to study chemical
engineering and has $17,500 in scholarships.
   Before and after the ceremonies, Miss Dixon eluded reporters and
photographers.
   The publicity about her graduation has helped Miss Dixon
financially, said Shuronda Robinson, editor of the school paper.
   ``People have sent money and offered things. I think it helped
her know that there are still people out there who care about other
people in this world. That everybody makes mistakes. She's gotten
letters from girls who are in her same situation.''
   ``And I think her story also lets others know that they can beat
the odds,'' she said.
   Student Tammi McCall, who wrote the censored story, said Miss
Dixon's scholastic achievements belie stereotypes that pregnant
teen-agers can't go far in life.
   Miss Dixon and her daughter, 20-month-old Terrisha KeAndrea, are
living with her boyfriend's family.
   Nealey, a National Merit Scholar, was vice president of the
graduating class.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out 5 of 37 Perjury Allegations In Ex-Congressman's
Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall's attorneys have
pared by five the 37 allegations of perjury for which he is on trial
and are preparing to call at least three congressmen to testify.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman ruled Friday that the five
of the 37 alleged statements that gave rise to perjury charges are
not relevant to the case.
   But he did not throw out any of the 10 perjury charges outright,
saying he would take defense motions for dismissal under advisement.
The 32 remaining disputed statements are divided among the 10
charges.
   While the jury took a day off in the 2-week-old trial, Freeman
also indicated that he personally believes at least some of
Swindall's allegedly perjurious statements were indeed false.
   Swindall was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in early
1988 about his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing as a
money launderer, and with a Swindall associate since convicted of
money laundering. Swindall was negotiating to obtain $850,000 from
the agent for construction of his home.
   The statements eliminated from the case involved questioning
about whether two exact terms were used during Swindall's money
discussions _ ``narcotic'' and ``hiding'' as it pertained to the
source of the money.
   Defense attorney Richard Hendrix has subpoenaed at least three
members of Congress to testify in the case, presumably in an effort
to refute the prosecution notion that Swindall should have been
familiar with money-laundering laws. The three are Rep. Howard
Coble, R-N.C., Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., and Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass.
   House officials have filed a motion to quash the subpoenas of
Coble and McMillan, which Freeman on Friday deferred ruling on until
it becomes obvious they are to be called. The Coble-McMillan motion
said that Frank is expected to respond separately.
   Hendrix did not say how many congressional representatives he has
subpoenaed, but he said some have indicated they will testify. The
jury returns Monday to begin hearing the defense portion of the case.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican, lost his seat in a bitterly
contested race to Democrat Ben Jones, a former actor on television's
``Dukes of Hazzard,'' last November, after the indictment was
returned.
   His attorneys contend he was duped by friend and associate
Charles LeChasney, who acted as middleman in the loan deal.
   Swindall testified before the grand jury that he ``walked away''
from the money deal after a Sept. 13, 1987, meeting with LeChasney
and the undercover agent.
   ``The evidence is clear he didn't walk away from it,'' Freeman
said in court Friday. ``The statement is literally false.''

   Two U.S. Air Force jet fighters
nearly collided with a Pan Am jumbo jet over West Germany, a
magazine reported on Saturday.
   The U.S. Air Force said it had received no reports of a near
collision.
   Der Spiegel magazine said the incident occurred near the city of
Koblenz on Tuesday. The magazine, citing unidentified aviation
control officials, said two U.S. Air Force F-111s changed course
without contacting air traffic controllers and headed on a collision
course with the Pan Am jet.
   The magazine did not say how close the jet fighters came to the
Pan Am plane.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Pan Am's airport offices in
Frankfurt said company officials were not available for comment.
   ``We have no record of near misses involving F-111s for the time
reported or the past week,'' said Maj. Bruce McFadden, a spokesman
for the U.S. Air Force's European Command in Ramstein.

   Japan's aid to Third World nations rose 22.5 percent
to $9.1 billion last year, second only to the United States'
estimated $9.8 billion in grants to developing countries, the
Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
   Development aid as a percentage of Japan's gross national product
was 0.32 percent, up from the previous year's 0.31 percent, the
ministry said in an annual report.
   Of the total, $6.4 billion went directly to developing nations,
the report said. That included $2.9 billion in grants and $3.5
billion in loans.
   Indirect assistance through the United Nations and other
international organizations was $2.7 billion, up 22.9 percent over
1987, the report said.
   The government earmarked $5.4 billion in the 1989 budget in
direct funding, ministry officials said. An additional $5 billion in
development assistance will be provided in loans and investments,
bringing total aid to more than $10 billion. That would make Japan
the world's largest aid donor, officials said.
   Japan has felt foreign pressure in recent years to do more for
developing nations.

<HEAD>Lt. Gov. Wilder Nominated For Virginia Governorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder, in his quest to become
the first black governor since Reconstruction, was tapped Saturday
as the Democratic nominee at the party convention.
   ``You had the courage to stand with me four years ago,'' Wilder
said, in reference to his 1985 underdog campaign that made him the
first black elected to statewide office in Virginia.
   Also nominated were businessman Donald S. Beyer Jr. for
lieutenant governor and Mary Sue Terry for a second term as attorney
general.
   Under state law, Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles cannot run for
a second consecutive term.
   ``The experts said it couldn't be done,'' said Wilder, a
58-year-old father of three whose daughter Lynn, an artist, gave one
of the seconding speeches for his nomination. ``But together, we did
it.''
   Ms. Wilder said her father taught her to be undaunted by risks.
   A Wilder victory on Nov. 7 would make him the first elected black
governor in U.S. history. At least one black served as governor, but
not as an elected governor, for a time in the South during the
period after the Civil War.
   His Republican opponent will be chosen Tuesday in a bitterly
contested primary from among former U.S. Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr.,
former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman and U.S. Rep. Stanford
E. Parris.
   Polls released last week showed the three GOP contenders
neck-and-neck and each slightly leading Wilder in a head-to-head
contest. But the Democratic ticket has swept all three offices in
the last two statewide elections, including Wilder's
precedent-setting victory as lieutenant governor four years ago.
   ``The people of Virginia do not want to turn back,'' Wilder said.
``They know Virginia is moving in the right direction. They want to
continue our progress and prosperity.''
   Wilder praised Baliles and his predecessor, former Gov. Charles
S. Robb, even though he has publicly feuded with both men on issues
ranging from tax policy to giving credit for election victories.
   At the convention, the three men clasped hands and raised them as
the 5,300 delegates and alternates cheered.
   Robb, now a U.S. senator, said in a seconding speech for Wilder
that their differences ``pale by comparison to what those
Republicans are saying about each other.'' He said he might not have
been elected lieutenant governor in 1977 and governor in 1981
without Wilder's help.
   Baliles, who was the target of a coal miners' protest at the
convention, said Wilder reminds him of the verse of poetry that
ends, ``Paddle your own canoe.''
   ``Well, I've looked out the window of the governor's office on
more than one occasion and, sure enough, there was Doug paddling by.
But he was always nice about it. He always waved,'' Baliles said.
   He said he admires Wilder because ``he knows what he believes in
and has the courage to stand and be counted.''
   About 150 labor delegates at the convention stood silently and
turned their backs to Baliles while the governor delivered the
keynote speech. The protest was over the sending of state troopers
to the southwest mountains, where some 1,700 members of the United
Mine Workers union have been on strike since April against the
Pittston Coal Group operations.
   ``We think he's turned his back on us by putting at least a third
of the state police out there escorting coal trucks and harassing
our people,'' said Sam Church, a convention delegate from Wise
County and former president of the UMW.
   Wilder, a grandson of slaves and a former state senator from
Richmond, came to the convention unopposed for the nomination. A bid
by state Sen. Daniel W. Bird Jr. of Wythe drew little support and
Bird dropped out of the contest earlier this year.

   The bishop of Shanghai, jailed for 30 years by
the Chinese Communists until his May 1988 release, called for
freedom and peace in his homeland during a memorial Mass on Saturday
for the students slain in Beijing.
   Bishop Ignatius Kung, who was released from a Chinese prison for
medical reasons, made his comments shortly after the secretary of
the interior laid a memorial wreath at the Statue of Liberty ``as an
eternal reminder of the cause'' for which the students died.
   In Washington, 500 to 600 people protested outside the Chinese
Embassy, and erected a 20-foot plaster replica of the Statue of
Liberty in a nearby park. The statue, however, was barely visible
from the embassy because it was largely shielded by tall bushes.
   About 200 Chinese students and supporters demonstrated in the
northern New Jersey city of Morristown under banners with such
messages as ``Give Me Freedom Or Give Me Death'' and ``Students In
Beijing, We Stand On Your Side.''
   The two ceremonies in New York marked the second consecutive day
of pro-student activities in the city in the wake of last weekend's
shootings in China. On Friday, more than 15,000 people packed Dag
Hammarskjold Plaza outide the United Nations after a memorial
service and mock funeral procession through Chinatown.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., saying the spirit of the
pro-democracy forces would never be forgotten, placed the memorial
wreath on Liberty Island at a brief Saturday morning ceremony.
   ``Sadly, we come here today to commemorate those who lost their
lives in the quest for freedom in their own lands,'' said Lujan.
``We were horrified by the brutal reminder that there are strong
forces in this world who seek to snuff out the flame of liberty.''
   Lujan, standing beneath the Statue of Liberty, thanked the
students for inspiring Americans by erecting the Goddess of
Democracy, a statue inspired by Miss Liberty that stood in Tiananmen
Square.
   Later, about 100 people filled the Transfiguration Church in
Chinatown to hear Kung deliver his comments.
   ``I am happy to be here, but at the same time very sad,'' Kung
said in his sermon, which was read by a translator. ``I am happy to
pray for human rights, but sad for the innocent youths who have been
brutally murdered.''
   The 88-year-old bishop was jailed in 1958 for his refusal to
renounce papal authority. Since his release last year, Kung has
since been receiving medical treatment in Stamford, Conn.
   ``The death of the Chinese young students is a great tragedy in
Chinese history. All of you who live in freedom, through your
prayers, must support our suffering brethren,'' said Kung.
   After saying Mass, the frail, bespectacled bishop blessed a
shrine inside the church set up to ``Beijing's Tiananmen Square
martyrs.'' A dozen wreaths sent by various groups in Chinatown
surrounded the shrine.
   After the Mass, dozens of parishioners lined up to pray at the
memorial. In the schoolyard adjoining the church, pro-student groups
set up tables to collect donations in the fight for democracy.
   There was one pocket of support for the Chinese government's
decision to use military force against the students. Sara Flounders,
a member of the national committee of the Workers World Party, said
the socialist organization backed the Chinese government.
   ``We feel it's in the interest of the working people and
oppressed people all over the world to support the Chinese
government,'' she said, labeling the student uprising ``a
counter-revolutionary development.''

   Two faces of the Rocky Flats nuclear plant were
presented by its operators and its federal overseers, an affidavit
and internal memos revealed after federal raids shut down the
facility as unsafe last week.
   Hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plutonium
reprocessing building while it was closed for safety violations, the
affidavit states, yet the Department of Energy paid Rocky Flats'
managers bonuses each year as rewards for production and management.
   A July 1986 Energy Department internal memorandum said Rocky
Flats was ``in poor condition generally in terms of environmental
compliance'' and its permit applications were ``grossly deficient.''
The memo also indicated some of the plant's waste facilities were
``patently illegal.'' Plutonium triggers are made at the plant,
northwest of Denver.
   Yet an ad for Rockwell International, the facility's operator,
appears in the current edition of a metropolitan weekly, the
Broomfield Enterprise, inviting the public to tour the plant.
Officials said the tours were the company's method of explaining to
neighboring communities how the nuclear weapons plant operated and
why.
   The Rocky Mountain News quoted an unidentified Rockwell spokesman
as saying that the ad was placed before the investigation.
   Another DOE memo, written July 14, 1986, said favorable news
media attention had been garnered for Rocky Flats officials who
negotiated a cleanup agreement with regulators, rather than the bad
press they might have deserved.
   ``Much of the good press we have gotten from the agreement ...
has taken attention away from just how really bad this site is,''
the memo said.
   Energy Department officials supported the statements of Rockwell
executives about plant safety and performance they allegedly knew
were false, according to the affidavit that was unsealed Friday in
U.S. District Court here.
   The affidavit was made public after it had been used earlier in
the week by federal agents to obtain warrants for the raids.
   Some of Rocky Flats' top managers since 1980 are among the DOE
and Rockwell officials named in the affidavit as possible
co-conspirators in violation of hazardous waste laws.
   They include Energy Department officials Earl Whiteman and
Raymond Romatowski, as well as Rockwell executives Dominic Sanchini
and J.E. Door. But representatives of the department and Rockwell
declined to comment on the affidavit.
   It says DOE and Rockwell officials are suspected of collaborating
on making low waste estimates at Rocky Flats. They also are accused
of making false statements regarding waste disposal at the facility.
   At that time, the plant's plutonium-reprocessing facility,
Building 771, was supposed to be shut down for four months afer
three safety inspectors were accidentally exposed to radiation.
   But the FBI, using infrared cameras during flights over Rocky
Flats in December, detected burning in an incinerator in Building
771.
   Meanwhile, Whiteman and Sanchini publicly were saying the
building totally was shut down.
   Whiteman and Dorr also were accused of misleading regulators in
1985 by certifying that Rocky Flats' groundwater monitoring system
complied with federal requirements. The affidavit says that
certification was found to be false and in violation of federal law.
   Whiteman and other Energy Department officials were accused of
claiming that a number of wastes were nonhazardous, when in fact
they were hazardous.
   A Nov. 13, 1987, Energy Department memo by Romatowski to other
department officials advised that the agency should resist the
efforts of environmental and public health authorities trying to
clean up Rocky Flats.
   The General Accounting Office also is conducting an investigation
into performance bonuses awarded Rocky Flats' managers.
   The DOE paid bonuses each year, ranging from $2.3 million in 1981
to $9.4 million last year, to reward Rockwell for its production and
management performance at Rocky Flats.
   In addition to the raid by FBI and EPA agents, the plant also
came under fire Wednesday from the Colorado Department of Health,
which announced it had found 25 environmental and procedural
violations at the plant.

<HEAD>Syrian-Christian Duel Kills 4, Amid Arab Mediation Effort</HEAD>

   Syrian and Christian gunners exchanged
rocket and artillery fire Saturday, killing four people and wounding
12.
   Arab officials, meanwhile, sought to halt the fighting and
reportedly were trying to gain support for a peace plan to end
Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   A police spokesman said the Syrians, entrenched in Moslem west
Beirut, blasted the Christian coastline north of Beirut with 130mm
howitzer shells and 107mm rockets.
   One round struck a residential district near the port of Jounieh,
12 miles north of Beirut, killing four people and wounding seven, he
said on condition of anonymity.
   Five other civilians were wounded in a retaliatory barrage on
west Beirut during which Christian units under Gen. Michel Aoun
opened up with 155mm howitzers, he said.
   The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people
killed and 1,432 wounded since the latest round of fighting began on
March 8 between Aoun's 20,000 forces and allied Syrian and Druse
Moslem fighters.
   The clash began when Aoun's forces blockaded illegal ports run by
Moslem militias that Aoun said cost the state treasury about $100
million yearly. Syria responded by blockading the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   Thuds of exploding shells shook the capital as Lakhdar Ibrahimi,
an Arab League envoy, shuttled twice between the Christian and
Moslem sectors for talks with Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet
in Lebanon's dual government, and Salim Hoss, his Moslem rival.
   The Arab League called a cease-fire on May 11 but the fighting
did not stop. The league renewed the call at a summit meeting in
Casablanca, Morocco, May 23-26 and appointed a three-member
committee to devise a peace plan.
   But Syrian forces kept shelling the Christian coastline, claiming
they wanted to prevent Iraqi supplies from reaching Aoun by sea.
These barrages have drawn occasional retaliation from Aoun's forces.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, left for Syria later Saturday.
   The Arab committee is comprised of Morocco's King Hassan II, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.
   Their foreign ministers arrived in Baghdad, Iraq, Saturday after
three days of talks in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad
and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who reportedly pledged to
assist their mission.
   Syria and Iraq, the Arab world's traditional rivals, are on
opposite sides of the Lebanese civil war.
   Syria, with 40,000 troops in northern and eastern provinces as
well as west Beirut, is the Moslems' main supporter. Iraq supports
Aoun, who has vowed to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon.
   The independent Beirut daily An-Nahar said the Arab foreign
ministers were soliciting support for a seven-point settlement
proposal.
   The plan, according to the paper, calls for ``exerting
international pressure on Israel to withdraw its forces from south
Lebanon.'' Israel has occupied a self-designated ``security sone''
in south Lebanon since 1985 in an effort to stop cross-border
guerrilla raids.
   According to An-Nahar, the peace proposal would include the
``deployment of an Algerian force'' along a 75-mile-long coastal
stretch from Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, to Tripoli, to prevent
the import and export of illegal goods.
   It also calls for lifting all sea, land and air blockades.

<TEXT>
   Millions of bicycles clog cratered
streets, electric trolleys lumber down tree-shaded avenues and dim
neon signs flicker above hole-in-the-wall bars.
   Shanghai grinds on after authorities made some arrests and issued
warnings of tougher action aimed at preventing China's largest city
from becoming the new focal point for the pro-democracy movement
crushed in Beijing last week.
   The fist of authority has come down, less forcefully in Shanghai
than elsewhere, but strong enough to stifle the reappearing
protests. Security forces have swept through Chinese cities in
recent days arresting scores of students and workers, including at
least 21 in Shanghai.
   In the last few days protesters wrought havoc on Shanghai's
traffic, blocking intersections with buses and concrete barricades.
   On Friday they held a rally in People's Square that drew 50,000
supporters _largest anywhere in China since the bloody suppression
of the democracy uprising June 3-4 that left at least 3,000 dead.
   Facing virtually no opposition from authorities in Shanghai,
which unlike Beijing is not under martial law, activists seemed
headed toward shifting the focus of the fight for freedom and
expanded rights to this city of 12 million.
   Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji gave what was viewed as a conciliatory
speech Thursday, urging civic obedience so troops would not be
called into the city.
   But authorities issued a clear warning against further unrest.
   ``We want to sternly warn certain ... students not to go any
further on this dangerous road,'' Shanghai radio said Saturday.
``There is a limit to the restraint of the people of Shanghai.''
   There was also a heavy police presence Saturday, with a motorcade
of 17 police motorcycles with sidecars and a small convoy of trucks
carrying workers urging rigid support of the Communist Party
swooping through the city.
   A major handicap for students' propaganda efforts is the lack of
news about what has happened in the capital 670 miles to the
northwest.
   ``The government says 23 students were killed, but how do we know
way down here in Shanghai?'' asked a 33-year-old delivery man.
   ``We know the students say many more were killed than the
government says, but we have no idea who's right,'' a mechanic said.
``We don't get any news.''
   Since before last week's bloody crackdown in Beijing, provincial
students had been returning to the countryside to inform the masses
about the revolution.
   But Shanghai students have not been particularly energetic in
spreading the word.
   There were scattered posters in Shanghai earlier this week
calling for a general strike, but they have largely disappeared,
residents say.
   Instead, Shanghai citizens seem to be absorbed in other kinds of
posters. In the city center, people stared intently at pictures of a
bodybuilding contest, movie promotions and shoe advertisements
tacked up along raucous Nanjing Road.
   Several clusters of people gathered at People's Square Saturday
to exchange opinions about the previous day's mass rally.
   ``I'm outraged, but I'm very afraid. I don't dare speak out,'' a
research scientist said. ``Our media is just communist party
propaganda. We all listen to the Voice of America and BBC broadcasts
every day to hear the truth.'' Several people around him nodded.
   Like all those interviewed in Shanghai, the scientist insisted
that his name not be used. The Chinese government began a new form
of terror Saturday, playing foreign news reports on television and
urging informers to identify Chinese who spoke on camera.
   About 200 students from Shahghai's Fudan and Tongji universities
held a rally and sit-in in front of Shanghai police headquarters to
demand the release of nine labor leaders arrested Friday.
   ``If they decided to press charges then they must do so in the
open, but they insist on doing it secretly,'' said a student leader
from Tongji University at the protest.
   The arrests appeared to be part of a nationwide campaign to
create a split between students and workers. By cracking down on
labor, authorities undermine a main source of support for the
student movement.
   At Fudan University, about 90 percent of the students have
returned to their homes out of fear of troops entering campus to
arrest students.
   Along the main path into campus there is an 8-foot plastic foam
model of the statue of liberty made by a neighboring school and
paraded around the city in marches before the May 20 imposition of
martial law in Beijing.
   Student leaders were divided earlier this week over whether to
continue disrupting city life.
   ``We finally agreed to an end to the barricades because the loss
in production caused by them becomes the people's burden,'' one
senior said.
   Diplomatic sources estimated production fell off in Shanghai, a
major industrial base, by as much as 50 percent after the barricades
caused widespread absenteeism at factories.
   With arrests stepping up in the last few days, it is time for the
democracy movement to pause and assess its lessons, students
interviewed at Fudan said.
   ``Most peasants don't understand our 1989 movement at all,'' one
freshman said. ``We must now concentrate on bringing the peasants
into play.
   Sheer fear and a need for quiet reflection are thus likely to
keep Shanghai from becoming the kind of rallying point for democracy
that Beijing was.
   ``The people of Shanghai are not cowards,'' said a young bank
teller at People's Square. ``But we are afraid of getting killed.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Child Killed, 29 Arabs Wounded in Clashes with Troops</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers opened fire Saturday on
Palestinians protesting new identity cards and an 8-year-old boy was
struck in the chest and fatally wounded, a doctor reported.
   Hospital officials said the boy was one of 30 Arabs wounded
during clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   According to residents of the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza
Strip, soldiers in jeeps used loudspeakers to announce that a
week-long military curfew on the strip would be lifted to allow
residents to obtain new computerized identity cards. The cards are
needed for Palestinians to work in Israel.
   Khader Muranakh, a camp resident, said about 200 Palestinians
began a protest march shouting slogans against the new cards.
   ``Youths started pelting the troops with stones and the soldiers
then opened fired,'' said United Nations nurse Muhammad Hamudeh.
   A doctor at the U.N. Relief and Works Administration clinic in
the camp said Shadi Ziad Rabah Awad, 8, was hit in the chest by a
rubbet-coated metal pellet and died despite an emergency operation.
   Muranakh said the boy was standing outside his uncle's home
watching the demonstration when troops opened fire from about two
yards away and wounded him.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death, but gave the boy's age as
12. The spokesman did not provide the circumstances of the death.
   Army officials have accused Palestinian activists of encouraging
children to participate in protests to act as shields for older
organizers and to serve propaganda purposes when they are wounded.
   Awad's death raised to 514 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began 18 months ago. Twenty-two Israelis also
have been slain in the violence.
   Arab reports said 28 Palestinians, including Awad, were wounded
in the Gaza Strip. They said two Palestinians were wounded in
clashes in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
   The army announced late Saturday that the curfew would remain in
effect on the Jabaliya refugee camp when it is lifted from the rest
of the Gaza Strip on Sunday.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a radio interview that the
army had succeeded in breaking a boycott ordered by the underground
leadership of the uprising.
   The leadership called on the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands to stop paying taxes, tear up identity cards, and not
cooperate with the military government.
   ``The opposite has happened,'' Rabin said. ``The individual today
needs and depends on the civil administration, and therefore there
is no more talk of a popular revolt.''
   ``On the other hand, we have not been able to prevail over the
sporadic stone throwings,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Officials Say Police Allowed Attacks on Minority Turks</HEAD>

   Local police have allowed roving bands of armed
youths to rampage through cities in Uzbekistan and attack minority
Turks and their homes, according to news reports Saturday.
   Officials said at least 80 people have been killed in the week of
violence in the Central Asian republic. The number of deaths was
expected to rise as security forces searched through the rubble of
hundreds of burned-out homes. One report said about 1,000 people
have been injured.
   Col. Gen. Y.V. Shatalin of the Interior Ministry told Soviet
television that a group of 5,000 ``extremist youth'' appeared in the
city of Kokand Friday afternoon and attacked government office
buildings and Meskhi Turk neighborhoods.
   ``For the first time, we saw a great number of automatic firearms
carried by the attackers,'' he said.
   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin said the inability of the
local police to protect the Turks was ``shameful,'' according to the
newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura.
   Uzbekistan Interior Minister D. Usatov accused police of looking
the other way, another news report said.
   ``The attacks of the extremists are more frequently taking on the
character of organized military action,'' said the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   Bakatin and other officials blamed the rioting on outside
agitators who they said went to the Fergana region of the Uzbekistan
in trucks and buses. The area is about 1,650 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   Soviet television's evening news program ``Vremya'' reported
Saturday that several thousand youths armed with knives, axes and
clubs drove around Kokand in stolen vehicles. It said they carried
out attacks that left 86 houses in flames, 11 people dead and 121
injured. A videotape showed burning houses and overturned cars.
   The Vremya correspondent said the figures were for a two-day
period but he did not say what the days were or if the death toll
was in addition to the 80 previously reported.
   Authorities said at least 9,000 security officers have been
dispatched to stop the violence. Sovietskaya Kultura quoted Shatalin
as saying soldiers had not fired on the mobs.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said at least one local
police officer was among the dead.
   The fighting began June 3 between ethnic Uzbeks and members of
the Meskhi Turk minority, who were forcibly resettled in 1944 in the
Fergana Valley by the late dictator Josef Stalin.
   Uzbek activists have blamed unemployment, working conditions in
the region's cotton fields and poor food supplies for increasing
local tensions.
   The Vremya correspondent said 10,000 people demonstrated in
downtown Kokand Friday demanding that cotton prices be increased, a
local chemical factory be closed and that the Meshki Turks be
resettled elsewhere.
   Meskhi Turks who came to Moscow seeking a meeting with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed poor economic conditions for the unrest,
but they also accused bands of attackers from other areas of
Uzbekistan for starting the arson and killing.
   The official press had initially characterized the rampage as
clashes between the two ethnic groups.
   More than 11,000 Meshki Turks are being guarded in emergency
refugee camps. Most of their homes have been burned down, and the
rioters were increasingly turning on police stations and government
officials, the reports said.
   In one case on June 4, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said
police saved the regional party leader, who had been captured and
doused with gasoline by a mob. It did not identify the official.
   ``One thing is absolutely clear,'' Bakatin was quoted as saying.
``Evil forces that want to destabilize the situation, interfere with
perestroika, are behind these events.''
   He said he had not determined who was responsible.
   Izvestia said people had been ordered to temporarily turn in
firearms, but only 87 had done so. More than 3,000 other guns have
been seized, it said.

<TEXT>
   The United States is sending a military attache to
interview a Japanese monk who reportedly saw American POWs in
Vietnamese prison camps recently, despite Hanoi's assertions that it
holds no prisoners.
   The Buddhist monk, Iwanobu Yoshida, 65, has been hospitalized in
northern Japan with what are termed mental and physical problems
since he was freed in January after 14 years' imprisonment in
Vietnam.
   In the past week, Japanese media reports and his daughter have
said that Yoshida shared a cell with Americans in the re-education
camp where he was held.
   The Vietnamese Embassy in Tokyo denied the claims, reiterating
that Hanoi holds no prisoners from the war, which ended in 1975.
   But the U.S. government has for years pressed Hanoi for an
accounting of the 1,730 Americans listed as missing in action in
Vietnam and 634 missing elsewhere in the war zone.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Saturday that a military attache
planned to fly to northern Sapporo Sunday to interview Yoshida and
the information will be relayed to Washington for analysis.
   The United States sought to interview Yoshida earlier but until
now had been turned down by his daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, on
grounds he was too ill, said the embassy spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
   Ms. Takatsuka on Saturday said her father had shared a cell with
three American prisoners for the last six years before returning to
Japan.
   ``My father told me that when he asked them if they were
Americans, they nodded,'' Ms. Takatsuka said in an interview from
her home in Sapporo on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island. The
prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, she said.
   A spokesman for the hospital where Yoshida is being treated said
he suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment, and only
his daughter can understand what he says.
   Hidenori Hareyama, a spokesman for Shiraishi Tokushukai Hospital
on Hokkaido said that Yoshida's speech is at times incoherent. Ms.
Takutsaka said her father had a stroke three years ago.
   Yoshida had been a city councilman in Mibari on Hokkaido before
he became a monk in 1966 and emigrated to Vietnam. He set up a
temple in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, and became a South
Vietnamese citizen in 1973.
   He was arrested in 1975, after the takeover of South Vietnam by
Communist forces. On Jan. 20, Vietnam released him on humanitarian
grounds after appeals from international human rights groups
including Amnesty International.
   Ms. Takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of the
three held in his cell, but said they were still ``young and
healthy.''
   Yoshida told her he saw more American POWs, perhaps more than 10,
before he suffered a stroke.
   ``My father is still afraid somebody will come and get him to
throw him back in the Vietnamese prison,'' she said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developing in moist air south of the southern
Plains region dumped large hail and heavy rain on central Texas
Saturday.
   Hail an inch in diameter pelted Bremond, and heavy rain fell in
Thornton and Marlin, all in central Texas. Homes were flooded and
several roads and a bridge washed out at Marlin.
   Strong thunderstorms created conditions favorable to tornadoes in
parts of southeastern New Mexico and West Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across Kansas, southern
Nebraska, western Missouri, northwestern Arkansas and northeast
Oklahoma. Dime-size hail struck the Oklahoma City area.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a slow-moving cold
front in the Southeast extended across northern Florida. A
thunderstorm in northeastern Florida spawned a tornado near Sopcoppy
and several waterspouts.
   Showers fell in the northern Atlantic Coast states. Scattered
thunderstorms moved into the northern Rockies and left 1.5 inches of
rain at Haugan, Mont., along with enough small hail to turn the
ground white.
   Sunny skies prevailed west of the Rockies, but most of the rest
of the country had cloudy weather.
   Heavier rainfall in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included an
inch at Cutbank, Mont., six-tenths of an inch at Bangor, Maine, and
more than a half-inch at Fort Worth, Texas, Emporia, Kan., and
Salina, Kan.
   Temperatures rose into the 90s across southern Texas and the
Florida peninsula, and in the Southwest's deserts. Clouds and rain
kept afternoon readings in the 60s in the lower Missouri Valley,
Great Lakes and parts of the Northeast, with 50s in Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 98 degrees at Beeville, Texas,
and Cotulla, Texas. The nation's low Saturday morning was 31 degrees
at Phillips, Wis.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the Gulf Coast states to the northern and central
Rockies, with showers and thunderstorms most numerous in eastern
Montana, central Iowa, and from north-central Texas through Arkansas
to Mississippi. Rain was predicted in northern New England and
upstate New York, with showers scattered across the northern
Atlantic Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast to fall below 80 degrees from the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley to New England and from North
Dakota to Washington, with 60s in western Montana and the lower
Great Lakes and northern New England. Highs should be in the 60s and
70s along the California coast, the 90s from Florida and southern
Georgia through southern and central Texas to interior California,
and above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   A train crashed into a bus in a village southwest
of Moscow and 31 people were killed in the second major railway
accident in the Soviet Union in less than a week, the official news
agency Tass reported Saturday.
   Tass said the accident occurred Friday afternoon after a railroad
worker flagged the bus driver to go ahead and cross the tracks. The
vehicle was struck by the train traveling 50 mph.
   Tass said at least 14 people were injured in the accident in
Kamenskaya-Pogorelovo, 640 miles southwest of Moscow.
   The train had left the Black Sea resort of Adler and was en route
to Voronezh, according to Tass.
   It reported the bus was carrying 46 passengers but it did not say
if the train was a freight or passenger train and if all of the
casualties were from the bus or if some were aboard the train.
   The agency said the accident happened at the same crossing where
106 people were killed in a collision of two trains on Aug. 7, 1987.
   Last Sunday gas from a pipeline exploded as two passenger trains
were passing on the Trans-Siberian Railroad 750 miles southeast of
Moscow in the Ural Mountains. At least 190 passengers were killed
and hundreds injured.
   Tass said 464 people were killed in accidents at Soviet railroad
crossings last year.

   A businessman convicted of overcharging the
government for work at an Army training base has been sentenced to
eight months in prison and a $14,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge Edward L. Filippine also sentenced Arthur
Kennedy to three years' probation Friday and ordered him to pay the
Defense Department $13,349 in restitution. Kennedy's company, Nimrod
Inc., was fined $6,400.
   Kennedy, president of Nimrod, and his company were convicted
March 17 of overcharging the government by about $13,000 in 1986 and
1987 on a contract to service residential furnaces at Fort Leonard
Wood, a major training base 125 miles southwest of St. Louis.
   A previous trial ended in a mistrial Feb. 6 when jurors said they
couldn't reach a verdict.
   A federal complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Springfield accused the 45-year-old St. Louis man of trying to
regain business at the fort through a third party. Nimrod was
suspended from receiving Army contracts.

<HEAD>Namibian Refugees Begin Returning; Angolans Join Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 people have crossed into
Namibia from Angola, the first sign of a massive repatriation under
terms of a U.N.-supervised independence process for this South
African-ruled territory, officials said Saturday.
   The refugees included both Namibians returning home and Angolans
fleeing the Angolan civil war, said Eberhard Hoffman, a spokesman
for Namibia's administrator general.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees has registered more than
than 41,000 Namibians at camps in Angola and Zambia who want to
return home, and a U.N.-supervised airlift is to begin Monday.
   Hoffman said the refugees crossed the border Friday on foot and
had no food or possessions other than the clothes they wore. They
were temporarily being housed in tents, he said.
   When Namibia's independence process began April 1 some guerrillas
belonging to SWAPO, the group fighting South African rule, entered
the territory from bases in southern Angola. Fighting with security
forces ensued until SWAPO ordered the guerrillas to return to Angola.
   Namibians fled their homeland to Angola and Zambia over the years
to escape the 23-year bush war between the security forces and the
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).
   Under a regional peace treaty signed in December, South Africa
agreed to end its 74-year rule of Namibia in return for Cuba
withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola where they
fought alongside government forces.
   Hoffman said he did not know how many Angolans fled into northern
Namibia in recent days, but he believed they will be granted refugee
status by the United Nations. Angolans fleeing to Namibia did not
receive refugee status previously.
   In recent months, there have been reports of sporadic fighting,
but no major battles, in the Angolan war. It was not clear whether
the Angolans leaving their homeland were fleeing a new outbreak of
fighting or if they simply decided to accompany the returning
Namibian refugees in hopes of receiving U.N. assistance.
   Angola has been at civil war since 1975, and most of the fighting
between the Marxist government troops and the U.S.-backed UNITA
rebels has been in the southern part of the country, near the
Namibian border.
   UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola)
was not part of the peace agreement and has continued to fight for a
power-sharing agreement with the Angolan government.
   Under Namibia's independence plan, elections are set for
November. SWAPO is widely favored to win, but they will need a
two-thirds' majority in order to control the new government. No
formal date has been set for independence, but it will likely be
early next year.

<HEAD>Authorities: Farmer Kills Self After Deputies Find 41 Cows Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARIBAULT, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farmer said to be in financial straits
killed himself after sheriff's deputies discovered the carcasses of
41 cows that had been dead in his barn since winter.
   Richard G. Turek, 42, shot himself in a field on his farm about
14 miles north of Faribault in southern Minnesota on Wednesday
morning, Dr. Asa Graham, the Rice County coroner, said Saturday.
   Sheriff Dave Schweisthal said Turek shot himself in the face with
a .22-caliber rifle after leaving a suicide note, which his family
declined to give authorities. Turek's body was found by a son.
   A deputy was first called to the farm Monday night, when a
neighbor complained about a strong odor coming from the property.
``He was told there was a dead hog and some dead turkeys and he told
them to clean them up because of the complaints,'' the sheriff said.
   When deputies showed up at the farm again late Tuesday with a
search warrant to enter the barn, Schweisthal said, ``He kind of
hung his head. Later, during the course of night, he seemed fine and
asked what would happen.''
   Authorities explained that he might face misdemeanor charges
related to the dead cows in the barn, but tried to reassure the
farmer that he wouldn't have to go to jail, the sheriff said.
   Turek told the deputies his cows had become sick over the winter
and died despite his efforts to treat them, but offered no
explanation about why he left their bodies in the barn, the sheriff
said.
   Four hours after the deputies left, Turek's family reported he
had shot himself.
   ``It doesn't make a lot of sense. He put a crop in this year. The
crops look good,'' Schweisthal said, adding that Turek and his
family have ``had a tough go of it financially.''
   ``He was trying to ... get back on his feet farming,''
Schweisthal said. ``There are still some unanswered questions that
we may never know the answers to.''

   Albert Spaggiari, mastermind of the
spectacular ``sewer gang'' bank heist and on the run for 12 years,
died and his body was left outside his mother's house by friends on
Saturday, police and the thief's lawyer reported.
   Police said Spaggiari's body was brought to his mother's home in
this Riviera city early Saturday by two men who fled. Police
specialists confirmed the body was that of Spaggiari, 57, who
underwent plastic surgery after France's most famous bank job in
1976.
   Jacques Peyrat, Spaggiari's lawyer, said his client died of lung
cancer on Friday.
   Spaggiari, who had a photography business in Nice, formed the
gang of ``sewer rats'' who tunneled their way into the Societe
Generale bank in Nice and over a weekend, July 17-19, 1976, opened
337 safe deposit boxes. They made off with gold, jewelry and
negotiable paper worth an estimated $6,835,812.
   The gang paddled a mile down a sewer and dug a tunnel 25 feet
long from the sewer to the back of the bank.
   Spaggiari was arrested shortly after the break-in but escaped
March 10, 1977.
   Two books, including Spaggiari's own account, were written on the
exploit and a film was made called ``The Sewers of Paradise.''

   Authorities filed murder indictments against
three people Saturday in connection with 15 slayings in Matamoros
blamed on a cult of devil-worshipping narcotics traffickers.
   Sara Aldrete Villarreal, a 24-year-old Matamoros college student
authorities call the cult's high priestess, Omar Francisco Orea
Ochoa, 23, and Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22, pleaded innocent.
   Aldrete was a companion of cult ``godfather'' Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo and Orea Ochoa was one of several of Constanzo's
homosexual lovers who belonged to the cult. De Leon Valdez served as
Constanzo's bodyguard and, authorities say, his executioner in a
death pact.
   The indictments also include weapons, drug and criminal
association charges, a spokesman for the 9th Federal Criminal Court
in Mexico City, Hector Miranda, said.
   The three suspects were indicted last month in two other
slayings, the May 6 shootings deaths of Constanzo and his right-hand
man, Martin Quintana Rodriguez. Constanzo and Quintana died when
police closed in on the Mexico City apartment where they had been
hiding out.
   Constanzo, Quintana, Aldrete, Orea Ochoa and de Leon Valdez went
into hiding in early April after police in the border town of
Matamoros discovered 15 horribly mutilated bodies buried on two
ranches.
   At least four were the victims of bizarre ritual sacrifices that
both authorities and suspects say were aimed at invoking magical
protection for drug-smuggling.
   A 21-year-old University of Texas pre-med student kidnapped while
on spring vacation, Mark Kilroy, was among the sacrificial victims.
   Seven people in Matamoros, including two fugitives, were charged
last month in the slayings.
   Aldrete and Orea Ochoa, of Mexico City, told The Associated Press
in a prison interview Friday that Constanzo forced them to go into
hiding with him. They both said they knew nothing about the slayings
until they saw news reports on television. Aldrete also rejected the
allegation she was the cult's high priestess or ``godmother.''

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said Saturday he
regretted the Amerian veto of a U.N. Security Council resolution
condemning Israel's crackdown in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``We regret that the United States had to resort to a veto while
calling themselves the champions of liberty and human rights,''
Arafat said at a news conference, held 48 hours after the third
official U.S.-PLO meeting in the Tunisian capital.
   ``I ask the president and the American administration: what are
Palestinian human rights under the occupation?'' he said.
   ``Why is there in the minds of the Americans two weights and two
measures when it is a question of rights of Palestinians under the
occupation and in other regions of the world,'' he added.
   The United States said the resolution was unbalanced because it
condemned Israel's crackdown in the territories while ignoring
violence by Palestinians. The vote Friday was 14-1, with only the
United States against. Britain, France and Canada voted for it.

<HEAD>Union Martyr Joe Hill's Ashes Scattered at Slain Miners' Monument</HEAD>

   The last ashes of union martyr Joe Hill
were scattered Saturday at a cemetery where five unionized miners
had lain in unmarked graves since being gunned down at a coal mine
nearly 62 years ago.
   ``It's high time you got back among your own people again,'' said
Carlos Cortes, a poet with the Industrial Workers of the World union
in Chicago, as he scattered Hill's ashes over the graves.
   Hill was an organizer for the IWW, one of the earliest unions
whose members were also called Wobblies.
   A granite marker with the names of the slain miners and of a
sixth miner who lies in a family plot in Louisville, Colo., was
unveiled in the green, neatly mowed cemetery about 20 miles
northwest of Denver.
   The dead, who were among 500 striking miners accompanied by wives
and children, were killed at the Columbine Mine on Nov. 21, 1927, by
state militiamen and mine guards using machine guns and rifles. The
strike was organized by the IWW.
   A marker commemorating the Columbine Massacre was unveiled
Saturday on Colorado Highway 7 about a mile south of the old
abandoned mine and four miles east of the cemetery.
   Hill was an immigrant from Sweden who became a Wobbly organizer
and songwriter.
   In 1915, he was executed by a Utah firing squad for the murder of
a grocer in Salt Lake City, where Hill had been organizing workers.
Supporters said the mining industry framed Hill, who maintained his
innocence to the end.
   At his last request, his body was cremated after a Chicago
funeral, and on May Day of 1916 his ashes were divided and scattered
in many states _ except Utah, where he said he wouldn't be caught
dead.
   The envelope containing the ashes scattered Saturday wound up at
the National Archives in Washington through a postal error, and
remained there another seven decades. Last fall, the archives
returned them to the IWW.
   Hill is best known to many modern Americans through the ballad
``Joe Hill,'' which folk singer Joan Baez sang at the Woodstock
Festival in 1969. One stanza runs: ``From San Diego up to Maine@ In
every mine and mill@ Where working men defend their rights@ It's
there you'll find Joe Hill...''
   During a general strike in 1927, the Columbine Mine was the only
one operating. Strikers and some family members went there Nov. 21
to try to persuade miners to join them.
   Rocks were hurled back and forth before a miner climbed up on a
closed gate and yelled, ``Come on!'' He was hauled down by police
and beaten.
   Pickets surged forward and burst through the gate, but were met
by withering gunfire from militiamen and guards, who had at least
two machine guns, according to historians and witnesses.
   Five of the dead _ John Eastenes, 34, of Lafayette; Nick
Spanudakhis, 34, of Lafayette; Frank Kovich of Erie; Jerry Davis,
21, of Frederick; Mike Vidovich, 35, of Erie _ were buried in a plot
at the Lafayette cemetery bought by the Wobblies.
   The Wobblies, however, didn't buy headstones and the miners'
families couldn't afford them.
   The sixth miner killed, Rene Jacques, 26, of Louisville was
buried in his hometown.
   Saturday's ceremonies were sponsored by the IWW, the United Mine
Workers of America, the Colorado Labor Forum and the Erie, Lafayette
and state historical societies.

<HEAD>Hong Kong and Macao Residents Fear Future with China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   China's bloody crackdown on students demanding
more democracy has sent shivers of fear through Hong Kong and Macao
_ British and Portuguese territories to be turned over to China by
the end of this century.
   Lydia Dunn, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council (cabinet),
said Saturday that Britain's decision to let only certain categories
of Hong Kong residents resettle in Britain would divide the colony.
   She said Britain has a moral obligation to give a ``home of last
resort'' to all of Hong Kong's 3.25 million people who are entitled
to British passports. A vast majority of Hong Kong's people are
Chinese.
   The colony is to be returned to China in July 1997 under an
agreement signed in 1984.
   In Lisbon, President Mario Soares said Portugal will stand by an
accord signed with China on Macao, a Portugese enclave in southern
China near Hong Kong.
   Under a 1986 agreement Portugal will cede Macao, which has a
population of about 500,000, to China by Dec. 20, 1999.
   In both the British and Portuguese accords China promises to
allow the two territories to maintain democratic structures and
mixed capitalist-socialist economies for at least 50 years after the
transfer of sovereignty.
   Soares expressed concern over the military supression of
pro-democracy groups in China in which hundreds of people were
killed, the Portugese news agency Lusa reported.
   It said in a statement to the people of Macao Soares said a
climate of liberty, democracy and tolerance is needed for economic
progress and social justice.
   Thousands of people in Hong Kong and Macao have joined
demonstrations protesting the violence in China.
   In talks last week between Hong Kong Governor David Wilson and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Mrs. Thatcher rejected
proposals to give the right of resettlement to all Hong Kong
residents.
   London newspapers reported Mrs. Thatcher's government was
prepared to admit up to 250,000 Hong Kong residents _ mainly current
and retired civil servants and leading businessmen.
   Hong Kong's lawmaking Legislative Council declared after a
meeting Friday that Britain has ``a fundamental moral duty'' to give
all residents entitled to British passports the right to resettle in
Britain.
   Mrs. Dunn said of the category system: ``We believe it would be a
disservice ... at this time when there is such unity to separate the
community into the haves and the have-nots.''
   She said Britain ``may decide to give out ... `X' number of
passports on some kind of categorization system but the rest will
continue to demand their rights.''
   London's Guardian newspaper reported Hong Kong is prepared to
offer asylum to political refugees from China.
   It quoted Geoffrey Barnes, Hong Kong's secretary for security, as
saying screening procedures have been established at at the border
with China's Guandong province ``even though it is recognized that
this move will add to the growing tensions between Hong Kong and
Beijing.''
   Barnes was in London for talks British officials.
   The Guardian said Barnes stressed that so far there have been no
requests for asylum among the handful of Chinese who cross illegally
into Hong Kong daily. The newspaper said that in the past such
illegal immigrants were sent back to China within 24 hours.
   Anti-China demonstrations were reported Saturday in Portugal and
in Rome.
   Portuguese newspapers said hundreds of university students held
protest rallies and student leaders at Coimbra university declared a
period of mourning until June 14 for the people killed in China's
martial-law crackdown.
   In Rome student representatives delivered to the Chinese Embassy
a petition they said was signed by 12,000 people condemning the
massacre of pro-democracy desmonstrators in Bejing.
   They said the petition also denounced the ``witchhunt'' under way
to seize the leaders of the Beijing demonstrations.

   Easy Goer, the beaten favorite in the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness, foiled Sunday Silence's bid for the Triple
Crown on Saturday with an eight-length victory in the Belmont Stakes.
   Ridden by Pat Day, the colt's winning time of 2:26 was the second
fastest Belmont in 121 races, after Secretariat's 2:24 when he won
the Triple Crown in 1973 with a 31-length victory.
   Instead of Sunday Silence, the 4-5 favorite, becoming the 12th
winner of the Triple Crown and the first since 1978, he became the
12th 3-year-old to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness only to lose
the 1{-mile Belmont.
   Sunday Silence, under Pat Valenzuela, was second behind
pace-setter Le Voyageur into the backstretch and Easy Goer was
third. Sunday Silence took the lead midway through the turn, but
Easy Goer snatched it away with a quarter-mile remaining.
   Sunday Silence finished a length ahead of Le Voyageur. Awe
Inspiring was 12 lengths back in fourth, followed by Hawkster, Rock
Point, Imbibe, Irish Actor, Triple Buck and Fire Maker.
   The winner paid $5.20, $2.80 and $2.40 to his backers in an
estimated crowd of more than 60,000. Sunday Silence returned $3 and
$2.60 and Le Voyageur was $4.60 to show.
   The Triple Crown drought is now at least 12 years, second longest
in the history of the series after the 25 years between Citation's
victory in 1948 and Secretariat's in 1973.

   A high-tech navigation satellite
designed to tell U.S. and allied military forces where they are
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe _ on land, sea or in the air _
rocketed into orbit Saturday.
   The three-stage Delta 2 rocket finally made it on the sixth
launch attempt. Bad weather wiped out four tries, and the fifth was
aborted at the last second when an engine valve failed to open. The
valve was replaced.
   The Delta 2 blasted off its launch pad right on schedule at 6:30
p.m. and left a fiery trail in a clear sky as it darted over the
Atlantic Ocean.
   The Air Force reported that the 12-story-tall rocket had
performed flawlessly in launching the Navstar satellite into an
initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles
above the Earth.
   ``We had normal spacecraft separation. Everything appears to have
gone extremely well with today's launch,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand,
the Air Force launch commentator.
   On Tuesday, an on-board motor is to fire to shift the satellite
into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up.
   The $30 million rocket carried a $65 million Navstar Global
Positioning System satellite, which could enable military units such
as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to determine their location
within 50 feet and in some cases to within 10 feet.
   Guided by the satellite, a submarine could unleash a nuclear
missile to strike within a few dozen feet of its target. A stealth
bomber could sneak up on its mark without turning on tell-tale radio
or radar.
   The satellite, effective in any kind of weather, also was
expected to keep track of military units' speed within a fraction of
a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth of a second.
   American and allied military users would receive information from
a coded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellite
system, would monitor an open channel providing them with a position
accuracy of 300 feet.
   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS contains an atomic clock with an
error rate of one second every 300,000 years.
   The satellite is the second of 21 upgraded Navstars that the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The first advanced Navstar was launched aboard the maiden flight
of the Delta 2 on Feb. 14.
   Seven earlier-model Navstar satellites are orbiting the Earth.
The new model has more power and improved systems and has added the
coded military channel.

   Residents of Philadelphia's historic Society
Hill neighborhood spent Saturday cleaning up debris from a tornado,
grateful no one was killed and only one person was injured in the
120 mph winds.
   The twister, which measured 50 yards across, touched down at 7:15
p.m. Friday and traveled a half mile before crossing the Delaware
River into Camden, N.J., according to the National Wealther Service.
   The same storm also spawned a tornado in northern Delaware that
ripped off roofs and tree tops and flattened the newly built
gymnasium at a private school. Delaware State Police said seven
houses were made uninhabitable around Hockessin.
   In western Pennsylvania, nearly 3 inches of rain fell in three
hours in parts of Butler and Venango County, carrying one home off
its foundation, damaging a bridge and washing out several roads.
   A 30-year-old man who was using a pay phone when the tornado
struck remained hospitalized Saturday with a concussion and facial
cuts. To the west of the city, a 13-year-old girl died after
apparently falling into a rain-swollen creek in Delaware County,
authorities said.
   The funnel cloud in Philadelphia's colonial section toppled
several trees, blew out windows and caused two walls of a four-story
parking garage to collapse, crushing two cars parked outside and
damaging a home.
   But the twister, the first in the city in four years, skipped
over houses and an adjacent outside mall of shops and restaurants.
   The garage walls fell into a small cobblestone street to the
north and into a vacant area and a couple's back yard to the west.
   ``It's amazing no one was hurt,'' said Charles Huntzinger,
general manager of Parkway, the company that runs the New Market
Parking Garage. ``If it had blown out the other way onto the front
street, who knows how many people would have been killed?''
   The falling rubble punctured the roof of Dorothy and Robert
Troyano's home, broke several windows and crushed their patio
furniture and grill.
   ``My husband heard this swoooooooosh and then a boom and the
whole house shook,'' said Mrs. Troyano, who was at work when the
twister hit. ``He's still in total shock.''
   But, she said, ``It could have been much worse. He could have
been hurt.''

   Author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. came to Ernest
Hemingway country and criticized the legendary writer for being out
of touch with America.
   ``He was in exile ... and he never explained the reason for his
exile, but he hardly knew us,'' Vonnegut said Friday at Boise State
University's ``Hemingway In Idaho'' conference.
   ``I wouldn't think Ketchum would be a place to learn a whole lot
about, you know, American black people, American Hispanics,''
Vonnegut said. Hemingway, who was born in Illinois but spent much of
his life abroad, had a home in Ketchum near the Sun Valley ski
resort in the last years of his life.
   Vonnegut did say that Hemingway, who committed suicide in Idaho
in 1961, was a top-rate artist with ``a soul the size of
Kilimanjaro.''
   Hemingway, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954, wrote
``The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' ``The Sun Also Rises'' and ``The Old
Man and the Sea.''
   Vonnegut said Hemingway may have seen his suicide as a
punctuation mark, a period, a way of ending the story of his own
life. But, Vonnegut said, life is not a story. A story is something
made up, something closer to a ballet.
   ``Only stories are supposed to be stories,'' said Vonnegut,
author of ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and ``Cat's Cradle.''

   Dick Gregory won a second round Saturday
in his battle to get shops to stop selling glass pipes and other
items that the activist says can be used for drugs.
   Joe Hutson, who had threatened Friday to sue Gregory and others
demonstrating at his store, the Fun Shop, said he gave in because
their protracted protests were bad for business.
   Gregory and several other people had been arrested five times in
the previous two days for refusing to leave Hutson's store, which
sells costume and party supplies as well as the items to which
Gregory objected.
   On Friday, Jim Willis, owner of another store targeted by
Gregory, Pipes Unique, agreed to remove the items and to allow
Gregory to post a sign stating, ``This store sells no merchandise to
be used for any illegal purpose.''
   Gregory was happy with Willis' action but said ``we're really
kind of surprised it took so long.''
   A court hearing on the arrests is scheduled June 22.

   Mark Morris, the bad boy of modern dance, returned
to the place that backed him long before he went to Belgium to cause
an international stir with iconoclastic ballets.
   Morris' new work, ``Dido and Aeneas,'' a ballet in which Morris
plays two female parts, received critical acclaim here last week.
   When ``Dido'' had its Brussels premier in March, one reviewer
asked how long that city would have to endure Morris'
``loathsomeness.'' Morris' dance company has two years left on a
three-year residence at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie.
   Morris, a 32-year-old Seattle, Wash., native who wears his tight
curly hair in long tendrils, says he views this disgruntlement by
the Belgians as xenophobia and discomfort with his acknowledged
homosexuality.
   ``Probably some people have a problem that I play female roles.
They forget about Greek theater and Japanese theater,'' Morris said
of ``Dido'' last week.
   At least Europeans are open to modern dance, which can't be said
of Americans, he said.
   In this country, ``there's not the same sort of governmental and
popular support. In the states, art ... is highfalutin, and that's
unfortunate, because it's not.''

   Gene Hackman won't be packing
a gun in his next film. And he couldn't be happier.
   ``It's a chance for me not to shoot anyone,'' said Hackman, who
is in town for ``Narrow Margin,'' which starts production in British
Columbia this week.
   The 58-year-old actor said Friday that he wants to move away from
shoot-'em-up movies such as the 1971 film ``The French Connection,''
for which he won an Oscar.
   ``I'd be hypocritical if I said I don't believe in violence or do
those kind of films, because I have in the past. I would like in my
later years now to not do so much of that kind of thing and maybe
films that have a little more social comment or more theatrics in
them.''
   Anne Archer, who received an Academy award nomination last year
for her performance in ``Fatal Attraction,'' is Hackman's co-star.

   Filming the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking story aboard
the cruise ship itself had its emotional moments, says Eva Marie
Saint, who plays the wife of the crippled American killed by
terrorists.
   The cast of the television film went aboard the Italian liner
during a regular cruise this spring. At one point, one of the
waiters who lived through the hijacking began crying, the actress
told reporters visiting the film's on-land set at Cinecitta studios
last week.
   ``Many of the waiters had been there during the hijacking ... and
while we were shooting, they lost control and relived the
experience,'' she said.
   Burt Lancaster plays Leon Klinghoffer, the wheelchair-bound New
Yorker who was dumped into the Mediterranean by Palestine
terrorists. Klinghoffer was the only passenger killed in the
hijacking, which ended with the terrorists' surrender to Italian
authorities.
   The film won't be ready for broadcast before 1990.

   Billionaire Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent
Cooke has conceded he is the father of a 16-month-old girl named
Jacqueline Kent Cooke and says he will provide financial support for
the child.
   Referring to the child as ``it,'' a lawyer for Cooke, 76,
acknowledged Cooke's parenthood at a hearing in Fauquier County,
Va., Circuit Court, confirming statements by his ex-wife, Suzanne
Martin Cooke.
   ``We concede that it is our child,'' attorney Milton S. Gould
said, according to a transcript of the April 5 hearing reported
Friday by The Washington Post. ``We have to support it, and we will
support it in such a manner as your honor determines that it is
entitled to.''
   Ms. Cooke, 33, has been fighting for child support from the
sports magnate since he filed for divorce in October 1987, less than
three months after their wedding. Ms. Cooke has alleged that Cooke
was angry that she violated a prenuptial agreement by becoming
pregnant shortly before their marriage.

<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, still
smarting from his Communist Party's stunning electoral defeat,
received promises Saturday of economic assistance from Britain.
   He was greeted at the start of his two-day visit by
pro-Solidarity demonsrators who demanded he resign.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, after a 3{-hour meeting with
Jaruzelski, promised economic aid to encourage progress ``on the
path of democracy and reform,'' according to a statement issued by
Mrs. Thatcher's office. It said the measures include a $7.75 million
annual contribution to a managerial fund to train Poles in ``a more
market-oriented economy.''
   British sources said the promised help fell short of Jaruzelski's
hopes for new direct credit lines.
   Supporters of Solidarity, the free union movement that won scores
of victories in Sunday's election, demonstrated outside the Polish
Embassy and draped a statue with banners in Solidarity's red and
white colors.
   Jaruzelski commented on the election in an interview with
Britain's Channel 4 television network.
   ``We went into the election as a very fragmented front, in
contrast to Solidarity,'' he said.
   ``Perhaps because we are burdened by a kind of complex of guilt
for so far not having sufficiently applied all sorts of democratic
procedures, we wanted to be super-democratic, super-pluralist,'' he
added.
   Jaruzelski, speaking Polish with his remarks translated into
English, also said ``the reforms are irreversible and we're going to
carry on with them.''
   The statement from Mrs. Thatcher's office said she told
Jaruzelski she welcomed the communist authorities' promise to stand
by the election results.
   Mrs. Thatcher also said Britain will play a role in getting
Poland's $38 billion foreign debt rescheduled by Western creditors,
according to the statement released after the meeting. But it said
Britain will encourage new loans only under an International
Monetary Fund economic reform program.
   Outside the Polish Embassy, Tadek Jarski, leader of the
British-based movement Solidarity with Solidarity, said Jaruzelski's
visit was a ``massive publicity stunt'' by Polish communist
authorities.
   ``They have lost and he has no right to come here as a
representative of the Polish people,'' said Jarski. ``If he claims
he wants to restore democracy then his first step must be to resign
and have really free elections.''
   Jarski compared Jaruzelski with the communist leaders responsible
for crushing the pro-democracy movement in China.
   ``We have not forgotten that it was Jaruzelski who sent troops to
crush democracy in Poland'' said Jarski, who referred to the killing
of striking ship workers in 1970 at the Gdansk shipyards and the
imposition of martial law in December 1981.
   Solidarity, established during strikes in August 1980, was
suspended under martial law and subsequently outlawed by Parliament.
It was legalized again under an April pact with the government that
opened the way for the elections.
   Jaruzelski's visit is aimed at widening contacts with Western
governments. French President Francois Mitterrand will visit Poland
next week and President Bush will visit Warsaw July 9-11.
   In Sunday's elections for the 100-member Senate Solidarity won 92
seats and eight were undecided and will be determined in runoff
balloting. Opposition and independent candidates were allowed to run
for only 161 seats in the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house, and they
won 160.
   Only two of 35 Communist Party and government candidates who ran
unopposed on a ``national list'' received more than 50 percent of
the vote, which was required for them to win the seats.

   Dozens of Americans fleeing Beijing arrived
Saturday with vivid stories of Chinese students carrying corpses in
the street, vehicles on fire and frenzied attempts by foreigners to
escape the military crackdown.
   ``We felt like refugees,'' said Lorene Sheppard of Seattle, who
was on vacation with her mother, Sylvane Drake.
   In Los Angeles, a Chinese graduate student feared arrested
following the bloody crackdown in the Chinese capital arrived
safely, his adviser said.
   ``Getting out of Beijing was a fiasco,'' said Dr. Neil Bryant of
the People to People Ambassador Program upon his arrival at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``At the airport, there was a lot of chaos, a tremendous amount
of confusion,'' the Seattle resident said. ``We were bumped off two
flights.''
   Continental flew three unscheduled charter flights from Beijing
to Tokyo on Saturday, transferring passengers to regular flights out
of Japan.
   Many apparently still felt a sense of urgency even after reaching
Tokyo.
   Passengers pushed through gates, said Capt. John Carl of Everett,
Wash., who piloted Continental Flight 38 from Tokyo to Seattle.
   Thirty-nine Americans who left Beijing were listed on Flight 38,
said Jim Collins, a Continental spokesman in Denver.
   Passenger Lisa Breitenbach was one of 40 Charlotte, N.C.,
residents who traveled to Baoding, China, their community's sister
city.
   The group arrived last Sunday in Beijing, and saw students
carrying corpses on stretchers and countless military vehicles on
fire, Breitenbach said.
   ``We saw people breaking wood to make clubs,'' Sheppard said.
``We were on the 15th floor of the Beijing Hotel, and saw four buses
on fire last Saturday and litters of people in the street.''
   ``It was the saddest thing I've ever seen,'' said Susan Durard,
who is from San Francisco and is with People to People, a non-profit
group of health professionals who bring their medical expertise to
other countries.
   ``We saw people with little babies in their arms, asking the
soldiers to leave them alone,'' Durard said. ``Our guide was a
Chinese doctor and he was crying and crying.''
   Durard said some People to People participants wore black ribbons
to show their support for the students.
   ``There is hatred of the Chinese government everywhere,'' she
said.
   Bryant said that when the group was returning from a trip to the
Great Wall, two lines of troops armed with rifles and bayonets
surrounded their bus.
   The group ``hit the deck,'' he said. ``I didn't know what was
going to happen.''
   Group members made it back to the hotel safely, but were confined
there.
   Breitenbach praised the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which has been
criticized by some returnees, for doing a ``fantastic'' job
evacuating Americans. Some members of her group have already
returned to the United States, and others waited to come home.
   Bryant said he taped passengers' cheers as his flight left
Beijing for Tokyo.
   ``When those wheels went up, it was great, but it was quite a
tremendous emotional process,'' he said. ``We left behind some
wonderful people. The government is just crushing them.''
   Among the Chinese feared caught in the violence and the arrests
that followed was Tong Boning, a University of California at Los
Angeles graduate student who took $8,000 in donations to
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   The 25-year-old man's last contact with friends in the United
States was last Sunday, when he held his telephone to the window of
his Beijing Hotel room to let a friend hear gunfire.
   Tong was last seen Monday trying to board a flight out of
Beijing. He didn't make it.
   On Saturday morning, he arrived in Los Angeles, said adviser S.Y.
Cheng, head of the UCLA graduate mathematics department.
   ``He is very tired. In a couple of days, we will have a press
conference and talk about it,'' Cheng said by telephone.

   Authorities on Saturday began a nationwide
political crackdown, announcing the arrests of more than 600
workers, students and other participants in the movement for
democracy.
   Leaders of the student campaign in Beijing and officials of
independent labor unions in the capital and Shanghai were in
custody, the state-run news said. Other protest leaders were ordered
to surrender themselves to police or face ``serious consquences.''
   Scores of people also were arrested in the provincial capitals of
Jinan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xian, Harbin, Shenyang, Changsha and
Nanjing. Disturbances broke out in all of these cities last week.
   The arrests came as authorities intensified a propaganda campaign
that blamed ``troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries'' for
confrontations last weekend in which the People's Liberation Army
killed hundreds of unarmed citizens in Beijing.
   The moves were further proof that hardliners, engaged in a power
struggle with moderates, have gained control of the government. The
re-emergence Friday of 84-year-old leader Deng Xiaoping with other
aging revolutionaries served to bring the point home.
   On Saturday, troop trucks with loudspeakers drove through central
Beijing. ``We love the people, we love the capital,'' they blared.
Soldiers in the back of the truck trained their AK-47s on passers-by.
   Troops near the bustling Wangfujing intersection detained one
youth who appeared to be a student. After searching his bags, a
soldier pulled him to a military tent pitched nearby. Two other
similar incidents were witnessed by Associated Press reporters.
   The evening television news reported the arrest of 26-year-old
Gua Haifeng, a history student from Beijing and a leader of the
United Association of Beijing Universities. The group led the seven
weeks of pro-democracy protests that preceded last weekend's
violence.
   Authorities said Gua, who had extensive contacts with Western
reporters, was arrested as he attempted to set fire to an armored
personnel carrier.
   They said he and the labor leaders were being investigated for
``counterrevolutionary crimes,'' which carry a sentence of 15 years
to death.
   The same news program broadcast footage from an American
television report in which a middle-aged Chinese man told of
soldiers gunning down scores of civilians in central Beijing.
   An announcer accused the man of ``rumor-mongering,'' a crime
under martial law regulations in force in Beijing, and urged the
audience to help in his arrest.
   Hotlines have been set up in every city district so citizens can
inform on ``counterrevolutionaries.'' Beijing Radio said city
officials had received 167 ``important'' reports by Friday.
   A student leader, in an audio recording broadcast on the CBS
Saturday Evening News, said that during the crackdown in Tienanmen
Square tanks rolled over students and killed them while they slept
in their tents.
   ``They thought, at most, that they would be carried away,'' said
the woman, Cai Ling, through an interpreter. She said she was chief
student commander in the square during the violence June 2-4.
   Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing, meanwhile, ordered security forces
to confront anyone found breaking the martial law regulations, in
effect since May 20.
   ``Wherever these hoodlums are engaging in illegal activities, the
police must battle them with the stern fist of the dictatorship of
the people,'' he said.
   He also said that Beijing industries lost about $108 million
during the first seven days of June. Chen blamed traffic problems
but wildcat strikes had been widespread.
   Chinese media said more than 400 ``scoundrels'' had been put in
jail for burning military vehicles and beating soldiers during the
army's invasion of the capital last weekend. On the television news,
police were shown interrogating one man at gunpoint.
   In Shanghai, about 200 students staged a sit-in to protest the
arrest of nine labor leaders. The city government issued a warning
saying there was ``a limit to the restraint of the people of
Shanghai.''
   More than 150 people had been arrested there, official reports
said.
   Foreigners and those Chinese who could continued their flight
from the country.
   The U.S. Embassy sent a convoy to nearby Tianjin to evacuate 89
foreign tourists, students, scholars and oil technicians. Most were
Americans.
   Huang Yasheng, an officer with the World Bank, was among the
Chinese who fled.
   ``The government has gone completely mad,'' he said before he
arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday. ``They are living centuries in the
past and refuse to recognize that the world is changing. I wanted to
help China but I see now that there is no hope.''
   Chinese media criticized the Voice of America and U.S. television
networks for their coverage of the violence in Beijing. And the
first foreign reporter was expelled from the country.
   The Xinhua News Agency criticized the VOA for reporting that
3,000 people had died and said the network's reports, widely popular
in China, were aimed at ``instigating hatred and resistance.''
   The Voice of America dismissed the criticism.
   ``The VOA checks its information prior to broadcast to be sure
the facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released in Washington
by VOA news director Philomena Jurey.
   Peter Newport, a correspondent from the British Independent
Television News, was thrown out of Shanghai for ``acting in a way
incompatible with his visa,'' according to ITN in London. News
Editor Mike Nolan said he did not know what type of visa Newport had.
   The campuses in Beijing were mostly empty Saturday. Students who
remained expressed shock at the violence of last weekend.
   ``I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one Beijing
University student. ``For more than 2,000 years Chinese have put up
with governments like these. It will take a long time to change.''

   A Chinese student leader on Saturday issued an
account of the crackdown against student protests in Beijing a week
ago, saying it was her responsibility to tell the truth being denied
in government reports.
   Cai Ling, who identified herself as the students' chief commander
from June 2 to June 4, said in an audio recording broadcast on the
CBS Evening News on Saturday that many students died and ``the
executioners were the soldiers of the 27th Army.''
   ``I think I'm the most qualified to talk about it, and it's my
responsibility to tell everyone the truth,'' Ms. Ling said through
an interpreter.
   She denied official Chinese government reports that only
soldiers, not students, were killed in Tiananmen Square a week ago.
Then she described the confrontation, saying many of the students
didn't expect violence.
   ``Some students still had hopes in the government and in the
soldiers. They thought, at most, that they would be carried away.
They were tired and returned to their tents to sleep.
   ``Then the tanks made pancakes out of them. ... I don't know the
total (number of dead), but the members of the Independent Workers
Union, on the outside, they stood their ground. And now they're all
dead.
   ``After students left the tanks and all their personnel carriers
flattened the tents with the bodies inside. Then they poured
gasoline over the remains and burned them,'' she said.
   Thousands of students, joined by workers and others, had
virtually paralyzed Chinese government operations in Tiananmen
Square for several weeks before soldiers took back the area on June
3. Estimates of the number of people killed range up to 3,000.
   CBS News said it had obtained the tape recording ``from a secret
location.''

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, displaying the
biting wit that enlivened her keynote speech at the Democratic
National Convention last summer, announced Saturday she will run for
governor.
   The Texas economy needs new leadership after a long downslide
fueled by oil and real estate busts, Ms. Richards told about 1,000
supporters at the state Capitol.
   ``You know, Sam Rayburn used to say that any jackass can kick
down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one,'' Ms. Richards
said, quoting the powerful former House Speaker from Texas.
   ``Today you and I become carpenters,'' she told the gathering,
which was treated to lemonade, balloons and performances by Mexican
mariachis, a church choir and the Waco High School band.
   Ms. Richards, who would be the state's second woman governor
elected in 66 years, said she wanted the job ``because I believe
that it is time and because of all the things I've stood for all of
my life.'' The last female governor, Miriam A. Ferguson, was elected
in 1924.
   Ms. Richards gained notoriety in her convention speech in Atlanta
in July when she attacked Republican policies saying, ``That dog
won't hunt.''
   The pithy state treasurer's declaration that then-Vice President
George Bush was born with a silver foot in his mouth prompted Bush
to send her a silver foot pin, which Ms. Richards' wore when the
president addressed the Legislature earlier this year.
   Ms. Richards may get to ply her wit against another George Bush,
the president's son, a Dallas businessman who is a probable
Republican candidate for governor. Other possible GOP contenders
include Secretary of State Jack Rains, Texas Railroad Commission
Chairman Kent Hance and oilman T. Boone Pickens.
   Asked about the possibility of facing the president's son as a
candidate in the 1990 election, Richards said, ``I have a primary to
take care of ... One day at a time. One election at a time.''
   The treasurer is expected to face Texas Attorney General Jim
Mattox in a bitter fight for the Democratic nomination.

<TEXT>
   The Observer newspaper, quoting unidentified
sources, reported Sunday that six Western hostages in Lebanon _ five
Americans and one Briton _ have been moved to Iran to ensure their
safety.
   The weekly identified none of the Americans but said the Briton
was television journalist John McCarthy.
   Quoting unidentified sources in Beirut, Damascus and Tehran, it
said McCarthy and two of the Americans were disguised as injured
Lebanese, transferred to the Syrian capital May 24 and flown to
Tehran.
   The newspaper said three of the seven other Americans abducted by
Iranian-backed Moslem extremists since 1985 were moved to Iran on
May 29.
   The Observer quoted the sources as saying Iran's interior
minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashami, decided to move the hostages after
intensified fighting between Moslems and Christians since March that
has left hundreds of people dead. The newspaper said Mohtashami
``has powerful leverage with Lebanese kidnap gangs.''
   McCarthy, 32, was snatched by gunmen as he headed to Beirut
Airport after five weeks on a Middle East assignment for
London-based Worldwide Television News. The abduction took place two
days after the U.S. bombing raid on Libya. No group claimed
responsibility.
   Altogether 15 Westerners, including nine Americans, are believed
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon. The
longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Firefighters used air
tankers and helicopters Saturday to help battle two blazes in steep
canyon terrain at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, a U.S. Forest
Service spokesman said.
   The larger of the lightning-sparked blazes consumed at least 600
acres of extremely dry desert shrubbery, while the second charred at
least 50 acres, fire information officer John Carpenter said.
   ``Carlsbad Caverns National Park has suspended all backcountry
use within the park,'' Carpenter said. ``But travel is not
restricted into the caverns.''
   About 180 firefighters from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
the National Park Service, the Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs were dispatched, in addition to three helicopters and
two air tankers, Carpenter said.
   Firefighters expected to contain both fires by Monday evening, he
said.
   The firefighters found the smaller fire Saturday morning, about
six miles away from the one that started Friday afternoon. It was
the eighth lightning-caused blaze in the park since Thursday evening.
   No injuries were reported, and the fires, about 25 miles
southwest of Carlsbad, did not threaten the cavern's entrances,
elevators or parking lots.

   The Bush administration believes Pakistan is
pressing ahead with a program to develop nuclear weapons despite its
prime minister's assurances to the contrary, The New York Times
reported in its Sunday editions.
   Unidentified administration officials quoted by the Times praised
Pakistan for slowing some aspects of its atomic program that worry
American analysts. However, they said there has been no slowdown in
other areas, such as Pakistan's longstanding worldwide efforts to
buy parts and nuclear weapons technology.
   Pakistan each year faces the cutoff of American military aid
unless the president certifies that the country does not possess a
nuclear device.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told President Bush and Congress
this week that Pakistan did not plan to make an atomic bomb.
   During her meeting with Bush, Central Intelligence Agency
Director William Webster took the unusual step of telling her in
detail what the United States knows about the Pakistani nuclear
program.
   The officials said Bush had decided it was important to show Ms.
Bhutto the extent of the United States' ability to monitor
activities in her country, the Times said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Wants To Up Limits On Earnings By Older Americans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Saturday he plans to
introduce legislation that would allow older Americans to earn more
money while holding on to more of their Social Security earnings.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said his bill
would increase both the amount of earnings a Social Security retiree
can have with no reduction in benefits, as well as reducing the rate
of reduction for those who earn over the limit.
   Under his proposal, a person who earned $15,000 in additional
income over their Social Security benefit would be allowed to retain
almost $800 more in Social Security benefits than under the present
law, said the Texas Democrat.
   Under the current Social Security earnings test, those 70 and
older are eligible for full benefits without regard to earnings.
   But those under 70 are considered retired and eligible for full
benefits only if their earnings are lower than a specified exemption
level.
   In 1990, the maximum a retiree aged 65 to 69 could earn without
suffering a reduction in Social Security benefits will be $9,360
under present law, said Bentsen. He would boost that to $10,620.
   Bentsen said that under his plan a person age 65 to 69, earning
$15,000 and receiving $8,000 in Social Security benefits, would lose
$1,095 in benefits next year, compared with $1,880 under existing
law.
   Retirees now typically lose all benefits when they have earnings
in excess of $34,000. Under the Bentsen plan, a person with $8,000
in Social Security benefits would have to earn almost $36,000 before
losing them all.
   Aides estimated that at least 600,000 Social Security
beneficiaries would benefit from the changes proposed by Bentsen.

   About 500 people gathered
Saturday at a memorial picnic for activist Abbie Hoffman, but
counter-demonstrators called the event a ``desecration'' of
historical Washington Crossing State Park.
   Among those at the picnic were Black Panther founder Bobby Seale
and poet Allen Ginsberg, who said he had tried to contact Hoffman
about a week before the activist committed suicide April 12 in his
apartment near New Hope.
   The poet, who said he knew Hoffman was depressed because his
mother was ill, recounted leaving a Tibetan saying on Hoffman's
answering machine: ``You will live or you will die. Both are good.''
   Ginsberg read political poems dealing with the Iran-Contra
scandal and environmental issues, then led the crowd in singing Joe
Cocker's song, ``You Are So Beautiful.''
   Seale said the people who called Hoffman un-American and a
dropout were wrong. ``He always said he never considered himself
outside the (political) system,'' Seale said.
   ``His heart, mind and soul could be found in the first two
paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence of the United
States,'' said Seale.
   Two groups staged counter-demonstrations at the park, saying a
memoral service there for Hoffman was a ``desecration'' of the
soldiers buried near the park, where George Washington crossed with
his troops to surprise British soldiers during the battle of Trenton
in 1776.
   Vietnam veteran John Corbett Jr., one of those protesting the
picnic, said Hoffman ``didn't care about anything but Abbie
Hoffman.''
   Hoffman started the Yippie movement to protest the Vietnam War,
then rose to prominence as one of the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals tried on charges of trying to disrupt the bloody Democratic
National Convention in Chicago in 1968.
   Hoffman's younger brother, Jack, and his mother, Florence,
traveled from Massachusetts for the gathering. ``He would have loved
this,'' the younger Hoffman said. ``He would have loved this spirit
of activism.''
   The activist also would have appreciated the protesters, his
brother said. ``He would have said that's what America's all about.''
   The gathering was sponsored by the environmental group,
Del-AWARE. Hoffman had moved to Pennsylvania to protest the building
of a nuclear power plant in Limerick Township, and to protest the
Point Pleasant pump near the Delaware River.

   George W. Beadle, a Nobel Prize-winning
biologist and former president of the University of Chicago, died
after a long illness. He was 85.
   Beadle died Friday at a nursing home in this Southern California
town. Relatives didn't supply the cause of death but said he had
been suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said university spokesman
Jonathan Kleinbard.
   ``George Beadle was an enormously distinguished scientist of
great personal qualities and quiet personal force. He presided over
a very important period of significant growth and enduring renewal
for the University of Chicago,'' said school President Hanna Gray.
   Beadle shared the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1948
with Edward Tatum and Joshua Lederberg for their discovery that
genes act by controlling enzymes that direct chemical reactions.
   His later studies clarified the origins of domestic corn, and he
was the author of a number of books on genetics.
   He was named president of the University of Chicago in 1961 and
retired in 1968.
   Beadle was born Oct. 22, 1903 on a farm near Wahoo, Neb. He
received his doctorate degree from Cornell University in 1931.
   He taught at Harvard and Stanford universtities and the
California Institute of Technology before coming to Chicago.
   Beadle is survived by his wife Muriel Barnett Beadle of Pomona;
his sister, Ruth; his sons, Redmond Barnett and David Beadle; and
five grandchildren.

Oath</HEAD>

   A Ku Klux Klan leader found guilty of
verbally abusing a police officer was ordered by a State Court judge
to memorize the Boy Scout oath and laws.
   Judge Robert McDuff last week ordered David Lee Craig to serve
six months on probation, pay a $130 fine and memorize the Scout
creed. Craig was found guilty of cursing Acworth Officer D. Barton
while Craig distributed KKK literature on a street last year.
   McDuff ordered Craig, the grand dragon of the True Knights of the
KKK, to memorize ``precepts ... to acquaint you with moral precepts
prevalent in our society.'' The oath and laws were taken from the
Boy Scout creed, he said.
   ``You are not being directed to approve or espouse them, merely
to memorize and know them,'' McDuff said in his order.
   The oath reads: ``On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to
God and my country and to obey the Scout law, to help other people
at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and
morally straight.''
   McDuff said he routinely orders memorization of the pledge of
allegiance to first-time offenders sentenced to probation with no
jail time.
   Craig was arrested Dec. 17 by Barton, who stopped to break up
traffic congestion problems caused by Klan members in Acworth.

   An 80-year-old man may have been too much
in love with his wife of nearly 60 years, friends and neighbors said
after police discovered the couple dead in a murder-suicide.
   Officials at the Beverly Terrace Nursing Home, where Ella
Streblow moved after suffering a stroke, called police when the
82-year-old woman didn't return from an outing with her husband,
Ewald, Thursday night.
   Later that night, officers found the couple's bodies in the
garage at their home in this city of about 18,000 people about
halfway between Milwaukee and Madison. Mrs. Streblow had been shot
once, and her husband hanged by a rope from the rafters.
   ``I look over there and I just can't believe it,'' said a
neighbor of 30 years, who asked not to be identified by name. ``They
were in love, really. They never did anything separately.''
   Members of Streblow's family visited him Sunday and noticed
nothing amiss, except that he remained depressed about his wife's
condition.
   Nursing home employees also noticed nothing out of the ordinary
when Streblow arrived Thursday to pick up his wife.
   ``It was just another visit,'' said Jean Brennan, who works in
Beverly Terrace's office.
   Mrs. Streblow moved into the nursing home last October when her
husband could no longer care for her at home.
   The Rev. Myron Kell, who knew the couple well, said the warning
signs were present, but no one realized how serious they were.
   ``This man was sinking deeper and deeper into depression because
of his wife's physical condition,'' said the Lutheran minister, the
couple's pastor for the last 20 years. ``He just seemed to be the
kind who withdrew inside of himself.''
   ``He couldn't say two words before he'd start crying,'' the
neighbor of 30 years said.
   Kell, who had visited Streblow weekly in the past month, said the
couple may have been too wrapped up in each other. He said friends,
family and he and his co-pastors tried unsuccessfully to nudge
Streblow out of his depression.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party and
opposition groups signed an agreement Saturday for negotiations on a
plan to provide for free elections next year and the transition to a
multiparty system.
   ``This offers the hope of a way out of the dead-end Hungarian
society and the hope that we may arrive at free elections which will
open the way to a new democratic Hungary,'' said Peter Toelgyessy, a
spokesman for the opposition organizations.
   The negotiations are to begin Tuesday in the Parliament building
and be televised.
   The agreement, signed by representatives of 17 groups including
the communists that are to take part in the negotiations, ended
months of talks.
   Communist Party Secretary Gyoergy Fejti called the agreement ``an
important milestone.''
   He told a news conference, ``We all agree that we want change.
The competition among us involves who has better ideas, given that
we all wish to avoid social destabilization.''
   Toelgyessy, speaking at the same news conference, said, ``The
talks are aimed solely at a peaceful transition to free elections
which will then reveal the strenth of the various parties.''
   Parliamentary elections are scheculed for mid-1990.
   The negotiations are to be three-sided. Nine opposition groups
have formed an alliance called the Opposition Round Table. The two
other participants will be the Communist Party and a group of
Communist-affiliated organizations.
   One section of the eight-page agreement states: ``The transition
from a one-party system to a representative democracy and the
creation of a constitutional state is realizable only through free
elections.''
   The document specifies that key legislation, such as a planned
law on political parties and drafts of a new constitution, must be
discussed in the negotiations before going to Parliament. Opposition
groups had insisted on that condition.
   The negotiations are to begin only three days before the reburial
ceremony of the remains of Imre Nagy, premier during the 1956 revolt
that was crushed by Soviet forces. Nagy was arrested, convicted of
crimes against the state and executed in 1958. His body was buried
in an unmarked grave.

<HEAD>Report: HUD Contractors Embezzled Foreclosure Proceeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contractors working for the Department of Housing
and Urban Development systematically embezzled millions of dollars
the government should have received from homes sold after
foreclosure, The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions.
   The newspaper said private escrow agents took the money with
little fear of recrimination from the Reagan administration.
   HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams has been ordered by HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp to conduct investigations in Denver, Houston,
New Orleans, Los Angeles and Washington, the newspaper said.
   ``There are several investigations and-or prosecutions around the
country in which the loss to HUD or the funds allegedly appropriated
to HUD exceed $1 million each,'' said assistant U.S. attorney Gary
P. Jordan of Baltimore, who is handling a Maryland case.
   In that case, an escrow agent, Marilyn Harrell, has been dubbed
``Robin HUD'' by federal investigators because she told agents that
she diverted as much as $5.5 million to charity, the newspaper said.
   The federal investigation, the Times reported, is separate from a
Congressional inquiry into allegations that influence-peddling at
the department allowed more than a dozen former Reagan
administration officials to benefit from housing programs meant for
the poor.
   The Washington Post on Saturday reported that the head of the
housing department's Washington office and three of her assistants
were placed on administrative leave last week pending a review of
charges that Harrell used HUD money to buy 20 homes and 40
automobiles for the poor.
   The Post said senior HUD officials estimated cost to the
government by alleged mismanagement at the Washington office at $10
million.
   ``This could never have gone on if they were doing their jobs
right,'' Harrell told the Times.
   In Texas, the inquiry has led to the indictment of Reba Louise
Lovell, 36, who is accused of embezzling $2.5 million from the sale
of 55 government-owned private homes in the Dallas area.
   The 79-count indictment against Ms. Lovell accused her of trying
to hide her activities by depositing sales proceeds in local banks
in amounts less than $10,000 so that they would not be reported to
the federal government.
   The homes in Texas were sold over a four-month period last year
and sold for between $15,000 to $80,000 each in the Dallas area
including Cedar Hill, Keller, and Fort Worth.
   HUD employs private escrow agents throughout the nation to handle
paperwork and to transfer the money from the sales of private homes
and other government properties to government accounts. The homes
being sold by the government have been obtained because the owners
default on their HUD-insured mortgages.
   After a home is resold, an escrow agent is supposed to transfer
the money to HUD, minus a small commission, often between $50 to
$200, the Times reported.
   In many instances, investigators told the newspaper, HUD
officials failed to notice that the money from the sales was not
transferred.
   One investigator told the Times: ``The laxity of oversight by HUD
was frightening. Nobody noticed, nobody cared, that the money wasn't
coming in. These private agents apparently felt after a while they
had carte blanche to keep it.''

<TEXT>
   The No. 3 leader of the Maoist Shining Path
movement was among 14 guerrillas killed by army units in a gun
battle in the southern highlands, the government reported Saturday.
   It said David Orosco, known as Comrade Merino, and the other
rebels were killed when they were trapped by an army unit in a
district in Apurimac state 320 miles southeast of Lima.
   The gunfight occurred Monday but information was delayed because
of the remoteness of the area and checks to identify Orosco as among
those slain, officials reported.
   Army intelligence sources said Orosco and a band of rebels used a
a base camp near the Pampas river in Apurimac to launch attacks
against targets in Apurimac and Ayacucho states. The government made
no mention of army casualties in the battle.
   Osman Morote, considered to be the Shining Path's No. 2 leader,
was captured about a year ago in Lima. He is awaiting trial on
charges of murder and terrorism.
   A tribunal of judges selected to try Morote, fearing attacks
against them by Shining Path assassins, have asked for insurance
policies worth $500,000 and special security measures.
   Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, is the Shining
Path's main leader.
   The guerrilla group emerged in 1980 and nearly 15,000 people have
been killed in its efforts to overthrow the government, according to
official statistics.

<TEXT>
   When President Bush visited China four months
ago, he declined to emphasize human rights issues. Now, faced with
repression there on a grand scale, he is making it a focus of his
China policy.
   Bush told an East Room news conference, ``We have to speak out in
favor of human rights. We aren't going to remake the world, but we
should stand for something.''
   He also defended the U.S. decision to harbor China's most famous
dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, saying ``It's awful hard when a man presents himself, a
person who is a dissident, and says his life is threatened, to turn
him back.''
   ``That isn't one of the premises on which the United States was
founded,'' Bush added at the Thursday night news conference.
   Fang is now enjoying the U.S. hospitality he was unable to claim
last February when he was invited to be a guest of the president at
dinner in Beijing.
   On the final night of a three-day visit to China, Bush hosted a
Texas-style barbecue for Chinese leaders in a Beijing hotel. But
Fang, who has spoken out repeatedly against human-rights abuses in
China, was barred from attending by Chinese police.
   Bush's protests did not come until the next day, amid some foot
shuffling by the administration over who actually invited the
dissident to the U.S.-hosted event _ the White House or the embassy
staff.
   The president's slowness of response in the incident and his
failure to stress the human rights issue _ either in public speeches
or in private meetings with Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
Prime Minister Li Peng _ drew criticism from some quarters.
   It also evoked comparisons with his predecessor, former President
Reagan, who often used public forums in communist countries to speak
out forcefully on human rights.
   Bush, in part, played down the issue during his visit so as not
to offend top Chinese officials. He has a personal relationship with
many of them. And he also has cited his familiarity with the Chinese
sensitivity to criticism from outside on internal matters.
   However, any constraints Bush may previously have felt about
denouncing human-rights abuses in clear terms were washed away with
the bloodshed of the past week in Tiananmen Square.
   His spokesman said Friday, ``Keep in mind that the government has
murdered many, many of its citizens. We have had an incredible
upheaval in (that) country.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added, ``Things are not going back to
normal soon or in a quick fashion. ... A situation has been put in
effect in China that is going to have an influence on that country
and on their relations with all countries of the world for a
considerable period of time.''
   As for the president, the personal relationships he established
with senior Chinese leaders over the years since he served there as
U.S. envoy in 1974-75 have been of little use to him in the current
crisis.
   As he told his news conference, he put in a call to Chinese
leaders but the line was busy.
   Fitzwater on Friday disclosed that the leader Bush had been
trying to reach was Deng Xiaoping himself. ``We were just informed
the call would not go through,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The call remains in place ... and of course, now it's public.
I'm sure Chinese officials have read about it and so forth,'' the
spokesman added.

<TEXT>
   Former Interior Secretary James Watt denies he
used his relationship with former Cabinet colleague Samuel Pierce to
sway the selection of federally subsidized housing projects for
developers who paid him as a consultant.
   Watt said Friday he ``never asked Secretary Pierce to do anything
that would embarrass him or me,'' during meetings with the
then-housing secretary in connection with a project to renovate a
low-income Maryland housing development.
   ``I left his office with no commitments from him other than that
he would check into it,'' said Watt, adding that his conduct was
``moral, ethical and effective.''
   The project was later financed under the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   The program came under congressional scrutiny in April when
current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended funding and criticized it
as being riddled with ``favoritism, mismanagement and
influence-peddling.''
   Kemp's action followed release of an inspector general's
investigative audit which revealed several former HUD and other
government officials had assisted public housing authorities and
developers in obtaining grants to renovate or repair subsidized
housing for low-income families.
   Kemp has restored 1989 funding for the program and issued new
guidelines on June 1.
   ``While in government, Mr. Watt often belittled federal programs
to assist the poor and the less fortunate. He spoke of the dangers
of being `lured by the crumbs of subsidies, entitlements and
giveaways,''' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., in opening Friday's
hearing of the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing
and employment.
   Yet Watt ``apparently decided to take advantage'' of them, Lantos
said. His subcommittee is one of several congressional panels
investigating the program.
   Watt described a ``fee sharing arrangement'' with Phoenix
Associates, a group headed by Joseph Strauss, a former special
assistant to Pierce. Watt and Phoenix were paid $300,000 as
consultants to developer Judith Siegel's Landex Corp. on a project
to renovate 312 units at the Kingsley Park Apartments in Essex, Md.
   ``This project came into existence because of influence-peddling
by you,'' Lantos charged. ``A much more worthy project may not have
come into existence because they didn't have the good fortune to
hire you.''
   ``The fact remains you were able to do something because of your
prior Cabinet relationship with Sam Pierce,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D- Mass., in a sometimes rancorous exchange with Watt.
   ``People had to pay to get influence on their behalf,'' Frank
said.
   ``I'm the messenger ... You don't need to bad-mouth the
messenger,'' Watt retorted.
   ``You're much more than a messenger,'' Frank replied. ``You are a
great critic of the established ways ... but when the chance to make
$169,000 came your way, that did not seem to motivate you.'' The
balance of $131,000 went to Phoenix Associates at Watt's request.
   Watt also testified he received $20,000 and $100,000 in
consultant fees from similar arrangements with the Phoenix group on
projects in New Jersey and Puerto Rico.
   Watt said he met on two occasions with Pierce in early 1985 in
connection with the projects and had several conversations with
three other HUD officials _ Deborah Gore Dean, a special assistant
to Pierce, Silvio DiBartolomeis and Maurice Barksdale, who both
served as assistant secretary for housing during Pierce's tenure.
   Watt resigned as former President Reagan's interior secretary in
October 1983. Pierce is the sole Cabinet secretary to remain with
Reagan through both his terms as president.
   However, Watt said he was not aware when he met with Dean that
Pierce had set up a three-person panel in the department, including
Dean, to select projects for mod rehab funding.
   Dean and DeBartolomeis are scheduled to testified before Lantos'
panel next week.

<HEAD>GAO: Not Enough Job Training Money Goes to Those in Need</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main job-training program is
providing more services to people who already have skills while
shortchanging those who need training the most, federal auditors
conclude in the latest report critical of the program.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
also said Friday in a report that too little attention is paid to
remedial education needs of high school dropouts in the system set
up under the Job Training Partnership Act.
   In addition, GAO questioned JTPA programs that pay for on-the-job
training for low-skill positions, saying in most cases it appears
the government is paying wage subsidies to employers who are
shirking their responsibilities to provide worthwhile training.
   ``JTPA has not targeted those with the greatest need for
employment and training services,'' the GAO said. ``The less
job-ready were receiving services that were less intensive than
those provided to the more job-ready.''
   Still, the agency said the Job Training Partnership Act was
proving far more effective than previous federal training programs.
   The GAO study, requested by the House Education and Labor
Committee, reviewed services provided by 63 of the 600 regional
``service delivery areas'' set up under the 1983 legislation
sponsored by Vice President Dan Quayle, then an Indiana senator, and
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. More than $10 billion has been spent
on the system in the past six years.
   The agency's findings were similar to those reached by an
advisory committee that monitors the act and by a Senate
subcommittee, led by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., which held extensive
hearings last year.
   Both Simon and the Bush administration have proposed amending the
program, and their proposals appear to answer most of the recent
criticisms, which focus largely on a failure of programs to target
those most in need of training and a failure to shape programs to
individual needs.
   Among the GAO's principal findings were:
   _Those most needing extensive skill training were least likely to
get it.
   _Some 37 percent of those eligible for Job Training Partnership
Act programs are high school dropouts but only 27 percent of the
participants are dropouts.
   _The system's programs currently serve roughly equal proportions
of clients who are ``job ready'' and who need extensive skills
training. ``This suggests that, nationwide, the program is not
targeting services,'' the study said.
   _About 43 percent of on-the-job training contracts were for lower
skills occupations such as custodians and dishwashers. ``In many
instances, on-the-job training contracts appeared to provide wage
subsides to employers,'' GAO said.
   ``While such training may be appropriate for certain individuals,
much of it appeared to be excessively long.''
   The GAO's recommendations matched many of those suggested by the
administration, Simon and the JTPA advisory committee, including
that spending formulas be rewritten to emphasize training for those
most in need of skills. GAO expanded on those suggestions by saying
more extensive training for promising occupations also should be a
major goal.
   The congressional agency acknowledged such an approach likely
would reduce the number of people served by the federal program,
which now provides services to just 6 percent of the eligible
population.
   ``Because more intensive training services are more costly, fewer
people are likely to be served under JTPA if such services are
offered to each participant,'' the GAO said.
   Included in the amendments being considered by Congress is a
requirement that the Job Training Partnership Act system coordinate
its programs with other federal, state and local education and
welfare programs.

   Some of the best-known editorial cartoonists
had lunch at the White House on Friday, but the guest list didn't
include Doonesbury's Garry Trudeau.
   Trudeau lampooned Bush frequently in last year's campaign. He
joked that Bush put his manhood in a blind trust and that he had a
secret twin brother, Skippy, who took care of the nasty side of
politics.
   Asked if the Doonesbury cartoonist was on the guest list for the
private lunch, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater replied,
``Garry, unfortunately, isn't going to make it this year.''
   Asked if Trudeau ever would be invited, Fitzwater quickly added,
``Not in my lifetime.''
   The cartoonists' lunch is an annual event that former President
Reagan started. Among the guests were Pat Oliphant, Tony Auth and
Jeff MacNelly.

   Thousands of Americans appear to have fled
China during the past week, spurred by the savage crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators and the advice of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that all U.S. citizens should depart.
   According to figures released Friday by State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, slightly more than 1,500 Americans
remained in the nation of 1 billion.
   U.S. officials had estimated that about 8,800 U.S. citizens were
in the country prior to last week's violence in which hundreds of
demonstrators were killed by Chinese troops.
   Ms. Tutwiler described Beijing as ``still an armed camp.''
   The White House on Friday denounced the Chinese government's call
for reprisals against the demonstrators and stressed that
authorities there had ``murdered many, many of its citizens.''
   President Bush, who placed a call to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
earlier in the week but was unable to get through, had not heard
back from Deng by Friday evening.
   ``The phone call remains placed and we'll see if he returns our
call,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   An administration source familiar with intelligence estimates
said the number of Chinese troops in and around the capital city had
grown to about 340,000 from 200,000 estimated earlier in the week.
   Deng appeared in public Friday for the first time since May 16 to
attend a ceremony at which he saluted military leaders for carrying
out the crackdown on the ``counter-revolutionaries'' who had
occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square until last weekend's military
assault.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Deng's reappearance did not settle the question
of who is in charge in China, nor does it clarify who bears
responsibility for ordering the crackdown.
   ``We think that it's a very clouded situation, and we aren't in a
situation to judge at this time to see who is in charge of what,''
she said. ``To be perfectly honest ... it seems to me that that
would be something the Chinese should be telling us, versus us
trying to sit back and guess.''
   Said Fitzwater: ``You can watch television and see who the
government is, but in terms of individual actions and motivations
... we don't know.''
   But he added that ``I don't think anyone doubts'' that Deng and
Prime Minister Li Peng are now in charge of the overall government
in Beijing.
   Fitzwater used some of the strongest language yet to express U.S.
condemnation of the military actions against unarmed civilians.
   ``Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its
citizens,'' said Fitzwater. ``Things are not going back to normal
soon or in a quick fashion.''
   He noted calls for reprisals were being announced over the
loudspeakers in the public squares in Beijing.
   ``Reprisals are repugnant. We certainly watch this situation with
grave concern,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush suspended military sales to China on Monday but has
refrained from economic sanctions, saying he does not want to cause
hardship for the Chinese people.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Friday there are approximately 500 Americans
left in Beijing, including 150 to 200 journalists and 116 U.S.
Embassy personnel. The remainder are business people and tourists,
she said.
   Between 50 and 100 Amercians are in Tianjin, near Beijing, and
the embassy has organized a bus caravan to return them to the
capital, the spokeswoman said.
   She said 10 dependents of U.S. government personnel are left in
China and will be leaving soon, and no American students remain at
Beijing University, one of the rallying points of the pro-democracy
movement.

   The Air Force planned a sixth attempt
to launch an advanced navigation satellite after a thunderstorm
scrubbed the latest try.
   Liftoff was scheduled for a nine-minute period about 6:30 p.m.
today.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, called off
Friday's effort 30 minutes before the planned liftoff because of a
forecast of lightning within 10 miles of the launch pad. A storm was
moving onto Cape Canaveral at the time.
   The first three launch attempts last month were halted by bad
weather. The fourth ended in a last-second abort when an engine fuel
valve failed to open. The valve has been replaced.
   The Delta 2 rocket is to boost into orbit a $65 million Navstar
satellite designed to enable U.S. and allied military units to fix
their locations anywhere in the world within 50 feet.

<TEXT>
   Rap star Williard Smith, known to fans as
Fresh Prince, heated up the city's district attorney race after his
lawyer, a contender in the race, groused about his client being
jailed overnight.
   Democratic challenger Walter Phillips, Smith's lawyer, had
criticized the prosecutor's office for allowing a person of Smith's
public stature to be arrested and jailed on the evidence of
``polluted'' witnesses.
   District Attorney Ron Castille responded Thursday by letter to
Phillips and said his opponent tried to influence the office when he
called trying to stop Smith's arrest.
   Smith _ part of the duo D.J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince _ was
charged with assault for allegedly ordering bodyguard Charles Mack
to ``get'' promoter William Hendricks, 38, during an argument at a
Philadelphia radio station Tuesday. Smith of suburban Philadelphia
was freed on bail Wednesday.
   Mack, 23, who police say punched Hendricks, is still at large.
   Smith and his partner, Jeffrey Townes, won a Grammy Award in
February for their hit, ``Parents Just Don't Understand.''
   ``We don't take into account a person's status in life and give
them any special treatment as he thinks this guy should have had,''
Castille said. ``That is not a fair and impartial application of the
law.''
   The district attorney further said he thought it was
inappropriate for Phillips to take cases during an election campaign.
   Phillips said he is not actively seeking clients while running
for office, but Smith's case was referred to him by a friend in New
York.

   A disc jockey's effort to drum up
money for the county's bare coffers has netted some unusual
donations, including trout worms and batch of silver dental
fillings, but not much cash.
   ``I started Tuesday taking up a radio appeal, so far having
raised $35.18,'' said Mark Brueckmann of radio station WSBS in Great
Barrington.
   Among the contributions: a Papermate pen refill, a cupcake
emblazoned with a lewd message, the worms and $3.35 worth of
fillings from the local dentist.
   He said his intention was to help the Berkshire County government
pay back a $1 million loan.
   The county commissioners appreciated the thought, even though
there's not much to show for it, Brueckmann said.
   ``I think it's kind of funny,'' said Commissioner John Pignatelli.
   The $1 million loan must be repaid at the end of June, with
$37,000 in interest, Brueckmann said.
   To pay the loan, the county will need some relief, perhaps
through an increase in excise taxes, Pignatelli said.

   Graduation processions barely lasted
through one refrain of ``Pomp and Circumstance'' at 19 Alaska high
schools for they had students in a class by themselves.
   Alaska, the nation's largest state, has more one-student
graduating classes this month than any other state, statistician
Harvey Cromett of the state Department of Education said Friday.
   His research showed the schools were mostly in native villages
across the sparsely populated state. The schools include Diomede
High School on Little Diomede Island near the coast of Siberia, and
Pelican High, an island school 1,220 miles to the southeast in the
Alaska Panhandle.
   ``We have a lot of really small villages out there who have just
a few students in them,'' Cromett said. ``I think we have about 100
village schools that probably have less than 30 students in them.''

   Comedian Dom DeLuise not only writes about
food, cooks it, grows it and bags it on TV commercials, but he's
co-starring with it on the stage.
   DeLuise plays Public Opinion in a fantasy version of the satiric
light opera ``Orpheus in the Underworld'' by Jacques Offenbach. In
the show, heaven's residents tire of eating and drinking ambrosia.
   ``Mercury goes to hell _ he says the food is gorgeous, they have
sausages and eggs, so there's a revolt,'' DeLuise said recently.
   The sausages and eggs go on to perform a musical number.
   ``There are no holds barred,'' said the portly comedian of the
production, based on the myth about a man who follows his beloved
wife to the underworld in an attempt to rescue her.
   DeLuise, featured in TV commercials for plastic food bags, has
written an autobiographical cookbook, ``Eat This ... It'll Make You
Feel Better.''
   ``Orpheus in the Underworld,'' directed by Peter Mark Schifter,
will run through July 2 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the

<HEAD>Israelis, Palestinians Face Divisions After 18 Months of Rebellion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Internal divisions among Palestinians and
Israelis have been magnified by 18 months of bloodshed in the
occupied lands and threaten to paralyze peace efforts.
   Leaders on both sides predict that, unless political progress is
made soon, the violence will grow and destroy a historic opportunity
for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``We are at a turning point, either to get a political solution
or resort to more violence,'' said Said Kanaan, a Palestinian
businessman who supports the Palestine Liberation Organization. ``We
are waiting to see if we can reap all that we have planted in the
past 18 months.''
   At least 512 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,000
wounded in the uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which began its 19th month Friday. Twenty-two Israelis have been
slain.
   Both societies have been polarized and advocates of violence are
becoming more active.
   Palestinian militants insist only a violent struggle can lead to
their own independent state.
   ``We are exposed to a lot of pressure to resort to violent
means,'' Kanaan told The Associated Press. ``This is growing mainly
among the lower cadres of the PLO and the population because the
Israelis are pushing us so much against the wall.''
   On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir speaks of
harsher measures to crush the uprising and Jewish settlers are
attacking Palestinian villages. A 13-year-old girl was killed in a
recent raid.
   Leftists, by contrast, grow more vocal in demands for talks with
the PLO and formation of a Palestinian state, both taboo in Israel.
   Amos Oz, a prominent leftist writer, said extremism, including
vigilante attacks by settlers, could destroy Israel.
   ``We don't want the nation to be ripped apart, but under no
circumstances will we acquiesce in the transformation of our country
into a monster,'' he told an audience of peace activists.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said in a telephone
interview: ``If both sides lose control completely, the situation
can deteriorate and we can have more violence.''
   Shamir faces increasing pressure in his conservative Likud bloc
to abandon plans for elections in the occupied lands that would
choose Palestinian delegates to negotiate with Israel.
   Shamir has said he will resign if Likud rejects the plan at its
convention next month.
   Mainstream PLO officials have conditionally accepted the
elections as a first step toward negotiating a permanent settlement,
but militants reject any compromise.
   ``I think only the continuation of the uprising will bring us
liberation,'' said Sufian Khatib, a Jerusalem physician whose views
have been linked to those of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a radical pro-Syrian faction of the PLO.
   ``The only obstacles are the compromises the PLO leadership is
making,'' he said. ``The PLO must focus its efforts only on the
uprising and its continuation.''
   Moderates say the uprising is a means of forcing Israel to
negotiate. Israel has refused contact with the PLO, which it defines
as a terrorist organization.
   ``Israel will find no alternative but to talk with the PLO,''
said Faisal Husseini, a moderate from Arab east Jerusalem. ``Israel
will be forced to approach us as a people with a leadership and
rights.''
   Yossi Ahimeir, a close aide to Shamir, said Israel would not bow
to violence and would crush the rebellion.
   ``The Arabs have two alternatives: to continue with the uprising
or enter the circle of peace,'' he said. ``They will achieve nothing
through the uprising.''
   Liel, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: ``If they reject
elections, I don't see in the future any plan that will pull us out
of the circle of violence.''

   The first meeting of the Congress of People's
Deputies quickly became an outlet for a national catharsis, with
representatives of the Soviet people pouring out anger and
grievances pent up for generations.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's tolerant hand, the
Congress has been purging Soviet society of its devils, re-examining
history from the rostrum and demanding answers no one dared demand
before in public.
   Just a year ago, at the Communist Party Conference, observers
were surprised by the candid criticism from little-known delegates
and frank arguments between senior party officials, some of which
were even shown on television.
   But from the opening moments of this Congress, which has been
broadcast live to a rapt nation except for two private sessions, the
horizons stretched again. This debate has been broader and more
pointed than anything seen in a public forum in this country in
living memory.
   ``Each one of us wants to talk out an ocean of emotion,'' said
Deputy Konstantin D. Lubenchenko.
   The result has been a tidal wave of words. Day after day for
nearly two weeks, the people's representatives _ most of them chosen
in competitive elections _ have talked openly, sometimes heatedly,
sometimes even shouting, and their voices are heard throughout the
land.
   Some of the criticism has been by deputies playing to their
constituents: complaints about the miserable roads in Siberia, the
disappearance of refrigerators, the poor health care.
   On occasion, the talk has even been personal.
   Gorbachev himself, who remains largely off limits to the
increasingly frank official press, was compared by one deputy to
Napoleon, ``who, fearing neither bullets nor death, led the nation
to victory but who, owing to sycophants and his wife, transformed
the republic into an empire.''
   ``You can put me to death, but I fear this path,'' said Leonid I.
Sukhov, a driver from Kharkov, who promised the president his vote
but warned: ``You, too, are incapable of avoiding the adulation and
influence of your wife.''
   ``Never before in history,'' he said, ``have the rich and the
poor sat at the same table, the former eating chicken, the latter
licking their own fingers. What kind of perestroika is this?''
   But deputies also have challenged the historical tenets on which
the union of the 15 Soviet socialist republics is based and have
demanded the Communist Party surrender its legal monopoly on power.
Until now, the sanctity of the union and one-party rule were not
open to question.
   ``Up to now, in our history books, we have said Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania voluntarily joined the Soviet Union and that it was a
popular revolution, there was no violence, and it was a declaration
of free will,'' said historian Roy Medvedev. ``This is a lie.''
   Lithuanian prosecutor Egidius V. Bichkauskas charged the three
independent Baltic states actually were handed to the Soviet Union
as the Soviets and the Germans secretly carved up the lands that lay
between them in 1939.
   ``As a result of this pact, sovereign Lithuania and the other
Baltic republics were occupied and incorporated into the Soviet
Union, losing their independent statehood,'' Bichkauskas noted.
   Soviets have been taught the three republics overthrew their
fascist rulers in popular uprisings in 1940, and were then occupied
by the Nazis and liberated by the Red Army at the end of the war.
Gorbachev said he could hardly believe the revisionists' account,
but he agreed to a congressional investigation to determine the
truth.
   Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze, a university professor, demanded the
Congress condemn the ``annexation of the independent democratic
Georgian republic'' by the Red Army in 1921, saying it violated a
1920 treaty agreed to by Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin. The
Congress did not act on his complaint, but Gamkrelidze gained a
national forum for a long-suppressed view.
   The inquisitive spirit of the Congress already has proved
contagious. After the first week of debate, an official newspaper
exposed the government's 27-year cover-up of how soldiers opened
fire on strikers in the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk,
secretly buried the bodies of 20 victims and repaved the street to
hide the blood.
   The account published by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper of
the Communist youth league, was accompanied by a commentary signed
by three Congress deputies, saying it was fitting to report details
of the long-secret affair during the Congress' first session.

<HEAD>Court Orders Agency to Reconsider Formaldehyde Standard</HEAD>

   A federal court has ordered the Labor
Department to conduct a new review of the cancer risks of exposure
to formaldehyde and also to reconsider its decision not to protect
the earnings of workers disabled by the gas.
   In a decision issued Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals here said
the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ``has
failed adequately to explain'' its determination that the exposure
limit for formaldehyde it set in 1987 made the cancer risk
insignificant.
   The court also said OSHA had offered a ``feeble'' explanation of
its decision not to include in its standard for formaldehyde
exposure provisions guaranteeing workers will be paid full wages and
retain seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illness
linked to the substance.
   The court, ruling in a suit filed by several unions, upheld
OSHA's decision not to require employers to provide annual medical
examinations to workers who are exposed to formaldehyde, a colorless
gas that when mixed with other materials has a number of
applications in industry and is found in numerous construction and
consumer products.
   Simple monitoring of employees who are exposed to the substance
and medical checkups if they develop skin or eye irritations and
other symptoms caused by formaldehyde exposure are enough to protect
workers, the court said.
   Also upheld was the OSHA-set exposure ``action level'' at which
employers are required to provide workers with training, protective
clothing and other measures for protection. The unions failed to
show that lowering that level would significantly enhance worker
safety, the court said.
   An OSHA spokesman said agency officials were reviewing the
decision and had no immediate comment.
   OSHA, revising a 1972 standard, in 1987 set a maximum permissible
exposure level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during an
eight-hour workday and set the action level at 0.5 ppm.
   A number of unions challenged the standard, saying OSHA should
have set a far more stringent exposure limit.
   The court, in returning to the Labor Department the question of
cancer risk, questioned the formula used by the department to
extrapolate the cancer risk to humans from the risk found in animal
studies.
   The court also dismissed OSHA's contention that it did not
include provisions protecting the earnings and seniority of workers
disabled by formaldehyde because it did not believe those workers
could ever return to their old jobs.
   The court said in other instances the agency had provided
earnings protection until a disabled worker was retrained for
another job, citing provisions applying to coal dust and lead
exposure.
   When it released the revised standard in 1987, OSHA said it would
help protect 2.2 million workers at an annual cost to industry of
more than $60 million. Employers who cannot reduce formaldehyde to
acceptable levels in the air have to provide respirators to workers.

<HEAD>Witnesses Differ on Effects of Bill Reducing Home Down Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home builders told Congress a bill lowering the
minimum down payment on government-backed home loans would ease the
nation's housing crisis, but a grass-roots group said it would
actually make homes less affordable.
   ``The greatest impediment to homeownership is excessive monthly
housing costs,'' not the down payment, Gale Cincotta of Chicago,
chairman of National People's Action, told the Senate Banking
Committee on Friday.
   In 12 years, she said, average costs for first-time buyers have
soared from less than one-quarter of their income to more than
one-third.
   Shirley McVay Wiseman of Lexington, Ky., president of the
National Association of Home Builders, cited a Harvard University
study that reached a different conclusion.
   ``Raising the cash necessary for a down payment is the greatest
obstacle to homeownership for first-time buyers,'' she quoted the
study as saying. That study concluded that 81 percent of potential
first-time buyers _ identified as renters between the ages of 25 and
34 _ don't have the money to make a 20 percent down payment on a
median-price starter home, which cost about $69,000 in 1986, she
said.
   The two housing experts were among several taking part in a
hearing on a bill sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
chairman of the committee, and 40 other senators. Cranston said he
expects the bill, aimed at making housing available to more
Americans, to be approved by the committee next month although it
likely will be sometime next year before it can clear Congress.
   The bill would:
   _Lower the 5 percent minimum down payment on FHA-insured
mortgages for most first home buyers to 3 percent. For all FHA
loans, the down payment would be cut to 3 percent of the first
$50,000 of value (up from $25,000) and 5 percent of the balance.
   _Permit FHA to insure loans for homes worth up to 95 percent of
local median sales prices, which would be as high as $180,000 in
high-cost areas of New England and California. The current limit is
$101,250.
   _Allow owners of Individual Retirement Account and 401(k)
retirement plans to withdraw money from those accounts to buy a home.
   David Perel, housing finance officer for Los Angeles, said the
IRA provision is highly desirable, although he predicted it would be
of little benefit to younger families looking for their first home.
   Cincotta, whose organization is a national coalition of
grass-roots community-action groups, said the IRA proposal would not
be equitable because it would represent a federal housing subsidy
only to those fortunate enough to have a retirement account. And in
case of a foreclosure, she said, such home buyers could face ``a
double whammy: losing their home and their life savings in one
stroke.''
   Willard Gourley of Charlotte, N.C., president of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, endorsed most parts of the Cranston bill.
``These enhancements to FHA can be the cornerstone of the federal
government's effort to expand homeownership opportunities,'' he said.

   President Bush praised Indonesia's management
of its foreign debt during a brief meeting with the president of the
Southeast Asian nation.
   During a half-hour talk with President Suharto late Friday, Bush
``praised Indonesia's debt management as an example of the
government's sound economic policies,'' the White House sai.
   World Bank headquarters in Washington said the Suharto
government's economic adjustment process ``has already benefited the
(Indonesian) economy, as shown by strong export performance, a
resurgence of investment and economic recovery.''
   The World Bank also announced a new $350 million World Bank loan
to help finance essential imports during the economic adjustment
process.
   The adjustments include encouraging the private sector through
improved incentives and deregulation, the Bank said. A major element
of Suharto's economic program has been to diversify Indonesian
exports away from petroleum so as to insulate the economy from
fluctuating oil prices.
   Suharto and Bush discussed the Cambodian conflict and conditions
generally in Southeast Asia, the White House said. The president
restated goals of self-determination and verified withdrawal of
Vietnamese forces from Cambodia and urged greater two-way
U.S.-Indonesian trade and investment.

<HEAD>Federal Prosecutor Faces Contempt, Job Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor whose sister was jailed
for not revealing the whereabouts of her daughter has defied a judge
by refusing to answer 26 questions about the child.
   The judge, who jailed Elizabeth Morgan in 1987, threatened
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert M. Morgan with contempt Friday and
said he could be jailed unless he agrees to answer.
   District of Columbia Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. excused Robert
Morgan from the courtroom with a warning to report any change of
address or employment.
   Morgan could face professional sanctions, including loss of his
job and disbarrment, for his defiance of the judge's order to answer
questions put to him by Eric A. Foretich, whom Ms. Morgan has
accused of sexually abusing their daughter Hilary.
   Dixon has kept the woman in jail since she sent the 6-year-old
girl into hiding rather than allow the father another court-ordered
visit.
   The custody battle between Ms. Morgan and Foretich, who adamantly
denies abusing the child and contends Ms. Morgan is insane, has been
going on almost since the girl's birth in 1983.
   The hearing Friday was ordered by the District of Columbia Court
of Appeals to determine if continued coercion would ever get Ms.
Morgan to reveal where the child is.
   Robert Morgan's first refusal came when he was asked the
whereabouts of his parents, who disappeared around the time the
child was last seen publicly.
   ``Your honor, I have appeared before most of the judges of the
court, and I have the greatest respect for its jurisdiction,'' he
said. ``But I respectfully decline to answer that question which
could lead to the discovery of my niece or further harm to her.''
   Warned by Dixon that he faced contempt charges, Morgan said, ``My
answer is the same.''
   Ms. Morgan also testified, repeating her contention that she
would remain in jail for the rest of her life rather than produce
the child.

<HEAD>Hopes are High for `Magic Bullet' Drug to Treat AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The experimental drug CD4 is the nearest thing to
a ``magic bullet'' that might one day be used to treat AIDS,
according to one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus.
   ``If CD4 doesn't work in the early phases, don't despair,'' Dr.
Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute said Friday at the
close of the Fifth International Conference on AIDS in Montreal.
   Gallo said CD4 blocks the mechanism where the AIDS virus attaches
to certain white blood cells and infects them. This mechanism is so
critical to AIDS virus growth in the body that some version of CD4
ought to be able to interfere with it, he said.
   He also reported that mice given a single AIDS virus gene
developed an AIDS-related cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma, suggesting
the cancer is caused by the virus itself.
   Gallo's studies on Kaposi's sarcoma offer one possible
explanation for the origin of the disease in AIDS patients.
   Others have evidence indicating Kaposi's sarcoma may be caused by
another virus, not the AIDS virus, but Gallo's work questions that
theory.
   His report dealt with a study involving Kaposi's sarcoma
developed in mice that were genetically engineered to contain an
AIDS virus gene called tat. The tat gene is a kind of supercharger
that speeds up the replication of the AIDS virus.
   Mice carrying the tat gene developed Kaposi's sarcoma, but the
cancer did not arise in the cells carrying the gene, according to
the study, but arose from other cells.
   Gallo said that finding suggests the gene triggers the production
of some biochemical factor that in turn causes the cancer.
   He also said certain Kaposi's sarcoma cells called spindle cells
are releasing ``a whole series of biological molecules that allow us
to create KS (Kaposi's sarcoma) in a mouse.''
   If the work proves correct, it offers the possibility that drugs
could be designed to interfere with these molecules and treat or
prevent Kaposi's sarcoma, Gallo said.
   The AIDS virus infects certain white blood cells called T4 cells,
or CD4 cells. These are master players in the immune system,
directing many immune functions.
   Gallo said other viruses that activate the immune system _ and
therefore T4 cells _ can aggravate infection with the AIDS virus,
known as the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   For example, a leukemia-causing virus called HTLV-1 can infect
the same cells infected with HIV and can ``turn on'' HIV in the
cells, resulting in the production of more HIV, he said.
   Human herpes virus type 6, or HHV-6, which was discovered
recently by Gallo and his colleagues, can also infect the same cells
and turn on HIV, he said.
   Gallo described what he said was a possible vicious cycle in
which HHV-6 and HIV work together to cause disease.
   ``All of us in this room almost have HHV-6,'' he said. Healthy
people control it and it causes no illness but HIV weakens the
immune system allowing HHV-6 to grow.
   The proliferating HHV-6 then triggers the production of HIV,
according to the study, and the HIV further weakens the immune
system, allowing further growth of HHV-6 in a continuing cycle.

   President Bush is ready to propose legislation
requiring a 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by
the end of the century to combat acid rain, sources say.
   The proposal is expected to be part of a far-reaching rewrite of
the 1970 Clean Air Act that Bush will unveil Monday. He was spending
the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., putting
finishing touches on the package.
   Bush's expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide _ emitted
mainly by coal-fired power plants and identified as a main
ingredient in forming acid rain _ is not quite as tough as the
12-million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists.
   But it was far stronger than utilities and other coal-burning
industries have advocated _ and represents a dramatic turnabout from
the Reagan adminstration's resistence to any new standards for
controlling acid rain.

   Pope John Paul II made concessions in
his tour of Scandinavia, but the Catholic pilgrim in the lands of
Luther failed to excite a public already indifferent to its own
church.
   From the fjords of Norway, to barren windswept Iceland to the
high-tech affluence of Sweden, John Paul's tour was unlike any of
his previous trips to Christian countries, even those like Britain
where Roman Catholics are a minority.
   Faced with some reluctance to the visit by Lutheran clergy, the
leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics agreed to sit in
silence in a Lutheran cathedral in Denmark, referred to himself
often as the ``bishop of Rome'' rather than as pope and listened to
chiding by Lutheran bishops.
   Even to his own flock, in a region with marked differences on
sexual morality with Rome's teaching, he used more cautious language
than usual when dealing with family issues.

   For years, U.S. Jews have set aside a special
matzo each Passover and prayed for the emigration of their brethren
in the Soviet Union.
   Now that those prayers have been answered for many, Jews in the
United States are being asked to set aside something more than
unleavened bread _ the money required to resettle as many as 50,000
Jews who are expected to leave the Soviet Union this year.
   The United Jewish Appeal, the national fund-raising campaign for
Jewish causes in the United States and Israel, has launched Passage
to Freedom, an effort aimed at raising $75 million for Soviet
emigres this year.
   Half will go to resettlement activities in the United States. The
rest will be split between Soviet Jews in transit to the United

percent chance of living for 18 months.
   In 1987, he had a 60 percent chance of living that long.
   In 1982, doctors had only a vague idea of how AIDS was spreading

have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study.

Cristiani took office.
   In addition to his talks with Cristiani, Quayle will meet with
non-fighting rebel leaders closely allied with the leftist
guerrillas, most likely Ruben Zamora and Guillermo Ungo, as well as
other opposition politicians and the country's military leaders, his

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Saturday announced
plans to abolish 18 state agencies, slash the number of Cabinet
posts, and surrender some power to the republics in the biggest
government overhaul of the Gorbachev era.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been streamlining and
decentralizing the Soviet bureaucracy because he blames it for
impeding his economic reforms.
   The Cabinet, or Council of Ministers _ which Ryzhkov heads _ has
been widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes.
   Speaking to a joint session of the nation's new two-chamber
legislature, the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov said of the 100 Cabinet
members appointed in 1984, only 10 will remain.
   He also told the session, broadcast live on state-run radio and
television, that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries,
construction, transport, agriculture and defense, only 32 would
remain.

   The top student at Jack Yates Senior High School,
who has a child and is seven months pregnant, delivered the
valedictory speech Saturday despite earlier doubts school officials
would allow her to do so.
   ``You and I are special,'' Carrie Mae Dixon told 400 classmates
during commencement ceremonies held at Texas Southern University.
``We made many sacrifices and some of us even went against all
odds.''
   Miss Dixon, 18, became a center of controversy in April when an
article about her for the school paper was killed by Principal
Chester Smith. The article, titled ``Against all odds ... Student
becomes valedictorian despite motherhood,'' detailed Miss Dixon's
first pregnancy, and how she was shuffled among relatives after her
mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings.
   Smith said the school newpaper article was too personal. He cited
a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January 1988 that upheld the right of
school authorities to censor school newspapers.
