<HEAD>Black Bishops Urge Stallings to Turn Back</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 13 black Roman Catholic bishops of the
United States on Wednesday urged a black priest suspended for
establishing an unsanctioned African-American Catholic congregation
to abandon his efforts and return to the church.
   ``We sincerely hope that they are not commingling personal
disappointment, individually felt frustrations and personal anger
under the banner of racism,'' the bishops said in a statement.
Racism ``is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish
concerns.''
   Earlier this month, the Rev. George A. Stallings, 41, established
the independent Imani Temple, saying the Catholic Church had failed
to embrace the culture, history and spirit of its black parishoners.
   Stallings also said that he and Cardinal James A. Hickey failed
to agree on Stallings' future assignment in the Archdiocese of
Washington.
   In the statement, the bishops admitted that racism exists in the
church but said the problem must be solved by dialogue between the
black community and the church leaders.
   ``If they claim such action is the result of their personal and
perhaps even shared frustration that racism has not yet been removed
from the church,'' the bishops wrote, ``then we urge a prudent and
patient rededication to the principles of honest cooperation and
dialogue.''
   Stallings was quoted in Thursday editions of The Washington Post
as saying the bishops had ``opted for office and position over their
ability to exercise a prophetic voice.''
   Stallings has been forbidden to preach, celebrate Mass or
administer any sacraments, church officials said.
   Earlier this week, Stallings said he would present a
reconciliation plan to the Archiocese of Washington but ``must take
place on our terms and must affirm our right to religious,
spiritual, liturgical and theological self-determination.''
   The Rev. William Lori, Hickey's spokesman, has said repeatedly
that the church hopes for a reconcilation. The cardinal, in an
article for Thursday's Washington Post, wrote, ``I believe this
particular situation has more to do with the problems and
expectations of one individual than broader questions about the
adequacy of the chuch's ministry in the black community. ... To
Father Stallings, I say come home.''
   The bishops' statement was released through the United States
Catholic Conference by Baltimore auxiliary bishop John Ricard.
   The other 12 who signed the statement were Archbishop Eugene
Marino of Atlanta, Bishop Joseph Howze of Biloxi, Miss., and
auxiliary bishops Harold Perry of New Orleans, Joseph Francis of
Newark, N.J.; James Lyke of Cleveland, Emerson Moore of New York,
Moses Anderson of Detroit, Wilton Gregory of Chicago, J. Terry Steib
of St. Louis, Carl Fisher of Los Angeles, Curtis Guillory of
Galveston-Houston and Leonard Olivier of Washington.

   A former school administrator who killed his wife
and hid her body in a basement freezer for 3{ years was sentenced
Wednesday to 20 to 40 years in prison.
   Leonard Tyburski, 46, was ordered transferred to the state
Corrections Department from the Wayne County Jail, where he has
remained since his June 26 second-degree murder conviction.
   Dorothy Tyburski, 37, was beaten to death in the basement of the
couple's home in Wayne County's Canton Township in 1985. Her body
was found Jan. 2 when their oldest daughter, Kelly, pried open the
locked freezer.
   Their youngest daughter, Kim, 16, had pleaded in a letter to
Wayne County Circuit Judge Richard P. Hathaway for leniency for her
father.
   ``We're disappointed by the sentence,'' Carole Stanyar said.
Tyburski will be ``well into his 60s'' before he is paroled, she
added.
   Kelly Tyburski said she felt sorry for her sister, but believed
her father should spend some time behind bars. ``It was wrong,'' she
said. ``Even if my mother was the cause of it, he should have
controlled himself.''
   Tyburski testified that he repeatedly smashed his wife's head
into a basement pillar after she taunted him about an affair she was
having with Kelly's 18-year-old boyfriend, who lived at the Tyburski
house.
   Stanyar said her client hasn't decided whether he would appeal
the conviction or his prison term.

<UNK>Burma Reimposes Ban On Press Visits</UNK>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military government has
reimposed a ban on the issuing of visas to foreign journalists just
months after relaxing restrictions in force for more than a quarter
century.
   A telexed message received by a Bangkok-based journalist from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon said visas were temporarily
suspended for journalists because of adverse news reports on Burma
by visiting correspondents.
   The text, dated July 4, was made available to The Associated
Press on Tuesday.
   ``Due to the fact that some correspondents have given adverse
reports on the situation in Myanmar (Burma) we've temporarily
suspended issuance of visas to foreign correspondents for the time
being,'' said a telex from Ohn Kyaw, director general of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon.
   Other Bangkok-based journalists said they had received similar
responses to applications for visas from Burma's embassy in Bangkok.
   Burma rarely issued visas to foreign journalists after xenophobic
socialist strongman Ne Win took power in 1962.
   Last year, many foreign correspondents travelled to Burma
unofficially on tourist visas to cover a national uprising for
democracy.
   Burma suspended the issuing of tourist visas shortly before the
army began to crack down on the mass demonstrations, killing
thousands of people.
   But after anti-government dissent was crushed, restrictions on
press visits were relaxed in an effort to demonstate a new policy of
openness and to counter persistant allegations of human rights
abuses.
   The restrictions on press visits have resurfaced at a time when
the pace of political dissent has once again begun to quicken.
   Opposition groups have defied martial law regulations and staged
large rallies demanding democratic rights and an end to military
rule.
   Aung Myint, head of the visa section of the Bangkok embassy said
that the embassy was still accepting applications for visas from
foreign correspondents but he was unable to say whether they would
be approved.
   Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon were also
unable to clarify the position regarding visas for journalists.
   But one official explained that the military government was
annoyed that visiting journalists had interviewed opposition leaders
while ignoring government officials. He asked not to be identified
by name.
   A representative of a travel agency in Bangkok that regularly
arranges visits to Burma, said visas were still being issued to
businessmen, individual tourists and to those travelling in groups.
But all visitors were obliged to arrange a set itinerary with the
state tourism office, she said.

<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen-wheelers filled with electronic
goods and auto parts rumble out of one of the nation's busiest
foreign trade zones and on past high-production farms.
   They roll past shiny aluminum trailer parks for retirees who pump
millions into the economy, past a busy mall and middle-class
neighborhoods.
   Welcome to the nation's poorest metropolitan area.
   The lowest per capita income of the 318 U.S. metropolitan areas
in 1987 _ $7,001 _ was in McAllen-Edinburg-Mission in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, where a boom is taking place amid rural slums where
thousands live in squalor.
   There are other measures of Hidalgo County's poverty: It has the
state's highest unemployment rate, and in March, it shut down its
indigent health care program when it ran out of money halfway
through the fiscal year.
   But local promoters say the gloomy statistics are misleading.
   ``We are a thriving little town,'' said Leonel Garza, president
of the McAllen Board of Realtors Inc. ``I keep hearing we're full of
poverty. I don't know how they figure it.''
   New industries, especially the border plants, maquiladoras, are
drawing so many people that housing values are on the rise. Garza's
group in a May survey found only three houses available for rent in
the city.
   More than $1 billion in goods a year pass through the foreign
trade zone, which has had to turn away tenants since its warehouses
filled up last year.
   Hidalgo County also is the No. 1 destination for 80,000 ``winter
Texans,'' retirees who spent about $161 million last year in
southern Texas.
   And retail sales in the area grew 22.6 percent last year _ faster
than any other part of the state.
   Those statistics also mislead, said economist J. Michael Patrick,
director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Economic Development
at Pan American University in Edinburg. ``Just because we see a lot
of activity in McAllen doesn't mean it's being translated to the
population in a broad sense.''
   The broader population he refers to is found largely in the rural
colonias, where developers have sold tiny home sites without water,
sewers or paved roads for as little as $100 down. A 1986 study for
the Texas Water Development Board found 52,000 people in 366
colonias in Hidalgo County, population 375,000.
   This time of year, many colonia residents are boarding up their
houses to travel north to harvest crops, continuing a cycle of
subsistence living.
   ``We have to get away from migrant work so there will be
stability in the families, so our children will have a full school
year, not half a year,'' said Carmen Anaya, who for 39 years has
lived south of Pharr in a colonia known as Las Milpas.
   The majority of colonia residents are U.S. citizens, said Mrs.
Anaya, who through Valley Interfaith, a coalition of churches, won
legislative approval this session of a $100 million appropriation
for colonia water and sewer installations. The bill was signed into
law by Gov. Bill Clement.
   ``Nobody has sewer service here,'' said Herlinda Hernandez, 65,
who lives with her husband in a cinder-block house in a colonia west
of Mission. Her daughter and grandchildren live in a plywood home in
the front of the same small lot on a street paved with caliche clay.
   Mrs. Hernandez has running water and a septic tank, but fears
that her grandchildren are exposed to chemicals from the
crop-dusting planes that spray a corn field behind her house.
   A neighbor down the street uses an antique wringer washing
machine, while children play in the dusty street.
   Many colonia residents have outhouses that overflow on rainy
days. Even when equipped with septic tanks, many yards end up with
contaminated soil due to poor drainage and lots too small to absorb
the waste.
   That leads to hepatitis, intestinal parasites and typhoid, said
Sister Christine Stephens, chief organizer for Valley Interfaith.
``They live on top of open sewers a lot of the time.''
   The working poor who have no health insurance and make too much
for public health care simply go without, resulting in undetected
cases of diabetes and high blood pressure, Stephens said.
   Like most border areas, prosperity in Hidalgo County is tied to
the maquiladoras, where U.S. products are assembled by Mexican
workers making about $1 an hour. The number of maquiladoras in
Reynosa, Mexico, across from McAllen, increased from 36 to 51
between November 1987 and November 1988, and added more than 5,000
new employees, according to the McAllen Economic Development Corp.
   Yet the county in April had Texas' worst unemployment rate _ 16.7
percent _ more than double the state average of 7 percent and a
point higher than the year before, according to the Texas Employment
Commission.
   The growing unemployment in the face of an industrial boom is
primarily due to a high birthrate and an influx of people into
Hidalgo County, said David Ruelas, Employment Commission labor
market analyst in McAllen.
   To bridge the gap, the McAllen Economic Development Corp. is
trying to attract maquiladora suppliers, companies that would
provide highly paid jobs for skilled labor, said President Mike
Allen.
   But many local communities have high school dropout rates of more
than 50 percent and a shortage of people with industrial experience.
That makes it hard to convince companies they can find people to
fill skilled positions in plastic injection molding and tool-and-die
operations, and most continue to send the supply orders north to
traditionally industrial parts of the United States.

<HEAD>Complete Man of Theater Best Remembered in America for His Film Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Laurence Olivier was a complete man of the
theater who paradoxically scored some of his biggest successes on
screen.
   His career in England spanned all aspects of the stage _ matinee
idol, classical actor supreme, theater director and producer.
   But American audiences remember him best for his movie work,
particularly a trio of romantic films _ ``Wuthering Heights,''
``Rebecca'' and ``Pride and Prejudice'' _ and a series of
Shakespeare adaptations _ ``Henry V,'' ``Hamlet'' and ``Richard
III'' _ that rank among the best ever done on film.
   Olivier, who died Tuesday at 82, was that rare combination, a
superb classical actor and an extraordinary contemporary actor. He
was at home in the plays of Shakespeare, Shaw and Chekhov as well as
in a modern movie thriller like ``Marathon Man'' or a TV miniseries
like ``Brideshead Revisited.''
   ``It would be the equivalent of him being the greatest opera
singer the world has ever known and a great rock star,'' said
Geraldine Fitzgerald, who appeared with him in ``Wuthering Heights''
50 years ago. ``He was great in pop culture, and he was great in
classical culture.''
   Olivier also was an intelligent actor, single-minded in his
intention to give the best performance possible but also inventive
and original in this thinking.
   ``He was one of those very rare actors _ there may be three or
four in a lifetime _ who were touched by the finger of God,'' said
Hume Cronyn, who first met Olivier in the early 1940s through his
wife, Jessica Tandy. ``He had enormous talent, application, looks _
he had it all. He knew how to use it all. And he was immensely
daring. ... There was nothing that Larry could not do.''
   Cronyn once was considering taking a job as artistic director of
a theater company, but told Olivier he was frightened.
   ``If you won't do it, you don't deserve to have it,'' Olivier
said.
   Olivier embraced all types of theater. In 1957, he allied himself
with a wave of British playwrights, particularly John Osborne. He
scored a huge personal triumph as the seedy has-been Archie Rice in
Osborne's ``The Entertainer,'' appearing in the play in London, New
York and on screen.
   ``If the character was a saint, he would find out how to play him
in a truthful, honest way,'' Miss Fitzgerald said. ``If the
character was a villain, he wouldn't imitate what he thought a
villain might be like, he would play his own villainry. He had the
courage to look into the darker sides of himself and then use them
to illuminate the character he was playing.''
   Olivier took chances off-stage, too. He became the first director
of Great Britain's National Theater, guiding it through its
formative years. And he was enormously generous to other actors,
giving newcomers a chance at the theater he ran.
   ``It feels like the end of an era,'' said Jim Dale, who was hired
by Olivier in the early 1970s to star at the National. ``Larry
depicted everything from actor to producer to theater administrator.
What great moments of instruction and theater this man gave us!''
   ``He was sometimes wrong, which was delightful,'' Cronyn said.
``Here he was, God Almighty among actors, and he was wrong.''
   Cronyn recalled agreeing to play in Moliere's ``The Miser.''
   Olivier was disdainful: ``Moliere? Funny as a baby's open grave.''
   ``Boy, was he dead wrong. We brought down the house,'' Cronyn
said.
   To critics who complained about some of the roles Olivier took in
his later years, Cronyn said: ``You get to be an icon, and it's
almost impossible to maintain. Do you want to work or don't you? The
great roles by great playwrights don't come along too often.''
   Cronyn said he once criticized a job Olivier took. ``It's
garbage,'' Olivier agreed. Then why did he take it? ``Dear boy,
they're paying me a fortune.''
   Olivier worked until the end of his life. Even when he was quite
sick, he would take jobs, mostly in television.
   ``However physically frail he was, once he got on camera, he
burned like a fire,'' said Simon Jones, who played Olivier's son in
``Brideshead Revisited.''
   In his maiden speech to the House of Lords in 1971, Olivier said,
``I believe in the theater. I believe in it as the first glamorizer
of thought. It restores dramatic dynamics and their relationships to
life size. ... I believe in anything that will keep our domains, not
wider still and wider, but higher still and higher in the expectancy
and hope of quality and probity.''
   He could have been talking about his own career.

<HEAD>Honecker's Illness Sparks Speculation On Successor, Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker's sudden illness has
provoked speculation about who is next in line for the East German
Communist leadership. Analysts say whoever succeeds the hard-line
Honecker will face powerful pressure to embrace reforms.
   Honecker, 76, was released from a hospital on Monday after
treatment for a gallstone over the weekend, the official news agency
ADN said. He had left a Warsaw Pact meeting in Romania for treatment.
   Honecker, who supervised the building of the Berlin Wall, became
party leader in 1971 and under his guidance East Germany developed
the Soviet bloc's most successful economy.
   But Honecker has rejected the political and economic reforms
sweeping across the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   East Germany has expressed deep concern over the swift pace of
political change in Hungary, warning that opposition forces are
trying to oust the Communist Party from the power.
   At the same time, however, there have been growing street
protests by East German demonstrators calling for more democracy.
   Western anaylsts expect an intense power struggle once Honecker
is no longer in control. But they are pessimistic any of the current
likely contenders would launch immediate reforms that would create a
substantially freer East Germany, which remains one of the most
rigidly controlled states in the Soviet bloc.
   ``There is no full member of the Politburo who understands the
need for political changes in East Germany,'' said Eberhard
Schneider, an expert on East German affairs at the Federal Institute
for Eastern and International Studies in Cologne.
   ``They don't understand it, and they don't want to,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
   Schneider and other observers say it's only a matter of time
before East Germany recognizes it must change its ways, if only for
the sake of keeping up with reformist countries like Hungary and
Poland that are attracting Western investment interest.
   ``The reforming European states in Eastern Europe will be better
partners. It's just easier to cooperate with more open societies,''
said Peter Danylow, an East bloc expert at the German Foundation for
the Study of Foreign Policy in Bonn ``That's a point which should be
clear to East Germany.''
   When Honecker is gone, the analysts say, the prospects of seeing
reform-minded Communist Party members climb to higher positions of
power could dramatically improve.
   Danylow and other experts say it's uncertain who would follow
Honecker, but point out some major contenders.
   The most apparent is Egon Krenz, a 52-year-old member of the
policy-making Politburo and secretary for security matters in the
Central Committee, a powerful position and one held by Honecker
before he took over in 1971.
   ``Krenz represented Honecker on some official visits. That is an
important symbol of power,'' Schneider said.
   Another prospect is Guenter Schabowsky, 60, who holds the key
post of Communist Party chief in Berlin.
   ``I don't think anything major would occur under Krenz. But
perhaps Schabowsky has a little more understanding for what needs to
be done,'' Schneider told the AP.
   The mass-circulation West German newspaper Bild said Monday that
another possible candidate is Siegfried Lorenz, the 59-year-old
party chief in the city of Karl-Marx-Stadt.
   The Politburo has recently stepped up criticism of reformers
within party ranks.
   In one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade, the
Politburo denounced Dresden's party leadership as ``ineffective in
controlling hostile bourgeois activities,'' a reference to growing
street protests by human rights activists for more democracy.
   The 61-year-old Dresden party chief, Hans Modrow, is believed to
have a sympathetic view of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Schneider said Honecker's departure could boost the careers of
reform-minded officials like Modrow.
   He said there was a crop of younger officials, not yet in
positions of real power, who have a keen sense of the need for major
changes.
   ``There are some very good people who understand the problems.
The party must give these people the chance to get to the top,''
Schneider said.

   If you've ever been thrown a curve,
driven up the wall or played the field, you can chalk it up to the
world of sports.
   ``Sports metaphors are everywhere; they permeate all walks of
life,'' said Robert Palmatier, a linguistics professor at Western
Michigan University in Kalamazoo and co-author of a just-released
dictionary of 1,700 sports metaphors.
   The idea for ``Sports Talk: A Dictionary of Sports Metaphors''
came to Palmatier when he found himself behind the eight ball _
literally _ during a game of pool in 1981.
   ``That got me thinking about other pool metaphors _ like being
`on the spot' _ and then I moved to other games,'' he said Tuesday
in a telephone interview.
   ``I was finding them in newspapers, magazines, the backs of
cereal boxes _ and, of course, by listening to people,'' he said.
   Before long he had compiled 1,700 metaphors that have made their
way out of the sports arena.
   ``You can trace sports metaphors back to the 5th century B.C. In
fact, Shakespeare used them in some of his plays,'' said co-author
Harold Ray, a sports historian and physical education professor at
Western.
   ``They've always been used because sports are common to all
cultures,'' Ray said. ``They just make communication easier.''
   Ray said he was most intrigued with the term ``to have a lot of
moxie.''
   ``I always thought of it as having courage when I was growing up.
I never realized it was also the name of a soft drink sold at
baseball stadiums on the East Coast from the late 1800s to the
1920s,'' Ray said.
   Other sports metaphors are better known.
   ``When someone asked you how you made out _ in the old-fashioned
sense _ you'd either say that you struck out or you couldn't get to
first base _ or you scored,'' Palmatier said.
   Teen-age boys aren't the only ones who abuse sports metaphors.
   ``You can't listen to a politician for more than 10 minutes
without hearing a sports metaphor,'' Ray said.
   ``Just yesterday, we saw President Bush playing baseball with
Polish youngsters. I'm sure he used a sports metaphor there
somewhere _ if he takes after his predecessor,'' Ray said. ``And
with all that playing horseshoes, I'm sure it's just a matter of
time before we hear about a `ringer.'''
   President Harry S. Truman made famous the slogan ``The buck stops
here.'' That too has its origin in sports. Specifically, poker.
   The term ``to pass the buck,'' or responsibility, came from the
practice of passing a buck knife to remind a poker player that the
next turn to deal was his, Palmatier said.
   The sport with the most metaphors is boxing, which can be traced
to classical Greece, Palmatier said. Baseball comes in second, with
racing _ horse, car and foot _ in third.
   ``You make a pit stop, spin your wheels or maybe you win by a
nose,'' Palmatier offered as examples.
   Sports writers and spectators take most of the responsibility for
bringing sports metaphors into our everyday life. In at least one
case, the athlete was at fault.
   ``The reason athlete's foot doesn't occur only among athletes is
because one athlete carried it out of the locker room and into his
home,'' Palmatier said.
   There are no plans for a sequel, but since writing the book
Palmatier has been coming across new sports metaphors almost every
day.
   ``I'll be talking to someone and they'll say something came out
of left field,'' Palmatier said. ``It's gotten to the point where I
can't carry on a conversation with someone without taking out a
pencil and notepad.''

   Lifting off on its 32nd mission
after a nearly two-week delay, Europe's Ariane rocket carried a
European experimental telecommunications satellite into space.
   Officials called Tuesday night's launch from this jungle base on
the northeastern shoulder of South America a ``complete success.''
   The Ariane-3 rocket placed the Olympus 1 satellite into orbit.
   Produced by British Aerospace for the European Space Agency, the
5,720-pound communications satellite has a 10-year life.
   It carries a direct broadcast payload with two channels, one for
Italian television, the other for European use.
   The launch originally was scheduled for June 30, but was delayed
by a mechanical problem.
   The Ariane program controls about 50 percent of the
multibillion-dollar market for commercial satellite launches. It
currently has orders for 34 launches together worth about $2.2
billion.
   The program has had four failures since its first launch in
December 1979.

   The following are examples of terms

   ``That's par for the course'' comes from golf.
   To ``strike out'' or ``touch base'' are from baseball.
   To ``have a run-in'' comes from rugby.
   A ``full-court press'' comes from basketball.
   To ``take the ball and run with it'' comes from football.
   To ``come in under the wire'' comes from horse racing. The wire
is above the finish line and is used by those taking pictures of a
``photo finish.''
   To ``take the wind out of someone's sails'' comes from sailing.
If you sail too closely to someone, you deprive them of the wind
they need to sail.
   ``Up to scratch'' comes from boxing in ancient Greece. There was
a line scratched in the dirt, and if a fallen boxer couldn't return
to the line, the match was over.
   A ``showdown'' comes from poker. When the betting is over, the
players still in the game must lay down their cards.
   The ``flip side'' comes from flipping coins, but it's commonly
used by disc jockeys to describe the less popular side of a record.

   The guillotine, the ``lovely invention'' created by
a humanitarian-minded doctor to make execution swift and painless,
is celebrating its 200th birthday this year in official neglect.
   Despite hundreds, even thousands, of bicentennial-related events,
the guillotine itself is nowhere to be seen _ although its image
adorns T-shirts, boxer shorts and other revolutionary souvenirs.
   At least two museums reportedly were asked to put France's two
remaining guillotines on public display, but refused. The machines,
which have not been used since President Francois Mitterrand banned
capital punishment in 1981, ended up in an empty military
installation outside Paris.
   Yet if any single object can be called a popular symbol of
revolutionary France, it is the controversial and hated guillotine.
   It is telling, perhaps, that an authentic guillotine dating to
the revolutionary period was bought at auction last month by a
German collector for about $42,850. The sale attracted little
attention from the French press.
   As bicentennial festivies reach their pinnacle this week,
souvenir shops are overflowing with guillotine-related gadgets, and
tourists are snapping them up fast.
   A gilded model can be had for $58. T-shirts and boxer shorts
emblazoned with its image sell for about $12. Tiny earrings of the
deadly machine are a hot fashion item. Party favors and even a brand
of condoms depict the instrument of execution.
   Better known among Frenchmen as ``la veuve'' _ ``the widow'' _
the guillotine was the invention of Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, who
believed there had to be an alternative to the gruesome, painful and
above all, inefficient execution methods used at the time:
strangling, decapitation by hatchet, and drawing and quartering.
   ``Sirs, with my method, I'll chop off your head with a blink of
an eye, and you won't feel a thing,'' Guillotin, a member of
France's Constituent Assembly, told his colleagues on Dec. 1, 1789.
But there was only laughter, and the project was put aside.
   Over the next two years, another doctor, Antoine Louis, made
improvements on Guillotin's design, and called his invention ``la
louisette.'' It was, in fact, the forerunner of what has become
known today as the guillotine, complete with an oblique blade and a
slot where the victim's head could be immobilized.
   Revolutionary executioner Charles-Henri Sanson, a religious man
and devout monarchist who unwillingly beheaded King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette, welcomed the new invention.
   ``Lovely invention. Provided we don't abuse its convenience,'' he
said after wielding the blade for the first time on April 25, 1792.
   Unfortunately, his warning went unheeded. During Maximilien
Robespierre's 12-month Reign of Terror, 3,000 heads rolled in Paris
alone. By the time revolutionary ardor was spent, 18,000 people,
including women and children, had lost their heads.
   Despite his initial caution, Sanson himself set records of speed
and efficiency, decapitating 21 Girondins in 38 minutes and 15
Danton loyalists in less than half an hour.
   The guillotine, like the Reign of Terror itself, has been hotly
disputed over the years. Rightist philosopher Jean-Marie Benoist
says the carts used to transport victims to the guillotine _ located
at what is now called the Place de la Concorde _ ``prefigure modern
slaughterhouses and concentration camps and announce the advent of
poltical murder.''
   ``Absurd rhetoric,'' counters leftist historian Jean-Noel
Jenneney, named by Mitterrand to oversee the official Bicentennial
Mission.
   ``Compared to the appalling suffering of other methods of
execution, the guillotine represented progress for humanity,'' he
said.

   ON THE ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER (AP) _ The border with Lebanon is
the most dangerous of Israel's frontiers, the target of more than 50
infiltration attempts in the past 18 months by Palestinian gunmen.
   Israeli officials are warning with increasing bluntness that they
are prepared to use whatever force is necessary to protect the farms
and towns nestled along the 100-mile border.
   Speaking on Israel's Arabic language TV program, the government's
coordinator for Lebanon policy suggested Israel would not feel
hampered by U.S. urgings or other restraints.
   ``We strike anywhere we see there is a potential danger for
subversive action against our northern border .... We will strike
without taking into account any unrelated interests,'' said the
official, Uri Lubrani.
   Brig. Gen. Nehemiya, commander of troops in the north, suggested
during a visit to a frontier army base that pre-emptive strikes
would keep Palestinians from taking the initiative and prevent their
rebuilding.
   ``If we feel any organization is preparing an operation against
Israel, it's better to prevent it than wait for them on the
border,'' he said. Under army regulations, Nehemiya's last name and
the location of the army base could not be used.
   Recently, Israeli troops have been moving out of Israel's
self-declared security zone, a two- to 12-mile strip on the Lebanese
side of the border. In one clash, three Palestinian guerrillas were
killed.
   The strip was originally carved out as a six- to 10-mile-wide
buffer zone in 1985 when Israel withdrew the bulk of its 1982
invading force, but current Israeli army and U.N. maps show changes
in the borders of the strip.
   Northern commander Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, said one aim of the
raids was to convince residents not to cooperate with groups hostile
to Israel.
   Israel must ``deter the residents so they will at least not allow
forces to act within their villages because they will be the first
to suffer,'' Peled said on Israel radio.
   In another operation, the army and allied South Lebanon Army
militiamen supported by tanks and artillery staged a show of force
in a zone controlled by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, which
Israeli officials say is helping Palestinians in attacks on Israel.
   Israel's air force has also launched eight air raids in Lebanon
this year, most against Syrian-backed Palestinian groups. Half
occurred in the past six weeks, including one on the Rashadiye
refugee camp only 10 miles north of the border.
   Western diplomats fear escalation could lead to rocket
bombardment from south Lebanon or cross-border terror attacks which
could result in major civilian bloodshed.
   That in turn could harden Israeli public opinion and stymie
efforts to arrange negotiations with Palestinians, especially when
such efforts appear on the verge of collapse.
   ``The peace process can be easily sabotaged. All it would take is
for a guerrilla to get two katyushas and a donkey to carry them. If
by chance the rockets hit a school, that would be it,'' said a
diplomat with long experience in Lebanon who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Since Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism and accepted Israel in December, his Fatah
guerrillas have not attemped any attacks on Israel.
   But more radical groups, both inside and outside the PLO
framework, have mounted raids, which appeared aimed in part at
disrupting the peace efforts.
   Brig. Gen. Nehemiya said that while the frontier with Syria was
potentially the most worrisome, the Lebanon border ``is the most
dangerous border we have now.''
   ``The main threat is that Palestinian guerrilla groups will cross
the border and come to the settlements here, either to kill or to
take hostages and negotiate the release of prisoners.''
   There has been a long history of terror raids prior to Israel's
1982-85 war in Lebanon. In one of the bloodiest attacks, a
three-member Palestinian squad crossed from Lebanon and killed 24
civilians, mostly children, in Maalot in 1974.
   ``I am pleased that in the past three years no civilians have
been killed, but I can't promise it won't happen again,'' said
Nehemiya.
   He said about 50 attempts occurred since the start of the
Palestinian uprising in December, 1987. Only about one in four
groups reached the electronic fence but none succeeded since a
Palestinian in a hang glider killed eight soldiers in northern
Israeli in November 1987.
   According to unofficial count, 29 Palestinians were killed and 17
captured in attempted border raids in 1988 and 25 have been killed
and two wounded so far this year.
   Sources in south Lebanon who demanded anonymity confirmed a
recent report published in London by Jane's Defense Weekly that said
Arafat was building a new ``Palestinian army'' force in refugee
camps near the south Lebanon city of Sidon.
   The purpose is to create a cohesive, better-trained force of
2,000 to 3,000 fighters who would act more like an army and be loyal
to Arafat. Now, about 7,000 to 8,000 fighters in the area are
organized into militias loyal to various Palestinian factions.
   ``For sure, Israel will not let them rebuild,'' said Nehemiya.

<HEAD>Hurricane Season's Third Tropical Depression Forms in Atlantic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third tropical depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season formed off the coast of Africa but showed no signs
of growing into a tropical storm, forecasters said Tuesday.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the depression packed maximum
sustained winds of 35 mph and was located about 625 miles
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, forecasters said.
   The depression's center was located near 21.5 degrees north
latitude and 54 degrees west longitude, and was moving
west-northwest towards the Lesser Antilles at 13 mph, said
forecaster Hal Gerrish at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   The depression, which formed late Monday night, was not expected
to strengthen significantly Wednesday, Clark said.
   If the depression gathers sustained winds of 39 mph, it would be
named Tropical Storm Barry. Tropical Storm Allison, the first named
storm of the season, caused widespread flood damage in Texas last
month.

   Let them decorate cake in Chicago, storm the Bastille in
Louisiana, sprint while balancing bottles of sparkling water in
Boston: vive la revolution en Amerique.
   New York, home to an estimated 15,000 French citoyens, has been a
flurry of activity this year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the French revolution. There have been French films, an opera
written by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, dance and music
concerts.
   The French consul general, Benoit d'Adoville, will be host of a
reception on Friday, the day the French celebrate the storming of
the Bastille, the prison that was a symbol of autocratic oppression.
   In California, the Sacramento Symphony is holding a champagne
dance Friday, followed two days later by the ``Le Tour de San
FRANCEcisco'' bike race. The French government estimates that 25,000
French expatriates live in the Bay area.
   Emmanuel Gagniarre, a French consulate spokesman in New York,
says he's at a loss to list all the U.S. events planned to
commemorate the French revolution.
   ``In the United States, there are so many things,'' he said.
``There are so many historic events and values linking the two
nations,'' he said.
   Gagniarre noted that the U.S. Bill of Rights was presented to
Congress in 1789, the year the French Declaration of the Rights of
Man and Citizen was promulgated. Thomas Jefferson was U.S. envoy to
France at the time.
   On Boston Common, a site important to the history of the American
Revolution, waiters carrying bottles of sparkling water will compete
in a Bastille Day footrace.
   New Orleans, ever proud of its French heritage, plans a two-mile
cross-country race. The first 100 finishers will be awarded a bottle
of wine.
   New Orleans also offers something for counterrevolutionaries: a
Napoleon and Josephine look-alike contest.
   The town of Kaplan, deep in French-speaking Louisiana, has had
Bastille Day celebrations since 1906, but ``it's special this year
because of the bicentennial,'' said Janet Merritt, chairwoman of
this year's July 13-16 fete. Activities in Kaplan include a
recreation of the storming of the Bastille.
   Eric Falt, a spokesman for the French consulate in Chicago, said
he saw the same sense of fraternity in France when the United States
celebrated its bicentennial.
   ``I think this year is very comparable to 1976,'' Falt said.
``I'm very surprised. I just moved here from France. And I'm very
happy about it.''
   Falt said he expects thousands of Chicagoans to attend a Bastille
Day street fair along Michigan Avenue. It is one of some 50 events
scheduled in the Chicago area this month, including a pastry contest
for children whimsically named ``Let Them Decorate Cake.''
   Not all the commemorations are so lighthearted. In Miami, the
Cuban Museum of Art and Culture plans an exhibit of photographs this
month on ``the first revolution for the rights of man.''
   ``All the revolutions in Latin America were influenced directly
by the American Revoluton and the ideas of the French philosphers of
the 18th and 19th centuries,'' said museum director Carlos Luis.
``We are celebrating 200 years of the ideas of freedom and
tolerance.''

   The case of the purloined parrot ended happily
nearly two weeks after the birdnapping of Magda Wilson's 43-year-old
feathered friend.
   The 80-year-old Ms. Wilson on Monday night was reunited with her
Amazon parrot named Baby, thanks to some amateur detective work.
   ``I was so happy, I just can't tell you,'' Ms. Wilson said
Tuesday. ``When I first saw him, I just wanted to take him and run.
I didn't want to talk to anybody. Just run.''
   Ms. Wilson said Baby, whose wings are clipped, was stolen July 1
from her perch outside her Santa Monica home. She told police she
had seen a man in a red jacket in the area minutes before she
realized Baby was missing.
   Ms. Wilson got Baby 39 years ago, and the two have kept each
other company since Ms. Wilson's husband died in 1971.
   News reports of Baby's disappearance reached a woman who said she
was approached by a man trying to sell a parrot matching Baby's
description.
   The woman told Ms. Wilson she had refused to buy the bird because
she thought it was stolen, but that she knew a man who did buy it.
   At first, Ms. Wilson didn't know what to think.
   ``Those last few days I was getting very unsure about things,''
she said. ``I didn't know if I'd ever see him.''
   But with the woman's help, Ms. Wilson tracked down the man with
the bird, and a meeting was arranged for Monday night.
   Ms. Wilson drove to the site with family members and a police
officer, and sure enough, the man had her Baby.
   They gave him the $100 he paid for the bird and gave an $80
reward to the woman tipster.
   No arrest was made because there was no evidence the man
knowingly bought a stolen bird, said Santa Monica police Lt. Richard
Johncola.
   When Ms. Wilson got home, she pulled out the cage she had put in
storage because she couldn't bear to see it empty.
   Baby hopped back in.
   ``I'm so very happy now, you couldn't believe it. He's finally
back,'' she said.

   President Bush's stops in Poland and now
Hungary present contrasts between this quiet, graceful city along
the fabled Danube River and the northern Polish port of Gdansk, with
its gray dockside cranes poised like dinosaurs on a smoggy skyline.
   Shops here, unlike in Poland and other communist European
countries, are well stocked with products and unabashedly Western
commercial interests are much in evidence. The gleaming McDonald's
in downtown Budapest ranks as a trendy watering hole, while the
Adidas store offers the same fashions and goods available in New
York or Munich.
   Budapest is a city of jagged cliffs and spectacular bridges and
monuments, with the Danube quietly flowing down the middle. When the
lights come on at night, young couples amble along the river, giving
off a feeling of a kind of Belle Epoque that many Americans
associate with the Old World.
   The city's grace _ which persists despite delays in much-needed
building restoration _ is in sharp contrast to the gritty industrial
feel of Gdansk, the Polish shipbuilding center where Bush met with
Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa on Tuesday.
   Hungarians are proud of their moves toward a free-market economy,
including a fledgling stock exchange and a wealth of pamphlets and
other materials trumpeting their progress.
   Two young Budapest men showed off the country's enterprising
spirit to good advantage shortly before Bush arrived from Poland.
   Without waiting for the necessary permit from city authorities,
Laszlo Halnai and Peter Lakos set up a life-size, stand-up portrait
of a smiling Bush and charged Hungarian passersby 200 forints, the
equivalent of $3.30, for a Polaroid snapshot with the country's
distinguished guest.
   And a local English-language radio station touts the latest in
investment opportunities _ a capitalist twist that still seems out
of place despite the enormous changes sweeping across the Soviet
bloc.
   Hungary embarked on pioneering economic reforms that gave its
capital this gloss by the 1970s. But then foreign loans were
increasingly squandered on unprofitable state-run enterprises,
putting a brake on change.
   Now, the ruling Communist Party is itself the motor for a push
toward a free market economy and is negotiating with mushrooming
democratic opposition groups over multi-party elections next year.
   Like Poland, Hungary is crying out for more capitalist investment
_ and on the surface at least seems to be doing a much better job
than Warsaw.
   But both nations are weighted down with foreign debts, and both
have been forced to let building renovation take a secondary role to
providing the necessities of life.
   Cars and trucks belching fumes from cheap, Soviet bloc gasoline
crowd the streets of Warsaw, Gdansk and Budapest alike. Young,
stylishly dressed girls walk arm-in-arm alongside stooped older
women still attired in drab dresses and fading headscarves.
   But while Poland lags economically, it has a reform rallying
point in the labor federation Solidarity. Red-and-white banners with
the ragged Solidarity script are as much a part of the Polish
landscape as the box-like Polski Fiats.
   Some constants of Soviet bloc life remain in both countries.
   In both Poland and Hungary, young couples can wait up to 20 years
just to jam themselves and their families into small apartments _ if
their marriages survive the preceding decades with their parents or
in-laws in equally cramped quarters.

   President Bush's meetings today with
Hungary's four leaders give him a firsthand glimpse of the political
merry-go-round that is fast changing the face of this nation.
   Bruno F. Straub, a 75-year-old biologist who a year ago became
Hungary's first non-communist president since 1948, hosted Bush's
official welcoming ceremonies and a state dinner Tuesday in
parliament.
   But Straub is basically a ceremonial figure, so dinner remarks
came from Rezso Nyers, an economist who was appointed communist
chairman June 24 when Hungary's squabbling ruling party named a
four-man leadership to try to unite its members.
   Aside from Nyers, the four-man leadership includes Prime Minister
Miklos Nemeth, the country's most outspoken communist reformer, Imre
Pozsgay, and party general secretary Karoly Grosz, who was named
party chief in May 1988 but increasingly faced calls for his ouster
from more radical reformers.
   The decision to name the four-man leadership was a compromise
between the increasingly powerful advocates of political and
economic reform and the more orthodox Marxists in the ruling party's
ranks.
   Each of the four men is seen as fulfilling his own role in trying
to maintain the unity of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, as
the ruling communists are formally known here, until a party
congress chooses new leaders in October.
   Nyers, who is 66, is a one-time Social Democrat who joined
communist ranks after the communist takeover in 1948. He was a
ranking party member during the repressions that followed the
unsuccessful anti-Stalinist revolt of 1956, which was crushed by
Kremlin troops and tanks.
   Considered the ``father'' of Hungary's pioneering economic
reforms in the late 1960s, Nyers fell from favor when he pushed for
more reform. He was ousted from the party's ruling Politburo in 1975
amid rumors that then-party leader Janos Kadar was under pressure
from Moscow to block further changes.
   Nyers made a stunning East bloc political comeback when Kadar was
ousted as party chief in May 1988, winning back a seat on the
Politburo.
   He increasingly sided with Pozsgay and other reformers and
emerged as the new compromise candidate to lead the party in June.
He is seen as a figure who is both a reformer and yet can still
placate old-time comrades with whom he has ties stretching back
decades.
   Pozsgay shot up in popular esteem last January when he became the
first public leader to proclaim that the 1956 revolt was a popular
uprising and not a counterrevolution, as it had officially been
termed for more than 32 years.
   A 56-year-old communist who had an unspectacular career until
about three years ago, Pozsgay has been the most outspoken proponent
of multi-party democracy and is a member of the party team
negotiating next year's free elections with the opposition groups.
   Nemeth, a frequent tennis partner of U.S. Ambassador Mark Palmer,
speaks for the younger party technocrats whose careers are untouched
by the wounds of 1956 and the repressions that followed. They rose
in the relative consumer wealth and openness to the outside world
achieved under Kadar in the 1970s and are anxious to right their
country's economic woes _ a $17 billion foreign debt, looming
unemployment and double-digit inflation.
   Grosz, 58, is still thought to have a strong voice amid party
bureaucrats of his age.
   But he lost much of the goodwill surrounding his rise a year ago
with a series of contradictory statements on key policy issues, such
as the new standing of Imre Nagy, the executed leader of the 1956
revolt who was reburied as a martyr and pioneer of reform communism
last month.
   The man most strikingly absent from Hungary's political scene
during Bush's visit is the lion-faced Kadar, who dominated his
country for 32 years and died last Thursday. Black flags hang from
every public building in his memory, and he will be cremated Friday
with full honors _ although many of his policies are now being
revised.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Do Americans Tell Cows How To Eat?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the minor mysteries of President
Bush's trip to Eastern Europe is this: Does he really think
Americans are fond of saying that you shouldn't tell a cow how to
eat cabbage?
   Bush suggested to a group of Hungarian journalists that the line
about cows and cabbage is a common saying in the United States. The
journalists, in turn, sent his words to newspapers here.
   Now, perhaps everybody in Hungary is talking about the way
Americans won't tell their cows how to munch cabbage.
   This strange business began in the Oval Office last week when
Bush was discussing his trip with the Hungarian reporters. Bush, who
has praised democratic reforms here, was asked if the United States
would be equally happy if a leftist-communist-socialist coalition
was elected.
   The president said, in part, ``It would be inappropriate for the
president of the United States to try to fine-tune for the people of
Hungary how they ought to eat _ how the cow ought to eat the
cabbage, as we say in the United States.''
   Bush likes offbeat sayings, such as describing a person who's a
phony or a bluffer as ``all hat and no cattle.'' That term comes
from his years in Texas. Though not often heard around the White
House, it is arguably understandable.
   But the cows and cabbage remark confused even top White House
aides.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, gave
a blank stare when asked if he knew what the saying meant.
   Informed it was something Bush had said, Scowcroft said Bush's
line may not be exactly right but added: ``There is something about
cows eating cabbage.'' He said he'd look into it.
   David Demarest, director of White House communications, said
Bush's comment rang a bell. ``I'm familiar with a saying like that,
but not exactly that saying.''
   Roger Porter, Bush's adviser on domestic and economic policy,
admitted he'd never heard such a saying.
   And a Texan who works in the White House _ and who will be
unnamed here _ said he was familiar with a line that sounds like the
flip side of what Bush said.
   Once you've explained to someone how something is done, the Texan
said, you can say, ``I told him how the cow ate the cabbage.'' He
didn't know why people say that, he said they just do.
   The final judge of the cow and cabbage caper is John Sununu, the
White House chief of staff.
   He was asked in a television interview what Bush meant by his
line.
   Sununu's first reaction was to laugh.
   ``That's an old Walker Point saying,'' he joked, referring to the
Bush family's seaside compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   More seriously, Sununu offered a 171-word explanation, containing
such pithy phrases as the United States' not wanting ``to define the
final format of the internal structures'' that other countries
should adopt.
   Compared with Sununu's verbiage, Bush's words seemed to take on
new clarity. He was saying the United States wasn't going to butt in
too much.
   One other curiosity from this trip: the president's wife,
Barbara, thinks that Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski is a funny
fellow.
   Jaruzelski, of course, is the man who imposed martial law in 1981
to crush the Solidarity union and imprison its leaders. Lately,
though, he has sanctioned democratic reforms that resulted in
sweeping election victories by Solidarity.
   Even so, Jaruzelski is generally regarded as colorless and stiff.
Mrs. Bush sat next to him at a luncheon Monday.
   ``He was very funny, very amusing,'' she recalled.
   When President Bush suggested that guests shed their coats in the
warm temperatures, Jaruzelski told Mrs. Bush he had to sneak away
and remove his suspenders as well, because he didn't want them to
show.
   ``So when he had to get up to make his speech, he said, `Well, I
better be careful (that his trousers don't fall). I've gotta
remember I don't have my suspenders on,''' Mrs. Bush related.

   A fire extinguisher that couldn't take the
heat burst and put out a small fire at a day care center, said
firefighters who raced to the scene but were never needed.
   ``Unbelievable,'' said fire Lt. Ed Murray. ``Someone was watching
over the building, because the fire already started.''
   The extinguisher dangled from a nail above a table fan that
short-circuited and caught fire Monday night. The extinguisher
ruptured from the heat and sprayed its chemical contents all over
the smoke-filled room, Murray said.
   Firefighters ran into the Carousel Nursery School with hose
stretched, ready to battle a blaze originally reported with flames
shooting through the windows.
   ``They were very surprised. They felt the heat and couldn't find
the fire,'' said Murray, a 25-year veteran of fighting fires.
   The fire caused about $3,000 in damage.

   A Secret Service officer at the White House
said he accepted an $8,000 Rolex watch from a Washington lobbyist
who asked him to intervene in a drunken driving arrest, The
Washington Post reported.
   The Post, in Wednesday's editions, quoted Officer Ronald A.
deGueldre as saying that he accepted the watch from lobbyist Craig
J. Spence, who has been linked with an alleged homosexual
prostitution ring. The drunken driving arrest was made by the Secret
Service.
   DeGueldre said he ``talked to my superiors the next day and
informed them that this was a guy with a lot of clout. That's the
last I ever heard of it.'' The Post said court records showed that
two weeks later, district prosecutors dropped the charge of driving
under the influence.
   DeGueldre, reached by telephone Tuesday night by The Associated
Press, refused to comment and hung up on a reporter.
   The District of Columbia Office of Corporation Counsel said
Tuesday the case was dropped because it was ``without merit,'' but
would not give details, the Post said.
   The paper said deGueldre denied allegations contained in a sworn
statement by a Secret Service investigator that he admitted stealing
several pieces of the valuable Truman china collection from a pantry
in the White House living quarters, giving one piece to Spence and
several to members of deGueldre's family.
   The Secret Service said the officer admitted stealing two sets of
presidential cufflinks and tie tacks from the basement office of
Rose Zamaria, director of White House operations.
   The Post interviewed deGueldre, who denied committing any thefts
or doing favors for Spence. Spence has not responded to requests for
interviews, the newspaper said.
   Federal authorities are investigating Spence's relationship with
government employees, including the Secret Service officer. The
probe is tied to an investigation of possible credit card fraud by
an alleged homosexual prostitution service broken up by local and
federal agents in February.
   The Washington Times has reported that Spence was a client of the
prostitution service.
   In the Post interview, deGueldre said Spence telephoned him after
being arrested on Jan. 20, 1988, for alleged drunken driving. After
talking with his superiors, deGueldre said the charges against
Spence were dropped on Feb. 5, 1988, the day of his scheduled court
appearance.
   DeGueldre told the Post he took Spence and several friends on an
evening tour of the White House on the weekend of Independence Day
1988, and that same weekend, ``Spence said we should swap watches,
and I gave him my $22 Casio and he gave me the $8,000 Rolex. It was
a friendship thing, not to do anything for him.''

<TEXT>
   The founder of the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, which staged huge demonstrations at the Democratic National
Convention last summer, was arrested on charges stemming from the
protests.
   Randall Terry was arrested Monday after he finished an appearance
before the Christian Booksellers Association to promote his book
``Operation Rescue,'' an account of the group's history and mission.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Joseph Foreman said Terry was a
``political prisoner.'' The Binghamton, N.Y.-based group has
sponsored numerous demonstrations nationwide.
   Foreman said there were no plans to post the $50,000 bond to
release Terry, who was charged with one count of being party to a
crime and three counts of criminal trespass stemming from last
summer's Operation Rescue demonstrations outside Atlanta abortion
clinics.
   The bond was raised when he failed to appear for a court hearing
on the charges in February. Another arrest warrant containing the
same four charges was issued for Terry after that hearing.
   Atlanta lawyer Robert Fierer said that if Terry had had a court
date and he had been aware of it, he or somebody from his office
would have attended it.
   ``We were totally unaware of that,'' said Fierer, who no longer
represents Operation Rescue but said he has been in touch with Terry
since the arrest.
   Fierer, who represented the group after hundreds of its members
were arrested at the Democrats' convention last summer, said the
cases now involve 1,500 people and had ``become a tremendous
administrative nightmare for us.''
   Attorney, Jay Sekulow, who is handling Terry's case, said he,
too, was unaware of any outstanding warrants.
   Terry's wife, Cindy, said she and her husband knew he might be
arrested.
   ``It's a possibility in a lot of cities,'' she said. ``We don't
know why Atlanta would pick this time, this place.''

   Two men who played Munchkins in ``The
Wizard of Oz'' on Tuesday challenged an account by another man who
said he also was a Munchkin in the film classic.
   Two of the 26 surviving Munchkin actors and Steve Cox, the author
of ``The Munchkins Remembered _ The Wizard of Oz and Beyond,'' said
Dale Paullin was not a member of the cast. Cox called The Associated
Press after reading an AP interview with Paullin.
   ``I'd stake my reputation on it that he was not a Munchkin,'' Cox
said in a telephone interview from his home near St. Louis. ``It's
simple, he wasn't there.''
   Paullin responded, ``I know where I've been.'' He maintains he
was an original Munchkin and recently was hired to promote the
release of the movie's uncut version on video.
   ``I can't figure it out,'' Paullin said. ``I know where I was and
that's it.''
   Margaret Pellegrini of Glendale, Ariz., who played one of the
Sleepy Head Munchkins, said Paullin ``is not and was not a
Munchkin.''
   Jerry Maren of Hollywood, Calif., who as a Lollipop Guild member
presented a lollipop to ``Wizard of Oz'' star Judy Garland in the
1939 movie, also said Paullin was not a cast member.

<TEXT>
   House tax-writers, under orders to find an
extra $5.3 billion to reduce the deficit, are casting an eye toward
pipe smokers, telephone users, air travelers and lenders.
   Those groups would pay more tax under a proposal by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee. But most of the three dozen-plus recommendations that he
presented to the panel Tuesday are highly technical changes
affecting few ordinary taxpayers.
   During the budget year that begins Oct. 1, Rostenkowski's plan
would produce just the amount of new revenue envisioned under a
deficit-reduction agreement between Congress and the Bush
administration.
   Although the plan would require various groups to pay more money
to the federal government, apparently no part of it is a general tax
increase that would be viewed as conflicting with President Bush's
pledge to oppose any tax increase.
   Rostenkowski did not ask for a cut in the capital gains tax rate,
as Bush has proposed.
   There is general agreement that a reduction in that rate, which
affects profits from the sale of stock and other assets, would
actually increase tax collections for a year. But Rostenkowski has
been unable to convince a majority of Democrats on his committee to
agree to a tax change that would mainly benefit upper-income
Americans.
   The committee, meeting behind closed doors, is expected to spend
several days on Rostenkowski's proposals and on various tax-cut
suggestions and ways to pay for them.
   The provision in Rostenkowski's plan affecting the most people
would extend for one year the 3 percent tax on local and
long-distance telephone service. Without congressional action, the
tax would disappear after Dec. 31, 1990. Bush wants to make the tax
permanent.
   Extending the tax would raise $1.6 billion in the 1991 fiscal
year.
   Similarly, present law would cut in half various aviation taxes,
including the 8 percent levy on tickets, the tax on aviation fuel
and the tax on air shipments. Rostenkowski's proposal would keep the
taxes at present levels for another year.
   The biggest chunk of revenue under Rostenkowski's proposal would
come from repealing a provision that permits banks and other lenders
to avoid tax on half the interest earned on loans used to finance
employee stock-ownership plans. The change would raise $1.3 billion
in 1990 and $10.2 billion over five years.
   Also, the deduction allowed employers for certain dividends paid
on securities held by those plans would be repealed. This would
raise $368 million this year and almost $3 billion over five years.
   Rostenkowski says the ESOP provisions are being abused by some
corporate executives to protect their companies from takeover.
   Other items in Rostenkowski's plan and the money they would raise
in 1990 include:
   _Boosting to $2.67 a pound the tax on pipe tobacco (now 45
cents), chewing tobacco (now 8 cents) and snuff (now 24 cents). The
new figure is equivalent to the cigarette tax of 16 cents a pack.
$105 million.
   _A tax increase of 3 cents per barrel of domestic crude oil and
imported oil, with the $69 million pulled in earmarked for cleaning
up oil spills.
   _Withholding income taxes from wages paid any farm worker who
already is subject to withholding of Social Security taxes or who
works for an employer more than 20 days a year. $270 million.
   _Repealing what remains of the ``completed-contract'' method of
accounting, under which some big defense contractors and
construction companies avoid tax on a project until it is completed.
$171 million.
   _Permitting employers limited use of excess pension-plan assets
to finance health benefits for retirees. $286 million.
   _Requiring that certain types of deferred compensation be subject
to Social Security taxes, raising $400 million. The change would
result in payment of higher Social Security benefits to people who
pay the higher tax. In 1990 those benefits would cost $90 million;
after five years the plan would cost Social Security more than it
would bring in.
   _Requiring that the federal gasoline tax be collected at an
earlier point in the distribution chain, from the terminal owner.
That would reduce opportunities for tax evasion and raise $117
million.

<TEXT>
   Pickets marched in front of District Attorney
Harry Connick's office Tuesday and the American Civil Liberties
Union promised to fight Connick's efforts to revive Louisiana's ban
on abortions.
   ``Louisiana is a major battleground,'' said Shirley Pedler,
director of the Louisiana ACLU chapter. ``It is the first state to
try to criminalize abortion, even without grounds to do so. Public
officials don't seem to be under the law.''
   Pedler spoke to reporters during a news conference at a New
Orleans abortion clinic.
   Earlier Tuesday, a half-dozen members of a New Orleans chapter of
the National Organization for Women marched in front of Connick's
office to protest his plans.
   Among the pickets was a 10-year-old girl wielding a large placard
reading: ``Harry, you oppressor.''
   Connick on Monday asked a federal district judge to lift a 1976
injunction against enforcement of a law making performing an
abortion a criminal offense.
   Under the law, a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable
for punishment, only the person who performs the procedure.
   Judge Martin Feldman will hold a hearing on the matter Aug. 9.
   Connick said he had no plans to try to immediately enforce the
law.
   The Supreme Court's July 3 decision upholding Missouri
restrictions on abortion prompted Connick's action. Connick said the
decision leaves open the possibility that further restrictions could
be ruled legal.
   Connick said in a broadcast interview Tuesday he hoped his
actions would hasten a decision by the high court to uphold or
overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case upholding a woman's right to
abortion.
   ``Why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another
shoe to fall?'' Connick said.
   Pedler said the ACLU will argue at the Aug. 9 hearing that the
injunction barring enforcement of Louisiana's law should not be
lifted as long as Roe vs. Wade is intact.

   An infant was born with a bullet in her
chest after her mother was shot, but the child's most serious injury
was a broken rib and she was in stable condition Tuesday. Her mother
also was recovering.
   Despite breaking a rib, the small-caliber bullet lodged just
under the skin and did not damage internal organs, said Dee Denton,
a spokeswoman for Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, where the
slug was removed.
   The baby's mother, Evelyn Page, 31, also was in stable condition
Tuesday at Regional Medical Center here. She was eight months
pregnant when shot by an unknown assailant Saturday. The baby was
delivered by Caesarean section.
   ``I knew my baby had been shot, the way my baby started moving in
me,'' she said. ``My baby started moving real fast. She kicked the
whole time. I knew that bullet had hit her.''
   ``What should I name her? Miracle Baby or what? That's what I was
thinking about, because she is a miracle baby,'' Ms. Page said.
   Ms. Page told police she was walking along a street early
Saturday when a man in a car stopped and told her to get in.
   ``I said, `You don't look right, I'm not getting in the car with
you,' and he reached down and pulled out a gun,'' she said. ``He
just shot me out of the clear sky.''
   She said the bullet went through her left arm and through her
side before hitting her fetus, but she was able to walk to a nearby
store and ask for help.
   ``I'm living. My baby's living. I thank the Lord it happened like
that,'' she said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gay rights legislation was passed Tuesday in the
Massachusetts Senate, and advocates of homosexual rights said they
expect a tough fight when it comes up for final reading this fall.
   The legislation, approved 24-15, would ban discrimination against
gays and lesbians in housing, credit, employment and public
accommodations.
   ``This is the big vote we've been pushing for,'' said David
LaFontaine of the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. ``This
is an overwhelming mandate from the Senate.''
   The bill still needs final Senate approval, and is expected to
come up for a vote this fall. It was passed by the House in March.
   The vote came with almost no debate. The chamber rejected three
amendments proposed by state Sen. Edward Kirby that would have
weakened the bill or included anti-gay language.
   ``We're only halfway there,'' said state Sen. Michael Barrett,
the bill's Senate sponsor. ``I anticipate a very tough fight in the
fall.''
   This year, as in past sessions, the legislation was stalled by
procedural tactics employed by its opponents. Kirby kept the
legislation off the Senate floor for weeks by proposing amendments,
then invoking a rule that requires at least a day's delay to allow
the amendment to be printed on the Senate calendar.
   But this week, Senate President William Bulger, who has not been
viewed as a supporter of the gay rights bill, pushed through a rules
suspension that prevented opponents from gaining time-consuming
delays.
   ``He deserves some credit for rising above his personal feelings
on this,'' LaFontaine said.
   Tuesday's vote sent the legislation to the Senate Committee on
Bills in Third Reading, a way station for legislation before final
debate. In 1987, committee rules were used to tie up the gay rights
bill in committee until the session expired.
   This year, committee Chairman William Q. MacLean said he would
refrain from using procedural moves to block the bill, even though
he voted against it.
   MacLean said 1989 may be the year the bill becomes law. ``Based
on the head count, you have to say it looks like there is a strong
possibility of it.''

   A cast change moved the Kirov Ballet's Altynai
Asylmuratova from the Monday to the Tuesday ``The Sleeping Beauty,''
and the scramble was on for Tuesday tickets. Miss Asylmuratova is,
indeed, a glowing Princess Aurora.
   She's a lyrical dancer, whose dancing spins a long, lovely
phrase. She doesn't dance fast. Her balance is good _ Princess
Aurora constantly is being asked to balance _ but it isn't rock
solid.
   She looks like a human being capable of a catchable waver.
   The famous ``Rose Adagio'' ends with each of four suitors taking
the princess' hand and turning her in a circle. On Tuesday, at the
Metropolitan Opera, Miss Asylmuratova realized either that she
didn't have time or didn't have balance. She didn't turn for the
final suitor and he, catching on fast, dipped her into a position
that looked like an appropriate ending.
   She smiled dazzlingly at the prince in the last act wedding
scene. But earlier, while being courted by the four suitors, she
presented a ballerina instead of a girl on her 16th birthday.
   Konstantin Zaklinsky merits high praise for technique and
deportment as the prince.
   Lyubov Kunakova as the Lilac Fairy is a strong dancer, not at all
ethereal but since she's primarily the person in charge, it's
appropriate. The Lilac Fairy not only makes the princess sleep
instead of die from the evil fairy's curse and guides the prince to
her palace, but apparently she performs the wedding.
   The corps de ballet looked wonderful. It's a beautiful
production, with attractive costumes and old-master-style painted
backdrops giving an illusion of deep distance.
   The character dances at the wedding celebration don't include a
troupe of Russians in this Russian version. Albert Mirzoyan as
Puss-in-Boots had some amusing gestures flexing his paws at the tall
White Cat, Elvira Krylova.
   Andrei Garbuz and Yelena Pankova were deft and fast in the
Bluebird pas de deux, yet failed to excite. Maybe it was because
orchestral tempos, as conducted by Dzhemal Dalgat, kept fluctuating.
   Thus far in the engagement, the Kirov Ballet has been slightly
disappointing. This may be the fault of a viewer, from an inflated
memory of what one saw on its last visit 25 years ago, or from an
unreasonable desire to have each evening of ballet top the last one.
   ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' with choreography by Petipa and music by
Tchaikovsky, had its premiere in St. Petersburg in 1890.

   Financier Sir James Goldsmith and fellow bidders
will have to raise their record-breaking $21 billion securities
offer for BAT Industries PLC and throw in some cash to succeed in
the hostile takeover attempt for the giant conglomerate, analysts
say.
   The highly leveraged offer, announced Tuesday, might be a move by
the bidders to beat the bushes for backers _ and for competing
bidders for the company, whose U.S. holdings include the Saks Fifth
Avenue stores and Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., one analyst
said.
   BAT's cigarette brands include Benson and Hedges, Kent and Kool.
   The acquisition would be the largest ever in Europe and the
second-biggest worldwide, eclipsed only by the $25 billion takeover
of RJR Nabisco Inc. by the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., which was completed earlier this year.
   The investment group, Hoylake Investments PLC, offered 850 pence,
the equivalent of $13.86, in debt instruments for each share of BAT,
Britain's third-largest company.
   Hoylake, which owns about 1.25 percent of the BAT's stock, said
it intends to break up London-based BAT, which has interests in
tobacco, financial services, retailing and paper.
   Hoylake also includes Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer and
British investor Jacob Rothschild, a member of the famous banking
family.
   BAT, the world's biggest tobacco company, said it would fight the
bid, which it called ``an ill-conceived attempt at destructive
financial engineering.''
   ``This is just the opening shot,'' said Mike Simmonds, head of
British research at Yamaichi International Ltd.
   Charles Pick, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute, said,
``The offer in its present form hasn't got a hope of winning.''
   Bruce Davidson, an analyst with Smith New Court PLC, said, ``My
guess is that it has been launched to see if anyone else is going to
compete, or possibly to line up a cash alternative by feeling out
fund managers.''
   BAT shares finished well above the offered price Tuesday on
London's Stock Exchange, indicating that the market was expecting a
higher bid to emerge.
   BAT has diversified away from tobacco in recent years to reduce
its exposure to that sluggish business.
   Goldsmith said that by selling BAT's non-tobacco businesses he
intended to unlock ``shareholder value.'' Among the non-tobacco
units he would sell is Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles,
which BAT acquired for $5.2 billion in cash last year after a long
takeover fight.
   BAT's other subsidiaries include British-American Tobacco Co.
Ltd., BATUS Inc., Marshall Field and Co., Argos Distributors,
Appleton Papers Inc., Wiggins Teape Group, J.B. Ivey and Co. and
Eagle Star Holdings PLC.

   The Rolling Stones are returning to the road
after an eight-year layoff, but members of the self-proclaimed
world's greatest rock 'n' roll band say they're not coming back to
make a quick buck.
   ``That's The Who!'' guitarist Ron Wood explained Tuesday in
joining bandmates Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Bill Wyman and
Charlie Watts to announce a 29-city North American tour to promote a
new album, ``Steel Wheels.''
   ``This tour is not historical ... I don't see it as a
retrospective tour, I don't see it as a farewell tour. It's the
Rolling Stones in 1989,'' Jagger told a media horde in Grand Central
Terminal.
   The band's last album was 1986's ``Dirty Work,'' which was
followed by three years of internal strife and a rumored band
break-up.
   Jagger and Richards, the focus of the rift, hugged and mugged
when asked if they had patched up their differences.
   ``The answer to that is we both gave up masochism,'' said
Richards,
   No financial details were announced about the tour, which opens
Sept. 1 in Buffalo, but Rolling Stone magazine has reported the band
signed a $65 million tour deal.

   American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne got a warm
reception at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden,
singing one of her best roles there for the first time.
   ``I was thrilled, especially with all those young people down in
front,'' she said Tuesday night after being cheered by 700
promenaders sitting on the floor for her title role as Isabella in
Rossini's ``L'Italiana in Algeri.''
   On some summer evenings, a British bank pays the opera house to
remove some seats and lay a carpet for the youngsters to sit on.
They stand in line for tickets at $8 instead of the usual $81 and
$103.
   Ms. Horne, 60, who lives in New York City, first sang Isabella in
1964 with the San Francisco Opera.

   Merv Griffin was up to his old tricks,
playing TV host to a nostalgic visit for the days when big bands and
bobby-soxers were the kings and queens of ballroom entertainment.
   To the customers who've packed the Superstar Theater in
Griffin-owned Resorts International casino-hotel for a chance to see
him in person and have a crack at winning a car or cash, the
combination variety-game shows were little more than a novelty.
   But as chairman of Merv Griffin Enterprises, a subsidiary of
Columbia Entertainment, Griffin sees the show as the foundation for
a new nationally televised variety-game show originating from his
casino-hotel on the Boardwalk.
   ``It's something that's never been done before, entertainment
co-mingling with a game show,'' he said.
   If the show does become go on television regularly, don't expect
to see the 64-year-old Griffin install himself as host. ``I just
want to perfect it, get it right and then turn it over to someone
else to host,'' he said.

   Eyes were riveted when, stiletto-heeled
and wrapped in a skin-tight leotard, Oscar-winning actress Cher
accompanied members of the band Bon Jovi to the cinema.
   ``At 12:15 a van whipped into the parking lot. In walked Cher,''
theater manager Dan O'Neil said. ``I was in shock. She wasn't
wearing any makeup, but she still looked like she was 20 years old.''
   She and the band rented the Apple Tree Mall Cinema IV theater for
a private showing of ``Lethal Weapon II'' early Saturday. Cher is
dating Bon Jovi guitarist Richard Samboro.
   ``We received a call on Friday night from the band's manager that
the band Bon Jovi and Cher wanted to rent out the theater at 12:30
that night,'' O'Neil said. ``I thought they were out of their minds,
but they were serious.''
   Bon Jovi arrived Thursday in Manchester for a Saturday night
concert.
   ``All they wanted to do was come in someplace where they could
relax,'' Jean Corder, a theater worker said. ``They were
well-mannered, and it was like seeing some local kids. I kept

<TEXT>
   The anti-government opposition papers
crammed atop a tiny downtown cafe table symbolize a world of change
for a resistance movement trying to oust the communists from power.
   With President Bush in town today, nine opposition groups have
set up shop in the corner of the Spartacus Cafe.
   In contrast to other Soviet bloc nations, Hungary has been
relatively tolerant of dissidents. But such an open and public
display of resistance, such as the one in the cafe, would have been
unthinkable in Hungary just a few years ago.
   ``A year ago, we could have imagined being taken into custody,''
says Tibor Vidos, a labor union spokesman.
   Vidos says the nine opposition groups represent between 80,000
and 100,000 people mapping strategy for free elections planned for
next year.
   ``I hope the Bush visit will strengthen democratic rights,'' the
35-year-old Vidos says. ``It will show those in power the world is
watching what's happening in Hungary.''
   Vidos is the spokesman for the Democratic Trade Union of
Scientific Workers, which bills itself as ``the first free union to
be formed in Hungary.''
   He and representatives of the other political opposition groups
are openly chatting with foreign journalists in the Spartacus Cafe,
named for a Roman gladiator who led a dramatic slaves' revolt in 72
B.C. The cafe is located two blocks from the U.S. Embassy.
   On the sultry eve of Bush's arrival, the late Roy Orbison's
classic song, ``Pretty Woman,'' is blaring from the cafe's souped-up
sound system. Soft drink bottles perch precariously on the cafe
table jammed with opposition literature espousing the heady goals of
breaking the last of the Communist Party grip on the country.
   ``We have no doubt that the vast majority of people have had
enough of this regime,'' says Geza Jeszenszky of the Hungarian
Democratic Forum.
   Jeszenszky, 47, describing his group as a patriotic movement
aimed at reaching out to the poor and those in rural areas, says
such an information center would not have been possible a year ago.
   ``On the surface, they (the Communists) really have changed their
spots,'' the Hungarian Democratic Forum spokesman says, adding he
hopes the changed attitudes also go much deeper.
   Aiding the opposition force is the reform mood within the
Communist Party itself, as well as the occasional divisions that
also are weakening the once iron-solid party grip on Hungary.
   The blunt tone of the material handed out at the Opposition
Information Center pushes freedom of expression to new limits in
Hungary.
   ``HDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) aims at relieving people from
the remnants of Stalinist tyranny, and letting the rebirth of the
nation happen without disaster,'' says the forum's English-language
pamphlet.
   The Federation of Young Democrats' pamphlet, also in English,
condemns ``dictatorial, totalitarian regimes, which are also hotbeds
of national oppression.''
   Federation spokesman Miklos Sukosd says opposition leaders are
counting on the proximity to the U.S. Embassy for ``symbolic
support.''
   Sukosd, 28, who said he was a graduate student in sociology at
Harvard University, says the opposition groups would like to delay
the elections by a few months to give them more time to campaign.
   ``The Communist Party popularity is falling very fast,'' said
Sukosd, who like the other opposition representatives spoke to The
Associated Press at the Spartacus Cafe.

<TEXT>
   Picture this hidden camera shot: ``Totally
Hidden Video'' made an unusually strong debut in the A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings for a Fox Broadcasting show.
   The twist: Fox had to make last-minute substitutions when it was
learned three segments used actors instead of unsuspecting people
caught by hidden cameras, and Allen Funt said in a lawsuit the show
was using some stunts from his ``Candid Camera.''
   And a producer was fired.
   ``Totally Hidden Video'' tied for 21st place in last week's
Nielsen ratings. Fox's ``Married...With Children,'' usually its
highest-ranked show, increased its showing for a tie for 29th place.
   NBC, led by ``Cheers,'' dominated the top 10 and won the week for
its 55th consecutive victory.
   Fox substituted part of Sunday's premiere show because actors
were used in three segments that were supposed to show the reactions
of people caught unaware by a hidden camera. Funt has sued Quantum
Media Inc., alleging the show uses stunts from his 43 years of
``Candid Camera.''
   The studio denies the allegations, but said it fired a producer
it did not identify.
   ``The producer failed to follow the show's guidelines requiring
that all targeted individuals were to be totally unaware a camera
was present and have no prior knowledge of the setups,'' Quantum
Media said in a statement.
   ``Totally Hidden Video'' got a 10.5 rating and ``Married...With
Children'' got 10.0. ``Married...With Children'' has been in the
mid-40s in the rankings and had ratings of 8.6 or lower.
   NBC won the week with an average prime-time rating of 10.1. ABC
had 8.8 and CBS 8.4.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 15.1 to ABC's 12.1 and
CBS' 12.0. Each rating point measures the percentage of the
estimated 90.4 million U.S. homes with televisions.
   Here is the top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``Dear John,'' ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' ABC's ``20-20,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls,'' and a tie between ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and ``Night
Court.''
   The NBC summer series, ``Knight and Daye,'' made its debut in
16th place.
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' tied with ``Cheers'' for first last week,
fell to 13th place because of competition from Fourth of July
fireworks.
   CBS had the top-rated evening news show with a rating of 8.5.
ABC, tied for first with CBS last week, was second with 8.1. NBC had
7.9.

<HEAD>US Wheat Farmers Would Come Out on Top Without Price Supports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If all countries removed farm subsidies and
opted for free trade, the American wheat farmer would eventually
come out on top, according to Agriculture Department researchers.
   But there are some catches. It also would depend on production
costs and relative prices domestically and overseas. And some wheat
farmers could go broke, meaning the survivors would be fewer and
larger.
   If U.S. acreage programs were phased out, including the
long-range Conservation Reserve Program, wheat production ``would
rise somewhat'' in the short run, a report by the department's
Economic Research Service said.
   ``But if a large portion of cropland re-entered production,
average U.S. wheat yields would fall because the land currently
idled is less productive,'' the report said.
   If government support to agriculture is completely removed, U.S.
farm prices and incomes ``may fall somewhat and become more
variable'' in the short run.
   ``This likely would cause land prices to fall,'' the report said.
``But a rise in export demand over the long run _ or government
assistance not tied to production _ may offset land value declines
and result in more stable incomes.''
   The report, published in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, is the first of a series by the agency about efforts to
liberalize world agricultural trade. The first analysis deals only
with wheat.
   An editor's note said that while theorists claim that free trade
benefits society, there are adjustment costs, and gainers and
losers. And because ``there never has been free trade in
agriculture,'' the findings are speculative, it said.
   ``Several studies indicate that world prices could rise
considerably in the long run, and that the distribution of
production and consumption across countries would change
significantly,''the report said. ``However, total world trade in
wheat is unlikely to change substantially, researchers generally
agree.''
   An overhaul of global trade and farm policies is being discussed
by the United States and other countries under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. One of the U.S. goals in the so-called Uruguay
Round of talks is long-range reform including the gradual
elimination of all ``trade-distorting'' subsidies and other programs.
   Negotiators in April agreed on a framework for both long- and
short-term reforms. The short-term measures include freezing support
and production levels, followed by unspecified reduction in 1990.
Long-term measures call for ``substantial progressive reductions''
in farm supports, including all measures directly or indirectly
related to trade access, internal supports and export competition.
   The United States ``probably has a long-term comparative
advantage in wheat production because of its climate, soil fertility
and well-developed production and distribution system,'' the report
said. ``Trade reform likely would enhance the long-term U.S.
position, since the most efficient producers would gain the most
from substantial trade reform.''
   But agency analysts said not all U.S. wheat farmers would benefit
from trade liberalization if all government supports were removed.
Even so, producers would have several choices.
   ``Farmers could find that using wheat land for cattle grazing or
other farming operations would earn an acceptable return,'' the
report said. ``They could subsidize wheat production with other
income, hoping that their wheat production would become more
profitable over time; or they could leave farming.''
   In the absence of federal income supports, farmers with heavy
debt loads would be in trouble.
   ``The U.S. wheat sector likely would become increasingly
concentrated,'' the report said. ``Over time, the costs of
production may fall as farmers spread the fixed costs of machinery
and equipment over a larger number of acres, while using management
and labor more efficiently.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North, who is appealing his conviction
in the Iran-Contra scandal, won't have to pay his $150,000 fine
until the appeal is decided.
   However, North said Tuesday he does not want to put off the two
years of probation and 1,200 hours of community service that U.S.
District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell imposed instead of a prison
term at North's sentencing last week.
   North said in a one-sentence notice that he is taking his
conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals and requested a
stay in his fine. Gesell granted the delay in the fine until the
case is resolved.
   In a separate filing, North's lawyers said he ``does not seek a
stay of the sentence of probation conditioned on community service.
He would like to begin promptly the important community service
program ordered by the court.''
   They said the next six to 12 months are ``a critical `start up'
period during which the program could best use the assistance'' of
North. He was ordered to help administer a new program to help
District of Columbia youths living in public housing avoid getting
involved with drugs.
   ``We submit that a stay of payment of the fines would be
appropriate in light of the significant issues that Lt. Col. North
intends to raise on appeal,'' his lawyers concluded.
   Prosecutors said they won't oppose a delay of the fine during the
appeal.
   Gesell, who could have sentenced North to 10 years in prison and
$750,000 in fines, decided not to order any prison time for the
former National Security Council aide. The judge said time behind
bars would only ``harden your misconceptions'' about public service
and increase North's feelings of martyrdom.
   North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, altering and destroying classified National Security
Council documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. He was
acquitted on nine other charges.

<HEAD>Regulators Say Nuclear Dump Site Planning is Flawed</HEAD>

   Federal officials may not be paying enough
attention to the risk of geologic faults and volcanic activity near
a proposed Nevada site for a high-level nuclear waste dump, a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission member says.
   The NRC also said Tuesday the Energy Department's formula for
evaluating the desert site is flawed in at least two important ways.
   Kenneth Rogers, a member of the commission, questioned whether
the department was giving enough attention to ``killer issues'' that
could disqualify the site, such as whether geologic faults or
volcanic activity in the area could destabilize the underground
repository.
   ``I wonder whether that's getting as much attention as it
should,'' Rogers said.
   The commission on Tuesday published key parts of its review of
the Energy Department plan for assessing whether Yucca Mountain,
about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, could safely store tons of
radioactive nuclear waste for 10,000 years.
   The final NRC assessment is to be published July 28.
   The Nevada state government is strongly opposed to the waste dump
for safety and public health reasons. Gov. Bob Miller recently
signed a bill passed by the legislature prohibiting storage of
high-level radioactive waste in Nevada.
   Technical experts who conducted the NRC review told the
commission the Energy Department has made many improvements in its
plan since last year, but that it has not yet resolved at least two
significant issues.
   The objections are that the department's plan does not include an
adequate means of assuring the quality of the technical data
collected, and that the design of an experimental shaft to be
drilled on the site may be flawed, said Robert Bernero, director of
the NRC's office of nuclear materials safety and safeguards.
   Bernero said the department could go ahead with its site
assessment without NRC approval of the plan, but it could face the
same objections later when it sought licenses from the commission to
operate the dump, he said.
   Initial construction work is scheduled for November, and the
Energy Department is to decide by 1994 whether the site is suitable.
It would then have to apply to the NRC for an operating license.
Under the present timetable, nuclear waste would start moving into
the site in 2003.
   Dade Moeller, chairman of an NRC advisory committee that also has
reviewed the Energy Department plan, said department officials told
him they believed any problems that could disqualify the site would
``just pop out'' during the site evaluation.
   Bernero also said the NRC is concerned that the project timetable
is putting the Energy Department under too much deadline pressure.
   Bernero also disclosed that Samuel Rousso, the head of the
department's waste management program, complained in a June 28
letter that the NRC was nitpicking on the Yucca Mountain project and
causing unnecessary delays.
   ``We are frequently devoting time to repeatedly addressing
matters that could be more productively evaluated'' by beginning the
on-site evaluation work, Rousso's letter said. A copy of the letter
was made available by the NRC.
   In a related development, the Energy Department's field office in
Las Vegas said it ordered Sandia National Laboratories, a major
contractor on the Yucca Mountain project, to stop work Monday until
it corrects a technical flaw in its quality-control program.
   Derek Scammell, a department spokesman in Las Vegas, said Sandia
is expected to fix the problem by Aug. 4 and that the work stoppage
will not affect the overall schedule for completing the assessment
of the mountain site.

   Women in the Third World need special health
care that goes far beyond the childbearing needs that medical
providers pay attention to, according to an international study.
   The women's problems, stemming from the large amount of work they
perform, are made worse by the lack of professional health care,
according to the report, ``Strengthening Women: Health Research
Priorities for Women in Developing Countries.''
   The study said medical attention for women in the Third World is
focused almost entirely on childbearing.
   A.W. Patterson, director of the Caribbean Food and Nutrition
Institute in Jamaica, said that in the Third World one of every four
deaths of young women _ in some countries one out of every two _ is
related to pregnancy and childbirth.
   But ``we don't need the infant-health rationale for attention to
be focused on women's health,'' said Allan Rosenfield, dean of the
School of Public Health at Columbia University.
   The women suffer malnutrition, diabetes, high blood pressure and
other physical problems far more frequently than women in developed
nations, the report released Tuesday said.
   ``Women's ... responsibilities in developing countries include
obtaining water, producing and preparing food and gathering
firewood, all without benefit of modern appliances,'' the report
said.
   ``Women farmers grow at least 50 percent of the world's food ...
Women's low earnings, poverty and often sole responsibility for
maintaining households add to the burdens of their dual home and
market roles because women must work longer hours to earn even a
minimally acceptable level of income.''
   Heavy work can lead to special leg and back problems. The Third
World women are exposed to water-borne diseases because they are
generally responsible for getting water from communal sources.
   Women in the Third World also suffer from malnutrition due to
lack of proteins and from anemia and other diseases caused by a lack
of iron, the report said. Older women have more diabetes and
possibly more high blood pressure than their counterparts in
wealthier nations.
   The study pointed out that many women in Third World countries do
not know how to get medical attention and often lack the time, money
and transportation to get it.
   It called for more research that distinguishes results by gender,
by geographical region and which takes social and cultural facts
into consideration.
   The report was prepared by researchers from the United States,
India, Jamaica, Zaire and Chile.

   A study on exposure to Agent Orange, the toxic
defoliant used in Vietnam, may have been designed by the government
to fail, a congressman charges.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., also said Tuesday the decision two years
ago to cancel the massive study by the Centers for Disease Control
has wrongfully put the lid on other government research.
   ``The federal government has effectively used the CDC study to
stifle any attempts to link Agent Orange to health effects,'' Weiss
said at a hearing of his Government Operations subcommittee on human
resources and intergovernmental relations. ``CDC has had the last
word on Agent Orange.''
   ``Either it was a politically rigged operation or it was a
monumentally bungled operation,'' Weiss said.
   Dr. Vernon N. Houk of the CDC said the study was abandoned
because the CDC couldn't find the right data to develop a valid
method to study the health effects of the defoliant.
   But several other scientists, including former CDC researcher Dr.
Dennis M. Smith, testified that the needed data, including detailed
troop movement, were available from the Defense Department's
Environmental Study Group.
   Houk, chairman of a scientific panel of the White House Agent
Orange Working Group, denied suggestions by Weiss that the White
House called the shots on the study.
   ``The science panel was not considered and is not considered and
has never functioned as a political entity,'' he said.
   Weiss said CDC conducted another study finding a low sperm count
and malformed sperm among Vietnam veterans. As a result of the
earlier study, CDC dismissed any link between those findings and
Agent Orange because ``we found that few Army ground troops were
heavily exposed to dioxin-containing herbicides,'' Weiss said,
quoting the report.
   Many Vietnam veterans have said they have developed cancer and
that their children have a high incidence of birth defects because
of Agent Orange, which was used to clear dense jungle during the war.
   There are 34,000 veterans seeking government benefits as a result
of disabilities they say were caused by Agent Orange. The active
ingredient of Agent Orange is dioxin, a cancer-causing chemical.
   The Veterans Affairs Department, formerly the Veterans
Administration, said in May it would take another look at those
cases.
   Veterans exposed to Agent Orange also have sued the seven
chemical companies that made the herbicide. The suit was settled,
and an Agent Orange fund was created to pay $180 million in damages.
Caretakers for the fund say $12 million has been distributed to
6,039 veterans and 13 organizations so far.

<HEAD>Shadowy Figure Takes Witness Stand at Impeachment Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators gathering evidence against Judge Alcee
L. Hastings are weighing testimony from a shadowy figure with
underworld ties who answered questions behind closed doors and then
vanished out a rear exit.
   ``He is an elusive figure who can only be located through the
FBI,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, told reporters after informant
William Dredge finished testifying at the Hastings impeachment trial.
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida history, is
accused of conspiracy to obtain a $150,000 bribe, lying about it to
a jury that acquitted him in 1983 and improper disclosure of wiretap
information.
   Impeached by the House a year ago, Hastings is now on trial in
the Senate. If convicted he would be removed from the bench and
deprived of his $89,500 annual judicial salary.
   Testimony from Dredge at a panel hearing evidence on the case
came as Hastings lost a battle Tuesday to get a Supreme Court order
halting the proceedings.
   Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied the request to
halt the proceedings while the U.S. Court of Appeals makes a
decision on Hastings' claims that the impeachment trial is
unconstitutional.
   Bryant and other House members are serving as prosecutors as the
Senate panel collects evidence, which will be presented to the full
Senate before it votes on Hastings ouster.
   Police guarded hearing room doors and a television cameras were
ordered off as Dredge was brought in to testify. Bryant said he
feared for his life because he had been a witness for the government
in a trial involving top organized crime hoodlums.
   Bryant, who is acting as chief prosecutor in the Hastings case,
acknowledged Dredge was less than an ideal witness.
   ``Everyone involved in this knew that Dredge had a lengthy
criminal record spanning his entire adult life,'' Bryant said
afterward. He said efforts to remove Hastings from the bench do not
hinge on the Dredge's credibility and that the key points are
corroborated by other witnesses.
   Hastings attorney Terence Anderson discounted the testimony,
saying he had zeroed in on Dredge's background.
   ``On cross examination, I think I showed up the slippery little
worm,'' Anderson boasted after Dredge had been escorted out a rear
exit.
   Bryant said Dredge's testimony was intended to show the senators
there was nothing unusual in building the Hastings case.
   Prosecutors say Dredge was sent by Washington attorney William
Borders to solicit a $150,000 bribe in exchange for Hastings'
keeping two brothers, Frank and Thomas Romano, out of prison.
   The Romano brothers, both now dead, had been sentenced by
Hastings to three years each following a racketeering conviction
involving a loan from a Teamsters Union pension fund.
   Dredge, facing trial on charges of plotting to distribute
quaalude tablets, became an informant against Borders, who
eventually went to prison.
   Dredge retold the story in detail in his five hours before the
committee, attorneys and lawmakers said.
   During a lunchtime break, Hastings told reporters outside the
hearing room that Dredge was ``an incredible liar.''
   ``Quite frankly, I don't like him,'' Hastings said. ``Never did,
never will.'' He said Dredge's testimony ``has been carefully
rehearsed and gone over repeatedly.''
   Meanwhile, House members were blocked from asking Miami criminal
lawyer Neal Sonnett about a telephone conversation between the
Romano brothers and an associate, Phillip Moscato, in which they
allegedly discussed whether someone could intervene in the Romanos'
legal troubles.
   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said
Sonnett's testimony would be hearsay.

<HEAD>Hecht Confirmed as Ambassador to Bahamas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Chic Hecht is headed to the
Bahamas, winning confirmation as U.S. ambassador despite complaints
from some of his former colleagues that he's unfit to serve as point
man in the war on drugs.
   The Senate voted 78-19 on Tuesday to confirm the Nevada
Republican and keep alive the tradition that the Senate rarely
rejects a former member seeking confirmation to an executive branch
post.
   The vote came after Hecht's defenders declared he was fully
qualified by his experience in business, banking and government to
handle an ambassadorship.
   But Hecht's detractors pointed to his remarks that he was looking
forward to his appointment because the Bahamas offered gambling
casinos, good golf and fishing.
   ``An appointment of an ambassador is not a vacation trip,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who led the fight against the
nomination, said that while Hecht might serve with distinction in
other posts, he is not qualified to serve as ``a key operational
officer in the war against drugs.''
   ``He does not deserve, nor does our nation deserve to be
represented by him in the Bahamas,'' Graham said.
   Graham said the Bahamas has risen to a high state of importance
in the drug war because of its history as a shipping point for
cocaine and other narcotics and because its banks have been used to
launder illicit drug profits.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said Hecht is representative of the
high percentage of Republican stalwarts and fundraisers being named
by President Bush to diplomatic posts.
   The chief qualification of most of them is loyalty to Bush, said
Sarbanes, who called them ``political throwaways.''
   Graham and other senators said the Bahamas had become too
important in the war against drugs to entrust the post to anyone who
is less than a fully competent and professional ambassador.
   Hecht, 60, whose one term in the Senate was marked by such
malapropisms as his vow not to permit a ``nuclear suppository'' to
be located in his state, had told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee he would feel at home in the Bahamas because of its
similarities to Las Vegas.
   ``I've been involved in gambling in Nevada, and I've been
involved in banking for 25 years,'' Hecht said. ``Also, I understand
it is a nice lifestyle. I love golf and they have a lot of nice golf
courses and good fishing.''
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Hecht made those comments in jest.
   Another defender, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Hecht was trying
to say that both the Bahamas and Las Vegas have multimillion-dollar
tourist industries of great importance to their economies.
   ``It is not something to be twisted and misrepresented and
hee-hawed by journalistic pygmies in the news media,'' Helms said,
contending that Hecht has been attacked only because of his record
as a conservative.
   ``Chic is a remarkable man,'' Helms said. ``He is probably the
brightest man to serve in the Senate.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Looking For Ways to Cut Medicate Surtax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A projected surplus in the catastrophic health
plan's trust fund may not be there after all, threatening hopes that
a controversial surtax that would help finance the Medicare
expansion could be cut without touching benefits.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas said Tuesday he was told by
Congressional Budget Office analysts that a catastrophic trust fund
surplus once estimated at $2 billion to $4 billion apparently will
not be realized.
   Bentsen, the major Senate architect of the program that started
taking effect last January, said last month he planned to propose a
substantial cut in the surtax _ or so-called supplemental premium _
imposed on elderly Americans in upper income brackets.
   But that intention was based on projections that more money was
coming in from the surtax than originally calculated and that the
tax could be cut without trimming benefits.
   ``I'm having trouble finding numbers I can count on,'' Bentsen,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said during a hearing on
ways to revise the program.
   If there is no surplus, benefits would have to be cut if the
surtax is cut, said Bentsen. ``We have to take a serious look at
benefits, and prescription drugs is one of those we will look at,''
he said.
   The provision to have Medicare payments for prescription drugs
would be phased in over three years and would be partly paid for by
the surtax.
   When the catastrophic program was passed last summer _ the first
major expansion of Medicare in its two-decade history _ the idea was
to build up funds in advance for the new benefits so the program
would operate on a pay-as-you-go basis.
   The surtax this year is 15 percent of underlying tax liability
and can range up to $800 for roughly 5 percent of the 33 million
people eligible for Medicare.
   However, about 60 percent of those eligible for Medicare would
not be subject to the surtax because of their low incomes.
   Congress has been hit with thousands of letters from elderly
people complaining they are being forced to pay for additional
coverage they could better afford to buy on their own.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a member of the
Finance Committee, praised Bentsen's intention to push for changes
in the program.
   ``Some of us would like to hang on to this program, but make
whatever changes are necessary,'' Dole said.
   The program, he said, does contain some inequities _ mainly by
overlapping coverage that some of the 33 million eligible people
already had.
   Because of the complicated interlocking nature of Medicare and
other public and private health plans covering older Americans,
witnesses told the panel there is wide misunderstanding of the
extent of duplicative coverage.
   David Newhall III, acting assistant defense secretary for health
affairs, testified that although about 720,000 military retirees and
dependents are eligible for treatment in military facilities and
consider themselves covered by the military program, more than half
receive care in private facilities where the bills are picked up by
Medicare.
   ``We could never come close to handling the total benefit needs
of this population,'' Newhall said.

<TEXT>
   A biologist charged with plagiarism in an
investigation by the National Institutes of Health is prepared to
appeal a ruling that took away his right to do government-financed
research.
   C. David Bridges, now on the faculty of Purdue University, said
Tuesday he was ``completely innocent'' of NIH charges that he took
information from unpublished research by a group of Harvard
scientists and published it under his own name.
   A report by an NIH committee recommended Bridges be barred from
conducting federally-sponsored research and from serving on peer
review committees.
   In addition, a spokesman at Purdue said Bridges will be
investigated by a faculty committee there, although Bridges was a
researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston at the time of
the questioned publication.
   The journal Science, which published Bridges' paper in 1987, is
printing a ``Notification to Readers'' on Friday reporting on the
findings of the NIH investigation.
   In a statement to the Lafayette, Ind., Courier-Journal, Bridges
said, ``I'm completely innocent of these charges. I do want to make
it quite clear that I did not do this.''
   He blamed the NIH report on political pressure, saying: ``We live
in an ethical era and the NIH is under the political gun at this
point in time.''
   A report on the NIH investigation, obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request,
charges Bridges made unauthorized and uncredited use of information
from a Harvard University manuscript that had been sent to him for
peer review.
   The report recommends Bridges be blocked from receiving federal
grants and excluded from peer review programs for 10 years.
   Bridges' attorney, George Bishop of Houston, denied the charges
and said the researcher will appeal the NIH action to the Department
of Health and Human Services. Bridges also plans to fight to
maintain his position at Purdue.
   A Purdue spokesman, Joseph Bennett, said a committee of faculty
members has been named to investigate the controversy.
   ``Purdue is preceding with the assumption that Dr. Bridges is
entitled to full due process and that Purdue wants to get its
information first-hand,'' Bennett said.
   Though Bridges is a tenured professor at Purdue and the incident
under investigation happened while he was at Baylor, Bennett said
Purdue could take disciplinary action against Bridges.
   The NIH report said Bridges committed a form of plagiarism when
he used Harvard experiment data, which he saw in the manuscript, to
conduct his own experiments and then published an article in the
journal Science without acknowledging the Harvard source.
   ``Plagiarism _ the unauthorized use of another person's
experimental protocol, in this case _ is a serious misconduct of
science in that it undermines the entire peer-review process upon
which the scientific enterprise is dependent,'' the NIH
investigation report said.
   An NIH committee that reviewed the investigation said it was
``clearly dismayed'' by Bridges' behavior, and said using
information obtained from unpublished manuscripts sent for peer
review ``is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated by scientists or
the public.''
   The report also recommended that all current NIH grants to
Bridges be terminated and that the journal Science be notified of
the investigation report.
   Carol Rogers, a spokeswoman for the American Association for
Advancement of Science, publisher of Science, said the association
also will ask science libraries to cross-reference the notification
in computer files of scientific research.
   Bishop, the Houston attorney representing Bridges, said the NIH
ruling was unfair because Bridges was never given a chance to
confront his accusers or to know precisely the charges.
   ``The charges were reviewed in secret,'' said Bishop. ``We think
if the facts are heard, Bridges will be vindicated.''
   Bishop said the NIH action keeps Bridges from making a living and
could threaten his position at Purdue.
   ``Those grants are important to keep his livelihood going,'' said
Bishop, and loss of the grants ``probably will have some effect'' on
Bridges' job at Purdue.
   The lawyer said an NIH grant given to Bridges already has been
canceled and that two of his research assistants have been laid off.
   According to the NIH report, Bridges was a professor in the
department of ophthalmology at Baylor doing research on the
biochemistry of vision when he was sent a Harvard University
manuscript to review for a National Academy of Sciences publication
in the summer of 1986.
   The NIH investigation said Bridges declined to review the
manuscript and returned it to the academy.
   The Harvard research identified and described an enzyme called
isomerase which plays a role in vision.

<HEAD>FDA Commissioner `Shocked' at Bribes Tied to Drug Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration says he doesn't know whether the government can
withdraw market approval for products from generic drug companies
that bribed FDA scientists.
   Commissioner Frank E. Young vowed to seek penalties against the
firms, but told a congressional panel Tuesday ``we're having a
difficult time trying to determine what we can do to remove these
particular products'' from the market.
   Young told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations he is ``shocked, embarrassed and
angered'' by revelations that FDA scientists accepted bribes from
the firms.
   Subcommittee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., said the scandal
means ``We can no longer be reasonably confident that the FDA is
able to detect the entry of unsafe or inefficacious generic drugs in
the nation's pharmacies.''
   Young countered that a special review of the products made by
companies implicated so far ``have uncovered no safety concerns,''
but he conceded ``we cannot be fully confident on the issue of
product safety'' until more tests are done.
   He also outlined new administrative procedures, including a
shakeup of the generic drug division and prohibitions against idle
contacts between FDA officials and manufacturers, to head off
repetition of the case.
   The subcommittee has been conducting its own investigation while
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Baltimore continues to pursue a
criminal probe in which two FDA scientists, Charles Y. Chang and
David J. Brancato, have pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from drug
companies and a third has been charged with doing so.
   According to criminal informations filed in the case, American
Therapeutics, Inc., Par Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Basics,
Inc., are among companies which sought favored treatment from the
FDA in their bids to market generic drugs.
   Another firm, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Springfield
Gardens, N.Y., is under investigation for allegedly substituting
samples of an original product, Dyazide, a high-blood-pressure drug,
in its bid to win approval of its generic copycat. Dyazide is made
by the SmithKline Beckman Corp., and is one of the most widely
prescribed drugs in the country.
   ``We are actively investigating all aspects of this case, which
we regard _ should the facts be confirmed _ as wholly unconscionable
and intolerable. In addition, we are making every effort to
determine whether any other firms may have engaged in this
practice,'' Young said.
   Top executives of Vitarine have denied knowledge of the alleged
substitution, and have suspended at least three employees involved
with the submission. It has voluntarily recalled the drug, as well
as several others, pending the results of the FDA review.
   Dingell complained ``the FDA has yet to move against the
companies corrupting the FDA's process. Both Par Pharmaceuticals and
American Therapeutics, Inc., the two biggest providers of illegal
gratuities to FDA employees named in criminal informations to date,
have each received ... new generic drug approvals.''
   Carl Peck, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation,
confirmed he recently approved generic products submitted by both
firms, but said they involved drugs in which ``none of the
implicated reviewers had a part,'' and for which applications had
been pending for 1{ years.
   Dingell said that response shows ``frivolity prevails at the
FDA.''

<TEXT>
   Workers in Western Europe have bargained their way
to the longest annual paid vacations, while Americans have the
shortest vacations and the Japanese have to be persuaded to take
time off, an International Labor Organization report says.
   The study published Tuesday says legislation and collective
bargaining have lengthened vacations in Europe, but there is little
movement in this direction in the United States.
   In West Germany, nearly two-thirds of the workforce get six weeks
paid leave each year under deals struck by employers and unions,
even though the legal entitlement is only three weeks. Ten years
ago, nobody in the country had six weeks paid holiday.
   In France, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg, collective bargaining
often boosts the statutory five-week leave by another week, the
report says.
   In legal terms, Spain has made the most progress, increasing paid
leave from one to five weeks over the last 25 years.
   Italian workers are frequently given six weeks annual leave,
while most British employees enjoy at least four weeks paid
vacation, even though neither country has laws on holiday rights.
   However, collective bargaining in the United States has not had
the same results. There are no laws on holiday entitlement and time
off depends on the length of service with an employer, the report
notes.
   It cites a U.S. government survey showing that, on average,
employees who had worked for a company for one year got less than
nine days paid holiday. This rose to nearly 23 days after 30 years
with the same company.
   ``But not many people in the United States stay in the same place
for 30 years,'' said Joseph Thurman, an expert on working hours at
the ILO.
   He said cultural differences and lack of pressure to increase
holiday time are among the reasons for the United States lagging
behind Western European countries.
   ``If you told an American that a West German got six weeks
holiday, he would be astounded. Similarly, a West German would be
amazed that anyone could make do with two weeks paid leave a year,''
Thurman said in an interview.
   Although Japan cut working hours last year, he said, the Japanese
are proving reluctant to take advantage of their increased leisure
time.
   Thurman said most Japanese workers take only half their yearly
allowance of 10 days leave. But the 17 to 18 days of public holidays
in Japan compare favorably with eight days in Britain and
Switzerland, he added.
   Thurman noted that Japan's Ministry of Labor had set up a special
Leisure Development Center to persuade people to take their full
holiday entitlement.

   A Bush administration draft of clean air
legislation substantially backs off from his promise to
``dramatically accelerate'' pollution reduction by the year 2000,
say a House panel chairman and an environmental spokesman.
   ``We've got to hope people in the Environmental Protection Agency
can turn this around,'' Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee, said Tuesday after
seeing the draft language.
   The Office of Management and Budget draft, also obtained by The
Associated Press, was dated June 30 and warned at the top of each
page, ``all provisions subject to change. Do not distribute, quote
or cite.''
   A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency denied
Tuesday night that the president's proposals had been significantly
weakened.
   Bush and congressional leaders have placed a new clean air bill
near the top of their legislative agenda for the remainder of this
year.
   Bush outlined his proposal June 12 but has not yet sent Congress
the legislation to implement his plan. A White House fact sheet
distributed after the announcement promised the plan ``will
dramatically accelerate the pace of pollution reduction and put
America on the path toward markedly cleaner air by the end of the
century.''
   The legislation is expected to be sent to Congress in about two
weeks.
   ``I'm very disappointed to hear the direction the administration
seems to be taking,'' said Waxman, a California Democrat.
   Among the provisions criticized by Waxman and others is a
proposed switch in auto emissions standards from an emissions
ceiling that each car must meet to a fleet-wide average, a change
long advocated by the auto industry.
   The draft would give the EPA administrator authority ``to
demonstrate compliance with ... emissions standards through intra-or
inter-manufacturer averaging of emissions of vehicle or engine
families.''
   Last month Bush said he would propose reducing the exhaust
standard for unburned fuel from 0.41 grams per mile to 0.25 grams
per mile, the limit currently in effect for California.
   But to account for manufacturing variations, automakers already
must build cars that average somewhat below 0.41 grams, so it is not
clear what an average of 0.25 grams would mean. Waxman said the
proposal could mean no reduction in actual emissions.
   Richard Ayres, staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council and chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, the major
lobbying organization of environmental groups on clean air
questions, said the auto fleet average provisions would be a major
retreat from current law.
   The president said he wanted to require industrial emitters of
toxic air pollutants to use the ``best available'' technology to
control pollution.
   The bill draft, however, would permit EPA to take into account
not only the risks to public health, but also ``the cost and
technical feasibility'' for industry in ordering reductions of
toxics.
   ``They're talking about the cost-benefit system rather than
setting a health standard. There is the potential to say it's not
worth the cost'' of emission reductions, Waxman said. ``No one
figures the economic cost of cancer and other health care costs.''
   Christian Rice, spokesman for EPA, said, ``There isn't any loss
for Bush's proposals.''
   Top EPA officials ``are saying we've won major victories in the
inter-agency process,'' Rice said. He said consideration of cost in
controlling toxic air pollution was envisioned all along in the
president's plan.
   The switch to an average auto emissions standard would still mean
``you'd get some reduction in emissions,'' he said.

   Two commercial helicopters collided off
Galveston Island and crashed in shallow waters Tuesday, and each
aircraft's pilot was presumed dead, the Coast Guard said.
   In Alabama, a military helicopter crashed and burned, injuring
two crewmen, the Army said.
   The Coast Guard called off its search late Tuesday after human
remains were found two miles south of Galveston Island, officials
said.
   Searchers also found floating wreckage and debris on the beach
along the island's west side, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Ron
Chadwick.
   The crash occurred around 4:30 p.m. in waters about 25 feet deep,
officials said. There were no witnesses.
   The Galveston airport reported losing radio communications with
the helicopters, which were apparently used to ferry crews to
offshore drilling sites, said Coast Guard Lt. Scott LaRochelle.
   The names of the two pilots, who were alone in their aircraft,
were being withheld pending notification of relatives, said Chadwick.
   A Coast Guard helicopter and patrol boat took part in the search,
said LaRochelle.
   One of the helicopters, a Bell 206-L1, was owned by Air Logistics
Inc. of New Iberia La. The other was identified as an Aerospatiale
AS-350 owned by Petroleum Helicopters Inc. of Lafayette, La.,
company officials said.
   In southeastern Alabama, a UH-1H Huey helicopter from Fort Rucker
crashed Tuesday morning as it attempted to land at staging field
near Louisville after becoming sluggish, said Army Master Sgt. David
Malone.
   The two crewmen were in fair condition with back injuries at
Lyster U.S. Army Community Hospital, said Fort Rucker spokesman Jim
Kelley.
   The aircraft made an unusual sound before crashing, Malone said.
He said it was unclear whether the $250,000 aircraft caught fire
before hitting the ground or after.

<TEXT>
   A conservationist climbed 71 feet up a white
pine tree and placed an identification band on an eaglet while the
new father swooped overhead.
   To Peter Nye, who has banded several hundred eagles, Tuesday's
job proved mostly routine. But it was an exciting moment for New
Hampshire environmentalists in their long attempt to bring
endangered bald eagles back to the state.
   On April 14, they celebrated the discovery of an egg. The chick
hatched about five weeks later, but on June 13 it was determined the
eaglet had died.
   That's when the plan was hatched to bring in a foster chick, born
in captivity at a Syracuse, N.Y., zoo, to see if the grieving
parents would accept a substitute.
   Three days later, the 27-day-old chick was put in the nest on the
Magalloway River near Umbagog Lake on the Maine border. By day's
end, the parents had accepted the chick.
   That's when the call went out to Nye, head of New York's
Department of Environmental Conservation's Endangered Species Unit.
   With biologists and others looking on anxiously from a nearby
island, Nye went about his task. He called it unusual for the male
to swoop overhead that close, but he was unperturbed.
   ``I didn't pay much attention to him,'' he said, ``I felt pretty
safe because I had a lot of branches protecting me.''
   After photographing the chick, he took one leg of the eaglet,
which he said tried to hit him with its wings. ``Once I got a hold
of her, she was real quiet,'' he said.
   He placed a band on each leg to enable environmentalists to study
the eagle's movements. Coincidentally, five years ago Nye had banded
the father, who had migrated from New York, the farthest Nye knows
one of his birds has traveled to nest.
   The eagle ``is something we've really done a bad deed to,'' he
said, ``and it's good to be part of something to bring them back.''
   Chemical sprays, such as DDT, crept into the wildlife food chain
after World War II and helped make eagles an endangered species.
   Nye's program has helped restore them in New York. Maine has
about 100 pairs. Alaska has the most eagles. Some also can be found
in Florida, Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.
   ``We have no control over where they go,'' said Carol Foss of the
Audubon Society of New Hampshire. ``We do our best to protect them
when they come back. If all goes well, 10 or 15 years from now, we
might have 10 or 15 eagle pairs.''
   But for now, the next step is the first week in August when the
eaglet is expected to take flight for the first time. Then she will
be on her own.

   Take a lump of beef fat, spike it with a
dash of lithium chloride, top it off with a whiff of Pine Sol and
you've got a sickening recipe.
   So sickening that state biologists hope it will keep scavenging
bears away from Juneau's garbage cans.
   The state Department of Fish and Game is stuffing fat chunks with
lithium chloride or thiabendazole, which when digested cause
vomiting and diarrhea. The chunks are tied to strips of flannel
soaked in Pine Sol, a pine-scented cleaner, and placed along bear
trails in forests and in garbage cans on the edge of town.
   Biologists hope the bears will associate the odor of Pine Sol
with food that makes them retch. If the experiment works, deterring
bears from garbage dining could be as easy as spraying trash cans
with pine cleaner.
   ``The idea is to make these bears hate being around people. The
faster we can do that, the better,'' says state biologist Roger
Seavoy. He says the chemical deterrents are not permanently harmful
to the bears.
   It's too early to determine if the experiment is working, but
Seavoy says there are signs that bears sickened by the tainted
snacks are choosing to dine elsewhere.

   Beef lovers are in Luck.
   Or at least that's what the advertisements might say. This small
western Wisconsin community was chosen as the setting for a
television commercial to promote red meat, and the locals have no
beef with that.
   ``Nothing ever happens in little Luck,'' said Mary Peterson, an
employee in the clerk's office for the village of about 1,000
residents. ``This is real exciting.''
   Luck was one of four small communities selected by the Beef
Industry Foundation as part of a ``real food for real people''
advertising campaign. The ads will be a switch from the recent
campaign featuring celebrities such as actors James Garner and
Cybill Shepherd and basketball star Larry Bird.
   ``The whole idea of our campaign is that we want to use real
people in real cities that have interesting names,'' said Jeanne
Sowa, advertising vice president for the Beef Industry Council.
   The comercials will feature Manhattan, Mont., where people are
supposed to respect good taste; Utopia, Texas, where they are said
to feel good after eating beef; and Yale, Wash., where they
supposedly are sophisticated enough to appreciate nutrition.
   You might have guessed the script for the Luck ad. ``Where would
we be without beef?'' a narrator asks. ``Out of luck.''

   Club goers hoping to party 'til dawn can come
a little closer to their goal thanks to a court ruling giving
discotheque patrons an extra half-hour to imbibe after ``last call.''
   In a 6-1 decision Tuesday, the state Court of Appeals ruled that
New York City's Cabaret Law requiring such establishments to close
from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. conflicted with a state law allowing bar
patrons to continue to consume alcoholic beverages until 4:30 a.m.
   While the court noted the law also prohibits the sale of
alcoholic beverages between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m., it said the law
permits bars to stay open until 4:30 a.m. so patrons can finish
their drinks.
   The court ruled in a case brought by the owner of The Limelight,
a disco located in a former Manhattan church. Owner Peter Gatien got
upset over a $100 fine and pursued his case to the state's highest
court, said a lawyer for the popular nightspot.
   Stuart Byron, the chief lawyer for Gatien, said that by having a
simultaneous closing time and cutoff of drink sales, ``you almost
compel people to chug-a-lug.'' That could lead to more drunken
driving, he said.

<HEAD>Agents Raid Newspaper, Confiscate Evidence of Lawmaker's North Korean
Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intelligence agents charged into a
leading dissident newspaper today and confiscated pictures and
notepaper as evidence of a lawmaker's illegal trip to North Korea.
   About 40 intelligence agents and 100 plainclothes police wearing
helmets forced their way through the locked gates of the dissident
Hankyoreh newspaper as reporters shouting ``We refuse to be
searched!'' tried to block them.
   More than 1,000 riot troopers in combat fatigues circled the
newspaper compound. Police, apparently fearing a suicide attempt in
protest of their raid, laid out safety mattresses around the
building and a firetruck stood by.
   About 30 protesting reporters, many wearing headbands and
shouting slogans, were taken away by police and kept in a police van
until the 20-minute search was completed. They were released
afterwards.
   ``The surprise search at dawn of the newspaper's editorial room
is unprecedented and is never tolerable. We will continue our
struggle to win a free and independent press freedom in solidarity
with journalists at home and abroad,'' said Hankyoreh president and
publisher Song Kon-ho.
   The Agency for National Security Planning obtained a search
warrant on Monday demanding pictures and other material pertaining
to the illegal visit to communist North Korea by National
Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won.
   Reporters staged a two-day sit-in and the newspaper refused to
allow agents in the newsroom, claiming it was an infrigement on the
free press.
   Suh turned himself into authorities June 25 and was arrested
three days later and charged with national security violations for
his August 1988 trip.
   An arrest warrant has been issued for Hankyoreh reporter Yun
Chae-gol but action was delayed because Yun was hospitalized.
   Yun and nine other persons in jail were charged with failing to
report Suh's illegal trip to authorities, a crime in South Korea.
   Reporter Yun allegedly learned of Suh's trip while accompanying
leading opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, head of the Party for Peace
and Democracy, on a tour of Europe in February. Suh was on the trip
as a party lawmaker.
   Authorities said Suh approached the reporter, suggesting a story,
but changed his mind later and the story was never written. Party
leader Kim has said he had no prior knowledge of the trip.
   Reporters at the newspaper said intelligence agents arrived at
the gate to the newspaper compound at 7 a.m. and when protesters
refused to let them in, they forced open the gate with hammers.
   Witnesses said the agents and police raced to the second-floor
editorial room, forced open a glass door and with the help of a
homemade map found reporter Yun's desk and files.
   Hankyoreh reporters said the agents took 23 photographs, some
allegedly taken in North Korea, and some sheets of pink memo paper
with a North Korean letterhead. They looked at, but did not take,
the reporter's notebook on his interview with Suh.
   One agent was quoted as saying, ``We return reporter Yun's
notebook in the spirit of protecting sources.''
   The state-run Korean Broadcasting System said investigators also
took a draft of a report Suh allegedly made to North Korean leader
Kim Il Sung.
   Chairman Chang Yun-hwan of the paper's editorial comittee and
another ranking member of the paper offered to resign to take moral
responsibility for the action against the paper.

   This month's Iranian presidential election
appears a one-horse race dominated by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani and if the Tehran media is anything to go by, the result
is a foregone conclusion.
   A poll published Tuesday by the radical Abrar daily, which has
been critical of Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatist faction in the
past, indicated that 86 percent of Iranians will vote for him in the
July 28 balloting.
   Eleven percent said they would vote for his challenger, former
Agriculture Minister Abbas Sheibani of the Freedom Movement, Iran's
token opposition party.
   Three percent said they would not vote in the election, given
special significance because it comes so soon after the June 3 death
of fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The transition of power has been smooth so far, despite fears of
a struggle between Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatists and
hard-liners led by Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani, 55, has emerged as the political strongman with his
ally, incumbent President Ali Khamenei, chosen as Khomeini's
successor as religious leader.
   The radicals have not challenged Rafsanjani in the presidential
election. Political analysts believe Rafsanjani has so far been able
to outmaneuver his rivals, but that the months ahead could be
turbulent.
   Rafsanjani and Sheibani, a member of the Islamic republic's
parliament since it was formed in 1980, were the only two of 80
presidential hopefuls whose candidacies were approved by the
12-member Council of Guardians, a constitutional watchdog.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted council member Hojatoleslam Mohammad Yazdi as saying
most were disqualified because they lacked religious commitment and
sought to run ``simply to become a sort of celebrity for ambitious
purposes.''
   Sheibani ``doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell,'' said an
Iranian business executive who was in Nicosia several days ago.
``Everyone knows that Rafsanjani will win. It's no contest.''
   Rafsanjani is a formidable political figure who was considered
the second most powerful figure in Iran when Khomeini was alive.
   He has been speaker of the 270-seat Majlis, or Parliament, for
eight years. In last year's parliamentary elections, he polled 1.3
million votes, the most in th balloting.
   Sheibani is less well known. His Freedom Movement is led by Mehdi
Bazargan, the republic first prime minister, and barely tolerated.
It is only allowed to function as a token opposition.
   ``Sheibani's was allowed to run for cosmetic purposes so that
Rafsajani would not be the only candidate,'' the Iraq-based
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors who form the main rebel
movement against the Tehran government, said in a statement. It has
branded the poll ``a farce.''
   A referendum on constitutional reforms will be held the same day
as the presidential election, the fifth since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
   Iran's estimated 23 million voters are widely expected to endorse
the proposed reforms. These include greatly enhancing the executive
powers of the presidency in an effort to eliminate competing power
centers that have paralyzed the decision-making process.
   That will involve scrapping the post of prime minister, currently
occupied by hard-liner Hussein Musavi.
   The new president is also expected to take control of much of
Iran's security apparatus, thus weakening Mohtashemi's power.
   Khamenei's second four-year term expires Oct. 5 and he is
forbidden by the constitution from running for a third term.
   He is the only Iranian president so far to have served a full
term since the republic was declared after the late Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi was toppled in 1979.
   The first president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, was forced out of
office by hard-liners in June 1981, 18 months after his election,
because of his liberal policies. He fled to France, where he lives
in exile.
   His successor, Mohammad-Ali Rajai, a former street vendor turned
revolutionary, was killed in August 1981, 37 days after his
election, by a bomb planted by the Mujahedeen.
   Khamenei, who was himself severely wounded in a June 1981
Mujahedeen bombing, was elected that October amid a systematic
crackdown by the radicals to eliminate their erstwhile leftist and
liberal allies.
   Khamenei won a landslide 95 percent of the 16.8 million votes
cast. Three other candidates polled just 4 percent between them.
   Despite the current outward appearance of unity, with even
radical diehards publicly endorsing Rafsanjani's candidacy, some
cracks have already appeared.
   Radical parliamentary deputy Abdolhamid Sharpasand resigned last
week, charging that power was being centralized ``in a few hands,''
a reference to Rafsajani and his allies.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Faces `Deep and Painful Cuts'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After pitching his role in the ``Massachusetts
Miracle'' during his presidential campaign, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
is winding down his final term trying to draw from a spending well
that has all but run dry.
   The darkest hour is expected Thursday, when Dukakis will announce
$500 million in ``deep and painful cuts'' from a budget just enacted.
   ``Personally, I regret this,'' he said, ``because Thursday is
going to be a dark day in the history of this commonwealth, and it
is all so unnecessary.''
   He said the spending vetoes will lead to thousands of state
employee layoffs, across-the-board cuts in government and the
possible elimination of some agencies.
   Dukakis said he has ``a constitutional responsibility, a
statutory responsibility and a practical responsibility to make sure
that over the course of the next 12 months, spending does not exceed
revenue, lest we go into the next fiscal year with an even worse
situation than we face this year.''
   Reductions in state aid to municipalities will mean ``fewer
teachers, fewer policemen, fewer firemen or more rubbish.
Essentially those are our choices,'' said Lexington Mayor Paul
Marshall.
   ``We've made serious cuts already,'' said council member Buzz
Stapczynski, the town manager of Wilmington. ``For us to make more
is going to be the proverbial blood in the street.''
   Since Dukakis' defeat in November's presidential election,
Massachusetts' credit rating has fallen through the floor and a
major income tax increase has loomed to pay off multimillion-dollar
deficits.
   ``We can either look at this as an ending or as a beginning,''
Dukakis told his local government advisory council Tuesday. ``I
prefer to look at it as a beginning, painful though it is.''
   Dukakis, who announced shortly after the election that he would
not seek a fourth term as governor in 1990, still believes he can
right the ship of state in the 1{ years left in his term.
   To do so when Massachusetts' economic ``miracle'' is experiencing
a comedown from the double-digit revenue growth of recent years will
take more taxes, he maintains.
   But Republican House Minority Leader Steven Pierce said Dukakis'
campaign for higher taxes has failed. Recent newspaper polls suggest
widespread opposition by voters, he said.
   ``There are times the public can be sold a tax increase,'' Pierce
said. ``But it most definitely has not happened with this one
because the taxpayers do not believe that spending has been
restrained or cut or reduced.''
   In January, the Democratic governor proposed $604 million in new
taxes to support a $12.9 billion fiscal 1990 budget. The House took
a tough no-new-taxes stand and slashed his budget accordingly.
   Now, the Legislature is considering a $793 million, 18-month
income tax increase just to pay off a $375 million deficit from
fiscal 1989 and $488 million in recently disclosed Medicaid bills
dating back a decade.
   Despite the Legislature's cuts in his fiscal 1990 budget, Dukakis
said he will have to slash $500 million to bring the enacted budget
in balance with lower revenue estimates and higher projected
Medicaid requirements.
   ``When the Legislature acted (without a permanent fiscal 1990 tax
increase), we warned them the veto pen ... would be more like a
knife,'' Dukakis said. ``And that's exactly what's going to happen.
   Through elimination of 2,500 state jobs and other cutbacks in
recent months, the governor said, ``we've been able at least until
now to maintain basic levels of services. That's not going to be
possible after Thursday. We are going to have deep and painful
cuts.''
   Of the $500 million in vetoes, $200 million is expected in local
aid to cities and towns, which had already reduced their
expectations to matching the previous year's funding.
   Dukakis may be able to balance fiscal 1990 with the vetoes, but
the troubles won't end there.
   Members of his local government advisory council told him they
are collecting support for a possible 1990 ballot initiative to
guarantee that towns and cities will receive their fair share of
state aid in the future.
   And a coalition of anti-tax advocates and chambers of commerce
also are planning a 1990 ballot proposal to win back the extra money
that will be going to the temporary income tax increase.
   Although Dukakis has remained steadfast through the mounting
problems, he recently admitted, ``this hasn't been the best seven
months of my life.''

<HEAD>Government Says 2,800 Rebels Killed, Wounded or Captured In Past
Year</HEAD>

   Government forces killed,
wounded or captured 2,834 leftists guerrillas over the past 12
months, up slightly from the previous year, the defense minister
says.
   If the figures given Tuesday by Gen. Humberto Larios in his
annual report to the legislature are accurate, the casualties
represent about 40 percent of the guerrilla army _ estimated at
6,000 to 7,000 combatants.
   Furthermore, if the general's figures are correct, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front has been extremely successful in
attracting new recruits because its fighting force is not considered
to have diminished.
   The insurgents maintain a constant and active presence in about a
third of this Massachusetts-sized country.
   Last year, 2,766 guerrillas were killed, wounded or captured,
according to government figures. Larios said 455 government soldiers
were killed in the year prior to June 1. He gave no breakdown of
guerrilla dead and wounded.
   Foreign journalists and other independent observers consider both
army and rebel figures on enemy casualties inflated.
   Reporters have found that official and insurgent figures rarely
coincide with the number of bodies discovered following combat.
   Larios, named to his post last month by President Alfredo
Cristiani, said the six nationwide elections held this decade
demonstrate ``rejection of the communist delinquents' hypothesis
that economic, political and social problems can only be resolved by
violence.''
   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, took
office from Jose Napoleon Duarte of the Christian Democratic Party
on June 1. Duarte is terminally ill with cancer and was prevented by
law from seeking re-election.
   The Salvadoran military receives $85 million a year in aid from
the United States, more than any armed forces in the Western
Hemisphere.
   Cristiani is trying to form a commission to represent the
government in talks with rebel representatives. Non-rightist sectors
have declined to participate, contending the proposed commission
would not have sufficient authority to negotiate peace.
   The rebels have said they will not participate in talks with any
commission that does not include sectors other than the governing
party and that does not have authority to negotiate. They say
Cristiani is trying to engineer their surrender through the
proposals for a dialogue.
   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the nearly 10-year civil war.

<HEAD>Wyoming Town Takes Exception to Discount Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KURT J. REPANSHEK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart's invasion of Wyoming is being
heartily endorsed by just about everyone _ except many Jackson
residents, who are aghast at the thought of having the discount
store as a neighbor.
   The department store chain has begun building stores in Cheyenne,
Laramie and Rock Springs. And plans include adding to the Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. empire in Gillette, Riverton and Jackson.
   In economically strapped Wyoming, the six stores mean roughly 800
jobs and millions of tax dollars.
   But in Jackson, the proposed store is being portrayed as an
eyesore that doesn't mesh with the resort community's Western motif.
   ``We all know what brings people here,'' said Larry Hendricks,
the assistant director of the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. ``We
advertise it as the last and the best of the old West. ... There are
already a lot of chains here, but none that in one fell swoop would
have such a visible impact.''
   Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brenda Lockhart believes the community can
only benefit from the outlet. ``Obviously, we would just like an
opportunity to be a contributor to the community, a good corporate
citizen,'' she said.
   Jackson residents are beginning to realize they can't keep
Wal-Mart out of town, said Hendricks, but that doesn't make the
company's plans any more palatable.
   A recent chamber meeting on the issue produced ``our best
attended general membership meeting in history,'' he said.
   Concerns include a fear that housing in the Jackson area is
insufficient to accommodate the 150 or so new jobs Wal-Mart would
create, and that Wal-Mart's new employees would be coming from other
businesses, said Hendricks.
   But the biggest concern apparently is that Wal-Mart wants to
build on ranchland south of the western Wyoming town of 4,500
residents. Tourists coming into Jackson from the south now see
haystacks and the Tetons before reaching town.
   One faction of residents say a rancher should be able to sell his
land to whomever he wants, others believe such a sale would destroy
``part of the very scenic values that draws people here,'' said
Hendricks.
   Across the state, Cheyenne leaders went out of their way to help
Wal-Mart plan the 110,580-square-foot store being built at the
capital's north end.
   ``I've heard mostly positive things about it, the sort of feeling
that competition is good for business and that that size of a store
would tend to draw more people from outlying areas into Cheyenne,''
Chamber of Commerce President Phil Noble said.
   When asked about Jackson's resistance, Noble expressed an
understanding, saying, ``The prairie out north Cheyenne is certainly
different than the Jackson Hole ambience.''
   Den Costantino, chairman of the Sweetwater Economic Development
Association, agreed, saying the Jackson residents rely on tourists
and want to maintain the Western flavor that surrounds the community.
   Wal-Mart's drive in Wyoming is simply part of its ambitious
expansion program, which aims to open 150 new stores this year. The
company, which operates roughly 1,300 stores in 25 states, has none
in Wyoming.
   ``Obviously, Wal-Mart would like to be in a lot of markets,''
Lockhart said. ``We've also announced entry into New Jersey, New
York and Pennsylvania recently.''
   Noble, Costantino and Maureen Murphy, executive director of the
Laramie Chamber of Commerce, believe Wal-Mart will bring new
customers to their towns.
   As for increased competition, Costantino, who owns a men's
clothing store, said: ``It makes everybody healthy.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell.
   The dollar closed at 140.50 yen, up 0.88 yen from Tuesday's
139.62-yen finish. The currency opened at 140.70 yen and moved
between 140.40 yen and 140.95 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 45.25
points, or 0.13 percent, ending the day at 33,701.52. The index, a
70.75-point gainer Tuesday, added 66.66 points in early morining
trading.
   Dealers said the market was directionless as investors were
unable to decide whether they should buy or sell amid political
uncertainties ahead of a July 23 parliamentary election despite the
downward trend in the U.S. interest rates.
   It is widely expected that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
will lose badly in the upcoming upper house election, hurt by an
influence-pedddling stock scandal, an unpopular 3 percent
consumption tax and Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's reported
involvement with paid mistresses.
   Investors are reluctant to buy due to fears that the LDP's
election loss will result in a market plunge.
   A dealer with New Japan Securities Co. said the index fell
sharply within 30 minutes of morning trading, when foreign investors
sold spot issues and bought futures issues in arbitrage deals, but
the index made up most of the losses later. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's strength followed
its uptrend in New York as no other major U.S. banks followed Chase
Manhattan Bank's lead in cutting the prime lending rate.
   The New York bank cut the rate by 0.5 percent Monday to 10.5
percent.
   Lower U.S. interest rates decrease the value of
dollar-denominated investments.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader said many Japanese players took a
wait-and-see position in anticipation of an economic summit of major
industrialized countries in Paris beginning Friday and releases of a
variety of U.S. economic indicators the same day.
   Among the U.S. indicators to be released in Washington on Friday
are the producer price index, industrial production and retail sales.

<HEAD>Judge Makes Ban on Illegitimate Children Part of Man's Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legal observers question a judge's order
that a man with six illegitimate children could have no more
children except with his wife, but doubt the sentence violates the
man's constitutional rights.
   Bill McAninch, a professor at the University of South Carolina
Law School, pointed out on Tuesday that state laws prohibit
fornication and adultery and terms of probation require that all
state laws be obeyed.
   ``I suppose the condition is not to violate a criminal law. I
guess what he's doing is just singling out one part of the law,''
McAninch, a specialist in criminal and constitutional law, said
after the sentence by retired Circuit Judge Frank Eppes.
   Derone Suber was in court Monday to plead guilty to stealing a
truck when Eppes _ on special assignment in General Sessions Court _
turned the sentencing into an impassioned talk about the evils of
illegitimate children.
   Suber, 26, has six children from several different women. He
fathered his first child when he was 13.
   In his lecture, Eppes focused on the need for people to own up to
responsibility, particularly for the care of children if someone
chooses to become a parent.
   ``The state's got to pay for him and his children,'' said Eppes.
``This is one of the most tragic things I've seen in court in a long
time.''
   At first, Eppes wanted to make Suber visit schools or churches
twice a month.
   But Suber's attorney, W. Barry Bland, said his client, who walks
with the aid of a walker because of injuries suffered when he
crashed the truck he stole from the Spartanburg Sanitation
Department in 1986, would have difficulty meeting that sentence.
   So Eppes withdrew that condition and Suber was allowed to go.
   A few moments later, Eppes recalled Suber.
   ``I don't feel sorry for you. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at what
you've done,'' Eppes said. ``I feel sorry for those six children.''
   Eppes then sentenced Suber to 10 years for stealing the truck,
but suspended it to five years' probation. One condition of the
sentence is that Suber not have children with anyone but his wife
during that time.
   It's unlikely the issue would come to a head unless Suber
violated the terms of his sentence and Eppes found out about it and
decided to enforce the sentence, said Steven Bates, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's South Carolina
affiliate.
   ``I don't know how far judges can go in actually enforcing those
types of conditions,'' he said. ``It's difficult to be too critical,
however, because there is a need for a lot of creativity in
sentencing people. Just putting people in jail is not going to solve
problems in the long run.''
   Bland said he may appeal his client's sentence.

<HEAD>Railways, Docks, London Subway, Local Councils Hit By Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikes today paralyzed the national rail network,
the London subway, the port of London, 41 other British docks and
local government services across the nation.
   The 24-hour national rail strike by the National Union of
Railwaymen was its fourth Wednesday stoppage in as many weeks. And
the daylong strike by London subway drivers is their 10th since
April 5.
   This has been the worst week of labor unrest since Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher came to power 10 years ago, and polls show the
popularity of her governing Conservative party sinking.
   On Monday and Tuesday, rail services were badly disrupted by a
ban on overtime by train drivers belonging to another union, the
Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.
   Today's rail strike followed the breakdown Tuesday night of 12
hours of talks between British Rail managers and rail unions when
union representatives walked out.
   Union leaders said the board that runs the state-owned rail
network had upped its wage increase offer to 8.8 percent from 7
percent. The union is demanding 10 percent.
   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, accused British Rail of being a `cheapskate.''
   Railmen also want British Rail to cancel its decision to end
national pay bargaining on Oct. 31 and replace it with regional
negotiations. That issue was also not resolved in the
labor-management talks.
   Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament Tuesday: ``Once again it is some of
the extreme left wing in the trade unions who never think of serving
the public or of their duty to the public.''
   A survey of public opinion polls Tuesday by the British
Broadcasting Corp. indicated Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives are now
trailing Neil Kinnock's opposition Labor Party in popularity by a
10-point margin.
   Britain's rising annual inflation rate, now at 8.3 percent, its
highest in seven years, has eaten into wages, leading to pay demands
and unpopularity for the government.
   A National Opinion Polls survey among 2,770 rail passengers
published today in the Conservative London newspaper the Daily Mail
said 33 percent blamed poor British Rail management for the strikes
and other disruption. Twenty-three percent blamed the rail unions
and 20 percent blamed the government.
   The Transport and General Workers Union, meanwhile, said 96
percent of its 9,400 registered dock workers stayed off the job
Monday, the first day of their indefinite strike.
   The strikers are protesting the government's abolition of 1947
legislation that replaced daily hiring at 60 ports with guaranteed
jobs for dock workers. They voted 3-to-1 to strike after port
employers refused to replace the so-called National Labor Dock
Scheme with private guarantees.
   The National Association of Port Employers said 42 of the 60
powers were hit by the strike. It said the other 18 plus the 102
non-scheme ports were working normally.
   A 48-hour pay strike by members of the National And Local
Government Officers' Association employed by local councils entered
its second day today. It is the second stoppage called by the union
in two weeks.
   It has shut down local government services ranging from libraries
and day care centers for the handicapped to garbage collection and
local tax offices. The union said nearly half a million members are
on strike.

<HEAD>Castro Accuses U.S. of Withholding Information on Drug Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 16th graf.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro has accused the United
States of withholding information that he says could have helped
Cuba uncover sooner a drug ring operating in the top ranks of its
military and government.
   The official news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City,
quoted Castro as telling Cuba's Council of State, ``The North
Americans had at least two names.'' There was no elaboration.
   Cuba announced last month that it had uncovered the
drug-smuggling ring. The disclosure followed years of denials by
Castro of U.S. allegations that Cuba had become a way station in the
cocaine and marijuana trade.
   The Council of State, which Castro chairs, on Sunday unanimously
upheld a court-martial's death sentences for cashiered Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa, a war hero convicted of running the ring, and three
alleged close collaborators.
   Castro said Cuba had once warned U.S. officials about a plot to
assassinate former President Reagan and said the courtesy should
have been repaid with information about the narcotics ring.
   Prensa Latina said Cuban intelligence told Washington the
assassination plot involved ``reactionary elements'' in the southern
United States who had planned to kill Reagan the next time he
visited their state.
   It did not provide further details.
   Excerpts of Castro's Sunday speech were broadcast Tuesday night
on Cuban television and reported early today by Prensa Latina.
   Castro said Ochoa and the three others must face a firing squad
to restore faith in the Cuban revolution, ensure discipline in the
armed forces and set an example. No date of execution was given.
   The 29-member council also upheld prison sentences ranging from
10 to 30 years for 10 other defendants. All has been officials in
the military or the Interior Ministry security service.
   The council was the final court of appeal, the news agency said.
   Castro said he did not try to influence the council's decision.
He said he asked each of its members for their points of view but
``I never said a word about what I thought.''
   He said the drug scandal had eroded Cuba's international image
and crippled the tourism industry it has been trying to foster.
   Castro's comments about the United States were harsh.
   He accused Washington of trying to discredit his brother and
heir-apparent, Defense Minister Raul Castro, through a propaganda
campaign. Officials in Washington had suggested that Ochoa's
prosecution may have been politically motivated.
   The president said he had ordered Vice Foreign Minister Ricardo
Alarcon to tell an unnamed U.S. official that ``the people who are
spreading these accusations are sons of bitches.''
   He said that if U.S. intelligence officials had been frank and
discreet, Cuba would have taken the drug trafficking charges more
seriously and been able to expose the drug ring sooner.
   It was only after ``friends of ours in Colombia'' came forward
with information about Cuban involvement in the drug trade that the
allegations were taken seriously, he said.
   Ochoa and the others were convicted of collaborating with the
Medellin cartel in Colombia, the world's largest cocaine ring.
   Castro said it was ``supremely grave'' that ``a member of the
Central Committee, a Hero of the Republic, a general of a division,
a man with the prestige Ochoa had'' could become so corrupt.
   Ochoa fought alongside Castro in the revolution that overthrew
dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. He went on to become a trusted
aide who carried out confidential missions for the president.
   He is one of only five officers ever awarded Cuba's highest
medal, the Hero of the Republic. Ochoa, 57, was decorated for his
service as a field commander in Ethiopia and Angola. He also headed
the Cuban military mission in Nicaragua.
   Castro repeatedly sought to distance himself from the
now-discredited Ochoa, who is also accused of doing a lucrative
black market business on the side while in Angola that involved
diamonds, ivory, rare woods and military supplies.
   Castro said commuting Ochoa's sentence could create an impression
of impunity that might destroy discipline in the armed forces.
   Ochoa and the others were convicted on Friday. They had earlier
been stripped of all rank and honors and given dishonorable
discharges.

   Firefighters traditionally
battle wildfires with shovels and bulldozers, but those tools are
too damaging to use on a fire threatening an ancient Indian site.
   ``We're not going to compromise the archaeology of the area to
put a bulldozer line in,'' said Paul Hefner, a U.S. Bureau of Land
Management firefighter assigned to the blaze in southwest Colorado.
   ``We're very sensitive to that. We've got to stop this fire, but
not at that cost,'' he said.
   About 400 firefighters and several archaeologists worked to
contain the blaze Tuesday. The fire was triggered Saturday by a
lightning strike, forcing closure of the popular park that houses
numerous ancient cliff dwellings occupied in the 13th century by the
Anasazi Indians.
   The dwellings are in canyons and have not been damaged by fire,
said Charles Harnish, a fire information officer.
   San Juan National Forest Archaeologist Gary Matlock, one of seven
or eight archaeologists who worked with fire crews, said the blaze
also was not damaging ground archaeological sites on the mesas above
the canyons.
   ``They have been through fires before in the 800 years they've
been there,'' he said. ``It's moving right over them.''
   The archaeologists mark the sites so firefighters avoid damaging
or disrupting them, said Linda Martin, district interpreter for the
Chapin Mesa district at the park. The scientists also are on hand in
case firefighters run across a significant find.
   ``Ordinarily, they would just bring in a 'dozer and clear the
area, but there is too much to be lost here for that,'' she said.
   In addition to the cliff dwellings, the archaeologists are
concerned mainly with surface finds such as campsites and kivas,
large rooms used for religious and other purposes.
   Many surface finds have been burned before in the nearly 800
years since they were abandoned, she said. ``The earlier fires have
damaged some of the surface material of the finds, but under the
surface there is still a great potential for finding more,'' Martin
said.
   ``One of the things the archaeologists are doing is studying the
effects of heat on the pottery. The heat has already damaged the
sandstone of the structures. It discolors them,'' she said.
   Firefighter Curtis Miller said working with the archaeologists
was no trouble.
   ``We would clear the brush, then an archaeologist would come
through and mark it before we cut the actual hand line,'' he said.

<HEAD>Photographer Who Fled Hungary Returns With Bush 38 Years Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photographer Charles Tasnadi jumped down
the steps from Air Force One to the ground and thrust his fists
upward in triumph. He had returned to his native Hungary after 38
years.
   ``If I won $1 million, I wouldn't feel better,'' Tasnadi said on
the two-hour flight from Warsaw, Poland, to Budapest. Peering out
the window as President Bush's plane landed Tuesday, the Associated
Press photographer muttered to himself, ``Moment of truth.''
   But as soon as he hit the ground, Tasnadi went to work, trotting
across the tarmac in a heavy rain to photograph Bush's arrival.
``Welcome home, Charlie,'' his colleagues told him.
   As he focused his camera on Bush, his hands shook. But the
emotions of the moment were blunted by his preoccupation with
getting good pictures.
   Tasnadi had fled Hungary's communist dictatorship as a
25-year-old man, crawling to freedom through heavy snow and
treacherous minefields. He returned Tuesday as a 64-year-old
naturalized American, an AP photographer covering the first visit by
a U.S. president to Tasnadi's homeland.
   His story was well known to Bush, and the president summoned the
photographer to a forward cabin on Air Force One to offer his
congratulations during the flight from Warsaw.
   Tasnadi said Bush had told him that ``he was very happy that I
was here. He said it was most fitting and proper that I return this
way.''
   The photographer's return was a poignant contrast to the way he
had left.
   Tasnadi, a championship skier, and his sweetheart, Maria, now his
wife, joined a group of six other adults and two children in making
their escape from Hungary during the first heavy snowfall of the
1950-51 winter.
   He concocted a story about heading for the slopes, telling the
truth only to his mother who, by design, would report him missing
two days later.
   In the freezing cold, the group made its way across the border to
Austria. On the final, nightlong trek across the border, Tasnadi
carried one of the young children on his back.
   Once in Austria, the escapees took pains to elude Soviet guards
in the 50-mile Soviet zone of that nation. They arrived in Salzburg
several days later.
   It was a harrowing trip. The other child, carried by another man,
had to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting
the guards.
   ``And it was so miserably cold,'' Tasnadi said. ``Twice I fell
through the ice up to my chest. I couldn't even feel it.''
   Unexpectedly, Tasnadi said he was not overwhelmed with emotion
during his coverage of the welcoming ceremony for Bush in a downpour
in Lajos Kossuth Square.
   ``I never covered any presidential act in such a rain outside,''
Tasnadi said. ``I was so overwhelmed with the work and to cover the
president that it didn't hit me so deeply as I expected.''
   ``The weather messed up the whole arrival ceremony so there were
no national anthems,'' he said. Tasnadi had feared he would be
reduced to tears hearing the music.
   ``I just looked at this place and thought, my God, this is the
place where as a small boy, I was standing as honor guard'' with Boy
Scouts during civic ceremonies, he said.
   Tasnadi said he was surprised that so many Hungarians turned out
in bad weather to greet Bush.
   ``It shows how the Hungarian people feel about the United States
and this president,'' he said. ``This impressed me very deeply.''

   A relative of a 7-year-old murder
victim apparently took his own life at her gravesite, authorities
said.
   The body of a man identified as a relative of Sara Nan Hodges was
found by workers at Eternal Valley Memorial Park on Tuesday morning,
said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier.
   The identity of the man, who suffered a single gunshot wound to
the upper body, and his relationship with the girl were withheld
until family members could be notified, Ducoulombier said.
   The body of Sara Hodges was found hidden in a house near her home
March 26, three days after she was reported missing.
   Curtis Cooper, 14, was charged with murder and sexual molestation
charges in the girl's death. He faces trial Aug. 24.

<HEAD>Former Mass. Congressman Dead at 95</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurence Curtis, who served five terms in Congress,
has died at age 95.
   Curtis died Tuesday at at Brigham and Women's Hospital. No cause
of death was given.
   Curtis, a Republican from Brookline, also had served one term as
state treasurer, three terms as state senator, two as state
representative and two as Boston city councilor.
   He served in Congress from 1953 to 1962. In 1962, he lost the
Republican primary for a U.S. senate seat to George Lodge,
35-year-old son of former U.S. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge.
   The younger Lodge lost the general election to Edward M. Kennedy.
   Curtis was unsuccessful in seeking to regain a seat in Congress
in 1968, 1970 and 1972.
   In 1974, when he was 81, Curtis won in an unopposed Republican
primary election for Congress but dropped out the next day, saying
he thought his chances against the Democrat incumbent, the Rev.
Robert J. Drinan, were slim.
   ``With Watergate behind us, the party can get a better
candidate,'' he said.
   In Congress, Curtis served on the House Judiciary and the Foreign
Affairs committees. He thought of himself as middle-of-the-road, but
many regarded him as conservative.
   He was graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and
served for one year with the foreign service, attached to the U.S.
Embassy in Paris.
   He joined the Naval Reserve Flying Corps when World War I started
and lost a leg in a flight training accident.
   He is survived by his wife. A memorial service is scheduled for
Tuesday.

   A federal appeals court has blocked the widow of a
Challenger astronaut from suing the government for the 1986 space
shuttle disaster.
   In its ruling Tuesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said Jane J. Smith may take action under the Federal Tort
Compensation Act, passed in 1988 to handle claims against government
employees for acts committed in the scope of their employment.
   Mrs. Smith, widow of Navy Commander Michael J. Smith, sued the
United States and Lawrence B. Mulloy, a civilian manager of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's rocket booster
program.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit agreed with a U.S.
District Court in Florida's dismissal of the suit, noting such
action against the United States is barred.
   It also said legal precedent blocks action against civilian
government employees when injury to a person in military service
takes place during military-related activity.
   The decision noted that Mrs. Smith has reached a settlement with
the manufacturer of the faulty part that caused the explosion.

   The U.S. dollar was mixed today in directionless
trading in Europe. Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said the markets were correcting last
week's sharp decline and were waiting for U.S. economic indicators
to be released on Friday.
   ``We're in a consolidation phase right now,'' said a trader at a
large West German bank in Frankfurt. ``There's a lot of
position-squaring before Friday going on.''
   Traders said market activity was subdued because many London
traders were absent due to a rail and subway strike.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.88 yen to a closing 140.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 140.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8808 West German marks, up from 1.8795
   _1.6215 Swiss francs, up from 1.6160
   _6.3785 French francs, up from 6.3740
   _2.1213 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1180
   _1,363.50 Italian lire, down from 1,364.50
   _1.1902 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the dollar gained slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.6235 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6270 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $380 a troy ounce, compared with late
Tuesday's $380.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $379.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379.40, little changed from $379.75
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 91 cents to close at $380.87.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.26 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's $5.27.

<HEAD>Housekeeper: Mrs. Helmsley Said She Didn't Pay Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leona Helmsley once made her housekeeper pay for
food for her estate and boasted that ``only the little people pay
taxes,'' the servant testified at the hotel magnate's tax evasion
trial.
   Elizabeth Baum also said her salary and those of other staff
members were paid by Helmsley businesses.
   Ms. Baum, who spoke with a heavy European accent, said she was
talking with Mrs. Helmsley at the Dunnellen Hall estate in
Greenwich, Conn., four to six weeks after she was hired in September
1983.
   ``I said, `You must pay a lot of taxes,''' Ms. Baum said. ``She
said, `We don't pay taxes, only the little people pay taxes.'''
   Seated at the defense table, Mrs. Helmsley, 69, shook her head no.
   She is accused of tax evasion for allegedly disguising $4 million
in renovations and operating costs at the estate as business
expenses. Two former aides, Frank Turco and Joseph Licari, are
charged with assisting in the scheme.
   Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was indicted with Mrs. Helmsley
in April 1988 but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
   Mrs. Helmsley and Turco also are charged with extorting payoffs
from companies doing business with the Helmsleys' $5 billion real
estate and hotel empire.
   Ms. Baum testified that she ordered groceries and household
supplies for the mansion from the Park Lane Hotel. The items were
delivered every week in a hotel van.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Seibel asked if she ever purchased
food locally. Ms. Baum said only on a few occasions.
   ``I bought something for the house that we ate,'' she said. She
testified that when she asked Mrs. Helmsley to reimburse her, Mrs.
Helmsley said, ``You bought it, you pay for it.''
   Ms. Baum said she was fired by Mrs. Helmsley in March 1984. One
Sunday, Mrs. Helmsley called her from the kitchen, ``screamed and
yelled and cursed at me'' and told her she was fired, Ms. Baum said.
   She said when she went upstairs to pack her belongings, Mrs.
Helmsley summoned her again and said everything was fine and she
could stay.
   The next day, Turco called her and said Mrs. Helmsley wanted her
off the estate.
   ``Were you told by Mr. Turco what you had done to cause this?''
Ms. Seibel asked.
   ``No,'' she replied.
   Under cross-examination by Mrs. Helmsley's attorney, Gerald
Feffer, Ms. Baum said Mrs. Helmsley was universally feared by the
staff.
   ``She screamed at everyone and people were scared of her. She was
very nasty,'' Ms. Baum said.

<HEAD>Two Dead, 19 Wounded as Armenian Enclave Scene of Renewed Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Two people were shot to death and 19 soldiers
wounded as ethnic violence flared anew in Nagorno-Karabakh, the
predominantly Armenian enclave in the southern republic of
Azerbaijan, news reports said today.
   A 1 a.m.-5 a.m. curfew remained in effect in the disputed region
and a two-month-old strike kept most businesses closed, according to
the reports.
   Tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh,
which neighboring Armenia seeks to annex, have run high since
February 1988. Ninety people have died in the region in ethnic
disputes over the last year.
   Various reports said two Azerbaijanis were killed and a third
seriously hurt Tuesday near the village of Kirkidzhan, but the
circumstances remained unclear.
   The official news agency Tass and the chief editor of
Azerbaijan's official news agency Azerinform said the victims were
shot in an ambush. The Azerinform editor said by telephone from the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku that ``extremist Armenians opened fire
with hunting rifles.''
   Tass said groups fired shots at each other Monday, and that on
Tuesday Armenians blocked roads with iron plates and telegraph poles
in Stepanakert, the administrative center of Nagorno-Karabakh. Also
in the region, Azerbaijanis made barricades out of cars in the
village of Khodzhali, the agency said.
   A crowd on Tuesday pelted soldiers clearing roads around
Stepanakert with stones and fired at them with hunting rifles,
wounding 19 troops, the news agency reported.
   ``It's turned into a Lebanon,'' the Azerinform editor said,
referring to the persistent fighting in the Middle Eastern country.
   Declining to be identified, he added, ``Armenians are waging an
organized battle to turn Nagorno-Karabakh into an arena of
confrontation to upset the balance with the Azerbaijani population.''
   State radio and TV broadcast appeals by authorities for calm, the
editor said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of 162,000 people, has been part of
Azerbaijan since 1923 but Armenians claim that Azerbaijanis
discriminate against them.
   In January, authorities in Moscow placed Nagorno-Karabakh under
Kremlin management.

<TEXT>
   Starting with a 448-foot leadoff home run
in baseball's All-Star Game, Bo Jackson was in control.
   The American League beat the National League, 5-3, in Tuesday's
contest, which provided a showcase for Jackson's talents.
   Jackson drove in two runs, stole a base and made a nifty running
catch, earning him honors as the most valuable player of the game.
   ``See Bo hit, see Bo run, see Bo do anything,'' Los Angeles
Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser said.
   The only other player to hit a homer and steal a base in an
All-Star game was Willie Mays, in the second game in 1960.
   The home run by Jackson, who plays baseball for the Kansas City
Royals and football for the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders, was followed
by a homer by Boston's Wade Boggs.
   California's Nolan Ryan, at 42 the second-oldest pitcher in
All-Star history, was the winner and Atlanta's John Smoltz, the
youngest pitcher in the game, was the loser.
   The National League now leads the All-Star series, 37-22-1. But
the American League has reason to cheer: It won last year, too,
giving it consecutive victories for the first time since 1957-58.

<HEAD>New Orleans D.A. Draws Fire for Campaign to Criminalize Performing
Abortions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEVEL JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union promised to
fight the district attorney in his campaign to make performing an
abortion a crime.
   ``Louisiana is a major battleground,'' ACLU Director Shirley
Pedler said at a news conference Tuesday at a New Orleans abortion
clinic. ``It is the first state to try to criminalize abortion, even
without grounds to do so.''
   Earlier Tuesday, a half-dozen members of the National
Organization of Women picketed District Attorney Harry Connick's
office. Among the protestors was a 10-year-old girl wielding a large
placard that said: ``Harry, you oppressor.''
   Meanwhile, pro-choice protesters in Florida demonstrated against
Gov. Bob Martinez's call for a special legislative session on the
issue come fall, and a Louisiana judge ignored a prosecutor's
request for fines and sentenced dozens of anti-abortion protesters
to a day of community service instead.
   Connick filed documents Monday asking a federal district judge to
lift a 1976 injunction prohibiting enforcement of a law making it a
crime to perform an abortion.
   Under the law, a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable
for punishment, only the person who performs the procedure.
   Judge Martin Feldman will hold a hearing on the matter Aug. 9.
   Connick said the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 decision upholding
Missouri restrictions on abortion prompted his action. Connick said
the decision leaves open the possibility that more restrictions
might be deemed legal.
   In a broadcast interview Tuesday, Connick said he hoped his
actions would lead the high court to reconsider the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade case establishing a woman's right to abortion.
   ``Why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another
shoe to fall?'' Connick asked.
   Pedler called Connick's action irresponsible. She said the ACLU
will argue at the hearing that the injunction barring enforcement of
Louisiana's law should not be lifted as long as Roe vs. Wade is
intact.
   On the small picket line at Connick's office, Michelle Gross of
NOW said Connick was simply playing politics.
   ``Mr. Connick doesn't care anything about women,'' she said. ``He
doesn't care anything about fetuses. He cares about Harry Connick.
He is using this as grandstanding to get re-elected.''
   In South Miami, Fla., hundreds of sign-waving pro-choice
demonstrators surrounded a shopping mall to confront Martinez, but
he ignored their chants on his way into a charity fund-raiser _ the
local opening of the James Bond movie ``Licence To Kill,'' in which
he has a bit part.
   The demonstrators, including some striking Eastern Airlines union
members angered by what they called the governor's indifference to
their plight, tried hard to make Martinez hear their message anyway.
   ``Bob Martinez, there's no doubt, we'll work hard to vote you
out,'' they chanted.
   In Gretna, La., Jefferson Parish Judge Bruce Naccari ordered 84
religious activists to do a day's community service for blocking the
entrance of a suburban New Orleans abortion clinic last October
because he believed they ``were acting out of conscience.''
   ``They felt they were saving lives,'' he said after Monday's
sentencing. ``I didn't feel comfortable with fining them. Many were
poor people.''

natural causes. He was 82.
   Knighted and ennobled, he was Lord Olivier when he died but still
plain Laurence Olivier on his stage and screen credits. Olivier was
at home in the plays of Shakespeare, Shaw and Chekhov, as well as
the movie thriller ``Marathon Man'' or the TV mini-series
``Brideshead Revisited.''
   His career took off with roles in Noel Coward's ``Private Lives''
and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' where he alternated the roles of Romeo and
Mercutio with John Gielgud.
   Olivier was the founding father of Britain's National Theatre and
a two-time Academy Award winner. His career was highlighted by a
triumphant procession of Shakespearean roles, from ``Romeo and
Juliet'' in 1935 and ``Hamlet'' in 1937 on stage to a TV production
of ``King Lear'' in 1983.
   He reached mass audiences with title roles and directors' credits
in ``Henry V'' in 1944, ``Hamlet'' in 1948, for which he won the
Academy Award as best actor, and ``Richard III'' in 1955. He brought
``Othello'' to the screen in 1965, a year after playing the jealous
Moor on the London stage.

   Sarah Caldwell, the force behind New
Hampshire's living will law that allows a doctor to abandon
extraordinary measures to keep a terminally ill person alive, died
July 5. She was 42.
   Caldwell suffered from multiple sclerosis. Officials are awaiting
autopsy results to determine the cause of death.
   She learned she had multiple sclerosis in 1982. Her son, Mark
Caldwell, said the news devastated her for a while, but she bounced
back and particularly was inspired to work on winning passage of the
living will legislation.
   In 1983 and 1985, the state House and Senate passed legislation
to let people die if their disease progressed to a stage requiring
machines to keep them alive. But then Gov. John Sununu vetoed it
both times.
   Caldwell counted votes from her wheelchair as the state Senate in
1985 overrode Sununu's second veto.
   She wept when the tally was read, and senators hugged her.

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia council members cite
ethics concerns in voting to cap outside income for top city
officials, but others call it a power play aimed at discouraging
Jesse Jackson from running for mayor.
   The council on Tuesday approved a bill sponsored by mayoral
hopeful John Ray that limits speaking fees and other honoraria to
$10,000 a year for the mayor and the 13 council members.
   ``Some of us who have been involved in the civil rights movement
have heard this before,'' said council member Frank Smith, who
opposed the bill. ``It looks like a cheap shot, and we always look
foolish when it looks like we're trying to keep someone from
running.''
   Jackson's advisers reported Tuesday that Jackson and his wife,
Jackie, will move from Chicago and establish legal residence in the
district this month to qualify for any potential mayoral campaign.
   The Washington Post quoted Jackson aides as saying the couple
will temporarily move into an apartment because renovations to the
house they own here are behind schedule. Candidates for mayor must
be legal residents of the district for at least a year before
election.
   Jackson, whose advisers have said he is ``strongly considering''
running for mayor in the 1990 election, was traveling in Egypt and
could not be reached for comment. The two-time Democratic
presidential candidate earns most of his estimated $200,000 annual
income from giving speeches and making appearances.
   The measure also would limit annual book royalty income to
$10,000 for the mayor and council chairman. No limits would be
imposed on income from other types of employment, but the mayor and
council members would for the first time have to report all sources
of outside income.
   The mayor's job pays $82,500 per year.
   The measure, which was passed by a voice vote, would take effect
in September if it is not vetoed by either Congress or Mayor Marion
Barry. Neither has indicated plans to veto the measure thus far.
   Smith indicated he thought it ironic that the council, which
includes three members who got their political starts in the civil
rights movement, would enact a bill that might discourage a
candidate from running for office.
   ``Those are the things we fought against,'' said Smith. ``They
used to say, `If blacks want to be kings and queens, they can go
back to Africa.' That's what we're doing here.''
   Ray has said he started considering the bill last year after city
residents criticized the council for voting itself a pay raise.
However, he did not explain why he waited to introduce it until
rumors of a possible Jackson mayoral candidacy surfaced.
   Ray did not return several phone calls placed by a reporter after
the council session ended.
   ``I was aware of the Jesse Jackson ramifications, sure I was,''
said council chairman David Clarke. ``It became a question of
timing. I was damned if I did and damned if I (had ignored it.)''
   Clarke, also a declared mayoral candidate, attached to the bill
the provision limiting income from book royalties.
   Council member H.R. Crawford scoffed at the need for an income
limit.
   ``Most people I talk to in the community would pay us $10,000
only to be quiet,'' Crawford said. ``Who on this council could earn
that much giving speeches?''
   Clarke said it's impossible to tell.
   ``I don't know how much anyone here makes,'' Clarke said.
``That's the point _ this bill will tell us.''
   Smith said the bill won't prevent Jackson from running, but could
cause political embarrassment for Ray, Clarke and the other council
members if he is elected.
   ``Things like this usually turn out to be shortsighted
mistakes,'' Smith said. ``The effect here is fairly obvious.''

   President Bush today got an unusual
souvenir to to take home from his historic visit to this communist
nation: an actual piece of the Iron Curtain.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth gave Bush a piece of the barbed wire,
enclosed in a brass case, from the barriers that used to separate
Hungary from the West.
   The Hungarians began dismantling the grim fences along its border
with Austria earlier this year.
   ``That is just beautiful. That's a marvelous symbol of this whole
visit,'' Bush told Nemeth.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III got an identical momento
after he and Bush concluded their morning of talks with the
Hungarian leaders at the Parliament building.
   Bush, clearly moved, read the inscription aloud to reporters. It
said:
   ``This piece of barbed wire is part of the Iron Curtain alongside
the Hungarian-Austro border. It palpably represented the division of
the European continent into two halves. It's dismantling was made
possible by the will of the Hungarian people in recognition of
peaceful coexistence and mutual interdependence.
   ``It's believed that the artificial physical and spiritual walls
still existing in the world shall collapse someday everywhere.''
   Later, in a speech at Karl Marx University, Bush said the barbed
wire fences had been ``the ugly symbol of Europe's division and
Hungry's isolation.''

   The father of a 7-year-old murder
victim spent the day at his daughter's grave, then put a shotgun to
his head and committed suicide, authorities said.
   A cemetery worker found the body of Wallace Scott Mann, 36, at
the Eternal Valley Memorial Park on Tuesday morning, the Los Angeles
County sheriff's department said.
   Mann's body, found over the grave of Sara Nan Hodges, apparently
had been there since Monday night, sheriff's Detective Ronnie
Lancaster said.
   The worker had seen Mann throughout the previous day, sometimes
sitting near the grave, sometimes watching it from his car and at
one point painting a smiling face and flowers on the headstone.
   Authorities recovered a note next to Mann's body expressing his
love for his daughter.
   Mann had been separated from his wife, Linda Hodges, for three
years at the time of Sara's slaying, officials said. Ms. Hodges said
Mann left a second note at his home in Ojai, saying he grieved over
the separation and Sara's murder.
   ```When they took away the visitation rights, they took away half
my life. When he killed her, he took away the other half,'' she
quoted the note as saying.
   Sara's body was found hidden in a house near her home March 26,
three days after she was reported missing.
   Curtis Cooper, 14, was charged with murder and sexual molestation
in the girl's death. He faces trial Aug. 24.

   A physician who has been jailed for nearly two
years for contempt of court has been placed in punitive confinement
after guards found her with contraband perfume and jewelry,
officials said.
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, serving an open-ended sentence for refusing
to divulge the whereabouts of her 7-year-old daughter in a child
custody battle with her former husband, was disciplined Monday, said
Pat Wheeler, spokeswoman for the District of Columbia Corrections
Department.
   ``She had some contraband,'' Ms. Wheeler told The Washington
Times. ``It was a bottle of perfume, earrings and a gold chain.''
   Under jail rules, prisoners cannot possess items that are not
purchased by corrections officials or are not available in the
prison canteen.
   Ms. Wheeler said after the items were found, Ms. Morgan was
placed in what was described as a section of the jail where
prisoners' movement outside their cells is limited to one hour per
day.
   The action was taken after a disciplinary review board composed
of ranking corrections officials upheld administrative charges
brought against Ms. Morgan.
   ``We do this for everyone's safety and for the orderly operation
of the facility,'' Ms. Wheeler said.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin today told
Chinese officials they must work harder to counter Western
``rumors'' about the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters last
month.
   Premier Li Peng promised that Chinese students abroad who
participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to China and
not punished.
   Li and Jiang were speaking at the end of a six-day conference of
151 ambassadors and other diplomats who were called back to Beijing
to discuss Chinese foreign policy in the wake of political turmoil
at home.
   Jiang was quoted on the national evening news as telling the
ambassadors and diplomats they must ``increase their work in
explaining the truth to counter rumors of Western reports.''
   Jiang said the diplomats must ``help foreign friends get rid of
their misunderstandings'' of China's suppression of the
pro-democracy movement.
   China says about 300 people, including many soldiers, were killed
when the military occupied Beijing on June 3-4 to end seven weeks of
student-led demonstrations. Chinese sources and Western intelligence
reports have put the death toll as high as 3,000.
   The United States and many Western nations have suspended
high-level contacts with China and frozen talks on new financial
assistance to China to show their outrage over the use of force.
   Many Western nations are allowing Chinese students to extend
their stays because of fears they face persecution if they return to
China. More than 2,000 people have been reported arrested for
joining protests.
   ``Because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the
Western media, they didn't understand the true situation and
participated in protests and said some extremist words,'' Li was
quoted as saying about students living abroad.
   He said the party is making a conscientious effort to tackle
problems such as corruption and unfair job assignments, key issues
during the demonstrations.
   Jiang said the turmoil showed China's leaders they must uphold
socialist principles and combat the trend toward ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or attraction to Western culture.
   He said China must educate the entire nation, particularly its
young people, in patriotism, and raise the level of national pride.
   China's concern about outside reaction to events at home was
expressed when the Communist Party's official newspaper urged the
rival government on Taiwan not to let the crackdown on dissent stand
in the way of improving ties.
   The appeal, in a front-page commentary in today's People's Daily,
came after Chinese police ordered two Taiwanese reporters out of the
country.
   Hsu Lu, who in September 1987 was the first Taiwanese journalist
to come to mainland China, said before leaving for Hong Kong that it
was ``very ironic'' the government that had so warmly welcomed her
was now expelling her.
   China on Tuesday deported Taiwanese reporter Huang Teh-pei after
holding him for eight days, and the People's Daily said China acted
leniently toward him for the sake of relations with Taiwan.
   Huang, a reporter for the Independence Morning Post, was accused
of violating martial law regulations that ban most reporting
activities. He also was accused of contacting a student dissident
wanted by police.
   Hsu, who works for the Independence Evening News, was accused of
violating martial law, reporting on a tourist visa and trying to
help a fugitive escape. She admitted receiving a call from Wang Dan,
a leader of the pro-democracy movement.
   Hsu said she told her interrogators, ``I got Wang Dan's phone
call and agreed to meet with him, but I never even saw him.''
   Her colleague, Huang, kept the appointment on July 2 to discuss
options for Wang's escape, but the two split up when they realized
their car was being followed. Security agents chased the car
carrying Wang.
   Huang said in Hong Kong on Tuesday that authorities told him Wang
had been arrested, but there has been no announcement.
   The People's Daily commentary acknowledged that the suppression
on the pro-democracy movement had hurt efforts to increase contacts
with Taiwan.
   ``The recent turmoils in some places on the mainland and the
counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing plus truth-distorting
propaganda by some Chinese and foreign news media have to some
extent had a negative impact on such activities,'' it said.
   The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war to the
Communists and fled to Taiwan in 1949, still bans official contacts
with the mainland, but in the past two years has eased restrictions
on non-governmental ties.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Pope Likely To Visit South Africa Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper said today
Pope John Paul II is expected to visit several cities in South
Africa early next year.
   Cardinal Owen McCann, Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, told The
Star of Johannesburg that the most likely date for a papal visit is
May 1990.
   McCann said he discussed the visit when he met with Vatican
officials and the pontiff in Rome last week.
   The Vatican has indicated that the pope is expected to travel to
Africa next year but says it is premature to discuss which countries
he will visit.
   The Vatican has strongly condemned the South African racial
segragation policies of apartheid, but the pope has indicated he
would be willing to visit.
   John Paul spent several hours in South Africa in September when
his plane was diverted because of bad weather on a flight from
Botswana to Lesotho.
   He visited five countries that border South Africa on that trip
and repeatedly called for an end to racial discrimination without
mentioning South Africa by name.

   The Palestinian uprising will have cost the
Israeli army at least $500 million by March 1990, a rate of more
than $500,000 a day, a military magazine reported today.
   In the occupied territories, masked assailants shot and wounded a
42-year-old woman suspected of helping the Israeli authorities, Arab
reports said. The attackers reportedly beat her husband, a distant
relative of Palestinian radical Abu Nidal.
   Soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinians, including a
3-year-old girl, while quelling stone-throwing protests in the Gaza
Strip, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In Israel's Galilee, five Arab Israelis and a Palestinian from
the West Bank were charged with attempted murder for a March 25
grenade attack on a police car.
   In its latest issue, the military weekly Bamahane quoted figures
on the cost of the uprising from Brig. Gen. Michael Navon, director
of the Defense Ministry's budget department.
   Navon was quoted as saying the army by March will have spent $500
million _ or about $575,000 a day _ in attempts to put down the
uprising. The uprising began in December 1987. He said these figures
did not include the losses to the economy caused by the rebellion.
   The Defense Ministry gave lower cost estimates when it prepared
its budget in February. Officials then estimated the uprising was
costing $12.5 million a month, which would amount to $350 million by
March 1990.
   In the uprising, 558 Palestinians have died. Thirty-five Israelis
have also been killed in the violence.
   The army today released figures showing that as of Sunday, 8,592
Palestinians were jailed for uprising-related acts. Of these, 1,857
are being held up to six months without trial.
   The alleged collaborator shot and wounded today was identified as
Rasmiyeh Mohammed Othman, 42, who was wounded near her home in
Nablus, Arab reports said. The assailants injured her husband with
sticks, the reports said.
   Her husband, Tark Banna, 52, is related to Abu Nidal, who leads
the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a violent Palestinian group based
in Syria and Lebanon. Nidal's real name is Sabri Banna.
   The Israeli Arabs charged today in the attack on a police car are
youths from Sakhnin in the northern Galilee, and the Palestinian is
from Jenin in the West Bank.
   Police Superintendent Gideon Arbel said the group had no known
ties any guerrilla group but added that their attack showed ``an
escalation in nationalist activity in the Galilee.''
   ``Throwing a hand grenade is the sort of activity we didn't face
before. It is a severe act,'' Arbel added.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 12 years after Elvis Presley died,
lawyers for his estate are wrangling with county officials over
$85,900 in unrefunded ticket sales for a concert that had been
scheduled six days after his death.
   ``Elvis is only entitled to a day's pay for a day's work and
since he didn't show up because he was dead, the ticket holders have
first claims,'' Edward O'Brien, attorney for Nassau County, said
Tuesday.
   ``We take the position that the public treasury is entitled to
the money after the ticket holders.''
   O'Brien spoke after a judge issued a preliminary ruling in favor
of the estate and Presley's promoter, who sued to recover $85,900 in
unrefunded ticket proceeds and $65,000 in interest.
   ``If ultimately, there is a windfall to someone, it should not be
to the county, which played no part in generating the proceeds,''
Nassau County State Supreme Court Justice Eli Wager wrote Tuesday.
   Wager reserved his final ruling until Sept. 19, so the state
comptroller can review the county's claims that it is entitled to
the money under the state Abandoned Property Law.
   A third of the 16,000 people who paid to go to the Aug. 22, 1977,
concert at county-owned Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale never claimed
refunds.
   ``The estate spent money to promote the tour, committed money for
travel and hotels ... If anybody deserve the proceeds it is not the
county,'' said John Brickman, attorney for estate executors
Priscilla Presley, Joseph Hanks, the National Bank of Commerce and
promoter Jerry Weintraub of Los Angeles.
   Presley's estate has filed similar lawsuits in other concert
locations and settled most of them out of court, Brickman said.

<HEAD>Japanese Beverage Maker To Discontinue 65-Year Trademark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Japanese beverage maker will stop using a
trademark portraying a top-hatted, thick-lipped black man sipping a
drink through a straw because some customers find it racist, the
company announced today.
   Nobuaki Hashimoto, spokesman of Calpis Food Industry Co., said
the company will discontinue the 65-year-old trademark by the end of
the year. The logo appears on labels of the company's top-selling
soft drinks and on advertising billboards across the country.
   ``In an age of internationalization, we cannot continue to use
the trademark if it gives unpleasant feelings to consumers,''
Hashimoto said.
   Calpis Food Industry began reconsidering the use of its logo in
February because of increased interest in the issue of racial
discrimination in Japan.
   In January, Japanese publishers stopped selling ``Little Black
Sambo,'' one of the most popular children's books in Japan, because
of the racist connotations the book carried.
   In August, Japan drew harsh criticism from the U.S. Congressional
Black Caucus for black mannequins and dolls, which caucus members
said stereotyped and degraded blacks by exaggerating their physical
features.
   Japanese department stores subsequently withdrew mannequins and
black dolls from their display windows and shelves.
   Japanese politicians also have been denounced for racism.
   Last summer, Michio Watanabe, the policy chief of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, said American blacks have few qualms about
going bankrupt and implied they walk away from debts.
   Two years ago, then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone caused a
   controversy when he said the overall U.S. intelligence rate was
brought down by the large numbers of blacks, Mexicans and Puerto
Ricans living in the country.
   
   Both men later apologized for their comments.
    Hashimoto said that before it decided to discontinue the logo,
the company conducted a survey of 36 Americans living in Japan, and
more than half of them said they found the logo offensive.
   Calpis Food, whose annual sales total $451.7 million, produces 80
million bottles of Calpis beverages a year, the official said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
speech as delivered Wednesday at Karl Marx University:
   Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Nemeth, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. and
Mrs. Csaki. It is a great pleasure for Barbara and me to be back in
Budapest, and I am very proud to be the first American president to
visit Hungary.
   Some might find it ironic that I am speaking at a university
named after Karl Marx. If you don't find it ironic in Hungary, try
it on for size in the United States.
   But the fact that I am here today is less a cause for surprise
than proof that America welcomes the unfettered competition of
ideas. And I understand that 50 or so of the faculty from this great
university have been, as either students or teachers, in the United
States of America. And that is a very good thing for my country, and
I'm glad you came our way.
   The university's principal task is to promote a competition, an
unfettered competition of ideas. And that is the spirit that brings
us together, a spirit that guided a great teacher at Karl Marx
University, whose name was Imre Nagy.
   As his funeral proceeded in Heroes Square a few weeks ago, the
rising voice of Hungary was heard reciting the Szozat. And in this
simple, somber ceremony, the world saw something more than a
dignified act, an act of reconciliation. We witnessed an act of
truth.
   It is on this foundation of truth, more solid than stone, that
Hungarians have begun to build a new future. A generation waited to
honor Imre Nagy's courage; may a hundred generations remember it.
   While Hungary rediscovers its natural role in the affairs of
Europe, the world again looks to you for inspiration.
   A popular non-fiction book in my country today is entitled
``Budapest, 1900.'' Dr. John Lukacs lovingly describes the Budapest
of memory, with its proud stock exchange and great opera, a time
when Europe's first electric subway ran underneath the handsome
shop, Andrassy Avenue _ a city that rivaled Paris in its splendor,
Vienna in its music, London in its literature, a center of learning
that enlightened the world and gave America one kind of genius in
Joseph Pulitzer, another in Bela Bartok.
   But for four decades, this great city, this great nation, so
central to the Continent in every respect, has been separated from
Europe and the West.
   And today, Hungary is opening again to the West, becoming a
beacon of light in European culture. And I see people in motion _
color, creativity, experimentation. I see a new beginning for
Hungary.
   The very atmosphere of this city, the very atmosphere of
Budapest, is electric and alive with optimism. Your people and your
leaders, government and opposition alike, are not afraid to break
with the past, to act in the spirit of truth.
   And what better example of this could there be than one simple
fact: Karl Marx University has dropped Das Kapital from its required
reading list.
   Some historians argue that Marxism arose out of a humane impulse.
But Karl Marx traced only one thread of human existence and missed
the rest of the tapestry, the colorful and varied tapestry of
humanity. He regarded man as hapless, unable to shape his
environment or destiny.
   But man is not driven by impersonal economic forces. He's not
simply an object, acted upon by mechanical laws of history. Rather,
man is imaginative and inventive. He is artistic, with an innate
need to create and enjoy beauty. He is a loving member of a family
and a loyal patriot to his people. Man is dynamic, determined to
shape his own future.
   The creative genius of the Hungarian people, long suppressed, is
again flourishing in your schools, your businesses, your churches.
And this is more than a fleeting season of freedom. It is Hungary
returning to its normal, traditional values. It is Hungary returning
home.
   Voices long stilled are being heard again. An independent daily
newspaper is now sold on the streets. Commercial radio and
television stations will broadcast everything from the news to the
music of Stevie Wonder. And Radio Free Europe is opening its first
Eastern European bureau right here in Budapest.
   Along your border with Austria, the ugly symbol of Europe's
division and Hungary's isolation is coming down, as the barbed wire
fences are rolled and stacked into bales.

   Government forces fired 100 rockets at
Moslem guerrilla bases in hills around the capital hours before the
government declared a cease-fire, authorities said today.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, the guerrillas rejected the cease-fire,
which was called to observe a religious holiday. ``The cease-fire
doesn't have any meaning for the guerrillas because we began our
fight to get rid of the communists and the problem is not solved,''
a rebel spokesman said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said in a dispatch from
Kabul that 44 guerrillas were killed and 62 wounded in artillery
battles in the Kabul area and elsewhere around the country.
   Tass said insurgents fired missiles Tuesday at the central mosque
in Kandahar while a religious service was in progress. It said eight
people were killed and 20 wounded. Battles also were reported
Tuesday in Kabul and the provinces of Ghor, Balkh, Fariab and
Badakhshan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 100 rockets
were fired late Tuesday into the Paghman Mountains, 12 miles
northwest of Kabul.
   ``We understand our brave armed forces have successfully carried
out the task given to them to destroy the (guerrilla) positions,''
Amani said. He did not have casualty figures.
   The rocket barrage preceded by a few hours the Tuesday midnight
start of a four-day cease-fire declared by the government to observe
the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice.
   ``We will not fire a single bullet (during the cease-fire), but
if we are fired upon, we will take up arms and destroy the
enemies,'' Amani said.
   President Najib's spokesman, Sarwar Yourish, said Tuesday the
troops would cease hostilities until midnight Saturday for the
holiday, which is held two months and 10 days after the end of
Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting.
   Amani said, ``We had information that the opponents had massed a
large number of rockets to hit Kabul during the Eid, so we carried
out a pre-emptive operation.''
   The guerrillas, supported by the United States and mostly based
in Pakistan, are trying to overthrow the Soviet-backed government
that seized power in a 1978 coup.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have alleged that the
guerrillas, along with Pakistani military advisers, are planning an
offensive on Kabul and Najib's government has warned that it may
shell Pakistan.
   Pakistan has denied Najib's charges that it is directly involved
in the attacks.
   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military involvement in
Afghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15 under
a U.N.-mediated accord. Moscow, however, has continued to supply
arms to the Kabul government.

   Ronald Reagan drove in with his entourage,
put on the headsets, checked out the microphone and went back to
what he does best _ talking to America.
   From San Diego street gangs to old movies to the Dominican
Republic, he had something to say, just like every other baseball
announcer. The former president was Vin Scully's color commentator
for the first inning of Tuesday night's All-Star Game won by the
American League, 5-3.
   And he seemed to like it.
   ``I've been out of work for six months,'' Reagan said. ``Maybe
there's a future here.''
   After retiring from the world of Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright,
Reagan returned for a night to the realm of Harry Caray and Phil
Rizzuto. Reagan was his old self _ a bit of humor, and some
memorized facts.
   ``Now, I get a little self-conscious when people can see what's
going on,'' the former radio announcer said while wrapping up his
25-minute stint.
   Like any good announcer, Reagan went down to the clubhouse before
the game to talk to the players. Unlike any other announcer, he
brought along dozens of Secret Service people who sealed and
unsealed corridors, trapping even baseball officials while he passed
through.
   AL president Bobby Brown took him through his league's clubhouse.
Bill White was to lead the National League tour but NL manager Tommy
Lasorda intervened and did it himself.
   Reagan had done most of his homework on Monday, meeting for an
hour with Scully and NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol. He took a
lot of notes, Ebersol said, and was worried about saying the obvious.
   It worked. He bandied about the statistics of National Leaguers
Tony Gwynn and Kevin Mitchell in a way his critics said he was never
able to do when he talked about the federal budget.
   ``He was tied up with the gangs when he was young in school,''
Reagan said of Mitchell. ``And his brother was killed in a gang
fight and he started out in them. But a remarkable person in his
family, his grandmother, took charge, and I understand she saw that
he got a good education. Now here he is away from the gangs, in
baseball.''
   At times, the 78-year-old Reagan just talked with Scully about
what it was like to have outlived many of the ballplayers he grew up
with.
   Scully: ``We were talking before about how baseball makes you
feel young, and when you come down here, I guess all of sudden you
have to figure a few years have fallen off.''
   Reagan: ``Well, yes. Particularly, when our host here tonight is
(Angels owner) Gene Autry and he's 81, and then (California coach)
Jimmy Reese down there, who threw out the first pitch, is 83, I feel
kind of like a kid.''
   Sports broadcasting is nothing new for Reagan. In the 1930s,
``Dutch'' Reagan recreated Chicago Cubs games from Western Union
teletype reports on WHO in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Reagan, who played George Gipp in ``Knute Rockne: All American,''
also was in a baseball movie once. Scully got that in while the
first batter _ St. Louis' Ozzie Smith _ was up.
   ``You wore a Cardinal uniform, as we look at Ozzie,'' Scully said.
   ``Not here in a stadium,'' Reagan said. ``I wore a Cardinal
uniform when I was playing Grover Cleveland Alexander in the
picture, `The Winning Team.' ''
   He even got into a little foreign territory when Scully mentioned
that Pedro Guerrero was from the Dominican Republic.
   ``They have quite a baseball training ground down there for our
major leagues,'' Reagan said.
   It's been a long time since Reagan followed baseball.
   ``Did you get a chance to watch any baseball, with all the
worldly pressures on your shoulders among other things?'' Scully
asked.
   ``Not as much as I would have liked,'' Reagan said. ``Here and
there. But you couldn't quite keep up with what all was going on.''

   Theater lights were dimmed and flags lowered as
Britain and the world paid tribute to the incomparable talent of
Laurence Olivier.
   Olivier died in his sleep Tuesday at age 82.
   Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined
former President Reagan in paying their respects to the actor many
regarded as the greatest of his time.
   But as Olivier would have wished, the shows went on and there was
virtually unanimous agreement that his legacy would continue in
playhouses worldwide.
   The founding father of Britain's National Theater and two-time
Academy Award winner left colleagues reaching for superlatives.
   His public pondered the significance of a career embracing
Shakespearean tragedy and Chekhovian comedy, the romantic and the
elegiac.
   ``He had more magic on the stage than any actor I have ever seen.
He was extraordinary _ he was irreplaceable,'' said Sir John Mills,
one of a generation of distinguished actor-knights. Of those,
Olivier, Sir John Gielgud and the late Sir Ralph Richardson were
considered the three finest.
   ``We became in some ways kind of rivals rather than colleagues,
which I was sorry about,'' Gielgud told the British Broadcasting
Corp. on Tuesday.
   ``But I wouldn't dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of
classical ability and comedy. He was a great comedian and a very
fine tragic actor.''
   Across London's West End, theater marquees dimmed their lights
for an hour. In New York City, Broadway theaters followed suit,
dimming their lights for one minute at curtain time.
   Flags were lowered to half-staff outside the National Theater and
the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace
of Shakespeare. The National's marquee said merely: ``Lord Olivier:
1907-1989.''
   Praise for Olivier began where his gifts first flowered _ on
stage.
   At the National Theater, which Olivier founded in 1963, veteran
actor Michael Bryant told the audience following a performance of
``The Voysey Inheritance'': ``I personally will not be lachrymose.''
   ``I'll be thinking of things like the Crispin's Day speech; `Now
is the winter of our discontent'; his young, magnetic, handsome
Heathcliff,'' said Bryant.
   He referred to Olivier's famed performances in Shakespeare's
``Henry V'' and ``Richard III,'' and as the tragic film hero in the
classic, ``Wuthering Heights.'' They were the three high points of
the late actor's long and distinguished career on stage, screen, and
television.
   At the National's Lyttelton theater, actor Edward Petherbridge
stopped a curtain call for ``The Misanthrope'' to ask the audience
to stand for a moment of silence before one final round of applause.
   ``I'd like us just to applaud especially in case he (Olivier) is
listening,'' Petherbridge said, his voice choked with emotion.
   A rare fusion of superb classical and extraordinary contemporary
actor, Olivier ``summed up the English theater,'' according to
theatergoer Pat Fairbairn, a civil servant.
   But another, Adeline Hartcup, said: ``His ego got in the way.''
   To most observers, Olivier was the consummate British artist: he
distinguished himself in theater and found fame and fortune on
screen.
   Olivier's adventuresome style freed the stage from the ``talking
heads'' elegance of some of his forbears.
   Actor Jeremy Brett said of Olivier: ``The thing one will always
remember is that however many times you'd seen him, it was probably
the most dangerously thrilling moment you'd seen on any stage.''
   Anthony Hopkins said he was constantly struck by the actor's
``tremendous athletic daring.''
   ``In order to test himself, he would hurl himself into the role,
and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body,'' said Hopkins,
who understudied Olivier in August Strindberg's ``Dance of Death''
in 1967. Hopkins went on to co-star alongside Olivier in the films
``A Bridge Too Far'' and ``The Bounty.''
   Denis Quilley, who starred with Olivier in a 1971 stage revival
of ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' said Olivier ``never gave up.''
   ``He worked like a dog and was never satisfied until he got what
he thought was right,'' said Quilley.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the man was cloaked in an aura of
greatness,'' Jack Lemmon said through his publicist. ``No actor that
I know of, that has lived in my lifetime, made me more proud to be
in the same profession.''
   Said Reagan: ``Sir Laurence Olivier delighted millions with his
unmatched excellence on the stage and screen. ... Some of the
greatest moments in the history of the performing arts came as a
result of Sir Laurence's brilliance.''
   Charlton Heston, a close friend who worked with Olivier in the
1966 film ``Khartoum,'' called him ``an amazingly daring actor, the
best of our time.
   ``I had the privilege of working with him on both stage and
screen and his advice to me has proven an inestimable value.''
   Olivier's vicar said today he will conduct a private funeral
service for the actor Friday at an undisclosed Protestant church.
   The Rev. Peter Burch, vicar of St. Andrew's Parish Church near
Olivier's home in Ashurst, 50 miles south of London, said the
service will be followed by cremation.
   A public memorial service will be held later in London, he said.
Details have not been announced.

<HEAD>15 AT&amp;T Employees Fired After Investigation Reveals Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWN AND COUNTRY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen employees of AT&amp;T's national
clearinghouse were fired following thefts up to $500,000, a
newspaper reported today.
   The thefts of telephones, typewriters and other equipment were
set up through a sophisticated computer scheme, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported in a copyright story. Sales employees would
set up fake local buyers for shipments from the clearinghouse in
suburban St. Louis, but the items actually went to friends and
relatives, or were sold on the street at cut-rate prices.
   Jim Tucker, president of Local 6320 of the Communications Workers
of America, said the union was told that AT&amp;T would seek criminal
theft charges against the former employees, who worked at AT&amp;T's
National Service and Sales Center here.
   Salespeople at the center handle purchases and service calls by
telephone for consumers and small businesses throughout the United
States.
   AT&amp;T officials acknowledged in a statement Tuesday that the
company was conducting an internal investigation involving ``loss of
revenue to the company'' and that some sales employees had been
fired. The company declined to give specifics ``because of the
continuing nature of the investigation.''
   The internal investigation began in April after apparent
irregularities were noted in AT&amp;T's ``Like for Like'' program, in
which equipment with service problems is replaced, union officials
said.
   Persons with problems with their AT&amp;T-purchased telephone or
other equipment can call the center and salespeople will dispatch
replacement equipment.
   In the theft scheme, replacement equipment was sent to people who
had never made the initial purchases.
   ``One young lady sent $40,000 worth of equipment _ typewriters,
telephones _ to a car wash,'' Tucker said. An accomplice signed for
the items when they were delivered; the AT&amp;T worker then tried to
sell them on the street for about $25 apiece, Tucker said.

<HEAD>BUDAPEST, Hungary: into bales.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, the Iron Curtain has begun to part and
Hungary, your great country, is leading the way.
   The Soviet Union has withdrawn troops, which I also take as a
step in overcoming Europe's division. And as those forces leave, let
the Soviet leaders know they have everything to gain and nothing to
lose or fear from peaceful change. We can, and I am determined that
we will, work together to move beyond containment, beyond the Cold
War.
   One of the key steps in moving beyond containment is easing the
military confrontation in Europe. To this end, the NATO allies
joined at the May summit meeting in my proposal of a comprehensive
conventional arms control initiative, an initiative that would cut
the number of tanks, armored troop carriers, artillery, combat
aircraft, attack helicopters, as well as United States and Soviet
troops stationed on foreign soil in Europe, all to lower, equal
levels.
   The issues may be complex, but we're working, day and night to
get a solid historic agreement to strengthen stability in Europe and
reduce the risk of war. And we are determined to get it soon.
   Now, there is no mistaking the fact that we are on the threshold
of a new era and there's also no mistaking the fact that Hungary is
at the threshold of great and historic change.
   You're writing a real constitution and you're moving toward
democratic, multi-party elections. And this is partly possible
because brave men and women have formed opposition parties, and this
is possible because Hungarian leaders are going to show the ultimate
political courage, the courage to submit to the choice of the people
in free elections.
   But to succeed in reform, you'll need partners, partners to help
promote lasting change in Hungary. And I am here today to offer
Hungary the partnership of the United States of America.
   Three vital spheres stand out in our partnership: economics, the
environment, and democratic and cultural exchange. The United States
believes in the acceleration of productive change, not in its delay.
   So this is our guiding principle: The United States will offer
assistance not to prop up the status quo, but to propel reform.
   Of course, the weight of the past still burdens Hungarian
enterprise. There are remnants of the Stalinist economy _ huge
inefficient industrial plants and a bewildering price system that's
hard for anyone to understand, and the massive subsidies that cloud
economic decisions; all of this slows what you could otherwise
achieve.
   It's an economic Rubik's cone _ it defies solution. To make the
transition to a productive economy will test your mettle as a
people. The prices of some commodities may rise, some inefficient
businesses and factories will close.
   But the Hungarian government is increasingly leaving the business
of running the shops to the shopkeepers, the farms to the farmers,
and the creative drive of the people, once unleashed, will create
momentum of its own.
   And this will bring you a greater treasure than simply the riches
you create, it will give each of you control over your own destiny _
a Hungarian destiny. And as I said, the United States will be your
partner in this transformation to a successful economy.

   Some National Rifle Association members are
signing petitions to oust President Bush from the organization
because of his decision to ban imports of semiautomatic assault
rifles.
   But the White House says Bush, who last Friday permanently banned
imports of 43 styles of the weapons, has no intention of resigning
his lifetime NRA membership.
   ``The president's a good, solid member of the NRA, always has
been, always will be,'' spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Tuesday.
``We've done nothing that goes against the Second Amendment,'' which
ensures the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.
   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for
Legislative Action, said ``a lot of people are very upset about
this'' because many voted for Bush because of his opposition to gun
control laws.
   ``President Bush ran on a `no more federal gun control' pledge,''
LaPierre said. ``People believed that when they heard candidate Bush
say that. The pledge couldn't have been any clearer.''
   The petition drive ``is not something the organization is
undertaking,'' said LaPierre. But, he said, ``The sentiment is
certainly understandable ... There is an awful lot of
disillusionment around the country.''
   Anthony J. Hilder, a radio talk-show host in Anchorage who is
spearheading the petition drive in Alaska, said he gathered 400
signatures over the weekend at a gun show there.
   Similar petition drives are under way in 22 other states and the
District of Columbia, Hilder said.
   Bush took office maintaining there was no need for more gun
control. But he began to reassess that view following a public
outcry over the increasing popularity of high-powered assault
weapons among drug dealers and the slaying of five children in a
Stockton, Calif., schoolyard in January by a man wielding an AK-47.
   First lady Barbara Bush was among those saying such guns should
be banned.
   The Bush administration Friday banned imports of 43 styles of
semiautomatic assault-style weapons, including the popular
Chinese-made AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi carbine.
   U.S.-made weapons are not affected, but Bush called in May for a
magazine limit of 15 rounds, even more stringent than the 20 rounds
sought in a bill pushed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that also
would ban many domestic weapons.
   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the permanent import ban on
the 43 styles was required because the weapons did not meet the
standards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968. That law bars
importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting
purposes.
   LaPierre said it takes only one complaint by one NRA member that
another member has violated the organization's bylaws to get a
person considered for suspension or expulsion from the NRA. One
bylaw requires that members protect and defend the Constitution, in
particular the Second Amendment.
   A single NRA member can call for the expulsion of another member
by alleging a violation of NRA bylaws. The group's ethics committee
considers complaints.
   If the committee recommends suspension or expulsion, the member
is given 30 days to request a hearing. After a hearing, the
committee's final recommendation is considered by the 75-member NRA
board.

<HEAD>Hajj Rituals Proceed After Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Moslems from
80 countries today prayed on Mount Arafat as part of the annual
pilgrimage to Islam's holiest city.
   Police, meanwhile, searched for terrorists responsible for two
explosions Monday that killed one person and wounded 16 in Mecca.
   King Fahd arrived at sunrise today to supervise the pilgrimage,
or hajj, in the wake of the explosions. Fahd, whose official title
is custodian of the holy shrines, has been assuring Arab and Islamic
leaders that the kingdom will ensure the sanctity of the holy sites
and the safety of the pilgrims.
   Security sources said a number of suspects in the bombings have
been arrested for interrogation. The king said there would be ``no
mercy'' to the perpetrators. Saudi papers charged that Iran was
behind the bombings.
   The blasts occurred near the Grand Mosque. Moslems around the
world turn their faces toward the draped edifice in prayer five
times a day.
   In 110-degree heat, the throngs today shouted ``Labaika Allahumah
Labaika!'' or ``We respond to your summons, O Lord!''
   The state radio and television broadcast the rituals to scores of
Moslem countries via satellite.
   The hajj culminates at dawn Thursday, when Hajjis slit the
throats of sheep and start the three-day Eid al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice. This commemorates prophet Abraham's readiness to
sacrifice his son Ismail at God's behest.
   By official Saudi count, 774,560 pilgrims from 80 countries came
from overseas for this year's hajj. They were joined by 500,000
others from within Saudi Arabia. In addition, an estimated 600,000
Saudis converged on Mecca and Medina to provide services and
facilities.
   A previously unknown organization calling itself ``the Angry Arab
Generation'' claimed responsibility for the blasts Monday. But the
claim, made in Beirut, was all but ignored.
   Iran condemned the blasts and blamed them on the United States
and Saudi Arabia. The Iranians have called for the removal of the
Saudi rulers because of the restrictions on the number of pilgrims.
   The hajj has been turbulent since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
gained power in Iran in February 1979. Religious extremists seized
the Grand Mosque in Mecca that year and held it for two weeks.
   Saudi forces stormed the mosque and more than 250 people were
killed, including 100 extremists. Saudi authorities later beheaded
63 more.
   In 1986, the Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards who posed as pilgrims and tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.
   In 1987, Iranian pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca and clashed with
riot police, and 402 pilgrims died.
   Saudi Arabia broke its diplomatic ties with Tehran in April 1988.

<HEAD>BUDAPEST, Hungary: successful economy.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Last Thursday at the White House, I invited leaders from
business, education and labor and other fields, to come to the White
House and discuss the new private sector opportunities opening up in
Hungary. And their response was enthusiastic.
   This was especially true of Hungarian Americans, so proud to be
building a bridge between their new country and their mother land.
As long as our two governments ease the way, the people of America
and Hungary can do the rest. The people can do the rest.
   And it is in this spirit that I want to announce the following
measures:
   _First, as I said in Warsaw, I will propose at the Paris Economic
Summit concerted Western action for Poland and Hungary, to back your
reforms with economic and technical assistance from the summit
partners. Of course, our efforts for Hungary will be targeted to
your needs.
   _And second, I will ask the United States Congress to authorize a
$25 million fund as a source of new capital to invigorate the
Hungarian private sector. I'll also encourage parallel efforts from
the other nations of the economic summit.
   _And third, once your parliament passes the new emigration
legislation proposed by your council of ministers, I will inform our
Congress that Hungary is in full compliance with the Jackson-Vanik
Amendments to our 1974 trade law.
   No country has yet been released from the restrictions of this
amendment, so I am pleased to tell you that Hungary will be the
first. And this action will give Hungary the most liberal access to
the American market for the longest terms possible under our laws.
   _Fourth, America is prepared to provide your country with access
to our Generalized System of Preferences, which offers selective
tariff relief.
   Simply put, these last two measures will allow you to take
advantage of the largest single market in the entire world.
   _And fifth, we've concluded a draft agreement to authorize the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation _ OPIC, we call it _ to
operate in Hungary. And once our Senate passes the enabling
legislation, OPIC will be able to provide insurance to encourage
American investment in private enterprises in Hungary. Through OPIC,
American business executives will see firsthand the great
opportunity of Hungary.
   Private investment is critical for Hungary. It means jobs,
innovation, progress, but most of all private investment means a
brighter future for your children, a brighter future for Hungary.
   And yet, economic progress cannot be at the expense of the air we
breathe and the water we drink. Six weeks ago in Mainz, I proposed
cooperation between East and West on environmental issues.
   And that is why I will ask the United States Congress to
appropriate $5 million to establish an international environmental
center for Central and Eastern Europe to be based right here in
Budapest, which will bring together private and government experts
and organizations to address the ecological crisis.
   After all, our shared heritage is the earth, and the fate of the
earth transcends borders. It isn't just an East-West issue. Hungary
has led Eastern and Central Europe in addressing the concerns of
your citizens for cleaner air and water, and now you can do even
more, working with the West to build a bridge of technical and
scientific cooperation.
   Along these lines, I'm also pleased to announce that the United
States has proposed an agreement between our two countries to
establish scientific and technical cooperation in the basic sciences
and in specific areas, including the environment, medicine and
nuclear safety.
   It is my hope that this visit will also lead to a wider exchange
between East and West, so our scientists, our artists and our
environmentalists can learn from one another, so that our soldiers
and statesmen can discuss peace, and our students _ God bless them _
can discuss the future.
   But, to discuss anything requires a common language. The teaching
of the English language is one of the most popular American exports.
And as students, you know that English is the lingua franca of world
business, the key to clinching deals from Hong Kong to Toronto.
   So to open the global market to more Hungarians, I am pleased to
announce that the Peace Corps will, for the first time, operate in a
European country. And, our Peace Corps instructors will come to
Budapest and all 19 counties to teach English.
   And in such exchanges, we want to help you in your quest for a
new beginning as a democratic Hungary. So, the United States is also
committing more than $6 million to cultural and educational
opportunities in Eastern Europe.
   We will make available funds for a series of major, new
U.S.-Hungarian exchange programs among congressmen and legislative
experts; among labor and business leaders; among legal experts;
among community leaders; educators; and young people.
   We are creating dozens of fellowships to enable Hungarians to
study at American universities, and we will fund endowed chairs in
American studies at your universities, and books, many thousands of
them, to fill the shelves of your new International Management
Center, and the libraries of schools and universities across Hungary.
   And the United States will also open, within the next several
years, an American house in the center of Budapest. Today, the
celebrated American architect, Robert Stern, is releasing his design
for this center, which will be an open house of books, magazines,
and videocassettes, an open house of ideas.
   And so in conclusion, in economic reform and democratic change,
in cultural and environmental cooperation there are great
opportunities and great challenges.
   Hungary has a lot of work ahead, and so do the United States and
Hungary, working together to build this better future, a dynamic
future.
   Your challenge is enormous and historic: to build a structure of
political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the ruins
of a failed Stalinist system. And given the opportunity to show your
characteristic initiative, creativity and resourcefulness, I believe
that the Hungarian people will meet the challenge.
   You stand on the threshold of a new era of economic development
and yes, political change. And I believe with all my heart that you
are ready to meet the future.
   I see a country well on the way. I see a country rich in human
resources, rich in the moral courage of its people. I see a nation
transcending its past and reaching out to its destiny.
   I congratulate you for having come so far. And let us be equal to
the opportunity that lies before us. Let us have history write of us
that we were the generation that made Europe whole and free.
   Thank you all. God bless each and every one of you. Thank you
very much.

   Iran's government-run insurance companies
have established a special death or injury policy for the throng
expected around Ayatollah Ruhalloh Khomeini's tomb to mark the 40th
day since his death.
   Millions are expected at Tehran's Beheshte Zahra cemetery
Thursday to mark the day, the end of the period of mourning in the
Shiite Moslem faith.
   Khomeini, the architect of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, died
June 3 of a heart attack at age 86. At least eight people were
killed and thousands collapsed from exhaustion in the mayhem of his
funeral when millions packed Tehran's streets.
   Frenzied mourners grabbed Khomeini's coffin as it was being
readied for the burial and tore apart his white shroud. The coffin
was recovered by Revolutionary Guards and eventually lowered by
helicopter to the graveside at the Beheshte Zahra cemetery.
   The Islamic Association of Insurance Companies, the umbrella
organization for Iran's nationalized insurance companies, announced
that the special policy will pay $13,500 in case of death or serious
injury and medical expenses up to $2,000, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said today.
   IRNA quoted the minister of the construction crusade, Gholamreza
Foruzesh, as saying about 7,000 workers had been preparing the site
for the past month for Thursday's ceremony.
   Seifollah Vahis Dastjerdi, secretary-general of the Iranian Red
Crescent Society, said medical facilities for Thursday included
1,500 physicians, nurses and relief workers, two helicopters, 250
ambulances and 29 mobile medical centers.
   IRNA said 45 tons of foodstuffs were being shipped in for the
day. The government has distributed free food at the site since
Khomeini was buried.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, also said that the Islamic complex to
be built around the tomb will be able to house up to 150,000
visitors when it is finished within the next five years.

<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
apologized today for comparing Poles to children in a candy store
who can't say no.
   ``I apologize for the metaphor but I think the point was
correct,'' he told a press briefing here, the second stop on
President Bush's 10-day European tour.
   Sununu made his original comment Monday in an NBC-TV interview
when he said Bush would not ``thrust a huge amount of money on the
table'' to help Poland with its staggering economic problems.
   Explaining why substantial funds would be inappropriate, Sununu
replied, ``Well, the analogue ... that's almost appropriate is, you
can't create the problem of a young person in the candy store, where
there is some much there that they don't know which direction to
take and don't have the self-discipline to take the right steps.''
   Asked today about the remark, the chief of staff said he was
trying to make the point that money given to Poland in the 1970s was
misspent and didn't really help that country.
   ``They acknowledge that the utilization of those funds did not
always focus on the most critical needs that Poland had.
   ``The metaphor may have been bad and I apologize for the
metaphor,'' Sununu said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Pays $2.77 Million Libel Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has paid a $2.77
million libel judgment awarded to a lawyer who was the subject of a
1979 story over a will he prepared.
   It was the largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper and
the second-largest judgment upheld by U.S. courts, according to the
Post-Gazette. The largest was a $3 million libel award last year
against CBS News.
   But the newspaper's editor, John G. Craig Jr., said today that he
believes the libel decision is ``a particular Pennsylvania problem''
and won't have nationwide repercussions.
   A Westmoreland County jury ruled in 1985 that the newspaper
libeled Richard DiSalle, a former state and appellate judge, of
Washington County. The payment was for $2 million in punitive
damages, $210,000 in actual damages and interest accumulated since
the verdict.
   The payment check was signed Tuesday by officers of PG Publishing
Co., the newspaper's parent firm. It was paid to DiSalle; his wife,
Joan; and Daniel Berger, the attorney who represented them in the
case.
   At issue was a Sept. 10, 1979, article about the disputed will of
millionaire Paul Ciaffoni. The article contained allegations made in
court documents by some relatives that the will was fraudulently
altered and that DiSalle had a close relationship with the
co-executor, Ciaffoni's youngest daughter.
   The judge instructed the jury that under state libel law
publications about judicial proceedings are immune from legal
responsibility even if they contain information that defames an
individual. The judge said, however, that newspapers give up that
immunity if an article is not a fair summary of those court
proceedings.
   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.
   ``I just don't see the decision on neutral reporting privilege
becoming nationwide because it's a very peculiar decision,'' Craig
said. ``But I think in Pennsylvania, until it's overturned, which
I'm sure it will be, it will cause newspapers a lot of trouble.''
   ``You just cannot be involved in a situation like this and not
have a profound effect on you,'' Craig said. ``What it does is bring
home for you the risk involved in the kind of business we're in, and
so you have really a dual responsibility. One is to be conscious of
the risks and execute your business with a great deal of precision
and care. Concurrently, however, you cannot spend your life looking
over your shoulder because people pay you to tell them what's going
on. Part of that is reporting on public life. That's what happened
in this instance.''
   The Post-Gazette is suing one of its insurance carriers, National
Surety Corp., which has refused to pay the $2 million punitive
damages in the case.
   In a lawsuit filed in May, the newspaper argued that its primary
insurance carrier had agreed to pay $1 million to cover the award
and attorneys fees. The lawsuit charged that National, which
provides excess insurance coverage, is refusing to pay.
   The insurance company argued that Pennsylvania law did not permit
insurance carriers to pay punitive damages in the lawsuit.

   Bundles of cocaine continue to wash
ashore on Texas beaches, including a $2.5 million package found near
here, and the Coast Guard warned beachcombers to watch what they
inhale when they take in the air.
   ``If anybody finds any of it, I hope nobody opens the package,''
said Petty Officer James Gutknecht at the Coast Guard's Port
O'Connor station. ``This cocaine is pretty potent stuff.''
   At least nine packages have been found on a 225-mile stretch of
beach between Galveston and Port Aransas since a fisherman found an
11-pound bundle on Matagorda Island on June 30, officials said.
   Officials have said a smuggling ship may have gone down in the
Gulf of Mexico during Tropical Storm Allison three weeks ago,
dumping the contraband into the sea.
   ``We've had seven in the Port O'Connor area,'' Gutknecht said.
``They all weighed about one kilo each.''
   A Coast Guard boat found a 2.2-pound package valued at $100,000
on Tuesday near Matagorda Peninsula. Guard boats are patrolling the
area around Port O'Connor in hopes of intercepting any more bundles,
Gutknecht said.
   The largest find to date was a 55-pound package worth $2.5
million that was discovered Monday evening by a man walking along
Crystal Beach near Galveston, U.S. Customs spokesman Cliff Wolfe
said.
   Galveston County Sheriff Joe Max Taylor said they are the first
instances of cocaine washing up on beaches although bales of
marijuana have washed ashore in the past.

<HEAD>Secret Service Officer Accepted Watch From Spence, Reports Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to show that Washington Times first reported
officer receiving gift watch last week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Secret Service officer at the White House has
told investigators he accepted an $8,000 wristwatch from a
Washington lobbyist who had asked him to intervene when the lobbyist
was arrested for driving while intoxicated, according to published
reports.
   The lobbyist, Craig J. Spence, is the target of a federal
investigation of his relationship with federal employees, including
the uniformed Secret Service officer.
   The probe is tied to an investigation of possible credit card
fraud by an alleged homosexual prostitution service broken up by
local and federal agents in February.
   Last week, The Washington Times reported that Spence, who the
newspaper said was a client of the prostitution service, gave Secret
Service officer Ronald A. deGueldre an $8,000 gold Rolex wristwatch
in exchange for ``unspecified favors.''
   DeGueldre has acknowledged admitting Spence and several friends
to the White House for a special 11 p.m. tour on the weekend of
Independence Day in July 1988. ``I gave him the tour like I did my
family,'' deGueldre told The Associated Press on Monday.
   DeGueldre told the Times that he first met Spence when he was a
patrolman near foreign embassies where Spence lived. About five
years later, the officer said Spence called him to invite him to a
number of parties.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that deGueldre
also said Spence asked him to intervene with officials following
Spence's arrest on a charge of drunken driving.
   Spence was arrested Jan. 20, 1988 by the Secret Service for
drunken driving, according to court records.
   DeGueldre told the Post that after Spence called him in late
January 1988, deGueldre ``talked to my superiors and informed them
that this was a guy with a lot of clout. That's the last I ever
heard of it.''
   The District of Columbia Office of Corporation Counsel said
Tuesday the case was dropped on Feb. 5, 1988 because it was
``without merit,'' but would not give details, the Post reported.
   DeGueldre, reached Tuesday by The AP, refused to comment on
details of the driving case.
   DeGueldre also said he received the gold watch from Spence last
July. ``Spence said we should swap watches, and I gave him my $22
Casio and he gave me the $8,000 Rolex. It was a friendship thing,
not to do anything for him.''
   According to the Post, DeGueldre has denied allegations by a
Secret Service investigator that he admitted stealing several pieces
of the valuable Truman china collection from a pantry in the White
House living quarters and gave one piece to Spence and several to
members of deGueldre's family.
   The Secret Service said the officer admitted stealing two sets of
presidential cufflinks and tie tacks from the basement office of
Rose Zamaria, director of White House operations, the Post reported.
   DeGueldre denied committing any thefts or doing favors for
Spence, the Post said.

   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards has filed for
divorce from his wife of 40 years, saying they have reached an
amicable agreement to part after living apart for more than a year.
   Edwards, 61, filed the divorce petition and a concurring answer
from his 60-year-old wife, Elaine, in state District Court here
Tuesday.
   ``Elaine will remain in New York to pursue a career in television
and advertising,'' said a statement issued through Edwards'
secretary on behalf of the couple.
   ``I will remain in Louisiana to practice law and continue my
pursuit of political interest. We have always been good friends, we
are now and ever will be.''
   The petition says the couple separated in March 1988. It also
says they have reached agreement concerning community property and
that no legal proceedings are necessary to divide it.
   The two married on April 5, 1949. They have four children ranging
in age from 29 to 39.
   Edwards won two terms as governor in 1972 and 1976. He regained
the seat in 1984 and moved into the mansion alone while his wife
remained in their Baton Rouge house. He was defeated in the 1988
Democratic primary by now-Gov. Buddy Roemer.

<HEAD>Sudan and Rebels to Cooperate with U.N. Aid Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military rulers and rebels
fighting in the south have pledged to cooperate with U.N. efforts to
save 100,000 Sudanese threatened by famine and disease, the
operation's director says.
   James P. Grant, the U.N. secretary-general's special
representative for Operation Lifeline Sudan, spoke Tuesday at a
fund-raising conference where almost $10 million was raised toward
the $200-million relief effort.
   The operation is the first example of both sides involved in a
civil war providing safe passage so food and medicines can reach all
parts of the country, said Grant.
   Until this year, efforts in Sudan were hampered by the government
or guerrillas refusing to allow supplies into areas controlled by
the other side.
   However, Operation Lifeline needs another $40 million to extend
its work through November and guarantee food is distributed, Grant
told reporters.
   With that amount, Grant said, ``We are confident that last year's
disaster can be avoided. Operation Lifeline Sudan is on a successful
track.''
   The United Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year from
starvation due to flood, drought, and war-induced famine.
   Grant's project sought to get 120,000 tons of food into villages
before the monsoon isolates peasants. Over 85,000 tons has been
delivered.
   Monsoons that make roads and airstrips impassable have hit full
force, but Grant said he hopes relief workers have time to deliver
the rest of the supplies by Nile River barge, light planes and
trucks.
   Sudan's entire fleet of over 50 barges has been trapped in the
besieged government garrison in southern Malakal since early this
year.
   Frightened soldiers were holding the tugboats and barges in case
they needed to escape from the rebels, said Grant. The garrison now
has agreed to let Operation Lifeline have 18 barges and three
tugboats, he said. A trial delivery of supplies to Malakal would be
attempted today, said Grant.
   Relief officials had feared the June 30 coup would complicate
their campaign. But Grant said he met the coup leader, Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, and ``he took great pains to reaffirm the
support of the new government to continuing Operation Lifeline
Sudan.''
   El-Bashir has said one of the reasons he ousted Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian government is because it failed to stop
the war.
   A spokesman for the new government said today that Ethiopia's
President Mengistu Haile Mariam has agreed to mediate peace talks
with the rebels.
   Lt. Col. Mohammed el-Amin Khalifa, a member of Sudan's ruling
council, said Mengistu agreed after Khalifa carried a formal request
from el-Bashir.
   Mengistu's government backs the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army, which is fighting for more autonomy. The government controls
only the garrison towns in southern provinces of Sudan, the largest
African country that covers an area one-third the size of the
continental United States.
   Most southerners are Christians or animists who revolted against
attempts by the Moslem-dominated government to impose Islamic law on
the entire nation.

   President Bush, declaring that ``the
Iron Curtain has begun to part,'' promised today to give Hungary
unlimited access to American markets and said he would sent the
first Peace Corps volunteers ever dispatched to a communist nation.
   Warmly applauded by his audience at Karl Marx University, Bush
also offered a $25 million grant to spur this reform-minded East
Bloc nation's fledgling free-enterprise system.
   Saluting political and economic reforms here, Bush said there is
``no mistaking the fact that Hungary is at the threshold of great
and historic change.''
   The president said Hungary's enormous challenge is ``to build a
structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise
on the ruins of a failed Stalinist system.''
   Bush's speech, which was broadcast live on Hungarian television,
followed talks with Hungarian leaders who presented him with a
plaque containing barbed wire fencing torn down along the Austrian
border.
   In his speech, Bush noted that barbed wire separating Hungary and
Austria had been dismantled and stacked into bales earlier this year.
   ``For the first time, the Iron Curtain has begun to part, and
Hungary _ your great country _ is leading the way,'' Bush said,
standing against a backdrop of huge Hungarian and American flags.
   With those words, his audience of several hundred students and
professors burst into applause. They also gave him a standing
ovation at the end.
   Bush noted that the Soviet Union had withdrawn some troops from
Hungary, and assured Soviet leaders they have ``nothing to lose or
fear from peaceful change.''
   Said Bush: ``We can _ and I am determined that we will _ work
together to move beyond containment, beyond the Cold War.''
   Making the same offer he presented in Poland, the president
promised that the United States ``will be your partner'' as Hungary
tries to establish economic freedoms.
   ``I believe you are ready to meet the future,'' Bush said. ``I
see a country well on the way. I see a country rich in human
resources and rich in moral courage of its people. I see a nation
transcending its past and reaching out to its destiny.''
   Bush did not link the assistance with any demands for austerity,
as he did earlier this week during his visit to Warsaw, the first
stop on a 10-day European tour.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said that in his talks
with Hungarian leaders, Bush emphasized he would ``be thrilled'' if
Soviet troops withdrew from Hungary and the United States would be
able to remove its troops from Europe.
   However, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater played down
that remark, saying there were no strategic plans or political
maneuvering behind it and that it was simply a philosophical
statement by Bush.
   The president earlier had rankled Soviet leaders by saying he
would like to see all Red Army troops withdrawn from Poland, a
suggestion that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev dismissed as
``propaganda.''
   Fitzwater said Bush explained to Hungarian leaders today that ``I
simply made a philosophical comment about the troops that got
everybody upset.''
   Hungarian officials seemed satisfied with Bush's aid proposals.
   ``The Americans are not selling us the fish but the net,'' said
Tamas Beck, the foreign trade minister. ``We want to use other
peoples' experiences, but we don't want to copy the systems of
others,'' said Laszlo Kovacs, state secretary in the Foreign
Ministry.
   Kovacs said Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told Secretary of State
James A. Baker III in a separate meeting that Hungary would welcome
a delegation of economic experts from the seven-nation summit of
industrial democracies meeting in Paris this weekend to help promote
Hungary's industrial modernization. Bush flies to Paris from Hungary
on Thursday to attend the economic summit.
   Sununu explained that Hungary has taken many steps toward a
free-enterprise system and said they are ``quite justifiably proud.''
   The White House said the Peace Corps volunteers being sent here
will assist Hungarian efforts to develop and expand English-language
teaching. Russian-language training is no longer required in
schools, and Hungarian officials have expressed interest in
expanding the use of English here.
   In offering the Peace Corps volunteers, Bush said: ``The teaching
of English is one of the most popular American exports.''
   The volunteer teachers who come here will help ``open the global
market to more Hungarians,'' Bush said.
   Sununu said the Peace Corps program would be the first not only
in Europe, but anywhere in a communist nation.
   The United States announced plans this spring to send Peace Corps
volunteers to China, but in the wake of the unrest there Chinese
officials have delayed accepting the Americans.
   Bush said the $25 million grant that he will seek from Congress
would be used to create an enterprise fund to help Hungary expand
its private sector, which, although small, is the most extensive in
Eastern Europe.
   The program is identical in purpose to one Bush announced earlier
in Warsaw, but with only a quarter of the $100 million in
development funds designated for Poland.
   Sununu explained that Hungary has a population of only 10 million
people, compared with 37 million in Poland. He said the gift to
Budapest was roughly proportional.
   Among other steps, Bush said he will ask Congress for $5 million
to establish a regional environmental center in Budapest for
cooperative research among government and outside experts dealing
with nuclear safety and energy issues.
   In promising to eliminate trade barriers against Hungary, Bush
said he planned to grant this country a permanent status as most
favored nation, accorded to America's trade friends. The only
requirement is for Hungary to formally enact its new emigration law,
removing all obstacles to emigration.
   It is expected to be passed by the end of the year, making
Hungary the first Warsaw Pact country deemed in full compliance with
the Jackson-Vanik law imposing trade barriers in retaliation for
emigration restrictions.
   Earlier, Bush met in the sprawling parliament building on the
banks of the Danube River with Communist Party general secretary
Karoly Grosz, government leader Rezso Nyers and Premier Miklos
Nemeth.
   The Hungarian leaders gave the president and Baker brass cases
containing barbed wire cut from the Iron Curtain that has been
dismantled along Hungary's border with Austria.
   An inscription read in part, ``It's believed that the artificial
and spiritual walls still existing in the world shall collapse
someday everywhere.''
   Bush thanked Nemeth and said, ``That is just beautiful. That's a
marvelous symbol of this whole visit.''
   Bush's speech was another step in his delicate campaign during
his 10-day European tour to encourage democratic freedoms in
communist lands without antagonizing the Soviet Union.
   Sununu said in a television interview with Cable News Network
that he did not think the Soviets were taking offense at Bush's
visits to Poland and Hungary, preceding the allied economic summit.
   ``I think it is clear ... that the Soviet Union recognizes that
the efforts the president is taking are designed to stabilize,
rather than destabilize,'' he said, ``and I think that it is not
only being well received here but around the world.''
   Besides the dismantling of the Iron Curtain on the Austrian
border, the Soviet Union has withdrawn thousands of troops and tanks
in recent months from Hungary, where Red Army troops crushed a
democratic uprising in 1956.
   Hungary has been at the forefront of economic reforms in the
communist bloc since the 1960s, encouraging private entrepreneurs
and boasting an energetic stock market with about 150 listings.
   Consumer goods are plentiful but expensive. On the other hand,
Hungary's nearly $18 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita
in Eastern Europe.

   President Bush pulled out a wad of
Hungarian money and did his bit for free enterprise today in a
bustling produce market.
   Bush, after his speech at Karl Marx University, went shopping at
the market on nearby Dimitrov Square, the same one where British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher purchased garlic and peppers on a
1983 visit.
   Bush had sweeter fare in mind: a dozen ripe peaches that cost 18
Hungarian forints a kilo, or about 14 cents a pound.
   That was cheap for the president of the United States, but close
to an hour's wage for the average Hungarian.
   ``I recommend these to you,'' he told reporters who trailed him
through the crowd of shoppers and vendors.
   An ebullient Bush shook hands and signed autographs for the
crowd, and blew kisses with his hand.
   He was greeted with applause wherever he went in the ornate,
wrought iron market, built late in the 19th century, where vendors
sell succulent heaps of fruit, vegetables, meat and other produce
from Hungary's rich farming land.
   Most of the produce comes from small private plots.
   Earlier, before going to the university, Bush met for half an
hour with 13 students from all over Hungary. Five were members of
FIDESZ, an outspoken youth group formed last year as a rival to the
official communist youth league, which has since disintegrated.
   Bush gave two of the students a ride in his limousine to the
university.

   At this week's Paris summit of major industrialized
nations, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno will pledge nearly $40 billion
in new debt relief and environmental aid for developing nations,
government officials said today.
   Uno left for Paris today accompanied by his wife Chiyo, Finance
Minister Tatsuo Murayama and Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.
   During the three-day summit, which opens Friday, Uno will
announce an increase of $35 billion in Japan's ``recycling of
funds'' program for the developing world until 1991, a Foreign
Ministry official said.
   The term ``recycling of funds'' refers to the overall plan by the
Japanese government to use capital derived from its large trade
surplus as aid to help developing countries.
   The $35 billion is in addition to $30 billion Japan already has
allocated to the developing world for 1987-89.
   It also includes an additional $10 billion to be provided over a
three-year period through a ``parallel lending facility'' set up by
the Japan Export-Import Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
said the official, who requested anonymity.
   Projects to be funded remain to be decided, but aid is expected
to go to African nations, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and
Venezuela, said another ministry official, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   An additional $2.25 billion will be set aside for projects
tackling environmental problems, the Foreign Ministry official said.
Another $600 million will be provided in grants to the poorest of
the developing nations, mostly in Africa, he said.
   The money comes from the Japan Overseas Cooperation Fund, a
central government organization; the Export-Import Bank, which
supplies money from the government and private sector, and
international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, whose funding comes from private firms and
governments.
   Japan has not said how much money will come from private firms
and how much from the government.
   Before attending the annual summit, Uno is scheduled to meet with
other summit participants from Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West
Germany and the United States, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   He will also meet with two female heads of government _
Philippine President Corazon Aquino and Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto. A Foreign Ministry spokesman this week denied that
Uno's meetings with them were scheduled to demonstrate he still has
credibility with women.
   Uno has been besieged politically at home in the wake of a
sex-for-money scandal including allegations he maintained sexual
relations with geishas for more than a decade.
   On Thursday, Uno will attend events celebrating the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution in Paris and grand opening of
the new Bastille Opera House.
   Uno is scheduled to return to Japan on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A 70-year-old woman spent five days in an
airport after she was separated from her family as a result of a
series of misunderstandings, police said.
   Initially, it was feared the woman might have been left behind by
relatives, but that turned out not to be the case, police said
Tuesday.
   Irene Rodriguez wandered around Los Angeles International Airport
after she went there July 5 to board a flight to Lincoln, Neb., and
found there was no ticket waiting for her. Finally, she asked
airport officials for help.
   Police began a criminal investigation, believing that pages in
the woman's address book were torn out, that her bank account had
been cleaned out and because officers were unable to locate her
children.
   But her son, Robin Breadwell, 39, and his 47-year-old wife,
Emily, 47, reported his mother missing when they arrived in Lincoln
after driving there. Their trip was delayed by vehicle troubles,
said police Detective Mel Arnold.
   ``It was just a tragic incident, probably a communications gap,''
Arnold said. ``It all worked out OK, I guess.''
   Ms. Rodriguez was undernourished and dehydrated after her ordeal.
She was hospitalized Sunday after finally seeking help and was
listed in good condition today at the Medical Center in Tarzana.
   Breadwell told authorities he reserved a ticket for his mother
July 3, but apparently his credit card purchase had not cleared in
time for the ticket to be issued, Arnold said.
   Ms. Rodriguez said she ate in airport cafeterias until her pocket
money ran out and slept in seats in the airport waiting areas. A
carry-on bag was reportedly stolen during her ordeal.
   Arnold did not explain why authorities initially believed the
woman's address book had been tampered with or whether Breadwell was
authorized to close his mother's bank account.
   The Breadwells reportedly were moving her furniture to Nebraska
overland after buying her a home in Lincoln so that she could be
closer to them.

   Police today dismantled a small explosive found
under the car of Tel Aviv's mayor while it was parked outside his
home.
   Mayor Shlomo Lahat said people who oppose plans to demolish an
illegally built home and close an unlicensed business may have been
responsible.
   But police spokeswoman Etti Greenberg said the motive was not
known. She described the explosive as ``small'' and refused to
elaborate.
   Israeli radio stations quoted witnesses as saying it looked like
a small gas tank rigged with a few wires.
   Ms. Greenberg said the bomb was spotted by a neighbor early today
beneath the mayor's car in north Tel Aviv. Police are investigating
in all directions to determine who is responsible,'' Ms. Greenberg
said by telephone.
   Lahat, 62, told army radio he believed the assailants were trying
to warn him not to close an unlicensed business or raze an illegally
built house. He did not specify which business or home he was
referring to.
   ``It is what you may call a warning. Not for something done but a
decision that is supposed to be taken. That is my feeling,'' Lahat
said. ``Whoever thinks they will deter me from my job is mistaken.''
   Tel Aviv, on the Mediterranean coast, is the country's economic
and social center. It is home to 350,000 Israelis, including 7,500
Arab citizens.

<HEAD>Current Likeness of Mandela Distributed by Trade Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade unions today distributed
hundreds of posters bearing a likeness of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, defying a law banning reproduction of
prisoners' pictures.
   Mandela, who has been in prison since 1962, is serving a life
term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government.
   After his imprisonment, no pictures of him were published in
South Africa until a small photograph appeared in a government
handbook three years ago. Several newspapers later published that
picture.
   However, the photograph showed Mandela at age 45. He will be 71
next week.
   Last year, according to sources, an artist was commissioned to
produce a current likeness of Mandela and did so from descriptions
of the few people who have been allowed to visit him in prison.
   A color drawing was printed on a poster and distributed today at
the opening of the annual meeting of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions.
   It was described by those who have seen Mandela as ``a very good
likeness,'' and ``fairly accurate.''
   The posters, bearing the words ``Release Mandela and All
Political Prisoners,'' were also taped to the walls and windows of
the convention center south of Johannesburg, where the conference is
being held.
   No police were visible at the conference, and no attempt was made
to remove the posters.
   The poster and the drawing of Mandela bear no artist or printing
company credit. Neither officials of the labor congress nor their
attorneys would discuss the origin of the picture.
   Although no legal photograph has been taken of Mandela since
1962, a picture of him was taken surreptitiously in 1966 at Robben
Island prison.
   Mandela met July 5 with President P.W. Botha. The talks at
Botha's official residence fueled speculation that Mandela may soon
be released.

   A convenience store clerk was on
the telephone winning a radio station contest early today when she
let out a squeal.
   The disc jockey at WPOW-FM thought it was a squeal of delight,
but an armed robber had just walked into the Circle K store where
Lizzie Trumble worked.
   ``She said, `Oh, my God. Call the police.' She gave the address
and hung up,'' said overnight disc jockey Dimas Martinez. ``I knew
who it was already. She's a chronic winner.''
   He called police shortly after 4 a.m., and officers responded
within minutes. No arrest was reported by late morning. The robber
made off with the contents of the cash register.
   ``Both she and her husband called us back later to thank us for
helping them out. We put out the description of the assailant and
that's the last we heard of it,'' said WPOW news director Jim Reihle.
   Coincidentally, Trumble's husband also won a morning-show contest
today.
   ``It was crazy because I've been in the business 20 years, and
I've never seen anything like this happen,'' Reihle said.

   Syrian and Christian gunners battled with
howitzers in mountains southeast of Beirut today, and 10 people were
reported wounded.
   The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 405 people
killed and 1,593 wounded since the confrontation began March 8.
   The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which has close ties to Syria,
said the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, was planning
``a major escalation of the confrontation in the next few days with
the aim of achieving a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on
Lebanon.''
   The conservative daily paper Ad-Diyar quoted an unidentified
``senior source'' in Christian east Beirut as predicting a ``major
escalation of hostilities'' by the weekend if a three-member Arab
League committee failed to persuade Syria to lift its naval blockade
of Christian ports.
   As-Safir, quoting unidentified Western sources, said France and
Iraq support Aoun's plan to seek a settlement to the
Syrian-Christian confrontation at the United Nations.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has declared support for Aoun's
``war of liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops deployed in
Lebanon.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders have accused the Syrians of
failing to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation
Arab League by siding with Moslems against the Christians in the
14-year civil war.
   Syria and its local Moslem and leftist militia allies have
accused Aoun of blocking Arab League peace efforts. An aide to Aoun,
speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that.
   Syrian gunboats have blockaded the 28-mile Christian-controlled
stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peace Corps' new program in Hungary will
involve about 60 American volunteers going there to train Hungarians
in the teaching of English, agency officials said today.
   President Bush announced the program _ marking the first Peace
Corps effort in a communist country _ during his visit to Hungary.
   In offering the corps volunteers, Bush said in Budapest: ``The
teaching of English is one of the most popular American exports.''
He said the program will help ``open the global market to more
Hungarians.''
   At a news conference here following Bush's announcement, Peace
Corps Director Paul D. Coverdell declared that ``this is a historic
day and the threshold of a new era for the United States Peace
Corps.''
   ``When volunteers enter Hungary, it will be the 100th nation in
which we have served,'' he said. ``It will also be the first
European and first Eastern bloc nation in which the Peace Corps has
served.''
   Coverdell said that while more than 121,000 U.S. volunteers have
served in 99 developing countries over the last 28 years, ``the
program in Hungary shows that the underlying mission of peace has no
political or national boundaries.''
   ``President Bush today told the Hungarians that to succeed in
reforms you need partners _ not just governments, but people. The
United States Peace Corps is proud to provide some of those
partners,'' he said.
   Coverdell said details of the program still need to be worked out
through talks with Hungarian officials.
   Asked about the number of American volunteers that will be
involved, he said that ``ultimately we believe the number will
approach 60 volunteers in 1990, which is a very substantial
program.''
   Coverdell said that eventually the hope is to place volunteers in
all 19 counties of Hungary and the federal district of Budapest.
   The emphasis will be on training Hungarian classroom teachers to
teach English as a second language to their own people.
Russian-language training is no longer required in Hungarian
schools, and Hungarian officials have expressed interest in
expanding the use of English.
   The United States announced plans this spring to send Peace Corps
volunteers to China, but in the wake of the unrest there Chinese
officials have delayed accepting the Americans.
   Coverdell told reporters that Beijing officials had said they
wanted a ``postponement'' and further talks about implementing the
program in China.
   ``We are prepared to enter into those discussions on whatever
timetable they choose,'' the Peace Corps chief said.

<TEXT>
   The government today closed the
nation's six universities and sent in security forces to search the
campuses in a crackdown on Sinhalese militants.
   The universities are believed to be bases for left-wing
extremists of the anti-government People's Liberation Front.
   Colleges reopened May 10 after being closed for two years in an
effort to curb student unrest and violent anti-government
demonstrations.
   A Defense Ministry statement said, ``The security forces were
compelled to order the closure of universities as a temporary
measure.''
   ``The security forces in a preliminary search have already found
large quantities of explosives, weaponry, subversive literature and
posters intimidating the public,'' the statement said.
   It said the universities will be closed until security forces
complete their search and ``isolate the disruptive elements.''
   Four of the universities are in the island's central and southern
districts, the stronghold of the People's Liberation Front. The
other two are in the northeast.
   The radicals launched a violent, anti-government campaign two
years ago to protest peace overtures to Tamil rebels fighting for an
independent nation.
   The government blames the radicals for more than 3,500 political
killings since then. The extremists allege too many concessions were
given to the minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the
population.
   Tamils have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983,
alleging discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and control the
government and military.

<HEAD>Cheney Says No Magic Formula to Eliminate Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says he has no
magic formula to eliminate fraud and waste from Pentagon purchasing,
but he believes his new reorganization plan can save taxpayers at
least $30 billion by 1993.
   Cheney's plan, unveiled Tuesday, includes proposals to reduce the
number of individuals involved in purchasing decisions by the
thousands and to limit the authority of individual military services
to complete deals.
   Still, Cheney told reporters, ``there's no silver bullet here.''
   ``We have a blueprint that we plan to pursue ... to try to
significantly improve the way we do business,'' he said. ``If we're
going to be successful, it will be because we got Congress to
cooperate.''
   Cheney acted immediately to reorganize his top-level management
team, but other parts of his plan will need congressional approval.
His report was requested by President Bush five months ago in
response to weapons procurement scandals that have rocked the
Pentagon in the last two years.
   Federal prosecutors' ``Ill Wind'' investigation has focused on
bribery by consultants who sought inside information for their
clients on pending military contracts.
   Cheney said central to his plan is giving the undersecretary of
defense increased authority over purchasing decisions by the
individual services. He said he intends to eliminate several layers
of top management to establish a ``clear chain of command'' on such
decisions.
   Members of defense-related committees in Congress gave Cheney's
proposal cautious support. Sen. Jeff Bingham, D-N.M., called the
report ``a good start,'' while Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said it is
bound to improve on the ``absolutely inefficient'' purchasing system
of the past.

<TEXT>
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party made a strong showing in Michoacan state elections, according
to results announced today. News reports said the opposition may ask
for a new election because of alleged fraud.
   The governing party, PRI, conceded defeat in the Baja California
gubernatorial race, its first such loss since the party was founded
60 years ago.
   It won 12 seats in the Michoacan state assembly, compared to six
for the main opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, said
the official Notimex news agency.
   Although PRI fell one short of a majority, the outcome was seen
as a victory for a party that last year lost all but one of the
Michoacan congressional seats in the national elections.
   There are 24 seats in the assembly, six of which are assigned to
minority parties who failed to win any of the 18 races.
   Notimex said PRD leaders may ask for new elections because of
alleged irregularities in the July 2 balloting and the count.
   PRD repeatedly said the PRI was cheating in Michoacan, and PRD
supporters picketed or staged sit-ins in many districts to monitor
the vote count.
   In the northwestern border state of Baja California, official
results had yet to be announced in two of 15 contested legislative
districts and the governorship.
   PRI officials were treating the party's defeats almost as
victories, saying they demonstrated the sincerity of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's promise to clean up Mexico's elections
and modernize its politics.
   ``The winds of change and democratic transformation that are
sweeping the world have arrived, without doubt, in Mexico,'' said
the PRI's national chairman, Donald Colosio.
   The defeats are ``a reality that all the sectors of the PRI
accept because, above everything, the commitment is to democracy,''
PRI Sen. Maximiliano Silerio Esparza said.
   PRI conceded the governorship to the National Action Party, or
PAN. Of legislative seats that have been decided, PAN holds seven
and PRI holds six.
   The PAN candidate, Ernesto Ruffo, is the first non-PRI candidate
to win a governorship since PRI was founded. PRI has never lost a
presidential election and suffered its first Senate defeats in last
year's general election.
   Four more seats will be awarded to minority parties by proportion
of the statewide votes.
   The state electoral commission has declared PAN candidates the
victors in mayoral races in Tijuana and Ensenada, while a PRI
candidate was the winner in Tecate.
   In Mexicali, Baja California's capital, PRI claimed victory and
PAN conceded defeat.
   PAN, which ran its first gubernatorial candidate in Baja
California in 1959, is Mexico's oldest and best organized opposition
party.

   The French Appeals Court has refused to allow two
homosexual couples to enjoy the same rights as those given to
unmarried heterosexual couples living together.
   The judgment of the court, published Tuesday, invalidated the
decision of lower courts in the two cases. The decision cannot be
appealed further.
   In one case, an Air France flight attendant identified as Yves _
surnames were withheld _ demanded that his live-in companion, Serge,
be granted reduced fares and other benefits that Air France grants
to employees living with members of the opposite sex.
   In the second case, the mother of three children, Nadia, set up
house with her friend, Annie, and sought to obtain health insurance
for Annie from the Social Security administration. She was turned
down on the ground that French legislation concerning unmarried
cohabitation applies only to men and women.
   The Appeals Court, ruling simultaneously on both cases, said they
did not fall within the law of January 2, 1978, which defined the
legal meaning of unmarried cohabitation.
   This law, the Appeals Court ruled, concerned two people who have
decided to live together as man and wife without the benefit of
marriage and ``can therefore only concern a couple formed by a man
and a woman.''

<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Rex Humbard
testified today that he once hitched a ride on a private jet with
PTL executives, but did not know the trip was charged to David
Taggart's personal credit card.
   Humbard, a former PTL board member who has been a TV evangelist
for 36 years, said he did not know why Taggart charged the $3,899
flight, which included a $200 tip, on his personal card and then
sought reimbursement from PTL. The August 1985 flight was from
Charlotte to Florida.
   David Taggart and his brother, James, are charged with failing to
pay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to 1987. Federal prosecutors
say the brothers, both former PTL officials, diverted $1.1 million
of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on
PTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit
card bills.
   Humbard, who said his ministry staff includes 15 family members,
testified that he does not allow any expenditures over $10,000 that
have not been approved by the board of directors.
   ``It's quite regimented, isn't it sir?'' federal prosecutor David
Brown asked Humbard, whose ministry started in Akron, Ohio, and has
been headquartered in the resort town of Boca Raton, Fla., for thtside
the budget without
authorization from the board of directors.''
   On Tuesday, a former PTL financial officer testified that he did
not think he would get help from ministry founder Jim Bakker in
getting documentation explaining $200,000 in cash advances to David
Taggart.
   ``I had the distinct feeling I wouldn't get a lot of help,'' said
Peter Bailey, the ministry's former vice president for finance.
   Bailey said David Taggart refused to submit documentation for the
cash advances despite repeated requests.
   ``He assured me he had the documents or he was working on the
documentation,'' Bailey testified. ``David told me the receipts were
being maintained on the third floor (the ministry's executive
offices) for reasons of confidentiality.''
   Bailey said PTL eventually had to write off the $215,578 in
outstanding cash advances David Taggart had accumulated by November
1985.
   ``As vice president of finance at PTL, why did you not demand
that David Taggart turn over his receipts?'' Brown asked.
   ``We did the best we could. We tried to get the receipts on many
occasions. We just couldn't do it,'' Bailey responded.
   The brothers were indicted in December, the day that PTL founder
Bakker and his former top assistant Richard Dortch were indicted on
mail and wire fraud charges. Bakker and Dortch face trial Aug. 28.
   ``It was not uncommon for him to request a $10,000 cash
advance,'' Bailey said.
   ``How, without the documentation, would you substantiate that the
money was spent on PTL business?'' Brown asked.
   ``I had to take Mr. Taggart's word for it,'' Bailey responded.
``He was my boss and I had no choice. But I had no reason not to
believe him.''
   Bailey testified that the only control he had over Taggart's use
of ministry credit cards was the $100,000 credit limit imposed by
MasterCard and Visa.
   He also testified he once pledged a $75,000 certificate of
deposit owned by PTL as collateral for a loan Taggart needed to buy
a $640,000 apartment in New York's Trump Tower.
   But he said he did not recall signing a three-page statement for
a mortgage on the apartment that incorrectly said Taggart was
president of PTL and inflated his salary to $150,000 a year.
   Taggart at the time was a vice president for administration and
earned about $90,000, prosecutors said.
   Bailey also testified that three blank checks were issued to
David Taggart shortly before Bakker's resignation in March 1987. He
said the checks were used by the Taggarts to pay off their personal
American Express bills.
   One check totaled $50,000, followed by one for $45,000 and a
third for $30,000, Bailey testified.
   A fourth check _ for $15,000 _ was written to American Express
about three weeks before Bakker's resignation, he said.
   The trial, which began last week, has outlined the expensive
shopping habits of the two brothers. Witnesses have testified that
besides the New York apartment the brothers owned a $330,000 home in
Charlotte and regularly purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of jewelry and designer clothes.
   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, each could be sentenced
to 25 years in prison and fined about $1 million.

   Lawmakers today warned Air Force officials that
the half-billion-dollar B-2 stealth bomber faces a tough uphill
fight in Congress despite the warplane's strategic importance.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, told Air Force officials at
the start of a hearing on the radar-evading plane.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Chief of Staff Gen. Larry
Welch, using a color-slide presentation, argued that the plane
outpaces improvements in Soviet air defenses and that failure to
build the bomber would undermine the nation's nuclear deterrent
force.
   The Air Force argument marked the second day in a row that
officials took their case to Congress. Rice and Welch made a similar
presentation to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
   At the start of today's hearing, Republicans as well as Democrats
served notice that the B-2 faces serious opposition in a
budget-minded Congress.
   ``The B-2 program is in a lot of trouble, a lot of difficulty.
It's not technical problems but the price tag,'' said Rep. William
Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
panel.
   The Air Force campaign comes amid growing opposition to the
bomber, which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive
aircraft in history at $500 million to $750 million a copy.
   Last month, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Senate Armed
Services panel, urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to suspend
production of the B-2 because the aircraft has not been tested in
flight.
   Glenn, a former astronaut and test pilot, said pursuing
production of the plane violates the rule of ``fly before buy.''
   Two weeks ago, a House amendment to the fiscal 1990 defense bill
proposing cancellation of the program failed, but the Armed Services
panel did approve cutting $500 million from the program's
procurement budget.
   Since then, the Pentagon announced late Friday the first flight
tests of the bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held
during the next two weeks. And on Monday the bomber moved under its
own power when it taxied along a Mojave Desert runway.
   This week, while the Senate committee votes on the military
budget and the House prepares to take up defense spending later this
month, Rice and Welch are presenting their case to lawmakers. Cheney
is scheduled to appear before the House panel on Thursday.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop Corp., in Palmdale, Calif.,
the plane will cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period
beginning in fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.
   One Republican member of the Senate Armed Services pane, said he
was not swayed by Tuesday's lobbying campaign.
   ``I have serious concerns about the aircraft,'' said Sen. John
McCain of Arizona. ``I may not go as far as Senator Glenn, but the
Air Force must prove this aircraft before full-scale production.''
   McCain said the service, with the runway test Monday and a maiden
flight in a few weeks, is ``conveying the appearance of only meeting
milestones in the face of congressional pressures.''
   Rice and Welch told senators the Pentagon estimates the Soviet
Union has spent more than $350 billion on air defense over a 20-year
period and plans to invest more money.
   ``That very expensive array of defenses is largely ineffective
against an aircraft with B-2 capabilities,'' the Air Force said in
an 18-page report.
   Although Rice and Welch met in closed session with the Senate
panel, the ranking members _ Democratic chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia
and Republican John Warner of Virginia _ released the Air Force
report.
   The Air Force also said the B-2 ``can make a powerful
contribution with its conventional capability.'' The plane can cover
all the world's land areas from any of three locations _ the
Whiteman base in Missouri, Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and Guam
_ with a single air refueling.
   The Air Force said, a small force of B-2s could have had the same
success that two carrier battle groups and about 120 aircraft had in
the 1986 raid on Libya.

   Dozens of stunned homeowners were homeles after rare tornadoes in
the Northeast destroyed their property, and hundreds cut up fallen
trees and installed new windows. Thousands of homes remained without
power today
   Monday's violent storms cut a swath of destruction from northern
New Jersey to central Massachusetts. The tornadoes were blamed for
the death of a 12-year-old girl in Connecticut who was camping when
a tree fell on her tent, and for injuries suffered by hundreds.
   At least 50 homes and 40 businesses were demolished in one
Connecticut community, while 24 condominium apartments in a New York
town were shattered.
   A heat wave in the Midwest, meanwhile, brought temperatures in
the 90s for the second day Tuesday, but a ``cooling center'' was
largely ignored in St. Louis, where a second heat-related death was
reported this week.
   Thunderstorms chased the heat in northern Illinois, but lightning
struck three people, injuring two critically. The storms also
spawned tornadoes near Kankakee, Ill., and at Indianapolis and
Fairland, Ind., where twisters damaged an apartment complex, the
National Weather Service said. No injuries were reported.
   A storm also closed Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for 40
minutes Tuesday afternoon. Flight operations were back to normal
Tuesday night.
   Gusts of 75 mph blew a DC-3 airplane into a hanger at Fort Wayne,
Ind., the weather service said.
   Today, water stood up to 3 feet deep in sections of Kansas after
heavy rain fell during the night, the weather service said. Parts of
eastern Kansas got over 3 inches of rain, and 6 inches fell at
McFarland, and Emporia had water standing 3 feet deep on low-lying
sections of some roads, it said.
   Locally heavy rain also fell on sections of southern Nebraska and
southern Iowa, with 3.15 inches in two hours at Ottumwa, Iowa.
   In the Northeast, the weather service was waiting to investigate
the destruction before confirming that tornadoes hit the region, but
Fort Lee, N.J., police Capt. Thomas Pierson had no doubts.
   ``When something like that comes through, I call it a tornado,
even without Dorothy and Toto,'' he said. Damage to 18 New Jersey
communities was estimated at $2 million.
   In Connecticut, the damage was far worse _ estimated in the tens
of millions of dollars.
   Gov. William A. O'Neill viewed the destruction by helicopter and
car. He declared a state of emergency Tuesday and asked President
Bush for federal assistance.
   Hamden, Conn., was hardest-hit.
   Earthmovers roared into the city to clear a path through fallen
trees and utility poles in a 30-square-block area. The governor's
motorcade weaved through the streets to avoid the debris.
   ``It looks like a war zone,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,
D-Conn., who toured the area with O'Neill. ``It looks like a street
in London during the blitz.''
   Police using dogs to sniff through demolished buildings in
Hamden, which is about 30 miles south of Hartford, found seven
people trapped in three collapsed buildings, said Public Safety
Commissioner Lester J. Forst. He said they were taken from the
buildings unhurt. State health officials said about 250 people
suffered minor injuries.
   ``It becomes more and more of a miracle that more people weren't
injured or even killed,'' O'Neill said.
   Mayor John Carusone estimated damage at $50 million.
   He said at least 50 homes and at least 40 businesses were
demolished or so heavily damaged they must be torn down.
   More than 36,000 utility customers in the state remained without
power today. Northeast Utilities said all but about 5,000 customers
would have power by midnight tonight, and United Illuminating said
service would be restored to most customers today.
   In Waterbury and Hamden, some looting was reported. State
troopers and National Guardsmen patrolled Hamden's streets.
   Damage in Bantam, a section of the town of Litchfield, covered a
square mile, officials said. Among the buildings destroyed were an
historic church, the post office, the only service station and the
borough meeting house.
   In New York, Putnam County Executive Peter Alexanderson declared
a state of emergency for the county. He estimated damage at $20
million.
   At one condominium complex in Carmel, about 50 miles north of New
York City, officials determined that 24 apartments would have to be
torn down and 36 repaired.
   When it started to rain Monday night, Ellen Wheat called in her
cats.
   ``I tried to shut the door; I couldn't do it,'' she said. ``I
heard noises and I looked where the staircase was. The roof was
gone.''
   The cats were still missing Tuesday, and her second-floor
bedrooms have no roof or front wall.

   A man claiming to be an FBI agent
called state police this morning to ask for backup, then shot the
two troopers who were sent to help him, police said.
   Trooper Noel Sanchez, 30, was hit in the neck but was expected to
recover, said state police Maj. Carl Colberg. Trooper Christopher
Elg was grazed on the forehead, treated and released.
   The gunman got away and police in cruisers and helicopters were
searching in New York and New Jersey. The shooting occurred on the
grounds of the Ford Products Co. in Valley Cottage, about seven
miles from the New Jersey border.
   Colberg said a man called the West Nyack station of the state
police early this morning, saying he was an FBI agent doing
surveillance at Ford Products.
   The man requested ``a state police patrol to assist him in case
he needed a uniformed presence,'' Colberg said.
   The troopers met a man at Ford Products who ``was dressed in a
manner that indicated he was a police person. He apparently was
wearing a bulletproof vest and spoke in police jargon,'' Colberg
said. The man spoke with the troopers, then pulled a gun believed to
be a semi-automatic and fired at them.
   Elg was treated at Nyack Hospital and released, according to
hospital spokeswoman Nancy Kriz.
   Sanchez was transferred from Nyack Hospital to the Westchester
County Medical Center in Valhalla. His wound is not considered
life-threatening, Colberg said.
   Elg has been a trooper since 1985; Sanchez since 1983.

<HEAD>Kemp Says HUD Problems Should Not Give Private Enterprise a Bad Name</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 4 grafs new with Kemp testimony; editing throughout to conform.</HEAD>

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said today problems
in the scandal-plagued department he took over this year should not
be allowed to ``give private enterprise a bad name.''
   The government stands to lose an estimated $2 billion from
several abused programs in the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which is under investigation by Congress, the Justice
Department and the agency's own inspector general.
   ``I don't want the problems we are confronting to give private
enterprise a bad name,'' Kemp told the House Banking, Finance and
Urban Affairs Committee.
   The department is under investigation for influence peddling, in
which well-known Republicans or former HUD employees in private
business used their connections to get government funds for specific
housing projects.
   During his testimony Tuesday before the House Government
Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, Kemp agreed that
$2 billion was a valid estimate for potential losses to the
government. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., based his estimate on
potential losses from bad loans, inflated costs passed along to the
government and outright theft that has occurred at HUD.
   ``It's a ballpark figure,'' Kemp said. ``I think $6 billion would
be too high, $1 billion would be too low.''
   ``We are getting a handle on this,'' Kemp said Tuesday. ``We have
stopped the hemorrhaging.''
   Late Tuesday, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., introduced a bill that
he said could save HUD some $390 million by having the agency
refinance subsidized mortgages to get lower interest rates.
   Kemp made clear he held his predecessors responsible for the mess
he found, although he did not mention former Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce Jr. or former President Ronald Reagan by name.
   ``Frankly, any administration has to be held accountable and is
accountable to the American people and to the pages of the history
books for how programs are run during their stewardship,'' Kemp
said. ``I think that speaks volumes about previous administrations _
plural.''
   The Justice Department is investigating the theft of as much as
$20 million by private closing agents who sold HUD property and kept
the money, and other investigations are focusing on loan programs in
which questionable deals were made leading to high default rates.
   Kemp, who was a congressman from New York before being appointed
HUD secretary by President Bush, got a warm reception from his
former House colleagues, who were just as eager to praise his
efforts to clean up the department as they were to blame his
predecessors for fouling it up.
   As they groped for ways to express themselves, the metaphors got
thick.
   Lantos referred to Kemp's former career in the American Football
League, calling him the ``quarterback'' at HUD who has been
``blitzed'' by the scandals but nevertheless is not one to ``punt.''
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., called HUD ``Humpty Dumpty,''
although she said she thought it could be put back together again.
   Schumer called HUD a ``swamp'' and housing in the United States a
``desert,'' then praised Kemp for fixing the ``leaky hose'' at the
department.
   Kemp, who first called HUD a swamp a few months ago, had enough.
``I'm sorry the swamp thing ever got used,'' he said.

   In a drive to reach an early agreement,
the NATO allies will present to the Warsaw Pact on Thursday their
proposal for reducing non-nuclear forces in Europe, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III announced today.
   This is nearly two months ahead of schedule and improves
prospects for completing an accord within a year, Baker told
reporters traveling with President Bush here.
   ``By tabling this proposal, we are taking a step toward ending
the military division of Europe,'' Baker said at a news conference.
   Baker praised the Soviets for accepting a U.S. proposal to
conduct trial monitoring of nuclear missile systems before signing a
strategic weapons treaty.
   ``We think it is very good that the Soviets have responded
positively,'' Baker said.
   Despite complaints by American anlysts outside the government
that it was a stalling tactic, Baker said trial monitoring ``might
move arms control forward instead of retarding it.''
   The negotiations to cut long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines are being held in Geneva. The talks to reduce troops and
other non-nuclear forces are scheduled to recess on Thursday in
Vienna.
   The next round is scheduled for Sept. 5.
   Putting NATO's proposal on the table before the recess gives the
Soviets and their allies nearly two months to frame a response.
   Baker announced, meanwhile, that NATO would propose a ceiling of
5,700 combat aircraft for each alliance and 1,900 combat helicopters.
   The decision to make the proposal on Thursday was reached by a a
panel of senior NATO officials in Brussels last Friday, a U.S.
official said.
   Bush first unveiled at the NATO summit in May his blueprint for
deep reductions in conventional arms and troops in Europe by the
superpowers. It was subsequently endorsed by the full NATO alliance.

   Roman Catholic Archbishop Stephen
Naidoo was buried Wednesday following a funeral Mass that drew more
than 7,000 mourners.
   The 51-year-old leader of the Cape Town Archdiocese died of a
heart attack July 1 at his brother's home in London.
   Naidoo was interred in St. Mary's Cathedral at a private ceremony
after the Mass, attended by Desmond Tutu, the Anglican Archbishop of
Cape Town, and other South African church leaders, as well as Roman
Catholic bishops from Lesotho and Zimbabwe.
   Durban Archbishop Denis Hurley recalled Naidoo as a ``gentle,
kindly, articulate and considerate person'' who stood for justice
and peace. He said Naidoo would be remembered for his participation
in a clergyman's march on Parliament in February 1988, when he was
arrested for the first time in his life, along with Tutu and others.
   Naidoo also played a prominent role in negotiating the release of
hunger-stiking detainees earlier this year, and was a major force in
organizing the visit of Pope John Paul II to southern Africa in
September.

   China wooed 400 foreign travel agents Wednesday
with wine and words of friendship as it tried to persuade them to
bring back lucrative tours that were canceled when martial law was
imposed in Beijing.
   ``The Chinese people will not forget those friends who help us in
difficulty,'' Bo Xicheng, director of the Beijing Tourism
Administration, declared at the start of a two-day seminar.
   The travel agents were reassured by the calm on the streets, but
said the immediate outlook is poor.
   ``These soldiers have their fingers on the triggers,'' Gloria
Copeland of Trinity Travel in Toronto said of troops standing guard
on city streets. ``They're going to have to sling (the guns) behind
their backs before tourists come back.''
   ``People in America take one good vacation a year ... and this
year they're going to Europe,'' said Joe Openshaw of Sunco Travel in
Walnut Creek, Calif. He said lifting martial law ``would help''
China's prospects.
   Bo said, however, that ``we're not going to lift martial law just
because a few tourists won't come to China.''
   Authorities have refused to say how long martial law will last,
keeping an estimated 150,000 soldiers on the streets and in barracks
on the capital's outskirts.
   Tourists and foreign residents fled by the thousands when China's
army fought its way into Beijing on June 3-4, firing on student
pro-democracy protesters and bystanders.
   Luxury hotels emptied except for staff, and gift shop clerks
napped behind their counters as China's tourism industry, which made
$2.2 billion last year, faced major losses.
   Two weeks ago, Bo's office sent invitations to foreign tour
agents it knew, invited them to bring others, then flew them for
free and put them up in luxury hotels in a last-ditch effort to save
the season.
   Zhou Dayan, a spokeswoman for the tourism administration, said
the conference's mission was urgent. ``Maybe in the second half of
the year we can draw some tourists,'' she said.
   Bo recounted the government's explanation that the army crackdown
was necessary, but his main theme was the money being lost on both
sides.
   ``Perhaps we have different views and understandings of some
problems, but this does not prevent us from doing business on an
equal and mutually beneficial basis,'' he told the agents before
they were taken to Tiananmen Square, formerly the heart of the
protests.
   That trip may have backfired, as the travel agents noticed
lingering evidence of the violence that accompanied the crackdown.
   ``I saw the scars on the concrete from the tank tracks and it
reminded me of what I'd seen on television a month ago. Frankly, it
was depressing,'' said an American who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Not all responses were negative. Several agents said they had
canceled June and July tours but planned to send groups in August
and September despite continued warnings from foreign governments,
including the United States, against travel to China.
   ``I think the situation may be better than most of us thought it
would be,'' Ms. Copeland said. ``The airport was fine, the hotel was
fine. The only problem we had was when we were on the street and saw
the soldiers and wondered if we would be stopped.''
   She said ``diehard types'' likely will visit this year, ``but
that's not the bulk of the tourists. Many are middle-America types
and they need a bit more time. They will come back, but they're
probably going to say, `Do it next year.'''

<TEXT>
   Police raided Shanghai bars last week in a
crackdown on prostitution in the city's night spots, newspapers
reported.
   Shanghai recently established a Cultural Management Bureau to
oversee the city's ``flourishing cultural market'' of bars, discos,
tea houses, orchestras, art groups and fashion shows, the Guangming
Daily reported Wednesday.
   Regulations imposed by the bureau include a relicensing of all
bands, and a ban on bar girls.
   Before the communists came into power in 1949, the port city was
famous for its nightlife, which in recent years began to flourish
again.
   Shanghai's Liberation Daily, in its Tuesday editions, said
Shanghai has 667 dance halls, tea houses and Japanese-style bars,
288 bands, 1,500 musicians and 450 singers.
   During a three-day investigation last week, authorities visited
87 bars in four districts, closed five of them, suspended the
license of two and arrested 22 bar girls, Shanghai's Wen Hui Bao
reported Sunday.
   The Liberation Daily, another Shanghai newspaper, gave a detailed
account of the midnight bar raid in its Tuesday editions.
   ``This was just a small shop ... with an aisle going down the
middle and dining car-type chairs on the sides .... Using the light
from the television, one could see three pretty and coquettishly
made up girls, one of whom was small and skinny and looked about 15
years old,'' the report said.
   The paper said the women called themselves bar girls, but
actually were prostitutes, and described the bar as a house of
prostitution.
   The crackdown is part of the state's effort to show authorities
rooting out corruption and ``bourgeois liberalization'' _ the
attraction to Western culture.
   Despite the reported Shanghai crackdown, bars in Beijing seem to
be operating as usual.

<HEAD>US Proposal May Speed Reduction in Farm Trade Barriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Wednesday that the United States has proposed a technical measure
designed to speed the reduction of barriers to trade in farm
products.
   Hills said the Bush administration wants other nations to convert
non-tariff import barriers, such as quotas and restrictive licenses,
to tariffs.
   ``By converting to tariffs, barriers would be more transparent
and uniform, making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions in
agriculture support and protection,'' she said in a statement.
   The proposal was made in Geneva in trade negotiations with 100
other nations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), which regulates world trade treaties and settles
commerce disputes. The current series of talks, known as the Uruguay
Round, began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year.
   In April, GATT negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks,
which had been deadlocked since December, reaching broad agreement
in four key areas, including a compromise on a U.S. demand to do
away with all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. The talks
since then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how to
achieve the goals of the larger compromise.
   Hills said the U.S. ``tarification'' proposal must be part of a
more comprehensive package including fundamental refors in domestic
farm subsidies, export subsidies and sanitary rules.

<HEAD>Haughey Forms New Government in Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Haughey today won the votes
necessary to form a coalition government after his long-dominant
Fianna Fail party failed to win a majority in national elections.
   The six votes of the Progressive Democratic Party members in the
Dail, Ireland's parliament, gave the 63-year-old Haughey the margin
he needed to head the government for the fourth time.
   Haughey did not immediately name his Cabinet, but it was
announced that two of the 15 ministers and one junior minister would
come from the Progressive Democrats.
   The party's leader, Desmond O'Malley, 50, is a former Fianna Fail
member who led two unsuccessful revolts against Haughey and was
expelled from the party in 1985. The other five Progressive
Democrats in the Dail also defected from Fianna Fail.
   With six members, down from 14 in the previous parliament, the
Progressive Democrats had lost their right to automatic places on
committees.
   Haughey called a national election June 15 in hopes of winning a
majority in the 166-seat Dail, but Fianna Fail wound up with just 77
seats.
   Haughey was forced to resign as prime minister last week after an
inconclusive vote in the Dail, but he remained as head of the
caretaker government.
   Fianna Fail, Gaelic for ``warriors of destiny,'' was formed from
the losing side in Ireland's civil war of 1922-23. Led by Eamon de
Valera, the party formed its first government in 1932 and has been
the top vote-getter since.
   Haughey, the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Sean Lemass, was
elected party leader and prime minister in 1979 in a government that
survived until 1981. He also led governments in 1982 and 1987-89.

   Kidnappers who abducted a wealthy landowner
Dec. 28 and cut off his ear to show they meant business freed him
Wednesday, police said.
   The family of Marzio Perrini reportedly paid a $1.5 million
ransom after the gang sent his ear to a Rome newspaper last week,
the ANSA news agency reported.
   Perrini, 64, was picked up by a squad car on a highway in
southern Italy about 1 a.m.
   Relatives said Perrini told them the abduction was a ``terrible
nightmare'' and that he was kept blindfolded and chained to a cot
for six months.
   Perrini was kidnapped from his estate near Brindisi.

   High infant mortality and dropout rates among
blacks are problems all America must work to overcome, Vice
President Dan Quayle told the NAACP convention today.
   Quayle spoke on the fourth day of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People's annual convention in Detroit.
   ``If President George Bush were in the country, you know he would
be speaking to you,'' Quayle said. Bush was in Hungary today as part
of his tour of Eastern Europe.
   Quayle said the Bush administration was committed to promoting
civil rights and the president had met several times with civil
rights leaders. He reviewed the history of the civil rights
movement, including the removal of government-sanctioned racial
segregation.
   ``Now, thanks to much of the work by the NAACP, these racial
barriers have been struck down. But as the slogan says, the struggle
continues,'' he said. ``Today, there is less bigotry than before,
but there is still bigotry _ and bigots.''
   Quayle cited statistics indicating the social and economic
disadvantage of blacks.
   ``Let us not forget that the black infant mortality rate is twice
as high as for whites,'' said Quayle, who also spoke of the
disproportionately high dropout rate among young blacks.
   ``These are not just black problems, these are America's
problems,'' Quayle said.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks, as he had done two days
before, for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp,
gave a warm introduction to a member of the Bush administration.
   ``When Vice President Quayle was a senator, he did vote to make
Martin Luther King Day a holiday,'' Hooks said. ``He was one of the
few Republicans who voted to override President Reagan's veto of
South African sanctions.''
   On Tuesday, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca and Hooks
announced the company was pledging to boost opportunities for
minorities and women in salaried positions.
   The ``fair share'' pledge commits the No. 3 automaker to doubling
the number of women and minorities in management roles to 20
percent, said Anthony St. John, Chrysler's vice president for human
resources.
   Chrysler became the nation's 62nd company and the last of the Big
Three automakers to join the program.
   Generally, companies signing the agreement make commitments to
expand access of blacks to entry- and mid-level jobs, increase the
number of black-owned suppliers and appoint blacks to boards of
directors.
   The program also calls on Chrysler to increase the number of
black-owned dealerships, which currently number 72 of about 5,300.
But Iacocca said increasing that would be more difficult than
putting more blacks in management ranks because ``you don't become
an entrepreneur just by raising you hand and saying, `I'd like to be
an entrepreneur.'''
   St. John also said the company expects to maintain its 23-percent
level of minority hourly workers during the next five years.
   Earlier Tuesday, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young told the conference
that blacks who want to help the inner cities should stop spending
money with retailers that move out to the suburbs.
   ``We have to learn to spend our money with our own, and in our
own city,'' he said.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard praised a speech Monday by Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp calling for major efforts to upgrade urban
neighborhoods, but said his words must be matched by action.
   ``I understand Secretary Kemp gave a stirring speech here, but
the key will be whether Jack can deliver the Reagan-Bush
administration behind what he wants to do,'' said Blanchard, a
Democrat.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Seeking Penry Retrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have decided to retry a
retarded man whose death sentence for a murder and rape was struck
down last month by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Without a retrial, the state would have to commute Johnny Penry's
sentence to life imprisonment.
   Penry, 33, was sentenced to death in 1980 for the slaying of
Pamela Carpenter, the 22-year-old sister of former Washington
Redskins kicker Mark Moseley.
   The sentence was vacated by the high court, which said jurors at
Penry's trial should have been instructed that his history of mental
impairment and child abuse might have warranted life in prison
instead.
   But the court disagreed with Penry's lawyers that it is
unconstitutional to execute the mentally retarded.
   Penry's IQ is estimated at between 50 and 60, and experts say he
has the reasoning ability of a 7-year-old.
   District Attorney Terry Brown said Tuesday he hopes to have the
case back in the courtroom by fall, although questions over the
location of the trial, the admission of a 10-year-old confession and
other issues could delay matters.
   Brown said he is convinced the verdict and sentence will be the
same as before.
   ``You're always concerned when you're dealing with this kind of
time lag. For instance, I know of at least two witnesses who have
died since, including one of the arresting officers and Penry's
mother,'' Brown said.
   ``But if I didn't think we'd be able to obtain a death penalty in
retrial, I wouldn't have decided to retry the case.''
   Curtis Mason, a Texas Department of Corrections staff attorney
who represented the former laborer in his Supreme Court appeal, said
Brown wants a retrial for political reasons.

   Officials declared a statewide drought
disaster in North Dakota today _ the first step in making farmers
eligible for federal assistance.
   ``The 1988 drought never really ended, although we had some
relief until just a few weeks ago,'' Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl said, in
announcing the disaster declaration for Gov. George Sinner, who is
out of the state.
   ``Now, we're back to a very serious situation,'' Omdahl said.
   Sinner and Omdahl said in a statement that they hoped the
declaration would also call attention to North Dakota's plight. A
North Dakota State University study estimates farmers could lose at
least $541 million in small grains and hay crops as a result of a
deepening drought.
   ``Congress is currently debating a 1989 drought relief package,
so we want to send them an appropriate message regarding our
needs,'' Omdahl said.
   In Washington, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., introduced a bill
Tuesday to add spring crops to a 1989 drought relief measure. Conrad
said a dozen counties in North Dakota already have suffered crop
losses ranging from 60 percent to 80 percent.

   A 58-year-old man who passed himself off as a
doctor had a string of wives and girlfriends across the United
States whom he bilked out of thousands of dollars, police said.
   William R. Dickens was arrested Monday in a downtown Chicago
motel after police collected evidence of at least two women he
married and abandoned, police said.
   He remained in custody today and faced outstanding warrants from
other states. No charges have been filed yet in Illinois, according
to Dan McCullough of the Cook County state's attorney's office.
   ``Apparently his charm worked on women across the country,'' said
Detective Henry Thomas. ``We've had reports of wives or girlfriends
in Texas, Louisiana, Connecticut and Utah, and I don't think they've
all surfaced yet.''
   The 5-foot-10 inch, 265-pound Dickens, who has a South Side
Chicago address, identified himself as Dr. Holis McPhail to many
women he dated or married, said Detective Mike Herbert.
   His alias was the name of an Ogden, Utah, woman Dickens had dated
before stealing her credit cards and disappearing, Herbert said.
   Police said they were tipped off by a Chicago woman who had been
planning to marry Dickens on July 29 in Palm Springs, Calif., but
the woman became suspicious and did some checking on him.
   She subsequently contacted police, and they learned he was wanted
in Louisiana and Texas for felony theft and parole and probation
violations, officials said.
   ``He wasn't the best-looking man you've ever seen,'' said the
woman, who was interviewed by the Chicago Tribune and identified
only as Antoinette, 35. ``He's a big guy. It wasn't that that
attracted me. It was his personality. It was like a dream.''
   Dickens often requested loans of $100 to $150 from Antoinette
because he said he was doing work on a government project and his
assets were put on hold by the Internal Revenue Service, she said.
Dickens allegedly duped another Chicago woman out of $20,000, Thomas
said.

<HEAD>Japanese Plan Big Increase in Aid for Environment, Developing Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno packs the promise of
billions of dollars for the environment and the world's poorest
nations as he prepares for this week's Paris summit of major
industrialized nations.
   At the summit that begins Friday, Uno will pledge to increase
Japan's ``recycling of funds'' program for debt-ridden countries by
$35 billion and extend the program until 1991, a Foreign Ministry
official said late Wednesday.
   The $35 billion is in addition to a three-year, $30 billion
program that Japan started in 1987.
   Japan, under international pressure to increase its Third World
aid, started the ``recycling of funds'' program in the summer of
1987 by offering $30 billion in public and private funds in loans to
developing countries.
   Officials from the Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry said the
new package also will include $5.5 billion for the Brady plan, a
program by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to help heavily
indebted countries reduce their debt burdens.
   It also includes $10 billion over a three-year period through a
``lending facility'' set up by the Japan Export-Import Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   Aid is expected to go to African nations, Brazil, Mexico, the
Philippines and Venezuela, said another Foreign Ministry official,
who also requested anonymity.
   Another $2.25 billion will be set aside for projects on
environmental problems, he said, adding that another $600 million
will be given in grants to the poorest of the world's developing
countries, mostly in Africa.
   Recycling of funds refers to the Japanese government's plan to
use part of its huge trade surplus as aid to developing countries.
According to the Finance Ministry, Japan's trade surplus in 1988 was
$77.39 billion, down from $79.71 billion in 1987.
   The aid comes from the national budget; the Japan Overseas
Cooperation Fund, a government organization; the Export-Import Bank,
which supplies money from both the government and the private
sector; and international institutes such as the IMF and World Bank,
whose funding also comes from private firms and governments.
   ``It is politically very important for Japanese leaders to make
it clear to the rest of the world its determination'' to increase
aid further, maintain economic growth without inflation, spur
domestic demand and open markets to foreign goods.
   Uno left for Paris on Wednesday, leaving a government shaken by
the Recruit influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular 3 percent sales
tax and questions about his personal conduct.
   Uno, the former foreign minister, on June 2 replaced Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned to take responsibility for
the scandal.
   He has been besieged politically at home in the wake of a
sex-for-money scandal including allegations he maintained sexual
relations with geishas for more than a decade. He has denied doing
anything immoral.
   On Thursday, Uno will attend events celebrating the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution in Paris and grand opening of
the new Bastille Opera House.
   He is to return to Japan on Tuesday, five days before national
elections for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.

   The mother a 6-week-old girl whose
smothered body was found in a garbage can pleaded innocent today to
murder in a case nearly identical to the death of the woman's older
child three years ago.
   Paula Sims, 30, was indicted Tuesday by a Madison County grand
jury that still was weighing whether to charge her husband, Robert
Sims, 37, in the slaying of their daughter, Heather, said State's
Attorney William Haine.
   Wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and shackles, Mrs. Sims entered
the courtroom of Judge Edward Ferguson to hear the charges against
her and have a written plea entered by attorney Donald Groshong.
   A formal arraignment probably will be scheduled for next week,
said the judge, who refused a motion that bond be set. Mrs. Sims is
being held in Madison County Jail.
   She faces the death penalty if convicted.
   Neither prosecutors nor Groshong made any statement in court
today.
   The nude body of Heather Sims was found May 3 in a trash can
across the Mississippi River from the family's Alton home, four days
after Mrs. Sims reported that a masked gunman had abducted the girl.
   It was an almost identical story she gave police three years
earlier when her first daughter, Loralei, disappeared 13 days after
her birth in 1986. Skeletal remains believed to be Loralei's were
found a few days later about 150 yards from the Simses' home in
rural Brighton in Jersey County.
   That death remains unsolved.
   Alton Detective Jody O'Guinn arrested Mrs. Sims at her parents'
home in Cottage Hills shortly after the indictment was returned and
led her away in handcuffs.
   The grand jury heard more than four hours of testimony from her
parents Tuesday before returning the indictment. They were ordered
to testify after being granted immunity.
   But the prosecutor said other evidence made the state's case.
``The physical evidence was very important,'' Haine said, but he did
not elaborate.
   Defense attorney Groshong refused to comment.
   But Herb Condray, Mrs. Sims' brother-in-law, said police are only
trying to save face by arresting her.
   ``I think the police have egg on their face so bad that they
would do anything,'' Condray said.
   The Simses also have a 17-month old son, Randy, who was placed
into the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services during the investigation of Heather's death.
   Before the indictment, Mrs. Sims had been charged in Jersey and
Madison counties with obstruction of justice and concealment of a
homicide in connection with her daughters' deaths.
   She was free on $350,000 bond on those charges.
   Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom said the investigation into
Loralei's death continues, but is difficult because the cause of
death was never established.
   The autopsy on Heather revealed she had been suffocated with a
hand over her mouth. The body had freezer burns, leading
investigators to conclude that she had been put in a freezer before
the body was dumped in the trash.
   Mrs. Sims was indicted on two counts of murdering Heather.
   The first count alleges that Mrs. Sims intended to kill the girl.
The second count alleges Mrs. Sims committed an act she knew had the
strong probability of ending in death or great bodily harm.

   Willie B., Zoo Atlanta's bachelor gorilla who
spent nearly all of his life alone in a cage, had his first outdoor
romp with his new female companions today but preferred chewing a
bamboo stalk to courtship.
   Zoo officials, who hope to breed Willie B., said they weren't
surprised that romance didn't bloom immediately.
   ``Whether he will reproduce is still an open question,'' said zoo
Director Terry Maple.
   Willie B. came bounding out into his new natural-style habitat at
about 9 a.m., but spent most of the next hour or so snacking or
mugging for a gaggle of photographers.
   ``Today is the first day in the rest of Willie B.'s life as a
social animal,'' Maple said.
   Sam Winslow, curator of mammals at the zoo, said the chances of
Willie B. mating ``are a long shot because he has been isolated in
captivity so long.''
   He said zoo officials around the world cooperate in keeping
breeding records and exchanging animals to keep an active gene pool
going among the captive population and to avoid inbreeding.
   He said it is most likely Willie B. would breed with the younger
of his two companions, Kinyani, age 6, who is just approaching
maturity. Willie B. is thought to be 31.
   He had been introduced to female gorillas gradually over recent
months and will be with them outdoors routinely from now on.
   Kinyani approached Willie B. briefly in their first few minutes
outside together but scampered off a few yards, which animal
behaviorists said is normal.
   The females are on loan from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research
Center of Emory University. Willie B. was caged from the time of his
capture as an infant until his new outdoor habitat was completed a
year ago.

   Reporters attending briefings at
Thailand's Government House have been told to tidy up or stay away.
   Jeans-clad journalists will no longer be welcome in Bangkok's
main government office, Deputy Government Spokesman Likit
Hongladarom said Wednesday.
   A shirt with a collar and tie, or a smart safari suit are now de
rigeuer for all those attending official press conferences, despite
Bangkok's stifling average daytime temperature of about 90 degrees,
he said.
   The order to smarten up was issued by Gen. Kamol Dabbaransi,
personal assistant to Thailand's Prime Minister Gen Chatichai
Choonhaven, Likit said.
   Some reporters chasing the latest hot news story complain that
briefings at Government House can be intolerably sweaty affairs as
the lofty, 19th century building lacks an efficient air conditioning
system.
   Likit said he sympathized with reporters, but they were complying
with the new rules, despite some complaints.
   ``This week everybody is looking very tidy,'' he said.
   Some Bangkok newspapers said that they would pay an allowance to
their reporters and photographers to cover the cost of new suits.

   The Peace Corps' precedent-setting effort in
Hungary will send about 60 American volunteers there to train
Hungarians to teach English, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   ``This is a historic day and the threshold of a new era for the
United States Peace Corps,'' said Paul D. Coverdell, director of the
agency.
   President Bush announced the initiative, the first Peace Corps
program in a communist country, during his visit to Hungary.
   ``The teaching of English is one of the most popular American
exports,'' Bush said in Budapest, adding that the program will help
``open the global market to more Hungarians.''
   Coverdell, speaking at a news conference here after Bush's
announcement, said Hungary will the 100th nation to be served by the
Peace Corps.
   ``It will also be the first European and first Eastern bloc
nation in which the Peace Corps has served,'' he said.
   The United States announced plans this spring to send Peace Corps
volunteers to China, but Chinese officials have delayed the program
in the wake of student unrest. Coverdell said the Chinese have said
they want to talk more about the program.
   ``We are prepared to enter into those discussions on whatever
timetable they choose,'' he said Wednesday.
   More than 121,000 volunteers have served in 99 developing
countries over the last 28 years, Coverdell said, adding that ``the
program in Hungary shows that the underlying mission of peace has no
political or national boundaries.''
   ``President Bush today told the Hungarians that to succeed in
reforms you need partners _ not just governments, but people,''
Coverdell said. ``The United States Peace Corps is proud to provide
some of those partners.''
   A formal agreement still needs to be worked out with Hungarian
officials, and an assessment team will determine the size and scope
of the initial program.
   The first Peace Corps volunteers may arrive in Hungary by late
fall for training before being assigned to teaching positions early
next year, Coverdell said. The number of volunteers could reach 60
by 1990, he said.
   The emphasis will be on training Hungarian teachers to teach
English as a second language. Russian-language training is no longer
required in Hungarian schools, and Hungarian officials have
expressed interest in expanding the use of English.
   Coverdell said he has had no discussions with officials of other
Soviet bloc countries about possible Peace Corps activities.
   ``We are responding here to a very specific request from
Hungary,'' he said.
   More than 6,000 Peace Corps volunteers work in 65 countries
around the world, providing assistance in agriculture, education,
health, natural resources conservation, business, skilled trades and
other areas.

   Without a hint of remorse, Jerry Adam
stepped into the pristine Hercules Glade Wilderness in the Mark
Twain National Forest and set a fire that blackened 1,000 acres.
   No one rushed to arrest him. No smokejumpers parachuted in to
fight the flames. Adam is a fire technician with the U.S. Forest
Service.
   ``We do prescribed burns in the glade areas to reduce the amount
of fuel that could lead to a major fire,'' said Forest Service
spokesman Dave Wester. ``In other cases it's done to provide a
certain kind of habitat for wildlife. We sometimes burn grazing land
if it is seeded with warm season grasses, since fire is part of the
management of those grasses. Occasionally we'll burn to prepare a
site for tree planting.''
   Prescribed burning was conducted this spring on about 6,000 acres
in the 1.5-million-acre Mark Twain National Forest in southern
Missouri, Wester said. The closely monitored burns are done just
before trees and grasses turn green.
   Camping, hiking and horseback riding are popular in the remote
region, classified by the government as having the cleanest air in
the state. The glades _ a unique combination of open grasslands
featuring prairie vegetation, shallow soil, rocky outcroppings,
steep hillsides and forested knobs _ are also prized for dogwood
blooms in the spring and outstanding fall foilage.
   Prescribed burning is necessary every three to five years in the
glades, Adam said.
   ``If it isn't done, you'll have a fuel buildup and the potential
for a catastrophic fire, which is what they had at Yellowstone last
year, in which almost all living trees are killed and the soil is
exposed and sterilized,'' he said.
   Fire also keeps the spread of trees in check and gets rid of dead
material that can choke young plants.
   Fire is also important to animals that live in the open glade
landscape.
   ``There's a couple of little critters that really depend on these
glades, such as the collared lizard and the roadrunner, which is
more common to the arid Southwest,'' Adam said. ``We have armadillos
here, too.''
   In Missouri, the rare Bachman sparrow nests only in the Hercules
Wilderness Glade.
   Ash from the fires also rejuvenates dozens of varieties of
wildflowers. ``Fire is just like giving them a shot of fertilizer,''
Adam said.
   Periodic fires once occurred naturally in the glades, started by
lightning or perhaps by Indians, Adam said. But when Europeans moved
in, they put out the natural fires and built roads, which acted as
firebreaks.
   It took a Forest Service crew, using torches dripping a
combination of diesel fuel and gasoline, just five hours on a cool
day in early April to burn the leafy groundcover off 1,000 acres in
the Hercules Glade Wilderness.
   Today, few signs remain of the fire. Dense, green prairie grasses
and wildflowers are abundant. The fire burned to a height of about
three or four feet, blackening the bark of tall, hardy oak and pine
trees but otherwise not harming them.
   Adam doubts that any animals died in the fire.
   ``A turtle will scoot under those leaves for safety and the fire
will run right over him,'' he said. ``As soon as the fire passes by
and cools down, you'll see all these little lizards come out of
their holes. Of course the bigger animals, like deer and turkey,
just move out.''

   Heavy rain overnight helped firefighters get the upper hand on a
wildfire that destroyed 37 homes in Boulder Canyon, Colo., the most
destructive of the many wildfires burning today in eight states.
   But fire bosses worried that storms in several of the burned
areas could also bring lightning and the potential for new blazes.
   Twenty fires were burning on more than 110,000 acres in eight
states _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New
Mexico, Nevada and Utah, according to the federal Boise Interagency
Fire Center in Idaho.
   Rain helped the 11,000 firefighters working on the lines, but
officials issued a ``red flag'' warning because of thunderstorms
that are expected to move from northern Arizona across Nevada, the
Sierra Nevada range of California, eastern Oregon, Idaho and Montana
in the next two days.
   Officials at the firefighting coordinating agency fear the storms
could add to the more than 70,000 lightning strikes recorded across
the West during the past week, mostly in the past two days.
   ``It's a mixed blessing ... the chance of rain versus the chance
of lightning,'' Jerry Larson, deputy Nebraska fire marshal, said
today.
   Half an inch of rain poured on the Boulder Canyon fire overnight,
helping about 180 firefighters get the 2,000-acre blaze 90 percent
contained, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Melissa Carlson in
Boulder.
   The fire, which broke out Sunday, razed 37 homes and damaged
numerous other structures on private property.
   More rain was expected today, and firefighters hoped to contain
the blaze inside a ring of bare earth this evening.
   Boulder County Sheriff Brad Leach said the blaze began with
``carelessly discarded'' smoking material near a trailer owned by
Mitch Steiner of Boulder, but that there was insufficient evidence
for charges.
   In an interview broadcast Tuesday on KCNC-TV in Denver, Steiner,
28, said he went to the trailer for a few minutes Sunday to pick up
tools, but said he was sure he hadn't smoked or dropped anything
burning.
   The federal firefighting center gave the Boulder Canyon Blaze the
highest priority because of the damage to property and the threat it
posed to inhabited areas.
   Residents were allowed back into the area, but the sheriff's
office was advising people against staying overnight.
   In Arizona, a firefighter was struck dead by lightning on Monday,
becoming the second fatality of the fire season. A firefighter in
California was killed by a falling tree on Sunday.
   Rain helped crews contain or control nearly all the fires that
burned 50,000 acres in southern Arizona. Officials also expected to
bring under control today a 1,700-acre blaze near the Grand Canyon's
North Rim tourist lodge, which had threatened a historic hunting
cabin used by President Theodore Roosevelt, said Wendell Peacock of
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
   Several other fires were burning out of control in central and
northern Arizona, including an 800-acre blaze that threatened the
Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to nesting bald
eagles, and a 500-acre fire in the Tonto National Forest.
   The nation's biggest fire was in northwestern Nebraska, where
planes dumped fire-retardant chemicals on a blaze that burned
between 50,000 and 100,000 acres on ranchland and in Fort Robinson
State Park, where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed.
   Firefighters used heavy equipment and shovels to dig a line of
bare earth around the burning area, said Larson, the deputy fire
marshal. The blaze was declared fully contained late this morning.
   ``The fire is now well within the established fire line. The
weather is cooperating, the winds have died down,'' Larson said.
   ``We are cautiously optimistic that the worst part of the fire is
over,'' Gov. Kay Orr said on a tour of the burned area Tuesday.
   Officials planned to open the park Friday. The fire was ignited
by lightning Saturday.
   Nine people have been treated at a hospital for minor injuries
since the blaze began, Larson said.
   Elsewhere:
   _ Good weather helped firefighters encircle two brush fires in
northern California that burned more than 8,000 acres, but tough
going was reported today in the battle against a blaze at Big Sur on
the coast. The Big Sur fire, believed to be arson, charred nearly
3,000 acres of growth, and firefighters hoped to contain it by 6
p.m. today, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Maeton Freel.
   _ At Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado, the U.S.
Forest Service decided today to reopen all but a few sections to the
public, said John Pasquantino, fire information officer. Five
lightning-caused fires Tuesday night were quickly quelled after
scorching 2,600 acres, and Indian cliff dwellings abandoned in the
13th Century were undamaged, he said.
   _ Crews contained a 1,000-acre brush fire in Utah that had
prompted the temporary shutdown of a 345,000-volt line relaying
electricity in the West. And nearly 400 firefighters finished a fire
line around a 15,500-acre fire west of the Colorado line.
   _ Authorities in Yellowstone National Park moved quickly to
extinguish a lightning-caused fire that burned a tenth of an acre
Monday. It was the first natural fire of the season to be snuffed
out following the suspension of the ``let burn'' policy, which was
criticized after last year's massive blazes.
   Elswhere in Wyoming, rehabilitation work began Tuesday in a
3,500-acre section of the Bridger-Teton National Forest scorched by
a blaze that was contained Monday. Full control was predicted for
Monday.

   Here is a state-by-state glance at details on fires in the West:
   _Arizona: About 50 fires have burned 63,000 acres of forest,
range and brush since last week from Grand Canyon to Mexico. Largest
fire had burned up to 14,650 acres along the New Mexico line but was
nearly contained Tuesday.
   _California: Two major brush fires in northern California were
declared contained Tuesday. An arson blaze continued in Big Sur.
They had charred 10,955 acres. In Southern California, the
4,600-acre Mount Laguna fire east of San Diego was 30 percent
contained and some residents were allowed to go back home.
   _Colorado: Higher humidity and lower temperatures helped
firefighters against three major fires that had burned more than
5,000 acres and destroyed 37 homes.
   _Idaho: A 250-acre blaze in Payette National Forest in
west-central Idaho was contained after charring mostly grass and
sagebrush.
   _Montana: A 300-acre blaze near Libby in northwestern Montana was
controlled. Fire started late last week by an untended campfire.
   _Oregon: Crews contained a blaze that charred almost 1,100 acres
on the edge of the Fremont National Forest, the last of the state's
three fires to be contained this week.
   _Nebraska: Firefighters today contained a blaze in the state's
northwest corner that burned between 50,000 and 100,000 acres. About
150 firefighters from about 20 volunteer fire departments, Forest
Service and National Guard fought the blaze.
   _New Mexico: A 10,000-acre fire in Gila National Forest 50 miles
from Silver City was contained late Monday. Two other fires burned
5,700 acres of brush in El Malpais National Monument.
   _Utah: Some firefighters were released after containing three
fires in the Ashley National Forest and a 15,500-acre fire 20 miles
west of the Utah-Colorado border.
   _Washington: Couple of very small lightning-caused fires burned
Tuesday in northeast Washington.
   _Wyoming: One fire burning Tuesday, in Bridger Teton National
Forest about 150 miles southeast of Yellowstone National Park,
charred 3,477 acres from July 4 until it was contained Monday.

   Increased concern about violent crime is
producing an unlikely congressional coalition behind a plan to add
100,000 officers to police forces across the country by trading
scholarships for service.
   The idea behind the Police Corps Act of 1989 is to boost the
strength of state and local police forces by up to 22 percent while
creating a new brand of college-educated officers to cope with
racial tensions, gang warfare and other special challenges.
   An unusual group of lawmakers has formed around the bill,
including Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Bob Dornan, R-Calif.
   The outspoken, liberal Frank is rarely on the same side of an
issue with Dornan, an equally combative conservative. ``People who
disagree on 90 percent of the issues agree on 10 percent,'' Frank
said Tuesday.
   Frank said he backs the measure because ``It's a good idea to
have college-educated people in law enforcement. We don't pay cops
enough and don't give people enough incentive to be cops.''
   Participating students would get federally guaranteed loans for
their education, then have up to $40,000 repaid by the government
once they complete four years in the state police or a local police
department in the sponsoring state.
   The idea was developed in part by Adam Walinsky, a New York City
lawyer and former chairman of the State Investigations Commission
there. After seven years of lobbying, he believes the time is ripe
for congressional action.
   This year's version was introduced today by Sens. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., and Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Sasser said at a news conference that he will also include
language in a District of Columbia spending bill creating a ``Police
Corps'' pilot program in the nation's capital. He said the Senate
Government Affairs Committee is scheduled to consider the bill later
this week.
   The test program would provide 50 students with scholarships in
exchange for commitments to serve in the city's police force for
four years.
   ``Washington, D.C., has become a paradigm of the nation's growing
problem with violent crime,'' Sasser said. ``It will provide a
rigorous test for the Police Corps concept.''
   While the government would pay for the scholarships, it would
still be up to municipalities to pay the salaries of the additional
officers. But Specter said the officers would be ``premium
applicants'' and would be cheaper than others to employ because they
would not likely participate in pension programs as early.
   Cost is one reason why the plan has taken since 1982 to gain
momentum on Capitol Hill.
   ``It's taken unbelievably long,'' Walinsky said. ``If we had been
able to add the number and quality of police officers that this
intended, we wouldn't be in quite the trouble we are today. But that
was then and this is now.''
   Backers point to already-stretched local law enforcement budgets,
and to statistics showing that the nation allocates to violent crime
just one-sixth of the police power compared with 30 years ago.
   ``We have an historic precedent,'' said Specter, the former
district attorney of Philadelphia. ``In times of national emergency,
the bulk of our military officers have been drawn not from the
career forces, but from the citizenry at large. They have been
volunteers, who after their tour of duty returned to their civilian
occupations.''
   Police officials acknowledge there may be concerns about elitism,
but the measure has gained the support of the National Association
of Police Organizations, which represents 90,000 rank-and-file
officers.
   ``If you look at the District of Columbia, for example, you know
there is a problem recruiting,'' said Jules Bernstein, the
organization's legislative counsel. ``The job of being a police
officer is extremely hazardous. We support the bill.''
   Don Cahill, legislative director of the national Fraternal Order
of Police, which also backs the bill, said the measure would
``really bring up the level of professionalism.
   ``The problem I do see is that it's going to cost a heck of a lot
of money,'' he said.
   Walinsky said the bill envisions adding 100,000 officers to the
480,000 on the job today. If each accepted the maximum of $40,000,
that would create a $4 billion price tag.
   The Justice Department has yet to take a position on the measure,
said spokesman David Runkel.
   Other Senate sponsors include Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the
former state attorney general; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.; Chris Dodd, D-Conn.; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; and Harry Reid,
D-Nev.

   They all represent the same state and
they're all members of the same legislature, but there's a big
difference between members of New Jersey's Senate and Assembly. It
has to do with their appetites.
   During two night-long sessions last month to produce a new
budget, the 80 members of the Assembly chowed down on takeout pizza
and meatball sandwiches.
   ``It cost $400.28 for the two nights,'' said Bradley Brewster,
executive director of the Assembly Republican majority. ``This is
standard fare for late nights. It was pretty austere.''
   Senators, however, were allowed $25 for dinner each day _ or a
maximum of $2,000 for the 40 lawmakers, said a Senate spokesman. The
bills are still coming in, but the senators apparently spent a
little less than their limit, he said.
   The senators also could have used one of several rooms reserved
at a Marriott hotel, although only one or two senators did, the
spokesman said.
   No rooms were set aside for Assembly members, said Majority
Leader Garabed Haytaian.
   ``We only called up and ordered pizzas,'' he said. ``We are not
the Senate.''

   The city failed to fix a leaky water main at a
city-owned building, so the city gave the city a warning and turned
off the water.
   ``Only in New York,'' moaned Raymond Pilarte, superintendent of
the building.
   Pilarte reported the leak to the city's Department of Housing
Preservation and Development in April.
   Calls went back and forth, but it wasn't fixed.
   On Friday, the city Bureau of Water Supply told Pilarte that
unless the owner repaired the leak by Monday, the water would be
turned off.
   ``They just came in and turned the water off,'' said Pilarte's
wife, Angelina.
   HPD spokeswoman Roz Post said a contractor had agreed to make an
emergency trip.
   ``With the thousands of repairs the city makes on its buildings,
things like this can unfortunately happen,'' Post said.

   A flock of ducks skipped town before they
could be evicted from the Wet 'n Wild amusement park for taking free
rides and begging for food.
   The ducks were known for crashing the Lazy River ride and the
water slides, riding along with paying guests.
   An eight-hour effort to capture the birds last week left would-be
captors with only one bird in hand while about 30 of the mallards
still enjoyed their freedom.
   A second roundup was planned Tuesday, but park officials sent
word that the ducks had checked out.
   ``It seems that all the commotion has frightened them away,''
said Carmen Shaw, an environmentalist who led the relocation attempt.
   General manager Richard Faber received hundreds of suggestions
for getting rid of the birds, several saying the ducks could be
moved if they were fed bread doused with liquor.
   ``That was a bit extreme,'' he said. ``We have some juvenile
ducks floating out there.''

<HEAD>White Writers Back Cultural Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent white South African writers
including novelist Andre Brink and poet Breyten Breytenbach met
guerrilla leaders and backed an academic and cultural boycott of
their nation, they said Wednesday.
   The writers announced their support following a four-day meeting
of 45 writers and guerrilla leaders of the African National Congress
at the northwestern Zimbabwe resort of Victoria Falls. ANC delegates
were led by sculptor Barbara Masikela, head of the movement's arts
and culture department.
   Writers said they support international isolation of the
government and called for ``the strengthening simultaneously of all
forms of progressive South African culture.''
   The United Nations keeps a blacklist to monitor its ban on
cultural and academic ties. Recently, for example, the musical group
the Commodores was persuaded to cancel a planned tour of South
Africa when it was threatened with a spot on the blacklist.
   The writers, mostly Afrikaans speakers, called for their language
to be freed from its ``racist connotations'' so that it could find
its place in the cultural identity of a united, non-racial
democratic South Africa.
   Afrikaans is a language derived from South Africa's Dutch
settlers. Dutch descendants dominate the government and, in the
past, enforced teaching of Afrikaans in black schools has led to
widespread unrest.
   The writers deplored ``the way in which our culture is
impovershed by our enforced separation.''
   ``It is not heroic to oppose apartheid. It is normal,'' their
statement said.
   The talks, which were organized by the Institute for a Democratic
Alternative In South Africa and ended Tuesday, were the latest in a
series of meetings between white opponents of the Pretoria
government and the ANC, which is outlawed in South Africa.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces battled with
howitzers around Beirut amid heightening tension over a Wednesday
report the Christians expect a new shipment of Frog-7 missiles.
   Police said 10 people were wounded in the duel between gunners
from the Syrian army and mainly Christian Lebanese Army across a
mountain range southeast of the capital.
   The wounded are four Christian soldiers, two Christian civilians
and four Moslem civilians, police said.
   Since the latest round of the civil war began March 8 over
Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun's blockade of illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias, 405 people have been killed and 1,593 have
been wounded.
   Smoke billowed from the wooded slopes overlooking Beirut as
shells thudded across the valleys Wednesday morning. A police
spokesman said they exploded at a rate of six a minute. The shelling
subsided into intermittent exchanges around noon.
   The barrage coincided with the arrival in Damascus of the
Moroccan, Algerian and Saudi foreign ministers to discuss a truce
with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   ``In spite of the difficulties, I still think that conditions are
appropriate for brotherly (Arab-sponsored) solutions,'' Moroccan
Foreign Minister Abdel Latif al-Filali said in Damascus.
   The three are on an Arab League mission to negotiate a settlement
to Lebanon's 14-year civil war by November. Lebanese media said
their efforts face failure.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency said they gave Assad letters
from King Hassan of Morocco, Algerian President Chedli Bendjedid and
Saudi King Fahd.
   A commentary by Radio Damascus reaffirmed Syria's committment to
the peace moves, saying ``extracting Lebanon from its crisis is a
national task'' in which the Arab League mission ``should persevere
and continue.''
   Syria considers Lebanon within its sphere of influence and has
40,000 troops stationed across the country under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Six Syrian gunboats are blockading a 28-mile
coastal stretch east of Beirut controlled by Christians.
   Beirut's conservative daily Ad-Diyar quoted unidentified
Christian sources as predicting a ``major escalation of
hostilities'' by the weekend if the Arab League envoys fail to
persuade Syria to lift the blockade.
   Ad-Diyar said Syria's navy is waiting to intercept ``a large
Iraqi ship carrying more than 15 Gazelle helicopter gunships, in
addition to air-to-surface missiles and bombs for Aoun's forces.''
   It said another Iraqi vessel is carrying Soviet-made Frog-7
surface-to-surface missiles for Aoun.
   Syria sent its navy to block the coast last week after it said
Aoun had received an undisclosed number of Frog-7 missiles and
demanded they be removed because they can hit Damascus.
   At least seven reportedly are deployed in the Christian enclave.
If fired from the easternmost flank of Christian-held mountains,
they could reach Damascus 40 miles away.
   Aoun refuses to say whether he has any of the missiles and
reportedly has threatened air strikes against the Syrian gunboats.
   On Tuesday, Aoun sent a lone jet fighter roaring low over Syrian
batteries in west Beirut. The aging warplane is one of Aoun's three
operational British-made Hawker Hunters that, with eight Gazelles,
make up his air force.
   As-Safir, a leftist daily newspaper close to the Syrian
government, said Aoun plans ``a major escalation of the
confrontation in the next few days with the aim of achieving a
meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Lebanon.''
   The paper quoted unidentified Western sources as saying France
and Iraq support Aoun's bid to force a discussion at the world body.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has declared support for Aoun's
``war of liberation'' to drive Syria out of Lebanon because its
troops have betrayed their mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   Syria and its local Moslem and leftist militia allies in Lebanon
command 80,000 troops that far outnumber Aoun's army of 20,000.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Marx University, where President
Bush on Wednesday praised Hungarian moves toward a free-market
economy, no longer requires that students read ``Das Kapital.''
Indeed, as Bush spoke, the statue of Marx was out of sight _ hidden
by a press platform.
   ``History has proved that a free-market economy provides a much
higher living standard,'' said Magdolna Sass, 24, one of the
thousands of Hungarians who reacted enthusiastically when Bush
proclaimed that the Iron Curtain is parting and that ``your great
country is leading the way.''
   At the rear of the glass-covered courtyard where Bush spoke was
the hall's life-size statue of a seated Marx. The brow was furrowed;
the eyes pressed deep in thought; the right hand reaching upward in
a type of clawing motion _ seemingly trying to keep its grasp on
this country of 10 million.
   But few saw the statue of the godfather of communism. Towering
over it was a press platform crowded with reporters and
photographers covering the first visit ever by an American president
to Hungary.
   Zsuzsanna Szabo, like Ms. Sass a recent graduate of the
university, said she found Bush's speech ``very important.''
   ``There certainly are steps that must be taken to improve our
economy,'' she told a reporter.
   Long rounds of applause greeted Bush, who was given an
enthusiastic standing ovation when he finished.
   At one point, the president praised Hungary's willingness to
break with the past and asked his audience:
   ``What better example of this could there be than one simple fact
_ Karl Marx University has dropped `Das Kapital' from its required
reading list?''
   The 19th-century German genius' monumental work, along with his
other writings, formed the basis for the Communist systems that have
spread around the globe.
   Yet, despite the students' growing interest in capitalist
proponents from Adam Smith onward, both graduates agree that Hungary
will not completely turn its back on Marx any time soon.
   ``That would only be possible when the old guard politicians die
off,'' Ms. Sass said.
   ``Everyone now says he's in favor of reforms,'' Ms. Szabo said of
the school's students. ``But I'd say only about 70 percent of them
really believe in a free-market economy.''
   Bush's pro-capitalism speech was not the first irony visited on
the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences since its founding in
1951.
   The president of the 3,700-student school, Csaba Csaky, said in a
recent interview that his institution had been ``the cradle of the
reform process'' that began moving Hungary's economy away from
strict Marxism-Leninism two decades ago.
   Imre Nagy, the reformist premier abducted by Soviet forces during
the 1956 revolt and later executed, once taught agricultural
economics at the university.
   And, just four months ago, the very hall in which Bush spoke was
the site of the founding congress of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
one of the new opposition groups planning for the nation's first
open elections next year.
   What would Marx think of such activities in an institution that
bears his name?
   Graduate Sandor Katona, asked about Bush's pep talk for
capitalism, said with a smile:
   ``Marx was a philosopher. He would have sat and listened.''

   Embattled leaders of new private businesses
protested Wednesday they are being strangled by oppressive taxes and
bureaucrats who portray them as greedy swindlers.
   Officers of the new Alliance of United Cooperatives told a news
conference they were alarmed by signs of swelling anti-cooperative
sentiment from the populace, the state-run media and even President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms gave rise to the privately run
businesses.
   On July 1, some localities in the Ukraine and Byelorussia began
taxing revenues rather than profits at rates as high as 50 percent,
said Vladimir Tikhonov, president of the alliance.
   ``There is an intentional direction toward strangling the
cooperative movement,'' Tikhonov said. The alliance is pressing for
a maximum tax of 20 percent, on profits rather than revenues.
   The small businesses, which usually share their profits among
several owners, are virtually the only visible success in the
economic reform. More than 100,000 have sprung up in just 2{ years,
and they have created 2 million jobs in an otherwise stagnant
economy.
   Although Gorbachev praised the co-ops Jan. 1, he gave them only
lukewarm support Tuesday in a meeting with Leningrad residents. In
response to their complaints that cooperatives charge exorbitant
prices for poor-quality goods, he said local authorities can
regulate their activity.
   Tikhonov said Gorbachev's statement was ``disturbing'' and ``not
thought through.''
   ``It implied that, `We're giving you the right to tax
cooperatives, and if they're stifling you with their prices, you can
stifle them with taxes,''' he said.
   An article in Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda that was headlined, ``Crazy money,'' slammed
cooperatives for hogging bank loan funds, fueling corruption,
laundering money and charging unjustified high prices.
   Pravda said it was in favor of cooperatives, but against ``dirty
wheeler-dealers.''
   Speakers at the news conference said if the cooperatives fail,
the sluggish economy, already plagued by shortages, will slip even
further into crisis.
   ``It is my conviction there can be no economic reform without
intensive development of the cooperative sector,'' Tikhonov said.
   Tikhonov said bureacratic opposition to the cooperatives,
including stereotypes cultivated by state-run media, is intensifying
as government ministries try to fight competition from the private
sector.
   But in an apparently conciliatory move, Tikhonov said the
cooperatives' alliance is seeking ``a dialogue with the government''
and the businesses hope to win more orders from state firms. The
news conference was held in the Foreign Ministry Press Center, an
indication of a certain amount of government support.
   Although the general law on cooperatives encourages their
development, thousands of lesser directives and decrees issued in
bureacratic forays on the upstart businesses threaten their
existence, speakers said Wednesday.
   For example, one Health Ministry decree forbade cooperative
medical clinics from renting state diagnostic equipment, said Yuri
Vorontsov, head of a medical cooperative.
   The cooperative alliance is seeking repeal of all directives
limiting cooperative activities. ``Now we are a united force that
can stand against those decrees,'' said Artyom Tarasov, head of the
cooperative ``Tekhnika'' and depicted by the Soviet press as a
millionaire.
   Tikhonov said if the restrictions on cooperatives are not
canceled, many cooperatives ``will collapse, they'll fall apart,''
hurting not only their employees but also the state enterprises that
have contracts with them.

   A delegation of American mental health experts
who visited the Soviet Union said Wednesday that more reforms are
needed to prevent hospitalization of dissidents and other citizens
who aren't mentally ill.
   The recommendation was one of several the group made to protect
people against abuse by Soviet psychiatric institutions.
   The Soviets disagreed with some aspects of the study, but
nonetheless called it a ``valuable and useful document.''
   The official 26-member delegation was invited to visit the Soviet
Union from Feb. 26 to March 12 to assess recent changes in Soviet
psychiatry. They examined 15 patients and 12 former patients who had
been released within the preceding two years.
   The visit came amid allegations of psychiatric abuses in the
Soviet Union. One report had cited 346 cases of alleged abuse
between 1977 and 1983.
   But the American delegation said there had been progress in
recent years toward establishing some legal protection for patients
subject to forced confinement.
   In its 117-page report, the delegation said broad concepts of
``social dangerousness'' have contributed to the Soviet practice of
hospitalizing people who aren't mentally ill.
   ``For this and other reasons, the delegation recommends that
additional steps be taken to revise the Soviet Criminal Codes to
remove all prohibitions against expression of political or religious
beliefs,'' it said.
   In addition, the report said new legislation or regulations
appear necessary to limit involuntary hospitalizations solely to
those who are a direct danger to themselves or others.
   The report recommended increased use of defense lawyers to guard
against patient abuse and the institutionalization of periodic
reviews to ensure that hospital stays are not excessively long.
   According to the report, the Soviets generally complied with the
terms of the agreement under which the visit was made, although
there were some ``significant procedural obstacles'' that made
completion more difficult.
   The preliminary Soviet response acknowledged the existence of
such obstacles but said that problem ``by no means meant that the
Soviet specialists artificially created difficulties and tried to
limit access to the necessary information on the patients.''
   As for the allegation by the U.S. team that mental patients have
insufficient legal protections, the Soviets said efforts were being
made to conform Soviet legislation to international standards.
   In addition, the Soviets said, there has been discussion about
creating an independent commission to examine complaints and monitor
institutions.
   The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been interested in
inviting foreign psychiatrists to visit as part of growing Soviet
interest in improving international perception of its human-rights
policy.

   Fifty years after the movies' Mr. Smith came to
Washington, he's coming again, again and again.
   Some of the 1,502 members of the Jim Smith Society _ the only
requirement is to have that name _ are gathering here this weekend.
   The Jim Smith Society was established 20 years ago by _ this is
obvious _ Jim Smith: a good-natured James H. Smith Jr., 68, of Camp
Hill, Pa., retired public relations man and self-described
``founder-president-newsletter editor-chief bankroller.''
   He devotes much of his life to locating Smiths named Jim.
   They gather somewhere every year for a summer festival, with a
golf tourney and a softball game that always poses a challenge for
the scorekeeper.
   ``We've had instances when someone inadvertently calls out, `Hey,
Jim!','' recalls Camp Hill's Jim. ``and 50 heads turn.''
   His grandson, Jim David Smith, 14, of Orange Park, Fla., will
attend. He is the son of Eric Smith, named after the brother, killed
in World War II, of Jim Smith's wife.
   Also attending: Jim Reynolds Smith and his wife, Esther-Louise,
of Indianapolis, with three grandkids. Grand-daughter Stephanie
Smith can introduce her siblings: ``This is my brother, Jim. And
this is my other brother, Jim.''
   Brother Jim Reynolds Smith III is 13. He is known as Jimmy. Jim
Christopher Kenneth Smith is 4. At home, they call him Chris.
   All told, founder Jim Smith expects more than 50 Jim Smiths to
attend.
   Over the years, he has has bent the rules a bit. At the
insistence of one member, the club admitted the member's son, Timmy
James Smith, but only on the condition he would go by T. Jim.
   Timmy hated being left out, during reunions, of the class picture.
   Now there is a sprinkling of M. James Smiths and F. James Smiths.
   W. James Smith of Washington is helping organize the reunion. His
wife will take the class picture with the Capitol in the background
and every Jim holding a sign giving his home town.
   Camp Hill Jim said he considered, but finally ruled out, showing
the old Jimmy Stewart movie, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
   The Saturday bus tour will stop to place a wreath at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in honor of more than 30 James Smiths whose names
are on the wall. Four Vietnam veteran Jim Smiths will conduct the
ceremony.
   On the society's roles are eight women named Jim or Jimmie. Some
lost their Smiths through marriage, but were allowed to stay in.
   But Jimmie Smith of Ruffs Dale, Pa. stayed without trouble. She
married the Rev. Jim Smith. They have a son, Jim.
   The society never met before in Washington, but in 1986 several
members showed up at Arlington National Cemetery for the reburial of
a Civil War Medal of Honor winner whose remains mistakenly had been
put in a pauper's grave. He was Capt. James Smith.
   Founder Jim Smith was asked if the members would have trouble
telling one another apart this weekend. He said they wouldn't.
They'd wear nametags, he explained.

   Children should be kept from large buckets,
especially containers that have been converted to household use,
because of the possibility of drowning, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday.
   At least 67 children, most 8- to 12-months-old, drowned in
buckets from 1985-87, the commission said.
   Most drowned in 5-gallon containers, including those originally
designed for bulk products such as paint, food and spackling
compound.
   ``The 5-gallon bucket is particularly dangerous because its
heavier weight makes it more stable than a smaller bucket and
unlikely to tip over when a child uses it to pull up,'' the
commission said.
   The commission said the Cook County, Ill., medical examiners
office first reported the hazard. The office said all 11 bucket
drownings it has investigated since 1985 involved 5-gallon shipping
containers being used as household buckets.

<TEXT>
   A Khmer Rouge military commander feard
for his supervision of purges and massacres during the group's
Cambodian rule said he wants to retire after Vietnamese troops leave
Cambodia.
   Ta Mok is the third Khmer Rouge leader to announce his retirement
since last month. Diplomats say the Khmer Rouge, the largest
guerrilla group fighting Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, is trying to
clean up its image before an international conference on Cambodia
starting July 30 in Paris.
   Khmer Rouge army radio on Monday carried the text of a June 9
letter that Ta Mok wrote to Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the
group. A translation of the broadcast was seen in Bangkok on
Wednesday.
   After a genuine Vietnamese pullout, he wrote, ``I will from then
on ask to cease all activities within Cambodian state
organizations.'' Khieu Samphan approved this Monday, the radio said.
   Vietnam has pledged to pull its troop from Cambodia by the end of
September.
   Ta Mok was a regional military commander when the Khmer Rouge
ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978. During that time, hundreds of
thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Ta Mok and the other Khmer Rouge leaders fled to the
Thai-Cambodian border to wage a guerrilla war after Vietnam invaded
in late 1978. In recent years, he is believed to have been the top
commander in the northern sector of the border, according to Western
relief workers.
   A radio broadcast Sunday said 63-year-old Nuon Chea, for years
the No. 2 man in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, had asked to retire. On
June 4, the radio said Pol Pot, who led the Khmer Rouge revolution,
had asked to step down.
   The three men are among a small group of Khmer Rouge leaders
widely considered unacceptable in any peace settlement.

<TEXT>
   A reputed cocaine dealer and two former
bodyguards of ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt were ordered to
stand trial today in the 6-year-old ``Cotton Club'' murder of
theatrical producer Roy Radin.
   Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay, who heard two months of testimony
about the Hollywood-related killing, said there was sufficient
evidence presented to support convictions of the defendants at a
trial.
   ``It appears to me the offenses ... have been committed and there
is sufficient reason to find (the defendants) guilty,'' she said.
``They are held to answer.''
   The judge also eliminated one special circumstance, but allowed
two others to stand, making the defendants eligible for the death
penalty if convicted at a trial.
   ``It's what we expected,'' said Deputy District Attorney Sally
Thomas.
   The defendants, Karen DeLayne ``Lanie'' Greenberger, Alex Marti
and William Mentzer were impassive as they stood to hear the judge
render her ruling.
   Moments before the decision, Deputy District Attorney David Conn
had argued that Mrs. Greenberger ordered the killing of Radin
because she perceived him as a threat to her business relationship
with producer Robert Evans.
   Conn said Mrs. Greenberger was determined to get Radin out of the
way so she could continue a lucrative deal with Evans to finance the
movie ``The Cotton Club,'' the story of a Harlem nightclub starring
Richard Gere.
   ``Mr. Radin was an obstacle to further negotiations on the
`Cotton Club' deal,'' Conn said. ``Mrs. Greenberger had a motive to
murder Mr. Radin to remove him from the deal. She knew that Mr.
Evans wanted and desired her to have a greater share in the deal
than Mr. Radin wanted her to have.''
   In addition, he said Mrs. Greenberger blamed Radin for a theft of
drugs and cash from her home and held a grudge against him.
   He portrayed Mentzer and Marti as hired killers who carried out
her instructions.
   Radin was last seen stepping into a limousine with Mrs.
Greenberger on May 13, 1983, en route to a business dinner.
   A month later, his body was found in a dry riverbed 65 miles
north of Los Angeles _ a location identified at the hearing as a
frequent target shooting range for the Flynt bodyguards. Radin had
been repeatedly shot in the head.
   The judge ordered the defendants to be arraigned in Superior
Court on July 18. She ordered no bail and said, ``The defendants are
remanded.''
   The defense attorneys presented no final arguments at the
preliminary hearing, which probed the inner workings of Hollywood
deal-making, the private militia of Flynt and the
multimillion-dollar business of cocaine trafficking.

<HEAD>Boston Ledger Ceases Publication After 52 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Ledger, a weekly newspaper that combined
folksy neighborhood news with tough political reporting, has ceased
publication after 52 years.
   ``It was not an easy decision to make, but the realities of
business set in. The advertising support was just not there,''
publisher Frederic N. Phinney said Wednesday.
   Circulation of the tabloid, which was distributed free, had gone
from 48,000 in 1982 to 29,000 this year.
   In the same period, advertising revenue fell about 40 percent and
the staff was cut to two full-time employees from a peak of eight,
Phinney said.
   The paper focused on events and personalities in Boston
neighborhoods. It also covered the arts and politics and had
something of a love-hate relationship with the administration of
Kevin White, mayor from 1969 to 1985.
   ``Kevin White was a great booster of ours, even though at times
we kicked the living daylights out of him,'' Phinney said.
   ``At its best, the Ledger was something of a cross between a
neighborhood paper for Back Bay-Beacon Hill ... and the Village
Voice, a paper that tried to take an iconoclastic view of life in
the city,'' added John Van Scoyoc, who was the Ledger's editor in
the late 1970s and is now managing editor at WGBH-TV.
   The newspaper was founded in 1937 and was named the Back Bay
Ledger-Beacon Hill Times until Phinney and his father bought it in
1967 and changed the name to The Boston Ledger.
   The Phinney family company, Citizen Group Publications Inc., also
publishes two paid-circulation weeklies, the Allston-Brighton
Citizen and the Brookline Citizen, and a free weekly, the
Charlestown Ledger.
   Phinney said The Boston Ledger's losses had been ``draining the
other papers,'' which will continue to be published.

<TEXT>
   Gun owners in Florida are required to
take reasonable steps to keep loaded weapons out of the hands of
children under a bill signed into law today by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   The legislation doesn't take effect until October, but a national
gun-control advocate says lives are probably already being saved.
   ``People in Florida and elsewhere have become more aware of the
dangers of leaving loaded firearms where children can get access to
them,'' said Bernard Horn, state legislative director for Handgun
Control Inc.
   Publicity on gun accidents involving children has not only
increased public awareness but prompted more safety measures, Horn
said in a telephone interview from his Washington office Tuesday.
   Lawmakers from about two dozen states have contacted Horn's
organization about the Florida bill, including California, New York,
Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and
Virginia.
   ``I think we're going to see some action in some of these
states,'' said Dennis Smith, director of public information for the
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit private research
organization in Washington.
   Florida lawmakers passed the legislation in June after three
children were killed and two wounded in separate gun accidents
around the state during a single week.
   ``I think the unfortunate tragic deaths speak for themselves,''
said Sen. John Grant, a Republican who who sponsored the bill.
   The legislation requires gun owners to take reasonable
precautions to keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out
of the hands of children under 16 years old, such as using a trigger
lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box.
   If a child shoots someone as the result of a careless gun owner,
the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five
years in prison and a $5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor
and up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine if a minor threatens
someone with the gun or displays it in public.

   A man used a photocopier to produce $1 million in
counterfeit $100 bills, the Secret Service said.
   Richard Perez, 39, could face up to 15 years in prison if
convicted of counterfeiting, said Agent Don Tucker.
   Perez was arrested Tuesday after trying to negotiate with an
undercover agent to trade the counterfeit money for 500 pounds of
marijuana, Tucker said.
   Tucker said that Perez produced the counterfeit bills on a copier
belonging to Perez's employer and that the seizure was believed to
be the Secret Service's largest involving counterfeit currency
produced with a color copier.

<TEXT>
   Some common birth control methods fail more often
than a previous study indicated, a new analysis suggests.
   Twenty-six percent of women using spermicides become pregnant
accidentally during the first year of use, rather than the 19
percent previously calculated, researchers said.
   Condoms had about a 14 percent failure rate in the new analysis,
rather than 10 percent.
   The analysis appears in the current issue of Family Planning
Perspectives. The journal is published by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a non-profit organization in New York that studies
fertility issues.
   The authors, Elise Jones and Jacqueline Forrest of the institute,
cautioned that the new estimates are ``subject to a substantial
degree of uncertainty.''
   The estimates are much higher than would be expected if the birth
control methods were used consistently and correctly, the
researchers said.
   They sought to refine estimates published in 1986 by using
results of a birth control questionnaire filled out in 1987 by 9,480
women who had abortions.
   Other new estimates for first-year failure include 6 percent
rather than 5 percent for the pill, 16 percent rather than 14
percent for the diaphragm, 16 percent rather than 13 percent for the
rhythm method, and 22 percent rather than 14 percent for other
methods.
   Sterilization was not included because failures are rare, and
intrauterine devices were omitted because of difficulty in getting
reliable data.

   Striking nurses walked picket lines today
for a second day outside northern California's largest pediatric
hospital, which transferred dozens of critically ill children to
other facilities.
   A line of ambulances began moving young patients out even before
the strike began with the day shift Tuesday morning as some 200
nurses struck for a 26 percent wage increase. Children's Hospital
spokesman Steve Tiger said most of those transferred went to nearby
hospitals, but many children could eventually be sent to facilities
as far away as Los Angeles and Seattle.
   The hospital has transferred 88 children so far, discharged 15
and 41 remained today, Tiger said. Those remaining are the most
critically ill and will be taken care of by doctors and supervisors.
   The hospital issued a statement saying a 7-week-old premature
baby died Tuesday afternoon after being transferred to a Berkeley
hospital. But Tiger said they were not implying the death was linked
to the transfer.
   ``We're definitely not saying that. We think it would be
irresponsible to imply that,'' Tiger said. ``We assumed that the
information would get out anyway. We thought it was more appropriate
that we release it.''
   California Nurses Association spokeswoman Maureen Anderson said
nurses on the picket line didn't know about the death until they
were approached by reporters. Anderson said she was upset the
hospital decided to issue the statement.
   ``This is just going to inflame the situation and I'm sure the
family is having a hard enough time already,'' Anderson said.
   One of the placards carried by a nurse on the picket line read:
``Improve Pay to Improve Care.''
   ``We're special people with special skills and we need special
pay,'' said a 34-year-old picketing nurse, who identified herself
only as Jean.
   The California Nurses Association, which represents the 700
nurses at Children's, rejected an 18 percent wage hike over two
years by a 4-1 margin on Monday.
   ``If we don't do enough to attract people, we won't have the best
and the brightest nurses around for these children,'' said intensive
care nurse Karen Cooper, calling the strike ``a painful step'' to
avert ``an even worse (labor shortage) crisis in the 1990s.''
   Union officials are seeking salaries that would range between
$39,400 and $49,100.
   Children's nurses now make between $32,000 and $39,000, which
places them among the highest paid in the nation.
   No new talks were scheduled. The nurses' previous contract
expired June 30.

   King Hussein underwent a full medical
checkup, including a heart examination, at a London hospital, the
government said Wednesday.
   Hussein, 53, checked out of the hospital Wednesday ``and he is
doing fine,'' said Samir Faraj, the king's personal physician, in an
announcement carried on state-run Jordan Television.
   ``The results of all the examinations, which mainly centered on
the heart and the digestive system, were good,'' said Faraj, who did
not identify the hospital or say how long Hussein was there.
   ``We pray to God to keep King Hussein safe and grant him strength
and prosperity,'' the TV announcement said.
   Hussein flew to Britain July 6.
   ``I hope that you will have full trust that your Hussein is fine
and his health is good,'' Hussein said in a TV broadcast before
leaving Amman.
   The statement appeared to be aimed at quelling rumors he had
suffered a heart attack. The rumors circulated after Hussein made an
unannounced visit to an Amman hospital for a medical checkup.

   A former live-in maid pleaded guilty to
stealing more nearly $900,000 from an elderly paraplegic woman kept
prisoner in her own home.
   Barbara June Stevens, 55, could receive three years in prison at
sentencing Aug. 10.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Stevens confined 71-year-old Valeria Lust to
her Lakeland home by taking away the woman's alker and telephone and
by giving her illegally obtained prescription drugs to keep her
sleepy.
   Some of the $883,534 stolen from the widow in 1987-88 went to
Fountain of Life Inc., a TV ministry in Greenville, N.C., and to
Sonshine Cathedral in Highland City, authorities said.
   Ms. Stevens pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges including
kidnapping, forgery, grand theft and conspiracy. Prosecutors agreed
to drop 55 other charges. She could have received life in prison if
convicted as charged.
   Under the agreement, she must cooperate in a investigation
involving Jim Wittington, president of Fountain of Life, and the
Rev. Daniel Atwood, former pastor of Sonshine Cathedral.
   Neither Wittington nor Atwood _ who is serving a prison sentence
in Pennsylvania for stealing from followers _ has been charged in
the case.
   Ms. Stevens' 28-year-old daughter, Melonie Milling, who also
lived in the Lust home, told investigators her mother secretly
disconnected the phone in the widow's bedroom and told her: ``See,
no one cares, no one calls; your children don't even call.''

   Willie B.'s first date Wednesday wasn't exactly a
romantic triumph, but zoo keepers hope the shy, 31-year-old
gorilla's stroll in the jungle with two females is the start of
something big.
   The 450-pound primate, caged alone from infancy until last year,
was allowed outdoors with female companions for the first time at
Zoo Atlanta.
   Anxiously chaperoning the encounter were experts who want the
western lowland gorilla to mate but who worry the lonely male won't
know how to behave around the opposite sex.
   ``Today is the first day of the rest of Willie B.'s life as a
social animal,'' said zoo Director Terry Maple. ``Whether he will
reproduce is still an open question.''
   There wasn't any monkey business Wednesday, but there were
encouraging signs during Willie's encounter in the zoo's new $4.5
million African Rain Forest habitat.
   Willie wasn't aggressive toward the smaller females, in keeping
with the species' typical behavior that casts the female in the lead
mating role.
   At one point the younger female, 6-year-old Kinyani, approached
Willie briefly, then scampered off and sat. That's normal because
males and females don't have much to do with each other in most
circumstances, said Ronald Nadler, a gorilla specialist with the
Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory University.
   The females are on loan from Yerkes.
   Willie B., who lived in a cage until the rain forest habitat
opened last year, was introduced to female gorillas gradually over
recent months. Wednesday was the first time they had been let
outdoors together, and they will share the habitat from now on.
   Chances of Willie B. mating ``are a long shot because he has been
isolated in captivity so long,'' said Sam Winslow, curator of
mammals at the zoo.
   Zoo keepers want Willie, a ``silverback,'' or adult male, to mate
and add to genetic diversity in the world's population of captive
gorillas.
   But this may be more important to Willie than his species: The
300 western lowland gorillas in zoos worldwide are reproducing at a
rate adequate to prevent inbreeding, Winslow said.
   Willie B., a favorite with visitors, is named for former Atlanta
Mayor William B. Hartsfield.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Would Allow Some Waste Exports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Wednesday that it
wants to continue some exports of waste, including hazardous
material, as long as it is ``handled in an environmentally sound
manner.''
   ``We do not believe that a total ban on all waste exports would
be sound policy,'' said Scott A. Hajost of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Frederick M. Bernthal, the State Department's environmental
specialist, agreed.
   ``Exports of (hazardous) wastes should be allowed to proceed, so
long as they are handled in an environmentally sound manner,''
Bernthal said, adding that the department will ask Congress to ban
all such exports unless the United States has an agreement with the
importing government detailing safe handling.
   ``Wastes not defined as hazardous can be exported freely, without
the knowledge of the U.S. government and perhaps without the
knowledge of the importing government as well,'' Bernthal said.
   ``We do not know how much of this waste is currently exported. In
some cases we have learned of the export only when problems arise in
the importing country.''
   He said Britain and West Germany have recycling plants that the
United States either doesn't have enough of or doesn't have at all.
Some waste also is sent to Canada because its plants are closer to
where it originates.
   Some waste, even hazardous waste, contains metals that can be
sold in other countries.
   An internationl convention was signed in Basel, Switzerland, in
March on the movement of hazardous waste. It will become binding
when 20 governments ratify it, possibly next year.
   The United States will decide soon whether to sign the agreement,
Bernthal said.
   Bernthal objected to a bill that would require all international
agreements to prohibit U.S. exports unless the importing country has
provisions for dealing with it that are as strict as U.S.
requirements.
   ``There is no international consensus that one particular method
of disposing of wastes is the only method which protects human
health and the environment,'' he said.
   Hajost suggested that the bill should allow the government to
stop exports if it has reason to believe that the waste will not be
handled properly in the importing country.
   The bill was supported by William Y. Brown of Waste Management
Inc., a large private company, because it requires a government
permit for the export of any waste.
   ``The world is too small for any nation to observe a double
standard on the environment _ one for what it does within its
boundaries and another for what it can do in the rest of the
world,'' he said.

   The NATO allies are ready two months
ahead of schedule with a proposal to the Warsaw Pact to reduce
troops and non-nuclear armories in Europe, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said Wednesday.
   Baker also disclosed at a news conference here the Western allies
would call for ceilings of 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat
helicopters for each of the military alliances.
   Baker said the proposal, which would limit U.S. and Soviet troops
in Europe to 275,000 on each side, would be submitted in Vienna on
Thursday.
   That is the last scheduled session before a long summer recess.
The talks are due to resume Sept. 5 in the Austrian capital.
   ``By tabling this proposal, we are taking a step toward ending
the military division of Europe,'' Baker said.
   In Budapest with President Bush, Baker also praised the Soviets
for accepting a U.S. proposal for trial monitoring of a
still-unfinished strategic weapons limitation treaty.
   ``We think it is very good that the Soviets have responded
positively,'' Baker said.
   Despite complaints by several private American analysts that it
was a stalling tactic, Baker said trial monitoring ``might well move
arms control forward rather than retarding it.''
   The negotiations to cut long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and
submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent are being held in Geneva.
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov said Monday he
accepted the Bush administration's argument that the two sides could
avoid misunderstandings by finishing trial weapons inspections
before the agreement was concluded.
   The talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to reduce troops,
tanks, non-nuclear aircraft and armored personnel carriers are
proceeding on a separate track in Vienna.
   Submission of NAO's proposal before the recess gives the Soviets
and their allies nearly two months to prepare a reply.
   Bush and the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries agreed at a
summit meeting in Brussels in late May to make a weapons reduction
proposal.
   The president said at the time that an accord could be completed
within six months to a year.
   Among the ceilings tentatively adopted then were 20,000 tanks for
each side and 16,500 to 24,000 artillery pieces.
   There was no numerical agrement at the summit on combat aircraft
and helicopters. Setting ceilings now is not likely to end a debate
with the Soviets over the weapons, Baker acknowledged.
   Negotiators will still have to grapple with deciding which planes
are defensive in nature, and thereby outside bounds of the treaty.
   Also, the Soviets and their allies might try to impose
restrictions on British and French planes. NATO is determined to
resist.
   The decision to present NATO's proposal before the talks recessed
was made last Friday in Brussels by a panel of senior NATO officials
called the high-level task force, a U.S. official said.
   Baker related the decision to move quickly on arms control to
Bush's visit to Poland and Hungary.
   ``These efforts complement each other, and we think, together,
advance the cause of a Europe which is whole and a Europe which is
free.''
   He rejected, meanwhile, a Soviet contention that another Bush
timetable _ accomplishing the reductions by 1993 _ could not be met.
   Baker said Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn had given
assurances that the Warsaw Pact decided at a meeting last week not
to let the quest for an agreement get bogged down in details.
   A senior Soviet Communist Party official said Tuesday in Moscow
that his country would not be able to make all the proposed
reductions by 1993.
   And he said completing the treaty within a year also was unlikely.
   Lt. Gen. Viktor Starodubov said too many weapons and troops would
have to be cut and that Moscow had tried to explain this to the Bush
administration. The general is chief of the disarmament branch of
the Communist party's policy-making Central Committee.

<HEAD>Administration Tries to Calm Criticism of Draft Clean Air Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration tried Wednesday to calm
growing criticism of its draft clean-air legislation and urged
opposing environmental and industry critics to stop ``nitpicking
this thing apart.''
   Officials said they were worried that intense criticism of the
proposed legislation, efore it even reached Congress, could lead to
legislative gridlock similar to that which has prevented passage of
a bill the past decade.
   ``This is the best hope we've had in a long time to break the
10-year logjam,'' said EPA chief spokesman David Cohen. ``We are
being absolutely faithful to the president's commitments. To start
nitpicking this thing apart may pave the way to the gridlock that
has prevented re-authorization of the Clean Air Act.''
   After eight years of inaction on air pollution by the Reagan
administration, Bush promised on June 12 to ``curb three major
threats to the nation's environment and to the health of millions of
Americans: acid rain, urban air pollution, and toxic air emissions.''
   But he only had available then a 14-page outline for the first
major presidential proposal for cleaning the nation's air since
1977. As legislative drafters worked to fill in details of the bill,
copies of their working language have leaked out and the opposing
sides have begun reacting.
   This week, environmental groups and the chairman of the House
environment subcommittee contended the latest draft, dated June 30,
weakened the president's promise for a strong pollution-fighting
campaign. Industry groups said the Environmental Protection Agency
was trying to make the language tougher than Bush wants.
   The environmental side said Bush's proposal was weakened in
sections on auto pollution, emission of toxic chemicals and
reduction of the substances causing acid rain.
   An industry coalition said the draft was tougher than Bush
promised on auto emissions, took away the flexibility of states to
deal with their particular pollution problems, and unnecessarily
increased requirements on industry to reduce acid rain.
   William Rosenberg, assistant EPA administrator for air and
radiatioin, said, ``It's unfair to say we're deviating'' from Bush's
wishes, adding that the proposal would ``get the job done in a
cost-effective way. You have a bill that's 286 pages. The fact sheet
was 14 pages. When you get to the specifics it's much more
complicated.''
   ``The legislative language is a far cry from what the president
said he wanted to do: achieve clean air for every American,'' said
Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce environment subcommittee. ``In the area of smog, they seem
to be willing to give in'' to the auto industry ``rather than
assisting breathing Americans to give them a break.''
   William Fay, head of an industry coalition called the Clean Air
Working Group, said, ``We think exactly the opposite. My response is
that someone got carried away in drafting this thing. There are
things in the staff draft that go far beyond what the president
suggested.''
   One of the most crucial disputes is over motor vehicle pollution.
The draft language would reduce the exhaust standard for unburned
fuel from 0.41 grams per mile to 0.25 grams. But while the current
law requires that each car meet the standard, the draft legislation
would permit automakers to achieve the reduction by averaging all
their autos.
   Waxman said the automakers already are producing cars that would
meet the new limits and would have no incentive under the Bush plan
to make further improvements. Fay called portions of the auto
section ``extreme.''
   The EPA's Rosenberg predicted the automakers would achieve the
additional pollution reduction promised by Bush, because they would
need a margin of safety below the new limits. If the limits were
exceeded, the car makers could face an EPA-ordered recall.
   Rosenberg also brushed off environmental groups' criticism that
Bush would push back _ from the year 2000 to 2001 _ his promised
deadline for reducing acid rain emissions. And he rebutted
environmentalists' insistence that the president's promise of a
10-million-ton sulfur dioxide reduction, the major acid rain
component, was being scaled back to 9 million tons.
   Rosenberg said Bush's year 2000 deadline always meant Dec. 31
that year, and the draft plan simply pushed that back one day to
Jan. 1, 2001.
   The 9-million-ton sulfur dioxide reduction is used in the draft
because the administration is counting the 1-million-ton reduction
already achieved by smelting plants, according to Rosenberg.
   Responding to another criticism from the environmental side,
Rosenberg said draft language requiring consideration of economic
costs in ordering reduced toxic chemical emissions was always Bush's
goal.

   China's premier and Communist Party chief on
Wednesday urged their top diplomats to do a better job in presenting
the official version of its suppression of unarmed pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   State-run media also highlighted visits by foreigners in a
propaganda campaign to show that diplomatic relations have not
suffered from international condemnation of the June 3-4 military
crackdown in Beijing.
   Jiang Zemin, newly appointed general secretary of the Communist
Party, told 151 ambassadors and senior diplomats they must ``help
foreign friends get rid of their misunderstandings'' of recent
events in China.
   Jiang said the diplomats must ``increase their work in explaining
the truth to counter rumors of Western reports.''
   The United States and other Western countries have suspended
high-level government contacts and imposed other sanctions to
protest the attack.
   Foreign countries have also denounced the reported arrests of
more than 2,000 people and the executions of at least 27 who joined
protests.
   China claimed the use of force was necessary to put down what it
says was a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' to overthrow the
government. It says about 200 civilians were killed in the military
assault on the city.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   Premier Li Peng told the diplomats that overseas Chinese students
who participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to China
and won't be punished.
   ``Because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the
Western media, they didn't understand the true situation and
participated in protests and said some extremist words,'' state-run
TV quoted Li as saying.
   Many Western countries have extended the visas of students who
say they fear arrest or persecution if they return to China. Many
students say they don't want to return to their country,
accelerating a brain drain of Chinese students who abandon their
homeland and settle abroad.
   The official media told domestic audiences that foreigners were
returning to China and the nation's relations with foreign countries
were back to normal.
   Television showed senior leaders in meetings with tourism
delegates from East Germany, Kuwait and the United States.
   President Yang Shangkun, a key player in the military assault on
student-occupied Tiananmen Square, met David F. Lee and Peter M.
Chow of the Los Angeles branch of the National Association of
Chinese-Americans and praised their efforts to promote U.S.-Chinese
friendship.
   Lee and Chow were in Beijing for a tourism conference. China's
annual $2 billion tourist industry has nearly dried up in the past
month because of the imposition of martial law and the violence in
the capital.
   The official People's Daily on Wednesday also appealed to Taiwan
not to let China's troubles slow down the easing of tensions.
   The daily acknowledged the crackdown on the student movement,
cited by Taiwan as proof the communists cannot be trusted, had hurt
efforts to increase their contacts.
   ``The recent turmoils in some places on the mainland and the
counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing plus truth-distorting
propaganda by some Chinese and foreign news media have to some
extent had a negative impact on such activities,'' it said.
   In the past two years, Taiwan has eased restrictions on travel to
the mainland and allowed indirect trade estimated at $2.7 billion
last year, but rejected Beijing's overtures for direct talks.
   Chinese police have arrested 13 people accused of spying for
Taiwan in connection with the pro-democracy movement, and on Tuesday
expelled Taiwanese journalist Huang Teh-pei.

   Hungary's enthusiastic welcome for
President Bush and some of the comments made by its leaders may rile
Budapest's East bloc allies.
   On Wednesday, Premier Miklos Nemeth presented Bush with a piece
of the barbed wire that once was the Iron Curtain along the
Hungarian border with neutral Austria.
   The Hungarians started dismantling the barbed wire in May, and
the plaque that went with Nemeth's gift expressed hope other
East-West barriers will fall soon.
   ``It's believed that artificial physical and spiritual walls
still existing in the world some day shall collapse everywhere,''
said the plaque, which a delighted Bush read to reporters.
   The clear reference to ``walls'' seems likely to upset East
Germany, which built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to prevent mass
migration of its citizens to West Germany.
   East Germany and its closest East bloc ally, Czechoslovakia, have
both recently criticized Hungary's political and economic reforms.
   But Hungary's biggest fight is with neighboring Romania, the East
bloc nation most critical of the current changes sweeping Hungary,
Poland and the Soviet Union.
   The ideological differences are fueled by centuries-deep
rivalries over Transylvania, a region controlled by Hungary for
hundreds of years but given to Romania after World War I.
   It is now home to many of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who
live in Romania and who Budapest alleges are being mistreated.
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has already signaled his
displeasure. Emphasizing his rejection of any reform of the orthodox
communism he avows, Ceausescu told a group of Arab visitors:
   ``It is true that this displeases some who attempt even now to
interfere with a few million dollars in the development of some
other countries,'' the official Romanian news agency Agerpres
reported.
   The war of words between the two nations is likely to flare up
anew over a request reportedly made to Bush on Wednesday by the
speaker of Hungary's parliament, Matyas Szuros.
   Laszlo Kovacs, No. 2 official in Hungary's foreign ministry, said
Szuros told Bush that Hungary is concerned about the fate of all
Hungarians abroad and asked the president ``to use his good offices
concerning human rights violations, regardless of where they may
occur.''
   On Monday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn assured
reporters that the first visit to Hungary by a U.S. president did
not mean Budapest was pulling away too fast from its East bloc
allies.
   Hungary wants to ``modernize'' its ties with the Soviet bloc, he
said, but ``we do not intend to alter our relations or to get away
from the Soviet Union or the other socialist countries.''
   And on Wednesday, Imre Pozsgay, the most outspoken reformer in
Hungary's four-man communist leadership, said his country's moves
toward democracy are ``irreversible'' and that his party will step
down if defeated in free elections next year.
   While East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania have strongly
criticized recent political reforms in Hungary, Pozsgay, apparently
buoyed by a weekend Warsaw Pact declaration against interference in
each other's affairs, suggested that Hungarian politics are not its
allies' business.
   Asked whether other Warsaw Pact countries would agree to
Hungary's communists relinquishing power, Pozsgay said simply,
``there is nothing in the Warsaw Treaty to this effect and we do not
have to seek their agreement.'''

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old woman went ahead with an abortion
after a judge cleared the way by throwing out an injunction obtained
by a former boyfriend, the woman's lawyer said Wednesday.
   ``The case is over,'' said Clayton Ruby, the lawyer for Barbara
Dodd, after her client entered a clinic for the abortion Tuesday
night.
   Earlier Tuesday, Justice W. Gibson Gray of the Ontario Supreme
Court set aside the injunction blocking the abortion. Ms. Dodd's
former boyfriend, Gregory Murphy, had obtained the injunction last
week.
   ``We're gratified by the judgment,'' said Robin Rowe, national
coordinator of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League. She
called the injunction ``a fluke'' and said, ``I don't think legally
it's going to set any kind of precedent.''
   Jim Hughes of the Campaign Life Coalition said he was optimistic
despite the outcome because the case had produced the first
restraining order against an abortion. ``In that sense, it was very
positive,'' he said.
   Hughes said he spoke with Murphy and shared his indignation at
``the happy, carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the killing of the
Dodd-Murphy baby.''
   Both Murphy, 23, and Ms. Dodd are hearing impaired. Ms. Dodd, who
was 15 weeks pregnant, listened to the court proceedings through a
sign language interpreter.
   Tears were in her eyes outside the court as Ruby told reporters,
``She hopes that no other woman will ever be put in this situation.''
   The Supreme Court of Canada on Jan. 28 declared the national
abortion law unconstitutional, saying it infringed on the rights of
woman. The outcome legally made abortion a subject between a woman
and her doctor.
   The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision on abortion, which gave
states greater power to restrict abortions, was widely publicized in
Canada.
   The House of Commons has been split on the issue.

<HEAD>Haughey Accepts Coalition He Said Wouldn't Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Charles Haughey was elected Wednesday to
lead a coalition government, reluctantly ending the go-it-alone
tradition of his Fianna Fail party.
   It will be Haughey's fourth term as Taoiseach, as the Irish prime
minister is called.
   ``The formation of this administration is a new departure in our
political life,'' Haughey told the Dail (parliament). ``My Fianna
Fail colleagues and I are making a wholehearted and sincere
commitment to this new administration.''
   The pact with the six-member Progressive Democratic party ended
nearly a month of uncertainty and maneuvering since Fianna Fail fell
short of a majority in the June 15 elections.
   The government pledged to try to cut the standard tax rate, now
34 percent, to 25 percent by 1993, to create 35,000 jobs per year,
and to restore some of the spending cut from the health service.
   It was the first time that Fianna Fail, which formed its first
government in 1932, had accepted a coalition.
   ``Coalitions don't work,'' Haughey said last week as he tried to
line up the votes to put a minority government in power.
   In the end, however, Haughey was forced to meet Progressive
Democratic leader Desmond O'Malley's demand for two seats in the
cabinet.
   O'Malley will be minister for industry and commerce, and his
party also gained the energy portfolio.
   Brian Lenihan will continue as deputy prime minister but will
shift from foreign minister to defense minister. Lenihan missed the
election campaign while recovering from a liver transplant at the
Mayo Clinic in the United States.
   Gerry Collins, the former justice minister, succeeds him as
foreign minister.
   O'Malley, 50, of Limerick, had been expelled from Fianna Fail in
1985 after leading two unsuccessful revolts against Haughey, the
party leader since 1979.
   Fianna Fail deputies in the Dail voted for the coalition
agreement Tuesday following a private meeting in which, according to
The Irish Times, nearly every speaker opposed the coalition.
   Haughey's previous government, elected in 1987, enjoyed the
support of the second-largest party, Fine Gael, as it embarked on
drastic spending cuts and a round of tax reductions.
   Under that government, Ireland posted trade surpluses after years
of deficits, government borrowing was reduced from 12.9 percent of
gross national product in 1986 to 4 percent this year, and inflation
remained under 4 percent.
   However, a drop of nearly two points in the unemployment rate
still left it at 16 percent, and the numbers of job-seekers leaving
the country increased.
   Haughey called the election after the government was unable to
block a bill to create a fund for hemophiliacs who had contracted
AIDS. That defeat, he said, foreshadowed future difficulties for the
government and he appealed to the nation for a majority.
   After opinion polls found a deep distaste for yet another
election and Haughey agreed to talk about a coalition last week,
Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote in The Times of London that it was the
end of ``civil war politics'' in Ireland.
   ``It was only this week that the politics of civil war _ or
rather the Fianna Fail ideology derived from that memory _ were seen
to interfere with the business of governing the country,'' O'Brien
wrote. ``When the people saw that, they called a halt to it.''
   The coalition was unprecedented, said Michael Gallagher, a
lecturer in politics at Trinity College, but its ``long-term
significance will be apparent only some time down the road.'' If the
coalition falters, he said Wednesday, Fianna Fail might revert to
its no-coalition stance.
   Fianna Fail was formed from the losing side of the 1922-23 civil
war. The losers wanted an independent and united Ireland.
   The winners, who were willing to accept a divided island within
the British commonwealth, are associated with Fine Gael, the
second-largest party with 55 seats in the Dail.

   Air Force officials taking their case for the
stealth bomber to the House were met Wednesday with stiff resistance
from budget-conscious lawmakers and a warning that the
half-billion-dollar aircraft could become a ``museum piece.''
   ``Seven to eight billion dollars a year on one weapons system is
twice as much as we're spending on Star Wars. I just can't sell
that,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, told Air Force officials arguing for the second straight
day on Capitol Hill for the B-2 bomber.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Chief of Staff Larry Welch
said that the radar-evading bomber outpaces improvements in Soviet
air defenses and that termination of the $70 billion program would
undermine the nation's nuclear deterrent force.
   The officials also reminded lawmakers that the government has
already invested about $23 billion in the plane and that stretching
out the program over a number of years could raise the aircraft's
price considerably.
   By Aspin's calculations, a single B-2 bomber could cost about $1
billion.
   ``We hope our witnesses today will be able to put the B-2 program
into perspective for us,'' Aspin said at the start of the hearing.
``Otherwise, there remains the very real possibility that the B-2
will become a museum piece.''
   Members of the House panel reacted to the presentation much the
same way as did members of the Senate Armed Services panel who
listened to the Air Force officials on Tuesday.
   ``When the chairman tells you you're not going to get it
politically, you can put it in your pocket and take it to the
bank,'' said Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican
on the committee.
   ``I don't want to equate you to a used car salesman _ you did a
good job with the charts,'' said Rep. Larr J. Hopkins, R-Ky. ``We
have to decide do we want to put this much money in a single
program, can we afford to buy this program.''
   Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., put it more poignantly.
   ``I want to put my head down and cry,'' he said. ``You made a
compelling case but I don't know where to get the money to pay for
it.''
   Recent estimates put the B-2 bomber at a cost of between $500
million and $750 million a plane, making it the most expensive
aircraft in history.
   The Pentagon is proposing spending $4.7 billion in fiscal 1990
for the bomber and about $24 billion over a three-year peak period _
$7.8 billion in fiscal 1992, $8.4 billion in fiscal 1993 and $7.7
billion in fiscal 1994.
   ``Eight billion on one weapons system,'' Aspin said. ``Only 12
other countries have a defense budget higher than that. ... Is this
conceivable. No chance.''
   Lawmakers have balked at the price for a single plane, and
responded with incredulity to the possiblity of stretching out the
program at an increased cost of about $2 billion more a year.
   ``If you make annual cost acceptable, the sticker price becomes
unacceptable,'' said Aspin. ``If you make sticker price acceptable,
the annual cost becomes unacceptable. I don't know how to fix it.''
   In response, Rice stressed that the B-2 is ``critical to
deterrence,'' and told the committee that ``this system, despite the
sticker shock, comes down as the only candidate for some categories
of things we want to do.''
   Rice and Welch said Pentagon estimates show that the Soviet Union
has spent more than $350 billion on air defense over a 20-year
period and plans to invest more money.
   ``That very expensive array of defenses in largely ineffective
against an aircraft with B-2 capabilities,'' the Air Force said in
its presentation.
   But Aspin questioned why the Air Force always argues that the
Soviet air defense is robust when it discusses the B-2 but then
suggests that the Soviet system is not as impenetrable when it asks
for just $1.4 billion to improve the electronics system of the B-1
bomber, which could be used instead of the B-2.
   ``Soviet air defense let a fellow coming in from Germany in Red
Square,'' Aspin said, referring to the West German youth, Matthias
Rust, who flew undetected into the Soviet Union two years ago.
   Rice argued that the United States cannot predict the level of
capability in the Soviet air defense, ``but we certainly can see the
trend.''
   ``There is no doubt that capability is increasing and increasing
dramatically with improvements to their radars,'' Rice said.

<HEAD>Soldiers Fire on Guerrillas After Cease-Fire Ignored</HEAD>

   Soldiers fired on guerrilla bases
around Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday after
the insurgents rejected a cease-fire call and fired rockets into the
capital, the government said.
   The cease-fire took effect at midnight Tuesday to mark the
Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha and was to have lasted four days. It
collapsed after the rebels launched seven rockets on the capital and
government forces fired back, said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   He did not know the number of casualties because most offices,
including the Military Information Department, were closed in
observance of the holiday.
   Amani also said rebels fired rockets on Jalalabad, the capital of
Nangarhar province. The guerrillas have been trying to capture the
city, Afghanistan's fifth largest, since March.
   ``We had no option but to fire back,'' the Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
   Hours before the cease-fire began, government soldiers fired at
least 100 rockets at guerrilla bases in the hills around Kabul, a
city of 2.25 million people.
   The rockets were fired late Tuesday into the Paghman mountains,
12 miles northwest of Kabul, Amani said.
   ``We had information that the opponents had massed a large number
of rockets to hit Kabul during the Eid, so we carried out a
pre-emptive operation,'' he said.
   The government had said its troops would halt offensive actions
until midnight Saturday to celebrate the Islamic holiday, held 40
days after the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting.
   But a spokesman for one of the seven main guerrilla groups based
in Pakistan rejected the offer.
   ``The cease-fire doesn't have any meaning for the muhajedeen
because we began our fight to get rid of the communists, and the
problem is not solved,'' said the spokesman, who goes by the name of
Wakil.
   The guerrillas, supported by the United States and mostly based
in Pakistan, are trying to overthrow the Soviet-backed government
that seized power in a 1978 coup.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have alleged the guerrillas,
along with Pakistani military advisers, are planning an offensive on
Kabul and President Najib's government has warned it may shell
Pakistan.
   Pakistan has denied Najib's charges it is directly involved in
the attacks.
   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military involvement in
Afghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15 under
a U.N.-mediated accord. Moscow has continued to supply arms to the
Kabul government.

   An American photographer who has been
jailed in Afghanistan more than a month said Wednesday he is eagerly
awaiting his promised release _ and a chance to see the Baltimore
Orioles play.
   ``It is very depressing here,'' said Tony O'Brien, a free-lance
photographer who was on assignment for Time-Life Inc. when he was
arrested June 8 for illegally entering Afghanistan with Moslem
rebels.
   ``They treat me very well,'' O'Brien said of his jailers. ``But
it (has been) a long time and I get very depressed. My favorite
Baltimore Orioles baseball team is in first place ... I want to go
home and cheer them.''
   O'Brien, 43, of Santa Fe, N.M., met with journalists on the eve
of the Moslem Eid Al-Adha festival. Agents of the Afghan secret
police, KHAD, watched from a distance as the photographer spoke with
reporters in the courtyard of a Kabul residence, where he was
brought from prison.
   The government said it will release O'Brien if a State Department
official comes to Kabul to escort him home.
   The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said arrangements to send an
officer to Kabul are complete but it has been told O'Brien cannot be
released before the Moslem holiday ends Saturday.
   O'Brien was covering the Afghan civil war from Pakistan, the base
for the seven main guerrilla groups fighting the Afghan government.
   The photographer said he passed time trying to make chess pieces
so that he could teach the game to his cellmate, Nader Ali, an
Afghan.
   ``Whenever I play checkers with him he beats me,'' O'Brien said.
``I want to him make him play chess and then beat him.''

   Firefighters on Wednesday encircled a blaze that consumed
thousands of acres of grass and trees in Nebraska, and rain helped
knock down a 2,000-acre fire in Colorado that destroyed nearly 40
homes.
   Nearly 1,500 firefighters battled one of the last big,
out-of-control fires, a 3,000-acre blaze in brush and trees on
steep, inaccessible terrain near Big Sur, Calif.
   Firefighters also were on the job in Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado, Utah and Nebraska, and the forecast in the West called for
scattered rain but also lightning, which means more fires.
   There were 8,500 firefighters on the line nationwide Wednesday,
but that was expected to fall to 5,000 by Thursday morning, the
Boise Interagency Fire Center reported.
   ``We've had cooler temperatures and scattered rainfall in the
Southwest that have helped things out,'' said Arnold Hartigan,
information officer at center, which coordinates firefighting
nationwide. ``But dry lighting has been forecast for the Sierra
Nevadas in California, and in Oregon and Washington, east of the
Cascades.
   ``But for the rest, we have a couple days' reprieve.''
   Fire crews in northwestern Nebraska used heavy equipment and
shovels to dig a fire lane around an area 8 miles wide and 22 miles
long. ``We have fully contained the fire,'' said Jerry Larson,
deputy state fire marshal. ``The weather is cooperating, the winds
have died down.''
   Larson, after flying over the area, scaled back his estimate of
burned acreage to 50,000 to 100,000 acres.
   The forecast was for lower temperatures and a chance of showers
and thunderstorms. ``It's a mixed blessing ... the chance of rain
versus the chance of lightning,'' Larson said.
   Lightning sparked the fire that had burned since Saturday,
charring acres of Fort Robinson State Park and ranchland. The park
includes the site of old Fort Robinson, a one-time cavalry post
where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed by his jailers.
   In Colorado, about a half-inch of rain fell overnight on a
2,000-acre blaze near Boulder and ``was quite a bit of help'' in
getting the fire 90 percent contained Wednesday, said U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Melissa Carlson.
   The human-caused blaze, sparked Sunday, was believed to have
destroyed 37 homes and damaged numerous other structures.
   At Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado, a
2,600-acre fire was contained late Tuesday and authorities decided
Wednesday to reopen all but a few sections, said John Pasquantino,
fire information officer.
   Scattered showers and cooler weather also helped crews across
Utah get the upper hand on fires that had burned nearly 35,000
acres. Only one fire, in inaccessible terrain near Green River, was
reported out of control.
   In California, officials had pushed back the target for
containing a 2,987-acre near Big Sur to Friday evening, said Maeton
Freel, a Forest Service spokesman. The fire, which investigators
believe was started by an arsonist, was about 55 percent contained
by 937 firefighters, Freel reported.
   Freel said rough terrain and fog that kept some aircraft grounded
had forced the change in the containment time. ``Some of those
slopes are at a 45 degree angle,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Add 100,000 Police Around the Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An unlikely coalition of liberal and
conservative factions said Wednesday that it will back a plan to add
100,000 officers to police forces around the nation.
   ``This is certainly not an ideological issue. This is a survival
issue,'' well-known conservative Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., said at
the unveiling of the Senate bill.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., as liberal as Dornan is conservative,
also has been an outspoken backer of the Police Corps Act of 1989,
which would trade scholarships for service.
   Dornan, Frank and Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced a similar
measure in the House last month and appeared Wednesday with their
Senate colleagues to offer bipartisan support.
   The bill is designed to boost state and local police forces by up
to 22 percent while creating college-educated officers to cope with
challenges such as racial tension and gang warfare. It would add up
to 25,000 officers a year during the first four years of the program.
   The idea was developed in 1982 by a crime study group headed by
New York City lawyer Adam Walinsky and Jonathan Rubenstein, a police
expert who has worked with the Philadelphia police.
   After seven years of lobbying, Walinsky believes the time is ripe
for congressional action.
   ``My thought is that this is a great idea whose idea has come,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said at Wednesday'se news conference.
   Participating students would get federally guaranteed education
loans and have up to $40,000 repaid by the government when they
complete four years in the state police or a local police department
in a sponsoring state.
   Another sponsor, Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said he wants to
create a pilot program in the District of Columbia, providing 50
students with scholarships in exhange for four-year work commitments.
   ``Washington, D.C., has become a paradigm of the nation's growing
problem with violent crime,'' Sasser said. ``It will provide a
rigorous test for the Police Corps concept.''
   The measure envisions bringing the nation's total police force to
580,000 within four years of the program's implementation.
   The cost is projected to rise each year as the program builds _
from $50 million in 1990 to $290 million in 1992, and more later,
Specter said.
   The measure has the support of the national Fraternal Order of
Police and the National Association of Police Organizations, which
represents 90,000 rank-and-file officers.
   Other Senate sponsors include Democrats Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Republicans Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire and Trent Lott of Mississippi.

<HEAD>Florida Gun Bill Signed After 6th Shooting Since June 1</HEAD>

   Gov. Bob Martinez on Wednesday signed
legislation requiring gun owners to keep weapons out of the reach of
children.
   The signing came a day after a Florida child wounded himself in
the finger in the sixth shooting since June 1 of the type the law is
designed to prevent.
   ``This will assist in protecting our children throughout the
state,'' Martinez said. ``The added public awareness will prompt
adults to keep guns out of reach.''
   Three children died and two were wounded in the earlier
shootings, which prompted lawmakers to tackle the legislation during
a special session called on other issues last month.
   The law, effective Oct. 1, requires require gun owners to keep
loaded weapons under lock and out of the hands of children 15 and
under. It also authorizes development of a gun safety program in
Florida schools.
   If a child shoots himself or someone else because of gun left
within reach, the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable
by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a
misdemeanor and up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine if a minor
threatens someone with the gun or displays it in public.
   No grieving parent of an injured or fatally wounded child shot by
another member of the family could be arrested until after seven
days. There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents
and those involving stolen guns.
   The Unified Sportsmen of Florida, the state affiliate of the
National Rifle Association, helped write legislation it could
support after a stronger version it opposed failed to make it
through the Legislature's regular session.
   Republican Rep. Harry Jennings, a retired Army colonel who has
battled two years for an even tougher law, said the attention
surrounding the legislation has already helped cut accidental
shootings in the home.
   Lawmakers from about two dozen states have contacted
Washington-based Handgun Control Inc. about the Florida bill, said
Bernard Horn, the organization's state legislative director.
   ``I think we're going to see some action in some of these
states,'' said Dennis Smith, director of public information for the
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit private research
organization in Washington.
   On Tuesday, a 9-year-old accidentally shot himself in the finger
after finding a .25-caliber pistol atop a refrigerator in his
grandmother's Clearwater home. Tomy Zemko had climbed onto a chair
to reach some potato chips.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday arrested a
television reporter and five other people accused of anti-government
writing, and intelligence agents raided the newsroom of a dissident
newspaper.
   Police said leaflets written by television scriptwriter Yoo
Mong-hee, 24, and five others, aimed at promoting North Korea,
Seoul's communist foe. The leaflets denounced ``Yankee imperialists
who have colonized Korea'' _ a slogan common among radical South
Koreans. They are a minority demanding the United States withdraw
its 43,000 troops in the country.
   The six were charged with violating national security laws,
police said.
   About 40 intelligence agents and 100 police forced their way
through the locked gates of the Hankyoreh newspaper and seized
pictures and notepaper as evidence of a lawmaker's illegal trip to
North Korea.
   About 1,000 riot troopers surrounded the compound and laid out
mattresses to prevent suicide attempts.
   Scuffles broke out when about 30 reporters tried to block the
agents, shouting, ``We refuse to be searched!'' and ``Press
freedom!''
   Police shoved the reporters into a van until they completed their
search.
   ``The surprise search at dawn of the newspaper's editorial room
is unprecedented and is never tolerable,'' said Hankyoreh publisher
Song Kon-ho. ``We will continue our struggle to win a free and
independent press.''
   Wednesday's raid came two days after reporters staged a sit-in
and prevented officers using a search warrant to obtain the material.
   The legislator, Suh Kyung-won, was charged with national security
violations for his August 1988 trip to see North Korean leader Kim
Il Sung. Nine others were jailed and charged with failing to report
Suh's trip, a crime in South Korea.
   An arrest warrant has been issued for Hankyoreh reporter Yun
Chae-gol but action was delayed because he was hospitalized.
   Suh reportedly approached Yun and suggested a story about his
trip, but changed his mind later and the story never was written.
   Witnesses said intelligence agents and police searched the
reporter's desk and files Wednesday and took 23 photographs and some
sheets of memo paper with a North Korean letterhead.
   Opposition parties and the National Federation of Journalist
Labor Unions, which represents most South Korean reporters,
protested that the search violated press freedom.
   President Roh Tae-woo has said he is cracking down on radicals
who want the divided peninsula unified and whom he accuses of
threatening national security. Opponents say the clampdown is an
excuse to suppress all dissent in South Korea.
   Roh accuses North Korea of encouraging secret visits by South
Koreans to stir up unrest. He has postponed parliamentary and other
talks with North Korean officials this month.
   In a letter sent Wednesday to North Korea, Seoul proposed Red
Cross talks on the exchange of hometown visits by separated families
be delayed until Aug. 2. North Korean has proposed holding the talks
Friday.

<HEAD>India Says No Withdrawal Until Peace Accord Implemented</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India said Wednesday it will not
withdraw its peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka until the
implementation of a peace accord aimed at ending an insurgency by
Tamil rebels.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi made the declaration in a
letter to President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   ``India has traditionally been mindful of the sanctity of the
agreements it signs with other countries and of commitments solemnly
undertaken under such agreements,'' Gandhi said in the letter.
``India will under no circumstances deviate from this policy
affecting our concerns.''
   The message amounted to a rejection of Premadasa's appeal to
Gandhi to withdraw the 40,000 Indian soldiers deployed in Sri Lanka
by the end of the month.
   The troops were deployed after India and Sri Lanka signed an
accord July 29, 1987, that called for ethnic Tamil rebels to
surrender their weapons in exchange for limited autonomy.
   India moved in troops to enforce the Tamil surrender, but the
Indian soldiers began fighting the largest Tamil militia, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, when the group refused to accept
the accord.
   Colombo asked India to withdraw its troops after it started talks
with the Tamil Tigers in May, the first direct contact between the
two sides since the insurgency began in 1983.
   India says a premature withdrawal of its troops could spark more
ethnic violence on the Indian Ocean island and could lead to the
killing of moderate Tamils. The impasse has soured relations between
the nations.
   ``I have repeatedly said that the Indian peacekeeping forces'
withdrawal should be worked out through joint consultations along
with a simultaneous schedule for the implementation of the India-Sri
Lanka agreement,'' Gandhi said in his letter. ``We are willing to
resume discussions on this subject at any time and place of your
convenience.''
   Gandhi also said that if joint consultations were not possible,
``we will have to decide the details of the .. withdrawal
unilaterally, consistent with our responsibilities and obligations.''
   The Tamil insurgency has left about 9,000 people dead, including
about 800 Indian soldiers.
   India became involved in the ethnic troubles because of the
sympathies of its politically powerful 60 million Tamils to the
rebel cause.
   The 3 million predominantly Hindu Tamils in Sri Lanka complain of
discrimination by the Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of
the island's 16 million people.
   Also Wednesday, the government closed the nation's six
universities and sent in security forces to search the campuses in a
crackdown on Sinhalese militants.
   Colleges reopened May 10 after being closed for two years in an
effort to curb student unrest and violent anti-government
demonstrations.
   Four of the universities are in the island's central and southern
districts, the stronghold of the Sinhalese radical People's
Liberation Front. The other two are in the northeast.
   The government blames the Sinhalese radicals for more than 3,500
political killings since then. The extremists allege too many
concessions were given to the Tamils.

   Charles Tasnadi, who flew home to
Hungary aboard Air Force One 38 years after fleeing his communist
homeland, said Wednesday he's worried his return is all a dream that
has made him late for work in Washington.
   Tasnadi, 64 and an Associated Press photographer covering
President Bush's trip here, spoke of the emotion he feels seeing the
sites from his childhood, including the bridge he used to cross on
the way to school and the church he attended.
   ``It's so unreal that I see Hungarian writing over shops and
commercial places, as well as on street signs _ all in Hungarian,''
Tasnadi told a colleague.
   ``I said to myself, `now I am going to wake up in Washington,
discovering that I am late to work.'''
   In reality, Tasnadi has become something of a celebrity.
   Wednesday night, as other photographers took his picture, Tasnadi
and members of his wife's family, who still live in Hungary, posed
with George and Barbara Bush at a presidential reception held in the
U.S. ambassador's house.
   ``How are you, Sir?'' Bush boomed out as Tasnadi approached.
``Good to see you.''
   Bush had met with Tasnadi as the presidential jetliner flew
toward Budapest on Tuesday and, the photographer said, told him,
``I'm so happy for you that you are returning the way you are
returning.''
   Tasnadi said he told Bush that several relatives, including two
of his wife's sisters, were still in Hungary.
   ``I would like to meet them,'' Tasnadi quoted the president as
saying.
   So, after a day as part of the photographic pool covering the
president, Tasnadi gathered up his relatives and introduced them to
the president.
   Tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his
sweetheart, Maria, seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the
1950-51 winter to seek a new life. A championship skier, he
concocted a story about heading for the slopes for skiing to avoid
suspicion.
   Joining a group of six other adults and two children, the couple
slipped into Austria through communist mine fields, eluded Soviet
guards and made it to Salzburg several days later. He quickly
married Maria, who stayed home this time even though she has been
back to Hungary twice..

   Poland has asked the members of the
seven-nation economic summit for credits and debt relief totaling
more than $4.3 billion, authorities announced Wednesday, one day
after President Bush's visit.
   In a related development, the independent Solidarity movement
praised Bush's two-day visit and said it hopes for ``the quick
working out and implementation by the industrialized democratic
countries of a broad joint program'' to help Poland.
   Solidarity's leader Lech Walesa asked Bush on Tuesday to assist
in organizing a $10 billion aid package at the three-day economic
summit, which starts Friday in Paris, to nurture democratic reforms
under way in this communist country.
   In a speech to the Polish National Assembly on Monday, Bush
offered Poland $115 million in direct aid, a sum one commentator in
an opposition newspaper said was disappointing.
   But Solidarity, in its first official statement after the visit
Tuesday, expressed only satisfaction with the Bush offer and said it
hopes for further assistance later.
   ``President Bush's visit confirmed once again that the Polish
nation has friends in the West on whom it may count,'' said the
statement issued by union national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
``It also creates hope that a historic chance will not be wasted to
transform countries in our part of the world from a totalitarian
system to democracy.''
   The official PAP agency, meanwhile, released parts of a letter
from Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to French President
Francois Mitterrand, asking for joint assistance from the seven
countries holding their annual economic meeting this weekend.
   Ways to support democracy in Poland and Hungary is to be a chief
topic of the summit of the leaders of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Jaruzelski, who has overseen the legalization of Solidarity after
a seven-year ban and the holding of Poland's freest elections since
World War II, proposed a six-point aid plan for Poland which
includes:
   _$1 billion over two years in supplies and credit guarantees to
build up food reserves to enable introduction of a market-oriented
food economy.
   _$2 billion in credits from the International Monetary Fund under
a negotiated adjustment program to last until 1992.
   _Quick debt rescheduling by the Paris Club for government to
government loans of Poland's $39 billion foreign debt.
   _Rolling back some of Poland's non-government-guaranteed debt and
transforming a portion into other forms of obligations, such as
equity in Polish enterprises.
   _$300 million in World Bank credits to finance export-oriented
investments and a $500 million structural adjustment loan to help
improve Polish exports. The money would be coupled with improvement
of access of Polish goods to Western markets.
   _$500 million from the World Bank or European Investment Bank
over three years to finance food processing and storage facility
improvements, giving Poland the infrastructure it lacks to market
agricultural products abroad.

Crackdown</HEAD>

   Eight leaders of the Chinese pro-democracy movement
emerged from hiding on Wednesday to urge the United Nations to
investigate the military crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators
in Beijing.
   One of the dissidents, 21-year-old student leader Wu'er Kaixi,
told a news conference that the movement remains active in China and
will ``explode ... even larger than before.''
   The Chinese student leaders had not been seen in public since
they fled Beijing after the suppression. Communist Chinese
authorities had been on a nationwide lookout for the student
leaders, and the students did not elaborate on their escape.
   China says 200-300 people were killed in the June 3-4 attack on
students demonstrating for democratic reforms and an end to official
corruption. Chinese sources and diplomatic reports put the death
toll at about 3,000.
   In a letter to the more than 30 heads of state in Paris for a
summit of the world's industrialized democracies and for
celebrations marking the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the
dissident leaders called for:
   _Creating a U.N. investigative commission to look into the
military assault and the wave of arrests and executions that
followed.
   _Aiding the victims of the crackdown.
   _Pressuring the Chinese government to halt repression, including
the imposition of economic sanctions and the breaking of diplomatic
relations.
   Wu'er, the most charismatic and well-known of the 21 student
leaders accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes'' on the Chinese
government's most wanted list, said the pro-democracy movement will
survive.
   ``We think that in the near future a democratic student movement
will explode in China, even larger than before. There are some
students in China who remain active, although obviously they have to
be very careful,'' he said, speaking through a French translator.
   More than 2,000 people were arrested throughout China after the
army crackdown.
   Wu'er, a freshman at Beijing Normal University, was smuggled out
of China to Hong Kong and then Paris with his girlfriend, Liu Yan,
who also spoke to reporters.
   They declined to provide details on how they escaped or where
they had been staying, but said they had neither requested nor
received any special protection from the French government.
   Yan Jiaqi, the leader of the dissident intellectual movement,
said the main task facing those in self-imposed exile ``is to create
an organization, not one of revolution but one of democracy.''
   Chinese sources in Paris, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the dissidents hope to make Paris the permanent headquarters
for the pro-democracy movement in exile.
   Shen Tong, a Beijing University student leader who fled to the
United States, was among those at the news conference.
   Others speaking to reporters included Li Lu, a Nanjing University
student leader, Su Wei of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences,
Xin Ku of Lanzhou University and Wan Runnan, chairman of China's
largest private computer company, the Beijing Stone Group.
   The company, set up about four years ago, had been praised as a
model for Chinese entrepreneurs.
   A research institute set up by the company got involved in
supporting the protests and distributed a petition to convene a
special National People's Congress session to end martial law, which
was declared in May.
   Wan then wound up on the government's wanted list.
   The open letter said the celebration of the French Revolution
``is not just a celebration for the people of France but for all of
humanity in its fight against dictatorship, despotism and tyranny.''
   ``We are convinced that a tempest even stronger is imminent. ...
This fortress of despotism, the oldest and most persistent in the
world, will be upset by the force of the people, and the republican
flag founded on freedom, democracy ... and human rights will one day
fly over Chinese soil.''

   Wherever he went Wednesday in this city
of old world charm, George Bush was given a warm welcome that
reflected Hungary's fascination with America.
   At the university where he got a standing ovation, in the market
where he bought a dozen peaches, on the running track where he
jogged with Hungarian children, his reception was enthusiastic.
   And it was clear from his first remarks here, to 10,000 people
who had withstood torrential rains and high winds for Tuesday's
arrival ceremony, that Bush was appreciative.
   ``Long after this rain is gone,'' he said then, ``I'm going to
remember the warmth of the welcome of the people of Hungary.''
   Wednesday's events, if anything, were fodder for even fonder
memories. Thousands lined the presidential motorcade routes, pouring
out of offices and stores to wave or just get a glimpse of their
important guest.
   The fascination of Hungarians extended even to the downtown press
centers set up for the Bush trip, where gaggles gathered throughout
the day.
   ``Look, White House,'' one Hungarian father proudly told his son
as a reporter wearing a White House pass dashed by.
   After early morning meetings with the country's leaders, Bush met
with 13 students and wound up giving two a ride to Karl Marx
University for his speech lauding Hungary's moves toward a
free-market economy.
   Along the way, he abruptly had his motorcade stopped to greet
wellwishers lining his path. Plunging into the crowd, at one point
he spent more than a minute talking with three small children.
   After the speech, interrupted numerous times by applause and
given a standing ovation at its end, Bush was surrounded by another
adoring crowd at the nearby Dimitrov Square food market.
   The president paid for his peaches and, making his way through
the crowded wrought-iron market, told trailing reporters, ``I
recommend these to you.''
   Ebullient, Bush shook hands, signed autographs and blew kisses to
the crowds.
   Later on, he was signing autographs again _ this time on kids'
jogging shoes.
   The youngsters were his workout partners as he did laps at a
sports complex. The gaggle of 30 young runners then crowded around
Bush, thrusting their shoes and scraps of paper for his signature.
   Asked at day's end to assess his visit, Bush told a Hungarian
television interviewer:
   ``My reaction is a very emotional reaction because they (the
crowds) made both Barbara and me feel welcome. ... I think they were
saying they liked the United States of America very much and, of
course, as an American I'm very moved by that.''
   The warm welcome reflected the Hungarian _ indeed, east European
_ fascination with anything from America, the land that symbolizes
the freedom and prosperity many Soviet bloc citizens feel they have
been denied for 40 years.
   Budapest's crowds have been larger and more exuberant than those
in Warsaw, where turnouts of just 2,000 to 4,000 people at
wreath-laying ceremonies on Monday led to press speculation that
Bush's first presidential foray into eastern Europe would not rival
the rapturous crowds that recently greeted Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in West Germany or France.
   Even before Budapest's warm welcome, however, that had begun to
change in Gdansk, the tough port city that gave birth to the East
bloc's strongest opposition movement, Solidarity.
   Thousands lined the streets when Bush rode into the city Tuesday.
More than 25,000 massed when Bush and Solidarity founder Lech Walesa
spoke at the Gdansk monument to workers killed when government
troops opened fire on strikers in 1970.

<TEXT>
   Voters in the state of Durango chose a new
state legislature and mayors Wednesday, while opposition politicians
complained about slow returns in other state elections and accused
the governing party of fraud.
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI,
always has been strong in Durango and was expected to win a majority
of the 39 races for mayor and the 15 seats in the legislature.
   Another 10 seats are distributed to five minority parties in
proportion to the votes they receive.
   Most of the state's 1,488 polling stations opened on schedule at
8 a.m. Workers were given the day off, and turnout was reported
strong among the 709,000 registered voters.
   ``It's a holiday, and all is very peaceful,'' said Ruben
Cardenas, editor of the newspaper Cima in the city and capital of
Durango. ``Only seven polling stations opened about an hour late
because they didn't receive ballots and other documents on time.''
   As is usual in Mexico, official returns were not expected for at
least a week. Parties may obtain partial results through their poll
watchers.
   The conservative National Action Party hoped to win eight
municipal elections. ``Let's be realistic, we can't go whole hog,''
said the party's leader, Federico Linc Altamirano.
   The leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party said it hoped to win
seven municipal elections.
   There are also four other small leftist parties.
   Landlocked Durango, where John Huston's film ``The Treasure of
the Sierra Madre'' was filmed, lives from timber, mining, farming
and cattle ranching.
   Wednesday's Durango elections and those in five other states July
2 were seen as a test of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
promise to reform an election system that has kept the PRI in power
for 60 years.
   The PRI easily won the July 2 elections for state legislatures in
its strongholds of Campeche and Zacatecas, but the elections for a
new legislature and mayors in the northern state of Chihuahua were
marred by accusations of irregularities.
   For the first time in its history, the PRI conceded defeat in a
gubernatorial race. The winner in the state of Baja California was
Ernesto Ruffo of the National Action Party.
   But PAN leaders complained Wednesday because the state election
board had not yet released full returns for the election of four
mayors and the 24-seat legislature.
   Ruffo, who takes office Nov. 1 for a six-year term, told a news
conference Tuesday night his party plans to contest some of the
results when the state legislature meets to certify the elections.
   In Michoacan state, leaders of the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party were demanding a new election, claiming the
returns giving the PRI 12 of the 24 seats in the new assembly were
fraudulent.
   The electoral board in that western state gave the Democratic
Revolutionary Party six seats. Another six seats are being
distributed to minority parties in proportion to the votes they
polled.

<BYLINE>Organization of Four Rebel Groups Says It Wants Peace Talks ^By

   An alliance of leftist guerrillas said in
a message published Wednesday that it wants peace talks with the
government of President Virgilio Barco.
   However, another guerrilla force, the National Liberation Army,
launched two attacks, one on an oil pipeline and another on oil
storage tanks owned by the U.S. company Texaco. A series of such
attacks has seriously damaged oil production in this country.
   The Simon Bolivar Organization, a loose political organization
that speaks for four guerrilla groups, said in its message that it
wants to work toward ``peace with democracy and social justice.'' It
did not elaborate.
   The group takes its name from the Colombian independence hero.
   Its message was sent to a commission appointed by Barco, a
civilian president, to advise him on the possibility of talks with
guerrilla groups. It was also published by the Bogota newspapers El
Tiempo and El Espectador.
   The commission's members are Roman Catholic Cardinal Mario
Revollo Bravo, former presidents Misael Pastrana Borrero and Alfonso
Lopez Michelsen, and the president of Colombia's National
Organization of Industrialists, Fabio Echeverri.
   Peace talks have had several false starts in Colombia in the last
six years.
   One guerrilla group belonging to the Simon Bolivar Organization,
the April 19 Movement, or M-19, declared a cease-fire earlier this
year. It is working independently toward negotiations with the
government.
   M-19 takes its name from the date of a 1970 presidential election
that dissidents dismissed as fraudulent.
   In an effort to encourage peace talks, Barco offered pardons last
week to guerrillas who give up their weapons. He said legislation
for pardons will go to Colombia's congress next week.
   Other groups in the Simon Bolivar Organization are the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces, the People's Revolutionary Army and the
Quintin Lame.
   There are an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas in Colombia.
   The National Liberation Army, which has sworn never to negotiate
with the government, blew up a pipeline and attacked storage tanks
Tuesday night, the national police said in statements.
   One attack on the country's Pacific coast oil pipeline caused a
spill of thousands of gallons of oil near the town of Bugalagrande,
the Colombian radio chain RCN said. Bugalagrande is 125 miles west
of Bogota.
   The group's other attack was in Medellin, where guerrillas hurled
hand grenades at big storage tanks owned by Texaco, the national
police said.
   The tanks did not explode, and there was no loss of oil, the
police said.
   No casualties were reported in either attack.
   Guerrilla attacks have brought Colombia's oil production down to
312,000 barrels a day from 420,000 barrels last January, the state
oil company Ecopetrol said in a news release Wednesday.

   Bolstering President Bush's $115 million aid package
to Poland, America's key allies at this weekend's economic summit
meeting drew up their own measures to help the economically troubled
nation.
   The Western cooperation, however, was unlikely to amount to much
more than a show of support for a nation undergoing enormous
political change.
   Peter Pietsch, senior economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, West
Germany, said the question was whether the assistance would be ``big
enough to really help to overcome its problems.''
   ``I think Poland will not be feeling satisfied about what is
coming out,'' said Pietsch.
   Bush and the leaders of Canada, West Germany, France, Italy,
Britain and Japan on Friday will hold their first round of
discussions at the economic summit in Paris. The annual gathering
gives its participants a chance to discuss not only the health of
their economies but any pressing political issues as well.
   With the enormous, unexpected changes under way in Eastern
Europe, the summit leaders were expected to devote some of their
time to ways of encouraging democratic reforms there. Bush will give
the leaders his first-hand impressions after winding up a trip
through Poland and Hungary.
   In Warsaw, the president said he would ask Congress for a $100
million ``enterprise fund'' to support private entrepreneurs in
Poland. Bush said he would encourage his summit participants to set
up similar programs.
   In Budapest, Bush offered American help to Hungary as well,
including a promise to seek most-favored-nation trading status,
which would allow liberal terms for Hungarian exports, and a $25
million grant to spur the fledgling free-enterprise system.
   As part of the aid package for Poland, Bush promised to seek
support for ``an early and generous'' rescheduling by Western
creditor governments of some of Poland's foreign debt, a burdensome
$39 billion. Bush said such a move could amount to deferral of about
$5 billion in payments this year.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher earlier told Poland's
Communist Party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, that she would
play a key role in trying to get some payments of the nation's
foreign debt delayed.
   France agreed last month to restructure about $1.2 billion in
Polish debt and provide new bank loans of nearly $100 million. West
Germany will stretch out payments on about $1.3 billion of loans
owed by Poland.
   The British government set up a $38.7 million ``know-how'' fund
for Poland during Jaruzelski's June visit to London. The five-year
program is designed to train Poles to run a more market-oriented
economy.
   Mrs. Thatcher opposes new loans to Poland unless they are
accompanied by a stringent economic program backed by the
International Monetary Fund, the 151-nation lending agency that
provides help to financially strapped nations.
   In granting loans, the IMF usually wants the countries to take
measures to slash high inflation rates, halt the outflow of badly
needed capital, bolster weak currencies and, in general, take a more
market-oriented approach in managing their economies.
   British officials say the Poles have already gone through a hefty
amount of foreign credit without making basic changes in the
structure of the economy.
   ``There's a growing re-realization that for all these debtor
countries there's no substitute for getting them to tackle the
central structural problem,'' said a senior British official,
demanding anonymity.
   ``The problems have to be solved there,'' added Pietsch.
   Poland's economy is beset by high inflation, shortages of meat
and other food products and a rush by workers to find jobs elsewhere.
   Western European countries, acting through the European
Community, have stepped up efforts to increase their economic and
trade links with Poland and other Eastern European countries. Four
of the summit nations _ Germany, Britain, France and Italy _ are
members of the 12-nation trading bloc, also known as the Common
Market.
   In June 1988, the Common Market signed a declaration establishing
official relations with the Soviet-led socialist economic bloc,
called the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The landmark
declaration ended three decades of estrangement between Europe's
economic halves.
   Since then, the community has signed a trade and cooperation
agreement with Hungary and is close to winding up an agreement with
Poland.
   Japan, too, has indicated a willingness to assist Poland.
   ``Although Japan's relationship with the East bloc nations is
weaker than that of the United States and European countries, we are
ready to play an appropriate role to help them,'' said a Foreign
Ministry official in Tokyo.
   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters Japan would
pledge to eliminate or reduce tariffs on goods it imports from
Poland.
   According to Japanese press reports, the government also was
prepared to offer untied bank loans through its Export-Import Bank
to back up Poland's economic and political reforms.
   On Wednseday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he
expected there would be support for a package of aid to reward
Poland and Hungary.
   Asked if the United States expected wealthy nations such as Japan
and West Germany to shoulder a larger part of the burden, Baker
replied, ``Some countries are in a better position to contribute
than other countries are.''
   Meanwhile, the official Polish news agency, PAP, on Wednesday
released part of a letter from Jaruzelski to French President
Francois Mitterrand proposing a six-point aid plan for Poland, which
includes:
   _$1 billion over two years in supplies and credit guarantees to
build up food reserves to enable introduction of a market-oriented
food economy.
   _$2 billion in credits from the International Monetary Fund under
a negotiated adjustment program to last until 1992.
   _Quick debt rescheduling by the Paris Club for government to

   _Rolling back some of Poland's non-government-guaranteed debt and

   _$300 million in World Bank credits to finance export-oriented
investments and a $500 million structural adjustment loan to help
improve Polish exports. The money would be coupled with improvement
of access of Polish goods to Western markets.
   _$500 million from the World Bank or European Investment Bank
over three years to finance food processing and storage facility
improvements, giving Poland the infrastructure it lacks to market
agricultural products abroad.

   Federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings welcomed the
support of New York minister Al Sharpton in fighting impeachment
proceedings Wednesday but stopped short of agreeing with Sharpton's
contention that the Senate effort is racially motivated.
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida history, is
accused of plotting to obtain a $150,000 payoff, lying about it to a
jury that acquitted him in 1983 and improperly disclosing
information obtained from a wiretap.
   He was impeached a year ago and is now on trial by the Senate,
which could remove him from the bench and take away his $89,500
judicial salary. A 12-member panel of senators is hearing evidence
and will report to the full Senate, which will make the final
decision.
   Hastings has contended that if a white judge had been acquitted
in the bribery conspiracy case he would not have been subjected to
impeachment. But he said Wednesday, ``I do not believe there is a
racist bone in the body of any member of the United States Senate.''
   Sharpton, on the other hand, said at a news conference with
Hastings, ``It is double jeopardy at best and an outrageous racist
maneuver to try to deprive us of one of the few black judges in this
country.''
   Hastings noted the crowd at the news conference and said, ``If
Rev. Sharpton has been the hook, then hallelujah. He said he could
``not be judgmental'' about the source of support as he fights to
hold onto his judicial post.
   Sharpton became nationally known as an adviser to Tawana Brawley,
a black teenager who said she was abducted and molested by a group
of white men.
   The minister advised Miss Brawley not to cooperate with the New
York attorney general's investigation of the allegation. She did not
testify and a grand jury later declared the story to be a hoax.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, proclaiming ``the Iron
Curtain has begun to part,'' on Wednesday saluted Hungary's strides
toward economic and political freedom. He pledged to open U.S.
markets to Hungarian goods and send the first Peace Corps volunteers
ever to a communist country.
   His message was greeted with a standing ovation by the students
of Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences, where ``Das Kapital,''
the landmark treatise of the father of communism, is no longer
required reading.
   For Bush, nearing the end of a four-day swing through Poland and
Hungary before flying to Paris on Thursday for the economic summit,
it was another dramatic gesture on his delicate mission of
encouraging democratic freedoms in the East Bloc without
antagonizing the Soviet Union.
   ``For the first time, the Iron Curtain has begun to part, and
Hungary, your great country, is leading the way,'' said Bush,
standing on a university stage against a backdrop of Hungarian and
American flags.
   Bush said Hungary will soon be granted most favored nation
trading status by the United States, and he announced plans to ask
Congress for $25 million in new aid to spur the Hungarians' moves
toward a free-market economy.
   Hungarian leaders gave a delighted Bush a snippet of the barbed
wire fence they recently removed from their border with Austria _ a
barrier that Bush said had stood as ``the ugly symbol of Europe's
division and Hungary's isolation.''
   ``That is just beautiful. That's a marvelous symbol of this whole
visit,'' the president said.
   ``There is no mistaking the fact that we are on the threshold of
a new era,'' Bush said in his speech. ``And there is also mistaking
the fact that Hungary is at the threshold of great and historic
changes.''
   Imre Pozsgay, one of Hungary's four communist leaders, told Bush
the changes in his country were ``irreversible,'' and he said the
ruling communists would ``accept the results of free elections''
scheduled next year and step down if defeated.
   ``It is only the blind and deaf who can neglect the Polish
experience, especially that of the recent elections,'' Pozsgay told
reporters.
   Bush's aid package was similar to the one he presented Monday to
Poland, with a twist: the first-ever Peace Corps volunteers
dispatched to a communist country.
   Their aim will be to teach English to Hungarians. Bush said the
English language is already ``one of the most popular American
exports,'' and a key to closing business deals around the world.
   The students and professors applauded the offer. Two years ago,
Hungary dropped Russian as a compulsory language in the schools.
   In this East Bloc state long home to thousands of Soviet troops
and arms, Bush also outlined his hopes for deep cuts in conventional
arms in Europe. ``We're working day and night to get a solid,
historic agreement,'' Bush said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said later that NATO will
formally present its conventional arms proposal to the Warsaw Pact
in Vienna on Thursday, before those talks recess until September.
   That is two months early and gives the Soviets ample time to
prepare a reply, enhancing Bush's goal of achieving a conventional
arms accord within 12 months, Baker said.
   Baker said he expected there would be support among the Western
allies at the Paris summit for a package of aid to reward Poland and
Hungary for their democratic reforms, but no pricetag has been fixed.
   ``In terms of specific commitments, how many dollars country X is
going to commit in that sort of thing, no, we don't have that yet,
but we will have some substantial discussions when we get to the
summit about this,'' Baker said.
   Bush also held meetings with Hungarian government leaders and
opposition figures. He conferred with student leaders and gave two a
lift to the university in his limousine. After the speech he
strolled through a nearby market, shaking hands and plucking a wad
of Hungarian currency from his pocket to purchase a dozen ripe
peaches.
   Bush said Hungary would be eligible to trade freely with the
United States once it enacts legislation later in the year removing
all barriers to emigration.
   That would make Hungary the first country to escape restrictions
imposed under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik trade law, which imposed trade
barriers on countries that restrict emigration.
   ``Hungary is opening again to the West, becoming a beacon of
light in European culture,'' Bush said. ``I see people in motion _
color, creativity, experimentation.''
   Bush said Hungary faced the challenge of trying ``to build a
structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise
on the ruins of a failed Stalinist system.''
   The speech was shown live on Hungarian television.
   Bush did not repeat the calls he made in Warsaw for austerity
measures. Explaining, John Sununu, the White House chief of staff,
said Hungary had taken long strides toward a free-market system and
``they are quite justifiably proud.''
   Extending another theme from his stop in Poland, the president
was serene in his treatment of the Soviet Union, to which the Poles
and Hungarians are bound militarily in the Warsaw Pact.
   ``The Soviet leaders know they have everything to gain and
nothing to lose or fear from peaceful change,'' Bush said. ``We can
work together to move beyond containment, beyond the Cold War.''
   The $25 million enterprise fund, which requires Congressional
approval, would be administered jointly with Hungarians. It would
support private sector development through hard currency loans or
venture capital grants for approved projects.
   These could include the establishment of a development bank and
funds to enable entrepreneurs to buy into Hungarian state firms.
   Bush also said he will ask Congress for $5 million to establish
an environmental center for Central and Eastern Europe based in
Budapest.
   ``The fate of the earth transcends borders. It is not just an
East-West issue,'' he said.
   Pozsgay, one of the four Hungarian government leaders who met
with Bush, said the first visit by an American president had
satisfied the hosts' expectations and given ``new opportunity both
in the reform of the Hungarian economy and the political reform.''
   Opposition leaders said Bush stressed to them that the
multi-party elections now being negotiated for next year should be
not only free but fair.
   Balint Magyar, a representative of the Alliance of Free
Democrats, said they advised Bush not to send ``the kind of American
help whereby we would have Western technology, but with Eastern
authoritarianism'' controlling it.

   Charlton Heston says Laurence Olivier once
consoled him by saying good reviews are more dangerous than bad ones.
   Heston spoke on Wednesday of his professional association with
the actor, who died Tuesday in London at the age of 82.
   Heston, who starred with the British actor in the 1966 film
``Khartoum,'' said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that Olivier
offered him advice the night a 1960 Broadway play Heston was in
flopped on opening night.
   Called ``The Tumbler,'' the show was directed by Olivier.
   ``He looked at me and gripped my shoulder and said, `Chuck,
what's much, much more important and much harder is you have to
learn to forget the good notices.' That's true. Good notices have
hurt more actors than bad notices ever did,'' Heston said.

   The new movie on the life of rock 'n' roll
pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis draws a trivial portrait of a complex and
explosive personality, says the co-author of a book on which the
film is based.
   ``Once again, Hollywood has people laughing at him, saying
``Ain't he a hoot,'' said Murray Silver, co-author of ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' a Lewis biography published in 1982. Silver wrote the
book with Lewis' former wife Myra.
   ``You could say a lot of things about Jerry Lee,'' Silver said in
an interview published Wednesday in the Commercial Appeal in
Memphis. ``You could call him a wife-beater. You could call him wild
and reckless. You could call him anything but phony. The movie was
phony. It trivialized some very serious happenings.''
   A piano player and singer known for outrageous stage performances
and a tumultuous private life, Lewis, now 53, is on his sixth
marriage.
   The movie, starring Dennis Quaid and also called ``Great Balls of
Fire,'' is based on a brief period in the late 1950s when Lewis'
promising career was derailed by a scandal over from his marriage to
Myra Brown, his 13-year-old cousin.

   Rose's prolonged battle with baseball over allegations that he

who said Wednesday they are worried the noise could damage monuments
in the ancient canal city.
   The City Council told organizers that the office of monument
protection is worried about damage to buildings in nearby St. Mark's
Piazza.
   Organizers have suggested lowering the volume, but city officials
have not given the OK for the British rock group to perform as

   Promotors had planned to set up special buffers in the lagoon to
absorb the sound.
   The concert is to be free, and spectators plan to watch it from

   Barbara Bush had an emotional tour of a
home for handicapped children on Wednesday and visited a refugee
camp for some of the 30,000 ethnic Hungarians driven from their
homes in Romania.
   She also said she'd love to come back to Hungary when the
president sends the first Peace Corps volunteers to this East Bloc
country to spread the teaching of English.
   The first lady was greeted by 11 children when she arrived at the
St. Anne's home for handicapped children, one of only two the Roman
Catholic church is allowed to operate under the Hungarian Ministry
of Health.
   Mrs. Bush appeared on the verge of tears several times as the
youngsters, many in wheelchairs, performed a skit of Biblical songs
and recitations.
   Mrs. Bush hugged a child and exclaimed, ``Beautiful, beautiful.''
   ``I feel God's love in this wonderful house,'' Mrs. Bush wrote in
the guest book. ``God bless you all. Thank you for letting me share
this great moment. I will care more, thanks to you.''
   Later in the day, Mrs. Bush traveled to a refugee settlement
outside Budapest to tour the facility, which houses ethnic
Hungarians who have fled what they say are repression and dire
shortages in Romania.
   Hungarian officials have said that up to 30,000 ethnic Hungarians
have fled Romania.
   As Mrs. Bush toured the facility, she was told that the family
whose house she was to visit was unable to get through the tight
security for her visit.
   ``Let's get them,'' she said to an aide.
   Peter and Dalmo Felfaliva were escorted to the house and the
first lady exclaimed ``your house is lovely'' as they walked through
the small kitchen and dining room.
   Mrs. Bush, who rounded out her tour of the settlement by signing
autographs and patting children in an eager crowd of well-wishers,
told reporters:
   ``I have often thought the worst thing that could happen to you
would be to have your country taken away from you, and the second
worst thing would be to have no one accept you in their country with
loving arms.''
   At the impromptu press conference, she also declared she'd ``like
to come back with the Peace Corps. I love the Peace Corps.''
   Earlier in the day, her husband announced to applause at
Budapest's Karl Marx University that he would send Peace Corps
volunteers so that more Hungarians could learn English.

   Members of Congress spent more than $13.5
million for overseas travel in 1987-88, often shunning commercial
arlines in favor of the military's more expensive executive
transport service, a study said Wednesday.
   Public Citizen, an independent congressional watchdog, counted
1,053 trips abroad in the two-year period, with House members
stopping most frequently in West Germany, France and the United
Kingdom and senators preferring Switzerland, France and Costa Rica.
   ``A review of congressional foreign travel reveals that some
trips appear to be mere junkets with no compelling purpose,'' the
report, entitled ``Free Flying Congress,''concluded.
   In the junket category, the report said, was a journey to five
countries by four House Rules Committee members and four panel staff
members. The committee sets rules for floor debate, but unlike other
committees, has no role in drafting legislation.
   Public Citizen also questioned the need for a trip by 13 House
members and seven staffers to Australia for seven days to help
celebrate the centennial of that nation's parliament.
   The report said it is legitimate for the public to ask Congress,
``Why is the more expensive military transportation used when
commercial travel is generally available?''
   The likely answer, the report said, is that members like the
convenience of the Air Force's 89th Military Airlift Wing, which has
most of its planes at Andrews Air Force base in Washington's
Maryland suburbs. The wing includes the presidential jets and and
other aircraft that fly members of Congress and top executive branch
officials around the world.
   Spouses of members often get free transportation on the overseas
trips, because they don't have to pay when empty seats are available
on military aircraft that have already been chartered for lawmakers.
   ``Because they are not assessed these travel costs, spouses and
other guests are not generally listed in congressional travel
documents, thus making it difficult for constituents to discern when
family or other guests travel with members,'' the report said.
   Reporting rules are so inadequate, the report added, that
published costs of overseas trips are often underestimated.
   The information on members of the 100th Congress, who served in
1987 and 1988, was compiled from figures furnished by committees and
from military records.
   Altogether, 306 House members took 827 trips abroad at a cost of
at least $11.5 million, the report said, while 80 senators went on
226 trips costing more than $2 million.
   The most ``frequent flier'' in the House was Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y., chairman of the Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee of
the Foreign Affairs Committee. He made 14 trips during the two-year
period, making 39 stops in foreign countries, the report said.
   Other frequent travelers, with nine trips, were Rep. George
Crockett, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs western
hemisphere subcommittee, whose trips included 29 stopovers; House
Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., with 20 stops;
and House Agriculture Chairman E. Kika del la Garza, D-Texas, who
had 13 stops.
   The top Senate overseas fliers were Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations western hemisphere
subcommittee, with nine trips and 19 stopovers; Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., a member of the Intelligence Committee, with nine trips and
at least seven stops (some of his stopovers were not revealed); and
John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services Committee, with
eight trips and 10 stops.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Health Insurance Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee gave party-line approval
Wednesday to a measure by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to require American
employers to provide health insurance to all their workers and their
workers' dependents.
   The measure cleared Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee
on a 9-7 vote but is strongly opposed by the administration and
other powerful groups, including many business organizations.
   Coupled with special provisions for children, the Kennedy bill is
intended to provide coverage for the estimated 37 million Americans
not now covered by any public or private health insurance.
   Although many of the details have been reworked, the bill is
similar to one that cleared the committee last year but was not
considered in either the full Senate or House.
   Kennedy noted that the majority of businesses already insure
their workers ``yet two-thirds of all the Americans who lack basic
health insurance protection are workers or members of working
families.''
   ``For more than half a century, we have required employers to pay
a minimum wage, to participate in Social Security, to contribute to
unemployment compensation and to purchase workman's compensation
insurance,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said at the outset of the
committee markup session. ``In 1989, it is time to require the
provision of basic health insurance coverage as well.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, arguing against the measure in a
letter to Kennedy, said enactment of his bill ``would result in a
significant loss of job opportunities, impair our nation's economic
competitiveness, and interfere with the right of employees and
employers to determine between themselves the most appropriate
compensation package to meet their circumstances.''
   The Kennedy bill would require employers to pay at least 80
percent of the insurance premiums for all employees who work at
least 25 hours a week and 100 percent for those who do not make at
least 25 percent above the minimum wage.
   Although employees would have to pay a larger share of the
premium, the health policy would have to be available to those who
work between 17 { and 25 hours a week.
   The insurance package must include hospital care, physician care,
diagnostic tests, prenatal and well-baby care and a limited mental
health benefit. Deductibles could not exceed $250 per individual, or
$500 per family.
   Among special provisions for small employers is a system of
regional insurers to take advantage of group rates and a federal
subsidy for those whose required premiums would exceed 5 percent of
gross revenues of the business.
   Moreover, small employers with fewer than 10 employees who have
been in business less than two years would have to offer a low-cost
insurance plan to their workers but would not have to help pay the
premium. Finally, the bill would be phased in over a five-year
period for employers with five or fewer workers.

   Bill Williams was featured in the film and
says it humiliates him. But Vladimir Semyonov was also in ``Titicut
Follies'' and wants the world to see the shocking documentary on a
hospital for the criminally insane that was banned from general
viewing after its debut 22 years ago.
   Williams and Semyonov are among former patients at Bridgewater
State Hospital interviewed by a guardian as a state judge considers
a renewed request by award-winning filmmaker Frederick Wiseman to
release his first movie.
   The 85 minutes of cinema verite in black and white opened the
door to what Superior Court Judge Harry Kalus labeled a ``nightmare
of ghoulish obscenities'' when he banned the film at the state's
request in 1967 on grounds it violated patients' privacy rights.
   The camera captures bare cells housing often nude men, guards
taunting patients and general chaos. One man is shown being force
fed as he lies on a table and liquid is poured down a rubber hose
shoved into his nose.
   The views of Williams, Semyonov and nearly 20 others are central
to the case before Superior Court Justice Andrew Gill Meyer, who
said Wednesday that he hopes to issue a decision by early next month
on whether to lift the ban.
   ``The stigma will last to my grave,'' said Williams, who after
leaving Bridgewater in the 1970s went to college and became a drug
counselor.
   Semyonov, who lives less than a mile from Williams in this gritty
city 15 miles south of Boston, feels much differently about the film.
   ``I want Bridgewater exposed,'' said Semyonov, who works in a
supermarket and champions the mentally ill. ``The building is
better, but the treatment is the same.''
   The hospital, built in 1852, has been replaced with new buildings
since ``Titicut Follies'' was made in 1966. The movie took its name
from Bridgewater's annual Christmas show. Titicut was the Indian
name for the area.
   Legal battles over the ban continued for several years. In 1969,
the state Supreme Judicial Court upheld the ban on general release
but allowed its viewing by audiences of professionals such as
lawyers, social workers and psychiatrists.
   Wiseman, a three-time Emmy winner, renewed his battle in 1987,
saying conditions had deteriorated at Bridgewater following
improvements in the 22 years since the film was made.
   Case guardian Mitchell Sikora, who interviewed 17 men featured in
``Titicut Follies'' still living in Massachusetts, reported this
spring that showing it now would not be harmful. The state no longer
opposes its release.
   In the documentary, Semyonov is seen pleading to be sent back to
the state prison in Walpole and arguing that heavy doses of
antipsychotic drugs are harming him.
   Semyonov, 51, was convicted of participating in a storekeeper's
slaying at age 16. He was sentenced to life at Walpole, and spent
nine years there before being sent to Bridgewater after complaining
he was being poisoned.
   ``They thought I was crazy,'' he recalled. ``Nobody examined me.
The doctor gave me Thorazine.''
   A social worker took up his case and won his release in 1975.
Today, Semyonov lives in his own apartment. He helped established a
clubhouse in Brockton for former psychiatric patients and served on
the board of the community mental health agency.
   ``I'm satisfied with myself,'' said Semyonov.
   Williams expressed similar satisfaction. ``Life has been good to
me,'' he said during a conversation in his apartment, which is lined
with bookshelves, photographs of his six children and Martin Luther
King Jr.
   Williams, who is in his late 50s, was sent to Walpole in his late
20s, accused of a crime he won't talk about. A prison fight landed
him in Bridgewater. For a black man, Bridgewater was a dungeon, he
said.
   He said it took him five years to win his release from the
hospital and prison. Years later, while studying at the University
of Massachusetts to be a counselor, ``Titicut Follies'' was shown at
one of his classes despite his pleas to the professor, Williams said.
   He said some classmates subsequently avoided him, and others
seemed interested only in a morbid way. ``I told them nothing,'' he
said.
   Williams, who fears the film's potential effect on his family,
figures the ban will be lifted. If that's the case, he said, he
hopes showing ``Titicut Follies'' might ``tell the powers that be:
`People are watching you.'''

<HEAD>Politburo Member Who Lost Election Ousted From Leningrad Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Politburo member who suffered a humiliating
defeat in parliamentary elections lost his job as Leningrad
Communist Party chief Wednesday. He is the first Soviet leader to be
ousted under popular pressure.
   The Leningrad party Central Committee's decision to retire Yuri
F. Solovyov on a pension is a critical step in ``developing the
process of democratization of the internal life of the entire
party,'' said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who attended the
meeting.
   Solovyov also is likely to lose his position as a non-voting
member of the party's 20-person ruling Politburo since he no longer
holds the Leningrad job that put him there.
   Voters in Leningrad, the country's second-largest city, rejected
virtually their entire party leadership in the March parliamentary
elections. Solovyov's defeat was especially embarrassing because he
ran unopposed and still could not win approval from 50 percent of
the voters in this city of about 4.8 million people.
   Speaking in an extraordinary television interview that included
both Solovyov and successor Boris Gidaspov, Gorbachev said the
decision to change leadership came in response to party members'
dissatisfaction. Speakers at the committee meeting complained they
were being left out of political life, Gorbachev said.
   He said the Politburo decided he should go to Leningrad to
discuss the situation with local people.
   The president, who promoted Solovyov to the Politburo three years
ago, also said the party is behind in its efforts to restructure the
Soviet Union.
   ``Many things are not being solved in the proper time, and this
is due to the fact that the party itself does not act in time,'' he
said. ``It lags behind.''
   Gorbachev's statement follows several days of similar comments in
the Soviet press, including the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   After the March election defeat of 12 members of the Leningrad
leadership, a poll found 68 percent of the city's residents and 66
percent of its party members did ``not believe the current party
leadership has the ability to radically change the situation in the
city.''
   Communist activists started a grassroots effort to call a meeting
of all 600,000 party members in Leningrad to oust Solovyov. But
activist Marina Salye said in a telephone interview Wednesday the
recall effort won the support of only 11,000, and they needed
200,000 to force a special session.
   Instead, Solovyov's ouster came at the hands of the Leningrad
Central Committee, a policymaking party group that typically numbers
several hundred, with Gorbachev leading the discussion.
   Solovyov, seated nexted to Gorbachev in the television interview
and appearing unruffled, said the most important task he leaves for
his successor is increasing the authority of the party on a
democratic basis and ``eliminating its complacency.''
   In April, shortly after Solovyov's defeat, Gorbachev sharply
reprimanded him at a Kremlin meeting for complaining that the party
had lost its unity and was becoming ``a discussion club.''
   Solovyov's successor, Gidaspov, is a 56-year-old doctor of
chemistry who was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies in
the parliamentary election, defeating more than 20 opponents. As the
head of an enterprise that runs joint ventures of several industries
without interference from Moscow ministries, he is a leader in
economic experimentation.
   In the television interview, he smiled several times and said his
election as Leningrad party chief over two other nominees came as no
surprise.
   ``Nobody talked to me, not in Moscow, not in the Central
Committee, not Gorbachev,'' he said. ``This is the choice of
Leningraders.''
   He promised to open discussion of the city's problems to a
variety of groups, including environmentalists. He also said
18th-century central Leningrad, now marked by crumbling pastel
facades, should be restored.

<HEAD>Bill Would Impose Federal Control Over Children's TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress must impose significant federal
control over children's television so the medium can be used to
educate the young, Sen. Tim Wirth said Wednesday.
   Broadcasters must ``transform children's television from a `vast
wasteland' to a source of intellectual stimulation and enrichment,''
the Colorado Democrat said in testimony before the Senate
Communications subcommittee.
   Wirth, testifying for a bill he authored to condition license
renewal on broadcasters providing educational shows aimed at
children, said ``broadcasters seem to have abandoned educational
children's programs'' in the wake of the ``deregulation frenzy'' of
the Reagan administration.
   ``Today, not one of the three major commercial broadcast networks
offers a single, regularly scheduled, weekday educational program
for children,'' he said. ``There is no question about it _ the
educational needs of America's children are not being serviced by
the nation's television broadcasters.''
   Wirth's bill goes considerably beyond another measure on
children's TV introduced by Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Wirth's bill would:
   _Reimpose limits on advertising time in children's TV shows that
the Federal Communications Commission repealed in 1984. Those limits
are 9.5 minutes of commercials per hour on weekends and 12 minutes
per hour during weekdays.
   _Reclassify so-called program-length commercials as
advertisements, thereby effectively eliminating them.
   _Require broadcasters to give advance public notice of programs
designed specifically to educate and inform children.
   The Metzenbaum-Lautenberg bill is identical to a measure that
passed Congress last year, only to be pocket-vetoed by President
Reagan. A companion measure is before the House.
   Metzenbaum called children's television an ``abomination'' that
``is truly an embarrassment to our nation.''
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said his group supported the Metzenbaum bill, which he
called a ``fair and reasonable compromise.'' He called Wirth's bill
``unwise and unworkable.''
   Fritts said broadcasters are losing young audiences to cable TV
and VCRs, while production costs for kids' shows are increasing.
   ``Further restrictions and more stringent programming
requirements run the risk of knocking the children's television
marketplace even further out of balance,'' Fritts said, urging the
subcommittee to reject Wirth's bill.
   DeWitt Helm, president of the Association of National
Advertisers, opposed both bills, contending the restrictions are
unconstitutional, don't protect children and invite further federal
advertising curbs.
   Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Congress
had ample precedent for imposing TV ad restrictions. Children, he
said, were a special audience and called the children's TV bill the
most important legislation the panel would consider this year.

<HEAD>GOP House Members Introduce Bill Concentrating on Tax Credits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Whip New Gingrich joined more than
110 fellow House members Wednesday in calling for expanded federal
child care assistance that concentrates on tax credits rather than
direct grants.
   A Democratic bill calling for direct grants has already passed
the Senate.
   Republican Reps. Clyde Holloway of Louisiana and Dick Schulze of
Pennsylvania drafted the new legislation, which Gingrich said
brought House Republicans to ``a pretty unified'' position.
   They drafters claim 115 cosponsors, including about 20 Democrats,
for the bill they introduced Wednesday.
   The Republican measure would expand tax credits for both
lower-and middle-income parents of children under 4 regardless of
whether both parents actually work and pay for outside child care.
   The Democratic bill would made additional federal money available
to states to make direct payments to day care providers and would
establish non-binding federal standards for child care providers.
   The Senate version _ widely known as the ``ABC bill'' _ was
primarily the work of Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.
   Gingrich expressed confidence that the GOP congressmen's
approach, similar to a proposal by President Bush, can prevail in
the House if it gets a straight up-or-down vote in competition with
the Democratic version.
   ``The American people desire to have no procedural games played
with this,'' said Gingrich. ``All we're asking for is a straight up
and down vote.''
   Some Democrats have said they would like to see the House child
care legislation attached to an overall budget reconciliation
measure _ a tactical move that could make it difficult to get a
direct vote on the competing child care bills.
   ``I can't believe the Democrats would try to play that game,''
said Gingrich.
   He said the way the child care legislation is handled by House
leaders _ an issue not likely to be resolved until early fall _ will
be a good measure of House Speaker Tom Foley's stated intention to
give Republican initiatives a fair chance.
   Gingrich said the Republican tax-credit approach is based on the
premise that ``parents are inherently better at taking care of their
children than bureaucrats'' and that women who choose to stay home
to care for their young children should not be discriminated against.
   He said the ABC bill, with its emphasis on uniform standards for
child care providers makes ``an inherent, automatic assumption that
many parents are too dumb to choose child care for their children.''

<HEAD>Hopi Tribe, University Join to Improve Reservation Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hopi tribe and a state university signed an
unusual agreement Wednesday making them partners in a drive to
improve education, cultural resources and economic opportunities on
the tribal reservation.
   ``Today we are beginning to work at trying to intertwine our
culture with the needs of the progressive world,'' Ivan Sidney,
chief of the insular Hopi tribe, said at a signing ceremony
witnessed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and other officials.
   ``We want to be self-sufficient,'' Sidney said. ``We need a
helping hand from the federal government but we do not want to be
totally dependent on the social programs of this country. We have
chosen Northern Arizona University to help us achieve
self-sufficiency.''
   NAU is located in Flagstaff near the Hopi reservation and enrolls
about 800 American Indian students, one of the largest enrollments
in the country.
   Under the agreement, the university and the tribe will work
together to set up a model elementary school; increase child and
family education services; train Hopi teachers; develop a
reservation-wide tourism plan; build a shopping center; set up a
credit association; conduct a labor market study, and strengthen
local businesses.
   Other projects include drafting plans to manage natural
resources, handle solid waste and improve roads; establishing
capital improvement and trust funds; building a new Hopi museum; and
developing two new cultural centers including restaurants, shops and
motels outside the reservation in Winslow and Scottsdale.
   ``We don't believe that there's any program like this in
existence in the country, nor has there ever have been,'' said NAU
president Eugene Hughes. ``We're going to be working with them on
their goals. We see it as a very cooperative venture of mutual
benefit to the Hopi and the university.''
   Hughes estimated the first-year cost of the arrangement, which
takes effect immediately, at $500,000. Sources of money include the
tribe, the university budget, private foundations and corporations,
and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which already is involved
in education activities on the reservation.
   Lujan called the agreement ``a model that can be used in other
areas. Unless those affected set the priorities, the program is not
going to be effective. Everything I see about this spells success.
This is truly self-determination.''
   Asked if the Bureau of Indian Affairs was supposed to be doing
the types of things identified in the agreement, Sidney said yes.
But he added, ``We can't wait on BIA. We have to go forward... We
have to provide direction, set up priorities for what we want. We
have not done that'' until now.
   Hughes said half of the country's Indians live within 250 miles
of NAU. He said the university already has discussed entering into
similar agreements with the Navajo and White Mountain Apache tribes.

<HEAD>Wheat Harvest Expected at 4-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 U.S. wheat harvest is expected to be
at a four-year high of 2.12 billion bushels, a 17 percent increase
over last year's drought-battered crop of 1.81 billion bushels, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   New production estimates for the first time this season included
durum and ``other'' spring-planted wheat, in addition to winter
wheat planted last fall.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said the average
yield, based on indications as of July 1, was estimated at 33.4
bushels per acre, down from 34.1 bushels last year.
   But farmers are expected to have about 63.5 million acres of
wheat for harvest this year, up from 53.2 million in 1988, the board
said.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1989 production of corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops will be issued
Aug. 10, along with revised figures for wheat.
   However, the July report did show new figures for 1989 plantings
of major crops. Corn plantings were estimated at 65.8 million acres
for harvest, up from 58.2 million acres in 1988, and soybeans at
60.2 million acres, up from 57.4 million.
   Cotton plantings were estimated at 10.5 million acres, down 16
percent from 1988. That was also down 5 percent from a preliminary
forecast in March.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.46 billion bushels,
down 6 percent from 1988, reduced sharply in Kansas and some other
parts of the Great Plains by lingering effects of last year's
drought. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   The Kansas wheat crop estimate, however, was boosted slightly to
211.2 million bushels from the June forecast of 202.4 million. Even
so, it was down by more than a third from last year.
   Winter wheat fared better in 1988 because most was harvested or
had matured before the full impact of heat and drought was felt.
   Durum wheat production was estimated at 111.3 million bushels, up
from 44.8 million in 1988, and ``other'' spring wheat was indicated
at 544.1 million bushels, compared with 205.5 million last year.
   Reggie Wyckoff, president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, said the USDA estimate was ``a little higher'' than what he
had expected and that there will be adequate supplies through the
1989-90 marketing year if the projections are correct.
   ``But it also shows evidence that there is disaster in many
areas'' where wheat yields have tumbled, Wyckoff said from the
association's Washington office. ``It's pretty rough in hard, red
winter wheat areas.''
   Department economists say the decline in wheat supplies since
last year's reduced harvest is having only slight effect on consumer
food prices, which are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7
percent, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988.
   A related supply-and-demand report showed that U.S. wheat
inventories may total 592 million bushels by the end of the
marketing year May 31, down from 694 million bushels June 1.
   Last month, when the crop was thought to be smaller, analysts
projected inventories could decline to 500 million bushels next
spring.
   The report showed that wheat prices could average $$3.75 to $4.10
per bushel in 1989-90, down from the range of $3.80 to $4.20
projected in June but still above the $3.72 average for last season.
   Wheat exports were projected at around 1.23 billion bushels, down
from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89.
   Corn production, based on past trends and the current outlook,
was projected at 7.45 billion bushels, up from last year's
drought-shriveled 4.92 billion bushels.
   But the July corn outlook was down from June's projection of 7.85
billion bushels, due in part to late plantings in the eastern Corn
Belt and ``continued limited moisture'' conditions in the West.
   The soybean crop was projected at 1.95 billion bushels, unchanged
from the June forecast and up sharply from 1988 output of 1.54
billion bushels. The price outlook also was unchanged at $4.75 to
$6.25 per bushel, compared with an average of $7.35 in 1988-89.

<HEAD>Heads of State Arrive For Summit; Canada Presents Opera With Painting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heads of state streamed into Paris Wednesday, many
hoping to lobby for debt relief from the world's richest nations
during opulent celebrations marking 200 years since the French
Revolution.
   By Friday, 32 leaders were expected for the economic summit,
including government heads from the seven largest industrialized
democracies and 25 more from five continents.
   Also Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presented
France with a monumental oil painting to hang in the hall of the
Opera Bastille, which was designed by a Canadian architect for the
bicentennial.
   On the eve of the three-day blockbuster celebrations, Mulroney
told French Premier Michel Rocard that ``Point de Rencontre,'' a
huge abstract in glowing primary colors by Canadian painter
Jean-Paul Riopelle, ``celebrates the richness of art and the
creativity and friendship between Canada and France.''
   The gleaming glass-and-steel building designed by Canada's Carlos
Ott overlooks the Place de la Bastille _ the historic site where the
Revolution began 200 years ago when revolutionaries stormed the
infamous prison.
   Pointing to the spectacular panorama of the Paris skyscape _ with
breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower and the twin spires of Notre
Dame _ Mulroney called Ott's design ``a gigantic sculpture of light
and harmonious curves.''
   Also on hand for the presentation were French Culture Minister
Jack Lang and Pierre Berge, president of the Opera Bastille.
   Berge said he was confident the Opera Bastille's inaugural
concert Thursday, starring some of the biggest names in Opera,
including Teresa Berganza and Placido Domingo, would go off without
a hitch.
   The annual summit meeting of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada coincides this year with
the French bicentennial.
   The world leaders will attend the opening of the new Opera at the
Bastille, watch two parades and a fireworks show, and gather for
lunches and dinners as Mitterrand's guests.
   Teams of cleaning personnel worked frantically to ready the giant
construction for its unveiling by French President Francois
Mitterrand before a glittering roster of invited guests.
   On Friday, Parisians _ and millions of television viewers
worldwide _ can watch Jean-Paul Goude's funny and funky
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise,'' which stars 10,000
international dancers and musicians, elephants, zebras and a dancing
bear.
   Festivities also include 36,000 all-night outdoor balls, a
traditional military parade down the Champs-Elysees on Friday
morning, culminating in a spectacular display of fireworks on
Saturday night.
   The new Opera Bastille will close on July 20 for six months in
preparation for its first bona fide operatic production in February
under the musical direction of South Korean conductor Myung
Whun-Chung.

<HEAD>One Medicine for Acid Rain: Tums for the Tundra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some European countries are fighting acid rain
with a ``Tums for the tundra'' approach, dumping massive amounts of
neutralizing chemicals over forests and lakes. But it doesn't help
the forests much, speakers at an international conference on geology
said Wednesday.
   Thomas Paces, a scientist with the geological survey agency in
Czechoslovakia, said in his country miles of dying spruce forests
that receive acid rain are being treated with tons of calcium
citrate, a type of lime, dumped from helicopters.
   ``We are spreading tons of calcium citrate per hectare,'' said
Paces, a delegate to the 28th International Geological Congress.
``But recovery (of the forests) has been very poor.''
   Paces said the major problem in his country and in Poland and
Hungary is sulfur oxides in the atmosphere from the burning of coal.
The oxides combine with water, falling as rain or snow and adding
acidity to the soil.
   Paces said thousands of acres of spruce forests are dying.
   ``You can see spruce forests on mountains turning yellow,'' he
said. ``Large areas of spruce are deforested today due to acid
rain.''
   More than a century of emissions from coal-burning plants in
Europe, said Paces, has slowly caused the soil to turn acidic and is
now taking its toll on plants.
   ``The damage goes unseen for many, many years,'' he said. ``By
the time you can see it in trees, it's very difficult (to correct).
The problems go on for many, many years.''
   Using lime to battle the acid problems is not a good solution,
said Paces, noting: ``It is very, very expensive and it has to be
repeated every four years.''
   Though some theories have been put forward to account fo acidic
damage, most U.S. forest scientists are not convinced that acidity
itself harms trees directly, though other forms of common air
pollution do. Sulfur oxides themselves are highly toxic, and kill
trees on direct impact in high concentrations.
   Owen P. Bricker of the U.S. Geological Survey said that liming
has been tried to a limited degree in this country, but he warned
that treating acid rain problems with neutralizing chemicals ``is
addictive. Once you've started, you've got to keep doing up.''
   Most U.S. liming has been aimed at reducing the acidity of lakes
receiving acid rain.
   Bricker said Sweden is now spending $10 million a year to add
lime to some 5,000 lakes.
   Paces, Bricker and others attending the conference said the only
true solution to acid rain is to reduce or eliminate the emissions
that cause it.
   In central Europe, said Paces, acid rain should be reduced
sharply in 30 years when the supply of coal runs out.
   Bricker said that the test stations established on streams in the
U.S. Northeast have shown that the natural aquatic systems recover
quickly when sulfuric acid falling on them is reduced.
   Bricker said there remains in the U.S. a need to understand more
thoroughly how geology affects the acid rain problem.
   Some rock formations, such as limestone, will neutralize the
acidic rainfal naturally, while other rock types, such as quartz and
granite, react very little. As a result, said Bricker, water passing
through quartz and granite formations would tend to create more acid
lakes and streams.
   ``Local geology is complex and can have great effect'' on the
amount of environmental damage caused by acid rain, said Bricker,
and this is not now being taken into account by federal government
studies of the nation's acid rain problems.

<HEAD>Panel Concerned About Half Million Hazardous Materials Trips Daily</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government rather than the chemical industry
should track the half a million daily shipments of hazardous
materials over the nation's roadways, the chief sponsor of a bill
supported by the nation's firefighters said Wednesday.
   Another congressman said, however, that the relatively low number
of fatalities, injuries and property losses may not justify
proposals that could cost the chemical and trucking industries
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
   The House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on surface
transportation is considering changes in the law to increase
training requirements for drivers, make regulations more uniform
from state to state and keep track of all hazardous cargo with a
nationwide computer system.
   Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, said the bill he is sponsoring
would shift control of hazardous materials shipments, sometimes
abbreviated on road signs as ``hazmat,'' from the chemical industry
to federal, state and local governments.
   ``We believe this shift is vital to protect the health and safety
of our constituents and our communities,'' Applegate said.
   A 1980 agreement between the Transportation Department and
chemical manufacturers set up an industry-run system called Chemical
Transportation Emergency Center, or Chemtrec. It gives local police,
firefighters and others a number to call for information on
hazardous cargo so they will know how to handle various chemicals in
an accident.
   But Applegate said the ``answering service'' is useful only when
the materials involved are known, and this may be difficult at the
site of a crash where chemicals have spilled out and the vehicle is
smashed or ablaze.
   He said placards required on trucks carrying hazardous materials
often are missing or incorrect and the Transportation Department's
emergency response guidebook is not always up to date.
   The Chemtrec system, said Applegate, is ``totally inadequate to
protect the American public.''
   But Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn., ranking minority member of the
subcommittee, said hazardous cargo hauls were involved in only 17 of
the 48,200 traffic fatalities in 1988 and 158 of the nearly 700,000
injuries.
   Shuster questioned whether the hundreds of millions of dollars
that might be collected from shippers or others under proposed
legislation were needed.
   Clifford J. Harvison, president of the National Tank Truck
Carriers, said the tank truck industry supports legislation that
would make laws more uniform regarding hazardous materials.
   ``Trucks cross thousands of jurisdictional boundaries daily, and
carriers cannot tailor the equipment and operational characteristics
of each truck and driver to meet the singular requirements of a
given community,'' Harvison said.
   Frederick H. Nesbitt of the International Association of Fire
Fighters said a system is needed to give emergency personnel quick
information about any hazardous cargo involved in an accident.
   ``The unnecessary dangers our firefighters face every day due to
an antiquated reporting system are inexcusable in this age of high
technology,'' Nesbitt said.

<TEXT>
   NASA, preparing to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of its greatest achievement, lost another top official
Wednesday because of an ethics law that takes effect next week.
   Robert O. Aller, head of the Office of Space Operations, was the
ninth high-level official to resign this year and the third to say
publicly he is leaving because of the law.
   ``Frankly, it's so vague and undefined that I'm not aware of
anybody in government or on Capitol Hill or in industry that really
understands its implications,'' Aller said. ``For one that had
planned at some point in time to go into private industry, it almost
insists that you resign before the 16th of July.''
   The law, aimed at curtailing the ``revolving door'' personnel
relationship between some federal agencies and private industry,
goes into effect Sunday. It has been postponed once.
   The rules will bar federal contractors from hiring government
officials who have supervised their competitors' projects.
   Aller joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
1964 and was deeply involved in the Apollo moon program, which
culminated July 20, 1969, in man's first footfall on another
heavenly body.
   NASA celebrations of that anniversary are expected to include a
call by President Bush for a revitalized space program, perhaps
including a goal of landing on Mars or colonizing the moon.
   NASA's announcement said Aller ``accelerated his departure
because of the vague new post-government employee regulations'' and
because of ``many disappointments in the treatment of government
employees.''
   Among those disappointments, Aller said, is the pay cap imposed
for several years on members of the Senior Executive Service of
which Aller is a member. President Bush last week proposed a
substantial pay increase for the service.
   John Logsdon, a space analyst at George Washington University in
Washington, recently characterized the law as ``a sledgehammer
instead of a scalpel it was supposed to be.''
   William F. Ballhaus Jr. has resigned, effective Saturday, as
director of NASA's Ames Research Center. NASA said Ballhaus cited
``inadequate compensation ... and vague new post-government
employment regulations'' as factors in his decision to leave after
18 years.
   NASA's No. 3 official, Noel Hinners resigned effective May 14 _ a
day before the new law had been expected to take effect _ citing
``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   The resignations added to the management problems facing NASA's
administrator Richard H. Truly, who has been in that job less than
two weeks.
   Truly became acting administrator after the No. 1 and No. 2 men
in the agency, James C. Fletcher and Dale D. Myers, resigned in the
spring.
   John Thomas, who was in charge of the effort to redesign the
space shuttle's solid rocket boosters at the Marshall Space Flight
Center, resigned to work as an executive in the Lockheed Space
Operations Co. at the Kennedy Space Center.
   The other resignations were: E. Ray Tanner, deputy director of
space station operations, in June after only five months on the job;
James Odom, associate administrator for space station, in April
after a year; and Thomas L. Moser, acting associate administrator
for space station for less than a month when he left in May.

<HEAD>Sue Government to Block Rule Relaxing Bridge Inspections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A highway safety group and relatives of victims
of a New York bridge collapse asked a court Wednesday to block
federal efforts to double the allowable time between bridge
inspections.
   ``Less frequent bridge inspections mean more chances for bridge
collapses,'' said Gerald Donaldson, a spokesman for the Center for
Auto Safety, in announcing the lawsuit. He said the Federal Highway
Administration ``is trifling with the lives of millions of
Americans.''
   The target of the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, seeks to invalidate a rule issued in August
1988 by the FHWA.
   The rule, affecting some 122,000 bridges nationwide, allows
states to apply for exemptions from the mandatory two-year
inspection cycle, meaning the bridges are checked every four years
instead.
   Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington have
already sought to exempt more than 15,000 bridges in those states,
the center said.
   The suit argues that in making the new rule, the FHWA ``failed to
properly consider and evaluate the safety impact of the proposed
changes, and furthermore, based its decision upon an invalid
analysis of the regulations' economic benefits.''
   It also charges that the agency failed to provide ``a reasoned
basis'' for deciding to permit inspections every four years.
   An FWHA spokesman did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment on the lawsuit.
   Co-plaintiffs are Virginia Hughes of Troy, N.Y., whose husband,
Donald, was killed in the 1987 bridge collapse on the New York State
Thruway, and William Peck of Schuylerville, N.Y., whose wife, Mary
Louise, and daughter, Kristen, died in the accident.
   In January, the center and the relatives filed a petition with
the FHWA asking it to reconsider the rule. A letter accompanying the
petition pointed out that the National Transportation Safety Board,
which also opposed the new rule, cited insufficient state inspection
practices as a ``major contributing factor'' to the collapse of the
thruway bridge.
   That span fell into the Schoharie Creek on April 5, 1987, killing
10 people. A year later, the chairman of the NTSB made an urgent
call for highway bridge inspections, noting that 43,000 of the
nation's bridges had not been inspected within two years as required.

   A financier and a retired general said
they devised an elaborate scheme to trick Ferdinand Marcos into

   The businessman, Michael de Guzman, and retired Brig. Gen. Jose

Bureau, testified on their scheme before a House of Representatives
committee.
   They said their 1986 plan, called ``Operation Big Bird,'' could
have retrieved billions from secret Swiss bank accounts held by the
former president and his associates. De Guzman said Marcos' Swiss
accounts were worth at least $7 billion.
   In testimony Monday before the House Committee on Public
Accountability, de Guzman said he would have transferred the money
to the Philippine government for a 20 percent fee.
   But he said the government sabotaged the plan by double-crossing
them at the last minute.
   De Guzman said Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez and Senate
President Jovito Salonga sabotaged the plan.
   On Wednesday, Ordonez released a statement saying he opposed the
scheme because de Guzman's Vienna bank, which would have received
the money, was insolvent.
   De Guzman said the scheme was hatched in March 1986 _ one month
after Marcos was ousted from power _ during meetings in Beirut,
Lebanon, with undisclosed figures allegedly familiar with both Swiss
banking regulations and Marcos' finances.
   De Guzman said that on March 20, 1986, Marcos' son, Ferdinand
``Bong-Bong'' Marcos Jr., authorized him to transfer funds from
frozen Swiss accounts to the financier's Vienna bank. Marcos, who
was being watched by American agents, could not perform the
operation himself.
   De Guzman said he got backing for his plan from Jose Cojuangco,
President Corazon Aquino's brother, and other prominent figures.
Accompanied by Philippine officials, including Ordonez, he flew to
Switzerland, where he presented the letters of authority from Marcos
and received a list of the former president's deposits.
   He said the Swiss agreed to a selective unfreezing of accounts
worth $213 million but before a crucial final meeting, de Guzman
said, Ordonez left Switzerland unexpectedly along with the
Philippine government's Swiss lawyers.
   He learned later that the group had telexed Swiss authorities not
to deposit the money in de Guzman's bank but in an account in Credit
Suisse in Zurich.
   The delays and apparent confusion enabled Marcos to learn of the
plan and formally challenge the original letter of authority, de
Guzman said.
   Swiss officials then decided to continue the freeze, which
remains in effect, he said.

<HEAD>First Mutual Fund Set Up to Deal in Hungarian Stocks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist-ruled Hungary will allow its National
Bank to set up a $50 million mutual fund to invest in securities
issued by the nation's private companies.
   The announcement of First Hungarian Fund Ltd., the first mutal
fund among the Communist-ruled countries of Eastern Europe, was made
Wednesday by the International Finance Corp.
   The corporation, a part of the World Bank, is owned by 133
governments _ including Hungary and the United States. Its
president, Barber Conable, is an American.
   Corporation spokeswoman Monique Amaudry said the Hungarian
government would own some, but not a majority, of shares in some
companies in which the fund will invest.
   ``The fund is an offshoot of Hungary's privatization program,''
she said.
   Budapest, after more than 40 years, also has a small stock market.
   The corporation makes loans to private companies in Third World
countries, and to some companies run along private lines but owned
largely by Communist governments. It often buys a small number of
shares in such companies.
   It has already made four investments in Hungary, including stock
in Unicbank, a Hungarian commercial bank opened two years ago.
   It will invest $7.5 million in the new fund, 15 percent of the
fund's $50 million target. It is providing another $40,000 to buy 20
percent of the stock in an group to be set up in Budapest to manage
the fund's investments.
   Ms. Amaudry declined to say how much the Hungarian National Bank
will invest.
   The fund will be closed-end. That is, unless there is a decision
later to increase its capital, no new investors will be accepted
after the corporation and Bear Stearns and Co. Inc. of New York have
placed the shares. These will go to what the announcement called ``a
limited number of sophisticated imnvestors.''
   Each will have to put in at least $500,000, Ms. Amaudry said,
adding that it is not expected that shares will be traded on markets.

   A woman pleaded innocent Wednesday to
murder charges in her 6-week-old daughter's suffocation death nearly
three years after her first baby girl died under almost identical
circumstances.
   Circuit Judge Edward Ferguson told Paula Sims she could be
sentenced to death if convicted of two first-degree murder charges
in the death of daughter Heather Lee, whose body was found in a
trash can May 3.
   Mrs. Sims, 30, told authorities that masked gunmen abducted
Heather and 13-day-old Loralei Marie, who died in 1986, while her
husband was at work. Witnesses have said Mrs. Sims had wanted sons
and was unhappy with daughters.
   The Madison County grand jury, which indicted Mrs. Sims on
Tuesday, said it was weighing whether to charge her 37-year-old
husband, Robert.
   Mrs. Sims, wearing a baggy orange jail jumpsuit and wrist and
ankle shackles, was somber during the 15-minute hearing in this
county seat nearly 30 miles northeast of St. Louis.
   Defense attorney Donald Groshong entered a written plea, and
asked that bail be set for Mrs. Sims, who has been held in the
Madison County Jail since her arrest Tuesday night at her parent's
house in nearby Cottage Hills.
   Ferguson refused to set bond for Mrs. Sims, who had been free on
$350,000 bail on other charges stemming from the deaths. A formal
arraignment will probably come next week, the judge said.
   Mrs. Sims has already been accused of hiding the babies' deaths
and lying to investigators. She has been charged in Madison County
and neighboring Jersey County with obstruction of justice and
concealing a homicide.
   The trial of the Jersey County case has been postponed until next
month. Those charges stem from Loralei's death.
   ``I hope they find out the truth in both cases,'' said Bonnie
Trail, a former neighbor of the Simses in Alton. ``Two babies in
three years, God.''
   Heather's body was found across the Mississippi River from the
family's home four days after Mrs. Sims reported her abducted.
   Loralei vanished 13 days after her birth. Skeletal remains
believed to be those of the child were found a few days later about
150 yards from the Sims home.
   That death remains unsolved. Authorities have said the Simses are
the main suspects.
   Tuesday indictment came after the grand jury heard more than four
hours of testimony from Mrs. Sims' parents, Nylene and Orville Blew.
They were ordered to testify after being granted immunity from
prosecution.
   State's Attorney William Haine said other evidence made the
state's case. ``The physical evidence was very important,'' he said,
but did not elaborate.
   Haine said no decision has been made on whether to seek the death
penalty.
   The first murder count alleges that Mrs. Sims intended to kill
Heather and the second alleges she committed an act she knew had the
strong possibility of ending in death or great bodily harm.
   The Simses also have a 17-month old son, Randy, who was placed in
the custody of the state Department of Children and Family Services
during the investigation of Heather's death.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Shelves Military Aid for Cambodian Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a setback for the Bush administration, the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday shelved a bid to
give U.S. weapons to the non-communist opposition in Cambodia.
   After that decision and several others, the panel voted 17-0 to
report to the Senate floor a bill authorizing $11.6 billion in
foreign aid for the next two fiscal years, a period beginning next
Oct. 1.
   The panel took no action on the Cambodia plan after several
Democrats voiced fears that any arms provided might find their way
into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian faction blamed for
the deaths of at least one million people when it held power during
the 1970s.
   The move by the committee does not necessarily kill the proposal.
Senators said it might be renewed in the form of an amendment on the
Senate floor or during a conference with the House on its version of
foreign aid authorization legislation.
   The committee also voted to impose a $90 million cap on U.S.
military aid for the government of El Salvador, a move intended to
symbolize fears that right-wing death squad activity might be
renewed under that nation's newly elected conservative government.
   The action sparked a brief debate in which Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., said the Senate action would encourage communist insurgents
inside El Salvador.
   The Bush administration's plan to begin arming non-communist
forces in Cambodia opened up deep divisions in the committee and in
Congress generally, fanning memories of the U.S. involvement in the
war in Vietnam.
   The situation is complicated by the fact that Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, has joined a loose alliance
of various Cambodian factions _ including the Khmer Rouge. The
combined aim of the coalition is to oust the government of Hun San
which was installed by occupying Vietnamese forces.
   The administration's position was backed by Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., who offered an amendment authorizing the president to make
military aid available to ``non-communist resistance forces and
non-communist civilians in Cambodia.''
   Robb said his amendment was designed ``to facilitate the
withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia and to prevent the Khmer
Rouge from regaining power'' by arming their opponents.
   But other members objected that the funding provided by the
amendment was open-ended and expressed concern that Sihanouk is an
unreliable and ``mercurial'' ally.
   ``I feel the preponderance of the evidence makes it unwise to
proceed with the Robb amendment at this time,'' said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif. ``It authorizes virtually unlimited military
assistance to a resistance force that is allied with the Khmer
Rouge.''
   In the end, Robb dropped his proposal.
   On El Salvador, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., first proposed
capping military aid at $85 million, last year's level. He agreed to
a $5 million increase.
   Helms told the committee the enemy in El Salvador is the
communist insurgency there, not the conservative government of
President Alfredo Cristiani.
   ``By your vote on this amendment you indicate which way you
stand,'' Helms said.
   Dodd replied: ``To say that because you favor an $85 million cap
you favor Marxism is ludicrous. No one on this committee favors
Marxism.''
   He said the idea of a limit on military spending is to send a
signal that a return to widespread human rights abuses in El
Salvador will not be tolerated.
   ``There are elements that would like to go back to the days where
you could go around that country and pick out people for
assassination,'' Dodd said.
   The committee voted, 11-8 to leave the cap on military aid in the
bill. It then approved the higher $90 million level by voice vote.

   Georgia's Supreme Court blocked the execution
Wednesday of murderer Son Fleming an hour after a parole board ruled
that his low IQ doesn't entitle him to leniency.
   Elsewhere, a federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., refused to halt
Friday's execution of Horace Franklin Dunkins Jr., rejecting claims
that the jury should have been allowed to consider Dunkins'
retardation in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.
   The cases follow a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that the
Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not bar
states from executing killers who are retarded.
   In the Georgia case, the court, in a 4-3 vote, granted an
indefinite stay of execution five hours before Fleming was to die in
the electric chair and an hour after the Board of Pardons and
Paroles denied clemency.
   Fleming, 59, was convicted with two other men in the 1976 murder
of Police Chief Ed Giddens of Ray City, who was shot to death and
his body dumped in a swamp after he stopped a car matching one used
in a robbery.
   In their appeal, Fleming's lawyers cited a 1988 Georgia law that
says a defendant's mental condition can be considered in some cases
when applying the death penalty. However, the law doesn't apply
retroactively to cases like Fleming's.
   His IQ scores range from 64 to 72; a person with an IQ of 70 is
considered mentally handicapped.
   ``Philosophically, I don't want to see mentally retarded people
executed. But my job and oath is to see that the law is carried
out,'' said Attorney General Michael Bowers. He said he made no
recommendation to the parole board.
   Pardons and Paroles Chairman Wayne Snow said the board rejected
Fleming's appeal on grounds that Fleming was aware of the
consequences of his actions despite his low IQ.
   ``We wanted the decision to reflect what the (U.S.) Supreme Court
and others have said in this case,'' Snow said. ``We had to look at
the deliberate action on the part of the person. And we had to look
at their understanding of good and of evil and the consequences to
it.''
   In the Alabama case, defense attorney Steve Ellis argued that the
U.S. Supreme Court ruling requires that a jury consider a
defendant's retardation in weighing imposition of the death penalty.
Ellis said that was not done at Dunkins' 1981 trial.
   U.S. District Judge James Hancock denied a stay of execution,
ruling that that even if jurors didn't consider Dunkins' mental
condition, the judge did.
   ``And that's what's important since the judge is the one who
actually sentenced him to die in Alabama's electric chair,'' he said.
   Dunkins is scheduled to be electrocuted at 12:01 a.m. Friday. His
appeal now proceeds to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   A jury convicted Dunkins in 1981 of murder in the rape and
slaying of Lynn McCurry, a 26-year-old mother of four from Warrior.
She was found in 1980, tied to a tree near her home with surgical
tape and stabbed 66 times.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson will move to the
District of Columbia next month but he remains undecided about
whether to run for mayor of the nation's capital, Jackson aides said
Wednesday.
   The sources confirmed that Jackson will take up a temporary
residence in an apartment building in northwest Washington by the
first week of August while renovation work is completed on a home he
owns.
   By moving to the apartment house, Jackson can switch his voter
registration to the district, easily meeting an election law
deadline that requires mayoral candidates to have lived in
Washington for at least one year prior to the balloting. The next
mayoral election is scheduled for November 1990.
   However, the sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said Jackson has not yet committed to running for mayor.
   ``I talked to him recently about running for mayor, and he said,
``I'm still praying about it.''
   Jackson was traveling from Chicago to Detroit on Wednesday and
could not be reached for comment.
   Jackson's advisors remain divided about whether the two-time
Democratic presidential hopeful should try for the mayor's job in
Washington.
   Some advisors feel it would give Jackson the hands-on political
experience his detractors say he lacks, while others fear that he
could become bogged down with the problems of running an urban
government and tarnish his national image.
   To further complicate his mayoral decision, Jackson has
repeatedly said he would never run against Mayor Marion Barry, a
friend and ally from the civil rights movement.
   Barry, under federal investigation for his ties to a drug suspect
and struggling with city budget woes, has not said publicly whether
he will seek an unprecedented fourth term.
   Jackson's move also is timed to coincide with relocation of the
offices of the National Rainbow Coalition from Chicago to the
nation's capital. While the Rainbow Coalition offices are set to
open by Sept. 1, the sources said Jackson plans to keep his
residence in Chicago.
   In addition, Jackson wants to be based in Washington to more
effectively work on a drive to gain statehood for the nation's
capital, the sources said.

   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., was injured
Wednesday when his car rammed into a security barrier as he was
being driven across the Capitol parking lot to reach the House floor
for a vote.
   Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee,
was treated at Washington Hospital Center for a cut on his forehead
and released, a hospital spokesman said.
   The windshield of the car was shattered when Conyers and the
driver, Cedric Hendricks, were thrown into it, said Capitol police
spokesman Dan Nichols. Hendricks was admitted to the hospital, but
no condition report was immediately available, a spokeswoman said.
   A Capitol ambulance called to the scene stalled, and a city
ambulance had to be called to take the two to the hospital, Nichols
said.
   For security, the Capitol is surrounded by concrete barriers.
Cars may enter only at designated points, and those are protected by
metal barricades that rise hydraulically from the ground and are
controlled by police at a nearby guard station.
   Nichols said the car's speed was one of things being investigated.

   The House voted Wednesday to eliminate $45,000
from the National Endowment of the Arts budget as punishment for
helping fund artworks that desecrate religious articles and show
explicitly homosexual imagery.
   The move, proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, was
approved 361-65 as an amendment to the $11 billion Interior
appropriations bill. It was an alternative to two other proposals by
members of Congress who were outraged at the NEA.
   Stenholm said he was ``concerned about the way the endowment was
moving on certain taxpayer funded projects,'' and wanted to send a
political message that the endowment had to be ``sensitive to the
general public concern.''
   A measure offered by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., would have
wiped out the NEA's entire $144.2 million appropriation. Another was
proposed by Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, would have cut the NEA
budget by 10 percent.
   The fight centered on a photograph by Andres Serrano of a plastic
crucifix submerged in a container of amber liquid later identified
as the artist's urine, and an exhibition of photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe that included depiction of homoeroticism, child nudity,
and sadomasochism.
   The NEA gave the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University
of Pennsylvania $30,000 to display the Mapplethorpe works, and the
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
$70,000 from which it awarded Serrano a $15,000 prize.
   The Serrano award also included funds from the Equitable
Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, said Josh Dare, spokesman
for the NEA.
   Stenholm said he did not see his measure as censorship, but
Armey, whose opposition to the art works led to the floor fight,
disagreed.
   ``The Stenholm effort was censorship by reprisal, specifically
and clearly confined to instances,'' said Armey. ``My effort was
designed to give a very large slug on the head to a stubborn mule,
to say procedurely and systemically you've got to change your
attitude and change your behavior.''
   Armey referred called the arts endowment ``arrogant'' and it was
not in compliance with ``standards of taste, decency, sensitivity,
tolerance.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who opposed all three plans, said they
``take a piece out of America and what America is about and that is
freedom of expression.''
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said it was ``a disgrace for this
body to be considering these amendments.''
   ``Once again we have politicians rushing in to define what is
work of artistic endeavor,'' he said.
   After the NEA battle, the full appropriations bill was approved
374-49.
   The bill also contained language restricting oil leasing in areas
off the coast of California, Florida, Maine to Maryland and for the
first time Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Local television stations, not just cable TV
networks, are increasing the number of Major League baseball games
they carry, a cable TV group said Wednesday in disputing claims that
cable companies are stealing baseball from ``free TV.''
   Local broadcast coverage of professional baseball has grown by
nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years, from 1,190 games in 1975
to 1,647 games in 1989, the National Cable Television Association
said.
   Since 1985, the number of baseball games televised by both local
broadcast stations and by regional cable sports networks has
increased 7 percent, the NCTA said.
   ``As a result, cable's baseball coverage has served to
supplement, rather than reduce, the number of games aired by local
broadcasters,'' the cable association said in a report,
``Availability of Baseball Games on Broadcast and Cable Television.''
   It said some broadcasters have contended that baseball on cable
has reduced the number of games carried by local television stations.
   Complaints about once-free sports television going to cable have
not fallen on deaf ears in Congress. Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., in
May introduced a bill covering sports on cable because of a contract
dispute that blacked out telecasts of New York Yankees baseball
games to 400,000 cable subscribers in the New York City area.
   Lent's bill would allow local authorities to make carriage of
local TV and sports broadcasts part of a franchising agreement.
   The dispute over the Yankees games was settled earlier this month
between Madison Square Garden Network and Cablevision Systems Corp.,
but only after the New York State Assembly passed a bill requiring
cable companies to pay a fine to customers when it pulls previously
guaranteed programs.
   Earlier this year ESPN became the first basic national cable
network to obtain rights to Major League baseball since USA
Network's contract expired in 1982. ESPN will carry 175 games per
season beginning in 1990.
   ABC-TV and NBC-TV have carried between 37 games and 40 games per
season since the early 1980s, and they will air 40 regular season
games this year, the cable association said. Beginning in 1990,
however, CBS will have the rights, and it will air only 12 regular
season games.
   The NCTA study said local stations will televise about 40 percent
of all baseball games in 1989, up from 36 percent of all games in
1985. It said Major League franchises have granted TV rights to 16
of 29 regional cable sports networks for 1989.
   Between 1985 and 1989, 14 of the 26 Major League Baseball teams
made more games available for local broadcast coverage, seven
maintained their level of broadcast coverage and four decreased
their rights agreements with local TV stations, NCTA said.
   At the same time, eight teams increased the number of games for
regional cable network coverage.

<HEAD>Widely Scattered Thunderstorms, Heat Waves Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developed Wednesday over parts of the Plains, the
Midwest and the Appalachians, and in the West, and a heat wave
continued over North Carolina and the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain from the central and
southern Appalachians across the Tennessee Valley, from sections of
Missouri and Arkansas to northern Oklahoma, and in parts of Iowa.
   Heaviest rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.83
inches at Ottumwa, Iowa.
   One to 2 inches of rain fell within an hour in the Appalachians
of southeastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia and northeastern
Tennessee.
   Thunderstorms also were widespread across the Rockies and the
Great Basin area of Nevada and western Utah, with a possibility of
locally heavy rain.
   More showers and thunderstorms were scattered across much of the
Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes region. An isolated severe
thunderstorm produced a tornado near Marion, Ohio.
   Thunderstorms rumbled over sections of Virginia and the
Carolinas, producing wind gusts to 50 mph in Tyrrell County, N.C.
   And temperatures in North Carolina surged toward 100 degrees for
the fifth consecutive day. By 1 p.m., Cherry Point had already hit
100. At 11 a.m., a temperature of 95 and 58 percent humidity
produced a heat index of 113 at the New River Marine Base.
   St. Louis, Mo., had its ninth day of temperatures in the 90s. The
heat there has been blamed for three deaths. During a heat warning
last month, at least five deaths were blamed on the heat. At this
time last year, said the Missouri Department of Health, there were
25 heat-related deaths.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees along the California coast at Crescent City, San Simeon,
Arcata and Hayward to 104 in at Palm Springs, Calif. Wednesday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 35 in the California Sierras, at Truckee.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern and central Rockies across sections of the great
Plains, Arkansas and the Tennessee Valley to the East Coast states.
Widely scattered thunderstorms were forecast over the central Gulf
Coast states and along the Texas Coast.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
in the 70s from New England to the Great Lakes region, and in
sections of the northern and central Rockies; over 100 in the desert
Southwest, and in sections of south-central and southwestern Texas;
and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.

   The Bush administration and prominent American
Jewish leaders are urging Israeli politicians to preserve their
coalition government to prevent the collapse of peace efforts,
Israeli officials said Wednesday.
   A newspaper quoted sources in the Likud bloc as saying Washington
was meddling in Israeli politics, but a U.S. official denied such
interference.
   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot and killed a masked
Palestinian teen-ager who threw stones at an Israeli bus, an army
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules,
said soldiers chased the youth and opened fire after he refused to
stop. He said another Arab was arrested.
   Since the Palestinian revolt began 19 months ago, 559
Palestinians and 35 Israelis have been killed.
   Arab reports said Arab attackers Wednesday shot and wounded a
42-year-old Palestinian woman suspected of cooperating with Israeli
authorities. The attackers also beat her husband, the reports said.
   Also Wednesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 11 Palestinians,
including a 3-year-old girl.
   The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the army will reopen the
1,200 West Bank schools that have been closed for most of the
uprising.
   The army announcement gave no date, but Israel radio said Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was considering starting classes within 10
days.
   The United States repeatedly has asked that the 300,000
Palestinian students be allowed to continue their educations.
   U.S.-Israeli relations have been strained by the decision of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc to harden its stand on
Middle East peace negotiations.
   The left-of-center Labor Party of Vice Premier Shimon Peres has
threatened to quit the coalition in protest.
   ``It's true that the Americans are asking us to wait a little bit
and see whether the peace initiative can be saved,'' said a Labor
source close to Peres.
   The conservative newspaper Maariv quoted Likud sources as saying
the Bush administration has committed ``vulgar political
interference'' in Israel's internal politics. It cited a message
reportedly sent via U.S. Ambassador William Brown urging Labor to
stay in the government.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
described such reports as ``blatantly absurd.'' ``We're not getting
involved in Israel's domestic political issues,'' he said.
   Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly made similar comments,
but he also said he believes hard-liners are damaging prospects for
Palestinian elections in the occupied lands. Kelly, the State
Department's top Middle East official, was testifying before the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
   Labor party sources said Washington may downgrade a delegation to
visit Israel next week that was to have been led by Deputy Secretary
of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Kelly denied the delegation's mission is to persuade the
coalition partners to stay together and said it will discuss
prospects for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said the prime minister will
stress to the U.S. delegation that the hard-line decisions are not
binding on the Cabinet, which approved the peace plan by 20 votes to
six on May 14.
   ``They will hear that the peace initiative exists untouched, with
not a single comma changed,'' Ahimeir said.
   Labor won't make its decision about leaving the government until
early August, but sources predicted it will be difficult for Shamir
to restore credibility to his peace proposals.
   Ahimeir said two prominent Jewish leaders, fund-raiser Max Fisher
of Detroit and Seymour Reich of New York, chairman of the Conference
of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, called the premier to
urge a continuation of the coalition.
   ``Shamir does not need pressure since he believes the national
unity government should be continued,'' said Ahimeir, noting Likud
Cabinet ministers earlier urged Labor to stay in the government.
   The liberal American Jewish Committee sent a letter Tuesday to
Shamir demanding the Likud leader show in ``words and deeds'' his
commitment to the plan to start the negotiating process with
elections in the occupied territories.
   On July 5, Shamir accepted Likud hawks' demands that appeared to
severely limit his flexibility in selling the plan to Palestinians.
   These included barring 140,000 east Jerusalem Arabs from
participating, ruling out a Palestinian state, endorsing new Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and ending the
uprising a precondition for elections.
   Harry Wall, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai
B'Rith in Israel, said many U.S. Jews fear new elections could bring
an extreme right-wing government to power and raise again the ``Who
is a Jew?'' issue.
   They fear small ultra-Orthodox parties would seek a law requiring
all conversions meet Orthodox criteria, alienating Reform and
Conservative sects that predominate in the United States.

<HEAD>Trial Opens for Agent that Sold Drought Insurance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New York agency that allegedly oversold
millions of dollars worth of drought insurance to farmers in 10
states claimed Wednesday it only was acting on the orders of the
insurer, Chubb Insurance of New Jersey.
   James Ringer, representing Chubb, contended in opening arguments
in U.S. District Court that Good Weather International Corp. was
``an agent that went wild and did enormous harm to the farmers and
to Chubb.''
   Chubb is seeking $77 million in damages and some 8,800 farmers in
10 states have asked $20 million plus punitive damages. Chubb
already has agreed to pay the farmers $53 million in an earlier
out-of-court settlement.
   Good Weather of Long Island, N.Y., and Fresno, Calif., is owned
by Henry Cox. The company sold drought insurance for Chubb in 1987
and 1988.
   ``Good Weather was not acting as an insurance company in this
case but as an insurance brokerage,'' said defense attorney James
Moore. He said Good Weather and its agents sold the insurance on the
orders and guidance of Chubb.
   ``You don't sell what you don't have,'' Ringer said.
   Chubb contended Good Weather violated its contract with Chubb by
selling more than the available number of crop insurance policies.
Chubb contends it lost at least $75 million because of the action
and for lawyers' fees to defend itself in the resulting lawsuits.
   The lawsuit represents farmers in Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin.
   Stanley Chesley, representing the farmers, told the eight-member
jury in his opening statement Wednesday that Good Weather knowingly
oversold the policies hoping they would not have to pay off.
   He said the $20 million and damages demanded by the farmers would
make up the losses they suffered when the policies did not pay off.
   The farmers said they suffered emotional distress in being denied
the drought insurance, and sustained crop losses as well as losses
from not being given interest on the money they invested in the
insurance.
   The money sought is in addition to the $53 million Chubb
settlement, which Rubin's special master, Cincinnati lawyer Lawrence
Kane Jr., has been distributing since March.
   The trial is expected to take about two weeks, court officials
said.

<TEXT>
   A man dressed in a Contra rebel uniform
stopped a bus in eastern Nicaragua, forced the passengers out and
killed six of them with a submachine gun, according to government
reports Wednesday.
   Four more people were killed and one man was wounded when the
U.S.-backed rebels attacked the village of Rancho Grande, in eastern
Chontales province, shortly before midnight Tuesday, the Voice of
Nicaragua government radio said.
   About 250 army troops, police with dogs and helicopters, searched
for the attackers Wednesday, according to military sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Both the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario and Barricada,
the newpaper of the governing Sandinistas, said the attack on the
bus occurred Monday in Camoapa, 54 miles east of Managua. Barricada
carried witness accounts.
   No further details on either attack were immediately available.
   El Nuevo Diario quoted regional army commander Lt. Col. Antonio
Castillo as saying the Contras plan to undermine Feb. 25 general
elections by kidnapping people and carrying out acts of sabotage in
the northern provinces.
   The Contras, supported by the United States since they began
fighting the leftist government in 1981, are preparing for these
attacks in southern Honduras, where they have base camps, Castillo
was quoted as saying.
   Meanwhile, the rebels' clandestine radio station, Radio
Liberation, accused the army of carrying out anti-rebel sweeps using
helicopters, heavy artillery and tanks.
   The broadcast, monitored in Managua, said this violated a
cease-fire that the Contras and Sandinistas signed in March 1988.
The cease-fire has been renewed by tacit agreement monthly since
January.
   Only scattered skirmishes have been reported during most of the
last 16 months, but reports of fighting have been increasing.

<HEAD>US Eases Security Rules on Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that it
was easing security rules on the sale of up to $30 billion worth of
goods a year to 18 large trading countries.
   The rules are designed to keep strategic products out of the
hands of the Soviet Union and its allies.
   The countries affected by the change are: Belgium, Luxembourg,
Canada, Denmark, West Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Britain, Australia,
Switzerland and Finland.
   All but Switzerland and Finland are U.S. allies and members of
the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, a
semi-secret organization in Paris.
   U.S. authorities said Switzerland and Finland had adopted control
systems effective enough to be included in the new rules though they
do not belong to the Paris group.
   Goods affected are those that can be used for civilian or
military purposes and include most kinds of computers, telephone
switching equipment and some machine tools.
   Commerce Department licenses will no longer be required to export
those goods, nor will the 18 governments have to ask U.S. permission
to re-export the goods to one another. They still will have to ask
permission to sell the goods to countries not in the group.
   Approval will also still be needed for trade within the group of
some items such as supercomputers and eavesdropping equipment.
   U.S. exporters have long complained about the time and paperwork
needed to get export licenses, especially when other governments
permitted similar goods to be sold freely.

   The conservative National Action Party swept
state elections for governor and the legislature in Baja California,
handing the governing party its biggest upset in 60 years, according
to returns Wednesday.
   In the race for mayors and city halls, National Action candidates
tied with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
PRI, taking Tijuana and Ensenada. The PRI won in Mexicali and Tecate.
   The returns, released by the state election board, showed that
National Action took eight of 15 seats in the Baja California
legislature in July 2 balloting.
   Four more seats were distributed through proportional
representation among four small leftist parties to ensure a minority
voice in the legislature.
   Last week, the PRI formally conceded defeat to the National
Action candidate for governor of Baja California, Ernesto Ruffo.
   Ruffo takes office Nov. 1 for a six-year term.
   ``This is no time to look for blame,'' PRI state coordinator Rene
Trevino Arredondo said in a news release.
   It was the first time the PRI has lost an election for a govenor
or a state legislature since the party was founded in 1929.
   ``We lacked electoral strength among the voters. We have to
accept that,'' Trevino said. ``We must learn from our mistakes so as
not to repeat them, and we must work hard and with a clear strategy
so that what happened in Baja California should not happen
elsewhere.''
   The elections in Baja California and four other states, and a
state election in Durango on Wednesday, were seen as a test of
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's promise to clean up Mexico's
fraud-ridden election system. Salinas' own election in July 1988 was
marred by accusations of irregularities.
   Long delays by election boards in making returns public have
again raised opposition cries of fraud.
   In western Michoacan state, leaders of both the leftist
Democratic Revolutionary Party, National Action, and the PRI filed
protests accusing each other of fraud in at least eight districts.
   In that state, final returns released by the election board
Wednesday showed no clear majority. There was a 12-12 tie between
PRI and the combined opposition in the state legislature.
   According to the returns, the PRI won 12 seats, the Democratic
Revolutionary Party six, National Action two, and the leftist
Authentic Revolutionary and Popular Socialist parties two each.
   The voter turnout was only 28 percent, the election board said.
   PRI easily won the legislative races in Zacatecas and Campeche,
two of its strongholds, and was also expected to win a majority of
the 39 races for mayor and the 15 legislature seats in Durango where
it is also strong.
   Ten more seats are distributed among five minority parties in
proportion to votes received.
   In Durango, most of the state's 1,488 polling stations opened on
schedule at 8 a.m. Workers were given the day off, and turnout was
reported strong among the 709,000 registered voters.
   ``It's a holiday, and all is peaceful,'' said Ruben Cardenas,
editor of Cima, a newspaper in the rural state. ``Only seven polling
stations opened about an hour late because they didn't receive
ballots and other documents on time.''
   National Action hoped to win eight municipal elections.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party said it hoped to win seven
municipal elections. Four other small leftist parties also were
competing.
   The economy of landlocked Durango, where John Huston's film ``The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' was filmed, depends on timber,
mining, farming and cattle ranching.

<HEAD>Yeutter Appears to Open Door for Expanding Drought Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who has
favored limiting drought relief to winter wheat, appeared Wednesday
to open the door to aid farmers of other weather-damaged crops.
   Some southern crops, including rice and cotton, have been
devastated by flooding this year, and drought damage to
spring-planted crops elsewhere in the country is still being
assessed, Yeutter said after a meeting with Senate Republican Leader
Robert Dole and several other GOP senators.
   ``This is a fluid situation and legislation is not being
finalized at this point,'' Yeutter said.
   The Bush administration has threatened to veto a drought relief
package approved by the House that would provide more than $900
million to farmers facing crop losses from severe weather this year.
   Yeutter had agreed with Dole that relief to this year's crops
should be limited to crops planted in 1988 and damaged by drought _
primarily winter wheat. The House measure, and legislation
introduced in the Senate Tuesday by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, would provide assistance for crops planted this
year.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled to vote on drought
legislation next week. In a letter Yeutter sent to the House in
June, he said he would recommend that President Bush sign a drought
relief bill only if it was targeted to ``1989 crops affected by
drought.'' That meant mainly winter wheat, according to an aide.
   Yeutter said Wednesday crops in the South had been severely
damaged by flooding and that drought damage to spring-planted crops
is being assessed ``almost on a day-to-day basis.''
   ``When we first discussed the issues that are involved here the
primary concern was drought. It was basically winter wheat and
livestock producers. In terms of damage that has already occurred
that's still the case with the exception of the severe flooding,''
he said.
   After the meeting with Yeutter, Dole said senators and the
administration were trying to agree on drought legislation that
``takes care of those (farmers) who have a demonstrated loss.'' He
did not elaborate.
   Earlier Wednesday, North Dakota Gov. George Sinner declared a
statewide drought disaster, the first step in making farmers
eligible for federal assistance.
   Sinner said in a statement that he hoped the declaration would
also call attention to North Dakota's plight. A North Dakota State
University study estimates farmers could lose at least $541 million
in small grains and hay crops as a result of a deepening drought.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated the government would
save $950 million in farm program payments to winter wheat growers
because wheat prices are high.
   But Dole's staff said he sees a shrinking ``window of
opportunity'' for funding winter wheat drought aid because the
Agriculture Department is expected to revise those savings downward
_ to between $300 million and $350 million.
   Conrad said the savings will be higher and that spring crop
program payments will provide additional savings.

<HEAD>Nurses' Strike Continues at Pediatric Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nurses walking the picket line outside
northern California's largest pediatric hospital are prepared for a
long strike, and a spokeswoman for the group said Wednesday the
dispute could last for months.
   ``We're prepared to stay out as long as possible to get a
reasonable contract,'' said Susan Cieutat, a member of the
bargaining council of the California Nurses Association.
   ``It could be a week and it could be three months, but most
nurses here have other work,'' said Cieutat of the strike against
Children's Hospital. ``We can afford to stay out a long time.''
   On the second day of the strike, about 25 nurses picketed outside
the hospital, carrying signs that read ``We're Here for the
Children'' and ``Nursing Counts.''
   Hospital officials, too, are ``prepared to take a strike that
will last for a while,'' said spokesman Steve Tiger, adding that
about 30 non-union nurses were working inside the hospital, which is
not accepting new patients.
   A total of 700 nurses walked off their jobs Tuesday after
rejecting by a 4-1 margin the hospital's offer of an 18 percent wage
increase over two years. The nurses want a 26 percent increase over
two years.
   Union officials want salaries to be in a range between $39,400
and $49,100. Children's Hospital nurses now make between $32,000 and
$39,000 and are among the highest paid in the nation. The previous
contract expired June 30.
   No new talks are scheduled.
   The hospital transferred 87 critically ill children from the
195-bed facility to other hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area,
Tiger said. Only 41 children, who are too ill to be moved, remained
at the hospital Wednesday, said Tiger. Fifteen others were released.
   The hospital's pediatric trauma and intensive care units were
closed, although the emergency room remained open and out-patient
services were available, he said.
   Children's Hospital, which was founded in 1912 to serve poor
children, has one of only 14 pediatric trauma centers in the country.

   The army said it attacked a group of Shining
Path guerrillas Wednesday and killed 39 of them, including seven
women, in a major jungle sweep.
   A spokesman for the joint military command in Lima said one
soldier was killed and one wounded in the battle near Ambo, in
Huanuco state, 180 miles northeast of Lima.
   It was the third major operation in a week by the army in the
region, which encompasses much of the Upper Huallaga river valley.
The valley is rich in coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine.
   The military said 75 Shining Path rebels have been killed in the
sweeps, carried out jointly by the army and the air force. Before
Wednesday's battle, only one soldier had been wounded in the
operations.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the army
seized dozens of assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, grenades and
sticks of dynamite in the raid.
   The Shining Path, a Mao-inspired group started by a Marxist
university professor in the early 1970s, took up arms against Peru's
elected government in 1980.
   The nine-year insurgency began in the highland state of Ayacucho,
235 miles southeast of Lima, but has spread through most of the
highlands and northern jungle regions.
   The government has said nearly 15,000 people have been killed,
including soldiers, police, guerrillas and government officials.
Most of the dead have been peasants killed in the cross fire between
the army and the rebels.

   British commuters suffered travel misery Wednesday
for the fourth time in as many weeks with all trains and the city's
subway halted by a 24-hour strike.
   Millions of commuters had to find other ways to work and most
took to the roads, creating huge traffic jams and frazzled nerves.
   It was the fourth nationwide rail strike and the 10th strike on
London's sprawling subway system in 11 weeks. The capital's buses
operated normally.
   A dock strike for job guarantees and walkouts for higher pay by
public service employees at city halls nationwide made things worse.
   The wave of industrial strife is the worst in Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's 10 years in power, despite tough new laws by her
government restricting strikes and outlawing sympathy actions.
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler hinted that new anti-strike
legislation could be introduced by the fall.
   ``You don't suddenly start changing the law in that instant way,
but we have been looking at the law in recent weeks,'' he said.
   After a breakdown in negotiations Tuesday night, state-run
British Rail and leaders of the three rail unions resumed talks with
the help of independent mediators. They later adjourned to let union
leaders hold private discussions.
   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, said he was not hopeful of a speedy settlement. ``There
is a lot of work to be done,'' he said.
   With annual inflation running at 8.3 percent, British Rail raised
its offer of a 7 percent increase to 8.8 percent Tuesday night, but
the unions objected to the strings attached.
   British Rail wants to pay the increase only after all disputes
have ended and to replace national pay bargaining with regional
negotiations. The unions want to make the extra pay retroactive to
April 10 and to retain national bargaining.
   In the other disputes, public services operated by city halls
were paralyzed on the second day of a 48-hour pay strike by nearly
500,000 employees. The strike shut libraries and local tax offices
and hurt care for the handicapped and elderly.
   Port employers claimed a national dock strike was cracking on its
second day, with nearly 1,000 of the country's 9,400 registered dock
workers defying the Transport and General Workers Union by going to
work.
   However, the union stood by its claim that 96 percent of the
workers were on strike and had shut down major ports like Tilbury,
Liverpool and Southampton.

   A woman who suffered several failed pregnancies
had eggs from her ovaries removed and fertilized in vitro, then
frozen, enabling her to have fraternal ``triplets'' born 21 months
apart.
   Jane Mohr of Manhattan Beach, Calif., said in the August issue of
Redbook that she had several ectopic pregnancies that resulted in
the rupture of her Fallopian tubes or required surgery to remove the
fetus. An ectopic pregnancy is when the fetus implants itself in the
tube, rather than the womb.
   On June 26, 1986, Mohr had 10 eggs removed for fertilization with
her husband's sperm after she was given a combination of hormones
called Pergonal to stimulate her ovaries' production of eggs.
   Dr. David R. Meldrum, an in vitro fertilization specialist at
University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center, implanted four
fertilized eggs in Mohr's uterus. On Feb. 15, 1987, she gave birth
to a baby boy after a Caesarean operation.
   In March 1988, Mohr was implanted for the second time with three
embryos from the 1986 fertilization. On Nov. 29, Mohr had two
daughters delivered by Caesarean section.
   The three children developed from separate eggs fertilized by
individual sperm; in scientific terms, they are simply fraternal
siblings _ brother and sisters.
   The process of twinning, which causes multiple births, is the
division of a single, fertilized egg to form two, or three, or more
complete organisms.

<HEAD>Brothers Plead Guilty to Illegal Shipping Military Parts to Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Iranian-born brothers accused of illegally
shipping $1.6 million worth of military parts to Iran through
Savannah, Ga., pleaded guilty Wednesday.
   Mohammad Emamhosseini, also known as John Emam, 42, of Chevy
Chase, and Gholareza Emamhosseini, also known as Reza Emam, 38, of
Rockville, pleaded guilty to one count each of making false
statements on U.S. Customs Service export documents to facilitate
the parts shipments in 1984 and 1985.
   The shipments violated a U.S. embargo on military supplies to
Iran.
   U.S. District Judge Paul V. Niemeyer set sentencing for Sept. 19.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles P. Scheeler said one shipment in
April 1985 led to the federal indictment of the two mean, two of
their other brothers and the Georgia supplier, William Whaley.
   Scheeler said the Emams gave co-defendant Whaley, owner of
Worldwide Military Sales Inc. in Augusta, Ga., an ``Iranian wish
list'' of military supplies Iran needed for its war against Iraq.
   Customs agents seized 22 crates containing 880 embargoed military
truck generators in that shipment.
   The prosecutor said the Emams, who are naturalized U.S. citizens,
made 10 parts shipments to Iran but federal authorities have been
unable to determine the contents of the other shipments.
   The Emam brothers were indicted in Savannah March 8 on two export
conspiracy counts and the false statement charge. Whaley and two
other brothers, Ali and Djalil Emamhosseini, who were partners in
E&amp;S International, were co-defendants in that indictment.
   In bargains with federal prosecutors, John and Reza Emam agreed
to plead guilty in Baltimore, near their homes, to the lesser false
statement felony in return for a government recommendation of
leniency at sentencing.
   Each faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine instead of the 10-year terms and $250,000 fines that
could have been imposed on each of the conspiracy charges had they
been convicted.
   The government also agreed not to prosecute Djalil Emamhosseini.
Ali Emamhosseini died recently of cancer, Scheeler said. Whaley
already has pleaded guilty in the case in Georgia.

   The United Mine Workers extended its
contract-sanctioned work stoppage Wednesday in a move that will keep
about 60,000 coal miners east of the Mississippi off the job the
rest of the week.
   Police made 17 strike-related arrests in Virginia and nine in a
Pittsburgh suburb, and a federal judge refused to order railway
workers to cross UMW picket lines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The extension was intended to give The Pittston Co. time to
respond to Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles' request to resume
negotiations with striking miners, said Howard Green, a UMW
international executive board member.
   ``Our goal is to get people back to work and get it settled,''
Green said.
   Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas was on jury duty this week and has
said he wouldn't consider a meeting with UMW officials until that
obligation is over.
   About 1,900 miners struck Pittston in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky April 5 after working without a contract for 14 months.
Wildcat sympathy strikes by as many as 37,000 miners in the Midwest
and Appalachia began June 12.
   On Monday, the union announced a three-day ``memorial period,''
or cooling-off period, to take about 60,000 miners east of the
Mississippi River off the job. The extension of that work stoppage
runs through Friday.
   The UMW's 1988 contract with the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association allows a memorial period up to 10 days.
   Telephone calls to Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland were not
immediately returned, and Morris Feibusch, BCOA's vice president for
public affairs, refused to comment on the extension.
   Robert Quenon, chief executive officer of the giant Peabody
Holding Co., said he hopes to see hopes to see miners back on the
job at his company's mines soon.
   ``It's taken them an awful long time to get things turned
around,'' he said. ``I hope this two-day extension is about as long
as it takes, and that's about all we have to say on the subject.''
   But some of the 400 UMW members from Appalachia and the Midwest
camping out in Carterton in southwestern Virginia said they had no
plans to end their wildcat strikes next week.
   ``We're going to continue to show our support until some kind of
settlement is reached,'' said Bill Wall of West Frankfort, Ill., who
walked away from his job at Brushy Creek Coal Mine.
   UMW District 17 President Bob Phalen said the memorial period had
eased tension in the coal fields, though state police were reporting
increasing violence.
   ``There's a lot of things in the coal field that have calmed down
in three days, and an additional two days will help calm things even
more,'' Phalen said.
   In Virginia, state troopers made 17 strike-related arrests on
coal-hauling roads, mostly for impeding traffic, said state police
Sgt. Mike Frank.
   In Alabama, police said up to six shots were fired Wednesday at a
coal-loading facility where union miners were harassing non-union
haulers. A shot struck a coal truck, but no injuries were reported,
officers said.
   In the Pittsburgh suburb of Neville Island, Pa., police charged
nine demonstrators with obstructing traffic and disorderly conduct
following a protest in which UMW members blocked entrances to a coke
and iron plant for three hours.
   UMW members said they targeted Shenango Inc. because it is owned
by a family whose Aloe Coal Co. near Imperial, Pa., operates
non-union coal mines.
   In Pittsburgh, U.S. District Judge Donald Ziegler refused to
order 230 Monongahela Railway Co. employees to cross UMW picket
lines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   Some members of the United Transportation Union and the
Transportation Communications Union have refused to work when miners
picket their job sites and to operate trains at night.
   ``Monongahela Railway failed to prove its employees are not in
any immediate danger,'' Ziegler said.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Barry formed Wednesday in the open
Atlantic and carried top winds of 40 mph as it marched slowly
northward, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Barry was near latitude 24.3 north,
longtitude 55.1 west, about 675 miles northeast of the northern
Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.
   Barry, which was moving to the northwest earlier, turned sharply
to the north Wednesday night at 6 mph and posed no threat to land,
said forecaster Hal Gerrish at the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   The storm formed as a depression earlier this week off the
western coast of Africa.
   No important change in strength was expected through Thursday
morning, forecasters said. If Barry gathers sustained winds of 74
mph it would become the first hurricane of the season.
   Tropical Storm Allison, the season's first named storm, caused
widespread flood damage in Texas and Louisiana last month.

   Globetrotting members of Congress took 1,053
overseas trips in 1987-88, some of them ``mere junkets with no
compelling purpose,'' a new study said today.
   Congressional watchdog Public Citizen said the trips cost
taxpayers at least $13.5 million. They included one journey to five
countries by the House Rules Committee, which has no role in
drafting legislation.
   In another trip, 13 House members and seven staffers went to
Australia for seven days to help celebrate the centennial of that
nation's parliament, according to the report, ``Free Flying
Congress.''
   ``There are many valid reasons for members of Congress to travel
at taxpayer expense, but at least some of these trips appear to be
unjustified excursions,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of the
Ralph Nader organization.

   Some National Rifle Association members are
signing petitions to oust President Bush from the organization
because of his decision to ban imports of semiautomatic assault
rifles.
   But the White House says Bush, who last Friday permanently banned
imports of 43 styles of the weapons, has no intention of resigning
his lifetime NRA membership.
   ``The president's a good, solid member of the NRA, always has
been, always will be,'' spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Tuesday.
``We've done nothing that goes against the Second Amendment,'' which
ensures the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.
   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for
Legislative Action, said ``a lot of people are very upset about
this'' because many voted for Bush because of his opposition to gun
control laws.

   Increased concern about violent crime is
producing an unlikely congressional coalition behind a plan to add
100,000 officers to police forces across the country by trading
scholarships for service.
   The idea behind the Police Corps Act of 1989 is to boost the
strength of state and local police forces by up to 22 percent while
creating a new brand of college-educated officers to cope with
racial tensions, gang warfare and other special challenges.
   An unusual group of lawmakers has formed around the bill,
including Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Bob Dornan, R-Calif.
   The outspoken, liberal Frank is rarely on the same side of an
issue with Dornan, an equally combative conservative. ``People who
disagree on 90 percent of the issues agree on 10 percent,'' Frank
said Tuesday.

   House tax-writers, under orders to find an
extra $5.3 billion to reduce the deficit, are casting an eye toward
pipe smokers, telephone users, air travelers and lenders.
   Those groups would pay more tax under a proposal by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee. But most of the three dozen-plus recommendations that he
presented to the panel Tuesday are highly technical changes
affecting few ordinary taxpayers.
   During the budget year that begins Oct. 1, Rostenkowski's plan
would produce just the amount of new revenue envisioned under a
deficit-reduction agreement between Congress and the Bush
administration.
   Although the plan would require various groups to pay more money
to the federal government, apparently no part of it is a general tax
increase that would be viewed as conflicting with President Bush's
pledge to oppose any tax increase.

is winding down his final term trying to draw from a spending well
that has all but run dry.
   The darkest hour is expected Thursday, when Dukakis will announce
$500 million in ``deep and painful cuts'' from a budget just enacted.
   ``Personally, I regret this,'' he said, ``because Thursday is
going to be a dark day in the history of this commonwealth, and it

   He said the spending vetoes will lead to thousands of state
employee layoffs, across-the-board cuts in government and the

   This month's Iranian presidential election
appears a one-horse race dominated by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani and if the Tehran media is anything to go by, the result
is a foregone conclusion.
   A poll published Tuesday by the radical Abrar daily, which has
been critical of Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatist faction in the
past, indicated that 86 percent of Iranians will vote for him in the
July 28 balloting.
   Eleven percent said they would vote for his challenger, former
Agriculture Minister Abbas Sheibani of the Freedom Movement, Iran's
token opposition party.
   Three percent said they would not vote in the election, given
special significance because it comes so soon after the June 3 death
of fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   When Tracy Chapman played her Grammy-winning
song, ``Fast Cars,'' on this year's awards show, she did more than
just herald the return to folk-pop: She championed the acoustic
guitar.
   After a decade or so of synthetic sounds, the acoustic guitar is
making a comeback. The Traveling Wilburys play acoustics while
singing songs off their platinum LP. And Tom Petty's new record is
full of songs written on 6-string and 12-string acoustics.
   Chapman played a Martin guitar _ built by C.F. Martin &amp; Co. in
Nazareth, Pa. It is a handmade instrument constructed with care.
   ``I wrote and thanked her that night,'' said company chairman
Christian F. Martin IV, whose great-great-grandfather founded the
company in 1833.
   At the company's plant, 90 craftsmen carefully perform by hand
the nearly 300 steps necessary to turn Indian rosewood, Amazon
Mahogany and Hawaiian koa into an instrument. Another 100 make the
strings for the instrument.
   The work is time-consuming. The wood is aged up to six months in
the climate-controlled work area. Almost all of the work is done by
hand, with the pearl inlay taking up to two weeks per guitar.
   From start to finish, it takes three months to build a Martin
guitar.
   Most are Dreadnoughts, a widely copied acoustic instrument named
after a class of World War I British battleships.
   ``Ask someone to draw an acoustic guitar and he'll draw a
Dreadnought,'' Martin said.
   The Dreadnought _ which means ``fear nothing'' _ was designed in
1931 by the company for country-western singers who needed a big,
loud guitar. It is pear-shaped, with an extra wide and deep body to
produce a stronger bass and clearer treble.
   The original design is still the most popular, and Martin said 75
percent of the 8,500 instruments made this year at the plant will be
Dreadnoughts.
   This year, the company introduced its first acoustic bass. Priced
between $2,050 and $2,350, the original allotment of 50 intruments
were almost immediately sold out.
   ``We heard Tracy Chapman bought one the first day it was in the
stores,'' Martin said.
   The company now plans on building 350 this year, but even that
won't fill all the orders. ``We can't just crank up production,''
Martin said.
   But most changes do not catch on. Martin Guitar introduced an
acoustic guitar with a polished black finish. It didn't sell because
musicians wanted the natural wood color.
   ``I thought it would fit with some bands who have outlaw
images,'' Martin said. ``The guitar is thousands of years old.
People wouldn't want us to change it much. They want to buy the
guitar their father bought.''
   After a peak year in 1971 _ when Martin produced 22,627
instruments, the market slowly declined. Electronic instruments
became big in the late 1970s, and the nation suffered a recession,
severely damaging business for the country's acoustic guitarmakers.
   Martin's annual sales fell from $18 million to $12 million, and
the company was forced to close factories in Connecticut and New
York, as well as sell subsidiaries in Sweden and a drum company
called Fibes in nearby Easton, Pa. About 330 of 550 employees were
laid off.
   The business started to turn around in 1985, when some musicians
became tired of the electronic instrument sound. Also, the economy
had rebounded enough that people could afford a Martin _ which runs
between $1,000 and $5,000.
   Then came Susanne Vega's folk hit, ``Luka'' in 1987. She received
three Grammy nominations for her song about child abuse. Then came
Chapman's ``Fast Cars,'' a bracing look at inner-city poverty that
won three Grammys.
   Oddly enough, the company's founder, Christian Frederick Martin,
came to the United States in 1833 because guitars were regarded as a
fad in Germany.
   The Martins had been members of the Cabinet Makers Guild, and
when Christian Martin attempted to set up a guitar-making business,
the Violin Makers Guild attempted to stop him.
   ``They said it was just a fad, but they didn't want him to make
the instruments'' Martin said.
   Although he successfully went to court and won the right to
produce guitars, he decided to leave Germany and come to the United
States.
   He began building guitars in New York City, and was an immediate
success.
   ``That's because the guitar is American,'' Martin said. ``When
people were moving out West, what would they play around the
campfire? The guitar. A piano was too big for them to bring along.''
   Tired of the big city, he moved to Nazareth in northeastern
Pennsylvania, where the company has survived through good and bad
times.
   Even in bad times, there will always be a market for a well-made
guitar, said Martin. ``Some artists won't use anything else.''
   Also, many artists who perform on electric guitars actually
compose on acoustics. The Who's Pete Townshend, who uses one on the
band's current reunion tour, mainly writes on acoustic guitars.
   Still, Martin knows that today's acoustic success can be fleeting.
   ``It's a cyclical business. We don't have the clout to change the
direction of music,'' he said.
   But with some trends, such as the electronic instruments in the
1980s, the later models make the earlier ones obsolete. Guitars,
however, can last forever.
   ``Acoustic instruments get better with time,'' Martin said. ``The
day you buy a guitar is the worst it will sound.''

<HEAD>Politics and Pay Raises</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas S. Foley knows a political trap when he
sees one _ he didn't become speaker of the House by walking into
them.
   So there will be no new pay raise debate in the
Democrat-controlled House unless and until Republicans sign on
enthusiastically, and declare the issue off limits politically.
   Foley wants more than an endorsement of government pay raises
from President Bush; he says the administration will have to be
solidly and actively behind the measure. And he says that
endorsement is going to have to be binding on the Republicans'
national political committees as well as the White House.
   ``There has to be absolute bipartisanship,'' Foley, D-Wash., said.
   For good measure, the speaker said there will have to be solid
support in the Democratic Senate, too, before the House takes on the
issue of congressional pay again. In the past, the Senate sometimes
has had a free political ride on the issue, voting against pay
raises while anticipating House action _ or inaction _ that would
put them into effect.
   It didn't work this year. The House did vote, spurred by public
protests against a 51 percent pay raise that was due to take effect
Feb. 8, and rejected the increase. In the process, raises for top
executive branch officials and for federal judges also were scrapped.
   So congressional salaries stayed at $89,500 a year, with senators
and representatives still entitled to supplement them with the
widely criticized practice of accepting speechmaking and similar
fees. Judicial and executive pay stayed put, too, since the
22-year-old pay raise system was based on a package deal.
   That provides the hook in the terms Foley set for action on a
federal pay raise. While the speaker said he personally opposes
tying judicial and executive raises to an increase in congressional
pay, a House majority would not vote to pry them apart.
   Bush has proposed pay raises of up to 25 percent for judges and
top executive branch officials. He also recommended that Congress
phase out its honoraria, cutting the ceilings by 50 percent on Jan.
1, 1990, and banning those payments entirely a year later. That is
supposed to be be done in tandem with a congressional pay raise.
Bush did not specifically propose one, but said he would work with
Congress toward that end.
   That doesn't match the administration commitment Foley suggested
at a luncheon with executives and reporters of The Associated Press.
   Two weeks before he left office, President Reagan approved the 51
percent pay raises recommended by a government salary commission.
After his inauguration Bush seconded that, but with faint praise. He
said he didn't think he should undo Reagan's decision.
   Under the salary commission system, dating from 1967, pay
recommendations took effect with presidential approval unless both
houses of Congress voted to reject them within 30 days. This time,
both houses did, after former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, scrapped
plans to let it take effect Feb. 8 and put pay to a vote.
   A bipartisan House panel on compensation and ethics is
considering the problem now. It is likely to recommend an increase
coupled with sharp restrictions on outside income. Foley said he
wants to see its recommendations before deciding on the next step.
   Foley said any new pay raise proposal will have to be reasonable,
with political support spanning the parties, and with no revival of
the public outcry that was urged on by talk show hosts and others in
the media last winter. He said some people in the news media
distorted that issue. He also acknowledged that the 51 percent
proposal was too high, but said that in recommending it the pay
commission really was concerned about boosting the compensation of
federal judges and wasn't thinking about Congress.
   During that first round, most Republicans stayed out of the way
and let Wright and his Democrats take the heat. Even though two
Republican presidents had endorsed the raise, the Republican
National Committee sent out _ and then withdrew _ a fund-raising
letter which complained there was ``a move afoot to let congressmen
enjoy yet another whopping pay raise.''
   Foley wants a guarantee against that political tactic. ``That's
unacceptable, that sort of good-cop, bad-cop routine,'' he said.
   Outside of Congress, congressional pay raises never are popular.
The assurances Foley seeks would insure that the branches and the
parties share the blame. After all, senators or representative,
Republican or Democrat, the pay's the same.

<HEAD>Court Decisions Stir Melange Of Religious Reactions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potpourri of reactions has swirled through
religious circles to recent Supreme Court decisions on abortion,
executions, holiday displays and the flag.
   Views were about as mixed in the religious household as in
society at large.
   One odd situation found Jewish leaders upset because the court
had approved displaying a Jewish symbol. Regarding the flag,
President Bush ignited conflicting religious reactions for wanting
new laws to shield it.
   Such a constitutional amendment or legislation is needed, said
the Knights of Columbus, to remove the court's inference that
burning or otherwise abusing the flag is an ``acceptable form of
protest.''
   The Roman Catholic fraternal order noted its stress on patriotism
education in backing measures to ``save the flag from desecration.''
   On the other hand, the general synod last week of the United
Church of Christ said such legislation would ``exalt'' the flag
beyond a ``treasured symbol'' of America and restrict the very
freedom the flag symbolizes.
   Similarly, the American Jewish Committee said such legislation
would erode the First Amendment which ``protects the freedom of all
of us,'' including ``even crazy people who see fit to burn the
American flag.''
   The court's upholding of the death penalty for 16- and
17-year-olds and the moderately retarded was denounced by
Protestant, Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders.
   It is ``an outrage'' that must be changed, said the Rev. Thom
White Wolf Fassett, head of the United Methodist Board of Church and
Society. It called the decision ``reprehensible'' to ``people of
faith.''
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, terming capital punishment
itself a poor way to deter crime, said he is ``disappointed and
saddened'' by the court decision allowing that penalty for minors
and the retarded.
   The AJC said it ``is appalled'' by the decision, adding that
capital punishment ``degrades and brutalizes'' society and becomes a
``mockery of justice'' in executing the young and retarded.
   A total of 30 youths, all younger than 18 when they committed
murders, now are on death row, and the courts have estimated about a
fifth of nearly 2,200 others awaiting execution are retarded to some
degree.
   The abortion decision evoked the most voluminous and diverse
reactions, far more sweeping than the decision itself.
   Explicitly it held only that Missouri could prohibit state-based
hospitals and personnel from performing abortions. Other aspects
remained ambiguous. Previously, Congress itself had barred federal
funds for abortion.
   Neverthless, the impact was thunderous, on both sides, one
denouncing the decision as an assault on women's rights, and the
other saying it signaled a turn toward protecting the unborn.
   It is ``the beginning of the opportunity to end this dark night
of our nation's soul in which so terribly many of the most
defenseless among us, our unborn, have been denied the right to
life,'' said the Rev. Richard D. Land, head of the Southern Baptist
Christian Life Commission.
   The decision is ``a victory for life'' and the biggest winners
``are the tiniest people of all _ children within the womb,'' said
Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   However, some Jewish and Protestant leaders decried the decision
as threatening women's rights.
   ``The ruling is a deplorable attack on the religious freedom of
all Americans,'' said officials of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, vowing to oppose any state attempts to limit free
choice in abortion.
   United Methodism's social-concerns executive, Fassett, said the
court had turned the clock back 20 years on women's right to choose
abortion and the rulings ``are highly discriminatory,'' putting the
heaviest burden on the poor.
   However, the Rev. James Heidinger, executive of the
denomination's evangelical caucus, hailed the decision as ``a
clearly positive one.''
   Thus, within denominations, as within the nation, feelings were
divided on an issue which remained about as unsettled as ever.
   The court's curiously two-way ruling on religious displays in
Pittsburgh, banned a Christmas creche (cradle scene) in a courthouse
lobby, but approved a Hanukkah menorah (candelabrum) on the outside.
   Remarkably, Jewish leaders deplored the decision favoring their
own symbol, which the court said was acceptable because it was
religiously neutral and stood near a secular Christmas tree.
   The decision ``will further hasten the transformation of Hannukah
from a religious to a cultural event,'' lamented Phil Baum,
associate director of the American Jewish Congress.
   ``This is the inevitable price paid for seeking to enlist
official endorsement for religious practices.''
   The AJC, saying the court would better have ruled out both the
creche and menorah, added, ``There is simply no religious need for
the display of sacred symbols of any faith in or at government
buildings.''
   On the other hand, Michael Novak, Roman Catholic lay scholar of
the American Enterprise Institute, said the court is demanding a
blanket kind of secularism contrary to America's characteristic
religious nature.

   Although stressing that it's an exception
and not normal practice, Youngstown's Catholic Bishop James W.
Malone has approved celebrations of the old Latin Mass on six
occasions in his diocese this summer.
   The action was in response to 135 letters requesting it.
   It provides for specific afternoon Masses in July and August at
chapels of several parishes in Canton, Ohio, for persons who had
asked for services in the Tridentine Mass, as used before English in
the liturgy became customary..
   The Rev. Bradford Helman, diocesan vicar for worship, emphasized
that regular parish Masses would remain in English. He said a
recently formed group, Ecclesias Dei, based in Glenview, Ill., has
misrepresented that the Tridentine Mass is the will of the pope.
   Deploring such confusion, Helman said ``the Tridentine Mass by
the typical Mass-goer is neither the will of the Holy Father nor the
agenda for the contemporary church.''

   Calling the step in the new ``spirit of glasnost,'' Rabbi Albert
Lewis, RA president, said it presaged ``a new resurgency of Eastern
European Jewry decimated at the hands of Nazism.''
   The only recognized rabbinic seminary in Eastern Europe, the

<TEXT>
   Kay Lenz's problem as a police psychologist in
``Murder By Night'' on the USA Network is that Robert Urich is the
only witness to the murder and he can't remember a thing.
   An even bigger complication is she's falling in love with him and
at the same time is becoming suspicious that he's the killer.
   ``He has amnesia and she's trying to get him to remember,'' said
Lenz. ``He doesn't know who he is but everything points to the fact
that he's a wealthy but reclusive restaurant owner. We go through
his things trying to jog his memory.''
   ``Murder By Night,'' which will be seen next Wednesday, is part
of a package of 24 original motion pictures for USA World Premiere
Movie on the cable channel.
   Lenz plays Karen Hicks, a police officer and psychologist, Urich
is Allan Strong, a man without a past who's found at the scene of a
murder, and Michael Ironside is Detective Lt. Carl Madsen, Karen's
former husband. Paul Lynch directed on location in To do come to find out
that Allan is not who
we think he is.''
   Lenz said that because Toronto was standing in for New York in
the movie the production company had to take its own garbage along
on location filming.
   ``Toronto is a very clean city,'' she said. ``We took the garbage
with us in bags and would scatter it around. After filming, they'd
clean it up and take it to the next location.''
   Lenz has been in about six movies in the past three years, but
said before that she had been in a slump.
   ``It happened when I was getting divorced from David Cassidy,''
she said. ``I was in a movie with James Woods called `Fast-Walking.'
After that I didn't work for 2{ years. It happens, you know. You
wake up one day and say, `I haven't worked for a year.' ...
   ``Without the support and love of family and friends I might not
have made it.''
   Wha broke the slump was a call to do an episode of ``Insight,''
the television series produced by Paulist Productions.
   ``It's done by the Catholic Church and most people donate their
salaries,'' she said. ``I was so broke that when they gave me the
check I said, `I'm so sorry. I can't give it back.' After that I did
episodes of `Hotel' and `Simon &amp; Simon' and then some movies.''
   She made her movie debut as a teen-age hippie in ``Breezy'' in
1973, which starred William Holden and was directed by Clint
Eastwood. On television, she starred in the 1976 miniseries ``Rich
Man, Poor Man'' and in the regular series spinoff later that year.
She was in 13 episodes of ``The Monroes'' and in the short-lived
``Tammy Grimes Show.''
   Lenz grew up in Hollywood and made her first TV appearance when
she was six weeks old.
   ``My father was Ted Lenz, who was a very famous local
announcer,'' she said. ``He was the king of the hard sell and I did
many commercials with him. I remember once I came in to do a
commercial for a swimming pool. I was about 5 and my memory is that
I refused to do it and never did another one.''

money in certain ways and re-allocate it to newsgathering,'' said
Peggy Hubble, network director of news information.
   The network will reduce the number of polls it conducts and in
some cases use outside contractors for field work and data
collection, she said. NBC, which does some of its polling with The
Wall Street Journal, will expand its polling division prior to
elections and at other times when it feels an increase is needed,
she said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With interest rates falling and stock prices
rising, mutual-fund investors would seem to have a lot to applaud
and little to complain about so far in 1989.
   Funds in nearly all categories of style and objective have posted
robust gains since the start of the year, helping to push echoes of
the 1987 crash into distant memory.
   An index of growth stock funds calculated by Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. reached a record high just a few weeks ago, having
recouped all its 1987 losses and then some.
   Bond and other income funds, meanwhile, have rallied sharply of
late as falling interest rates pushed up the prices of the assets in
their portfolios.
   For the first half of the year, according to Lipper, stock and
other equity mutual funds averaged a return of 12.75 percent.
   Fixed-income funds returned a less-imposing 6.92 percent. But
nearly all of that increase came in April, May and June after
interest rates started their descent, holding out the promise of
more good news should rates keep falling in the months ahead.
   About the only two blots on the bright overall picture occurred
in gold-oriented funds, which have been lagging for some time, and
international funds.
   In the eyes of many analysts, the weak showing of the gold funds
betokened an absence of fears about inflation and other economic
calamities that historically tend to drive up the price of gold.
   International funds suffered as the dollar rallied against other
leading currencies in foreign exchange markets.
   The dollar was in demand, for a change, since it appeared that
the U.S. economy was heading for a relatively benign ``soft
landing'' while other major industrialized countries struggled with
increasing inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   In other words, even the poor performance of a few specialized
sectors of the fund industry reflected seemingly favorable news for
the overall U.S. investment outlook.
   So what could trouble a fund investor these days? First of all,
there are those nagging doubts that positive results will be as easy
to come by in the future as they have been in the recent past.
   The equity funds' gain the first half, stretched out to an annual
rate, works out to about 31 percent, noted A. Michael Lipper,
president of Lipper Analytical. That's at least twice the historical
average.
   Or to put it another way, the funds could achieve no progress at
all in the second half and still wind up 1989 with results as good
as they have shown in an average year in the past.
   Then, too, there's the question of relative fund performance as
measured against a standard such as Standard &amp; Poor's composite
index of 500 stocks.
   The first-half gain by the average fund fell short of the 16.52
percent advance posted by the S&amp;P 500, assuming reinvestment of
dividends.
   To veteran fund investors this news is no shock. Over time, in a
world of hundreds of funds, logic suggests that the typical fund
cannot beat the market.
   Furthermore, the funds' results are held back by expenses and
management fees that are charged against their assets. As a
theoretical, unmanaged ``portfolio,'' the S&amp;P 500 incurs no such
costs.
   If you can't buy the S&amp;P 500, you can buy shares in an index
mutual fund set up to duplicate its performance as closely as
possible while minimizing costs.
   By its very nature, an index fund will never achieve No. 1 status
in the fund performance rankings, just as it will never finish at
the back of the pack.
   But over the past 12 months, observes Norman Fosback, editor of
the advisory publication Mutual Fund Forecaster, ``index funds beat
better than 80 percent of their competitors.''

<HEAD>The Beatles, Beethoven and Joe Jackson</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When The Beatles released their classic ``Sgt.
Pepper'' album in the summer of 1967, Joe Jackson wasn't paying
attention; he was too busy learning Beethoven.
   By the album's 20th anniversary, however, Jackson was an
established rock star, preparing material for his next record.
   All the talk about ``Sgt. Pepper'' got him thinking about his own
life over the past two decades.
   He was born in 1955 in Portsmouth, England, and taught himself
classical piano, later attending the Royal Academy of Music. By the
late 1970s, he was one of many young musicians inspired by the punk
movement and released a pair of hard-edged, satiric albums, ``Look
Sharp'' and ``I'm the Man.''
   ``When I wrote those `Look Sharp' songs,'' Jackson recalled, ``I
was 21, 22, and very inspired by early punk. I wanted to strip
everything down to the basics and make some high energy music,
guitar, bass and drums. I was trying to write decent songs at the
same time, not just trash.''
   But Jackson wanted to record in a variety of styles. He released
an album of '40s blues and swing, ``Jumpin' Jive,'' and used
shadings of jazz and salsa on ``Body and Soul'' and ``Night and
Day.''
   ``It's becoming more and more apparant that we have something
here that doesn't have to be governed by any rules,'' he said. ``We
can do what we like with that. There's a lot of things about rock
'n' roll other than youth and rebellion and being 19 and looking
cool.''
   Jackson ended up writing 12 songs for his new album, ``Blaze of
Glory,'' a collection of rockers and ballads that has the orchestral
feel of ``Sgt. Pepper,'' and serves musically and lyrically as a
miniautobiography.
   He starts the record with the wide-eyed ``Big New World,'' in
which a young boy imagines an unlimited future.
   ``I sort of grew up reading science fiction comic books,'' the
34-year-old Jackson recalled. ``We were watching the moon landing on
TV and thinking it was all going to come true.''
   Eleven songs and 20 years later, Jackson is ready to settle for
simpler pleasures with ``The Human Touch.'' Dreams of conquering the
world have given way to a simple wish for intimacy.
   ``You have to adjust,'' Jackson said. ``Everything is going to
change as you get older and you have to constantly adjust.
Unfortunately, we have such a youth-obsessed culture that people
can't see the positive side of that. ''
   In between, Jackson sings of youth culture (``Rant and Rave,''
``Nineteen Forever''), the superpowers (``Evil Empire'') and a
London that no longer swings (``Down to London'').
   The music combines rock, pop, jazz and swing.
   ``You hear a certain lack of consensus, now _ a lack of style of
the times,'' he said. ``There are no rules. There's no such thing as
rock 'n' roll or pop music anymore; there are a zillion different
kinds of music.
   Jackson has matured as a singer as well. His vocals on ``Blaze of
Glory'' are relaxed and light, in contrast to his earlier records,
where he affects a harsh tone.
   ``I didn't realize you could actually hold back a bit and still
be OK,'' he said. ``You just sort of got up and screamed your lungs
out because it was going to be exciting and you were going to show
everyone you meant it. You realize there are other ways of doing
it.''
   He sings of rock stars who died young, such as Buddy Holly and
Eddie Cochran, on the title track, and uses lyrics from classic
songs _ Buffalo Springfield's ``For What It's Worth,'' The Who's
``Won't Get Fooled Again'' _ throughout the record.
   ``I don't think it's silly at all to still like those songs,''
Jackson said. ``The only thing silly to me is people who think it's
the same way, trying to depend that 20 years haven't gone by.''
   ``Sgt. Pepper'' was the first rock album referred to widely as
art, a dangerous term for music that began as rebellion against
pretension and snobbery. Jackson sees it as a positive development.
   ``I think that comes from people having the wrong idea about art
rather than the wrong idea of rock 'n' roll. There's nothing elitist
or pretentious about art. Tha arts in the 20th century have been a
process of democratization _cinema, jazz and rock 'n' roll.
   ``You can call it what you like, but there's no doubt in my mind
that what I'm doing is art and I'm an artist. Of course I'm an
artist. What am I going to say, I'm a plumber?''

<HEAD>Insurance Storm Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cost issues in insurance seem to erupt on a
regular basis, accompanied by rising rates, angry responses from
state insurance commissioners and threats by companies to drop out
of the business.
   While the issues seem to develop as suddenly as a summer
thunderstorm, usually they have simmered for many months within the
industry or between the industry and insurance commissioners.
   The beginning of one such issue could be right now. Workers'
compensation insurance seems to be getting out of control. Claims
are soaring, and a study of the industry suggests profits have just
about disappeared.
   ``The system is being overused,'' says Robert A. Brian, whose
study is now being circulated among property and casualty insurers.
``We either control the benefits,'' he says, ``or I see no reason
for insurers to continue writing.''
   Brian isn't an insurer, but he knows the industry thoroughly
since he is senior vice president of Conning &amp; Co., a Hartford-based
securities firm that specializes in insurance companies. He is
responsible for all its research.
   In 1989, he estimates the entire industry will write $28.4
billion of premiums and pay out $26.8 billion, leaving a balance of
$1.6 billion. That is, payouts will amount to about 94 percent of
the money taken in.
   To the uninitiated that might not seem too bad, but if you look
back in Brian's statistical sheets you'll see that in 1982 the
percentage was only 73.5. But that, he points out, is only the
beginning of the story.
   When deductions are made for administrative expenses, inflation
and dividends paid to policyholders, says Brian, the industry will
end the year having paid out $1.20 for every dollar collected.
That's not good business.
   Yes, but the companies will have had the use of billions of
dollars during the year, and that should provide them with
investment income. True, said Brian. It will bring them back to the
break-even point. That is, zero return.
   He suggests that with no return on capital, companies aren't
likely to persist very long in writing this essential form of
insurance, which reimburses employees for lost income and medical
costs.
   As he sees it, the benefits system has to be controlled. Viewing
a graph of benefits paid since 1975 gives the impression of a spiral
winding up for a bust. Claims totaled $5.2 billion in 1975; in 1988,
an estimated $23.9 billion.
   The issue of who will pay _ employers or insurers _ is important,
but it probably isn't the bigger problem. Potentially larger is how
to save a system whose users seem to be imposing a steadily higher
burden on it.
   Many factors are involved. Theoretically, says Brian, you could
point to several economic factors, such as the size of the work
force, wage inflation and medical inflation.
   You might also point the finger at legislated benefits increases,
including the broadening view of what constitutes a compensable
claim.
   He discounts the possibility of these being the main factors. In
fact, he calls attention to a decline over recent years in the
pressure exerted by state legislatures. The main reason, he says, is
system overuse.
   To offer that explanation is perhaps to invite inquiry into
sociological factors, but somehwere in that area are some answers.
Whatever the reason, relief is needed or a crisis could develop.
   Insurers have a reputation, sometimes applied scornfully, of
watching every penny. Some might seek to cut their own expenses, but
failing in that area they seem likely to raise rates. And that's
when the storm breaks.

<TEXT>
   The San Luis Valley, a desert averaging 7
inches of rain a year, may be sitting on one of the continent's
largest aquifers.
   Far from easing competition over water, though, the prospect of a
vast underground water supply has triggered a battle over how the
precious resource should be developed, and by whom.
   ``The San Luis Valley aquifer probably has more water in it than
the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water for several major
agricultural states,'' said Maurice Strong, founder and chairman of
American Water Development Inc.
   ``It's the first time I've seen the people of this valley get
together and fight something,'' said retired water division engineer
H.D. McFadden. ``That's because it's an outsider coming in here to
take our water.''
   The outsider in question is Denver-based American Water, which
wants to drill 97 wells on its 155,000-acre Baca Grant Ranch and
pump as much as 200,000 acre-feet a year from the aquifer, or
slightly more than 6.5 billion gallons. An acre-foot is enough water
to cover one acre a foot deep.
   In a December 1986 application, the company said it wanted the
water for ``ranch uses'' and agricultural projects. When pressed by
nervous residents, it admitted it eventually would sell the water to
thirsty cities like Denver.
   Company officials say the development will benefit the valley,
however, creating jobs and encouraging new industries. The company
maintains in its application that the aquifer is so big it can
support current claims plus new projects.
   ``It's a very major resource for the valley and for us,'' said
Strong, who insisted he was speaking as an interested individual,
not company chairman.
   The venture is opposed by virtually everyone with a stake in the
valley's current water-rights system. The case could be heard as
early as this fall in Division Three water court, a specialized
state court, in Alamosa.
   The San Luis Valley, where a mere 41,000 people are scattered
across 8,200 square miles, gets its water from the Rio Grande and
its tributaries, and from underground water that runs off the San
Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains.
   The complex system of water rights revolves around the Closed
Basin Project, a federal project begun in the 1970s to help Colorado
meet obligations to New Mexico and Texas under the Rio Grande
Compact of 1939.
   The project is a network of shallow wells and pipelines that
lower the water table to prevent evaporation and pump about 100,000
acre-feet a year into lakes and wildlife refuges and into the Rio
Grande. It covers 2,900 square miles of Alamosa and Saguache
counties, including a corner of the Baca Ranch where streams don't
run into the Rio Grande.
   The Rio Grande Water Conservation District, which sponsors the
Closed Basin and represents water users in five of the six valley
counties, has led a costly court opposition. It had to more than
double its millage levy in December 1987.
   Other opponents include the state Division of Wildlife and Water
Conservation Board and the federal bureaus of Land Management and
Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife and National Parks services.
They are concerned about the effects of American Water's plan on the
Closed Basin Project and some marshes in the valley that are home to
endangered waterfowl.
   The company cites a U.S. Geological Survey finding that the
aquifer holds 2 billion acre-feet of water _ about the same as the
Ogallala Aquifer. It also argues that the water under Baca Ranch is
non-tributary _ meaning its levels would not affect water levels in
the rest of the valley.
   Rio Grande district Manager Ralph Curtis said the plan could
deplete as much as 38 percent of the Closed Basin Project's water.
And a recent study by the San Luis Valley Water Conservation
District says much of the aquifer water may not be recoverable; it
could be alkaline or otherwise contaminated.
   McFadden said the valley's hydrology still is little known, but
evidence suggests all the water beneath it is connected. Taking
200,000 acre-feet at the Baca could lower the water table below many
existing wells, he said.
   Opponents also reject a claim by American Water that the state
has no jurisdiction over the water because Baca Ranch was a Spanish
land grant subject to Spanish law.
   The company offered in November to drop its application if
opponents would withdraw as well and agree to cooperate on more
aquifer studies.
   David Robbins, the district's attorney, said his clients ``are

<HEAD>Episcopal Uprising Seen Tempered by Special Arrangements</HEAD>

   As the dust clears, an uprising in the Episcopal
Church over women priests and lately a woman bishop appears to be
settling into a working, though edgy, adjustment.
   Keen differences still exist between church policy affirming
women's ordination and opponents of it. But earlier indications of
breakup have given way to stopgap accommodation.
   The modus vivendi has emerged, on both sides, in the wake of a
June gathering of nearly 2,000 Episcopalian traditionalists, who
were summoned to organize resistance to women in the clergy.
   The protesters decided, after initial harsh talk of rupture, that
they would try to stick with the denomination through some special
arrangements. The church's leadership seemed responsive.
   ``I believe that there are ways we can not only stay together but
enrich one another,'' says the Most Rev. Edmond L. Browning,
presiding bishop of the 2.5 million-member denomination.
   Asked about the implications of the large meeting of
traditionalists in Fort Worth, Texas, he said he has ``a great deal
of hope.''
   Similarly optimistic reactions came from the dissident camp.
   ``We can live together,'' said retired Fort Worth Bishop A.
Donald Davies, who was elected executive director of the new
Episcopal Synod of America, which was organized by the meeting to
stay in the denomination yet help traditionalist parishes.
   ``We could have separated if we'd have pursued that course, but
I'm glad we didn't,'' Davies said in a telephone interview. ``We
want to be the church in the church and work with fellow bishops to
provide a comprehensive ministry.''
   Browning, who has strongly supported women in the priesthood,
said ``there is not only a place'' in the church for those opposing
that position but ``what they bear witness to is needed for the
health of the whole body.''
   ``Without them we would be a weaker church,'' he said.
   He said the threat to the church ``comes not from people who call
themselves `traditionalists''' but ``from superheated rhetoric that
polarizes people.''
   ``I am working, as are others, to keep the climate one where
people can hear each other and not become polarized. We are working
for openness and a spirit of respect and courtesy,'' Browning said.
   The Fort Worth meeting was triggered by the Massachusetts
diocese's election to the episcopate last fall of a woman, now
Suffragan Bishop Barbara Harris. The session started out in a
bitter, defiant mood, but gradually mellowed.
   ``Originally some wanted to leave'' the denomination, Davies
said, but bishops of the Evangelical and Catholic Mission, the
sponsoring group of traditionalists, ``were determined if possible
to stay within the church.''
   ``I'm very pleased we didn't get into angry reaction,'' he said,
adding that in the end ``a sense of unity and harmony prevailed,''
recognizing that maintaining it necessitates room for diversity.
   The meeting adopted a plan for ``Episcopal Visitors'' _ bishops
of traditionalist views from outside a diocese _ to handle episcopal
duties such as confirmations in traditionalist congregations that
ask for it.
   Such arrangements, requiring permission of the diocesan bishop
involved, were approved by the church's 1988 convention. The
requests have to be channeled through Browning, the presiding bishop.
   An international commission of the worldwide Anglican Communion,
which comprises the Episcopal Church and 26 other national branches
totaling about 70 million members, sanctioned such special
arrangements.
   Six of the 27 branches have authorized women priests, although
not the ``mother church'' of England, thus producing varying
practices worldwide.
   Asked what would occur if a diocesan bishop declined to approve
an ``Episcopal Visitor'' in an area where a traditionalist
congregation wanted one, Davies said, ``We hope that doesn't
happen.''
   However, he added, ``if we ask for permission to come in, and get
a negative response, and if after asking the presiding bishop to
intervene, the answer still is `no,' we might feel compelled to go
in anyhow.''
   That would violate canonical provisons regarding episcopal acts
in neighboring dioceses, and presumably could lead to formal rifts
or schism.
   ``If there is no cooperation whatsoever, we probably would go in
without it,'' Davies said. ``If we didn't, the traditionalist
congregation would be cut off.''
   However, he said he felt the system was a ``basis for reconciling
differences.'' He said that Browning in conversations ``has given
his assurance of a place for traditionalists.''
   ``He will make sure of it,'' Davies said. ``It fits his pattern
of leadership. He has taken the issue seriously and the people that
raised it seriously.''
   Traditionalists also have opposed the church's revised prayerbook
of 1979, but Davies said ``it's now pretty well accepted,'' mainly
because an extended option allowed for using it or the old 1928
version.
   Asked if it were possible traditionalists eventually would accept
women priests in a church that now has 1,200 women among 14,000
clergy, Davies said:
   ``It's always a possiblity. But it's a different kind of issue.
It would break with a 2,000-year tradition of an undivided church.''

   Hungarian and Czechoslovakian rabbis have agreed
to affiliate formally with the Rabbinical Assembly in what it calls
the beginning of renewal of Jewish life in Eastern Europe.
   The Assembly is the international, mostly American body of
Conservative rabbis, the middle-ground branch between Reform and
Orthodox Judaism.
   Calling the step in the new ``spirit of glasnost,'' Rabbi Albert
Lewis, RA president, said it presaged ``a new resurgency of Eastern
European Jewry decimated at the hands of Nazism.''
   The only recognized rabbinic seminary in Eastern Europe, the
Jewish Theological School of Budapest, has graduated about 75 rabbis
since World War II and a number of cantors.
   Discussions were planned for a fuller exchange of educational
materials and teachers.

   Although stressing that it's an exception
and not normal practice, Youngstown's Catholic Bishop James W.
Malone has approved celebrations of the old Latin Mass on six
occasions in his diocese this summer.
   The action was in response to 135 letters requesting it.
   It provides for specific afternoon Masses in July and August at
chapels of several parishes in Canton, Ohio, for persons who had
asked for services in the Tridentine Mass, as used before English in
the liturgy became customary..
   The Rev. Bradford Helman, diocesan vicar for worship, emphasized
that regular parish Masses would remain in English. He said a
recently formed group, Ecclesias Dei, based in Glenview, Ill., has
misrepresented that the Tridentine Mass is the will of the pope.
   Deploring such confusion, Helman said ``the Tridentine Mass by
the typical Mass-goer is neither the will of the Holy Father nor the
agenda for the contemporary church.''

   The name fits.
   Out of nowhere the New Kids on the Block have hit the streets to
claim the No. 1 spot on the Billboard singles chart with their
ballad ``I'll Be Loving You (Forever).''
   They're the hottest teen group to come along since the Jacksons,
the Osmonds, The Jets, Menudo and New Edition.
   The New Kids on the Block include brothers Jordan and Jonathan
Knight, Danny Wood, Joe McIntyre and Donnie Wahlberg. They range in
age from 16 to 19.
   The success is mind-boggling to the self-described ``street
kids'' from Boston.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Jonathan, 19, with a typical
teen-age giddiness. ``The odds of this actually happening are
astronomical. We're so lucky.''
   But the New Kids groan at the mention of the Osmond comparison or
any other association with teen ``bubblegum'' music. In fact, their
music is a little bit of everything.
   ``I just think the bubblegum label _ for any group _ is an
insult. It's like teens don't have the right to make music that's
good and appealing to other teens,'' said Donnie, 19.
   Donnie admits, however, the quintet's first album, ``New Kids on
the Block,'' might have seemed youthful. ``As we grow up, our music
will grow up, too,'' he said.
   Their second album, ``Hangin' Tough,'' has sold more than 1
million copies and spawned two other Top 10 singles, ``Please Don't
Go Girl'' and ``You've Got It (The Right Stuff).''
   They recently taped a segment of ``Kid's Choice,'' an award show
for the cable TV channel Nickelodeon, at Universal Studios. The
group performed its next single, ``Hangin' Tough.''
   Like The Jets and Osmonds, the New Kids are as squeaky clean as
their image. They are well-dressed and well-mannered. They attend
classes during the school year, and they brag about having never
done drugs _ a rarity in a business full of raucous rock bands and
recovering substance abusers.
   ``I think our success gives other kids role models, positive role
models, because we don't do drugs or things like that. I think
that's important,'' said Jordan, 18.
   In honor of their anti-drug stance, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis proclaimed April 24, 1989, ``New Kids on the Block Day.''
   The sudden rise to fame hasn't jaded them. They were still
excited about being taped for a television show, and likewise
starstruck at all the celebrities they're getting to meet on their
way up.
   ``I just met Alyssa Milano!'' said Joe, 16, referring to the
teen-age co-star of ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   ``It's not like a job. Right now we're just having a whole lot of
fun,'' he said.
   The fun includes gathering mostly teen-age fans all over the
country. The group estimates their average fan is female and ranges
in age from 12 to 16.
   The New Kids were discovered in Boston by producer Maurice Starr,
who staged a citywide search in 1984 to create a band such as New
Edition, which he also put together.
   At first, the quintet focused on rap and rhythm and blues, but
weren't satisfied with the minor success the first album achieved.
So they widened their musical style and honed their dance steps.
   For now, the boys are concentrating on developing their vocal
prowess, and sing much like a polished street corner group. But in
the future they plan to start working more with their own
instruments and incorporating them on albums and in performances.
   They have toured the United States off and on since last summer,
opening in some cities for Tiffany, another teen singer.
   The group's next project is an album called ``Merry Merry
Christmas,'' due for release in the fall. The record contains
traditional holiday fare such as ``White Christmas,'' and more
modern originals such as ``A Funky Funky Christmas.''
   As for the Kids, they're loving every busy minute, but can't say
the same for their parents.
   ``It's like the grass is always greener on the other side. Our
parents wanted us to make it really bad, but now they kinda miss
us,'' said Donnie.

   Two of this summer's hottest sequels,
``Ghostbusters II'' and ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' have received boosts
from supporting players who never really wanted the parts.
   Surrounded by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver,
Peter MacNicol steals the movie as the villainous word-mangling art
restorer, Janosz Poha, in ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Joe Pesci, as the troublesome but lovable Leo Getz, fits right in
with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the high-powered stars of ``Lethal
Weapon 2.''
   But neither MacNicol or Pesci initially wanted the part.
   Why would McNicol, an accomplished theater performer and featured
player in the acclaimed film ``Sophie's Choice,'' want to switch
from Shakespeare to slime? After reading the script, he called his
agent and told him to forget it.
   Pesci enjoyed the comic police thriller ``Lethal Weapon,'' but
never imagined adding himself to the sure-fire team of Gibson and
Glover. When his agent advised him a funny part was available in the
sequel, Pesci was skeptical. After all, he was better known for
playing tough guys in ``Raging Bull'' and ``Once Upon a Time in
America.''
   But both actors reconsidered.
   What impressed MacNicol about ``Ghostbusters II'' was the name,
``Vigo of Carpathia,'' the evil spirit that haunts the film. His
mind quickly filled in details.
   ``I thought, `What can I do with this Carpathia connection? Why
does this art restorer know so much about this particular painting?
Maybe there's some kinship of country involved there.' This is all
in a matter of seconds. ... I called back the agent and said I'd go
in,'' MacNicol said.
   Pesci, tired of scripts that were blatant imitations of Joey
LaMotta (the boxer Jake's brother) in ``Raging Bull,'' took a liking
to Getz and agreed to talk to producers Richard Donner and Joel
Silver. Getz, in protective custody, is an accountant who has
laundered nearly half a billion dollars in drug money from the
organization that Gibson and Glover are trying to crack.
   ``I explained that I saw him very frantic and a big pest and a
whiner, wanting to be a cop and a hero himself, knowing all about
police procedures. I acted out a couple of bits for the character
and they both started laughing. They said, `What are we wasting time
for? Let's get him in wardrobe, it's funny, let him do it.'''
   Receiving the part was the first step for Pesci. He still wasn't
sure if he would hurt or help the team of Gibson and Glover.
   ``I knew when I met Mel and Danny and hung with them a little bit
if I could pull this off,'' Pesci said. ``Mel and Danny had their
own way of working; it's hard to break into something like that.
   ``They don't know where you're coming from. They're afraid to
just say, `Go ahead and ruin our movie, c'mon in and ruin it.' They
were going to be nice and also a little cautious. That was opening
day, but it worked out well.''
   Like Murray and Aykroyd, MacNicol had an extensive background in
improvisational theater. The Dallas native added his own touches to
his screen character, speaking broken English in a thick Eastern
European accent.
   ``When I did read for the part, I said, `Anything goes?' Because
I had seen the guys out in the waiting room, they were young John
Carradine types _ tall, quiet and menacing. This thing, this
character, came full blown like Athena out of my skull. Judging from
the looks in their eyes, they were thinking, `We can use this guy _
we got to use this guy.'''
   Pesci also took liberties, drawing on an unusual source for
Getz's flustered way of expressing himself.
   ``If you go to Disneyland in California, all the employees are
Mormons from Utah, nice kids, great smiles,'' Pesci explained.
``They handle people all day long. They never get angry.
   ``You walk up to one and say, `Excuse me, we're looking all over
the place and can't find Fantasyland. They start saying, `OK, OK,
Fantasyland. OK, OK. You're here, OK, OK.' I just added to it.''
   MacNicol and Pesci each play characters far different from
themselves. They wanted it that way.
   ``That's the fun for me,'' MacNicol explained. ``It's like a
hunt, looking for all the characteristics, making up this mosiac. I
think I'm one of the youngest character actors.''
   ``Yeah, that's the best,'' Pesci said. ``I've heard a million
actors say it. It's such a great thing to get out of yourself,
somewhere else.
   ``We all have a little bit of Leo Getz or Joey LaMotta. We all
have these kinds of people in us, that's where an actor gets it
from. What you do is bring that part of you out more. As if you were
that type of a person.''
   But the actors took differing views of a supporting player's
responsibilities.
   ``They don't have to do any of the awful chores,'' MacNicol said.
``They don't have to heave that story along. They get to have the
most fun.''
   ``It is fun, but it's still a job,'' Pesci cautioned. ``The other
way to look at it is if the character fails, if the movie fails, I
could have gotten the heat for it. `Well, they brought this other
character in there and he was jerking around trying to be funny and
he wasn't funny.'''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It may not be as well known as the SAT, but the
Gesell test taken by kindergartners in nearly one-fifth the nation's
school districts can be just as important to a child's future.
Backers argue it can spare the immature a lot of grief in early
schooling. But the Gesell Institute which publishes the test is in
deep financial trouble as a growing chorus of critics say it can
wrongly, and indelibly, brand the very young as ``slow.''

   Diane Jackson calls it ``the gift of
time.'' For Beth Bradley, it was ``the theft of a year.''
   Jackson's daughter, Jennifer, and Bradley's son, Shane, are among
thousands of 2{- to 6-year-olds each year who take the Gesell
``school readiness'' test designed to assess physical, social and
emotional maturity.
   The Gesell is, in effect, a kiddie board _ as crucial to school
success as the college board exams taken years later.
   The outcome can determine whether a child attends regular
kindergarten or first grade, or is consigned to an extra year in
slower-paced ``transitional'' or ``developmental'' kindergartens for
the less mature.
   The Gesell Institute, located here in two tudor mansions next
door to Yale University's divinity school, estimates its test is
used in 18 percent of U.S. school districts. But educators and
psychologists have lately criticized it as biased, scientifically
baseless and prone to abuse.
   ``A loose cannon,'' says education professor Samuel Meisels of
the University of Michigan, speaking of the test. ``It's being used
to hurt kids, in the name of beneficence.''
   Such criticisms have taken a heavy financial toll on the
78-year-old institute, acting director Laura Freebain-Smith told a
reporter. Earlier this month, following a second consecutive year of
deficits, the institute decided to put its New Haven properties up
for sale and reduce its teacher training staff from 10 to 2.
   Gesell leaders, meanwhile, acknowledge the abuses and say the
test is being updated.
   Nonetheless, they stand by its basic soundness and point to
legions of teachers and principals who praise it as a valuable tool
to help them assign children to appropriate classes.
   ``Fads come and go, but the Gesell work is correct,'' said
Freebairn-Smith.
   Jennifer and Shane got the same verdict from Gesell: they tested
immature, and school authorities advised an extra year.
   Jennifer's mother now says the extra year worked miracles. She
just finished first-grade with a B-average at Golfield Elementary
School in Rockledge, Fla.
   But Shane's mother says the test made her son a wreck. He was so
unhappy in what he called the ``dummy class'' in Denver City, Texas,
that she took him out two weeks early last spring.
   The Gesell test is not new. Its author, Dr. Arnold Gesell, a
pediatrician and school psychologist, first published it in 1925,
mainly as a tool for doctors rather than educators.
   Now school districts across the country use it. It's especially
popular in Florida, Connecticut, North Carolina, New Hampshire,
Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and California, according to
Susan L. Sweitzer, who runs the workshops where teachers train to
administer the test.
   But never have it's merits been so hotly challenged by educators,
psychologists and parents.
   ``I think every test maker bears the burden of proof that their
test does what they say it will do. They have not demonstrated that.
They resort to faith,'' said Meisels.
   ``There's a lot of truth in the criticisms,'' said
Freebairn-Smith. ``It's forced us to take a look at how our test is
used.''
   The Gesell is unlike the usual standardized pencil-and-paper test.
   For about 20 minutes, a teacher or counselor has a youngster
build with blocks, name animals, answer questions such as ``what did
you get for your last birthday?'' and fill in a drawing of an
``incomplete man'' missing limbs and facial features.
   To the trained eye, the answers are supposed to reveal maturity.
   For example, a 5- or 6-year old might write a beautifully formed
letter ``O.'' But if a child starts the letter at the bottom of the
circle, that's taken as a sign of immaturity.
   Likewise, children who draw belly buttons on the ``incomplete
man'' _ who wears an incomplete bow tie _ are often judged less
mature.
   A review of the test in the ``Mental Measurements Yearbook,'' an
annual guide to standardized tests, says Gesell has offered ``no
evidence of internal consistency, reliability, stability over time,
or empirical validity.''
   Critics also charge the questions are outdated and biased against
minorities and poor children. The test's norms, or averages, were
last updated in 1979, and they were based on 640 New England
children, only 7 percent of whom were minorities.
   The test asks, for example, ``What does your daddy do?'' The
question might baffle the many children nowadays who lack live-in
daddies.
   Gesell's critics, who include several early childhood education
associations, recently called for an end to mass standardized
testing of young children.
   Some of Gesell's woes reflect recent criticisms aimed at
standardized tests generally. The Scholastic Aptitude Test, taken by
college-bound high school students, has been similarly accused of
bias, unfairness and misuse.
   The Gesell debate is also related to a larger dispute among
educators: Are many schoolchildren too old for their grade, or too
young?
   Louise Bates Ames, at 80 a best-selling author of child-rearing
guides and the institute's guiding spirit since Dr. Gesell's death
in 1961, contends that as many as half of U.S. schoolchildren are
``overplaced,'' or too young for their grade. Many eventually get
labeled slow, or learning disabled.
   Such problems might never occur, said Ames, if children were
promoted on the basis of ``developmental age,'' not chronological
age. If educators and parents would only heed the test's results,
fewer children would drop out or be held back later, she said.
   ``What we're looking at is the whole spectrum of 12 to 13 years
of schooling. It's not so much a fear that a kid won't make it in
kindergarten. It's hard for parents to see that,'' said Jane Keirns,
a member of Gesell's national lecture staff.
   Test critics take the opposite view. They see little virtue in a
test that helps schools justify keeping youngsters from progressing
with their peers. And they oppose segregating children who test
``young'' on the Gesell into ``developmental kindergartens'' or
``transitional classes.''
   ``There's little that supports what goes on in developmental K.
If a kid is at least one year too old by ninth grade, the
probability of dropping out is 50 percent greater,'' said Meisels.
``At least 20 percent of kids in kindergarten are too old for their
grade. It may be substantially greater than that.''
   The test's validity is hard to evaluate. There are no objectively
right or wrong answers.

<HEAD>Mazda RX-7 Still One of The Best</HEAD>

<HEAD>Eds: GTUs throughout is CORRECT. For newspapers with the capability,

   Like any car that has been around for a decade, the Mazda RX-7
has changed. The car is wider and more expensive. The outside
styling is more rounded, and the RX-7 has been transformed from a
spirited scooter to a more substantial sports car.
   But thankfully, some of the best features remain: the durable,
smooth rotary engine, the sporty handling and nimble responsiveness,
and the rear-drive design.
   The performance of the Mazda RX-7 GTUs test car clearly showed
that many of the selective changes over the years have helped keep
the RX-7 a viable competitor in the sports car field.
   The engine in the test car, teamed with five-speed manual
transmission, started easily and worked smoothly in both city and
highway driving. The GTUs is not the fastest sports car around, with
a rating of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph, but it had plenty of
good, steady zip. And there's a higher-priced, turbocharged RX-7
model that offers even quicker acceleration.
   I also appreciated the fact that the rear-drive design meant
there was no torque steer under hard acceleration as there is in so
many front-drive sporty cars. Though I noticed that the test car
gulped down the fuel, I was impressed by the high-revving rotary
engine, especially knowing it has earned a reputation for
reliability.
   A Mazda spokesman noted that RX-7s ``have done extraordinarily
well in endurance-related racing.'' Consumer Reports also ranks
highly the RX-7s of the 1982-87 model years. They consistently
earned a much better than average label in the magazine's survey of
car owners.
   The Mazda spokesman mentioned the loyalty among many RX-7 owners.
With about 41,000 members, the RX-7 clubs around the country are
rank as one of the largest collection of clubs honoring a single car
marque.
   Fit and finish on the test car was superb. The ventilation system
was powerful, and the seats _ redesigned for 1989 with more lateral
support _ were firm and sturdy, which I appreciated as I got
accustomed to the car's hard, sporty ride.
   There was only room for two in the GTUs test car, though Mazda
offers a two-plus-two GXL model.
   Behind the two front seats in the test car were two deeply
recessed storage boxes with locks followed by a flat hatchback area
with luggage straps to keep items from sliding around. The hatchback
lid popped all the way up with a touch of a lever that was to the
lower left of the driver seat.
   However, I found it a bit awkward to bend over the back of the
car body and reach way inside the hatchback area. Yet because of the
hatchback's sloping lid, the taller items I carried always had to be
placed up front, behind the seats, which also was the hardest spot
to get at.
   The RX-7 GTUs comes with automatic shoulder belts that were the
most sensitive _ and comforting _ I've seen. If I suddenly tried to
reach for the glove box, or even move forward to look to the right,
that driver belt would hold me in.
   The dashboard layout was clear, easy to read, with no digital
gadgets. The blinker was a little lever on the dashboard, like that
in the Ford Probe, and the lights that warn that the brake is on,
the hatch is open or that something is wrong under the hood were
uniquely grouped next to the clock in the middle of the dash.
   The RX-7, at $6,995 for its April 1978 debut in the United
States, was a mid-priced sports car in its early days and still
holds that position, though its price range today is from $17,300 to
$25,600.
   A Mazda spokesman said competitors include Toyota MR2, which
starts around $14,000, and the Chevrolet Corvette, which starts
around $31,000.
   Partly because of the higher prices for sports cars, partly
because of increased competition from sporty coupes that offer
seating for more than two passengers, and partly because of rising
insurance costs, sales of the RX-7 have been declining. They hit
56,205 in 1986, then fell to 38,345 in 1987 and 27,814 in 1988,
Mazda said. Sales of about 20,000 are expected this year.
   Because of the increase in insurance costs, some buyers are being
quoted prices for insurance on their sports cars that are higher
than their monthly car payments, a Mazda spokesman said.
   A typical RX-7 buyer has median age of 36, according to Rod
Bymaster, product manager of sports and sporty cars for Mazda Motor
of America. Sixty-five percent of RX-7 buyers are male, and half are
married, he said. Sixty-seven percent have a college degree or more,
and the median household income is between $55,000 and $60,000.
   Though Mazda now is promoting its newest two-seat car _ the
Miata, which starts at $13,800 _ the company said the RX-7 will
remain. The Miata is coming into the lower end of the sports car
market because the RX-7 has moved upscale, a spokesman explained.

   The Sandinista National Liberation Front won a
bitter civil war in Nicaragua 10 years ago that ended the
42-year-old Somoza dynasty, but the promise of the revolution is yet
to be realized. Here is a report.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade has passed since July 19,
1979, when exuberant Sandinista leaders rode into the city behind
young guerrillas in makeshift uniforms who had driven out the
entrenched Somoza dictatorship.
   How does Nicaragua fare after a decade of revolution?
   The Sandinistas remain firmly in power despite determined U.S.
opposition, but the people do not have a better life, the economy is
destitute, some colleagues have joined the opposition and the Soviet
Union has become less generous with aid.
   ``There is Sandinismo here for another 50 years,'' an experienced
South American diplomat said, but a recent report said last year's
per capita gross national product was $300.
   That would make Nicaragua the Western Hemisphere's poorest
country, a distinction long held by Haiti, and puts it in the same
economic category as Somalia, Sudan and other poor African nations.
   With general elections only seven months away, the organizational
skills and popularity of the Sandinista National Liberation Front
face a tough test.
   Sandinismo has preserved its populist essence and the grass-roots
organization of a group that knows how angry citizens who feel they
have nothing to lose can overthrow a government. It is getting a
negative message from some of those citizens.
   ``I don't need to know about numbers,'' said a Managua woman who
works as a domestic. ``All I know is that every month things are
getting worse. We've been like this for 10 years. These people don't
know what they're doing. It's time we had a change.''
   The gross national product figure was in a study, commissioned by
the Sandinistas and underwritten by Sweden, that also said
consumption had fallen by more than 70 percent since 1979 and the
buying power of workers was down by more than 92 percent.
   Part of the study was presented in May to a conference of 16
potential aid donors in Stockholm. President Daniel Ortega said
Nicaragua needed $250 million in aid for 1989 alone, but left
Stockholm with only $50 million.
   Ortega denied Nicaragua was among the world's poorest nations. He
said studies by a U.S. economist his government hired found ``all of
Latin America is undergoing a serious economic recession in which
the standard of living has dropped to levels of 11 years ago.''
   The study sponsored by Sweden recommends that some Sandinista
policies be reversed by halting land redistribution, emphasizing
private production and slashing the military, education and health
budgets.
   ``There will be no reversal,'' Ortega said. ``The revolutionary
project continues.''
   He has traveled the country issuing land titles to tenant
farmers. His government confiscated the plantations of three growers
who opposed the Sandinistas and threatened to seize the land of
other ``economic saboteurs.''
   Lately, pro-government news media have been recalling the civil
war that brought victory in July 1979.
   One photograph shows Ortega and other guerrilla commanders, guns
slung on their shoulders, riding into Managua in a crowded jeep 48
hours after President Anastasio Somoza had fled the country.
   Some guerrilla leaders and anti-Somoza politicians who celebrated
on that day later left to fight again, against the Sandinistas.
   Among them was Eden Pastora, the fabled Commander Zero who became
the deputy defense minister but defected in 1981 to the
U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas.
   Alfredo Cesar, president of the central bank, left Nicaragua on
his honeymoon in 1982 and joined the directorate of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the umbrella for anti-Sandinista organizations in exile.
Cesar returned a month ago as a member of the political opposition.
   The most striking loss was of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, widow
of murdered publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who had been a foe of
Somoza. Chamorro's assassination caused a groundswell of support for
the Sandinistas.
   Mrs. Chamorro's family owns the newspaper La Prensa, now in
opposition to the Sandinistas. She became a member of the first
junta, but resigned in April 1980, declaring the Sandinista goals to
be incompatible with her hopes for a democratic Nicaragua.
   Current Sandinista thinking seems to be that only a continuation
of their populist policies will win the election, yet some of those
policies are alienating the private sector and pushing the economy
deeper into crisis.
   In past years, Sandinista leaders have said the very survival of
their revolution was its greatest triumph.
   A U.S.-supported guerrilla war began two years after the
revolution. The Sandinistas have survived the cutoff of
international credits, instigated by Washington, and the destruction
wrought last October by Hurricane Joan, which they estimated at $800
million.
   They have done so thanks in large part to aid from the Soviet
bloc and friends in northern Europe, notably Sweden, but that aid
has diminished.
   With declining aid and election impending, the Sandinistas have
fallen back on one of their strengths: organizing from the bottom up.
   Neighborhood groups known as Sandinista Defense Committees had
vanished because of resistance by the population but are being
revived. Organizations of women, youth and peasants are being
strengthened.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, just before noon on a blistering-hot Thursday, the
first jubilant, ragtag column of Sandinistas entered Managua,
following their only tank down a side street to the bunker of ousted
dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Without firing a shot, the guerrillas burst through the gate of
the deserted military headquarters and swarmed into the bunker and
supply sheds, ending a bitter, bloody revolution that brought the
biggest change in Central America since independence from Spain.
   Somoza had fled to Miami two days earlier, leaving the country
his family had ruled for 42 years in the hands of a caretaker
president who also fled after only a few hours in office.
   Managua looked nearly empty the morning of July 19, 1979, a day
Nicaraguans call simply ``the victory.'' Somoza's soldiers, aware
that the Sandinistas were only hours away, had been deserting their
positions all night, abandoning weapons and vehicles, donning
civilian clothes, blending into the population.
   After dawn, church bells on the outskirts began to ring. The
bells had signaled rebel victories in other towns and cities.
   A group of government soldiers slipped into the lobby of the
Intercontinental Hotel, next to the military headquarters, and
peeled off the uniforms they wore over civilian clothes. They left
the uniforms, weapons and other gear on the lobby floor.
   Most people stayed in their homes as that first column of about
700 Sandinista fighters from the northern city of Leon walked by.
Later in the day, thousands more from rebel-held southern cities
poured into the capital in commandeered government trucks.
   Inside Somoza's compound, guerrillas threw down their old
weapons, shed tattered uniforms and outfitted themselves with new
clothing.
   A Sandinista couple posed for pictures in Somoza's bed, with a
red-and-black rebel flag draped over the headboard. Somoza had lived
in the bunker for several weeks.
   A tired guerrilla with holes in his boots found several cases of
U.S.-made C-rations and retired to Somoza's office, put his feet on
the desk under a portrait of the departed enemy and enjoyed a can of
peaches. He said it was his first food in two days.
   Managua became a madhouse that day. The victors fired thousands
of newly captured bullets into the air, commandeered cars and
painted them with Sandinista slogans. They freed hundreds of
political and ordinary prisoners from jails in Managua and nearby
Tipitapa.
   Wild shooting continued for two hours, but miraculously no one
was hit. Then a tropical downpour drenched and calmed the city.
   Daniel Ortega, the member of the five-member Sandinista junta who
would become president, arrived from Costa Rica at about 5:30 p.m.
   On Friday, July 20, when all had reached Managua, the junta
members were given a tumultuous welcome in the main plaza by about
500,000 people. A Sandinista flag dangled from a statue atop the
wrecked shell of Managua's cathedral.
   The civil war was over. One Nicaraguan in five was homeless and,
by Red Cross estimates, about 45,000 people had been killed.
   Reporters who entered Somoza's bunker before the guerrillas
arrived found unfinished cups of coffee beside maps in the war room.
The general's hat worn by Somoza, a West Point graduate, was on its
accustomed hook.
   Two partially packed suitcases had been left behind, their
contents half-scattered in the room.
   Somoza's departure by private jet had long been a question of
when, not if.
   The United States, his main military supplier, had stopped
shipments and pressured others to do so. By some accounts, Somoza
could have defended his position for only about three weeks and
lacked the arms to recapture any of the more than 25 cities held by
the Sandinistas.
   With army casualties mounting and guerrilla forces growing, he
faced a manpower problem.
   Toward the end, barefoot young men from the Atlantic jungle
region were being trucked into government training camps and sent
out less than a week later to face seasoned, disciplined guerrilla
fighters in an uneven battle.
   U.S. Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo had been meeting almost daily
with Somoza, arguing the hopelessness of the dictator's situation.
   Somoza rarely left his bunker. Reporters kept an eye on it during
the day, but were prevented from doing so at night by a 7 p.m.
shoot-to-kill curfew.
   On Monday, July 16, Somoza's prized parrots were brought in their
cages to the bunker. That night, he met secretly with his National
Assembly and resigned.
   An aide confirmed that Somoza left for Miami, where he had an
estate, at 4 a.m. on Tuesday, July 17. The aide fled a day later.
   Pezzullo moved to Panama on Wednesday with other key members of
the U.S. Embassy staff.
   Now it was Thursday morning, July 19, and the church bells rang
in the distance. Managua was without police or a government.
Thousands of citizens were armed with rifles dropped by Somoza's
soldiers. No one was in charge.
   Many people who had not fired a shot in the war suddenly became
Sandinistas, setting up free-lance roadblocks and checkpoints, armed
with found weapons.
   Within a few years, three of the five original junta members, two
Nicaraguan ambassadors to Washington and a top Sandinista field
commander had abandoned the new government. Some had joined the
armed opposition.
   The United States was financing and training the growing Contra
rebel movement and Nicaragua was at war with itself again.

   The exchange's board of directors on Tuesday ordered all traders
holding commitments to buy or sell more than 3 million bushels of
soybeans for delivery this month to reduce those positions by at
least 20 percent each trading day through July 20, when the July
contract expires.
   Analysts said the order would likely result in a sharp drop in

   Anglo-French takeover strategist Sir James
Goldsmith is being characteristically flamboyant with his joint $21
billion offer for BAT Industries PLC.
   The hostile offer for the diversified British conglomerate _
which may be best known in the United States by its Kool and Benson
and Hedges cigarettes and Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's
department stores _ is only the latest bold move by Goldsmith, a
jet-setter who already has established a reputation as an
international takeover strategist.
   The 56-year-old Goldsmith was joined in the BAT Industries bid by
British investor Jacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry
Packer.
   Earlier this year, Goldsmith formed a takeover vehicle called
Anglo Group PLC, which he said would be an ``industrial improvement
organization.'' Its bids for undervalued firms, he said, could well
be ``thoroughly hostile.''
   So far, the investment group has bought a 29.9 percent stake in
the British food company Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC.
   But long before Anglo Group, Goldsmith had created a reputation
as a takeover strategist both in Europe and in the United States,
where his conquests included Crown Zellerbach Corp., Diamond
International and Continental Group. Goldsmith reaped profits by
breaking up and cutting costs at acquired businesses.
   Goldsmith also became embroiled in a lengthy, bitter takeover
battle for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in 1986 that ended after the
company undertook a major restructuring, selling off most of its
non-tire businesses, and agreed to buy Goldsmith's Goodyear stock,
which he sold at an estimated $87 million profit.
   Goldsmith was born in 1933 to a father who was a British member
of Parliament, had taken a French wife and became a hotelier in
France.
   The young Goldsmith went to Eton, the exclusive British boys
boarding school. He left in his mid-teens, already having
established a reputation for being an audacious gambler, and later
held jobs as a waiter and cook.
   At the age of 20, he eloped with Bolivian tin heiress Isabel
Patino. Pursued by the world's press and her enraged family, they
married in Scotland. She died in childbirth several months later.
   Goldsmith is married to his third wife, Lady Annabel Birley. He
has seven children.
   Tall, mostly bald and blue-eyed, Goldsmith has British and French
passports. He owns homes in London, Paris and New York, and an
estate in Mexico.
   Descriptions of him have included such terms as charming,
petulant and meticulous.
   Although is descended from a German banking family, he is a
self-made man who started out with little money of his own.
   He had a variety of early business ventures, selling diet aids,
starting shops catering to pregnant women with clothing and other
products such as strollers, and ultimately merging various food
companies into one British group, Cavenham Ltd.
   In France, he headed the General Occidentale SA conglomerate,
which has interests in oil, publishing and retailing, including the
Grand Union supermarket chain in the United States. He sold most of
his General Occidentale holdings for an estimated $243 million about
three months before world financial markets crashed in October 1987.
   The Times of London ranks Goldsmith as Britain's 10th richest
person, with a fortune estimated at $1.2 billion.
   Goldsmith received his knighthood in 1976 from then-British prime
minister Harold Wilson and has been awarded France's Legion
d'Honneur.

   Profits of the 500 largest industrial companies
outside the United States soared nearly 50 percent in 1988 from the
year before while employment at the companies jumped, according to a
survey by Fortune Magazine.
   Total profits of the Fortune International 500 rose to $116.5
billion last year from $78.1 billion in 1987, the business magazine
said Tuesday. Together, the companies added 300,000 new jobs.
   Japan had the largest number, 159, of companies in the group of
500, two more than in the previous survey. Britain came next with 74
companies, followed by West Germany (53), France (39), Canada (28),
Sweden (20), Australia and Switzerland (13 each) and Finland and
South Korea (11 each).
   Royal Dutch@Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch oil giant, retained its
No. 1 spot on the list for the twelfth straight year. Japanese
automaker Toyota jumped into the No. 2 spot for the first time,
while British Petroleum dropped to No. 3 after 11 straight years as
No. 2.
   Fortune attributed the changes to Toyota's relentless annual
sales growth, which has averaged 22 percent for the past five years,
and to the slump in the oil industry affecting British Petroleum.
   The other top ten foreign companies were:
   _4. IRI, Italy, metals.
   _5. Daimler-Benz, West Germany, automobiles, electronics.
   _6. Hitachi, Japan, electronics.
   _7. Siemens, West Germany, electronics.
   _8. Fiat, Italy, automobiles.
   _9. Matsushita Electric Industrial, Japan, electronics.
   _10. Volkswagen, West Germany, automobiles.

<HEAD>BAT's Diversification Strategy Made It A Takeover Target, Analysts
Say</HEAD>

   BAT Industries PLC's strategy of diversifying away
from its core tobacco business principally into financial services
made it a tempting takeover and breakup target for a group led by
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, analysts said.
   The group launched a $21 billion, all-securities offer on Tuesday
for BAT, the world's biggest tobacco company. The conglomerate
quickly rejected the offer, which is second in size only to this
year's $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. of the United States
by the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   London-based BAT, once known as British-American Tobacco, has
been the target of takeover speculation, partly because analysts
consider the company's businesses worth more if sold off separately.
   Analysts estimate BAT's pieces could easily fetch more than $25
billion, compared with its stock market valuation of about $22
billion, based on its closing stock price Tuesday.
   ``It always has been a lowly rated stock because of its tobacco
business and despite the recent sucessful Farmers Insurance
purchase,'' said Charles Pick, an analyst with Nomura Research
Institute.
   Pick also said the financial community's lower rating of BAT's
tobacco business has been applied even to the company's other
businesses, which include retailing and paper manufacture.
   Earnings also have been variable in recent years because of
exchange rate fluctuations, Pick said.
   Bruce Davidson, an analyst with Smith New Court PLC, said some of
BAT's acquisitions have performed better than others, but overall
its diversification has been ``largely beneficial.''
   Nevertheless, Goldsmith told a news conference Tuesday that BAT's
``strategic error'' had been using the cash flow of its core tobacco
business to buy businesses that are entirely unrelated.
   The financial consequences of the diversification have been
``pedestrian earnings,'' Goldsmith said. He and his partners now see
restructuring as ``the only logical course to follow.''
   Goldsmith said that by selling BAT's non-tobacco businesses he
intended to unlock ``shareholder value.''
   BAT operates in about 90 countries and employs 310,000 people.
   BAT chairman Patrick Sheehy spent more than $8 billion in the
past five years buying financial services companies, including
general insurer Eagle Star; Hambro Life, renamed Allied Dunbar; and
Canada Trustco, Canada's seventh largest financial institution.
   In its most recent acquisition, BAT took over Los Angeles-based
Farmers Insurance Group Inc. for $5.2 billion cash last year after a
protracted takeover battle.
   Last year, tobacco contributed less than 50 percent of BAT's
profits for the first time.
   Sales of the tobacco busineses were flat at the equivalent of $11
billion, with operating profit of $1.2 billion, also little changed.
   BAT's cigarette brands include Benson and Hedges, Kool, Kent,
John Player Special, Lucky Strike and Viceroy.
   Its brand names in paper products are Wiggins Teape in Europe and
Appleton in the United States.
   BAT also operates the Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's and
Argos stores.
   BAT's after-tax earnings rose 21 percent to $1.55 billion in
1988, while revenue rose 3 percent to $28.9 billion.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced that the headquarters
of its international tobacco division will be moved to
Winston-Salem, N.C., from London.
   The relocation is part of a reorganization of RJR Nabisco's
worldwide tobacco operations, the company said Tuesday. RJR Nabisco
has been reorganizing since it was taken over in a $25 billion
buyout by the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
earlier this year.
   ``R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International is one of the fastest
growing parts of our company, and it plays an important role in the
strategic plans for the future of RJR Nabisco,'' said Louis V.
Gerstner, RJR Nabisco's chairman and chief executive officer.
   He said the move will unite the management of the company's
tobacco businesses in a single place while bringing the
international team closer both to the New York headquarters of the
corporate parent and to the main office of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., the U.S. tobacco business, which also is located in
Winston-Salem.
   RJR Nabisco recently moved its corporate headquarters from
Atlanta to New York.

   Flight attendants at United Airlines have
overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, the Association of
Flight Attendants said.
   However, the negotiations between the union and United are under
the supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare an
impasse and call for a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike
could be called.
   The negotiations, which fall under the jurisdiction of the
Railway Labor Act, are in recess, the union said Tuesday.
   The union represents about 13,500 United attendants and has been
negotiating with the carrier for nearly two years.
   One tentative agreement that included major concessions, reached
in November 1987, was rejected by the rank and file.
   The Association of Flight Attendants said 95 percent of the 9,980
ballots favored giving union leaders the authority to call a strike.
   United also is involved in negotiations with its pilots and later
this year is scheduled to open talks with the Machinists union,
which represents mechanics and ground personnel.

   They've seen their share of court battles
over multibillion-dollar takeovers before, but the bailiffs at the
Public Building had never seen a crowd as big as the one in town for
a Time Inc. hearing.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' one guard said, surveying the benches and
aisles brimming with with reporters and stock arbitragers waiting
for Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen to begin a hearing Tuesday
over pivotal arguments in the three-way takeover battle over Time.
   The event showed signs of becoming the latest historic proceeding
at the Chancery Court, which dates back to colonial days and also is
the court that hears cases involving guardianship of children, the
elderly and mentally incompetent.
   A suits-and-suspenders crowd of about 120 people jammed benches
and chairs in a Superior Court room _ the building's biggest _
borrowed to handle the mob, with another 75 lining the walls or
sitting in the aisles.
   The crowd was so big that that 35 people were shut out and
stranded in the hallway. Those inside were warned they would lose
their places to the outsiders if they left the courtroom.
   That posed further complications for the arbitragers, who are
stock speculators betting on the outcome of the takeover fight
involving Time, which wants to acquire Warner Communications Inc.
and is trying to fend off hostile bidder Paramount Communications
Inc.
   Allen wouldn't allow the arbs, who are accustomed to calling
their offices via their cellular phones while following court
hearings, to bring the phones into the courtroom. Many of the
speculators were afraid to leave the room for fear of losing their
place to someone from the hallway.
   The crush also was evident at Wilmington hotels. The night before
the hearing, a room service waitress at the Radisson Hotel said at
11 p.m. that there had been 169 orders, an unusually busy night.
   ``And they're still checking in,'' she said.
   But the Time hearing wasn't the only activity keeping the Public
Building busy Tuesday.
   ``Be advised, there's a sheriff's sale on the first floor,'' said
a voice crackling over a bailiff's walkie-talkie.

<HEAD>Company Claims to Have Technology To Make High-Definition TV Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Seattle-based partnership says it has developed
a way to send both high-definition television and standard broadcast
signals on the bandwidths currently used to transmit conventional TV
signals.
   The development, which would be a breakthrough in television
technology, could speed the arrival of the vastly improved pictures
and sound available with HDTV. But some industry analysts were
skeptical of the claims.
   Officials of Northwest StarScan say their product will be
marketed first to private companies that can't afford space on a
satellite. The first customers are expected to be signed in December.
   ``We are not doing high-definition (television) because there is
no reason to now,'' said StarScan general partner A. Frederick
Greenberg, citing the virtual lack of television sets on the market
capable of receiving high-definition signals.
   However, StarScan spokesman Wiley Brooks said the company will be
``a major participant'' in HDTV when it is commercially viable.
   StarScan officials say they can compress a standard television
broadcast signal to fit in a bandwidth one-tenth the size it now
requires on a satellite.
   This enables the company to transmit at least 10 times as many
pictures over a satellite channel without disrupting the TV signals.
The cost of using satellites could be reduced to one-tenth, they
said.
   ``We do the compression in a way that does not reduce the power
of the signal. There is no degradation of the signal,'' said Brooks.
   Currently, HDTV signals cannot fit on a standard bandwidth
because they require much more information than a regular television
signal.
   Stephen Roberts, the company's chief financial officer, said
StarScan's technology compresses multiple broadcast signals into one
signal that can be separated at the receiving end with ``almost nil
degradation.''
   Other companies developing compression technology, such as Zenith
Electronics Corp., are compressing a single broadcast signal, he
said.
   Bruce Franca, deputy chief of the Federal Communications
Commission's engineering and technology office, said compressing
individual signals to factors of 4-to-1 on satellite and 2-to-1 on
cable can be done fairly regularly.
   At first the company plans to go into point-of-purchase
advertising, in which televisions could be set up in department
stores to advertise to consumers while they are in the store, Brooks
said. Commercials could be broadcast tailor-made for each
department, he said.
   Satellites and underground cables would not require modification
to receive the compressed signal, he said. A compressed signal and a
standard signal could be transmitted side by side in the same
bandwidth, he added.
   The FCC's said the company does not require the agency's approval
for closed-circuit broadcasts.
   The technology is a proprietary secret that has not been
patented, Brooks said. He said the patent had not yet been applied
for ``so as not to give people a road map on how to do it.''
   Other companies have developed compression technology but only
with a reduction in picture quality.
   The company's claims, if proven true, could have a tremendous
impact in the telecommunications field, analysts said. But several
were skeptical about StarScan's claims.
   ``If you could carry a lot more information on the same spectrum,
and with the push today for HDTV, it would be very beneficial. The
big question is, can they do it?'' said William Hassinger, assistant
bureau chief of the FCC's mass media bureau.
   ``If they are achieving tenfold compression and they're not going
into HDTV, they would be withholding from the industry something the
industry has been on its knees begging for,'' said Dale Cripps,
publisher of ``HDTV Newsletter,'' a Portland, Ore.-based newsletter
on high-definition television.
   ``I think it's real neat stuff, but the question is is their
technology faster, better, cheaper than what's on the market?'' said
Greg Francfort, telecommunications analyst at First Boston Corp. in
New York.
   ``If it's viable, it's damn valuable,'' said Dave Willis,
director of engineering at Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc.,
the nation's largest cable television operator.
   Controlling interest in the company is held by Greenberg and his
brother Richard Greenberg. Frederick Greenberg is chairman of First
City National Bank and Trust Co. in New York.
   The technology was purchased last year from from Kent,
Wash.-based Northwest Transforms Inc., which is now controlled by
the Greenbergs, Brooks said.

<HEAD>Economists Still Expect Other Banks To Lower Their Prime Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The delay by major banks in following Chase
Manhattan Bank's cut in the prime lending rate stems from
uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's monetary strategies as well
as the summer vacation season, economists say.
   ``I guess we'll have to give it a few more days,'' Kathleen
Camilli, a money market economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said Tuesday.
   Chase stood alone among the nation's large money-center banks
Monday in trimming its prime rate a half percentage point to 10.5
percent, the second such decline in as many months and the level at
which the prime stood at the start of the year.
   Other major banks generally were expected to follow the move _
which Chase said reflected its own declining costs of borrowing _
but had not done so by late Tuesday.
   Reflecting the banks' dropping costs of funds, the average yield
on six-month certificates of deposit fell to 8.79 percent last week
from 8.84 percent the previous week. Thirty-year fixed mortgage
rates dropped to an average 10.17 percent, a 14-month low, according
to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm.
   In addition, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dipped to
7.97 percent at one point Tuesday _ the lowest level since April 8,
1987, according to Camilli _ before closing up at 8.03 percent.
   The prime, a laggard among other interest rates, is a benchmark
banks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and business
credit, including home-equity lines of credit. It also determines
the rate for many credit cards.
   Economists said Tuesday that other banks undoubtedly have seen
reductions in their cost of funds in recent weeks but that they
probably want to wait until the Federal Reserve further eases its
credit policies before they cut their prime rates.
   The Fed has shown signs of loosening its grip on the nation's
money supply in reaction to a continued slowdown in economic growth
and an easing of inflation.
   The federal funds rate, which reflects the Fed's credit moves,
dipped as low as 8~ percent last week after hovering around 9{
percent. But economists said most banks probably won't cut their
prime until fed funds remains firmly at the 9 percent level. Fed
funds _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans _
closed at 9 3-16 percent late Tuesday.
   Some economists also said slow summer business may have delayed
widespread prime cuts.
   ``I think they are dragging their feet in lowering the prime
because activity has dropped off a little bit this summer, and one
way of earning profits is to keep the spread wide,'' said Ward
McCarthy, an economist and principal with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc.
   ``When rates drop banks tend to lag, whereas they're much quicker
to increase the prime when rates are rising,'' he said.
   By spread, McCarthy means the difference between the banks' cost
of borrowing and lending money.
   Some economists said prime cut delays also might be due to the
fact that a number of key decision makers at the major banks are on
vacation.
   ``I know at least one bank where that's true,'' said one source
at Chase.
   Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp., said the Fed probably will push the fed funds rate
to 9 percent once a spate of new economic data is released later
this month.
   The producer price index, industrial production, retail sales and
capacity utilization figures for June are scheduled for release
Friday, and many analysts predicted those numbers would point to a
further economic slowing.

<HEAD>Time Inc. Plans to Launch New Weekly Magazine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the same day that it fought to retain its
independence from an unwanted suitor in a Delaware courtroom, Time
Inc. announced plans to launch a new magazine, Entertainment Weekly,
in February 1990.
   Time executives insisted that is was coincidence that the
magazine announcement came on the same day as Tuesday's
widely-anticipated Chancery Court hearing on Paramount
Communications Inc.'s request for an order blocking Time's proposed
acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.
   Paramount is making its own bid for Time.
   Nonetheless, the launch of Entertainment Weekly would be Time's
first new weekly since the costly failure of its cable TV guide six
years ago.
   The new magazine has been under study for nearly two years, Time
said, and will contain reviews and reporting on television, movies,
video, music and books. Time's other weeklies are Time, People and
Sports Illustrated.
   Reginald K. Brack Jr., the head of the Time Inc. Magazine Co.,
said the new magazine will capitalize on what he called an explosion
of interest in entertainment by focusing on products rather than
personalities.
   The company said the American appetite for such material is
clear: Americans watch almost seven hours a day of television and
each year rent 2 billion videocassettes, buy more than a billion
movie tickets, spend $8 billion on popular books and $43 billion on
electronic equipment and buy more than 750 million records, tapes
and compact disks.
   Time declined to disclose how much it is investing in the launch
of Entertainment Weekly, but some industry observers said they
expect it would require at least $20 million.
   Time lost about $47 million in connection with its TV-Cable Week,
which was launched in April 1983 and folded five months later.
   After that costly experience, some analysts said Time became more
conservative in approaching new magazines.
   It has invested as a partner in several magazines developed by
others, including a 50 percent stake in a joint venture that
publishes Working Woman and Working Mother magazines. It confirmed
Tuesday that it plans to sell its stake to its partner in that
project, Dale W. Lang, for a reported $25 million.
   Over the past 18 months, Time has been involved with two
launches. Its Southern Progress Inc. subsidiary started Cooking
Light magazine and Time more recently launched Sports Illustrated
for Kids, a monthly sports magazine.
   But Time has not tried a national launch of a weekly magazine
since TV-Cable Week folded. Its executives note that no one has
successfully launched a weekly in the United States since Time's
People magazine debuted in 1974.
   Brack said no comparisons should be drawn between Entertainment
Weekly and TV-Cable Week, which was a TV listings guide distributed
and marketed mainly through cable system operators.
   He said Entertainment Weekly will cover a broad range of
entertainment topics, won't carry TV listings and will be marketed
by Time itself.
   Michael Moore, worldwide media director at the advertising agency
D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, said he thinks the magazine has a
good chance for success since ``people are spending more on
experiences than they ever have.''
   Publisher Michael J. Klingensmith, who has been testing reaction
to this type of magazine through direct mailings, said Entertainment
Weekly will start with a circulation of 500,000 and expects more
than 80 percent of the magazines will be sold through subscriptions
at $1 a copy. The newstand price will be $1.95 a copy.
   Managing Editor Jeff Jarvis, who is now the TV critic for People,
said the magazine will have its own roster of critics who will
review movies, video, television, music and books. He said other
critics including professionals, readers and entertainers also will
appear, along with stories describing what goes on behind the scenes
in shows, songs and books.
   One sample cover, for instance, called attention to a story on
``How they make a James Bond action scene.''

   Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens is one of the few
Americans to have experienced firsthand one of the stranger
traditions of capitalism in Japan: the battle of sokaiya, or
professional hecklers, versus loyal company employees at annual
shareholders meetings.
   The Texas oilman is a major shareholder in a Japanese auto parts
maker called Koito Manufacturing Co., and when he came to Tokyo last
week, he experienced ``the most unusual shareholders' meeting I've
ever attended in my life.''
   Tough-looking men in flashy suits and tightly permed hair filled
the room along with mild-mannered employees in white shirts and
neckties _ and the lone Texan.
   Pickens made a pitch for increasing shareholders' rights and
improving profits.
   A number of other shareholders backed him up. But their style was
different from Pickens' courteous drawl.
   In threatening cadences reminiscent of movie yakuza, or
gangsters, the sokaiya repeated some of Pickens' points, threw in a
bunch of their own, and badgered the visibly shaken management of
Koito for an hour an a half.
   ``Hey you,'' shouted one young man at the president of the
company. ``What kind of education are you giving your employees? I
passed 10 of them on the way in this morning, and only two said good
morning. Is that any way to treat a shareholder? Huh?''
   ``Profits are down,'' said another in tones so velvety it was
almost scary. ``It really doesn't appear that you're putting out
much effort.''
   Finally, an older man who identified himself as part of the Japan
Youth Society, an ultra-right-wing group, gave a virtuoso
performance. He began in a soft, throaty voice like Marlon Brando's
in ``The Godfather'' and ended with a ringing gutter-language parody
of pundits criticizing Japan's lack of international spirit and its
recent scandals linking businessmen and politicians.
   Pickens later praised the hecklers. ``I thought they asked some
very good questions,'' he said. Still, he admitted, ``That's an
interesting way to ask for an income statement.''
   Police say the sokaiya, who use their legal rights as
shareholders to attend meetings, have ties to the underworld. If
they aren't paid off they harrass management with endless questions
and occasionally threaten violence. Employee-shareholders turn out
in force to defend management against the attack.
   The ritual battle between employees and shareholders symbolizes a
basic conflict for Japanese companies: Just who does the company
belong to?
   The traditional Japanese notion is that it belongs to the
management and employees who devote their lives to the company.
   ``Companies are very warm to their workers. Japanese capitalism
has got almost communistic elements to it, when you think about
it,'' says Masakazu Kobayashi, one of Japan's few shareholders'
rights activists.
   But by American concepts of capitalism, and, at least legally
speaking in Japan, a company belongs to its owners. In the case of a
publicly listed company, that's the shareholders.
   As Koito's largest shareholder, Pickens asked for representation
on its board of directors. Though he owns one-fifth of the company,
he was denied a seat.
   Now he's complaining to Washington that Americans don't have the
same access to investment in Japan as Japanese have in the United
States.
   Japanese businessmen admit they largely ignore individual
shareholders, domestic as well as foreign. About 90 percent of
companies hold shareholders meetings on the same day to discourage
attendance. Dividends are widely considered money down the drain and
are generally kept low.
   But many Japanese managers argue that emphasizing employees
rather than owners and reinvesting in research and better factories
rather than paying out dividends is the secret of their success.
   Pickens' arguments won support in a number of editorials in
leading newspapers. Pickens says that Japan should increase
shareholders' rights _ in effect, emphasize short-term profits and
encourage mergers and acquisitions _ because it would be good for
the economy.
   But many investors in the booming Tokyo stock market have been
making a killing in capital gains over the past few years, and don't
really care about having a voice in management or in collecting
dividends.
   Pickens argues that managers have a responsibility to
shareholders to show regular profit growth. ``When a manager starts
talking about investing in the long-term future ... I ask, when is
the payoff? When is `someday'?'' he said.
   Many Japanese managers think ignoring quarterly profits for the
long view is essential to growth, and think Pickens' kind of
impatience is what has led to an American failure to invest in the
future.
   Finally, Pickens argues that weak shareholders lead to lazy,
unaccountable management, poor corporate performance and a sluggish
economy.
   The problem is, that's a little hard to see in Japan.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Shares Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished higher today against the
Japanese yen while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged
down.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 45.25
points, or 0.13 percent, ending at 33,701.52. The index, a
70.75-point gainer Tuesday, added 66.66 points in early trading.
   The dollar ended at 140.50 yen, gaining 0.88 yen from Tuesday's
139.62-yen close. The currency opened at 140.70 yen and moved
slightly downward while ranging between 140.40 yen and 140.95 yen.
   The dollar's strength followed its uptrend in New York overnight,
but trading in Tokyo was directionless, traders said.
   Masafumi Koyama, a Bank of Tokyo trader, said the U.S. unit,
which reached the day's high at 140.95 yen during the early session,
gradually fell in the afternoon as participants sold the dollar for
technical position adjustments.
   The dollar's rise was halted by the Bank of Japan's
dollar-selling intervention, he said.
   ``Tokyo was lacking fresh market-affecting news, and investors
were unable to determine the appropriate level of their
dollar-holding positions,'' Koyama said.
   He added that Japanese investors were hardly paying attention to
the nation's trade report for June, released late in the afternoon
Wednesday.
   Japan's June trade surplus with the United States totaled $3.634
billion, up from $3.622 billion a year earlier.
   On the stock exchange, the index fell in part because of the
yen's weakness against the dollar, dealers said.
   Market players were reluctant to buy despite the downward trend
in U.S. interest rates, because of political uncertainties ahead of
a July 23 parliamentary election, said a dealer with the New Japan
Securities Co.
   It is widely expected that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
will lose badly in the upcoming upper house election. The party has
been hurt by an influence-peddling stock scandal, an unpopular 3
percent consumption tax and Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's reported
involvement with paid mistresses.
   Investors avoid buying due to fears that the ruling party's
election loss will result in a market plunge.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, up from Tuesday's 550 million. Among the winners
were steels, constructions and shipbuildings, while automobiles and
machineries fell.

   House-Senate negotiators attempting to craft a
compromise savings and loan bailout are off to a slow start, with
some House members complaining about the unwieldiness of their
94-member delegation.
   ``The point is we don't know what we're doing here,'' Rep. Stan
Parris, R-Va., complained at one moment of confusion in Tuesday's
session.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., who is leading a leaner team of five
senators, tried to persuade the House side to agree to delete 11 to
17 ``special interest'' provisions, each affecting one or a handful
of companies.
   But the House balked, even though it had already deleted the
special interest sections before passing its own bill last month.
Because of the way the House delegation is organized, it was unable
to consider the provisions as a group.
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, has divided his conferees into platoons of 20 to
30 members, with each group handling one part of the legislation.
   ``It would take the House staff at least two, three hours to
figure out the jurisdiction'' on the special interest package,
Gonzalez said.
   There was more evidence of disarray as members of one House
platoon attempted to raise issues already addressed by another
platoon. At one point, House and Senate conferees found themselves
working from different documents and unsure of what they were voting
on, prompting Parris' complaint.
   ``I have never seen anything quite like this in my 15 years in
Congress,'' said Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky. ``It's confusing to say
the least.''
   But, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said major conference
committees typically start slow and then build steam.
   Gonzalez has said he organized his delegation in order to dilute
the influence of senior members, who bucked the majority in the
House on many issues to support S&amp;L interests. He said Tuesday that
the test of his system will be whether the conferees finish the work
carved out for them each day. So far, they have.
   Among the deals struck:
   _A special Justice Department anti-fraud task force will be
established in Dallas. The House also wanted a task force in
Southern California, but compromised with the Senate, which wanted
neither.
   _Conferees adopted the House section providing the Justice
Department with $75 million a year to detect and prosecute bank and
S&amp;L fraud. The Senate had voted to spend $50 million a year.
   _The House side, on a 13-7 vote, defeated a move by Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., to delete provisions for dozens of special
studies. He complained they would be costly and most members of
Congress would be unlikely to read them.
   _Employees, including political appointees, of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, which is being broken up in a regulatory
reorganization, will have their jobs protected for a year or get
severance pay.
   _A provision to give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
under the bill guarantees bank and S&amp;L accounts up to $100,000, the
authority to second-guess the decisions of other commercial bank
regulators was scrapped.
   On the special interest provisions, House and Senate staff
members had substantially worked out which would be deleted.
   But some conferees, including Reps. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., and
Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Sens. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., argued the provisions ought to be considered
one-by-one.
   ``It may be public interest as well as special interest to
consider the problems'' of individual institutions, Cranston said.
   Riegle said he wants the conferees to finish by July 18, more
than soon enough for the full House and Senate to ratify the package
and send it to President Bush before leaving for their August
vacation.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks $3.46 Million in Business Week Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is continuing its probe into
insider trading involving a former stockbroker who allegedly traded
on hot stocks listed in Business Week before the magazine hit the
streets even after filing a $3.46 million lawsuit in the case.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a civil
complaint alleging that former Merrill Lynch broker William J.
Dillon passed on market-sensitive information from the leading
business weekly to his mother and others.
   Dillon already has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in
the case and was sentenced in April to six months in prison.
   But none of the other four people named Tuesday has been
previously charged, and the civil lawsuit includes unnamed brokers,
investors and a bank who also allegedly profited from advance
knowledge of the magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, head of securities and
commodities fraud, said a criminal investigation in the case remains
open in New York and Connecticut. But he would not disclose whether
further criminal indictments were planned.
   Prosecutors, though, last year agreed not to pursue criminal
charges against Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, who was named in
the civil action Tuesday filed in U.S. District Court in New Haven.
   The lawsuit seeks more than $865,000 in alleged illicit profits
from the defendants and up to three times that amount in penalties
for a potential total of $3.46 million.
   It charges that Dillon paid $20 or $30 a week regularly for two
years to get copies of Business Week and then tipped off friends
about hot stocks for trading.
   According to the suit, Dillon, while working as a broker at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s New London, Conn., office, illegally obtained
copies of the magazine from March 1986 to July 1988.
   The lawsuit mentions but does not name others who allegedly
traded on the information supplied by Dillon, including a Merrill
Lynch colleague, two clients, a bank and a bank executive who all
allegedly made money in the scheme.
   Three brokers at the investment firm then known as E.F. Hutton
and two unnamed Advest Inc. brokers also allegedly bought the stocks
after being tipped off by a high-school friend of Dillon's, the
lawsuit claims.
   SEC officials declined to name the other people and would not
comment on whether further action would be taken in the case.
   In addition to Dillon and his mother, also charged are Benjamin
Libera, Dillon's high-school friend; Libera's brother Todd; and
Francis R. Sablone Jr., an attorney.
   The lawsuit seeks a total of $865,213.16 in alleged illegal
profits _ more than $478,000 from the five people named in the suit
and the rest from entities tipped off by Dillon, Benjamin Libera and
Sablone.
   Dillon is alleged to have personally traded in stocks of 110
companies favorably discussed in the Business Week column, making
$141,591. He also made another $82,016 from trading in a partnership
account, according to the suit.
   The government contends that on Thursday mornings Dillon paid
either $20 for the Business Week column or $30 for the full magazine
to various employees of R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., which prints the
weekly publication at two plants in Connecticut. Several Donnelley
employees were fired in the wake of the scandal.
   Dillon, Benjamin Libera and sometimes Sablone met at a diner in
Old Saybrook, Conn., early Thursdays to discuss the column and
decide what stocks to buy and sell, according to the lawsuit.
   After telling his mother about the scheme, Baird in March 1987
opened an account with a discount brokerage and her son called her
on Thursday mornings to tell her what stocks to trade, the suit
alleges.

<HEAD>Company to Offer Stock Split</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it plans to ask
its shareholders to consider a two-for-one common stock split and to
increase quarterly dividents 13 percent to 90 cents a share.
   P&amp;G announced Tuesday that at its annual meeting on Oct. 10, its
board of directors will ask shareholders to consider increasing the
number of shares of common stock from 500 million to 1 billion and
converting shares of currently held stock from one share to two.
   The company also will ask shareholders to increase the number of
Class A preferred shares from 297.5 million to 600 million. Series A
ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock, which is held by the
company's employee profit-sharing plan, will be split automatically.
   ``It is expected that the two-for-one common stock split will
result in a market price for common stock in a range which will be
more attractive to individual investors,'' P&amp;G said in a statement.
   The changes ``will benefit both the shareholders and the company
by creating a broader market for the stock,'' the company said.
   Shareholders of record on Aug. 11 will be able to vote at the
meeting.
   The board Tuesday declared a quarterly dividend of 80 cents per
share on common stock. It will be payable Aug. 15 to shareholders of
record July 21.
   The company also announced that depending on profits, the board
plans to declare a quarterly dividend of 90 cents per share that
will be payable to shareholders of record before the Oct. 20 common
stock split. P&amp;G said this payment would equal a 12.5 percent
increase in the dividend rate.
   The Cincinnati-based consumer products company had sales of $19
billion during fiscal 1987-88. The company makes and markets laundry
and cleaning products, personal care products, food and beverage
products, and products for business and industry.

   Princeton-Newport Partners sold and then bought
back blocks of securities at the end of 1984 for the purchase price
plus a consistent 6.25-cent commission, a federal prosecutor said in
the first securities racketeering trial.
   Cross-examining former Princeton-Newport managing partner James
Sutton Regan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen sought to
demonstrate that the deals were prearranged and in violation of
federal tax and securities laws.
   Regan, one of six defendants in the case, repeatedly denied that
the partnership had contracts with investment firms to buy back
securities at prearranged prices.
   Also charged are four other Princeton-Newport officials and a
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader. The case has attracted
wide interest because the defendants were the first securities
executives charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations law.
   Hansen listed a series of late December 1984 transactions in
which Princeton-Newport sold corporate bonds to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and bought them back a few days later at the same price plus 1-16,
or 6.25 cents. The deals were arranged by Princeton-Newport partner
Paul A. Berkman.
   ``Isn't it a fact that Mr. Berkman was told up front that it was
going to be 6 cents?'' Hansen asked.
   ``I have no knowledge of that,'' Regan said.
   The government is seeking to show that such a securities
``parking'' arrangement is illegal if it involved a predetermined
buyback date and price. Hansen said the 6.25 cent increase in the
buyback price indicated a set deal.
   The indictment in the case contends Princeton-Newport's
executives engaged in a racketeering conspiracy through bogus
securities trades to generate millions of dollars in false tax
losses.
   Regan has testified the firm arranged securities transactions but
without set buyback prices to generate short-term losses for tax
purposes. He testified under questioning from his lawyer that he
believed the deals were legal.
   Also on trial are Princeton-Newport general partners Charles
Zarzecki and Jack Z. Rabinowitz; the firm's controller, Steven B.
Smotrich; and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg.
   The jury trial is being held before U.S. District Judge Robert
Carter.
   Princeton-Newport was a small securities firm with offices in
Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., that went out of
business after the indictment was brought last August.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday, as
the market continued to be supported by Tuesday's news of Britain's
largest takeover bid.
   Shares surged higher from the outset of trading on follow-through
buying from the previous session when the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index jumped nearly 60 points.
   But prices drifted back on a lack of further inspiration, dealers
said. Many traders blamed a London transport strike for containing
activity.
   Financier Sir James Goldsmith and fellow investors on Tuesday
announced a $21 billion offer for B.A.T Industries PLC, a
diversified British conglomerate.
   Selected sectors continued to find favor among investors, dealers
said, with property, foods and insurance companies notably higher.
   At about 12:15 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was 7.3 points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,258.2, just above
its midmorning minimum of 2,257.6. The morning peak of 2,272.7, a
gain of 21.8 points, came shortly after the start of official
trading.
   Volume was 539.1 million shares at midday compared with 335.7
million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   United Airlines says it will close its suburban
regional ticket reservation office when its lease expires next June
30 and will guarantee the office's 450 employees jobs elsewhere with
the airline.
   The shutdown of the facility in Rocky River reflects an airline
trend toward fewer but larger reservation offices that are more
economically efficient, Mark Liberman, United's vice president for
reservations, said Tuesday.
   Liberman said the shutdown was announced early so employees will
have enough time to plan their futures.
   Employees choosing to relocate with United will receive moving

available in all of United's eight other domestic reservations
offices.

<HEAD>WSU Researchers Eye Japanese Cattle Breed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington State University researchers
want to find out whether a Japanese breed of cattle known as Wagyu
can be raised profitably in the United States.
   A yes answer could mean high stakes to beef producers in
Washington and elsewhere, who potentially could make hefty profits
producing beef for the lucrative Japanese restaurant market.
   ``We are shipping some of our prime beef over there now,'' said
Jerry Reeves, a WSU animal scientist involved in the Wagyu project.
``We get about $4 a pound for it. Their Wagyu cattle bring in $10 to
$40 a pound.''
   The highest grade Wagyu carcasses fetch as much as $16,000 in
Japan, about twice as much as the average carcass price in the
United States, Reeves said in a news release this week.
   ``It's a niche market, but at a different level, there may be a
market for Wagyu crossbreds, which Japan cannot produce
economically,'' said Ray Wright, a WSU animal physiologist heading
the research project. ``We also might have a market for Wagyu beef
in Japanese restaurants in the United States.''
   The scientists want to find out if Wagyu beef animals can be bred
in the United States profitably to meet Japanese preference for
erxtremely tender cuts used in sukiyaki and other Japanese dishes in
which the beef is cooked in boiling water.
   U.S. beef carcasses are a poor substitute because the fat tends
to concentrate on the outside, whereas Wagyu carcasses have a high
degree of marbling in the muscle, said Wright.
   ``If you drop our select grade beef into boiling water it comes
out tough,'' Reeves added. ``The interior fat of the Wagyu beef
protects it when it hits the water and makes it tender.''
   The WSU researchers have applied for permission to import live
Wagyu cattle, embryos and semen from Japan, but Wright said he is
not optimistic about getting approval anytime soon.
   ``You have to understand that the Japanese control the market for
Wagyu right now,'' he said. ``I think they'll be reluctant to allow
export of their animals...''
   As they await a response, the scientists have been negotiating
with a Texas cattleman to buy a couple of Wagyu heifers. The owner
might be the only person to possess Wagyus outside of Japan. His
animals are descendants of four Wagyu bulls imported to the United
States in the early 1970s.
   Once the scientists acquire some cattle, they plan to breed them
by embryo transfer processes. That would be the first step in
finding out exactly what U.S. cattleman have to do to rear the
cattle profitably.
   Even if they can gain access to the Japanese market, U.S. beef
producers will have to adapt their production systems to accommodate
the Japanese cattle, the WSU researchers say.
   U.S. cattlemen feed large numbers of animals ``all they can eat
to finish them out in 120 days,'' Reeves said. Japanese cattlemen,
he said, feed no more than six Wagyu at a time and don't market them
until they are four years old.
   ``We'll probably have to feed them the same amount of time,''
Reeves said, ``but it won't be economical to massage the animals and
feed them beer as is the custom in Japan.''

<HEAD>Japan's Exports in June Up 2.7 Percent From Year Earlier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's world trade surplus narrowed 11 percent
overall in June, but continued to widen against its largest trading
partner, the United States, Finance Ministry officials reported
Wednesday.
   Japan posted an unadjusted trade surplus of $5.290 billion last
month, down from $5.950 billion a year earlier, but up from $3.760
billion in May.
   The trade surplus with the United States grew 0.3 percent to
$3.634 billion from $3.622 billion a year earlier.
   Exports to the United States grew 7.9 percent to $7.931 billion,
while imports from the United States rose 15.3 percent to $4.297
billion, the report said.
   The trade figures in June brought Japan's surplus in the first
six months of 1989 to $33.50 billion, down slightly from $33.7
billion in the same period last year.
   Ministry officials attributed the wider trade surplus from May to
June, to a 3-percent consumption tax that forced importers to buy
more before the new tax took effect April 1.
   From a year earlier, however, both exports and imports showed
moderate growth, though imports grew faster.
   Exports of products like machinery, non-ferrous metals,
television sets, video tape recorders and semiconductors were brisk,
while Japan imported more of U.S. goods such as meat, lumber and
pulp, business machines, audio equipment, semiconductors,
non-ferrous metals, cars and steel.
   Steel imports from the United States, for instance, jumped 212.4
percent from the year-earlier month to $19.768 billion.
   In June, the government report said, the yen declined against the
dollar, making the value of yen-denominated shipments smaller when
calculated in dollar terms. The dollar was valued at an average
143.06 yen in June, a slight gain from 143.06 yen a year earlier.
   Due to Japan's economic expansion that accompanied personal
consumption and corporate equipment investment, imports of
manufactured goods remained strong, accounting for 49.9 percent of
overall imports in June.
   In the first half of 1989, oil prices were generally lower,
although they began rising in May and June and pushed up overall
import figures.
   In addition to the introduction of the consumption tax, Finance
Ministry officials said, the death of Emperor Hirohito in January
and his funeral and other services in the following months dampened
business activities of many companies and hurt the country's trade.

<HEAD>SmithKline Beckman Expects Second-Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp., awaiting a vote on
a planned merger with Beecham Group PLC, announced its
second-quarter profit is expected to rise about 7 percent over the
same period last year.
   The pharmaceutical company announced Tuesday its operating income
is expected to increase by 30 percent to 35 percent, sales by about
10 perecent, and earnings per share to 92 cents to 95 cents, up from
79 cents in the second quarter of 1988.
   Net earnings are expected to increase at a lower rate than
operating income because of interest expenses, exchange losses and
other non-operating expenses, SmithKline said.
   The preliminary estimate was released before a scheduled July 26
meeting during which shareholders will vote on the proposed merger
between SmithKline and Beecham Group, forming SmithKline Beecham.
Beecham shareholders approved the merger June 20.
   Therapeutics sales are expected to increase about 10 percent in
the second quarter. Operating income for therapeutics is expected to
be up 40 percent to 45 percent, mainly because of slower growth in
operating expenses and improved sales of Tagamet and Dyazide, two of
SmithKline's most popular products.
   U.S. sales of those two drugs were weak during last year's second
quarter.
   Beckman Instruments sales are expected to be about 3 percent
higher than sales of the same quarter last year. Operating income is
expected to rise about 10 percent, while net income is expected to
drop about 6 percent.
   That decline is primarily due to interest expense related to
long-term debt incurred as part of Beckman's recapitalization in the
third quarter of 1988 and exchange losses.
   Clinical Laboratory Services sales are projected to be up about
19 percent in the quarter. Operating income is expected to rise
about 12 percent.

   The stock market pulled back a bit today, running
into some resistance after a six-session rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .19 to 2,514.42
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 366 up, 566
down and 573 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.40 million shares as of 10

   They also noted some uncertainty over whether interest rates
would keep declining in the near future as steadily as they have in
the recent past.
   A rally in bond prices bogged down Tuesday after the yield on
long-term Treasury bonds briefly dipped below 8 percent.
   In addition, brokers noted that other large money-center banks
have been slow to match a reduction in the prime lending rate, from
11 percent to 10{ percent, announced Monday by Chase Manhattan Bank
of New York.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 1 to 113\. On Tuesday the company announced

.27 to 183.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .04 at 366.07.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.95 to
2,514.61, extending its gain since the start of last week to 74.55
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the

<HEAD>Analyst Says Extending, Boosting Incentives Is Mistake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incentive packages on most of General Motors
Corp.'s cars and trucks have been boosted or extended in what one
analyst says may be the worst thing that the industry could do.
   GM issued new incentive offers for its Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick
and Oldsmobile cars on Tuesday, and for GMC trucks today. Cash
rebates range from $500 to $1,500, depending on the model, or a
buyer may choose financing ranging between 2.9 percent to 10.9
percent, depending on the term of the loan.
   All are effective today and run indefinitely, except for
financing deals on Chevrolet cars and trucks, which expire Sept. 27.
   Auto industry analyst John Kirnan, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in
New York, said manufacturers may sacrifice future sales by using
generous incentives now.
   ``The reason why we think the amplification in incentive activity
is bad is ... that you are going to take away some buyers from the
fourth quarter and early next year,'' Kirnan said today.
   Late last week, before GM's announcements, Kirnan said: ``The
worst thing that could happen is that if the industry would raise
the incentive activity.'' Chrysler Corp.'s current incentive program
runs indefinitely and Ford Motor Co.'s expires at the end of this
month.
   Automakers have been wrestling with a three-pronged problem this
year _ sales below expectations, overly ambitious production
schedules and incentives that have lost their luster. All that has
added up to larger than desired dealer new-car inventories.
   These things, combined with expectations that interest rates will
drop further in the near future, might make the autumn a better time
to buy a car, economists say.
   Incentives have been used on and off all year, with the biggest
push being made during the spring. Within days of each other in late
March and early April of this year, GM, Ford and Chrysler announced
incentive programs that increased the number of qualified vehicles,
boosted cash rebates and drastically lowered interest rates.
   But sale figures through the second-quarter of the year and into
the third quarter indicated the enticements weren't boosting sales
to expectations and vehicles were getting backlogged on dealer lots.
The eight major domestic automakers had sold 19 percent fewer cars
and light trucks during the first half of this year compared with
the same time last year.
   According to this week's Ward's Automotive Reports, dealers for
those companies had a 75-day supply of cars on hand at the current
selling rate on June 30, the same level as they had two years ago
but far above the 60-day supply at the same time last year.
   Those companies made 72.6 percent of all the new cars sold during
the first six months of this year, and 72.1 percent last year.
Typically, inventories of imported cars are smaller.
   GM dealers had a new-car inventory of 79 days at the end of last
month, Ford had a 78-day supply and Chrysler's inventory was at 79
days, Ward's said.

financial position as it continues its program of comprehensive

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge On Exchange-Ordered Selling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices for July delivery recovered
slightly after falling sharply in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade following the exchange's emergency order requiring
traders to reduce their holdings in that contract.
   Prices of other soybean contracts were moderately lower while the
corn and wheat markets were down slightly. Oat futures advanced.
   The Board of Trade issued the emergency order late Tuesday to
break up an apparent attempt by one large company to corner the
soybean market. Officials have not named the company.
   The July soybean contract tumbled 31 cents a bushel on heavy
selling at the opening. Analysts attributed much of that selling to
major grain companies holding large commitments to take delivery of
soybeans in July.
   But the losses were quickly trimmed, apparently on buying by
other parties holding large commitments to deliver soybeans in July.
The exchange's emergency order applies to those in either position.
   ``It's kind of wild and wooly here,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager
of floor operations for the trading company Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Activity was relatively light in the other markets as traders
exercised caution ahead of this afternoon's Agriculture Department
report on planted crop acreage.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1} cents lower with July at $2.57{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1} cents lower with July at $1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to
24 cents lower with July down 24 cents at $7.02 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August at
70.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent higher
with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .20 cent
higher with July at 47.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .63 cent higher with July at 29.45 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Tuesday while pork futures fell.

   The fate of Time Inc. rests in the hands
of a Delaware judge who must decide if the media giant can dismiss a
$12.2 billion hostile bid from Paramount Communications Inc. and
proceed with its own $14 billion tender offer for Warner
Communications Inc.
   On Wall Street _ which intently watched a Delaware Chancery Court
hearing Tuesday for signs of how Judge William T. Allen might rule _
traders were already betting that Paramount would lose.
   Time stock skidded $6.37{ a share to $146.25 in New York Stock
Exchange trading as Allen heard arguments on requests by attorneys
for Paramount and some Time shareholders for an injunction to block
Time's $70-a-share offer for Warner.
   The drop in Time's stock price indicated that pessimistic
investors were taking whatever profits they could before Allen's
ruling, which is expected later this week.
   In early trading today, Time stock recovered some ground, moving
up $3 a share to $149.25. Analysts said the gain likely was a
response to Tuesday's sharp declne.
   Warner stock was down 25 cents to $62.62{ a share in early
trading today, and Paramount was up 25 cents to $58.25 a share.
   The attorneys for Paramount and the shareholders contended
Tuesday that Time's directors violated their duty in refusing to let
shareholders vote on Paramount's $200-a-share bid.
   The lawyers claimed that the Time board effectively put the
company up for sale when it agreed to a stock-swap merger with
Warner in March. Under Delaware law, if a company is up for sale,
its board must entertain any bids that would fetch the most money
for shareholders.
   Melvyn Cantor, representing Paramount, charged that Time
officials knew they were opening the company up to possible bids
when they included a provision in the merger agreement with Warner
calling for an exchange of stock between the two companies.
   Michael R. Klein, an attorney representing Texas investor Robert
M. Bass and other major Time shareholders, said the exchange was
``done to defend the transaction.''
   Klein said of Time's directors, ``When they made that choice (to
pursue the merger with Warner) they were quite substantially aware
that the marketplace would supply alternatives.''
   Time attorney Robert Joffee dismissed Klein's arguments. ``The
mere possibility that someone might make a bid _ even the making of
a bid _ does not put a company into play,'' he said.
   The Paramount and shareholder attorneys repeatedly asked Allen to
allow the holders of Time stock to vote on the Paramount offer.
   Sherri R. Savett, also representing stockholders, argued that
they should be allowed to vote on the two offers because they stood
to lose a lot of money if the Time-Warner merger succeeded and the
Paramount bid failed.
   Joffee countered that if the Paramount offer does fall through,
it would happen because Paramount's bid remains subject to a number
of conditions _ including obtaining regulatory approvals to operate
Time's cable television systems.
   Warner attorney Charles Richards said it was Warner and not
Paramount shareholders who had the most to lose. The failure of the
Time bid would send Warner stock tumbling and open the company up to
an unwanted bid, Richards said.
   Time and Warner had planned to submit their original merger plan
to their shareholders, but the companies changed the agreement, in
response to the Paramount bid, to the tender offer by Time for
Warner stock.
   The attorneys for Time and Warner told the judge the directors
did not violate their duty to shareholders because Delaware law does
not require the board to submit either Paramount's offer or the
Warner bid to a vote.
   Joffee contended the company never was for sale. He said the
proposed merger of Time and Warner was the result of longterm
business planning and said the law did not require the company to
shift its strategy because it receives an apparently lucrative bid.
   He said Time also doesn't have to submit the Warner deal to a
vote because it does not require the dilution of Time stock.
   The courtroom was filled to overflowing with 120 spectators,
mostly reporters and stock arbitragers who are speculating on the
outcome of the takeover battle. Many stood against walls or crouched
in the aisles.
   The crowd was so big that about 30 people were shut out and
forced to wait in the hallway and it so strained the air
conditioning system that Allen invited lawyers at one point in the
5{-hour hearing to take off their jackets.
   Many arbitragers were unable to confer with their offices during
the hearing because they were not allowed to bring cellular
telephones into the courtroom and couldn't leave the room for fear
of losing their place to someone from the hallway.
   Allen's decision _ which undoubtedly will be appealed to Delaware
Supreme Court _ could decide the outcome of the three-way struggle
for Time and could affect the future of friendly mergers in the
future, as many of the nation's largest companies are incorporated
here.

<HEAD>Controversy Flares In Netherlands Over Smog Emergency Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public controversy has flared in
this densely populated nation over a government study that
recommends banning virtually all daytime car and truck traffic in
the event of a serious smog emergency.
   The study, which follows one of the Netherlands' worst bouts of
traffic-induced smog last month, was criticized by one business
group as an attempt to ``shut down the Netherlands, Inc.'' by
disrupting the vital trucking industry.
   The government study, presented to Environment Minister Ed
Nijpels on Tuesday, contained the first detailed plan on how
authorities should respond if parts of the country are hit by
dangerously high smog levels in the future.
   In the harshest of the proposed measures, the study suggested
provincial governors should halt all car and truck traffic in their
areas from 6 a.m. to midnight and allow only emergency vehicles and
doctors on the roads.
   The measure would be enforced by closing down dozens of bridges
and tunnels, effectively crippling traffic in this nation
crisscrossed by rivers and canals, according to the Amsterdam
newspaper Trouw.
   If such a measure ever took effect, it would be the first driving
ban since 1974, when the government banned all but emergency driving
on Sundays in a response to an Arab oil embargo imposed for the
Netherlands' strong support for Israel.
   Marijke Brunt of the Nature and Environment Foundation, this
nation's most prominent green lobby group, said on Wednesday that
she was ``extremely pleased'' with the government study.
   However, ``If you halt all traffic, you effectively shut down the
Netherlands, Inc.'' said Marcel Braakman of the Royal Dutch
Association of Entrepreneurs.
   Braakman predicted widespread disruption to commuter traffic and
supplies ranging from groceries to building materials if the
proposals were ever to come into effect.
   The EVO trucking organization said that the anti-smog measures
would cause ``gigantic economic damage.''
   The Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, based in the world's
largest port, complained in an editorial that the proposed measures
would ``hit some branches of Dutch industry disproportionately
hard.''
   In last month's emergency, concentrations of toxic nitrous oxides
and ozone reached dangerous highs in at least five Dutch provinces
while an orange haze settled over the nation. Doctors and hospitals
reported the elderly and asthma patients were having serious
breathing problems.
   A fresh breeze from the North Sea cleared the putrid air after a
few days, but Nijpels convened an emergency meeting with the
governors of the two worst affected provinces to decide on possible
measures.
   Last May, the center-right government of Premier Ruud Lubbers
became the first in the western world to fall over an environmental
issue, the funding of a plan to clean up the heavily polluted
environment within a generation.
   Ms. Brunt dismissed criticism of the government smog study as
``ridiculous.
   ``Suddenly, everybody (in the business world) has lost interest
in the environment when it was the hottest topic around before,''
she said.

   The United Mine Workers union today
extended a sanctioned work stoppage for two more days, meaning about
60,000 coal miners east of the Mississippi River will be off their
jobs at least through Friday.
   Howard Green, international executive board member from UMW
District 17, said the contractually permitted ``memorial period'' is
being extended to give the Pittston Co. more time to respond to a
request by Virginia's governor that the company and the union resume
negotiations.
   ``Unfortunately, in southwest Virginia _ where the primary
purpose of the law appears to be the defense of corporate privilege
at the expense of individual liberty _ the conditions which led to
this protest have, if anything, gotten worse,'' UMW President
Richard Trumka said in a news release.
   Telephone calls to the office of Pittston spokeswoman Susan
Copeland in Lebanon, Va., were not immediately returned.
   The memorial period, called last week, originally was intended to
end at midnight tonight. Since being called, violence has continued
in the coal fields and state police beefed up patrols.
   More than 37,000 UMW members in eight states have been on wildcat
strikes in support of 1,900 miners on striking The Pittston Co. in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   In Alabama, police said up to six shots were fired today at a
coal-loading facility where union miners were harassing non-union
haulers. A shot fired from 300-to-400 yards away struck a coal truck
but no injuries were reported, officers said.
   About 30 state troopers were assigned to the southern West
Virginia coal fields Tuesday after rock-throwing and other violence,
primarily in Raleigh, Boone, Mingo and Logan counties.
   Lt. Col. G.R. Young said the violence amounted to ``just about
the same thing that has been going on during the past few weeks _ a
few rocks being thrown, some broken windows, some flattened tires.''
   In Boone County, state police responded late Tuesday evening to
the C&amp;T Coal Co. at Nellis where two trucks and a bulldozer were on
fire.
   Trooper R.L. Richard said no injuries were reported.
   In Washington, Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the House
Subcommittee on Labor Management Relations will begin an
investigation into the Pittston strike.
   ``Given the length of the strike, the number of workers involved,
the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts and
the potential effect of the strike on the economy, I believe it is
time for a congressional investigation of the matter,'' Clay said.
   A National Labor Relations Board regional office filed complaints
Friday against both the UMW and Pittston.
   Pittson was accused of unfair labor practices such as coercion
and bad faith bargaining, a position that, if upheld, would bar the
company from hiring permanent replacements for the striking union
members.
   The union, the complaint said, has engaged in illegal picket
activity.
   Both the union and Pittston said they will fight the complaints.
   UMW President Richard Trumka last week called for a three-day
``memorial period'' for union miners east of the Mississippi to stay
off the job through today.
   The U.S. Energy Information Agency reported that U.S. coal
production fell 35 percent in Eastern coal fields during the week
ending July 1. Production in West Virginia was down 37 percent from
prestrike levels, from 3 million tons a week before the wildcat
strikes began to 1.9 million tons.
   That reduced production has meant few or no shipments to power
plants that burn coal.
   Virginia Power Co. spokeswoman Karen Russell said her company
normally maintains stockpiles of enough coal to burn for 35 to 65
days, and ``we're now at about the midpoint.''
   The utility, which produces 45 percent of its power from
coal-burning plants, has 1.7 million customers in Virginia and North
Carolina.
   American Electric Power Co., the nation's largest coal customer,
has seen its stockpile drop from about 70 days to 65, said spokesman
Carl Crawford.
   ``We're not down significantly,'' Crawford said. ``We're getting
some fuel supply deliveries, but at reduced levels.''
   American Electric Power's eight operating divisions serve 7
million customers in Ohio, West Virgina, Indiana, Kentucky,
Michigan, Virginia and Tennessee.
   Trumka said Tuesday he was accepting a request by Virginia Gov.
Gerald Baliles that the union and Pittston resume negotiations under
the supervision of a federal mediator, with Trumka and Pittston
Chairman Paul Douglas heading the negotiating teams.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said the company had
no comment on the proposal. ``At the appropriate time, we'll make a
response,'' Odom said.
   Pittston, which has demanded cutbacks that the union fears would
set an industry-wide precedent, has rejected other requests that the
two sides resume talks or that Douglas become personally involved in
the negotiations.
   In Charleston, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp indefinitely
postponed strike-related proceedings in his court.
   ``I thought it might very well help the situation if all legal
proceedings are suspended for the time being,'' Knapp said. ``I
don't want to impede those who are trying to end these strikes.''

<HEAD>Fannie Mae Reports Sharply Higher Quarterly Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fannie Mae reported Wednesday that earnings
soared 60 percent in the second quarter as yields increased on its
mortgage portfolio and fee income rose.
   Fannie Mae, formally known as the Federal National Mortgage
Association, is a congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned,
company that provides money for homebuyers by purchasing mortgages
from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to
investors.
   Fannie Mae's earnings totaled $193.0 million, or $2.28 per share,
on interest income of $2.7 billion, for the three months ended June
30. That compared with a profit of $120.7 million, or $1.53 a share,
on interest income of $2.54 billion, in the 1988 quarter.
   For the first six months of 1989, Fannie Mae earned $358.2
million, or $4.27 per share, on total interest income of $5.35
billion. The same period last year Fannie Mae earned $221.6 million,
or $2.82 a share, on total interest income of $4.98 billion.
   Fannie Mae President Roger Birk attributed the sharp rise in
second-quarter earnings to a widening in the spread between the
interest the company earns on its investment portfolio and what it
pays on its debt.
   Another factor was an increase in income from fees charged
lenders for guaranteeing morgage backed securities, he said.
   Fannie Mae purchased $4.5 billion in mortgages in the second
quarter, up from $3.4 billion in the first but down from $6.9
billion a year ago.

   The stock market showed no clear-cut trend today,
hesitating after a six-session rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 74.55 points over the
past six trading days, rose another 7.96 to 2,522.57 by 2 p.m. today
on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 683 up, 699 down and 533
unchanged.
   Analysts said traders who were skeptical about the staying power
of the market's recent upswing were cashing in some of the gains in
stock prices.
   They also noted some uncertainty over whether interest rates
would keep declining in the near future as steadily as they have in
the recent past.
   A rally in bond prices bogged down Tuesday after the yield on
long-term Treasury bonds briefly dipped below 8 percent.
   In addition, brokers noted that other large money-center banks
have been slow to match a reduction in the prime lending rate, from
11 percent to 10{ percent, announced Monday by Chase Manhattan Bank
of New York.
   Computer Associates dropped 1{ to 16} on volume of more than 4
million shares. On Tuesday the company said growth in its revenues
slowed during the fiscal quarter ended June 30.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 1| to 113~. On Tuesday the company
announced plans for a 2-for-1 stock split and a dividend increase.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .07 to 183.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .35 at 366.38.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.50 million shares with two

   London shares again ended at a post-crash closing
high Wednesday, as traders continued to ponder the repercussions of
Tuesday's 13 billion pound, or $21 billion, bid for BAT Industries
PLC.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was 5.8 points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,256.7, but sharply down
from an early high of 2,272.7. At its lowest, the index was 0.7
points lower at 2,251.6.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended up 8.0 points at
1,858.3. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.19 points to
close at 1,276.98.
   The market closed at 4 p.m., one hour earlier than usual, because
of a strike by British transport workers.
   Dealers said early buying interest, which was a continuation of
the market's almost 60-point surge Tuesday, subsided as
profit-takers entered the fray.
   ``The market decided to consolidate recent gains,'' one London
dealer said. ``If it's going to push higher it needs to be sure it's
on a firm footing.''
   Many traders blamed the transport strike for containing activity,
although volume came to a buoyant 728.5 million shares by the close,
compared with 639.3 million shares Tuesday.
   ``The market's still in the bid frame of mind,'' one trader said,
``and looks pretty solid at these levels.''
   BAT shares fell 23 pence, or 37 cents, to finish at 877 pence. An
investor group led by financier Sir James Goldsmith is offering
securities worth 850 pence, or about $13.77, for each BAT share.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Drift Lower In Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted lower in uninspired
European trading Wednesday as dealers awaited a spate of U.S.
economic figures due Friday.
   Gold prices also declined.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed back to what they
called the middle of its present trading range.
   ``There was absolutely no reason (for the retreat) except that
people didn't want to go higher yet,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank
in Frankfurt. ``They see no room to move on the upside or on the
downside, so everybody is waiting that something will come out
Friday that will revive the market.''
   Friday's figures, which include June producer prices, retail
sales, industrial production and capacity utilization, will be
scrutinized for further signs that the U.S. economy is slowing,
dealers said.
   They said they were keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal
Reserve in case it decides to take further steps to relax monetary
policy after last week's slight easing.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.88 yen to a closing 140.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted lower at 139.85 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6255 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6270 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8755 West German marks, down from 1.8795; 1.6135 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6160; 6.3645 French francs, down from 6.3740; 2.1160
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1180 1.1897 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1903; and 1,361.50 Italian lire, down from 1,364.50.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $379.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $380.25. In Zurich, gold fell to
$379.50 an ounce from $379.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 91 cents to close at a bid
$380.87 an ounce.
   Silver closed in London at $5.27 a troy ounce, unchanged from
late Tuesday.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish securities regulators are
investigating a unit of the U.S. brokerage firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. over allegations it misrepresented itself in the stock
sale of the petroleum giant Repsol S.A., a report published
Wednesday said.
   The newspaper El Pais quoted unnamed sources from the National
Securities Commission as alleging that last spring Drexel sold
Repsol shares intended for small investors to a few large private
institutions.
   The newspaper's sources said Drexel requested an estimated $59.8
million in shares of the state-controlled Repsol to be sold to 400
investors. But they claimed that on May 11, the first day of public
trading, Drexel improperly sold the shares to a small number of
large private investors, the newspaper said.
   There was no comment on the report at Drexel's Spanish office.
   However, Repsol issued a statement late Wednesday denying Drexel
formed part of the syndicate of 48 brokerages or investment firms
that took part in the stock sale.
   ``Drexel Burnham Lambert did not form part of the offering, thus,
there has been no relation at all between that firm and Repsol,'' it
said. ``Repsol has cooperated since the start of the (commission's)
investigation (in early June) and based on its outcome will then
take the appropriate legal action.''
   Between April 20 and May 6, Repsol, Europe's eighth-largest
petroleum company, sold 79.75 million shares at $14.70 each to
400,000 shareholders worldwide.
   The company sold 44 million of the total shares offered to
individual Spanish shareholders under a pro-rated system.
   El Pais said the sources confirmed the commission had contacted
at least 10 of the 400 investors Drexel had identified as original
buyers. They said they knew nothing about ordering the purchase of
Repsol shares.
   El Pais said if Drexel used the names of investors without their
consent the brokerage could face criminal fraud charges.
   The secretary of the NSC president Luis Carlos Croissier said
there was no one available to comment on the newspaper report.
   In the United States, Drexel recently agreed to plead guilty to
charges involving securities fraud violations stemming from the
insider trading scandals linked to the now-jailed speculator Ivan F.
Boesky. Drexel also agreed to pay $650 million in penalties.

<HEAD>CBS Earnings Fall 8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. posted an 8 percent drop in
second-quarter profit due mainly to higher prime time programming
costs, the company said Wednesday.
   For the April-June period, CBS's net earnings totaled $118.8
million, or $4.62 a share, down from $128.7 million, or $5.01 a
share, in the same 1988 period.
   Revenue rose to $771.9 million from $740.8 million in the
year-earlier quarter.
   For the first six months of 1989, the broadcasting company's net
income plunged to $174.9 million, or $6.80 a share, from $1.04
billion, or $40.43 a share in the first half of last year. The 1988
figure included an $866.6 million gain from the sale of CBS Records
to Sony Corp.
   CBS cited an extraordinary loss of $200,000 in the first six
months of 1989 to pay down debt.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive, blamed a
strike by the Writers Guild of America for forcing up prime time
programming costs. He said the CBS television network's operating
income dropped as a result.
   The CBS Broadcast Group recorded an 11 percent quarterly drop in
operating profits to $137.9 million from $155.2 million in the
second quarter of 1988.
   The writers' strike delayed the start of the 1988-89 television
season, causing an uncommonly high percentage of first-run regular
series programming on the network schedule during the second
quarter, Tisch said.
   He also attributed the lower operating profits in the broadcast
group to the quick four-game finish of the National Basketball
Association championship, compared the seven-game finals in 1988.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Nosedive In Exchange-Ordered Selling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed dramatically lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade following the exchange's
emergency order requiring traders to reduce holdings in contracts
for July delivery.
   Corn and oat futures prices were narrowly mixed while wheat
futures fell moderately.
   The Board of Trade issued the emergency order late Tuesday in a
move widely perceived as an attempt to crush one company's attempt
to corner the soybean market. Exchange officials would not name the
company.
   Soybeans for delivery in July closed 40 cents lower at $6.86 a
bushel. Other contracts closed 25{ cents lower to 7 cents higher.
   Analysts noted that overnight rainfall in the western reaches of
the Corn Belt also may have prompted some selling of soybeans and
corn.
   ``Certainly the extent of the decline in July was precipitated by
this ruling. But I think the market had reason to drop despite this
ruling,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Trading in other market was cautious ahead of an Agriculture
Department report on planted crop acreage. The report, released
after the close, pegged soybean acreage at 61.3 million acres and
corn acreage at 72.8 million acres.
   The soybean number was lower than expected and analysts said it
could spark buying of new-crop futures on Thursday. The corn number
was larger than expected and was pronounced bearish for the corn
market.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 7{ cents lower with July at
$3.88 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to 6 cents higher with July
at $2.55{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with
July at $1.43} a bushel.

   The dollar drifted lower in quiet dealings
Wednesday as traders awaited a barrage of government data expected
to shed more light on the economy's direction.
   Gold prices also declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery fell $2.80 to $378.70 a troy
ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of gold
at $377.40 an ounce, down from $379.
   Currency dealers said profit-taking and other internal market
influences were largely responsible for the dollar's decline.
   However, trading was described as thin, with many dealers keeping
a low profile until Friday's release of government reports on June
producer prices, retail sales, industrial production and capacity
utilization.
   The data will be scrutinzed to determine whether the Federal
Reserve will continue to loosen its credit policies by lowering
interest rates to prevent the economy from falling into a recession,
dealers say.
   ``After the news comes out the end of the week ... I would say
the Fed will err on the easier side,'' said Ronald H. Holzer, chief
dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   Lower interest rates tend to depress the dollar partly because
they make dollar-denominated securities such as stocks and bonds
less attractive to foreign investors, thereby decreasing the need to
convert their currencies into dollars.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.88 yen to a closing 140.50 yen. It was quoted at
139.85 yen in London, and at 139.60 yen in New York, down from
140.75 Tuesday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. It cost $1.6255
to buy one pound in London, down from $1.6270 late Tuesday. Sterling
fetched $1.6300 in New York, up from $1.6235.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.8745 West German marks, down from 1.8835;
1.6135 Swiss francs, down from 1.6190; 1.18955 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.19055; 6.3575 French francs, down from 6.3840; and
1,359.00 Italian lire, down from 1,365.025.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday,
included: 1.8755 West German marks, down from 1.8795; 1.6135 Swiss

   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $379.75 an ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $380.25. In Zurich, it declined to
$379.50 an ounce from $379.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 91 cents to close at a bid
$380.87 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On the New York Comex, silver bullion

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude and heating oil futures prices fell
Wednesday, pushed down by technically motivated selling, while
gasoline futures moved higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate dropped 38 cents to settle at $20.15 per
42-gallon barrel. The benchmark U.S. grade of crude went up 17 cents
on Tuesday after going down 39 cents on Monday.
   Other contract months of West Texas Intermediate crude also
declined.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange posted mixed
results.
   The August contract for home heating oil slid 0.34 cent to 48.94
cents a gallon after jumping 0.49 cent on Tuesday, partially
offsetting a 0.98 cent loss in the previous session.
   Bucking the energy market's downtrend, wholesale unleaded
gasoline for August delivery rose 0.79 cent to 57.41 cents a gallon.
The gain added to Tuesday's 0.16 cent-increase, which followed a
drop of 0.13 cent on Monday.
   Chris McCormack, an energy analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said technical factors were behind the selloff in the crude
and heating oil futures pits.
   ``I didn't see any news today that I would term bearish for the
market. I think the market just stalled out,'' said McCormack.
   He said the selling seemed to beget more selling as the contracts
moved to progressively lower levels.
   The decline in crude prices paradoxically occured despite report
of an unexpectedly sharp drawdown in crude oil inventories. In a
weekly report issued after energy markets closed Tuesday, the
American Petroleum Institute said the nation's crude oil stocks fell
2.3 million barrels to 331.6 million.
   Gasoline may have benefited from the latest inventory and
consumption statistics from the API. A perception that a surge in
summer gasoline demand might tax the operating capacity of U.S.
refineries also has supported gas futures.
   The API's weekly report showed gasoline inventories were down
nearly 5.2 million barrels in the latest week to 215.1 million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist-ruled Hungary has taken another step
along the capitalist road by letting its National Bank set up a
mutual fund that will include securities issued by the country's
private firms.
   The announcement was made Wednesday by the International Finance
Corp., a unit of the World Bank, which is owned by 133 governments
including both Hungary and the United States.
   It coincided with a visit to Hungary by President Bush, who
saluted that country's strides toward economic freedom and pledged
to open U.S. markets to Hungarian goods.
   Monique Amaudry, a spokeswoman for International Finance Corp.,
said the Hungarian government will own shares of some companies the
fund will invest in, but will not hold a majority stake.
   She said the fund, called the First Hungarian Fund Ltd., would be
the first of its kind among the Communist-ruled countries of eastern
Europe.
   ``The fund is an offshoot of Hungary's privatization program,''
Amaudry said.
   She said the fund will be closed-end, meaning no new investors
will be accepted after the corporation and financial advisor Bear
Stearns and Co. Inc. of New York have placed the shares. Amaudry
said the minimum investment is $500,000.
   The National Bank of Hungary is expected to protect investors for
about five years against the loss of their principal, and against
the possibility of the Hungarian forint, the national currency,
dropping in value against the U.S. dollar.
   Ms. Amaudry said it is not expected that the shares of the
Hungary fund will be traded on markets.
   The International Finance Corp. said it would invest $7.5 million
in the new fund, 15 percent of the fund's $50 million target.
   The corporation makes loans to private companies in Third World
countries, and to some companies run along private lines but owned
largely by Communist governments. It often buys a small number of
shares in such companies.
   Already it has made four investments in Hungary, including stock
in Unicbank, a Hungarian commercial bank opened two years ago.

   An afternoon round of buying Wednesday carried
the stock market to new highs since the 1987 crash, keeping Wall
Street's July winning streak intact through a seventh straight
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.02 points to
2,532.63, surpassing its previous post-crash peak of 2,531.87 on
June 23.
   Over the seven trading days since the end of last month the
average has risen 92.57 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
844 up, 610 down and 539 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.55 million
shares, down from 171.59 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.83 million shares.
   Early in the day, analysts said, traders who were skeptical about
the staying power of the market's recent upswing cashed in some of
their gains.
   They also noted some uncertainty over whether interest rates
would keep declining in the near future as steadily as they have in
the recent past.
   A rally in bond prices bogged down Tuesday after the yield on
long-term Treasury bonds briefly dipped below 8 percent. Yields
hovered late Wednesday in the 8.02 percent-8.06 percent range.
   But when the widely expected pullback in the stock market
produced no concerted selling, buyers once again stepped in.
   Computer Associates led the active list, down 1] at 16~ on volume
of more than 7.6 million shares. On Tuesday the company said growth
in its revenues slowed during the fiscal quarter ended June 30.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 2{ to 114}. The company announced plans
Tuesday for a 2-for-1 stock split and a dividend increase.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up ~ at 114}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up

   CBS Inc. added ~ to 210{, joining 124 other NYSE issues at new
52-week highs although the company reported lower second-quarter
earnings.
   Airline issues pulled back a bit after a sharp rise of late
fueled by takeover speculation. UAL fell 1~ to 163}; AMR { to 62\,
and Delta Air Lines 1\ to 70.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $11.00 billion, or 0.34

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks picked
up .53 to 184.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.47 to 376.24, and S&amp;P's

<HEAD>Plans to File Reorganization Plan Before July 21</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines plans to submit a bankruptcy
reorganization plan before July 21, an attorney representing the
strikebound carrier said Wednesday.
   Attorney Deryck Palmer told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland at a hearing that the airline would file the plan prior to
the July 21 end of its exclusivity period, during which competing
plans may not be filed.
   Under bankruptcy law, a company has 60 days after it files a
restructuring plan to seek creditor approval of the plan. Rival
plans also can't be filed during that period.
   Last Wednesday, Lifland agreed to a joint request by Eastern and
its major creditors to extend the exclusivity period for two weeks,
through July 21, after they indicated they were nearing agreement on
a restructuring plan.
   A company seeking Chapter 11 protection has the sole right to
submit a reorganization plan to the court during the first 120 days
of its case, after which other parties may propose plans.
   Eastern's reorganization is centered around its plan for
operating at about two-thirds its pre-strike size and addresses how
creditors would be repaid and shareholders treated.
   Eastern wants to pay creditors with the proceeds of about $1.8
billion in asset sales, including several that already have been
approved by the bankruptcy court.
   The airline also announced Wednesday that its passenger traffic
in June exceeded expectations, apparently attempting to show the
success of their rebuilding despite the strike. The carrier said it
flew 252.2 million revenue passenger miles, a measurement of airline
capacity.
   At the hearing, Lifland postponed until Aug. 1 consideration of
the Eastern pilots union's request that a trustee be appointed to
take over operation of the airline.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9,
five days after the start of the strike.
   The pilots filed a motion seeking appointment of a trustee soon
after the strike began but consideration repeatedly has been
postponed by Lifland.
   The latest request for a postponement was made by David I.
Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, because he is
conducting contract negotiations in Washington between the company
and the three striking unions. The talks began several weeks ago
with Eastern and the pilots union, and were broadened Monday to
include its Machinists and flight attendants.
   ``The parties are engaged in intense negotiation,'' Lifland said.
Appointing a trustee at this time ``would be like adding on a fifth
engine with reverse thrust; I don't see any point to that,'' he said.
   Also Wednesday, the Transport Workers Union, which represents the
6,200 Eastern flight attendants, announced it has contracted labor
strategist Ray Rogers and his firm Corporate Campaign Inc. to launch
a ``multidimensional offensive'' against Eastern owner Frank Lorenzo.
   The union said the actions against Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., will include an ``international boycott'' of
Eastern, its sister carrier Continental Airlines and Scandinavian
Airlines System, which holds about a 10 percent stake in Texas Air.

<HEAD>July Soybean Futures Plummet In Forced Selling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soybean Corner Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices tumbled Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade following the exchange's emergency order that traders reduce
their holdings in contracts for July delivery.
   The order was perceived as a move to crush an alleged attempt to
corner the soybean market.
   Wheat futures also retreated while corn and oat futures ended
mixed ahead of an Agriculture Department crop report that traders
pronounced bullish for soybeans and bearish for corn.
   On other markets, coffee futures sank to a new eight-year low;
precious metals prices fell; energy futures were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   In Chicago, soybeans for delivery in July settled 39{ cents lower
at $6.86{ a bushel in a session marked by fitful trading with the
heaviest selling near the opening and the close. Other contracts
ended 25{ cents lower to 7 cents higher.
   The Board of Trade issued an emergency order late Tuesday
requiring all traders to reduce their July soybean positions to 3
million bushels by the end of trading Tuesday and to 1 million
bushels by Thursday, the expiration date for the July contract.
   Exchange officials would not explain the reasons behind the move.
But a number of traders and analysts said it seemed designed to
prevent a single party from gaining control of the market.
   Published reports claimed the target of the exchange's order was
Ferruzzi SPA, a huge Italian agricultural and financial firm that is
one of the world's biggest soybean processors. But Ferruzzi stated
it had not tried to corner the market and protested the Board of
Trade's order.
   Analysts noted that overnight rainfall in the western Corn Belt
also may have prompted some selling of soybeans and corn.
   ``I think the market had reason to drop despite this ruling,''
said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   Trading in other grain markets was cautious ahead of an
Agriculture Department report on planted crop acreage. The report
pegged soybean acreage at 61.3 million acres and corn acreage at
72.8 million acres.
   The soybean number was lower than expected and analysts said it
could spark buying of new-crop soybean futures on Thursday. The corn
number was higher than expected and was pronounced bearish.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 7{ cents lower with July at $3.88 a
bushel; corn was 3\ cents lower to 5\ cents higher with July at
$2.55} a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 2\ cents higher with July
at $1.43} a bushel.
   Coffee futures skidded on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid talk that Mexico had sold up to 300,000 132-pound bags
of unroasted coffee beans.
   Some traders perceived the rumored sale as an escalation of a war
for market share following the collapse of an international
price-support agreement last week.
   Coffee settled 2.34 cents to 3.63 cents lower with July at 85.25
cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell moderately on New York's
Commodity Exchange in trading inspired by technical factors and the
absence of new supply-and-demand developments. The drop in soybean
and crude oil prices, portending lower food and fuel prices, may
also have prompted selling of the inflation-sensitive precious
metals, analysts said
   Gold settled $2.80 to $2.90 lower with August at $380.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 6.9 cents to 8.1 cents lower with July at $5.188 a
troy ounce.
   Crude and heating oil futures prices fell on the New York
Mercantile Exchange while gasoline futures moved higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 38 cents
lower with August at $20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .34 cent to
.57 cent lower with August at 48.94 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .32 cent to .79 cent lower with August at 57.41 cents a
gallon.
   Most cattle futures prices advanced on expectations that supplies
will decline sharply in August. Most pork futures retreated on signs
of sluggish retail demand.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .60 cent higher with August
at 70.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to .80 cent
higher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .33 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with July at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent lower to .02 cent higher with July at 28.87
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Settlements totaling $89.5 million have been
reached in ``greenmail'' lawsuits by Walt Disney Co. shareholders
against the Disney board of directors and Wall Street financier Saul
Steinberg, the parties announced Wednesday.
   Suits brought by present and former Disney shareholders alleged
they lost millions when Disney ended a Steinberg-led takeover
attempt in 1984 by paying a premium price to buy out his Disney
stock.
   Of the settlements _ which are subject to court approval and
mainly will be paid by insurors _ $29.5 million will be split among
thousands of former Disney shareholders included in a class action
suit that claimed the stockholders sold their shares at a loss when
Disney stock plunged after the hostile bid by Steinberg's Reliance
Group Holdings Inc. was terminated.
   Burbank-based Disney will receive the other $60 million, although
a Disney attorney would not detail how that would happen. That
settlement stems from a derivative action brought by current Disney
stockholders.
   A statement the parties issued with the settlements and read by
Superior Court Judge Abby Soven said Disney acted ``in good faith''
during the takeover effort.
   Disney attorney Michael Diamond said the $60 million was ``a
recovery on behalf of the company,'' but he denied it was simply a
matter of money going into Disney's pocket.
   ``The company will not end up with cash out of the settlement,''
said Diamond. He did not address other kinds of consideration or
financing, but said the shareholders would be able to direct where
the company must use the money.
   The derivative action was to have been decided by the judge,
while jurors considered the case brought by former shareholders.
   Reliance, which has interests in insurance, real estate and
investing, issued a statement in New York saying its share of the
settlement was $20.8 million and it would take a pre-tax charge in
that amount against its second quarter earnings.
   The company stated it believed all its actions in the case were
lawful but it decided that settlement was more prudent than risking
the undertainties of a jury trial.
   Between March and June 1984, Steinberg bought up 12 percent of
Disney and announced his intent to take over the company and sell
off parts of it.
   The Disney board offered Steinberg $325 million for his shares, a
figure well above the market price. Steinberg accepted the offer and
made an estimated $60 million on the deal.
   Disney shares tumbled after news of Steinberg's buyout plunged
the stock almost 10 points. Thousands of shareholders who gambled on
a Disney buyout and change in management were caught unaware and
many decided to dump their stock at a loss.
   The lawsuit contended the Disney board violated a fiduciary trust
with its stockholders by paying ``greenmail'' to Steinberg. The
board replied that Steinberg was paid to prevent destruction of the
company.
   Attorneys for Disney and the plaintiffs declined to say how much
of the $29.5 million was being contributed by Disney, Reliance or
their insurers, but said shareholder reports and statements
eventually would disclose the amounts.
   ``Money is being paid on behalf of the directors, but no money is
being paid directly by Disney,'' Diamond said.
   Diamond said the principals in the matter, including Disney
banker Morgan Stanley, were indemnified against such actions.
   The settlements, ending five years of litigation in the matter,
came after three weeks of trial before Judge Soven. She told jurors
that attorneys in the matter were drawn to an agreement as the case
unfolded in court.
   The settlement ``contemplates a finding by the court that the
directors of the Walt Disney Co. in 1984 acted in good faith and in
what they believed to be in the best interest of the company,'' the
statement issued with the settlements read.
   Diamond said Disney would not have agreed to the settlement
without that statement of finding.
   In both cases, the settlement amounts include attorneys fees and
expenses.

<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday
gave tentative approval to a catchall tax bill that would raise $5.3
billion for deficit reduction next year.
   Before endorsing the measure on a voice vote, the panel, b a
22-11 vote, rejected President Bush's proposal to reduce the tax on
capital gains. Committee aides said a capital-gains reduction is
likely to be considered again before the committee takes final
action on the bill.
   By voice vote at a closed-door session, the committee eliminated
from the package a proposed extension of the 3 percent tax on local
and long distance telephone service. The tax is due to expire Dec.
31, 1990.
   Earlier in the day, the committee voted to repeal a requirement
that employers use complex tests to prove that their
health-insurance plans do not discriminate against lower-paid
employees. The Senate has approved similar changes in the law, known
as Section 89, and the Bush administration also favors the changes.
   The bill would not wipe out anti-discrimination requirements. It
would, instead, greatly simplify how employers may prove their plans
are fair.
   Most of the three dozen-plus revenue-raising provisions in the
tax package, drafted by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee
chairman, are technical changes affecting corporations. Others would
raise taxes on users of snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco, halt a
scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and air cargo, and
impose income tax withholding on some farm workers who now are
exempt.
   Committee aides said that before the package is completed, the
panel probably will vote on an amendment that would eliminate the
tobacco-tax increase. Also, members are likely to offer dozens of
amendments of their own, including one that would repeal the new tax
older Americans pay for insurance to protect against catastrophic
medical expenses.
   In addition, an effort will be made to retain at least some part
of a tax benefit for employee stock-ownership plans that
Rostenkowski has proposed to repeal.
   The bill tentatively approved by the committee would end the tax
exclusion that lenders now are allowed for half the interest earned
on loans used to buy company stock for an ESOP. It also would wipe
out the employer deduction for dividends paid on stock held by an
ESOP.
   Those two provisions would raise more than $1.6 billion of the
$5.3 billion that the committee is required to generate for deficit
reduction in the budget year that begins Oct. 1.
   Other parts of the bill, which are not subject to change, would
impose a 3-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic crude oil and imported oil,
repeal the completed-contract accounting break for defense
contractors, and require that certain types of deferred income be
subject to Social Security taxes.
   Repeal of the anti-discrimination tests for health-insurance
plans is a major goal of business organizations, which consider the
rules overly complicated and costly to administer.
   Congress enacted the rules in 1986 to expand the number of
workers covered by health insurance, but some employers say the
rules instead will force them to drop health plans.
   Members of Congress were concerned that highly compensated
employees should not receive an unduly large share of the
$30-billion-plus annual federal tax subsidy for employer-paid health
insurance. The law considers any worker who earns more than $54,300
a year to be highly compensated.
   The rules were to take effect Jan. 1 but became such a source of
controversy that the Treasury Department delayed their
implementation until Oct. 1.
   The Ways and Means Committee bill would delay any testing of
health plans until Jan. 1.
   After that date, a health plan would be considered
non-discriminatory if made available to 90 percent of all employees
and the employer paid at least 50 percent of the premium. In
addition, the annual premium charged a worker earning under $20,000
a year could not exceed $1,000 for a policy covering only the worker
and $2,000 for a family policy.
   A higher-paid worker who received a benefit greater than allowed
under the formula would have to include the excess in taxable income.
   The committee legislation includes a special break for small
business. The health plan of a business with fewer than 20 workers
would be considered non-discriminatory if the employer provides
coverage for all employees and contributes the same dollar amount or
percentage of premium to all.
   The House legislation includes separate requirements for
cafeteria plans, under which employees may choose from among
benefits that include cash and health coverage. A plan would be
acceptable if basic health coverage were available to 90 percent of
all employees and if the average benefit for higher-paid workers did
not exceed 150 percent of that given other employees.

<HEAD>Developer To Plead Guilty In Vernon Savings Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dallas real estate developer has agreed to plead
guilty to federal fraud charges stemming from the investigation of
defunct Vernon Savings and Loan Association, the FBI said Wednesday.
   Jack D. Atkinson agreed to plead guilty to a criminal information
filed in federal court alleging that he lied about the purpose of a
loan he received from Vernon.
   An information is a written accusation of a crime signed by a
prosecutor. The purpose of an information is to inform a defendant
and the court of charges.
   By pleading guilty to an information, Atkinson waived his right
to a grand jury proceeding. He also agreed to cooperate with
investigators.
   The FBI said a portion of the proceeds of the loan Atkinson
received from Vernon went to pay the rent on a beach house in Solana
Beach, Calif., which was used primarily by a senior Vernon official.
   The FBI said Atkinson and Vernon officials knew the real purpose
of the loan, the amount of which was not revealed. Atkinson paid
$577,000 in rent on the house over a three-year period, the agency
said.
   Atkinson faces a maximum four years in jail and $500,000 fine.
   Vernon was shut down by federal regulators in November 1987 and
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. committed $1.3 billion
to reopen the thrift as Monfort Savings Association.
   Late last year, Monfort was consolidated with other thrifts to
form Houston-based First Gibraltar Federal Savings Bank, the state's
largest thrift.
   Since January 1988, five senior Vernon officials have pleaded
guilty to felony charges. Vernon chief operating officer Patrick G.
King and chairman Woody F. Lemons are awaiting trial on indictments
returned in the investigation.

<HEAD>Earnings Rose 17 Percent in Latest Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications giant Gannett Co. Inc. said
Wednesday its second-quarter earnings rose 17 percent partly because
newspaper advertising revenues were up while production costs were
down.
   After-tax profit for the three months ended June 25 was $112.1
million, or 70 cents a share, on operating revenues of $904.1
million. That compared with earnings of $97.5 million, or 60 cents a
share, on operating revenues of $846.9 million for the same quarter
in 1988.
   Operating income advanced 15 percent in the second quarter to
$215.5 million from $188.1 million last year.
   Gannett's chairman and president, John J. Curley, said second
quarter earnings for the Rosslyn, Va.-based newspaper, broadcasting
and outdoor advertising concern were fueled by higher newspaper
operating income.
   ``Newspaper earnings benefitted from higher advertising revenues,
lower newsprint prices and the first-ever second-quarter profit at
USA Today,'' Gannett's national newspaper, Curley said in a letter
to shareholders.
   USA Today's first profitable quarter came in the last quarter of
1987.
   First half profits for 1989 were up 9 percent to $187 million, or
$1.16 per share, compared to $171.4 million, or $1.06 a share, last
year.
   Revenues also were up 7 percent to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion
in the first half of last year.
   Gannett, which operates in 41 states, the District of Columbia
and seven overseas locations, publishes 84 daily newspapers,
operates 10 television and 16 radio stations, Gannett News Services
and the largest outdoor advertising company in North America.

   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, agreed last week to
purchase Coleco's major assets for $85 million cash and an option
for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Pawtucket-based Hasbro at
$28.85 each after its bankruptcy reorganization plan was confirmed,
said Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Conneticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a year ago, citing
debts of $540.3 million.
   Hasbro stock closed at $20 Wednesday on the American Stock
Exchange, down 25 cents a share.
   Hasbro said it had reached agreement with Appalachian Artworks
Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, to begin manufacturing the
dolls immediately, in time to advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including the Scrabble and Parcheesi games
also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   Hasbro, which also bought the right to use Coleco's name, would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985
but slipped to $58 million by last year.

<HEAD>Dunkin' Donuts Challenges Bidders' Financing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dunkin' Donuts Inc. charged Wednesday in a federal
lawsuit that two Canadian companies have made false and misleading
statements about their financing for a $305 million bid to take over
the doughnut chain.
   In an amended complaint in U.S. District Court in Boston, Dunkin'
Donuts alleged that the financing arranged by Unicorp Canada Corp.
and Cara Operations Ltd. would not meet federal margin regulations,
which limit borrowing to buy stock.
   The board of directors of the Randolph-based doughnut chain also
issued a statement contending that the financing for the hostile
tender offer of $43 a share was preliminary and subject to
substantial conditions.
   ``Dunkin' Donuts continues to urge shareholders to reject (the)
highly conditional, illusory and inadequate offer,'' the statement
said.
   A spokesman for the Canadian companies said the allegations by
Dunkin' Donuts were ``totally baseless.''
   The spokesman, Elan Sober, said the companies discussed the offer
with federal regulators in Washington and that the companies ``are
satisfied that it complies fully with all applicable laws, including
the U.S. margin regulations.''
   Unicorp, a Toronto-based real estate, banking and energy firm,
holds about 12 percent of Dunkin' Donuts common stock. It formed a
partnership with Cara, a food services company, to launch the
hostile offer on June 15.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group, a subsidiary of Unicorp, and Cara have
said they would invest up to $80 million of equity and debt in the
takeover and have a firm commitment for an additional $275 million
of financing from Trilon Financial Group and Great Lakes Group Inc.,
both of Toronto.
   ``The commitment letter is a firm, written commitment to lend by
two major Canadian financial institutions,'' said Sober. ``Its
conditions are entirely standard. There is nothing preliminary about
it.''
