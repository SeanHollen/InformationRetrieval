<HEAD>Rights Group Says Sri Lankan and Indian Troops Kill, Torture Rebels</HEAD>

   Sri Lankan and Indian security forces
are responsible for the disappearances of scores of opponents, some
of whom were tortured to death, Amnesty International said.
   Indian and Sri Lankan officials in Colombo declined comment
Tuesday on the report, dated May 1989. In New Delhi, Indian Foreign
Ministry officials said they were waiting to see a copy of the
45-page report before commenting.
   In the report, the London-based human rights organization
expresses concern about arbitrary arrests and detentions without
charge or trial, torture of suspected rebels, deaths in custody and
disappearances of suspects.
   Amnesty issued a similar report a year ago.
   The report says 780 people have disappeared in Sri Lanka since
emergency regulations were imposed in 1983, when militants from the
Tamil minority began fighting for a separate homeland. Eighty-three
of them vanished after India and Sri Lanka signed a 1987 peace
agreement to end the insurgency, it says.
   Amnesty International says both Indian and Sri Lankan security
forces deny knowledge of the arrests of those who disappeared. In
some cases, it says, security forces claim they released missing
suspects.
   ``Several people have died in custody both in the north and the
south, Amnesty International believes as a result of torture,''
says the report.
   Indian soldiers were sent to northern and eastern Sri Lanka in
July 1987 to enforce the peace accord. But the biggest Tamil rebel
group, the Tamil Tigers, reneged and started attacking Indian
troopers.
   The accord prompted a backlash among radicals in the Sinhalese
majority, who began their own violent campaign, primarily in the
south where Sri Lankan forces operate.
   According to Amnesty International, 49 of those who disappeared
in the last two years were Sinhalese militants taken into custody
by Sri Lankan forces in the south. In the same period, Indian
troops in the north arranged the disappearances of 34 people, the
report says.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
militants claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese
majority. More than 12,500 people have died in the fighting, mostly
Sinhalese civilians massacred by rebels.
   This month, the Tamil Tigers agreed to peace talks with the
government.

   An opposition parliamentarian linked to the
influence-peddling scandal that caused the downfall of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned on Tuesday. Authorities summoned
him for questioning on Wednesday.
   Katsuya Ikeda cited personal reasons for his resignation from
Parliament and from the Komeito, or Clean Government Party. The
four-term member of the House of Representatives was the second
opposition lawmaker to step down.
   Ikeda, 51, and Rep. Takao Fujinami, 56, a member of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and a senior aide to former
Prime Minister Yasushiro Nakasone, arrived for questioning early
Wednesday at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office.
   They were the first elected officials to be questioned as
suspects in the scandal, which involves purchases of stock in the
Recruit Co.
   Prosecutors are believed to have chosen questioning and not
arrest due to legal difficulties involving the incarceration of a
lawmaker, particularly when Parliament is in session. The
seriousness of the move is regarded as equivalent to arrest by
Japanese legal custom.
   Meanwhile, Komeito chairman Junya Yano told a news conference he
was stepping down as party head to take responsibility for
Komeito's link to a series of scandals including Recruit.
   Yano was the second opposition party leader to resign because of
Recruit. Saburo Tsukamoto resigned as head of the Democratic
Socialist Party in February after it was revealed he profited from
Recruit share transactions.
   Prosecutors said they suspect Ikeda and Fujinami used their
influence to the advantage of Recruit and received bribes in the
form of bargain-priced unlisted stocks.
   Ikeda has admitted his brother, Yuzuru, bought 5,000 shares in
Recruit and earned about $73,530 in profit. He denied his own link
to the stock transaction, but news reports said $51,470 of the
profit was deposited into Ikeda's bank account.
   Ikeda, who also received $102,940 in donations from Recruit,
resigned from Parliament to take responsibility for ``causing
troubles'' for his Buddhist-affiliated party, the second-largest
opposition group after the Socialists. His resignation must be
approved by the house speaker.
   Fujinami, 56, has acknowledged his secretary, Eiji Tokuda,
bought 12,000 shares in Recruit in October 1986. After a public
listing about a month later, share prices shot up quickly, and
Tokuda netted $191,000 in profit.
   The Liberal Democrat has said the stock deal was Tokuda's
business and denied personal involvement. However, news reports
said Fujinami used the profit to buy a luxury home in Tokyo.
   Fujinami is also known to have received about $661,000 in
political donations from Recruit.
   Fujinami, who was Nakasone's top Cabinet aide between 1984 and
1987, is widely seen as holding a key to the link between Recruit
and Nakasone. Critics say Fujinami's testimony will determine
whether further prosecution is possible for other senior
politicians, including Nakasone.
   On Tuesday, Nakasone reportedly agreed to testify about his role
in the scanda. Opposition parties have stalled parliamentary
business to back demands that he testify.
   Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of the stock deals,
previously said he would testify in Parliament only after
prosecutors completed the Recruit investigation.
   This time, in a meeting with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the governing
party's deputy secretary general, Nakasone did not set any
conditions, the Kyodo News Service said.
   The Recruit information conglomerate, accused of trying to
influence government policy, sold such shares in a subsidiary to
about 160 influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   It also made large political contributions to politicians
including Takeshita, who announced last month he would resign to
take responsibility for the scandal.
   The Liberal Democratic Party still is searching for a candidate
untainted by the scandal to succeed Takeshita.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and Recruit
executives on charges of bribery and securities law violations in
the stock deals. In addition, three members of Takeshita's Cabinet
have resigned because of links with Recruit.
   In November, a member of the Japan Socialist Party, Takumi Ueda,
gave up his seat in Parliament after news reports linked him with
the scandal.

   A woman told a judge her ex-husband
threatened to kill her hours before her slaying and his arrest for
commandeering an airplane and firing an assault rifle into Boston
from the air, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, is accused of shooting his ex-wife,
Elvira, eight times with the assault rifle in front of their
5-year-old son on May 10.
   He then took the plane at gunpoint, and performed aerobatics
over the area while firing randomly into Boston, authorities say.
   Earlier that day, the divorced couple appeared before Salem
Superior Court Judge David T. Doyle for Hunter's trial on charges
of assault and battery, violating a restraining order and making
criminal threats against Mrs. Hunter.
   ``Well, he, he told me that if I don't drop the charges, he'll
kill me,'' Mrs. Hunter, a native of the Philippines, told Doyle in
halting English, according to an audio tape of the trial obtained
by The Beverly Times.
   Hunter denied in court that he had made the threat.
   According to the tape, the couple had been living together for
10 months even though Mrs. Hunter had obtained a court order to
keep her husband away a year earlier.
   The couple gave differing accounts of a Dec. 31 fight that sent
Mrs. Hunter to the hospital with a fractured rib and resulted in
Hunter's trial.
   Mrs. Hunter said she was lying in the living room watching
television when her husband came in and became angry with her
because she didn't leave.
   ``All of a sudden he just punch me and put his knees in my ribs,
pushing me down on the couch,'' she said. ``I couldn't breathe
because he put his knees on me,'' according to the tape.
   Hunter said he was watching a program with his son when his
ex-wife came in to change the channel. He said he reached for the
remote control and his wife, an experienced martial arts student,
tried to kick him. Hunter said he punched her in self-defense.
   Hunter insisted that the bruises shown in a photograph taken of
his wife after the incident were inflicted with an open hand.
   ``If I hit her with my fist it would be worse than that, believe
me,'' he told Doyle.
   Doyle found Hunter guilty on all counts and sentenced him to a
year's probation. The Times quoted courtroom observers as saying
that Hunter called the court a ``kangaroo court,'' and that he
would not submit to probation.
   The probation officer on duty protested, but Hunter was allowed
to leave the courtroom, the newspaper said.
   The next day, Hunter was brought before Doyle to be arraigned
for murder.
   Hunter pleaded innocent to charges of murder and armed robbery,
and was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for 20 days of
psychiatric evaluation. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life
in prison.

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez was on automatic pilot
12 minutes before the tanker crashed into a reef and spilled oil,
the vessel's third mate told federal investigators Tuesday.
   Gregory T. Cousins, who was in command of the 987-foot tanker
when it ran aground on March 24, testified that he took a bearing
and, a few minutes later, tried to change the ship's course back
toward its designated shipping lane.
   Cousins said that when he determined the ship's course had not
changed significantly, he attempted a sharper turn, but the ship
seemed to continue moving toward the charted reef.
   ``It's a source of trouble for me as to why the vessel did not
track away from that track line,'' Cousins told a National
Transportation Safety Board panel as it began a five-day hearing.
   The Exxon Valdez leaked 10.9 million gallons of oil into
wildlife-rich Prince William Sound, polluting hundreds of miles of
shoreline and killing countless birds, fish and marine mammals in
the nation's worst oil spill.
   The panel is trying to determine why the tanker strayed far from
the shipping lane on a clear night, whether Capt. Joseph Hazelwood
was drunk and why Cousins _ who was not certified to operate the
vessel in those waters _ was in command.
   The third mate said Hazelwood left the bridge to send out
messages after ordering the ship out of designated lanes to avoid
floating ice. Cousins testified that Hazelwood did not appear
intoxicated. Hazelwood failed sobriety tests administered about
nine hours after the crash.
   Four other Exxon Shipping Co. employees who testified Tuesday
agreed that Hazelwood did not appear intoxicated that night.
   However, William E. Murphy, an independent pilot who helped
guide the Exxon Valdez through part of the sound, said he smelled
alcohol on Hazelwood's breath. Murphy added that the captain did
not act intoxiciated.
   Cousins said he could not explain why the vessel was on
automatic pilot. Exxon policy limits use of the device to open
waters.
   Cousins said that after trying to return the ship to a traffic
lane, he called Hazelwood and told him ``it looked like we might
get into the leading edge of the ice.''
   Under questioning by Coast Guard Commander Darryle Waldron of
Juneau, Cousins said there was never any discussion about reducing
the ship's speed. Operating at a slower speed would have made the
ship harder to move through the sound, Cousins said. The Exxon
Valdez was traveling between half and full speed at the time of the
accident.
   The panel will question more than two dozen witnesses, including
Coast Guard personnel and Exxon executives, and try to determine
whether the Coast Guard, the oil industry and the state reacted as
promptly as possible to the spill.
   Cousins said that just before the collision he told Hazelwood,
``I think we're in serious trouble.'' Then the Exxon Valdez hit the
reef. Cousins said it felt like ``a slight roll _ a very unusual
sensation. I knew we hit something.''
   ``Several seconds passed and we experienced a series of jolts to
the vessel. By the time we came to a full stop, I'd estimate we
felt a series of six jolts,'' Cousins recalled.
   ``There seemed to be a hesitation, and I spun the wheel hard
left. By that time I believe we were hard aground.''
   Cousins said he shined a light on the water but could not see
oil because it was too dark. But he said he could smell oil.
   Hazelwood came on the bridge, ordered crew members to assess the
damage, then tried to rock the Exxon Valdez free without success,
Cousins said. Hazelwood informed the Coast Guard of the grounding
within 10 to 15 minutes, Cousins said.
   Cousins, who was questioned by lead investigator William Woody,
answered questions about his work history, educational background
and technical subjects. The third mate was accompanied by a lawyer.
   Hazelwood will not testify in order to protect his rights in his
upcoming criminal trial.
   The panel of inquiry includes representatives from the state,
Exxon, the Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a
consortium of oil companies that runs the 800-mile Alaskan pipeline.
   The public hearings were scheduled to run through Saturday in a
hotel ballroom.
   The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to
a year to complete, said NTSB spokeswoman Drucella Andersen.
   The fired captain, who is free on $50,000 bail, has been charged
with operating a vessel while drunk and goes on trial June 20. He
faces two years, three months in jail and $11,000 in fines if
convicted.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path guerrillas killed 16 people
in attacks on three nearby villages Tuesday on the eve of the
Maoist movement's ninth anniversary, officials reported.
   Police said about 40 guerrillas with rifles, revolvers and
explosives burst into the hamlet of Vinchos, about five miles west
of Ayacucho, early Tuesday.
   Survivors of the attack told police that the guerrillas gathered
the townspeople together and accused 14 of them of belonging to a
``peasant patrol'' before shooting them to death.
   The government-supported patrols are organized in isolated
regions to help peasants protect themselves from the Shining Path.
   Following the killings, the guerrillas raided several homes,
taking with them clothes, kerosene lamps and food, police reported.
They then burned the homes, police said.
   In another incident, guerrillas in the town of Huanta, 30 miles
north of Ayacucho, killed an 18-year-old man and left behind a sign
reading ``This is how the traitors and snitches die,'' police said.
   Officials said the man likely had collaborated with authorities
in the past.
   In a third attack on Tuesday, a peasant patrol leader in the
village of Runguyo, just south of Ayacucho, was slain by
guerrillas, police said.
   The Shining Path began near the Andean city of Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima. It began attacks on May 17, 1980 in the
town of Chuschi, about 30 miles southeast of Ayacucho.
   More than 14,000 people, including guerrillas, peasants,
political authorities, police and soldiers, have been killed in the
insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis is finally
back at its launch site after a weather-interrupted 2{-day odyssey
across the South atop a NASA Boeing 747 jetliner.
   The jumbo jet landed here shortly before dark Monday evening
after making two unscheduled stops in Texas and one in Georgia on a
trip from California that normally takes only a few hours.
   Atlantis and its five astronauts landed at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., on May 8 at the end of a four-day space mission that
dispatched the Magellan spacecraft on a 15-month journey to Venus
to map the planet.
   Bolted atop the 747, the space shuttle left Edwards on Saturday.
But storms over central Texas forced the 747 to stop at Biggs Army
Air Field near El Paso. It sat on the ground there Saturday and
Sunday nights, waiting for the weather to clear.
   The jet took off Monday morning and landed at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, waiting for a few hours while forecasters
assessed the weather between Texas and Florida.
   With a threat of thunderstorms in central Florida, NASA decided
to fly the 747 into Warner Robbins Air Force Base near Macon, Ga.,
and again look at the weather.
   Officials had just about decided to stay overnight in Georgia
and complete the trip today when the Florida clouds started to
clear.
   NASA sent a T-38 jet out to survey the flight path, and when the
pilot gave the all-clear, the 747 took off on the final hour-long
flight leg.
   The darkening sky was clear here when the big jet and its $1.2
billion shuttle passenger landed at 8:09 p.m. on a 15,000-foot
runway just three miles from the launch pad where Atlantis blasted
into space on May 4.
   The delayed trip could make the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration think about hastening the day when shuttles will end
their space trips on the runway here. All landings have been in
California since a shuttle blew a tire here in April 1985.
Officials have said they will continue to return orbiting shuttles
to wide-open and safer Edwards until new brake and steering systems
have been throughly tested.
   Atlantis now will be readied for another planetary mission, to
propel the Galileo spacecraft toward Jupiter in October.

<TEXT>
   European unity, a subject that traditionally
leaves the British cold, is suddenly a hot issue.
   The reason is a sustained attack by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on the unity concept, and a ferocious counterblast from
her predecessor, Edward Heath.
   The long-term source of the discord is 1992, when the 12 nations
of the European Economic Community are to drop their tariff
barriers and become a single trading bloc with complete freedom of
movement for people and goods.
   But where Britain tends to see 1992 as an economic advance and
little more, most continental Europeans see it as a major step
toward political unity.
   Of more immediate import is next month's European Parliament
election. Usually the British voter turnout, at under 32 percent,
is by far the lowest in the EEC. But the Heath-Thatcher conflict
has injected excitement into this year's election, because it
signals a split in the Tory party as it vies for Britain's 81 seats
in the 518-seat Parliament.
   The Times of London called it an ``astonishing public outbreak
of internal discord.''
   For months, Mrs. Thatcher has been attacking the EEC's vision of
unity, saying it means a ``superstate'' of faceless bureaucrats in
Brussels, throwing all sorts of socialist-tinged obstacles in the
path of her free-market revolution.
   This in turn leads many continentals to call the British
``reluctant Europeans'' _ an island race more loyal to the United
States than Europe, a nation of shopkeepers who are only in the EEC
for the money.
   Mrs. Thatcher first raised the ``superstate'' specter at a
speech in September, and she returned to the theme Friday in a
speech to her Conservative Party, saying she wanted ``our kind of
Europe; not a socialist superstate in Brussels which submerges our
identity and snuffs out our sovereignty, but a free Europe.''
   This was too much for Heath, who took Britain into the EEC in
1973 and has since been its ardent defender.
   In a BBC-TV interview Sunday, Heath called Mrs. Thatcher's views
``absolute nonsense,'' misleading and aimed at turning the public
against the EEC.
   He derided Mrs. Thatcher's claim that the EEC was top-heavy with
bureaucrats, saying it had 9,200 employees administering 320
million people, compared with 11,800 civil servants in Scotland
governing 5.5 million people.
   He said there was no reason to fear a socialist EEC when so many
EEC governments were non-socialist, and reminded Mrs. Thatcher that
she had signed the Single European Act, which makes 1992 possible
and broadly lays out the European future she is now so determined
to resist.
   Mrs. Thatcher worries the EEC wants to go beyond pure trading
issues and set social standards, like a pan-European minimum wage,
worker participation in industrial management and harmonized
welfare systems.
   She calls this ``socialism through the back door'' at a time
when she is cutting back trade union power and trying to trim
welfare spending.
   She also is hostile to EEC proposals for monetary union and a
European central bank, fearing it will undermine her freedom to
make economic policy.
   Some critics say Heath's attacks on Mrs. Thatcher stem from his
resentment toward her for unseating him as Conservative Party
leader in 1975.
   Tory lawmaker John Carlisle said Heath, 72, ``should be put out
to grass and not bother the nation any more.''
   But other Tories worry that Mrs. Thatcher's combative stance
will alienate the EEC. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine
fears if Britain stands aloof, France and West Germany will
dominate the bloc. ``Every hostile speech breeds at best despair,
at worst contempt,'' he wrote in a book published Tuesday.
   On Monday, Mrs. Thatcher made no direct comment on Heath, but
managed a subtle dig at the continentals by reminding them that
they owed their liberation from Nazi tyranny to Britain and the
United States.
   Europe, she said, ``would not have been liberated unless we
stood and unless America joined us.'' Britain had fought to free
Europe of Nazism, she said, and now it was fighting to keep it free
of ``a bureaucracy of standardization and harmonization.''

   Their basketball team was trounced in
nearly every outing, and the school's first-ever rock groups were
dubbed the Gentlemen Callers and the Outnumbered.
   The first men to break the gender barrier at Wheaton College _
that's 82 men on a campus of 1,150 students _ say it's been a
turbulent year, but they'll be back.
   ``It was awkward at first walking into a class of, say, 40
women. You feel like a minority, but by the end of the semester
everyone was talking openly,'' said Jonathan Hart, a Greenwich,
Conn., first-year student and member of the Outnumbered.
   ``It was really a great experience to hear an opposite view that
sort of has been hidden traditionally by society,'' said Hart.
   ``This school has gone beyond what I expected,'' said first-year
student Mark Sweet.
   Hart and Sweet said the male-female ratio didn't translate into
the dating frenzy imagined by some of their high school friends.
   ``The first thing anybody says is, `Oh, wow, I hear the ratio is
20-to-1,''' Hart said. Although he is dating a Wheaton woman, Hart
said he and his male friends didn't pay the $17,000-plus annual
tuition for a better social life.
   The school's January 1987 decision to break with a 154-year
tradition and admit men outraged some alumnae and seniors who felt
the school was abandoning its commitment to women's education. In a
settlement, Wheaton returned $127,000 to 56 donors who wanted their
money back.
   Still, said Sue Alexander, dean of students, the overall
response was encouraging. While enrollment at other women's
colleges is slipping, applications rose 54 percent and annual
giving climbed 18 percent.
   About 400 men have applied for next year's freshman class.
   Senior Maura Whelan, who had reservations about the change, said
she now is pleased. ``I think Wheaton is now committed not to
tradition in the traditional sense, but to collaboration,'' she
said.
   ``I think they've just given a new perspective and they've added
a lot of excitement to the campus,'' said first-year student Paula
Rea of Danbury, Conn.
   Few physical changes were needed at the picturesque, rural
campus, Alexander said.
   ``We did have to get longer beds,'' she said. ``We had two rock
bands that emerged in the first semester and we never before had
quite such stresses placed on our quiet space in dormitories.''
   And the men tended to spend more time outdoors, playing Frisbee
or tossing footballs, she said.
   Wheaton prides itself on academics rather than athletics, and
the 3-7 showing of the men's basketball team, playing against
bigger and older men at co-ed schools, didn't seem to make any
difference, Alexander said.
   But she recalled one game at which Wheaton women turned out in
force, deafening the opposition with their cheers.
   Another problem was news media attention to the transition,
students said.
   ``They always seemed to catch women gawking at men,'' said
junior Heather Van Holland of Weston.
   Hart and Sweet said they intend to graduate from Wheaton and
know of few men who won't be returning. ``Here, I can hear both
sides of the story,'' Hart said.

   A day-long protest by Stanford
University students demanding action against campus racism ended
with the arrest of 55 students Monday, many of whom had barricaded
themselves inside the president's office.
   The students were cited for misdemeanors that included unlawful
asssembly, trespassing and failure to disperse, said university
spokeswoman Eileen Walsh.
   About 60 students who took part in the protest occupied or
barricaded the office of university president Donald Kennedy at
about 7:30 a.m. After negotiations between the students and
university officials failed, Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies
began arresting protesters shortly before 4 p.m.
   Participants, who were trying to call attention to their demands
for more minority faculty members, ethnic centers and other efforts
combating racism on campus, called a noon rally for Tuesday.
   Twelve of those arrested were taken by deputies to the county
jail in San Jose, where they were booked for investigation of
misdemeanor charges, Walsh said.
   Another 40 were cited and released after a crowd of several
hundred cheering supporters prevented the sheriff's bus full of
arrestees from leaving by creating a blockade of bodies, cars and
bicycles, Walsh said.
   Three other participants were cited for resisting and delaying
an officer, Walsh said. They were released.
   The occupation of Kennedy's office began about 7:30 a.m. when
the students pushed past a receptionist. The students asked other
employees to leave, then blocked the doors.
   The protest involved Asian-American, black, American Indian and
Hispanic groups, which sought a meeting with Kennedy to discuss
their demands.
   Kennedy, who has promised to respond to a report by the
University Committee on Minority Issues at a meeting Thursday, went
directly from home to teach a 9 a.m. biology class. Later, he said
in a statement that the committee report ``must be dealt with in a
thoughtful and orderly fashion.''
   ``Preemptive and unlawful actions like those taken this morning
represent no substitute and should instead be treated for what they
are,'' he said. ``As is our practice, the university will not
negotiate on issues of substance in response to unlawful coercion.''
   At Michigan State University in East Lansing, meanwhile, a black
sit-in at the administration building turned a week old with no
sign of weakening.
   The protesters are demanding more black faculty, punishment for
racist acts on campus, more recruitment of black students, creation
of a minority adviser to the provost, and the hiring of more
minorities for university jobs.

<HEAD>Israeli Peace Plan Poses Major Obstacles for Arab Acceptance</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's 20-point peace plan contains huge
stumbling blocks to Arab acceptance, ranging from its omission of
Syria to relying on Jordan as the key to an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   The plan, approved Sunday by a 20-6 vote of the Israeli Cabinet,
centers on elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where the Palestinians have been engaged in a bloody uprising for
17 months.
   But it offers only half a loaf to the 1.7 million Palestinians
living in the territories: Limited self-rule, not the independent
state they and the Arabs demand.
   The plan also rules out talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and treats the proposed elections as a way of
bypassing the PLO and the estimated 3 million Palestinians living
outside the occupied lands.
   Many Arabs have expressed interest in the proposed elections,
but most Palestinians insist an Israeli withdrawal must precede any
balloting.
   Perhaps one of the biggest problem the Israelis face in gaining
Arab acceptance is the omission of any reference to Syria _
repeating the fatal flaw of America's 1982 plan to resolve the
civil war in Lebanon.
   There is an Arab saying, ``You can't make war without Egypt or
peace without Syria.''
   Syria has a strong military force on Israel's border and
extensive influence among radical Palestinian groups. It would
never tolerate any plan that fails to address Israel's occupation
of the Golan Heights.
   The Israelis captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 war
when they also overran the West Bank and Gaza Strip and seized Arab
east Jerusalem.
   Syria's influence among hardline Palestinians will grow if the
Israeli plan gains momentum, increasing its opportunities to fuel
unrest among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and to punish
any Arabs who seem ready to accept the Israeli offering.
   The plan also ignores Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees there.
   Most Arab leaders see Israel's occupation of a border strip in
south Lebanon as a major factor in that country's civil war. Many
believe Israel intends to annex the occupied strip in order to
seize water resources there.
   A plan that fails to address that issue bodes continued conflict
between Israeli and Syrian proxies in Lebanon and a de facto
partition of the country _ something few, if any, Arab states would
accept.
   By calling for a peace treaty with Jordan, the plan violates the
Arab gospel that no Arab state can make a separate settlement with
Israel that ignores the rights of other Arab parties _ a rule that
has helped keep Jordan from making peace with Israel for decades.
   Jordan seems less inclined than ever to take such a step.
   The Palestinian uprising led King Hussein to renounce
sovereignty over the West Bank last year in favor of the PLO, with
which he has since closely cooperated.
   Rioting over economic difficulties that swept Jordan last month
have turned the country's concerns inward. An unpopular settlement
with Israel would aggravate Hussein's problems by arousing the
Palestinian half of his population.
   The plan's reference to an ``additional Palestinian state'' in
the occupied lands hints at the hardline Israeli position that a
Palestinian state already exists in Jordan _ a stand that chills
the blood of Jordanian officials and their bedrock Bedouin
supporters.
   The PLO, which has won worldwide support as the voice of
Palestinians, would accept elections only if Israel were to
guarantee it a role in governing the occupied lands.
   The Israeli plan expresses opposition to any Palestinian state,
although it says ``all the proposed options'' for the territories
can be discussed after a 3-year period of self-rule.
   There is also no guarantee of full Israeli withdrawal from the
territories and no word on the status of Jerusalem.
   Arabs see Jerusalem as the most crucial piece of occupied
territory and the PLO has declared that the holy city will be the
capital of the independent state it has proclaimed in an area
roughly encompassing the occupied lands.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan also fails to address U.S.
and Arab calls for international supervision of the elections and
the participation of the 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem.
   For Palestinians outside the occupied lands, the plan appears to
offer them nothing more than permanent refugee status and no say in
any peace talks.
   Their opposition would make it extremely difficult for Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, all of which host sizable
Palestinian populations, to accept the Israeli plan.
   It would also create a large pool of desperate people witnessing
the loss of their dream of returning home: fertile territory for
recruitment of terrorists.

   A temperamental Roseanne Barr reportedly
threatened to quit her hit series ``Roseanne'' during taping of
early episodes and battled the executive producer, who has since
left.
   ``She would come to me and say, `I can't go on. I can't do it. I
have to quit,''' Drew Ogier, the ABC sitcom's prop master, said in
this week's TV Guide. ``And I'd say, `Just do this show.' We'd all
have to help her out.''
   According to the Radnor-based magazine, executive producer Matt
Williams left the show after Barr said either he or she had to
leave. Ellen Falcon, the show's director, also left the series in
mid-season.
   The magazine quoted unidentified insiders with the show as
saying Barr and Williams disagreed strongly over her character's
development.
   Once, Barr objected to a line her character was supposed to say
to her husband, Dan, played by John Goodman. But Williams resisted
any script change.
   ``She felt he did not take her seriously,'' said Ogier, ``She
left the set. It would happen over and over again. Sometimes she'd
leave the set; sometimes she'd grin and bear it.''
   Spokesmen for Barr, Williams and Falcon all declined requests
for interviews, TV Guide said.

   Former Gov. George C. Wallace, bedridden
and unable to hear or see well, promised a return to better health
on the 17th anniversary of the assassination attempt that shattered
his presidential dreams.
   ``I can't be as active as I've been,'' said the 69-year-old
Wallace, who was left paralyzed in the legs after being shot by
Arthur Bremer while campaigning in Laurel, Md., on May 15, 1972.
   In an interview with The Alabama Journal published Monday,
Wallace said complications in his left hip forced him to curtail
his activities. The newspaper gave no details on the ailment.
   ``It's hard to tell what I would have been or done if I had not
been shot,'' said Wallace. ``I would not have had to endure all
this pain, but I don't let that hinder me. I don't think much about
it except having no ill feeling toward Arthur Bremer. I hardly ever
think about him.''
   The Journal said Wallace, dressed in a hospital gown, spoke with
a strong voice during the interview Friday at his Montgomery home.
But the newspaper said it was evident he could not hear questions,
which were asked by a reporter and then written down by one of
Wallace's guards in large letters.
   Wallace said he hopes to resume duties this week for Troy State
University, which he serves out of a Montgomery office. He said he
has been signing letters seeking contributions for the school.
   ``I'll be out of here in a couple of days,'' he said.

   A Mother's Day concert by country star
Willie Nelson was a boon for boaters but a bust for the promoter.
   Promoter Jerry McElveen said he lost $15,000 on the show at
Augusta's riverfront, which attracted fewer than 3,000 paid
ticketholders.
   He claimed at least 1,000 people listened to the show for free
from boats anchored in the river and 100 or more others heard it
from a restaurant balcony. He also said a lot of money was tied up
in tickets sold at outlets that were closed Sunday.
   There were some tense moments before Nelson went on stage when
his road manager learned McElveen might not have enough cash to pay
the star, the promoter said. Nelson went on with the show once
arrangements were made to pay his fee, manager Darrell English said
Monday.
   Tony Conway, Nelson's booking agent in Nashville, Tenn., said
Nelson's contract probably cost about $40,000 to $45,000.
   McElveen said he wouldn't attempt to bring another big-name act
to the riverside venue.
   Dayton Sherrouse, executive director of the Augusta Port
Authority, said there was no easy way to prevent people from seeing
concerts from their boats. ``It's a public river and a navigable
waterway,'' he said.

   Bob Dylan will start a national tour by

   ``I've been working ... to get Dylan for years,'' promoter Jay
Goldberg said Monday. ``This year, the timing was right, and he was
looking to open the tour in the Midwest and at a place that was
private and quiet and could still technically handle his show
needs.''
   Goldberg said $20 tickets for the July 1 show at the 9,000-seat
Civic Center Arena would go on sale Saturday. He predicted a quick
sellout in the town famed for the show-business phrase, ``Will it
play in Peoria?''
   ``His finally playing here shows that Peoria will support

   Margo Adams' lawyer said he will subpoena
five teammates of Wade Boggs to testify in Adams' lawsuit against
the Boston Red Sox third baseman.
   Attorney James McGee said Monday the subpoenas order Jim Rice,
Marty Barrett, Rich Gedman, Dennis ``Oil Can'' Boyd and Dwight
Evans to testify in Boston June 12-15. They will be asked ``to
check the accuracy and truthfulness of what (Boggs and Adams) have
given on their depositions,'' he said.
   Adams claims that Boggs, her former lover, promised to support
her when she quit her job to travel on the road with him during
four seasons. In a deposition Monday to Boggs' attorney, she
claimed her damages are ``in excess of a half-million dollars and
are continuing,'' McGee said.
   Boggs was to continue his deposition today in McGee's Irvine

<TEXT>
   Mexico announced a sweeping liberalization of
its rules on foreign investment Monday in hopes of attracting badly
needed capital to its debt-crippled economy.
   The new rules will open areas previously closed to outsiders and
raise the amount of foreign ownership permitted in others. In some
key areas, such as tourism, Mexico will for the first time allow
100 percent foreign ownership.
   Under Mexico's 1973 Foreign Investment Law, foreign ownership
has been limited to 49 percent in most industries.
   The announcement came as negotiations on restructing the $107.4
billion foreign debt were to resume in New York. Mexico's pledge to
modernize its protectionist economy are a crucial feature of the
debt talks.
   ``No country can modernize without attracting fresh
investment,'' Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche told a news
conference. ``The tendency in the world is moving toward
interdependence.''
   The new regulations, which take effect immediately, open up
previously closed areas such as telecommunications, auto parts,
fishing and secondary petrochemicals to 49 percent foreign
ownership.
   In tourism, a critical item on President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's economic development agenda, the 49 percent limit is
being abolished. Outsiders will now be allowed 100 percent
ownership.
   The new rules will double to 60 years foreign leases on
oceanfront property, Serra Puche said. Foreign ownership of coastal
real estate is prohibited by the Mexican constitution.
   Serra Puche declared it ``historic'' that investors will now be
able to remit 100 percent of profits.
   Many areas deemed strategic such as banking, petroleum, mineral
exploration, electrical generation and broadcasting will remain
off-limits to foreigners, Puche said.
   Mexicans are sensitive to even the suggestion of foreign
ownership in the nation's principal industries, such as petroleum.
Primary petrochemical production will remain off-limits, while
secondary production of by-products such as polyester and nylon
will open to foreign participation.
   Serra Puche said the liberalization is aimed at generating
employment and modernizing the Mexican economy. He also said the
government plans to simplifying paperwork for investors.
   ``The new law eliminates discretionary decisions with clear
regulations as to the criteria for accepting new foreign
investment,'' he said. ``It will bring a high degree of automatic
acceptance in the decisions about foreign investment.''
   The new rules will consolidate regulations pertaining to the
border maquiladora industry, Serra Puche said, but not change them.
   Under the maquiladora program, foreign-made parts are imported
duty-free to Mexico for final assembly. When the finished product
is exported to the United States for sale, the United States taxes
only the labor or the value added in Mexico.
   Serra Puche said the new regulations will steer foreign
investment away from the overcrowded, polluted industrial areas of
Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara.
   The Mexican economy has been battered by the debt and low oil
prices to the point of near zero-growth. Mexican officials say
foreign capital is essential to stimulating growth.
   The Commerce Department said that foreign investment totalled
$3.1 billion last year.
   The new investment regulations follow other economic reforms
such as a wage and price control program that cut inflation from a
record 159 percent in 1987 to 51.7 percent last year, joining the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, stimulation of
non-petroleum exports and the privatization or closure of some
state-owned business and industries.

   Chinese and Soviet reformers led the movement in their countries
that brought about the momentous declaration Tuesday that the big
communist powers agreed to normalize relations.
   They had been feuding for 30 years over border and ideological
disputes, but the mistrust was rooted in centuries.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and China's senior leader,
Deng Xiaoping, used their Beijing summit to declare a new beginning.
   Strained relations deteriorated further following the Beijing
summit in 1959 when Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung both took
hard lines.
   Years later Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs: ``You might say
that China is both close to us and far from us. It's close in that
it's our next-door neighbor and shares a long border with our
country. At the same time, China is far away in that the Chinese
have little in common with our people.''
   When the Chinese Communists defeated the Nationalists in 1949
there was apprehension in the West that China, the world's most
populous nation, would unite with the Soviet Union, the strongest
Communist power, and threaten the free world.
   But the romance was brief. In 1972 the United States and China
began normalizing relations, leaving the Soviets in a backwash of
hostility.
   Chinese-Soviet mistrust dates to at least the 13th century when
Mongol forces invaded Russia, destroying towns, slaughtering most
residents and enslaving the suravivors.
   Soviet children still are taught of the brutality and of the
victory of Ivan the Great who ``threw off the Mongol yoke'' and
established the Russian state in 1480.
   More recently suspicion was planted in the infancy of the
international Communist movement.
   In 1927, a decade after the Bolshevik revolution, Chiang
Kai-shek began a purge of Chinese Communists with whom he
ostensibly had been allied.
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin remained silent, apparently
unwilling to alienate Chiang, and during World War II the Soviets
aided Chiang's Nationalists fighting Japan.
   But when Chiang and his Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949, the
Soviet Union was first to recognize China's new Communist
government.
   Mao traveled to Moscow but spent much of the 10 weeks he was
there impatiently waiting to see Stalin. They signed a 30-year
Treaty of Friendship.
   The Soviets wanted access to Chinese resources but Mao resisted,
mindful of the unequal treaties and trade concessions extracted by
the English, Portuguese and others.
   In 1954, Khrushchev invited China to send a million laborers to
Siberia to help exploit the esources, but when Mao accepted the
Soviets became convinced he was trying to take over the Siberian
economy and absorb the vast, sparsely populated territory.
   ``In short, they wanted to make Siberia Chinese rather than
Russian,'' Khrushchev wrote. ``It was a clever maneuver, but it
didn't work.''
   The Kremlin quickly ended the labor program.
   Relations were further exacerbated by Khrushchev's denunciation
of Stalin, who died in 1953, at a Soviet Party Congress in 1956.
   Mao initially joined in criticizing Stalin, but then reversed
his stand and began praising him, according to Khrhshchev.
   ``I think that secretly, he (Mao) disapproved all along of our
censuring Stalin for his crimes,'' Khrushchev wrote. ``Why do I
think so? Because I believe Mao suffered from the same megalomania
Stalin had all his life. He had the same diseased outlook on other
people.''
   Mistrust turned to animosity when the Soviets reneged on an
agreement to provide China with nuclear-weapons technology.
Khrushchev claimed Mao was eager to use the bomb on his enemies.
   Despite the icy relations Khrushchev made a secret trip to
Beijing in hopes of persuading Mao to let the Soviet navy build a
communications base and refueling facilities on Chinese territory.
Mao resisted.
   At the last summit in September 1959 in Beijing, ``the warmth
had gone out of our relations with China and it had been replaced
by a chill that I could sense as soon as I arrived,'' Khrushchev
recalled.
   Soviet advisers and engineers assigned to projects in China
became the target of anti-Soviet feelings and in the summer of 1960
the Kremlin withdrew all technical personnel, leaving hundreds of
projects unfinished.
   Mao's rejection of what he considered Soviet revisionism brought
China's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution intended to purify Chinese
communism. That widened the gulf and Soviet and Chinese troops
fought several border skirmishes in 1969.
   As recently as 1979, the year the United States and China
restored relations, there was talk of war long the frontier.
   Soviet author Victor Louis predicted China's ethnic minorities
would rise up and seek unity with their cousins in pro-Soviet
Mongolia and Soviet Central Asia.
   Louis, widely believed to have ties to the KGB secret police,
said fighting could start at any moment and hundreds of thousands
of Soviet ``volunteers'' would rush to aid the oppressed minorities.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against MacDonald in Landmark Tribal Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navajo tribal judge ruled Monday
that the Tribal Council acted within its authority in placing
Chairman Peter MacDonald and Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson on
administrative leave.
   The action was unprecedented in Navajo law: The 200,000-member
tribe, which has operated since the 1920s under a Tribal Code but
without a written constitution, never had tried to oust its chief
executive.
   The long-awaited, 50-page ruling by District Judge Robert Yazzie
enjoins MacDonald and Thompson from ``attempting to assert official
authority which has been declared withdrawn.''
   The council's 49-13 vote against MacDonald on Feb. 17 stemmed
from U.S. Senate subcommittee testimony linking MacDonald to
kickbacks from contractors and personal profit from a $33.4 million
tribal land purchase.
   MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing. He has not been charged,
although a federal grand jury in Phoenix is looking into
allegations raised in the hearings.
   The council placed Thompson on leave March 10.
   MacDonald attorney Thomas J. Hynes of Farmington, N.M., declined
to comment on the ruling and said he wasn't sure if there would be
an appeal to the tribe's Supreme Court.
   ``That would be up to the chairman,'' he said.
   Neither MacDonald nor Thompson could not be reached for comment
Monday.

   Sometimes it takes a little nipper to catch
a big fish.
   Armed with her telescoping Fisher-Price rod clamped to her
little tackle box, 28-inch-long Katie Miller nabbed a 27-inch
walleye.
   OK, she had plenty of help from her dad, Richard W. Miller. But
the fact is that little rod, the one with the black plastic reel,
hauled in this big 7-pound walleye to give 20-month-old Katie a
successful Fishing Opener Weekend.
   Katie's mom, Anita, says the family was fishing Sunday night on
the dock of their Island Lake home. Katie held the rod after her
father cast into the water.
   ``My husband saw her line going out, and he said, `Oh, she's got
a fish!''' Mrs. Miller recalled.
   ``We got it in by the dock, and there was this great big swirl
in the water. My husband said, `Get the net!' Of course, we didn't
have a net there. So, he got it under the gills and pulled it in.
I'd never seen a fish that big.''
   Katie, who had become a spectator for most of this operation,
evidently was pleased with her fish.
   ``She liked it,'' her mother said. ``She touched it.''
   Katie's father had promised all along that he would have her
first fish mounted. He was planning on something a little smaller.
   ``It's going to cost us $141 to mount this fish!'' Mrs. Miller
said.

   File this in the only in New York category.
   Where can diners walk through the bar into the kitchen, down a
steep flight of steps to the basement and through a narrow hallway
to a small room for the privilege of paying a minimum of $350 per
person for dinner?
   At the 21 Club.
   The club's famed secret wine cellar, where Prohibition guests
downed drinks behind the protection of a 4,000-pound secret door,
opened Monday night as a sanctuary for well-heeled diners.
   Inside, a single table set with sparkling silver and a floral
centerpiece sat amid floor-to-ceiling racks of wine bottles and a
wooden booth where high-living Mayor Jimmy Walker used to knock
back a few in the 1920s.
   But intimacy, nostalgia and a six-course supper don't come cheap
in the midtown Manhattan restaurant's one-table sanctum that can
accommodate up to 12 gourmets.
   ``Prices start for dinner at $350 a head, and that includes a
selection of wines we would recommend,'' said Ken Aretsky, chairman
of the 21 Club.
   Fifty-five years ago, the recess was hidden by pipes and hams,
Aretsky said.
   A tap on the wall indicates nothing unusual. But when chief
sommelier Matt Siegel sticks a long, slender steel rod into a tiny
hole _ Voila! _ the secret 4,000-pound brick door opens.
   During Prohibition, federal agents once searched 10 hours for
the secret door, Siegel said.
   ``They knocked on the walls and lit matches to find a draft,''
but never found it, he said proudly.

   The Bush administration is mixing praise for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to revamp Soviet economics and
politics with skepticism about the Soviet leader's proposals to
reduce nuclear weapons in Europe.
   ``What is going on in the Soviet Union is truly revolutionary
when you consider the economic and political system they have had
for the last 70 years,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday.
   Just back from Moscow and a 3{-hour meeting with Gorbachev, the
U.S. official said he favored normal trade with the Soviet Union,
which is now restricted by the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, and
gave a positive appraisal of perestroika, the economic
restructuring Gorbachev outlined at length in their meeting.
   ``It's light years away from where they were a few years ago,''
Baker said. ``It's important to recognize that what is going on is
real.''
   Talking to a group of constituents of Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., he said the Soviets are unilaterally reducing their
military forces, as urged by the United States.
   ``They're saying that their economic and political system has
failed,'' Baker said. ``They're having elections. They're trying to
open up politically and economically. Clearly they are coming in
our direction and we ought to welcome that.''
   In fact, Baker told the Connecticut group, ``They are singing
out of our own hymn book.''
   But he also said the United States should not let its guard
down, and he described Gorbachev's decision to withdraw 500
short-range nuclear missiles, bombs and artillery shells from
Eastern Europe as ``a very small step.''
   At the same time, a State Department spokesman denounced a
statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that
the Soviets might retain 200 nuclear missiles banned in a 1987
treaty with the United States if NATO proceeds with a program to
upgrade its short-range missiles.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said, ``We think Shevardnadze's
remarks are an outlandish statement. One day the Soviets announce
small unilateral reductions; the next day they are talking about
breaking a recently concluded treaty.''
   Shevardnadze, on a visit to Bonn, West Germany, last Saturday,
said the Soviets might retain their SS-23s, which have a range of
310 miles, just within the range of banned missiles, or develop a
new short-range nuclear missile if NATO more than triples the range
of its Lance missiles.
   The program, which West Germany and several other NATO allies
are trying to delay, would extend the range of the Lance to about
250 miles. There are 88 Lance launchers, most of them in West
Germany, with about 700 single-warhead missiles.
   Boucher said the SS-23s undoubtedly were covered by the 1987 INF
treaty and short-range missiles were not covered. He said ``a look
at the text'' would confirm the U.S. position.
   ``We find it especially ironic that the Soviets threaten to
break the INF treaty in an effort to pressure the West on
short-range systems which they have just finished modernizing and
where they hold at least a 12-1 advantage over the West,'' the
spokesman said.

<HEAD>IHS Allegedy Misusing Indian Health Money</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Hearing resumes at 10 a.m. EDT. Top prospects uncertain.</HEAD>

   The Indian Health Service is allegedly taking
money intended to help Indians fight alcohol abuse and using it for
staff conferences, a Senate panel has been told.
   The incident is one among many in an agency that is understaffed
and poorly managed, witnesses told the special subcommittee looking
at the way federal agencies and private businesses deal with
Indians.
   Larry Morey, deputy inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, told the panel Monday his office is
investigating the IHS handling of $70,000 that was earmarked for
alcohol abuse programs.
   Instead, Morey testified, the money was spent to send top
officials of the IHS office in Albuquerque, N.M., to a ``retreat.''
   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said panel
investigators discovered the group went to a resort near Santa Fe,
N.M., and engaged in activities such as massage therapy.
   Dr. Everett Rhoades, IHS director, later defended the use of the
money, telling reporters the event was a staff training program.
   In order for the staff to help Indians change their behavior
toward alcohol, they had to change how they regard themselves, he
said
   ``We have to be a proponent of wellness,'' he said. It is
``crucial to train them (the staff) how to be leaders to modify
community behavior.''
   Dr. Bruce Nicholson, former clinical director for IHS in Pine
Ridge, S.D., accused the IHS of misusing funds.
   ``In my experience, they were spending money on conferences and
air travel when we were desperately asking for more nurse midwives
and ob-gyn services to combat infant mortality rates of 30 to 40
percent per 1,000 live births,'' he said.
   He called IHS ``bureaucracy that has gotten out of control.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, said IHS officials won't be questioned
until the special investigating subcommittee has had time to study
documents that were finally provided by the IHS.
   The agency sent the documents to the panel Friday, DeConcini
said, even though the papers had been requested March 2.
   ``It was not until Friday evening, May 12, at 6:20 p.m., less
than 72 hours before this hearing, that the agency provided us with
any of the documents we requested,'' DeConcini said.
   He said that did not give the committee time to prepare
questions.
   ``We will not allow IHS to alter or compromise the quality and
integrity of our investigative practices,'' DeConcini said.
   Rhoades agreed that the IHS should have been more forthcoming,
but said the amount of work involved in meeting the committee's
requests was ``astronomical.''
   He said the committee's March 2 letter requesting documentation
``never came to my attention.''
   When he found out about the request, he said, he ordered that
the subcommitee be provided all the information it wanted.
   ``The material was out in the field,'' Rhoades said. ``It took
time to gather.''
   Rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative and he
directed his subordinates to be open with the committee as soon as
he heard an investigation was underway.
   DeConcini said none of the other eight government agencies being
investigated by his special committee has been as difficult as the
IHS.
   ``Unlike every other federal agency we have examined, the Indian
Health Service has been singularly uncooperative with our
committee's investigation,'' he said.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., called it ``stonewalling.''

<HEAD>High Court Rules Against Prisoners Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's prison inmates again find
themselves in a legal position they have faced often in the 1980s _
losers in a Supreme Court decision.
   The court, continuing to limit rights behind bars, gave prison
officials broad power Monday to decide what inmates may read and
who may visit them.
   In a pair of 6-3 rulings, the court made it easier for officials
to censor inmate reading materials and said inmates generally do
not have to be told why they are prohibited from having visitors.
   The court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at
federal prisons the wardens believe is ``detrimental to the
security, good order or discipline of the institution or ... might
facilitate criminal activity.''
   The justices ordered further hearings to determine whether
inmates should be allowed to read any of 46 publications federal
officials want to ban.
   Among the publications on the list, for example, was an issue of
The Call, a left-wing newspaper that included an article charging
``inhumane treatment ... by racist guards'' in federal prisons.
   Government lawyers had told the justices that between Sept. 1,
1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, some 1,700 publications were withheld out
of 1.8 million sent to federal inmates.
   In the prison visits case, Kentucky officials had argued that
regulations covering aspects of prison life from job assignments to
telephone privileges could be jeopardized by giving inmates a
due-process right to an explanation each time they are denied some
privilege.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court in both rulings
against the inmates. Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan
and John Paul Stevens dissented in each one.
   In both cases, the court reversed rulings that had favored the
inmates _ a result not uncommon during the past decade.
   In a key 1984 ruling, the court said inmates have absolutely no
right of privacy. The justices said inmates cannot depend on the
Constitution to protect them from allegedly unreasonable _ or even
malicious _ searches of their cells and seizure of their property
by prison guards.
   In 1981, the court ruled it is not automatically
unconstitutional to house two inmates in a cell designed for one.
   A 1983 ruling allowed prison officials to put inmates in
solitary confinement indefinitely after only an informal hearing,
even in states that have special laws to protect prisoners' rights.
   The court that year also ruled that state officials may transfer
inmates to another state at their own discretion, even if it means
the inmates will be thousands of miles from home.
   In 1985, the court ruled that officials do not immediately have
to supply reasons when they bar inmates from calling witnesses at
disciplinary hearings.
   And in 1987, the court upheld a rule that prohibits
correspondence between inmates in different prisons.
   In other matters Monday, the court:
   _Reinstated a Charlotte, N.C., man's lawsuit against five city
police officers by ruling unanimously that people who sue over
alleged police brutality must prove only that the officers acted
unreasonably, not ``maliciously and sadistically.''
   _Ruled unanimously in a case from New York City that civil fines
heaped on top of criminal penalties sometimes amount to
unconstitutional double jeopardy, multiple punishment for the same
crime.
   _Agreed to decide in a Pennsylvania case whether the Bush
administration may have to start giving Supplemental Security
Income benefits to, potentially, more than 250,000 disabled
children.
   _Turned down the appeal of an Oklahoma couple sentenced to two
years in prison for their ill child's death because they relied on
prayer and divine intervention rather than seek medical care.
   _Let stand a Massachusetts court's ruling that the public has no
constitutional right of access to a court document sealed by a
judge during a much-publicized murder prosecution.
   _Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Texas case, that investors who allege
they have been defrauded by their brokers must submit the dispute
to arbitration and may not sue in court if they have signed a
contract calling for such arbitration.
   _Refused to kill a California horse-racing figure's libel suit
against a newspaper, The Fresno Bee.

<HEAD>Navy Will Still Use Ozone-Depleting Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy says it will continue to use
chemicals that deplete the earth's ozone layer, despite America's
role as a leader in the effort to protect the globe's atmosphere.
   The substances are crucial to Navy vessels and airplanes and it
will take two or three decades to replace them, the service said
Monday.
   Forcing the Navy to use other chemicals in the near future might
hurt the service's mission of national defense, Navy officials said.
   In written testimony to a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee, the Navy said it uses four chlorofluorocarbons _
CFC's _ as refrigerants and cleaning agents and two related
chemicals as firefighting agents.
   ``These chemicals allow us to cool, protect and clean vital
electronics and weapons systems,'' the Navy told Rep. John D.
Dingell, chairman of the panel's investigations subcommittee. ``We
cannot over-emphasize the importance of these chemicals to our
mission performance.''
   ``Given the current absence of acceptable substitutes and the
long lead times needed to change major shipboard systems, we do not
foresee complete elimination of these chemicals on Navy ships for
20 to 30-years.''
   Ozone-depleters are chemicals which are non-toxic when released
into the atmosphere, but which break apart into other chemical
substances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up and rise
15 to 20 miles into the stratosphere.
   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more
of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach earth, causing more skin
cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.
   Dingell's panel heard testimony from Bush administration
witnesses to assess progress of the Montreal Protocol, an
international agreement that commits the United States and other
signers to a 50 percent reduction in production and consumption of
ozone-depleting chemicals by 1998.
   President Bush has said the United States prefers to negotiate
with signatory countries for a total phase-out by the end of the
century if safe alternatives are available.
   An Environmental Protection Agency official testified that the
administration will strictly police industry testing of CFC
substitutes to make sure proposed replacements are safe. The
position was a major policy change.
   William Rosenberg, assistant administrator of air and radiation,
said EPA will now require chemical firms to report results of
health and safety tests of the substitutes, and would not hesitate
to order more tests if they are warranted.
   Dingell said he was worried the EPA was rushing to approve
alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons without ensuring their safety.
   Two months ago, the General Accounting Office sharply rebuked
EPA, saying the agency was relying too much on voluntary
cooperation by the chemical industry to provide EPA with test
results on proposed substitutes.
   ``It is a bit of shift,'' said EPA spokesman Chris Rice of
Rosenberger's statement. ``It means we're taking the affirmative
step of requiring firms to report data on toxicity of CFC
substitutes.''
   An EPA source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said:
``We were taking lot of grief. We didn't think the grief was
justified, and we're taking the path of least resistance.''

   A speeding train rammed into a bus
packed with wedding guests at an unmanned railroad crossing in
western Gujarat state, killing 47 people, news reports said today.
   Both Press Trust of India and United News of India said 26
people died at the scene of Monday night's crash in the remote

   All of the dead were in a minibus and were heading home after
attending a wedding, the news agencies said. UNI said the victims
included at least nine women and 15 children.
   The injured were taken to a hospital in Porbander, the nearest
big town and birthplace of Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi, leader of
the nonviolent freedom movement that brought about India's
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Porbander is about 560 miles southwest of New Delhi on the

   An isolation researcher thinks she has two
months to go in her underground hideaway when in fact it's only a
matter of weeks that she'll see her first daylight since
mid-January.
   Stefania Follini, a 27-year-old interior decorator from Italy,
has been in a two-room, 200-square-foot Plexiglas house under the
hills west of Carlsbad since Jan. 13, without sunlight or other
ways of measuring time.
   The only sounds she hears are those of her own voice, her
guitar, or an occasional buzzer sounded by researchers in a
computer-equipped trailer on the surface, 50 feet above her.
   ``The buzzer is just to get her attention,'' said Rita
Fraschini, interpreter and spokeswoman for Italian researchers who
are sponsoring the experiment along with various U.S. universities
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   For about four months, the computer terminals have been Ms.
Follini's only mode of communication as she simulates what it might
be like for space travelers isolated for extended periods.
   A team of researchers monitor her with three video cameras and
microphones, and they type in occasional messages to her computer.
   They also track her temperature, heart rate and blood pressure
and test her blood composition for any hormonal and other chemical
changes. Ms. Follini sends up samples daily by means of a cannister
on a string.
   Questioned May 4, Ms. Follini said she thought it was March 7.
However, at the request of The Associated Press, researcher Andrea
Galvagno asked Ms. Follini to guess how far off her estimate was.
She was not told the AP was asking or that anybody else was in the
trailer.
   She guessed she might be two weeks off.
   Asked if she meant March 21, she replied in Italian on her
keyboard, ``About, but I'll celebrate spring a little later.''
   Galvagno said Ms. Follini will come out of the cave May 23 but
will not be told until the afternoon of May 22.
   Ms. Follini wasn't able to keep track of the time by her
menstrual cycle because it stopped after she went underground,
Galvagno said.
   Galvagno and lead researcher Maurizio Montalbini have maintained
a careful record of her sleeping patterns for the four months. For
April 28-29, for example, she was awake 25 hours and slept 12;
April 29-30 she spent 25 hours awake and four asleep; May 1 she was
up 11{ hours, then slept 4{; and May 2, she was up 17 and slept
seven.
   Ms. Follini also has lost about 20 pounds. She passes her time
reading, strumming, humming, writing messages on the computer and
playing chess with herself.
   For the first few months, Ms. Follini was ``kind of grouchy,''
but in the last month she has become accustomed to her situation
and is concentrating better, Ms. Fraschini said.
   Also, she said, Ms. Follini spent more time exploring the cave
outside the enclosure in the early going but seldom heads out any
more except to deliver her blood samples.
   Ms. Follini said she doesn't think there would be much
difference between being isolated in space and being confined in a
cave.
   She said it might be impossible to rescue her from space, but if
the cave collapsed, it would be hard to save her here as well.
   Still, she said, there is some comfort knowing her colleagues
are just 50 feet above.
   ``I prefer to have my feet on the dear, old Earth _ or under
it,'' she said.

   Federal Reserve policy makers are likely to
adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward further interest rate hikes as
they scrutinize the economy for signs inflation has abated,
economists say.
   Signs of slower economic growth abounded as members of the
Federal Open Market Committee gathered for a closed-door meeting
today to set interest rate and monetary policy through June.
   But many analysts said it remains unclear whether the slowdown
has been sufficient to curb accelerating price increases and most
said they expected the central bank to leave credit policies
unchanged.
   The 12-member committee, composed of Federal Reserve Board
members and regional Fed bank presidents, meets in secret eight
times a year. The decisions made at today's meeting won't be
revealed until early July.
   ``This will be a time when they can sit back and relax a bit and
wait for further evidence,'' predicted former Fed member Lyle
Gramley, now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America. ``They ought to be breathing a bit of a sigh of relief.''
   The Fed has been walking a tightrope since March 1988 as it
engineered a rise in short-term interest rates of about 3
percentage points.
   Its aim has been to cool the economy just enough to prevent
inflation from spiraling out of control but not so much as to
topple the country into a recession.
   Finally, after months of increasingly tighter money, it looks
like the Fed is getting what it wants _ slower but continued growth
coupled with moderating price increases.
   In April, retail sales rose a less-than-expected 0.4 percent,
the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.3 percent and industrial
production rebounded only moderately from two weak months.
   Wholesale-price inflation, excluding a large spurt in gasoline
prices, actually dropped. That report Friday sent a wave of
euphoria through financial markets and pushed stocks to a
post-crash high.
   However, it was only a few months ago _ in January and February
_ that wholesale prices showed back-to-back surges of 1 percent,
and economists said the Fed isn't likely to declare victory over
inflation just yet.
   ``You can't afford to jump to conclusions on one month's
report,'' Gramley said. ``Inflation is like a glacier; once it gets
started its awfully hard to stop.''
   ``There are signs wage inflation is starting to heat up,''
agreed economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm.
   Average hourly wages shot up 0.7 percent in April. Also,
Bethlehem Steel Corp. workers won an immediate 8 percent wage hike
earlier this month and Los Angeles teachers are seeking a 21
percent raise over two years.
   ``If that sort of thing becomes common, the Fed is going to have
to hit the brakes hard and that's almost certainly going to turn
into a recession,'' Wyss said.
   But economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, predicted Fed officials would ``ever
so subtly ease back a bit.''
   ``I think the way that they will do it is to go to a neutral
stance, meaning they will be just as willing to ease or tighten. In
previous meetings they have always been balanced toward restraint.
That's a subtle shift, but it will be an important one,'' Jones
said.
   William C. Dunkelberg, dean of the Temple University business
school, said unchanged policy would permit interest rates, which
have edged down a bit over the last month, to drift a little
further if the market sees additional signs of slower growth or
moderating price hikes.
   ``If, in fact, the economy really is slowing down some, that
should reduce the demand for credit and that should put downward
pressure on interest rates without Fed action,'' Dunkelberg said.
   One analyst, economist Paul W. Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates
in Baltimore, said the Fed, fearing that the sluggishness it
induced could get out of hand, may even lean explicitly toward
easier money.
   ``I think from their perspective a recession would be a
calamity. It would stop the ... process (of reducing the budget
deficit), it would greatly exacerbate the S&amp;L problem by causing
widespread bankruptcies and it would create problems with Third
World debt,'' Boltz said.
   Indeed, the Bush administration, which is counting on lower
interest rates to help it pursue its economic agenda, has changed
the tenor of its comments about the Fed from criticism to cautious
praise.
   ``It appears the Federal Reserve has paused to see what
cumulative effect their tightening has had,'' Michael Boskin,
President Bush's chief economic adviser, said in a speech last
week. ``That, it seems to me, is a sensible thing to do.''

   Saying the government's case was tainted,
Oliver North's lawyers are renewing a motion made before his
conviction to dismiss criminal charges against him because of his
1987 congressional testimony.
   North ``submits that it is impossible as a matter of law for the
government to make the requisite showing that no use has been
made'' of his congressional testimony given under a grant of
immunity, his lawyers asserted.
   The government made the ``extraordinary decision'' to compel
testimony from North, ``to broadcast his testimony to tens of
millions of people around the world, and then to indict and try him
for the matters as to which he had previously testified,'' North's
defense team said in a court filing Monday.
   North was convicted May 5 of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, destroying government documents and of taking an
illegal gratuity.
   If the court doesn't dismiss the indictment, a court hearing
ought to be held in which the government would attempt to show the
case was not tainted by his immunized testimony, said North's
lawyers.
   In a 1972 case entitled Kastigar v. United States, the Supreme
Court held that any direct or indirect use against a defendant of
testimony given under a grant of use immunity violates the Fifth
Amendment.
   North's lawyers submitted a 10-page list of documents and
information they said the prosecution must produce before any
hearing. They said any such inquiry includes a
``witness-by-witness, item-by-item showing'' of the sources for all
evidence presented by grand jury and trial witnesses.
   North says the prosecution must produce all materials in its
office referring to steps taken to comply with the requirement that
no use be made of the immunized testimony.
   North's lawyers said they want the prosecution to produce any
information showing how news reports were censored in the office to
eliminate information derived from the immunized testimony.
   ``This is not limited to news stories but also includes, for
example, political cartoons, presidential press conferences, talk
shows, and entertainment such as Johnny Carson's `Tonight Show,'
`Sesame Street,' Bob Hope's specials, or `Saturday Night Live,'''
said the court filing.
   North's attorneys asked for ``all redacted or screened copies of
every newspaper, magazine, periodical or other documentary
material, or any electronic transmission, which any member of the
IC staff read, saw, or heard'' after North was granted immunity.

   Trying to seize Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega to face drug charges in the United States
would be a mistake, former President Carter said.
   ``The best thing we could do for Noriega and the worst thing we
could do for ourselves is to send Marines into Panama and try to
catch this man,'' Carter told the Arkansas Bankers Association on
Monday.
   ``We shouldn't do anything in a belligerent way in Panama
because it would only lead to making Noriega a hero and he doesn't
deserve it.
   ``It would play into his hands and would make us undertake a
very bloody operation that might be unsuccessful,'' Carter said.
``It would also alienate every other nation in this hemisphere if
we invaded Panama.''
   Carter was among the international monitors in Panama for the
May 7 presidential elections. The opposition claimed victory, but
the Noriega-backed government nullified the presidential elections.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug charges.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple growers are halting use of Alar in the
wake of decreasing apple sales because of reports linking the
controversial chemical to cancer.
   The International Apple Institute said its members have decided
to stop using Alar, which regulates growth and extends the shelf
life of the fruit.
   ``By September of this year, the already low levels of Alar will
be reduced to virtually zero,'' Derl I. Derr, president of the
International Apple Institute, based in nearby McLean, Va., said
Monday in a news conference. ``Simply, the U.S. apple industry is
not going to use Alar.''
   ``This action is not taken because we believe there is a health
risk associated with Alar, but because public confusion reigns
supreme and consumer confidence in apples is faltering,'' the
industry spokesman said.
   The Food and Drug Administration estimated on March 16 that Alar
was used on 10 percent of the nation's apple supply.
   Industry spokesmen say sales have been hurt severely by consumer
reaction to news reports focusing on assertions that Alar poses a
risk of cancer, particularly to children.
   Derr's prediction came as two new requests were made to the EPA
for an immediate ban on Alar. The requests came from the Natural
Resources Defense Council and consumer activist Ralph Nader.
   Janet S. Hathaway, an attorney for the NRDC, said at a news
conference that Alar will be applied to this year's crop in June if
the EPA does not take emergency action.
   Last weeekend, the EPA announced it has started a procedure that
could lead to an Alar ban in about 18 months, but Ms. Hathaway said
that wasn't quick enough.
   ``We believe that there is only one way to restore public
confidence, restore apple sales and protect public health,'' Ms.
Hathaway said. ``A total ban under EPA's suspension powers should
occur as of today.''
   EPA spokesman Al Heier said, ``The data we now have available is
preliminary data. We will get the final data by early next year and
at that time we hope to be able to take final cancellation action.''
   ``We do not believe eating apples or any food that has been
treated with Alar poses a grave risk. We think there is some risk,
but we think the risk is small for the additional year'' before the
EPA ban takes effect, he said.
   On Capitol Hill, Nader told the Senate subcommittee on toxic
substances that Congress ``should ban Alar by name, unilaterally
and immediately.''
   Nader said there is ``a convergence'' of interest between
consumers who don't want Alar on apples and apple growers hurt by
plummeting sales. He maintained the only opposition to an immediate
ban comes from suppliers of Alar, or daminozide.

   Here, at a glance, are main provisions of the
$1.2 billion anti-crime package President Bush proposed Monday.
   Bush would:
   _Make permanent a ban on imported semiautomatic assault rifles _
if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms rules they are not
for sport _ but allow U.S. manufacturers to keep making and selling
such weapons.
   _Ban semiautomatic ammunition clips of more than 15 rounds.
   _Double the current five-year minimum sentence for using a
semiautomatic firearm in a crime.
   _Block the practice of dropping many gun-use charges through
plea bargaining.
   _Spend $1 billion for new prison construction; identify
government properties and facilities for conversion to jails and
prisons.
   _Execute people who commit such federal offenses as murder for
hire, killings by federal prisoners serving life sentences,
terrorist murders of American citizens, and murders of hostages.
Also allow executions for such crimes as treason and espionage
under provisions now in disuse because statutes do not satisfy
Supreme Court guidelines.
   _Authorize 825 new federal agents and staff in the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals Service and the
FBI.
   _Amend the Armed Career Criminal statute to include juvenile
convictions when deciding whether someone is a habitual criminal
and thus subject to an enhanced sentence.
   _Expand the existing ban on firearm sales to people convicted of
certain violent crimes, to cover anyone convicted of violent
misdemeanor offenses.
   _Add 1,600 positions in federal prosecutors' offices.

<HEAD>Authorities: Engineer on Runaway Train Silent on Faulty Brakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA METZLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineer at the rear of a
runaway freight train that killed four people knew the brakes
weren't working on one of the engines but failed to notify the lead
engineer, investigators said.
   Engineer Larry Hill was interviewed by federal investigators
Monday along with his brakeman, Robert Waterbury. Hill was in
charge of guiding the brakes on the train's rear engines while the
lead engineer, Frank Holland, who was injured in Friday's crash,
watched the front ones.
   The Southern Pacific freight train jumped the tracks at 90 mph
Friday on a curve trains are supposed to take at 30 mph. Cars
slammed into six homes, burying two boys who died and killing two
crewmen.
   The brakes were faulty on at least two of the train's six
locomotives, the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday.
   ``We learned that as the train crested the hill, engineer
Holland radioed Hill asking if he was giving all that he had, all
the dynamic braking that he had,'' said James Kolstad, acting NTSB
chairman.
   Hill answered ``yes,'' even though he told investigators he was
aware the dynamic brakes weren't working, Kolstad said Monday night.
   ``We asked him why there was not more communication, and he did
not have an answer,'' Kolstad said. The engineers also did not
communicate in the moments before the train plunged through the
homes, Kolstad said.
   Locomotives have two kinds of braking systems. Air brakes apply
pressure to the wheels, much like a car, while dynamic braking uses
the engine to slow the train, similar to downshifting in a car.
   Investigators also interviewed workers who loaded the train with
sandy sodium carbonate, which is used to make potash, in Rosamond,
said Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman.
   A shipping document indicated ``each of the hopper cars had
about a two-thirds load, but we have witnesses that say some of the
cars were loaded up to the edge,'' he said.
   Crew members may not have known how heavy their train was and
may have miscalculated the braking capability during their descent
from 4,109-foot Cajon Pass into the Los Angeles basin, said
Lopatkiewicz.
   On Sunday night, investigators said two of the train's five
crewman had previous safety violations. Tests to indicate if the
crew was using alcohol or drugs on Friday were incomplete,
authorities said.
   Holland was cited for driving a train too fast in March 1986 and
for failing to connect brake lines properly between locomotives in
February 1988, Kolstad said. Holland was in fair condition Monday
with a collapsed lung in the intensive-care unit at St. Bernardine
Medical Center.
   Brakeman Allan R. Riess, who was killed, had been cited in
October for failing to act when an engineer exceeded authorized
speed, Kolstad said.
   Conductor Everett S. Crown of Bakersfield, who also was killed,
had no violations on his record. The records of Waterbury, 57, and
Hill, 42, who escaped serious injury, were unavailable.
   NTSB officials examined crew members' job records for any
pattern of recklessness. But Lopatkiewicz said, ``it is not unusual
after a number of years on the line for trainmen to have violations
on their record.''
   Riess' brother-in-law, Dale Jenkins, said the 43-year-old
Bakersfield man had failed to report the October incident because
of tremendous pressure from superiors at work. But he said, ``Allan
was real conscientious.''
   Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera declined to comment on
crew safety violations, saying the NTSB had asked the railroad not
to talk about the investigation while it continued.
   About 250 people remained at hotels Monday because of the
accident that wrecked their neighborhood, authorities said.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
speech Monday unveiling his package of anti-crime proposals at a
police memorial service outside the Capitol before a rain-drenched
crowd.
   If it doesn't start clearing up, we're issuing snorkels to
everybody out there. ...
   I want to say how pleased I am that the secretary of the
Treasury is with me, Nick Brady; our attorney general, the able
Dick Thornburgh; and our drug czar, Secretary Bill Bennett.
   The fact that we four are here is intentional, it sends a signal
of our commitment and of our interest.
   And I know members of Congress are here as well.
   I spotted my own senator, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and
Senator Pete Wilson.
   But I'm going to be in trouble because I can't see over there
who else is there, but I know many are sitting right over here, and
we salute them.
   I see Senator Ford and others, and we're just delighted that
they're here today. (Applause).
   Last fall, a retired New York police lieutenant gave me badge
number 14072, and I have it with me here today, the badge his son
wore the day he was gunned down by a gang of cocaine cowards.
   Matt Byrne asked me to keep Eddie's badge as a reminder of all
the brave police officers who put their lives on the line for us
every single day.
   Matt, your son's badge, as I have told you, is kept in my desk
at the Oval Office.
   And during the debate on gun-related violence that has raged in
this country the past several months, neither it nor what it
represents has ever been far from my mind.
   I've heard the many voices, the courageous and the
compassionate, the wounded and the widowed.
   And I salute the survivors who are here today.
   We gather today to respond to those voices and to honor the
fallen by launching a national strategy, a partnership with
America's cities and states to take back the streets.
   It calls for a return to common sense, and it begins with a
clear-eyed vision of the kind of problems we face, the kind of
people we are, the kind of values that we hold, and the kind of
nation we intend to bequeath to our children.
   The problem is violent crime, and in particular the blood that's
been shed by increasingly sophisticated guns in the hands of a new
class of criminals.
   Usually, but not always, the deaths are tied to a cycle of
dollars and drugs and dependency.
   The principles are simple.
   My generation will remember what some believe was FDR's finest
speech _ the four freedoms _ an address to a joint session of the
Congress.
   And the last, often forgotten but arguably the most fundamental
of those freedoms was simply this: freedom from fear.
   Our sworn duty to ensure domestic tranquility is as old as the
republic, placed in the Constitution's preamble even before the
common defense and the general welfare.
   And so when we ask what kind of society the American people
deserve, our goal must be a nation in which law-abiding citizens
are safe and feel safe.
   To achieve this goal, people must be held accountable for their
actions, and that's common sense.
   Most Americans are law-abiding.
   And most believe that there is such a thing as right and wrong,
good and evil.
   And whether it's the brutalization of a young runner in a park
or terrorizing a young man onto a crowded highway, these are acts
that cannot be excused or explained away.
   A common sense approach to crime means that, if we're going to
affect people's behavior, we must have a criminal justice system in
which there is an expectation that, if you commit a crime, you will
be caught, and if caught, you will be prosecuted, and if convicted,
you will do time. (Applause.)

<TEXT>
   For far too long, a privileged class of violent and repeat
offenders have calculated that crime really does pay, that our
criminal justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth
the rewards.
   Well, it's time we changed the odds and upped the stakes
enormously.
   And we will lead the way.
   We'll do our part and then some.
   But no federal effort can succeed without the full partnership
of the cities and the states that you so nobly represent.
   Unfortunately, nowhere is your front line role more evident than
in the honor roll that will be read today of 161 officers killed in
the line of duty last year; 152 were state or local cops, and you
are the first line of defense, and your respective governments have
an obligation to adopt tough legislation and provide the resources
in police, prosecutors and prisons to fully back you up.
   At the trial of Eddie Byrne's executioners, there was testimony
that the hit was ordered from prison to send a message to the
people behind the badge, and one witness said that they hoped to
see the attack on the television news at Rikers Island.
   Well today, we have a message of our own.
   We're going to take back the streets by taking criminals off the
streets.
   And it's an attack _ (applause) _ it is an attack on all four
fronts: new laws to punish them, new agents to arrest them, new
prosecutors to convict them, and new prisons to hold them.
(Applause.)
   I am announcing today, and there is no more fitting place than
right here, a comprehensive new offensive for combatting violent
crime _ for Eddie Byrne, for every officer we honor here today, and
for America.
   The first front of this campaign, new laws, starts with the
semiautomatic and so-called assault weapons that criminals have
taken as their gun of choice, and again, common sense has to play
an important part in this discussion.
   The fact of the matter is nearly half the households in this
country have guns, and guns are already out there.
   And the overwhelming majority are legitimately owned for
legitimate purposes.
   But in contrast to legitimate gun ownership is the chilling fact
that something like 80 percent of all firearms used by felons are
stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.
   Throughout our nation's history, the hard lesson we've learned
is that criminals will get guns.
   And so let me be very clear about our response.

<HEAD>WASHN: our response.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The right to own a gun is not a license to harm others.
   And so, first, I am calling on Congress today to do for
dangerous firearms what is wisely done for dangerous drugs, to
double the mandatory minimum penalties for the use of semiautomatic
weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs.
   And the math is simple.
   Anyone who uses a semiautomatic for crime or so much as has one
on them during a crime will do an automatic 10 extra years in
federal prison, no probation _ (applause) _ no parole _ (applause)
_ no matter which judge they get. (Applause.)
   And secondly, we just can't just plea bargain away the lives of
your loved ones, the lives of our cops and kids.
   And I'm directing the attorney general to advise America's
prosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearms
offenses.
   Those who use guns will do time, hard time. (Applause.)
   And third, when a criminal carries a gun and someone dies, they
must pay with their own lives. (Applause.)
   We are calling on Congress today to enact the steps necessary to
implement the death penalty and to newly designate the use of a
firearm as an aggravating factor for determining whether the death
sentence should be imposed.
   And I call on America's governors to match this federal
initiative and propose these same three standards at home:
mandatory time, no deals without cooperation, and the death penalty
where appropriate.
   Your states owe it to those here today and to the American
people. (Applause).
   And fourth, two months ago, at my direction, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms suspended the importation of certain
so-called ``assault weapons.''
   BATF is continuing its examination to determine which, if any,
of those weapons are not acceptable under standards in existing law.
   And at the conclusion of this study, and after careful
consideration, we will permanently ban any imports that don't
measure up to these standards.
   Recently, the U.S. News cover story on guns summed up a related
challenge, the difficulty in drafting laws that will separate
assault weapons used in crime from semiautomatics frequently used
for legitimate hunting and sports.
   And there is substantial controversy and debate on this point.
   You're all well aware of that.
   The one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is
that they are invariably equipped with unjustifably large magazines.
   The notorious AKS-47, for example, comes with a magazine that
pumps off 30 explosive bullets without reloading.
   And that is why, fifth, we stand on the steps here in front of
the Capitol, and ask its support for legislation prohibiting the
importation, manufacture, sale or transfer of these insidious gun
magazines of more than 15 rounds.
   The current debate was first sparked when an unstable gunman in
Stockton, Calif., purchased an AKS-47 over the counter and used it
to lay waste to an elementary school playground.
   Patrick Edward Purdy had no business buying that gun.
   He was arrested on his first weapons charge before his 15th
birthday.
   And by his fourth firearms arrest, Purdy had finally turned 18,
and with it, chalked up the first of two adult convictions.
   Although for violent and weapons offenses, both convictions were
misdemeanors.
   Purdy crawled through the loophole that bars only felons from
buying guns and got that deadly AKS-47.
   That is outrageous.
   And therefore, we also propose that Congress close this
``Purdy'' loophole and others like it, that allow deadly weapons to
fall into deadly hands.
   Again, that's just plain common sense.
   We must not allow deadly weapons to fall into deadly hands.

   But we need to do more than just enact new laws.
   And in a recent movie about the L.A. gang wars, a woman shouts
encouragement to a cop on patrol, telling him, ``You get them off
the streets.''
   And he answers, ``Lady, we're trying.''
   And the woman offers a four-word solution, ``You need more
help.''
   And believe me, we know it.
   Our police need more help.
   And I'm here today to tell you that we're prepared to match
rhetoric with resources and call on our cities and states to do the
same.
   The second front, if you will, of course, new offensive, calls
for increased manpower and a new strategy on guns, a strategy based
on models of proven effectiveness.
   I have directed the attorney general and the treasury secretary,
working together with state and local enforcement, to launch a
comprehensive, coordinated offensive against our nation's most
violent criminals.
   And I am requesting funding for hiring 825 new federal agents
and staff _ 375 at ATF, 300 at the FBI, and 150 deputy U.S.
marshals.
   Many of these hirings will permit experienced investigators from
all three agencies to promptly combat violent crime in the field.
   Of course, arresting these thugs doesn't help if we don't have
the muscle to prosecute each criminal to the fullest extent of the
law.
   And that's why the third front of this campaign calls for
Congress to back up these new troops with 1,600 new prosecutors and
staff.
   And now there probably isn't a police officer here who hasn't
seen a case where a dangerous felon, properly arrested, fully
prosecuted, and sentenced to the maximum, walks out of jail early,
sometimes years early, because prisons are bursting at the seam.
   That is not right.
   Part of our common sense approach is a simple recognition that
it doesn't do any good to provide new federal agents, new assistant
U.S. attorneys, and new laws with long-term penalties if we don't
have the prison cells to keep criminals where they belong.
   A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and so, as the
fourth front in this comprehensive effort, I am calling on the
Congress to authorize an additional $1 billion over and above the
$500 million already slated for 1990 for federal prison
construction. (Applause.)
   These 24,000 new beds will boost federal prison capacity by
nearly 80 percent.
   Not since Lincoln has a president stood in front of the Capitol
and been just a few miles from the front lines of a war.
   Never was the toll more visible than in the faces of the brave
men and women, the families gathered here today.
   And when I first stood here as president _ over there _ only
moments after taking the office, the oath of office, I made a
promise: This scourge will stop.
   And that's a promise that we intend to keep.
   Ladies and gentlemen, I offer my condolences for your fallen
loved ones and for your fellow officers.
   And I salute your commitment, and I salute your courage.
   And as a citizen, grateful for the protection you have provided
for me and my family and my fellow countrymen, I thank you and I
wish you Godspeed.
   Thank you all, and God bless the United States of America.
   Thank you very much. (Applause.)

<HEAD>Government Study Shows Lower Cholesterol in Eggs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New testing methods and improved farming
practices have led government researchers to conclude that eggs
have 22 percent less cholesterol than previously believed.
   A study released Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the industry-supported Egg Nutrition Center found the average
large egg has 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol.
   The government has said since 1976 that eggs contained 274
milligrams.
   Extra large eggs have about 230 milligrams of cholesterol, and
medium eggs about 180 milligrams.
   The study was welcomed by the egg industry, which has seen sales
plummet $1 billion during the past five years after warnings about
the risks of heart disease associated with the fatty substance.
   ``The egg industry has been anxiously awaiting this report,''
said Cathy McCharen, vice president of the Egg Nutrition Center in
Washington, D.C. ``It confirms what we've been saying all along,
that eggs are an important source of nutrients and should not be
eliminated from diets.''
   The change is due to better testing methods and different feed,
husbandry and breeding practices, according to Gary Beecher, chief
of the USDA's Nutrition Information Service. The new figures will
be included in updated versions of the USDA's handbook on the
nutrient composition of foods.
   The fat content of the eggs also was slightly lower than
previously reported, with an average of 5 grams total fat per large
egg.
   The study also confirmed that eggs are a low-calorie source of
protein, Vitamin A, riboflavin, Vitamin B-12, iron, zinc,
phosphorus, calcium, potassium and other nutrients. The average
large egg had 75 calories.
   ``I think what it means is that the egg is still a very rich
source of nutrients,'' said Beecher.
   ``The egg has always been considered by the nutrition community
to be an important part of the diet, but cholesterol has given eggs
a bad rap. Now it doesn't appear that the cholesterol level is so
high.''
   The American Heart Association has recommended that the average
adult each day consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol,
a substance found especially in animal fats and helps block blood
vessels.
   People concerned about high cholesterol, which have been
associated with heart disease, should discuss their diet with their
doctor or nutritionist, Beecher said.
   The study examined nearly 2,500 eggs from producers around the
country last summer and this winter.
   ``On average it was representative of all eggs produced in the
United States,'' said Beecher.
   The study was jointly sponsored by the USDA and the egg
industry. The industry paid for the analysis and provided the eggs,
but government researchers designed the tests and analyzed the
results, Beecher said.
   The industry has suffered in recent years from worries about
cholesterol and other factors.
   ``People aren't eating breakfast as much, and women are not home
baking all the time,'' said McCharen.
   Egg sales fell to $3.1 billion in 1988, from $4.1 billion in
1984. Egg production has been flat during that period _ 69.5
billion eggs were produced in the United States last year _ while
the cost of feed, labor, and other items has risen.

<HEAD>Agencies Seek to Improve Bike Safety, Increase Use of Helmets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies say they'll work together
to boost bicycle safety, including increasing the use of helmets
which officials say are worn by fewer than one in 10 riders.
   Officials of the Consumer Product Safety Commission also said
Monday they are evaluating several types of bicycle helmets to
determine effectiveness in preventing injuries and will consider a
proposal from safety groups to set uniform federal standards.
   An engineer for the commission, John Preston, said testing
indicates that helmets without a hard shell may be just as
effective in absorbing the energy of a fall or collision as those
with a hard shell.
   The comission and the National Highway Safety Administration
signed a memorandum Monday that sets up communication between the
two agencies on bicycle safety research and seeks to coordinate
local and national efforts to increase public understanding of
bicycle safety requirements.
   A group of safety and consumer groups organized as the National
Safe Kids Campaign petitioned the safety commission on Monday to
set performance standards for both adult- and child-size bicycle
helmets. The group said federal standards would help reduce the
1,000 deaths and half-million serious injuries each year in bicycle
accidents.

<NOTE>Bush Administration Says Wheelchair Lift Decision `Burdensome'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public
buses would put a costly burden on transit agencies, Bush
administration officials told a federal appeals court.
   Before Monday's court hearing, 13 disabled spectators were
wheeled into the courtroom. Some spectators wore Revolutionary
War-era hats.
   ``This is the case that will mean independence for disabled
people,'' said Stephen Gold, attorney for Americans Disabled for
Accessible Public Transportation, or ADAPT, which filed the lawsuit
the government is appealing.
   The nation should keep the current system of balancing special
services for the disabled with the costs, U.S. Transportation
Department lawyer Jeffrey Clair told the 3rd U.S. Circuit of
Appeals.
   The case has attracted the attention of dozens of
disabled-rights groups, many angered by the government's decision
to ask the full appeals court to review a decision handed down by a
three-judge panel Feb. 13.
   In the 2-1 decision, the panel ruled the Department of
Transportation failed to provide the handicapped ``equal
accessibility'' as intended by Congress. The judges invalidated a
Transportation Department provision allowing communities to provide
van service instead.
   Clair said requiring lifts on all new buses would be too rigid
and ``overly burdensome.''

<NOTE>Labor Department Says Youth Labor Force Smaller Than Last Summer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of 16- to 24-year-olds seeking work
this summer will be about 706,000 below the level of last year
because of a continued population decline in that age group, the
government says.
   An estimated 3.3 million people in that age group, mostly
students seeking summer jobs and high school and college graduates
looking for permanent jobs, will enter the labor force between now
and July, the Labor Department said.
   It said there were 21.3 million people aged 16 to 24 in the
civilian labor force as of last month and projected the number
would swell to 24.6 million by July, down from 25.3 million last
year.
   The 21.3 million April figure is down from last year as well.
There were 21.6 million 16- to 24-year-olds who either had jobs or
were looking for jobs in April 1988, the department said.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excessive drinking, gridlock and
trashed hotels are causing some residents to question whether the
welcome mat to this spring break mecca should be rolled up.
   When Fort Lauderdale more or less told students to go elsewhere
for their weeks of unbridled partying, Daytona Beach took over as
the nation's top spring break destination.
   It attracted 500,000 students during the four weeks that ended
in early April, according to Georgia Carter, of the tourism
promotion agency Destination Daytona.
   Although students spent $100 million here, they left behind
angry residents who complained about car stereos blaring throughout
the nights on clogged streets, and youths urinating on lawns and
passing out in driveways.
   ``It's basically what happened here,'' said Carolyn Michaels,
assistant director of tourism, convention and business development
for the Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce.
   Fort Lauderdale officials last year adopted plans to renovate
the beachfront area into a family-oriented resort, cracking down on
public drinking and shelving marketing campaigns at college
campuses.
   More than 200 miles north of Fort Lauderdale, Daytona Beach's
success in attracting students has divided residents.
   On one side are those who dread the hordes of drunken students
and on the other are those who see dollar signs for the motels,
hotels, restaurants, bars and gift shops.
   ``Daytona Beach likes to have the money, but they don't want the
problems,'' said Lt. Jimmy Powell, head of the Daytona Beach office
of the state Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco.
   ``Daytona is going to have to decide if they are going to
control it or get rid of the whole thing,'' he said. ``There are a
lot of upset people in Daytona Beach.''
   Many have said enough is enough.
   This is a city election year and politicans are apt to be
responsive to residents' concerns.
   ``A lot of citizens are saying we'll give you one more year'' to
fix the problems of spring break or they'll seek to abolish the
annual rites of spring in much the way that Fort Lauderdale has,
said Dick Moores, immediate past president of the local motel
association.
   ``We are going to solve the spring break problem, we've got
to,'' said Moores, who owns the Daytona Sands Beach Motel.
   Some attribute the problems to Playboy magazine, which featured
a risque pictorial from Daytona Beach in its April issue, and to
MTV, the popular music video channel, which has broadcast live from
``the World's Most Famous Beach'' for the past two years.
   ``MTV gave kids the impression that in Daytona is where anything
goes,'' Moores said. ``We don't want them back.''
   Allan Cohen, whose family owns the Texan Motel, disagrees.
   ``It could be devastating if they (MTV) don't show in Daytona
Beach,'' said Cohen, whose motel was used by MTV this spring.
   For years, he said, tourism officials have worked to attract
young people.
   ``Daytona Beach didn't happen overnight. We've been fighting and
fighting to get the break here. We got the break so big it was
unbelievable,'' Cohen said. ``Everybody got caught with their pants
down.''
   The Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce recently established
subcommittees to address the problems.
   Some of the solutions under consideration include setting up
portable toilets; preventing youngsters from entering residential
neighborhoods near the beach; restricting sales of beer and alcohol
to certain times; banning beach concerts; and taxing beer.
   ``The Number One culprit in the whole thing was over consumption
of alcohol,'' Moores said.
   One of those who dealt daily with the alcohol problem was
Powell, with the state alcoholic beverage division. His office made
1,200 arrests during spring break, but he said he could have made
12,000 arrests if he had enough officers.
   Despite the problems, many are confident about reaching
solutions before next year's invasion.
   ``Everybody is ready to give spring break another shot,'' Cohen
said, ``but they want to see more control.''

dollar like a sponge absorbs water,'' Daiwa Bank dealer Takamasa
Yamasaki said.
   But the currency fell slightly in the afternoon as investors
started to sell it in profit-taking, other traders said.
   Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan sought to support the yen during
the morning session by selling about $400 million. The central bank
does not comment on its activities.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei rose sharply in
the afternoon session as Japanese investors started to buy
high-tech issues.

<HEAD>Mexico Liberalizes Foreign Investment Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ending years of strict protectionism, the
government today radically liberalized foreign investment
regulations in a bid to attract capital to Mexico's debt-crippled
economy.
   The new rules, announced Monday, open to foreign investment
sectors of the economy previously closed to outsiders and increase
the amount of foreign ownership permitted in others.
   In some key areas, such as tourism, Mexico will allow 100
percent foreign ownership. A 1973 law had limited foreign ownership
to 49 percent in most industries and prohibited it altogether from
many others.
   The new regulations take effect a day before negotiations on
restructing Mexico's $107.4 billion foreign debt resume in New
York. Mexico's pledge to move away from a protectionist economy is
a crucial feature of the debt talks.
   ``For technology, modernization, employment, fresh resources and
access to external markets, there is a clear justification and
rationale to permit increased flexibility to foreign investment in
Mexico,'' Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche told a news
conference Monday.
   Many industries considered strategic _ including banking,
petroleum, mineral exploration, electrical generation and
broadcasting _ will remain off-limits to foreigners, he said.
   The government is opening previously closed areas such as auto
parts, telecommunications, fishing and petrochemicals production. A
maximum of 49 percent foreign investment will be allowed in these
areas.
   Areas previously limited to 49 percent foreign ownership that
will be expanded to make foreign majority ownership possible
include glass, cement, iron, steel and cellulose.
   ``No country can modernize without attracting fresh
investment,'' Serra Puche said. ``The tendency in the world is
moving toward interdependence.''
   The new regulations follow other economic reforms, including a
wage-and-price control program that cut inflation from a record 159
percent in 1987 to 51.7 percent last year.
   Under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the government also
has sold or closed some state-owned industries.
   Tourism, Mexico's second-largest earner of foreign exchange, had
been limited to 49 percent foreign ownership. Now 100 percent
foreign ownership will be allowed.
   Serra Puche said that in contrast to the old, the new
regulations will simplify and clarify investment procedures. He
said approval for 100 percent outside ownership will be automatic
in many cases.
   There has been nearly no growth in the Mexican economy because
of the nation's foreign debt and low oil prices.
   Mexican officials say foreign capital is essential to creating
jobs, importing high technology and stimulating exports and
productivity. The Commerce Department said foreign investment
totalled $3.1 billion last year.
   The new rules will consolidate regulations pertaining to the
border ``maquiladora'' industry, Serra Puche said, but not change
them.
   Under the maquiladora program, foreign-made parts are imported
duty-free to Mexico for final assembly. When the finished product
is exported to the United States, the United States taxes only the
labor or the value added in Mexico.
   Speculation that foreign investment restrictions would be eased
was sparked recently when Tourism Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez
returned from a visit to Europe and announced several resort hotel
projects involving Spanish and West German firms.
   Much of Mexico's tourism is along its coasts and the new rules
will double the length of beachfront property leases from 30 years
to 60 years, Serra Puche said. The constitution prohibits outright
foreign ownership of coastal real estate.

<HEAD>Producer Wins Battle Not to Testify in Murder Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness who said he helped dispose of
murder weapons implicated four people in the slaying of a producer
but never mentioned former Paramount production chief Robert Evans,
who won a battle not to testify.
   The slaying has been linked to Evans' movie ``The Cotton Club,''
and police reports have suggested that witnesses will implicate
Evans. The producer invoked Fifth Amendment protection against self
incrimination.
   Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay had threatened to jail Evans, who
is not charged in the slaying of New York theatrical producer Roy
Radin, for contempt for refusing to testify.
   But on Monday, McKay said she was swayed by arguments from
Evans' attorney, who cited a report in Saturday's Los Angeles Times
that Evans has been linked by two potential witnesses to the
killing.
   Evans, producer of such hits as ``The Godfather,''
``Chinatown,'' and ``Love Story,'' had been scheduled as the first
witness in a preliminary hearing.
   But on Monday, as he listened nervously, McKay and supervising
Municipal Court Judge David Horwitz excused him from testifying.
They based their rulings on the published reports. Evans' lawyer
has said in court Evans is ``absolutely innocent of any
involvement'' and would testify if granted immunity from
prosecution.
   ``At this point, unless the people are prepared to offer Mr.
Evans immunity as a witness, he cannot be forced to testify in the
Radin matter,'' said McKay.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn refused to give him immunity
and told reporters he would not reconsider that decision.
   The hearing's first witness was Carl Plzak, who worked as a
security guard for defendant Karen Delayne ``Laynie'' Greenberger
and for former Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who is not a
defendant.
   Mrs. Greenberger, also known as Elaine Jacobs, is credited with
having introduced Evans and Radin who negotiated financing of ``The
Cotton Club.'' She is charged with murder as are three former Flynt
security guards, William Molony Mentzer, Alex Lamota Marti and
William Ulmer Lowe. Lowe is fighting extradition in Maryland.
   The hearing is to determine if there is enough evidence for the
defendants to stand trial.
   Plzak testified that all four defendants were involved in
Radin's killing and that it was related to a theft of cocaine and
money. He said he helped the defendants get rid of the murder
weapons.
   Evans was in the midst of negotiations with Radin to raise funds
for ``The Cotton Club'' in 1983 when the producer disappeared. At
the time, a dispute had arisen about Mrs. Greenberger's demand for
part of the film's profits.
   Radin was seen stepping into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger
on May 13, 1983, en route to dinner at the fashionable La Scala
restaurant in Beverly Hills. His body was found a month later in a
dry riverbed 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot in the
head.

<TEXT>
   The story of a cult of drug smugglers
blamed for 15 slayings in northern Mexico has been put to music in
a ballad that's being played by Spanish-language radio stations.
   ``Tragedy in Matamoros'' is a traditional ``corrido'' played in
waltz time with guitars and accordion.
   Corridos for years in Mexico have been used to tell about
important historical events or social problems. Their themes often
relate to the plight, problems and concerns of immigrants. They
also were used to spread news and deliver messages.
   Corridos are popular along U.S.-Mexico border and among the
Chicano culture.
   ``Tragedy in Matamoros,'' by the group Suspiros de Salamanca,
mentions by name only Sara Aldrete, who authorities said was the
cult's ``godmother'' and is in custody in Mexico City.
   The song also refers to ``El Padrino,'' the Godfather, Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo.
   Constanzo, the cult's charismatic leader, is believed to have
directed the killings at Santa Elena Ranch near Matamoros, as well
as slayings in Mexico City. On May 6, Constanzo reportedly ordered
one of his followers to kill him and another man as police were
closing in on their Mexico City hideout.
   The ``young American'' in the lyrics is Mark Kilroy, a
University of Texas student abducted while in Matamoros during a
spring break outing.
   Kilroy's body was one of 15 unearthed at or near the ranch. Some
of the victims were sacrificed in occult rituals designed to bring
magical protection for the drug-smuggling, suspects and police have
said.
   Andres Cantu, production director at KBOR-AM in Brownsville,
across the Rio Grande from Matamoros, said it was inevitable that
the story would become a corrido.
   ``This is the first one,'' Cantu said. ``There are going to be
other versions coming out.''
   Some listeners call and request the song, he said.
   At KGBT-AM in Harlingen, program director Rogelio Botello said
``Tragedy in Matamoros'' is the most popular corrido this week.
   ``It is getting some play here in Houston, also in Dallas, Fort
Worth and San Antonio,'' said Albino Garcia, with sales promotion
at Ramex Records, the Houston-based company distributing the
recording to stations.
   ``We're taking quite a few orders now,'' Garcia said.
   Here is a translation of the lyrics:
   ``There the devil did fail them,
   Satanic murderers.
   They say Sarita Aldrete
   And that Cuban `El Padrino'
   Are the main ones responsible
   For everything that has happened.
   In Brownsville and Matamoros
   They all started trembling
   Because that satanic gang,
   They are not afraid to kill.
   That's how they prayed to the devil,
   In order to triumph in all that they do.
   The parents were very worried
   About their beloved son.
   That young American,
   Well, he had been lost
   On the 14th of March
   While he was out with some friends.
   They say that some `federales'
   They caught a snitch.
   `We will protect you.
   Give us some good information.
   The Santa Elena Ranch,
   It looks like a cemetery there.
   Now I say good goodbye from here,
   From Rancho Santa Elena.
   Here they found the gringo
   Dead with another dozen.
   For that satanic gang
   Black will be their sentence.''

   A U.S. immigration official says he was acting
out of compassion when he led a prayer that Ferdinand Marcos be
allowed to return to the Philippines.
   Harold Ezell said Monday he led the prayer during an Aug. 3
party where he also danced with Marcos' wife, Imelda, because the
deposed Philippine president had expressed a desire to return home
to bury his mother.
   ``It has nothing to do with U.S. policy. It has something to do
with a human being who has feelings as I have,'' said Ezell,
western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Ezell said he now regrets attending the party at Marcos' mansion
overlooking Honolulu, but doesn't regret offering the prayer.
   ``I think I can express my personal views,'' said Ezell. He said
his father, a minister, also had died a year earlier and he
sympathized with Marcos about the death of the ousted Philippines
president's mother.
   ``If it's wrong to pray for a person, I'll take the heat for
that,'' Ezell said.
   Ezell, answering questions following a news conference to
promote the agency's amnesty program, also said he didn't think
there was anything wrong with asking immigration officials from
several western states to join him in the prayer during the party.
   ``Americans are free to do what they want,'' Ezell said. ``They
don't have to join in. I'm not the commander or dictator of the
immigration service.''
   A videotape obtained by The Honolulu Advertiser shows Ezell
embracing Marcos and dancing with Marcos' wife while Ezell's wife
danced with the former president. The newspaper did not reveal the
source of the videotape.
   ``Eat your heart out,'' Ezell called out as he danced with Mrs.
Marcos to the beat of ``Don't Throw My Love Away.''
   Ezell noted that the party was held before a New York grand jury
indicted the Marcoses on racketeering charges in October. They are
accused of looting more than $100 million from the Philippines to
buy art and real estate in New York.
   The commissioner said too much was being made of the immigration
officials attending the event.
   ``To me it's ridiculous, it's a social event,'' Ezell said.
``But if I had to do it over again, I would not.''
   U.S. policy since Marcos fled to exile in Hawaii in 1986 has
been to support Philippine President Corazon Aquino's repeated
refusals to allow Marcos return home. Mrs. Aquino has cited
national security in denying his requests.

   George Bush outlined his anti-crime package in
a setting reminiscent of his presidential campaign, but the
president sounded very different from the candidate on gun control
and he never mentioned prison furloughs.
   Once again, when confronted with the realities and conflicting
pressures of governing, Bush opted for compromise.
   His speech Monday from the steps of the U.S. Capitol included
echoes from his campaign, including his call for greater use of the
death penalty, tougher sentencing and increased prison construction.
   But on the touchy question of gun control, he sounded far
different.
   His calls for a ban on large-capacity cartridge magazines and
for import restrictions on assault-style weapons were welcomed by
gun control advocates. But while taking that action, the president
declined to move against assault-style rifles manufactured
domestically.
   A month ago, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggested _
and it was nothing more than a suggestion _ that a ban on
domestically manufactured assault-style rifles could be part of the
Bush crime package.
   The press secretary said was there was ``some unfairness''
because the ban on imported weapons would have no impact on sales
of U.S. made rapid-fire rifles.
   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''
said Fitzwater. ``To do anything about domestically manufactured
weapons would require a change in the law.''
   That change was never requested.
   What Bush did request was a prohibition on manufacture and sale
of magazines that carry more than 15 cartridges, a position that
puts him on the same side as Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio.
   But Metzenbaum also wants to ban sales of new assault-style
weapons made in the United States. The Ohio senator argues that
limiting imports only deals with about 25 percent of the weapons.
   The day that Bush delivered his speech, the National Rifle
Association ran a full-page ad that attacked Metzenbaum's bill.
   ``Do you honestly believe that banning some, or even all,
semiautos will stop drug dealers, street gangs or any violent
criminals from getting any gun illegally?'' asked the NRA ad.
   Some anti-crime proposals such as mandatory gun-related
sentencing have a wide range of support.
   The NRA ad suggested alternatives that were identical to some of
Bush's key proposals, including barring plea bargaining for any
felony committed with a gun, mandatory sentencing for crimes
committed with a gun, and increased prison construction.
   Metzenbaum also supports a 10-year mandatory sentence and more
money for new prisons.
   But there was a distinct difference in tone between the speech
Bush gave to the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and his
campaign rhetoric.
   His audience on a rainy Monday included relatives of the 161
police killed in the line of duty last year. As he did so often
during his campaign, Bush recalled how he had been given the badge
of 22-year-old Eddie Byrne, a New York police officer killed by
what the president called ``a gang of cocaine cowards.''
   But during the campaign, Bush took a no-compromise position on
gun control.
   ``My opponent favors gun control and I do not,'' he said in
speech after speech. ``I don't believe in new restrictions on the
rights of citizens to own arms.''
   As a president faced with a growing wave of drug-related
violence, Bush is inching away from that hard line.
   ``The right to own a gun is not a license to harm others,'' he
said Monday, using language unlike any he uttered during the
campaign.
   When he was attacking the Massachusetts prison furlough program
last year, Bush aides assured reporters that as president he would
order a review of the federal prison furlough program.
   A source in the Bureau of Prisons said no general review of the
federal program has been done although wardens have been instructed
to take a harder look at prisoners before they are granted
furloughs.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
today, and the dollar continued rising against the yen despite
central bank intervention in support of the Japanese currency.
   The dollar closed at 137.00 yen, up 0.20 yen from Monday's
136.80-yen close. It opened at an 18-month high of 137.30 yen and
ranged between 136.95 yen and 137.65 yen.
   The dollar has gained 2.56 yen over the past four trading days.
   The Bank of Japan sold between $400 million and $500 million
during the morning session to check the dollar's increase, traders
said. The Bank of Japan does not comment publicly on its market
intervention.
   Ichiro Ikeda, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said the
dollar's downward trend in the afternoon, however, was the result
of profit-taking, and not of central bank intervention.
   ``Having bought all those dollars, a majority of participants
seemed to start collecting profits,'' Ikeda said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues
rebounded to 33,926.45, regaining 210.16 points, or 0.62 percent.
It had lost 150.04 points Monday.
   New Japan Securities dealer Kazuhiro Murata attributed the
index's sharp rise in the afternoon session to strong performances
by hi-tech issues.
   ``Investors turned their interest to hi-tech issues, trying to
take advantage of the yen's recent weakness against the dollar,''
he said. The lower yen helps exports.
   Another dealer at a Japanese brokerage, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said institutional investors remained on the sidelines
because of concern over possible interest rate hikes and continuing
political uncertainty.
   Market sources have been speculating that the dollar's sharp
rise against the yen could lead to higher interest rates in Japan.
   Meanwhile, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has not been
able to find a successor for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who
has announced he is resigning to take responsibility for an
influence-peddling scandal.
   The yen's weakness on the foreign exchange market also
discouraged stock investors, the dealer said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, up from Monday's 400 million.

<HEAD>Two Sailors Died of Asphyxiation, Navy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two sailors killed in a fire aboard the
aircraft carrier USS America died of asphyxiation, the Navy said.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard E. Childress, 22, of Ham Lake,
Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J. Brunson, 19, of Akron, Ohio,
were on watch in a jet fuel pump room when the fire broke out
Saturday evening as the ship was cruising several hundred miles off
North Carolina.
   ``They sounded the alarm and were evacuating the space when they
were overcome by fumes and noxious gas,'' Lt. Cmdr. Michael John, a
Navy spokesman, said Monday night.
   Both were asphyxiated, John said.
   A team of Navy investigators on Monday flew from Norfolk Naval
Air Station to the carrier, said John.
   In addition to seeking a cause of the fire, the team will assess
the damage to determine how and where the ship will be repaired, he
said.
   John said a shipboard memorial service was held for the two
sailors. Their bodies were returned to Norfolk on Sunday.
   The 1,047-foot carrier, which left here Thursday with a crew of
about 5,000, continued toward the Mediterranean Sea for a six-month
tour of duty.
   Childress' stepfather, Timothy Holleman, said Sunday that Navy
officials told him that Childress and Brunson apparently noticed a
fuel leak while working the fire watch in a pump room. The carrier
contains miles of pipes through which jet fuel circulates.
   Childress apparently notified the bridge of the problem and was
returning to the room when an explosion occurred, Holleman said.
Officials told the family that Brunson might have died in the
explosion and that Childress might have died going back into the
room, possibly to look for Brunson, Holleman said.
   The fire was the third fatal blaze aboard a Navy ship in less
than a month. Before last month, the Navy had had three fatal
shipboard fires in the last five years, said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy
spokesman in Washington.
   An Apri1 19 explosion and fire in a gun turret on the battleship
USS Iowa killed 47 sailors while the ship was off Puerto Rico. On
May 9, six sailors died in an engine room fire on the supply ship
USS White Plains in the South China Sea.
   John said there is no evidence linking the three fires, and the
Navy said it had made no changes because of the blazes.
   ``We place great emphasis on safety and on training on a daily
basis in every ship,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a
spokesman in Washington.

<HEAD>Seoul Criticizes Washington As Meddling In Its Internal Affairs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government warned Washington today
not to comment on its internal affairs and said remarks by a U.S.
official on the mysterious death of a radical student could harm
relations.
   The warning came as the Seoul government put riot police on
nationwide alert to prepare for possible protests this week over
the student's death and the ninth anniversary of a bloody 1980
anti-government uprising.
   About 300 radical students calling for the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police with firebombs and rocks
at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. Troopers with interlocked
shields blocked the school's main gate to stop students from
marching into the streets.
   A Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be named in keeping
with official practice, said a U.S. State Department official's
comments on the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu were
unacceptable and incorrect.
   ``Unnecessary (American) comment on internal matters,
particularly on a situation in which it does not know the truth,
would not be of help to the U.S.-Korea alliance or friendly
relations,'' the official said.
   South Korean dissidents claim Lee was tortured and killed by
police and reject a government autopsy report that he drowned. The
body was found May 10 in a reservoir outside the southeastern city
of Kwangju.
   South Korea protested to Washington after the State Department
official last week called Lee's death ``a deplorable event. We do
not know who may have committed this atrocious act.''
   The official noted that Roh had called for a full investigation
of the case ``and we hope the murderers will be exposed and
severely punished.''
   South Korea lodged a protest in Washington over the statement,
contending it had not been proved that Lee was murdered. The State
Department said Monday it did not intend to prejudge how Lee was
killed.
   The Foreign Ministry said today that it accepted the State
Department's Monday comment as ``a practical correction'' of the
reference to ``murderers'' even though it was not specifically
retracted by the department.
   South Korea and the United States are close allies and about
43,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual defense
treaty.
   Thousands of people have held daily protests in Kwangju to
denounce police as being responsible for Lee's death. Clashes have
broken out between protesters trying to march to provincial
government headquarters and truncheon-wielding troopers.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests and labor
strikes in recent months. Dissident groups are caling for the
overthrow of Roh, but they lack public support because of their
violent tactics and extreme views.
   Dissidents and radical students are trying to harness the
growing furor over Lee's death to step up a campaign to topple the
government. Dissidents call for the expulsion of U.S. forces.
   Authorities fear the dispute over Lee's death could inflame
protests this week to mark the anniversary of a 1980 uprising in
Kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed. Dissidents have
called for nationwide demonstrations.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said riot police had been
placed on nationwide alert to prevent violent protests. Security
was being increased at government buildings to prevent possible
student attacks, officials said.
   The opposition-controlled National Assembly convened 16
committees today to investigate Lee's death, the Kwangju uprising
and other issues. Opposition parties contend the government is
using radical violence as a pretext to crack down on all opposition
groups.
   President Roh said today that the government was making every
effort to find out how Lee died. He said the dissidents' efforts to
play up the incident were a threat to political stability and
democracy.
   At the time of Lee's deasth, police had been hting for him
because of his anti-government activities, including writing
articles praising communist North Korea. Authorities say police
stopped Lee in a taxi near Kwangju, but he escaped on foot.
   Police officials say Lee probably fell into the reservoir while
fleeing police and drowned.
   Dissident groups claim the government investigation into Lee's
death was a coverup and are demanding an independent probe by
Amnesty International or the World Christian Council.

   Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev worked the crowds in
Beijing today but stayed clear of much larger crowds of student
demonstrators.
   The Soviet leader, on his way back to the state guest house
after lunch with China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping, stopped his
car and got out to shake hands with pedestrians, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The people shouted ``Welcome, welcome'' and cheered when
Gorbachev announced that Sino-Soviet relations, strained for three
decades, had been normalized with his visit.
   ``Gorbachev told the masses that the Soviet and Chinese peoples
enjoy a very good friendship,'' Xinhua said.
   It said Mrs. Gorbachev signed a card handed to her by a Chinese
woman and posed for pictures.
   Mrs. Gorbachev earlier toured the national library with Zhu Lin,
the wife of Premier Li Peng. She, too, walked into a crowd of
spectators upon her arrival and greeted them with handshakes and
hellos in Chinese.
   The Gorbachevs did not, however, follow the lead of President
Bush, who during a February visit staged his encounter with the
people in the photogenic setting of Tiananmen Square, outside the
entrance of the Forbidden City.
   The square has been occupied since Saturday by tens of thousands
of students and supporters clamoring for democratic reform.
   The students, who admire Gorbachev's policy of glasnost or
openness, have asked for a meeting with the Soviet leader and urged
him to take up their case with China's leaders.
   Gorbachev's itinerary, however, has been substantially altered
to keep him out of range of the rebellious students.

   Americans are softening their view of the Soviet
Union as a military threat but half still believe Moscow seeks
world domination, according to a poll published today.
   The New York Times-CBS News Poll found that the number of people
who believe the Soviet threat ``is constantly growing and presents
a real, immediate danger to the United States'' dropped to 26
percent, from 64 percent in 1983, two years before Mikhail S.
Gorbachev took power.
   In addition, the number who think Gorbachev is a radical
departure from his predecessors grew from 47 percent in his first
year to 65 percent in 1987 and 79 percent now.
   However, the poll said 50 percent believe the Soviet Union seeks
world domination and 57 percent said Moscow would start a war to
get something it wanted.
   The poll also found Americans are less interested in China than
in the Soviet Union and generally believe the Chinese are less
aggressive than the Soviets.
   Of the 1,073 people questioned, 30 percent had favorable
opinions toward the Soviet Union, 24 percent had unfavorable
opinions and 43 percent were neutral. The poll said that represents
a doubling of positive sentiment toward the Soviet Union since 1987.
   The poll, taken from May 9 to May 11, also found two-thirds like
the Soviet Union's proposal to negotiate about the elimination of
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Weapons Charges Dropped; Government Misconduct Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURANGO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who dismissed weapons charges
against a lawyer arrested as part of an undercover drug
investigation said law enforcement officials may have committed
perjury in the case.
   The false charges were filed in La Plata County Court here
against an undercover deputy to give the officer a reason to hire
lawyer Robin Auld to defend him, District Court Judge Richard Brown
said Monday.
   ``This court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctions
the filing of false and perjured documents in an official court
proceeding as part of an undercover operation,'' Brown wrote.
   The government plan had called for the undercover officer to pay
Auld in drugs for his legal services, and then pressure Auld to
``set up'' drug traffickers in southwest Colorado, according to
testimony in previous hearings.
   Auld, 43, refused to accept drugs but later took possession of
an Uzi machine gun, according to testimony. The prosecution charged
he took the gun as payment; Auld contended he kept it as collateral.
   The gun belonged to the Durango Police Department on loan from
the FBI, according to court documents.
   Auld's trial was to have started May 22 in Durango.
   Brown, a visiting judge who heard the case after 6th Judicial
District judges in Durango disqualified themselves, said, ``The
public has a right to demand and to expect that the courts will do
their utmost to remain impartial and to promote the public's
confidence in the integrity of the courts.''
   Filing the false affidavits was ``an impermissible taint upon
the integrity and impartiality of the courts,'' he wrote.
   Auld said he was ``very happy'' with the ruling, but did not
want to comment because the decision might be appealed.
   ``It takes guts, but it's the right thing. He (Brown) wouldn't
put up with the corruption of court records,'' said Hal Haddon,
Auld's lawyer.
   A notice of claim seeking at least $1 million in civil damages
on Auld's behalf has been filed, but the attorney has not brought a
formal lawsuit.
   Keith Cross, the special prosecutor in the case, said he will
appeal.
   ``If this decision stands, it means the attorney never has to
face a jury on fairly serious charges,'' Cross said.
   Cross said he considered the false affidavits before he filed
the charges of theft by receiving and possession of a dangerous
weapon against Auld.
   ``In my opinion, there were no indictable offenses committed by
the DA or law enforcement officials,'' Cross said. ``There is no
question that two documents filed and sworn to weren't true, but I
believe there is a difference in doing that and taking the stand
and perjuring themselves.''

   A jogger who was raped and beaten by a gang of
youths in Central Park has taken her first, shaky steps since last
month's attack and can now write her name, a doctor said.
   But Dr. Robert S. Kurtz added that it remains unclear how much
she will recover.
   ``The more small neurologic improvements are registered, the
more clearly apparent it becomes how great a distance she has yet
to travel,'' said Kurtz, director of the surgical intensive care
unit at Metropolitan Hospital.
   ``She is now able to take a few walking steps although her gait
is still broad-based and unsteady,'' he said Monday.
   The woman also can now write her name in a shaky hand, the
doctor said.
   The 28-year-old woman, an investment banker, was accosted April
19 as she took her nightly jog. Six teen-agers have been indicted
in the assault.
   Doctors say the woman, who was in a coma for nearly two weeks,
suffered brain damage from the beating and from a lack of oxygen as
she lay unconscious for several hours.
   ``Neurologically, the patient is better oriented to her
surroundings,'' Kurtz said. But, he added, she is ``still not fully
oriented to time and place.''
   During the weekend, the woman twice developed fevers of 101.5
degrees, which Kurtz said may stem from infections and from
inflammation of an arm vein used for intravenous treatment.
   If the infections don't clear up, Kurtz said surgery scheduled
for Wednesday to repair facial bones may be postponed.

   Down at the landmark Tweed Courthouse, city
officials posted plastic owls to try to scare away the
peril-dropping pigeons. But it isn't working.
   ``The owls are turning into pussycats,'' said Ed Barbini, a
spokesman for the General Services Department.
   The exterior of the marble building behind City Hall is in the
throes of renovation. In December, officials strung up a dozen
18-inch-high plastic owls, hoping they would keep away the pigeons
whose droppings contain a natural acid that harms stone.
   They even moved the bogus birds around for the sake of realism.
   But it didn't work for long. These are street-wise pigeons.
   ``They're basically stupid animals, but not that stupid,'' said
Mike Feller, chief naturalist for the Parks Department.
   When the $20 million renovation is done, the city plans more
permanent and proven measures to keep the pigeons from perching on
the courthouse ledges.
   Birds get a mild shock, for example, when they run across City
Hall, thanks to low-voltage wiring. And at Brooklyn Borough Hall,
the inviting bronze statue of Justice atop a cupola becomes less
attractive when a pigeon-troubling ultrasound device disturbs the
sound waves.

<HEAD>Tired, Weatherbeaten Explorers Head Home After North Pole Trek</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RESOLUTE, Northwest Territories (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight explorers who
trekked 620 miles to the North Pole to draw attention to humanity's
assault on the fragile Arctic environment began their journey home
looking haggard but happy.
   The team on Monday flew to Eureka and then to their base camp in
Resolute Monday night.
   The explorers _ from Britain, Canada, the United States, the
Soviet Union, Japan, Australia and West Germany _ reached the North
Pole on Sunday and planted a U.N. flag. They were to fly to Ottawa
today.
   With their uncut hair and sunburned faces, the team members
appeared haggard and exhausted on Monday night.
   Expedition leader Robert Swan of Britain told a news conference
that he hoped the trek, called Icewalk, achieved its goal of
bringing attention to the environment and would spur politicians to
do more to protect nature.
   ``We've got to work together as one world to take on the
environment,'' said Swan, who became the first person to walk to
the North Pole and South Pole. He had reached the South Pole in
1986.
   The adventurers, who walked and skied, said temperatures were as
low as 67 degrees below zero during the 56-day trek.
   All suffered some health problems, from frostbite to influenza,
but the American, Darryl Roberts, 23, of New York, suffered the
worst.
   Severe frostbite on his feet made him limp much of the time, but
he never thought of quitting, said Roberts, the first American to
walk to the North Pole.
   ``With the moral support of the other team members, I knew I was
going to be able to make it,'' he said.
   The adventurers left Cape Aldrich on Ellesmere Island in
Canada's Northwest Territories on March 20.
   They made their journey in an effort to spur political action on
halting pollution and slowing down global warming _ the so-called
Greenhouse effect _ which is produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels.
   Icewalk had a high-power public relations operation promoting it
and corporate sponsorship supporting its $4 million budget.
   It differed from other Arctic expeditions because participants
used only human power to travel and take supplies along in sledges
that each carry about 250 pounds of cargo.

<HEAD>U.S. Says It Can't Afford Wheelchair Lifts On All New Buses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation cannot afford the $90 million
annual cost of requiring transit systems to equip new buses with
wheelchair lifts, a Bush administration lawyer told a federal
appeals court.
   Instead, communities should stick with the current system of
balancing special services for the disabled against the costs of
those services, U.S. Department of Transportation attorney Jeffrey
Clair told the 3rd Circuit of Appeals on Monday.
   The case has attracted the attention of dozens of
disabled-rights groups, many angered by the government's decision
to ask the full appeals court to review a Feb. 13 decision by a
three-judge panel.
   In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said the Department of
Transportation failed to provide the disabled equal accessibility
as intended by Congress.
   The panel struck down regulations that transit systems need
spend no more than 3 percent of their average annual operating
costs on measures for the disabled, so long as the government
approves. It also disallowed a provision allowing communities to
meet obligations by providing special vans that must be reserved in
advance.
   Before Monday's hearing, building security officials helped
wheel 13 disabled spectators into the courtroom. Some observers
wore hats reminiscent of the Revolutionary War era.
   ``This is the case that will mean independence for disabled
people,'' said Stephen Gold, attorney for Americans Disabled for
Accessible Public Transportation, or ADAPT, which filed the lawsuit
the government is appealing.
   Clair said requiring lifts on all new buses would be too rigid
and ``overly burdensome.'' He said lifts on 50 percent of buses was
more acceptable.
   He recited a quip attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen:
``A billion here and a billion there, pretty soon you're talking
about real money.''
   Clair botched the quote, substituting millions for billions, and
was corrected by one of the judges. But he said the idea was an
approach ``that allows communities to respond with a program
tailored to local needs.''
   A wheelchair lift costs $10,000 to $15,000, while a bus costs up
to $200,000. In its petition, the government said transit agencies
across the country would pay a total of $90 million annually for
the lifts.
   ADAPT merely wants the court to require lifts on new buses,
meaning entire fleets probably will not be accessible until the
year 2001, said Timothy Cook, an ADAPT lawyer.
   Cook argued that van service denies the handicapped spontaneous
use of mass transit by requiring the disabled to make reservations
up to 24 hours in advance.
   ``Don't perpetuate forever a clearly inferior system because
that would be contrary to the rule of Congress,'' Cook said.

   The dollar fell in moderate European trading this
morning. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign currency dealers said the drop on the heels of Monday's
surge was the result of profit-taking and consolidation. European
markets, except Britain's and Italy's, were closed Monday for the
Pentecost holiday.
   Traders said they expect positive dollar-buying sentiment to
push the dollar higher unless there is some decisive action taken
by central banks.
   ``The trend is still very strongly upward,'' said a trader in
Milan, Italy. ``Fundamentally, nothing has changed, but there's a
bit of a reflective pause.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day beings,
the dollar closed up 0.20 yen at 137.00 yen, despite reported
intervention by the Bank of Japan. The dollar has gained 2.56 yen
over the last four trading days.
   Later in London, the dollar traded at 136.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.9366 West German marks, down from 1.9415
   _1.7330 Swiss francs, down from 1.7438
   _6.5465 French francs, down from 6.5725
   _2.1839 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1905
   _1,408.50 Italian lire, down from 1,411.00.
   _1.1876 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1905.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6455, more expensive for
buyers than $1.6385 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $374.55, up from $374.00
late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $374.40.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at a bid 374.40 dollars, down from
379.25 late Friday. Bullion markets were closed in Switzerland on
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 69 cents an ounce to close at
$375.99.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.51 a troy
ounce, down from $5.53 late Monday.

and the Appalachians this morning.
   Severe storms hit Texas Monday evening, with tornadoes sighted
near Wildorado and Hereford in the northwest part of the state.
There were no reports of damage or injuries.
   Thunderstorms also dropped golf ball-size hail in northwest
Texas and nickel-size hail in southern Oklahoma, while hail the
size of goose eggs broke windows in homes around Endee, N.M.
   Powerful storms also hit parts of the central and northern
Plains, hitting Cody, Wyo., with dime-size hail and generating 60
mph wind gusts near Goodland, Kan.
   Showers and thunderstorms this morning covered much of northern
Texas, southern Oklahoma and southwestern Arkansas, as well as from
western Kansas to eastern Wyoming.
   Low pressure off the middle Atlantic Coast continued to produce
showers and thunderstorms from North Carolina to the lower Great
Lakes.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, although
fog was developing in South Carolina, West Virginia and Upper
Michigan.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern Mississippi across Louisiana to much of Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, western Nebraska, and western South Dakota. Thunderstorms
may be severe in the southern Plains. Showers and thunderstorms
were forecast across much of the Rocky Mountains and parts of Utah,
Nevada and Idaho. Showers were predicted from Virginia to the lower
Great Lakes and northern Atlantic Coast states.
   Highs were expected to be in the 50s and 60s from New England to
the lower Great Lakes and the mid-Atlantic states, and from Montana
across Colorado and northern Arizona, eastern Nevada, much of Idaho
and Washington, and the southern coast of California; the 80s in
Florida, from western Georgia across western Tennessee, much of the
Mississippi Valley, eastern Oklahoma and much of Texas; and the 70s
elsewhere.

   Helen Suzman, considered the
country's most steadfast anti-apartheid politician, announced today
that she will retire in September after 36 years in Parliament.
   Mrs. Suzman, 71, is the longest-serving member of Parliament,
having represented the same Johannesburg constituency since 1953.
   From 1961 through 1974, she was the only legislator representing
the anti-apartheid opposition and often cast the sole vote against
discriminatory or repressive laws.
   She announced she would not seek re-election on Sept. 6, when a
general election will be held for the white, Asian and mixed-race
chambers of Parliament. She has campaigned consistently to extend
political rights to the black majority, which has no representation
in Parliament.
   Mrs. Suzman has represented four liberal parties, the first
three of which either merged with or were replaced by another.
Starting in 1959, she represented the Progressive Party, which
later was broadened and renamed the Progressive Federal Party.
   In April, that party joined with two other anti-apartheid
factions to form the Democratic Party.
   Harry Oppenheimer, the industrialist who has helped finance
anti-apartheid political parties, wrote of Mrs. Suzman last year:
``Our hope and our faith owe more than any of us can say to the
career, the personality and the example of Helen Suzman.
   ``For 14 lonely years as the sole Progressive in Parliament, she
kept alive a proper respect for human dignity, a deep sympathy for
human suffering, and a hatred of all cruelty and injustice.''
   Probably more so than any other white elected official, Mrs.
Suzman won the trust and good will of black activists. She attended
funerals of slain militants, traveled frequently to black townships
and in 1987 finished ninth in a poll asking black newspaper readers
who they would like to see as president.
   She also has met several times with imprisoned black nationalist
leader Nelson Mandela and repeatedly has called for his release.
   In 1985-86, at the height of political unrest in black
townships, Mrs. Suzman refused to join militant anti-apartheid
leaders in calling for punitive economic sanctions aganst South
Africa. She said such measures would make whites more resistant to
change and prevent blacks from making economic gains that would
help them acquire political leverage.
   ``I absolutely understand the moral outrage against apartheid. I
share it,'' she said in 1987. ``But I cannot support the practical
results of this policy (of sanctions).''
   She received the United Nations Award of the International
League for Human rights in 1978, and has twice been nominated for
the Nobel Peace Prize.

   The Duke in lipstick?
   That's the way John Wayne was depicted on a greeting card,
wearing a cowboy hat and bright, red lips. The message inside was
about being homosexual.
   ``We find it repugnant,'' said Michael Wayne, the oldest of John
Wayne's seven children.
   Wayne is one of a host of relatives of dead celebrities who want
the state of New York to give them exclusive rights to the names
and images of famous family members. The relatives testified Monday
at a legislative hearing.
   A proposal before the Legislature would require the commercial
media, artists and others who want to use the dead celebrity's
persona to get permission. It would be up to the relative to decide
how much the user would have to pay.
   The exclusive rights would last 50 years after the celebrity's
death. Violations would be a misdemeanor.
   Nine other states, including California, have such laws. But in
the nation's publishing and media center, Madison Avenue has free
rein when it comes to using dead celebrities as pitchmen.
   ``The public that admired him has a right to have his public
image protected, and who better to protect it than his family?''
Wayne said of his Oscar-winning father.
   ``It's not fair that just anybody can walk up and take your
relative's name and twist it around and do any kind of thing they
want to do,'' added Ilsis Nicole Holiday, sister of jazz singer
Billie Holiday.
   Holiday objected to what she considered a false portrayal of her
sister in the Diana Ross movie ``Lady Sings the Blues.''
   Also at the hearing were Robyn Astaire, Fred Astaire's widow;
Julia Ruth Stevens, daughter of Babe Ruth, and Everett Fields,
grandson of W.C. Fields. They brought out books, posters and
trinkets that contained their relatives' images.
   Opponents of the proposal argued that it would impinge on First
Amendment rights to free expression. One opponent charged that
celebrity relatives were out to do some exploitation of their own.
   ``The wrong that these bills appear to redress is that the heirs
of celebrities evidently do not feel that they are getting enough
money for the use of the persona of their famous ancestors,'' said
Jerome Wilson, lawyer for Time Inc. and the Magazine Publishers of
America.
   ``It is not enough that they inherit the celebrity's mansion,
the bank account and whatever copyright and trademark benefits that
may have been devised.''
   Wilson added: ``The dead don't have blood and bones. They're
dead. They're dust. That's why they don't have this kind of right.''

<HEAD>The 1980s: Maybe The Worst Since The 1930s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unless the 1989 economy grows more than twice as
fast as now appears likely, the decade of the 1980s will be the
worst for economic growth since the 1930s.
   That startling observation seems to contradict what almost every
American knows _ so oft is it repeated _ that in the 1980s we have
achieved what is said to be the longest peacetime expansion of the
century.
   The statements don't conflict. The expansion, now in its 77th
month, may be unmatched in persistence but not in accomplishment,
because so far in the 1980s the U.S. economy has grown at an annual
average of just 2.5 percent.
   That message was delivered recently to the Hartford Society of
Financial Analysts by John Winthrop Wright, whose approach to
investing might be called classical or fundamental but who in these
odd times finds himself a contrarian.
   An economic or investment contrarian is one who sees things
differently, and who seeks to use that different perspective to
protect himself from the madness of the popular mind, such as in
extolling the great expansion.
   A tenet of Wright's philosophy, and of the company he founded,
Wright Investors' Service, Bridgeport, Conn., is to take the long
perspective lest you be swept into the latest fad or phobia and
thereby lose your perspective.
   That is why he suggests we take a decade-long look at the
economy rather than lose our minds to the latest figures. He
suggests that 77 straight monthly gains in gross national product
figures may have created a false impression.
   It is true, he said, that the 1982 recession depressed the
decade's figures, and that since that time the economy has grown at
a 4 percent rate. But so what? How many decades have escaped a
recession? None.
   Of course, Wright continuued, the 1970s weren't that great
either. After 30 years of economic growth averaging more than 4
percent a year, the country has been growing at just around 2.5
percent a year for nearly 20 years.
   Furthermore, he said, ``we've had to work harder to get what
meager growth we've gotten.'' That is, the country has had to put a
greater proportion of its population to work in order to maintain
standards to which we're accustomed.
   For example, two of every three civilians are now in the labor
force, and a record 63 percent of civilians are working, up from 59
percent at the beginning of the decade. Most households have
multiple breadwinners now.
   In other words, said Wright, real gross national product and per
capita GNP have remained close to the trendline growth in recent
years only as a result of putting an increasing percentage of the
population to work.
   Real GNP per worker is still below the long-term trend line. In
real terms, with inflation wrung out, hourly earnings are no higher
than they were 15 years ago.
   Little wonder, said Wright, that like the Red Queen from ``Alice
in Wonderland,'' many families feel as if they have to run faster
just to stay in place.
   Wright's purpose in describing his perspective was not to
disparage the accomplishments of those who helped keep the economy
exapnding, but to ask a few questions about the manner in which it
is now being led.
   Specifically, why has the Federal Reserve pushed up interest
rates?
   ``Our view,'' he said, ``is that the underlying trend of
inflation is still under good control and that inflation is
probably now close to its peak rate for the current business
cycle.''
   We should be reminded, he said, that the United States has a
long history of moderate inflation, averaging just over 3 percent
for the 20th century to date. It is always around, if not as a
reality then as a threat.
   ``Slowing the U.S. economy when it is hardly booming seems a
strange way to deal with inflation caused by bad weather and the
higher cost of both domestic capital and imported products,'' he
said.
   Sooner or later, he concluded, the Federal Reserve will ``see
the error of its ways in trying to beat down the entire economy in
order to offset price pressures which are beyond its control.''

   A veteran sheriff's deputy once accused of
killing three prostitutes walked out of jail with charges dropped
after additional tests showed that a gun found in his car was not
used in the killings.
   Rickey Ross, 40, broke into tears Monday and repeatedly said
``Praise the Lord!'' and ``Thank God!'' when told of his impending
release, according to Don Ingwersen, Ross' court-appointed
investigator.
   But the 18-year sheriff's veteran remains a suspect in the case
because of other evidence uncovered during the investigation, said
Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman.
   ``We don't want to exclude Mr. Ross until we investigate all
possibilities,'' Hodgman said. ``It may well result that we can
dismiss him as a suspect in time. At the moment, we can't say
that.''
   However, Hodgman said of the ballistics tests, I think we can in
all honesty say that is not the gun.''
   Ross, of Rialto, was arrested Feb. 23 during a routine traffic
stop in the crime-ridden South Central Los Angeles area. He
allegedly was seated next to a prostitute, and a 9mm semiautomatic
pistol was found in the trunk.
   Authorities charged Ross with three counts of murder Feb. 27
after Police Department ballistics tests were said to have linked
the gun to the killings of three prostitutes.
   Ross' family and attorney strongly denied his guilt. On
Saturday, Ross released a statement from jail, saying, ``I have
never killed anyone'' and contending he had witnesses to vouch for
his whereabouts during the killings.
   He said he had put the gun _ his former service weapon _ in his
trunk because it was water damaged and rusted.
   ``By LAPD's own admission,'' Ross said, ``the gun had to be
forced open to be test-fired.''
   On Monday, authorities announced that two subsequent ballistics
tests conducted outside the Police Department found that the slugs
that killed the women were fired from the same kind of gun, but not
the weapon found in Ross' car.
   Municipal Court Judge Elva Soper agreed to dismiss the charges,
which could have brought the death penalty if Ross were convicted.
   Ross joined his wife at an undisclosed location after his
release from jail.
   Ross was dismissed from the Sheriff's Department after his
arrest. Sheriff's officials declined to say Monday if he would be
allowed to return to his job.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 3rd graf, The proposal, to add fresh quotes

<TEXT>
   President Bush's anti-crime proposals place
him in a crossfire between gun lobbyists who say he went too far
and lawmakers who say his plans won't stop the shooting on
America's streets.
   The skirmishing erupted Monday after the president unveiled
plans for a permanent ban on imports of many semiautomatic assault
weapons and a ban on the manufacture of ammunition magazines for
those guns containing more than 15 rounds.
   The proposal is part of a $1.2 billion anti-crime package that
also calls for building new prisons, hiring more federal agents,
widening the death penalty and toughening sentences for illegally
using semiautomatic guns.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh defended the program today on
``CBS This Morning,'' saying, ``I think it represents a very
important tangible commitment to law enforcement. The war on crime
is no longer rhetorical ... In the street language, if you can't do
the time, don't do the crime.''
   ``There'll be a systemwide approach,'' Thornburgh said. ``That
means more agents to investigate crimes, more prosecutors to
prosecute them, and most importantly, the jails to accommodate
those who have been convicted of serious violent crimes.''
   The National Rifle Association of America, the nation's largest
gun lobby, fired one of the first volleys at the president's
gun-control plan.
   ``We don't see a heck of a difference between a 15-round
magazine and three five-round magazines other than about the two
seconds it takes to change from one to another,'' said James Baker,
the NRA's chief lobbyist in Washington. ``That's not going to have
an effect on criminals.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, sponsor of broader restrictions
on semiautomatic weapons, said he was ``disappointed that the
president chose to limit his action'' to foreign-made guns, which
account for only about 25 percent of U.S. sales.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, also questioned why Bush did not propose to
restrict domestically manufactured military-style assault weapons.
   ``If it makes sense to ban the importation of assault weapons,
why doesn't it make sense to ban similar weapons made here in the
United States?'' Biden asked.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Bush's assault-weapon proposals
``don't do enough to protect police officers who are going against
these weapons in urban battle zones.''
   Meanwhile, the head of a gun-owners group angrily denounced the
proposal as a ``back-door attempt to ban handguns in the name of
curing the assault rifle problem.''
   ``If George Bush thinks that American gun owners and other
clear-thinking Americans will accept this public relations stunt
and drop the pressure on him, the president is sadly mistaken,''
said Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.
   The 15-round limit on ammunition magazines would also apply to
semiautomatic handguns, many of which are made overseas, said a
Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The proposal comes amid studies showing that semiautomatic
rifles are being used more often in the commission of crimes.
Public furor erupted in January after five children were killed in
a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunman using a Soviet-style
AK-47 assault rifle.
   Speaking in the rain outside the U.S. Capitol to relatives of
161 police officers killed last year, Bush vowed to ``take back the
streets'' from violent criminals with tougher enforcement and
stiffer penalties.
   Bush said he would make permanent his two-month-old temporary
ban on importing semiautomatic assault weapons that are not used
for sporting purposes.
   Bush said that most guns are ``legitimately owned for legitimate
purposes,'' but that ``the right to own guns is not a license to
harm others.''
   ``There is substantial controversy and debate,'' Bush said.
``But one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is that
they invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines,''
he said, explaining his proposal to limit magazines to 15 rounds.
   Bush also proposed doubling the mandatory sentence for using a
semiautomatic firearm during commission of a violent crime or drug
felony, from five to 10 years.
   The president's plan also would revive the death penalty for
espionage, treason and a wide range of murders by amending existing
federal laws to conform to Supreme Court standards for capital
punishment.
   Besides reviving those death penalty provisions that have fallen
into disuse since high-court rulings of the 1970s, the proposal
would provide capital punishment for a number of other murders,
including killings committed for hire, homicides by federal
prisoners serving life sentences and by terrorists.
   The president also sought an extra $1 billion to build an extra
24,000 beds in the nation's federal prison system, which now holds
48,000 inmates.
   The plan also calls for spending an additional $50.3 million to
hire 825 federal agents at the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and the U.S. Marshals Service.
   Another $49.6 million would be spent to hire an additional 1,600
federal prosecutors.
   Civil libertarians are likely to oppose Bush's other proposals
to limit access to the federal courts for state prisoners
challenging criminal convictions, and for a ``good-faith''
exception to the rule that excludes improperly seized evidence from
court.

   Fifty-five students protesting racism on
the Stanford University campus were arrested following a takeover
of the president's office.
   Meanwhile, at Michigan State University in East Lansing, a
sit-in at the school's administration building by black students
entered its eighth day today.
   MSU President John DiBiaggio resumed meetings with black
students on Monday who were demanding, among other things, more
black faculty members.
   The peaceful sit-in at Stanford attracted several hundred
supporters Monday and prompted 12 faculty members to sign a
statement of support deploring the use of police and asking
university president Donald Kennedy to negotiate with the students.
   ``I think it's only the beginning, actually,'' said Julie Su,
20, a spokeswoman for the Asian American Students' Association.
``It shows students aren't going to let down, they aren't going to
be intimidated.''
   Most of those arrested were released after being cited for
misdemeanors that included unlawful asssembly, trespassing and
failure to disperse, said university spokeswoman Eileen Walsh.
   About 60 students occupied or barricaded Kennedy's office Monday
morning. Daylong negotiations between students and university
officials failed, and Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies began
arresting protesters in the late afternoon.
   Twelve of those arrested were taken to the county jail in San
Jose, where they were booked for investigation of misdemeanor
charges, Walsh said.
   Another 40 were cited and released after a crowd of several
hundred cheering supporters prevented the sheriff's bus full of
arrestees from leaving by creating a blockade of bodies, cars and
bicycles, Walsh said.
   Three other participants were cited for resisting and delaying
an officer, Walsh said. They were released.
   The protest was organized by the Stanford Asian-American
Students Association, the Black Student Union, the American Indian
Organization, the Committee on a Democratic Education, and MEChA, a
group representing Chicano students.
   The students sought a meeting with Kennedy to discuss demands
relating to minority hiring, discrimination and undergraduate
education.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Down 2.7 Percent in April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Housing construction, feeling the bite of
higher interest rates, fell 2.7 percent in April to the lowest
level in more than six years, the government said today.
   It marked the first time housing construction had dropped for
three straight months since the pace of activity slowed for five
months in a row from February through June 1987, the Commerce
Department reported.
   Last month's decline followed decreases of 4.5 percent in March
and 12.7 percent in February.
   New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.36 million units in April, the slowest pace since
the 1.30 million pace of December 1982.
   The housing industry has been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit as interest rates have edged upward over the past year.
Interest on fixed-rate mortgages last month was averaging over 11
percent, up a full percentage point from a year earlier, according
to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates rates in an effort to restrain inflation by
restraining economic growth.
   Construction of single-family homes rose 5.1 percent in April to
an annual rate of 1.04 million units, after dropping 4.2 percent in
March and 14.2 percent in February.
   Apartment construction, meanwhile, continued its decline,
falling 21.3 percent last month to an annual rate of 325,000 units.
Construction of multi-family units had fallen 5.3 percent in March
and 9 percent in February.
   The overall decline in housing construction last month was led
by 10.8 percent decrease in activity in the West, where starts fell
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 347,000 units.
   Declines also were recorded in the Midwest and South.
Construction was down 9.5 percent in the Midwest to a annual rate
of 277,000 units and off 4 percent in the South to a rate of
529,000.
   The Northeast, meanwhile, recorded a 35.9 percent surge in
construction to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 208,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, turned up 7.2 percent in April after dropping in the
three previous months.

<HEAD>Tenor Walks Off Stage With Bad Throat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti walked off the
stage during the third act of Puccini's ``Tosca'' after his voice
cracked due to throat problems.
   Monday night's production began 45 minutes late at the Benedum
Center as doctors attended to Pavarotti backstage. He decided to go
on, but was forced to end the opera early in the third act when his
voice cracked on the high B-flat.
   Pavarotti mumbled ``Sorry'' and signaled the conductor to start
again, but he approached the same note with the same results.
   ``I cannot do it. I am sorry,'' he told the audience. He then
put his head down and walked off the stage.
   After a few moments, the curtain fell and the houselights came
on. The audience applauded.
   It was Pavarotti's first appearance in Pittsburgh in a fully
staged opera production.
   Pittsburgh Opera Director Tito Capobianco said a decision would
be made today on whether Pavarotti would repeat the performance
tonight for the same crowd, some of whom paid $90 to hear the famed
tenor. Four more sold-out performances are scheduled through next
week.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Library Opens New Chapter Three Years After Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles Central Library has reopened
for business, nearly three years after two arson fires destroyed or
damaged more than 1 million books.
   ``Everybody's very excited,'' Central Library Director Betty Gay
said on opening day Monday. ``It's like show time, the first day.''
   The reopening in temporary quarters marked the culmination of
months of work by 300 librarians and hundreds of volunteers, who
restored the 700,000 books damaged by fires in April and September
of 1986.
   Much of the damage was caused by water, and the books had to be
freeze-dried and stored in a refrigerated warehouse to prevent mold
and mildew.
   The library's temporary home is eight floors of the downtown
Title Insurance Building until workers complete renovation of the
landmark library building, probably in 1992.
   ``They took so long to open _ three years,'' said Roger Fuentes,
a 55-year-old retiree and library patron. ``I live nearby, and I
spend my days in the library. It fills up my time and, at the same
time, I always learn something new.''
   The first arson fire destroyed 375,000 books and caused $22
million in damage.
   The second fire, five months later, destroyed 25,000 books and
caused another $2 million in damage.
   Many librarians said Monday that working the checkout counter
again was a lot better than restoring books.
   ``Three years of cleaning, stacking and inventory,'' said Sherie
Sanford, shaking her head.
   The reopening also will make more books available to the city's
63 branch libraries, which borrow books from the Central Library.
   ``Today is a joyous day,'' said library spokesman Bob Reagan,
``not only for the general public but also for the library system
itself.''
   No arrests were made for either fire.

<DATELINE>PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent black
activists were freed today after being jailed without charge for
nearly three years, but they were placed under nighttime house
arrest and barred from political activity.
   Henry Fazzie, 65, and Mkhuseli Jack, 31, led community groups in
Port Elizabeth's black townships that were affiliated with the
United Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition. They
were principal organizers of a highly effective black consumer
boycott of white-owned stores in 1985-86.
   The two were arrested along with several colleagues in August
1986, two months after President P.W. Botha declared a national
state of emergency.
   An estimated 30,000 activists have been held without charge for
varying periods during the emergency, although all but a few dozen
have been freed.
   Fazzie, Jack and four colleagues were released today from St.
Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth, ending speculation that the
government might lodge treason charges against them. Fazzie's wife,
Beauty, and several other activists were freed last week.
   During nationwide black unrest in 1985, Port Elizabeth's
townships were considered to have among the most militant and
best-organized opposition activity.
   The consumer boycott, which continued through mid-1986,
inflicted heavy losses on many white businessmen and prompted the
local chamber of commerce to engage in negotiations over the black
community's grievances.
   Restrictions imposed on the six men freed today bar them from
attending any meetings, restrict them to their homes between dusk
and sunrise, prohibit them from leaving the Port Elizabeth area,
and prohibit them from writing articles for publication or granting
interviews.
   Human rights groups say restrictions have been imposed on a
majority of the roughly 900 detainees freed since a wave of hunger
strikes began in January.
   The Human Rights Commission, an independent group founded by
anti-apartheid activists, alleged Monday that the government had
transferred 10 hunger-striking detainees from Johannesburg to
Bloemfontein, about 240 miles away.
   The government has said previously that detainees who stage
hunger strikes might be moved to Bloemfontein, but Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok said last week that no such protests were
being conducted by any detainees.
   The Human Rights Commission said the 10 black detainees had gone
without food or liquids since May 7. It described the transfer from
Johannesburg as an attempt ``to bully them into submission by
isolating them.''

<TEXT>
   The reputed high priestess of a
drug-trafficking religious cult was being held without bond today
after she and four other men were indicted on charges stemming from
the ritual slayings of 15 people.
   Indicted by Judge Bernardo Tirado on murder and related charges
were Sara Aldrete Villarreal, Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, Alvaro de
Leon Valdez, Juan Carlos Fragoso and Jorge Montes.
   Tirado refused to set bail Monday because the charges are
punishable by more than five-year sentences. Murder conviction
carries a 50-year sentence.
   Ms. Aldrete, 24, and her Cuban-American boyfriend Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo were considered leaders of the cult, with Ms.
Aldrete the priestess and Constanzo the godfather.
   The case broke last month when Mexican police discovered the
first of 15 bodies buried at the Matamoros ranch. Ms. Aldrete has
testified that some of the victims were killed in ritual sacrifices
and the deaths of others were related to drugs.
   One of the sacrificial victims was Mark Kilroy, 21, a university
student from Santa Fe, Texas.
   Ms. Aldrete, de Leon Valdez and Orea Ochoa were arrested May 6
in a fourth-floor apartment in Mexico City after a gunfight with
police.
   As police closed in Constanzo, 26, ordered his companions to
kill him and his closest associate, Martin Quintana Rodriguez,
according to investigators.
   De Leon Valdez told authorities he shot them to death with a
submachine gun. Ms. Aldrete and Orea Ochoa also are charged in the
deaths.
   Orea Ochoa, Fragoso and Montes are accused of killing Ramon
Baez, a male transvestite, in a Mexico City apartment in July and
dismembering the body.
   Court clerk Marco Aurelio Camacho said all five defendants were
charged with homicide, two counts of criminal association, coverup
and resisting arrest.
   Another defendant, Jose Enrique Calzada, was charged Sunday with
coverup for allegedly helping Constanzo and other cult members
avoid arrest. He pleaded innocent at his arraignment and was
released on $2,500 bond.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 doctors at government
hospitals here went on strike today for higher pay, forcing
hundreds of patients to seek medical care elsewhere.
   Doctors want a $53 dollar a month raise, an increase from $16 to
$40 in a government allowance that compensates for them not being
allowed to maintain private practices, and a promotion schedule.
   ``Unless the government meets our demands there is no way we are
going to resume work,'' said Dr. Ashwani Bhatnagar, a leader of the
Doctor's Association which is leading the strike.
   At the capital's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, 225 of the 300
doctors walked off the job and many of the 800 beds were left
empty. Many patients at the hospital were discharged Monday night
in anticipation of the strike.
   ``We normally treat 2,500 to 3,000 people daily,'' said C.D.
Chauhan, a senior doctor, who alone was responsible for the 50
emergency room patients today. ``This morning I have managed to see
only about two dozen people.''
   ``It is painful to watch people suffer, but we had given enough
time to the government to settle our demands,'' Bhatnagar said.
   In India, government doctors are not permitted to maintain
private practices, but many prefer the state jobs, which provide a
certain financial security.
   New Delhi's 10 government hospitals together have 5,000 beds and
normally treat more than 20,000 to 25,000 people daily. The poor
receive low cost or free health care at the state hospitals.

   Bones found during a search last week
belonged to an animal, according to authorities searching for the
remains of a woman slain by serial killer Ted Bundy.
   Officers have been searching for the remains of Debi Kent, 17,
of Bountiful. Bundy said in interviews before his execution Jan. 24
in Florida that he buried her body in Fairview Canyon in central
Utah.
   Bountiful Police Sgt. Ira Beal said the medical examiner's
office determined Monday that the bones found last week were from
an animal.
   Previous searches have turned up many animal bones and a human
knee cap. That bone is being analyzed in an attempt to determine
the age and sex of the person.
   ``We have no intentions of going back unless something else
develops,'' Beal said. ``We've searched that area as thorough as
you can. There really isn't a lot more to go on.''

<TEXT>
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev denied
allegations of involvement in high-level corruption, the Novosti
press agency said today.
   Ligachev, a conservative who is considered a rival of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``resolutely denied'' the allegations made by
a prosecutor in an election campaign, the official news agency said.
   Ligachev issued the statement to the Supreme Soviet Presidium,
the nation's top executive body, which already was investigating
the prosecutor, Nikolai Ivanov, for abuses of power.
   It was an extraordinary defense by a Politburo member of his
conduct, and remarkable in that it was made public in a telex sent
by Novosti to The Associated Press bureau in Moscow. The personal
lives of Politburo members are usually shrouded in secrecy, and are
not reported by official Soviet media.
   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, became nationally known
investigating corruption among local officials in the republic of
Uzbekistan. The investigation reulted in a 12-year jail sentence
for Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   On Leningrad television Friday night, Ivanov said their
investigation turned up the names of Ligachev and several other top
government officials. He did not go into details.
   Ivanov on Sunday won a seat in the newly formed parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``Yegor Ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations and
called the attention of the commission to the fact that the
slanderous statement was intended as a political provocation,''
Novosti said.
   ``He insists that the case be thoroughly considered and the
results reported in the press,'' Novosti continued.
   A Presidium commission was formed to consider citizen complaints
that the two prosecutors abused their power in investigating
high-level corruption. The Presidium is chaired by Gorbachev.
   The commission said in the Communist Party daily Pravda on
Saturday that the two prosecutors made ``provocative statements''
about ``violations of law'' by some political leaders, and accused
them of trying to disorient people and interfere with the
commission.
   A separate probe by the Supreme Court already has determined
that Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 in Estonia. The
accused, an eminent scientist, died in jail. The Supreme Court has
asked the prosecutor's office to consider dismissing Gdlyan as a
result of that case.
   Gdlyan also won election to the new parliament in an earlier
round. Both prosecutors garnered overwhelming majorities of votes
in their districts during the balloting, which saw large numbers of
party loyalists upset by reform candidates.

<HEAD>Ohio Highway Patrol Head Ousted After South Africa Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The superintendent of the Ohio Highway
Patrol has been fired because he accepted a free vacation to South
Africa as the guest of one of that racially segregated nation's
cities.
   Director William Denihan of the Ohio Department of Highway
Safety, whose agency oversees the patrol, dismissed Col. Jack Walsh
on Monday after Walsh refused a demotion to the rank of major.
   ``Given the circumstances and the sensitive political
ramifications of this all-expense-paid trip, Colonel Walsh, I feel,
exhibited a serious breach of confidence and ethics towards me,
towards this administration, and towards his fellow patrol
employees,'' Denihan said.
   Walsh took the trip without notifying Denihan or Gov. Richard
Celeste.
   Walsh, 53, who spent 31 years with the Highway Patrol, said he
saw nothing wrong with taking the trip. His expenses were paid by
the city of Johannesburg.
   Walsh could not be reached for comment; his home telephone
number is not published. But he told The Columbus Dispatch he
opposes racial discrimination.
   ``I never talked to anyone in South Africa who supports
apartheid,'' he said.
   ``I really can't see there is any conflict with my job as a
police officer, as superintendent of the highway patrol,'' Walsh
said. ``I guess the next thing is you won't be able to o to a
library and read a book on South Africa.''
   Walsh told the newspaper his trip included a tour of Soweto, a
township where 1.5 million blacks live under the policy of
apartheid, or racial separation.
   Walsh, who was paid about $54,000 annually, and his wife, Huey,
were among a group of U.S. officials who took the trip, worth an
estimated $18,000 per person. He still will be eligible for his
pension benefits from the patrol.
   Denihan said Walsh's action was an example of impaired judgment
which affected his credibility and his ability to continue as the
patrol's chief officer.
   ``This is his second (free) trip to Johannesburg, (South
Africa), not his first trip,'' Denihan said. He said expenses for
the first trip were paid by the Johannesburg Safety Council, while
the trip this month was financed by the Johannesburg City Council.
   Walsh was appointed patrol superintendent in 1979 by former Gov.
James A. Rhodes. He also was chairman of the Highway Patrol
Retirement System, a pension fund which has interests in companies
that conduct business in South Africa.

   A municipal judge has been given the maximum
sentence of five years in federal prison for bribery and income tax
evasion, despite pleas by her attorney that her gambling habit made
her a victim.
   ``I have disgraced my family, my profession, my child,'' Detroit
Recorder's Court Judge Evelyn Cooper said at Monday's sentencing.
``... I hope that in the future I will be able to forgive myself.''
   Cooper was one of three Detroit judges indicted last year on
bribery charges following a federal investigation.
   Cooper, 47, pleaded guilty to the two charges in March in a plea
bargain agreement in which extortion, racketeering and other income
tax evasion charges were dropped. She could have faced 20 years in
prison.
   She admitted accepting $7,000 in bribes to rule in favor of
defendants and hand down lenient sentences.
   Defense attorney Cornelius Pitts called Cooper a victim of
``human failing. ... The disease of gambling.''
   ``I'm not going to have my head turned by your pretty little
words,'' U.S. District Judge George Woods said, saying Cooper
abused ``her high position of trust and betrayed her community that
needed her skills so desperately.''
   U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said the sentence ``reflects the
serious assault on the integrity of the Michigan criminal justice
system and on the public trust.''
   Woods allowed Cooper to remain free on bond until June 12.
   Of the other two judges indicted, one pleaded guilty and is
serving a 10-year sentence, and the other was acquitted on four
charges and is awaiting retrial on a fifth.

<TEXT>
   Two police officers beat a blind man with
their batons after mistaking his collapsible cane for an illegal
martial arts weapon, police said.
   ``It bothers me to the core and I want to get to the bottom of
this right away,'' said Acting Police Chief Dick Dettmer, who on
Monday announced an investigation into the incident.
   According to a police report, field training officer Eric
Ristrim was with trainee Marie Yin on Thursday when they came upon
David St. John, 37, standing at a bus stop.
   Ristrim said St. John placed in his pants pocket what appeared
to be a set of nunchakus, a martial arts weapon which consists of
two round sticks of wood connected by a chain. Possession of the
weapon is illegal in California.
   The officers thought the man could see their uniforms so they
didn't identify themselves when they demanded that St. John hand
over the contents of his pockets, the report said.
   St. John said later he thought he was about to be mugged and a
struggle followed.
   ``I did what my self-defense training and my instincts told me
to do,'' a bruised and swollen St. John said Monday.
   Ristrim said St. John's eyes were milky in color but were wide
open ``as if looking directly'' at him.
   The officers said they first hit St. John twice on the legs.
Then when he pulled the cane out of his pocket ``and raised it to
about face level'' they struck him on the forearm in an attempt to
get him to drop it.
   It was then that someone yelled, ``he's blind'' and the officers
identified themselves, bringing an end to the struggle.
   ``It's a very regrettable incident,'' Dettmer said.
   ``They ought to be careful who they clobber with their night
sticks,'' said St. John, who was on his way to beep-baseball
practice when the beating occurred.
   In beep-baseball, the ball emits a beeping sound to help
visually impaired players.

<HEAD>Protest In Central Square Grows, More Join Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with larger crowds, official urging
end to demonstrations, more students hospitalized; edits to conform; no

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people converged on
China's central square today in the most serious challenge yet to a
government reeling from a month of pro-democracy protests.
   It was by far the largest gathering so far in Tiananmen Square,
where crowds stopped traffic on a six-lane avenue and nearly
surrounded the adjacent Great Hall of the People, which was
protected by hundreds of troops and police.
   Embarrassing China's Communist leaders, the protesters _ about
3,000 of them on a hunger strike since Saturday _ have refused to
leave the square during the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
The added attention from Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit seems to have
encouraged them.
   A scheduled meeting in the Great Hall between Gorbachev and
China's Premier Li Peng was hastily moved to the state guest house
about 3 miles away as entrances to the hall were clogged with
students and onlookers.
   Because of the student occupation, officials already had to move
the official welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev from the 100-acre
square on Monday and cancel a wreath-laying ceremony today.
   ``Government _ how long will you allow the students to starve?''
read a banner carried by journalists of the conservative state-run
Guangming Daily, one of thousands of red-and-white banners lofted
by marchers.
   More than 350 hunger strikers had been hospitalized suffering
from dehydration and exposure by late today, although some later
returned after treatment. A steady stream of ambulances with
flashing blue lights entered the square.
   Observers estimated today's crowd at more than 300,000, by far
the largest crowd since pro-democracy demonstrations broke out on
April 15.
   The students want democratic reform, chiefly a free press, but
another condition for ending the hunger strike is a government
apology for an April 26 newspaper editorial that accused them of
plotting against the state.
   A top party official, Yan Mingfu, addressed the students in a
speech over loudspeakers and said that he supported their demands.
But he said the government needed more time to consider them and
urged the students to leave. Fasting students took a hasty vote and
decided to remain in the square.
   Protest groups from at least eight newspapers, emboldened by the
students' demand for freedom of the press, joined the march on the
square. Another group of 800 from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences was led by a trumpeteer.
   ``We are giving the government a push toward a more democratic
state,'' said Zhang Yong, who reads the nightly English-language
newscast on nationwide television.
   Zhang, who wore sunglasses and handed out autographs, said his
colleagues were ``very, very embarrassed'' by coverage of the
protests censored by officials.
   Workers, including factory laborers and coal miners, were
prominent in the crowds, and employees of at least three government
ministries also participated.
   ``I saw them (the students) passing by and ... I knew I had to
join them,'' said one worker who refused to give his name.
   ``We want the right to strike,'' said Song Lou, a teacher at the
Workers' Movement Institute.
   One group of 60 museum workers dramatically entered the square
from underneath the huge portrait of Mao Tse-tung that hangs above
the gate to the adjacent Forbidden City, once home to China's
emperors.
   They carried a huge yellow banner reading, ``Forbidden City
workers'' and chanted, ``Democracy, democracy.''
   At least 1,000 students also took to the streets in Shanghai
today in support of the hunger strikers in Beijing, an American
teacher in the city said.
   On Tiananmen Square, more than 1,000 medical students and
doctors set up an emergency tent amid the sprawled bodies of the
hunger strikers and administered glucose and salt water
intraveneously to fainting fasters.
   ``We can handle 10 at a time,'' said one medical student.
   Twelve students had decided last night to stop drinking water.
``They are terrible. They are lying on ice'' to keep them cool, a
doctor said. Two had fainted by late afternoon.
   The number of hunger strikers also grew as more people,
including some teachers pledged abstinence until their demands for
a dialogue with the government and democratic reforms are realized.
   Students said the strike could go on indefinitely if the numbers
of participants continues to grow.
   The city's emergency medical center sent aspirin and other
medication for the students. Almost every hospital in the city was
involved.
   ``If they are wise the government will give way,'' a doctor said.
   One of the strikers, Mao Shijing, a philosophy graduate student
at Beijing Normal Univiersity, said, ``sometimes I have a little
pain, sometimes I'm dizzy. Yesterday I stood up too fast and I
fainted. By night it's cold and by day it's hot. The worst thing of
all is the sun beating down on us.''
   Students who have been collecting contributions from
sympathizers bought umbrellas and hats for the strikers.
   The students are demanding recognition of their independently
formed organizations and a dialogue with the government on such
issues as press freedom and official corruption.
   The government has agreed to talk to representatives of official
student groups, but maintains that the student activist groups are
illegal.

   Iran today denied involvement in the Dec.
21 bombing of a Pan American jumbo jet that killed 270 people, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unnamed foreign
ministry spokesman as saying that the CIA had alleged Iran was
involved in the bombing. He said the allegations were ``mere lies.''
   Shortly after the crash, an anonynous caller purporting to speak
for a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of the Revolution
telephoned major news organizations in London to claim
responsibility for the disaster.
   Western investigators have been quoted as saying they suspect
the bombing was carried out by a radical Syrian-backed Palestinian
faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command at the behest of Iran.
   The front's leader, Ahmed Jibril, denied in a U.S. television
interview April 15 that his group carried out the Pan Am bombing.
   Numerous news reports have quoted some investigators as saying
that Pan Am Flight 103, flying from Frankfurt to New York, may have
been bombed in retaliation for the downing of an Iranian airliner
in July.
   The U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes shot down the Iran Air plane
over the Persian Gulf after mistaking it for an Iranian fighter
jet. All 290 people aboard were killed.
   The bomb aboard the Boeing 747 exploded as the plane was flying
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. All 259 people aboard were
killed, along with 11 people on the ground.
   IRNA quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the
West was using the Pan Am bombing as a pretext to confront Iran,
``particularly after the West's defeat in the Salman Rushdie
affair.''
   Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in
February issued a death sentence against the British writer for
allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   That plunged Iran into a major confrontation with the West.
Tehran claimed that widespread backing for Khomeini's action in the
Moslem world amounted to a defeat for the West.
   The Iranian spokesman accused the United States of being ``a
founder and promoter of state terrorism,'' IRNA said.
   He branded the downing of the Iran Air Airbus an act of state
terrorism, IRNA noted.

<TEXT>
   Howard ``Buddy'' Jacobson, a one-time top
horse trainer convicted of killing his former girlfriend's lover in
a highly publicized New York City trial, died early today, a state
prison official said.
   Jacobson, 58, died at the Erie County Medical Center where he
had been under treatment for cancer, state Department of
Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau said. He had been
serving his sentence at Attica state prison, about 25 miles east of
Buffalo.
   Jacobson was the top horse trainer in the United States in 1963
and was the leading trainer at New York state tracks five times. He
also accumulated a fortune in modeling agency and real estate
ventures.
   Jacobson was serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for
second-degree murder in the Aug. 6, 1978, killing of John Tupper.
Prosecutors claimed Jacobson killed Tupper in jealousy over
Tupper's affair with model Melanie Cain.
   Tupper, 33, was shot six times, stabbed and beaten. His body was
found in a dump in the Bronx.
   Cain, who appeared on the covers of several national magazines
including Cosmopolitan and Red Book, had lived with Jacobson for
four years but the relationship ended 22 days before Tupper's death.
   Jacobson repeatedly maintained that he did not kill Tupper. He
claimed Tupper was murdered not because of the love triangle with
Cain and Jacobson but because of alleged drug-selling activities.
He was convicted in 1980.
   In May 1980 Jacobson escaped from a Brooklyn jail by changing
places with a man posing as his lawyer. He was captured 40 days
later in Manhattan Beach, Calif.

   At 10:03 a.m. today, China's senior leader Deng
Xiaoping emerged from the Eastern Hall of the Great Hall of the
People and walked slowly along a red carpet to meet his Soviet
guest.
   Heading toward him was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who had
arrived in Beijing a day earlier to bury 30 years of enmity between
the two communist neighbors.
   ``Welcome Comrade Gorbachev, I am happy we can meet each
other,'' Deng smiled as he shook the Soviet leader's hand for more
than a minute.
   The greeting was cordial, if not quite brotherly.
   Although he called Gorbachev ``comrade,'' Deng did not offer the
bear hug he gives to some foreign dignitaries who are his personal
friends or from countries close to China.
   The two leaders chatted briefly outside the Eastern Hall, with
Deng at one point turning toward a crowd of photographers and
remarking that the world was interested in the historic meeting.
   The two leaders, Gorbachev in a grey Western suit and Deng
wearing a Mao suit, then entered the ornate room to get down to
business. Each sat in a plush chair, a table with an elaborate
flower arrangement between them and two interpreters sitting just
behind.
   Deng, who at 84 is the grand old man of world Communism, did
most of the talking at the beginning, lecturing Gorbachev, a
generation younger at 58, about problems brought about by the
superpowers.
   At times, the Soviet leader leaned forward with hands clasped as
he listened.
   Although he stuttered and slurred some words, as he often does,
Deng's voice grew stronger as the conversation progressed.
   ``To be frank, the key political problems of the world come from
relations between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' said
Deng. ``For many years, the special characteristics of that
situation were such that the arms race continued and did not
abate.''
   Deng then mentioned Gorbachev's 1986 Vladivostok speech in which
he offered an olive branch to China.
   ``I personally could see that your policy had a new content,''
said Deng.
   ``Thank you,'' replied Gorbachev.
   Deng noted that three years had passed since he first relayed
through Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu an interest in meeting
with Gorbachev. ``Finally we succeeded in coming together,'' he
said.
   ``You had three obstacles and that is why we needed three
years,'' replied Gorbachev, who added with a chuckle, ``One year
for each obstacle.''
   The three obstacles have been the Soviet military presence in
Afghanistan, Soviet troop deployment on the Chinese border and the
Kremlin's support of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.
   Just after authorities began to usher journalsts from the hall,
Deng wanted one last word for the record.
   ``Because the journalists have not left us, we can take this
opportunity to publicly announce the normalization of relations
between our two countries,'' he said to applause of officials of
both countries.

<TEXT>
   George Bush earned $156,000 from a blind trust
worth nearly $1 million in his final year as vice president and
with his wife Barbara accepted more than $21,000 in gifts, a
financial disclosure form shows.
   The gifts ranged from two $75 ties for Bush from an official
with the Coca-Cola Co., to a gold watch valued at $7,800 given to
Mrs. Bush by the Ladies of the Senate Red Cross Chapter.
   The form indicated the Bushes have non-real estate assets of
$1.09 million. In addition, their house in Kennebunkport, Maine _
not required to be listed _ is estimated to be worth about $1
million, taking their likely net worth past $2 million.
   It was the first time that the exact value of Bush's trust _
$998,000 at year's end _ had been disclosed. The trust was set up
in January 1981 when Bush, a former Texas oil executive, became
vice president.
   Bush was not required to list specific amounts on his holdings
and income, but did so anyway.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``the
president has proposed in his new ethics package that more specific
data be provided'' and he wanted to set an example.
   The example was not followed by Vice President Dan Quayle,
however, who filed a far less detailed disclosure statement.
   Quayle's filing showing assets held by him and his wife Marilyn
in 1988 _ when he was a senator representing Indiana _ of no less
than $440,000 and up to $740,000 or more.
   During his campaign, Quayle valued his net worth at slightly
under $1 million.
   Quayle reported income on holdings of from $18,500 to $52,000.
He also reported fees for speeches of $52,797 _ of which he donated
$17,304 to charities to keep within the federal limit on honoraria.
   Computing his worth is further complicated because Quayle's
major asset _ his 99 shares and his wife's 40 shares in Central
Newspapers Inc. _ have no set market value since the company is
family-owned and the stock is not traded, according to his press
secretary, David Beckwith.
   Beckwith said Quayle technically was not required to fill out a
financial disclosure form for 1988 _ he was between jobs at year's
end _ but did so anyway. Beckwith said the one he files next year
is likely to follow Bush's lead in providing greater detail.
   Bush's report, his first as president, also showed that earlier
this year he paid off $49,000 in three loans he took out in 1979
against life insurance policies.
   Bush's pay as president is $200,000 a year; Quayle's salary as
vice president is $115,000.
   Bush put the value of his share of a Houston barge company,
which state documents filed in Austin show is a joint business
venture with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, at $31,000.
   Bush earned $11,962 last year on the investment, the financial
document showed.
   Other assets listed by Bush include: $1,000 in a White House
savings account; $3,000 in an interest-bearing checking account in
Kennebunkport; $28,000 in an individual retirement account for
himself and $2,300 in a companion IRA for Mrs. Bush.
   The forms also show a life insurance policy on Mrs. Bush with a
cash value of $13,000.
   They show that as of Dec. 31, Bush had about $6,000 in a regular
checking account in a Washington bank and about $5,000 in a
checking account in Houston.
   He also listed an $18,000 ``deferred compensation arrangement''
that he will get at age 65 _ this June _ from the Zapata Corp., the
offshore oil drilling company he set up in Texas in the late 1950s.
   The Bushes reported gifts of $21,009 in 1988. Federal law
requires that all gifts worth more than $100 be reported, and that
foreign gifts exceeding $180 be returned.
   Among gifts reported by Bush and his wife were: 10 country and
western cassette tapes from MCA Records, worth $100; a $425 pen set
from Peter Bentley of Parker Pens, Janesville, Wis.; and two
neckties worth $150 from Roberto Goizueta, an executive of the
Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta.
   Also: a cowboy hat and jacket, worth $124, from the Houston
Livestock Show; two pairs of walking shoes from the Rockport Co.,
valued at $184; two pairs of running shoes from Aviva, worth $100;
a porcelain vase worth $120 from Li Changchun, an official in
China's Liaoning Provincial Government.
   Mrs. Bush reported a Tiffany gold watch, worth $7,800, from the
Ladies of the Senate Red Cross Chapter. A company called
``Footstools Unlimited'' gave the first family two footstools,
valued at $240.
   Reported gifts also included more than a dozen paintings and
other original works of art, baseball and flight jackets, fishing
reels, various items of food, pillows, toy soldiers, a lamp,
several bowls, cosmetics, caviar, sweaters, workshirts, picture
frames, videotapes, a pool cue, an album of postage stamps and a
wine decanter.

   A majority of the elderly persons who are
familiar with the new catastrophic illness provisions of Medicare
are unhappy with the program, according to a survey commissioned by
a group seeking reduction of the surtax that helps finance the plan.
   The Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a group formed to
lobby against the law that took effect Jan. 1, released a poll
Monday which suggests only about 60 percent of the 33 million
Medicare beneficiaries covered by the program are familiar with it.
   Of that 60 percent, the survey found, 53 percent said they are
disenchanted with the new program signed into law last year by
then-President Reagan after overwhelming congressional approval.
   The program, the first major Medicare expansion in the program's
history, is designed to protect Medicare beneficiaries against
catastrophic medical expenses by limiting the amount they have to
pay out of pocket for hospital bills and, starting next year,
doctor bills as well.
   The basic objections are that the program doesn't cover
long-term nursing care and costs more than it is worth,
particularly for those with enough income to make them subject to a
15 percent income tax surcharge to help pay for it.
   For more than 60 percent of those eligible for Medicare _ those
with too little taxable income to have to pay federal income taxes
_ the only additional expense this year is a $4-a month flat
premium. But for the others, the surtax can range up to $800 per
person per year.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has introduced legislation to
delay implementation of the surtax and major parts of the plan that
have not taken effect, said Congress has been hit by a
``firestorm'' of protest from some of the millions who are subject
to the surtax.
   Although congressional studies indicate no more than 5 percent
of those eligible for Medicare would be hit by the maximum
surcharge, members of the coalition said they also are receiving
many complaints from those who would pay lesser amounts.
   Sponsors of the survey acknowledged that although 72 percent of
those questioned reported overall incomes of less than $30,000 and
thus would not be subject to the maximum tax, pollsters did not ask
the 1,008 people telephoned earlier this month if they knew how
much of a surtax, if any, they would have to pay. The poll,
conducted by The Wirthlin Group, had a 3.1 percent margin of error.
   T.J. Kilcline, a retired Navy vice admiral and president of the
Retired Officers Association, acknowledged that ``most people don't
really know what they're going to pay this year'' because the 1989
surtax will not be calculated by most until they fill out their tax
returns next year.
   Many elderly people who would pay tax if they were still working
for a taxable wage have little or no federal income tax liability
because most or all of their income is from tax-free Social
Security benefits.
   For example, 48 percent of those questioned for the poll said
they had gross incomes below $15,000, making it unlikely they would
be liable for any substantial surcharge _ if any at all.
   For a couple with a taxable income of $10,000, after tax-free
Social Security benefits and other deductions have been subtracted
from gross income, the catastrophic coverage surcharge would be
$225 _ or $112.50 each.
   The maximum $1,600 for such a couple _ $800 each _ would apply
to those with a taxable income of at least $53,000. Such a couple
already would be paying $10,816 a year in income taxes.

   The Rev. Russell Barker wasn't about to rely on
blessed assurance when he came upon a burly, pipe-wielding burglar
in his church.
   Barker, pastor of the North Avenue Missionary Baptist Church in
northwest Atlanta, held his .38-caliber revolver on the suspect,
Joe Wilson, until police arrived.
   ``Sometimes you do something you don't want to do,'' Barker
said. ``But I was able to take care of myself. I made him lay down
on his face and he didn't come no further.''
   Barker, 56, said that when he arrived for work Monday morning he
heard the suspect rummaging around in a rear office of the church,
which has been burglarized at least seven times in the past three
years.
   Barker retrieved his gun from the trunk of his car and found the
suspect trying to crawl out through the ceiling in the women's
restroom. He aimed the gun at Wilson with one hand and telephoned
police with the other.
   Police said Barker's action was a brave one.
   ``He's (Wilson) a pretty good-sized guy, and the reverend's kind
of small,'' said Sgt. C.W. Richardson. ``When we got there, he was
sitting on the floor.''
   Wilson, 23, was charged with burglary and possession of burglary
tools.

   A second opposition lawmaker linked to an
influence-peddling scandal that has rocked Japan's government has
resigned from Parliament.
   Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone agreed to
testify in Parliament about his links to the scandal, Kyodo News
Service reported. Opposition parties have stalled parliamentary
business to back demands that he testify.
   Katsuya Ikeda, 51, a four-term member of the House of
Representatives, cited personal reasons today for his resignation
from Parliament and from the Clean Government Party, the
second-largest opposition party after the Socialists.
   In November, a member of the Japan Socialist Party, Takumi Ueda,
gave up his seat in Parliament after news reports linked him with
the scandal.
   Ikeda, a former journalist, acknowledged in November that his
brother, Yuzuru, bought 5,000 unlisted stock shares from Recruit
Co. at a bargain price in 1986. After public trading began and the
stock price soared, the brother made a profit of about $73,530.
   The company, accused of trying to influence government policy,
sold such shares in a Recruit subsidiary to some 160 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   It also made large political contributions to politicians
including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who announced last month
he would resign to take responsibility for the scandal.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party still is searching for a
candidate untainted by the scandal but commanding widespread
support in the party to succeed Takeshita. It hopes a new leader
with a clean reputation will reverse the party's loss in popularity
before elections this summer for half the seats in Parliament's
upper house.
   Ikeda has denied personal involvement in his brother's stock
transactions, but news reports said $51,470 of the profit was
deposited into Ikeda's bank account, and that Ikeda also received
$102,940 in donations from Recruit.
   The reports said Ikeda used his influence as a member of the
government's Education Affairs Committee in 1986 for the benefit of
Recruit, which specializes in publishing employment information for
students.
   At a news conference, Ikeda denied receiving the donation, and
that the stock deal was in return for favors for Recruit.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and Recruit
executives so far on charges of bribery and securities law
violations in the stock deals. In addition, three members of
Takeshita's Cabinet have resigned because of links with Recruit.
   Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of the stock deals
and whose aides were among Recruit stock purchasers, previously had
said he would testify in Parliament only after prosecutors
completed their investigations of the Recruit case.
   This time, in a meeting with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the ruling
party's deputy secretary general, Nakasone did not set any
conditions, Kyodo said.
   Opposition parties want to question Nakasone about the resale of
U.S.-made supercomputers to Recruit from Japan's telecommunications
giant, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. NTT's former chairman,
Hasashi Shinto, has been arrested on charges that he took bribes
from Recruit in the form of bargain stock shares.

<HEAD>Extradition Decision Postponed Until After June Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist government today postponed a
ruling on whether to extradite a suspected Palestinian terrorist to
the United States, saying it would decide after June 18 elections.
   The decision came four days after Greece's Supreme Court upheld
an extradition order sought by the United States. But the Justice
Ministry has final say in the matter.
   ``The Rashid case is a major one and the decision on whether he
should or should not be extradited to the United States will be
taken by the government that will emerge from the June elections,''
Justice Minister Yiannis Skoularikis said at a news conference.
   The Supreme Court had put off making a decision three times in
the sensitive case.
   Mohammed Rashid, 39, is accused of planting a bomb on a Pan Am
jumbo jet in 1982. A Japanese teenager was killed and 15 others
were wounded in the blast over Hawaii.
   American officials have described the extradition as a test of
Greece's willingness to fight terrorism.
   ``In any case, there is no question of extradition at this
moment because Rashid has to complete an eight-month sentence on
illegal weapons charges,'' Skoularikis said.
   Rashid, jailed since his arrest at Athens airport last May, was
convicted and sentenced on the weapons charge on March 28 after
guards found a set of makeshift knives in his cell.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has said Rashid is an
officer in its military branch. They have denied U.S. charges that
he is a terrorist.

<TEXT>
   Ogilvy Group Inc. has agreed to an $864 million
buyout offer in a deal that will create the world's second-largest
advertising and marketing concern.
   The boards of Oglivy and WPP Group PLC announced early today
they had approved the buyout under which the London-based WPP will
pay $54 a share in cash for all of Ogilvy's common stock.
   The agreement came just hours before today's annual meeting of
Ogilvy shareholders.
   ``While we would have preferred to remain independent and
pursued many options to that end, we became convinced that a
combination with WPP represented the most attractive course for the
future of our organization,'' said Ogilvy's chairman, Kenneth Roman.
   But he said after intensive conversations, he concluded the deal
offered the best course for the company and its shareholders.
   Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group, said he's certain
the combination ``will create the finest advertising and marketing
services group in the world.''
   At a news conference this morning, Roman and Sorrell said they
would keep the Ogilvy and Thompson agencies autonomous. Roman said
some Ogilvy clients told him they'd like to discuss how the agency
will be run under the WPP umbrella but none threatened to drop the
agency as a result of the deal.
   Sorrell said he first thought about the possibility of acquiring
Ogilvy after meeting with Roman in April 1988, but that it took
nearly a year to decide to make a firm proposal.
   Sorrell began his pursuit of Ogilvy only 2{ weeks ago when he
proposed a buyout at $45 a share.
   Roman said Ogilvy preferred to remain independent and that its
board would consider the offer in due course.
   On May 8, WPP said it had proposed to pay $50 a share for Ogilvy
stock. Four days later Ogilvy said it had entered into formal
discussions with WPP after the latter indicated it would be willing
to increase its offer from $50 a share in order to secure a
friendly agreement.
   The agreement would allow the New York-based Ogilvy Group to
operate autonomously within WPP, a fast-growing conglomeration of
advertising agencies, public relations and marketing services
concerns.
   Roman will continue to head the Ogilvy operations within WPP.
   In an added inducement, WPP said it would appoint Ogilvy founder
David Ogilvy chairman of WPP Group. The current WPP chairman, John
Symonds, will become deputy chairman.
   Only two years ago, WPP stunned the advertising world with its
uninvited but successful buyout of the parent of another U.S.
advertising giant, J. Walter Thompson. That deal had cost $566
million.
   The combination of WPP and Ogilvy will produce an advertising
and marketing services giant that would have had combined billings
in 1988 of about $13.5 billion.
   That would put it only slightly behind the industry leader,
London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, which had billings of just over
$13.5 billion in 1988, according to the trade magazine Advertising
Age.
   Sorrell said he intended to pay for the acquisition by raising
about $350 million through an issue of convertible preferred stock.
The rest would come from bank loans.
   Ogilvy, founded in 1948, is one of the better known names in the
advertising business. Its Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad agency has many
blue-chip clients including American Express Co., American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.

   Police today rounded up Arabs from the Gaza
Strip who work in Israel and ordered them to return home, the first
such mass sweep during the 17-month Palestinian uprising.
   On Israel radio, Police Commissioner David Krauss called for
Israeli employers to send Palestinian workers home to the coastal
strip.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the orders were aimed at
pressuring Arabs to halt violence in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   ``The intention is to warn the residents that permission for
free travel and work in Israel are not givens,'' Rabin told Israel
radio. ``They depend on the behavior of those who leave for work.''
   About 50,000 Arabs from Gaza and about 60,000 from the West Bank
work in Israel.
   It was uncertain how many workers were being rounded up. Most
were kept at home by a curfew declared Monday night in Gaza,
requiring all 700,000 of the strip's residents to stay at home. No
reason was given for the curfew but it was believed linked to the
recent death of an Israeli soldier, allegedly at the hands of
Palestinian guerrillas.
   Under Israeli law, Arabs from Gaza and the West Bank are not
allowed to stay in Israel overnight, but the law is widely skirted
by workers who sleep in dormitories or their work places.
   In Jerusalem, witnesses reported seeing police checking the
identities of Palestinians at major intersection. Those from Gaza
were reportedly put in police vehicles for tranport back to the
strip.
   At the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip, hundreds of
Palestinian workers sat on the ground under army guard, a witness
said. He said most were brought to the area in Israeli taxis and
then taken by army truck back to Gaza.
   The uprising has been more violent in the Gaza Strip in recent
weeks than in the West Bank. The smaller Gaza Strip, with few roads
leading into Israel, also can be more easily controlled by
authorities.
   Also today, a Palestinian died of gunshot wounds sustained
earlier in the week in a shootout with police. The death of Ali
Mahmoud Muhammed Jabber, 23, raised to 476 the number of
Palestinians killed in the uprising. Twenty-one Israelis also have
died.
   In Gaza City today, three Palestinians were shot and wounded in
clashes with troops, including a 20-year-old who was shot in the
back, Arab hospital officials said. In the West Bank a 22-year-old
man was reported shot by soldiers.
   Israeli officials, meanwhile, shrugged off the PLO's rejection
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections in the
territories and urged Palestinians to take part in the vote.
   Rabin told Israel radio that it would be the only offer of peace
by the government.
   ``There must be patience,'' Rabin said. ``They will understand
that they have only one alternative and that is based on the
government plan.... There is and will be no other alternative.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today flew to Washington to discuss
the 20-point peace plan with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   U.S. State Department envoy Dennis Ross was expected in Israel
this afternoon to brief Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on his
discussions in Egypt and Jordan on the plan, and to meet with
Palestinian leaders.
   The United States has asked Israel to clarify whether elections
would include the 140,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem, the nation's
capital, and if there would be international supervision of the
balloting.
   The plan, overwhelmingly approved by Israel's Cabinet on Sunday,
calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate with
Israel on a five-year period of limited autonomy, with talks in the
third year on the final status of the territories.
   However, Israel would not negotiate with the PLO. It also
opposes formation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza
and wants the negotiations to lead to a peace treaty with Jordan.

<HEAD>Free Press to Reduce Staff Through Attrition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit Free Press, seeking a partial merger
with its principal competitor, The Detroit News, says it will
reduce its staff without layoffs to cut costs.
   Free Press Publisher David Lawrence Jr. said Monday the staff
reductions will be accomplished by leaving vacancies unfilled
throughout the newspaper. He declined to say how many workers would
be affected.
   The comment came after Lawrence and newspaper President Robert
Hall met privately with representatives of the 11 unions at the
morning newspaper.
   Union workers at both papers have been working under extensions
of existing contracts since June 1987. Negotiations on new
contracts are scheduled to begin this week.
   The Free Press and the News are seeking permission from the U.S.
Supreme Court to combine some of their business functions.
Editorial and news departments would remain separate.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the proposed joint
operating agreement within a year.
   The Free Press has promised its owner, Knight-Ridder Inc., that
it would hold losses to 1988 levels of more than $17 million while
it waits for the Supreme Court's ruling. Knight-Ridder has said
without the joint agreement, the Free Press would be closed.
   Lawrence told union representatives that the newsstand price of
the paper would not increase and that workers would be offered
raises.

   Tight defense budgets will aggravate such
current problems plaguing U.S. technology as stiff foreign
competition, overregulation and delays in research, an official of
a congressional agency said today.
   Alan Shaw, manager of the Office of Technology Assessment's
international security and commerce program, said the once-large
U.S. advantage in a variety of defense technologies has been
reduced.
   ``The defense technology base is not in crisis,'' Shaw told the
Senate Armed Services subcommittee on defense industry and
technology. ``But it does face major problems.''
   Among those problems, cited in a report released today by the
Office of Technology Assessment, are an increase in the number of
foreign competitors, a vast number of rules and regulations that
slow the acquisition process and delays in translating research
into practical use.
   In addition, these problems will worsen in the face of
``declining defense budgets and the erosion of high technology
industry in the United States,'' Shaw said.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the subcommittee, said
the United States in this century has ``convincingly demonstrated
our superior science and engineering capabilities.''
   ``Maintaining that lead will require us to change our thinking
and approach in some key areas. We cannot legislate this change,
but we may have to change the legislation to achieve our goals,''
Bingaman said.
   The Pentagon now spends about $9 billion a year on a variety of
technology programs, including research, exploratory development
and advanced demonstration.
   The laboratories where some of the research is conducted are
government-owned, and ``there has been a continuing and, in recent
years, rising concern that they are inefficient, ineffective,
self-serving and duplicative of industry work, and increasingly
hampered in doing their jobs by the conditions of being part of the
government,'' the report said.
   Specifically, the report found it takes the Pentagon longer to
translate lab advances in the laboratory into fielded military
systems. That conclusion echoes previous findings by other studies
of how the Pentagon builds weapons.
   The report also found that a large amount of technology often
comes from industries that sell to both military and civilian
customers.
   In many instances, these ``dual-use industries'' are
international, a situation that creates tough competition for U.S.
companies and makes the United States more dependent on foreign
supplies, the study found.
   ``U.S. leadership in high-technology industries that are vital
to defense is eroding in the face of strong international
competition,'' the report said.
   Another problem is the myriad of government rules and laws
limiting the ability of the Pentagon to develop technology, the
report said. Congress enacted the laws to prevent abuses, but the
vast number have made the technology system ``slow, cumbersome and
inefficient.''
   Congress should decide if the office of the secretary of defense
should have greater oversight of the technology programs, or
whether the services should act independently, the report said.
   In a related development, a study by the Center for Strategic
and International Studies released Monday found that almost 100,000
companies stopped doing business with the Pentagon over a five-year
period despite an increase in the defense budget.
   The report found that in 1982, more than 138,000 companies
provided goods to the Defense Department. But by 1987, the number
dropped to less than 40,000.
   ``Some of the 80,000 went out of business, including about
20,000 small businesses,'' the report said. ``Most of the 80,000
firms, however, simply quit doing business with the Defense
Department and opted for other customers.''
   The report described the drop-off as ``remarkable'' in light of
the increase in the defense procurement budget from $54.9 billion
to $87 billion in constant fiscal 1989 dollars.
   The study attributed the decline to predatory pricing tactics
used by the larger companies. In some instances, those companies
lowered prices below marginal costs, making it impossible for the
smaller companies to compete.
   In addition, the report found that in comparison to other
industries, ``defense is not a highly profitable business.''
   CSIS is a private, non-profit think tank which issues studies on
a variety of national security issues.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping shook
hands today and normalized relations between the two Communist
giants while outside their meeting hall hundreds of thousands of
people chanted for democratic reform.
   ``We can take this opportunity to publicly announce the
normalization of Sino-Soviet relations'' after 30 years, Deng said
to applause from Soviet and Chinese participants in the meeting.
   The 84-year-old senior Chinese leader welcomed Gorbachev in the
red-carpeted Eastern Hall of the Great Hall of the People as
``comrade'' but did not give him the bear hug he reserves for close
friends and allies.
   In the opening minutes of their 2{-hour meeting, he told the
58-year-old Soviet president that the world's ``key political
problems'' have arisen from Soviet-American Cold War tensions.
   That confrontation, he said, had helped prevent Sino-Soviet
reconciliation but now ``there may be a turning point in
competition'' between the two superpowers and ``the situation is
changing from confrontation to dialogue.'' The United States and
China normalized relations in 1979.
   Outside in Tiananmen Square, hundreds of thousands of students,
teachers, journalists, workers and onlookers reminded the leaders
of momentous change of another sort.
   The students, who consider Gorbachev a hero for the political
reforms he has championed at home, issued appeals for him to take
up their cause for democratic reforms with China's leaders.
   Their four-day occupation of the square, China's symbolic center
of power, forced officials to move an official welcoming ceremony
for Gorbachev on Monday as he arrived for a four-day visit.
   A planned wreath-laying ceremony was canceled today and the
protesters later surrounded the Great Hall, halting traffic and
forcing Gorbachev's afternoon meeting with Premier Li Peng to be
moved to a guest house several miles away. More than 3,000 students
have staged a hunger strike on the square since Saturday.
   One of the student demands is that Deng, the architect of
China's economic reforms, step aside. They characterize Deng as a
dictator who has served too long and is too old to understand the
urgency for political reform.
   But in a meeting with Gorbachev, Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang launched into an unusual defense of Deng,
saying the party still needs his ``wisdom and experience.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted Li Peng as telling the
Soviet leader: ``China needs a peaceful environment externally and
a stable environment internally. Only thus can we accomplish''
modernization.
   ``We do not think that liberty, democracy and human rights are
patent of capitalist countries,'' the premier said, adding that
``China is prepared to perfect these aspects in its pursuit of
political reform.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Deng and Gorbachev
did not discuss the student demonstrations.
   He said Gorbachev acknowledged that the Soviet Union had made
``some errors'' in past dealings with China but the two leaders
agreed ``that bygones are bygones. What is important is to look
forward and do more tangible things.''
   Li said the two leaders discussed Cambodia, where Moscow-backed
Vietnamese troops are fighting Beijing-backed resistance forces.
``They shared some views but did not reach complete agreement,'' he
said.
   The Gorbachev-Deng summit brought together Soviet and Chinese
leaders for the first time since a frosty encounter between Nikita
Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung in 1959.
   Relations have since been marred by ideological rivalry, a 1969
border war and strong Chinese opposition to Soviet policy in
Afghanistan and Cambodia.
   Deng said the summit signified the normalization of relations
between not just the countries but their Communist parties, which
had split over Chinese complaints of Soviet revisionism in the thaw
following Stalin's death.
   He also praised Gorbachev's 1986 speech in the Siberian city of
Vladivostok in which the Soviet leader appealed for an end to
Chinese-Soviet hostility.
   ``All the world and myself could see new content in your policy.
Before that we didn't have a new way of thinking,'' Deng said.
   Gorbachev responded, ``Before that we did not have a new
political order.''
   He said it had taken three years since for a summit to take
place, ``one year for each obstacle.''
   The Chinese have long said there were three obstacles to better
relations with Moscow _ the Soviet military presence in
Afghanistan, Soviet troop deployment along the Chinese border and
Kremlin support of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.
   The Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan in February and
Gorbachev has announced that Soviet forces in Asia will be reduced
by 200,000. In addition, the Vietnamese have promised to pull out
of Vietnam by the end of September.
   Premier Li, who spent six years studying engineering in the
Soviet Union in the 1950s, spoke briefly with Gorbachev in Russian
at the beginning of their meeting today. He stressed that relations
between the two powers ``have been raised to a new high and entered
a new stage.''
   Deng played host to Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, at a lunch.
   Student activists, whose month-long protests have posed the most
serious challenge yet to China's Communist leaders, are demanding
that the government recognize their independent unions and open up
a dialogue on such issues as allowing a free press and ending
official corruption.
   Gorbachev's government has encouraged greater freedom of
expression at home and has faced mass demonstrations in recent
months, even ethnic violence.

<TEXT>
   Not a necktie was in sight at a
street celebration of Carlos Menem's victory and for good reason _
the charismatic president-elect has his roots and support in the
working class.
   Menem's rapport with factory workers, gauchos _ cowboys from
Argentina's rich pampas _ and others helped return the Peronist
Party to power 13 years after it was overthrown in a military coup.
   Truck driver Alejandro Galindez, 27, who joined thousands of
other Peronists in the streets after Menem's election on Sunday,
said the victory ``is a return to our roots.''
   Menem defeated Eduardo Angeloz of the governing party by 7.8
million to 6.1 million votes, or 47.3 percent to 36.9 percent.
   The Peronist Party also won 67 seats in the Chamber of Deputies
to give it 127 overall, or exactly one half; and one Senate seat to
give it 23, also exactly a half. The party controls 17 of 22
provincial governorships.
   President Raul Alfonsin, meanwhile, rejected resignation offers
from his Cabinet today and said he wants to meet Menem as soon as
possible to discuss an orderly transition.
   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez said the eight
ministers met with Alfonsin for 2{ hours this morning.
   He said they did not consider advancing the date of Menem's
inauguration, now set for Dec. 10.
   In his victory speech, Menem called for ``national unity'' and
urged ``the forces of production, businessmen, farmers, workers,
everyone,'' to put aside differences and ``set the country in
motion.''
   He also pledged an end to ``the Argentina where some live well
doing nothing and others live badly although they work all day.''
   The 58-year-old governor of tiny La Rioja province faces severe
economic problems when he takes over from the Radical Civic Union.
   Until then, the Radicals and Peronists must work together. But
that will be difficult given their conflicting views.
   Alfonsin has tried to balance the budget, which is deep in the
red, by selling off state businesses. Menem's preference is to make
the companies more efficient but keep them in state hands.
   The Peronists have demanded increases in both the minimum wage
and federal aid to the provinces. Alfonsin has tried to hold the
line on each.
   Menem specifically has said he will not press Alfonsin to step
down early, but he's eager to take power. In Catamarca Province,
where he attended a rally on Monday, he said, ``We don't want to
keep administering the crisis. We want to confront it and smash
it.''
   Since February, the austral has been devalued by 84 percent,
inflation and interest rates soared to near record levels, wages
shrunk, Central Bank reserves dried up and workers were laid off.
   The foreign debt stands at $59 billion.
   Alfonsin has been widely praised for helping democracy return to
Argentina after the brutal 1976-83 military dictatorship but
refuses to step down early.
   He has said he is looking forward to Argentina's first transfer
of power to a freely elected successor in 61 years.
   Menem is a lawyer, but he looks more like a 19th century
caudillo, with his his shoulder-length hair and muttonchop
sideburns.
   The politician, who likes to drive race cars and be photographed
with showgirls, was born and raised in La Rioja, a poor, arid and
sparsely populated province of 200,000 people about 700 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires.
   The region's principal products are olives, grapes and jojoba.
   The son of Syrian immigrants who came to Argentina early in the
century and built a prosperous vinyard and winery, Menem was
educated in provincial public schools.
   Graduating from law school in 1955, one of his first cases was
the defense of Peronists arrested following the military ouster of
party founder Juan Peron in September 1955.
   Although the Peronist party was barred from political activity,
Menem's law office quickly became a provincial Peronist meeting
place and he was arrested for participation in a political
demonstration.
   A natural showman, Menem's star rose rapidly and after almost
two decades of work with the party, he was elected to the first of
his three terms as governor of La Rioja in 1973.
   Although his parents were Moslems, Menem converted in 1964 to
Roman Catholicism, the religion of most Argentines and required by
the constitution for all presidents. His wife, Zulema, also of
Syrian origin, has said she prefers to remain a Moslem.
   ``It's easy for me to communicate with people,'' Menem has said.
``I talk with everyone. I feel at home in the most humble places.''

<HEAD>Absenteeism Projections Based on Race, Gender, Age Inaccurate: Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers who project worker absenteeism
through race, gender or age comparisons are making invalid
assumptions as well as discriminating, a researcher said Tuesday in
releasing a study that said employees who smoke or drink don't miss
work more than those who don't.
   While simple comparisons of the absentee rates of men and women,
for example, would show women miss work slightly more than men, a
variety of other variables make such information useless to an
employer trying to determine if a given job applicant is likely to
have a poor attendance record, said the study by the National
Chamber Foundation, the research arm of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``Simply because an individual is a member of a group _ women,
minorities, consumers of alcohol, consumers of tobacco _ simply
because you can look at the average incidence of absence among
those groups tells you nothing about the particular behavior of
individuals in those groups,'' study director Carlos E. Bonilla
said.
   Even when a number of variables about a job applicant are
considered, the foundation said, there is still no statistically
supportable formula that would allow employers to identify
applicants who pose a risk of high absenteeism.
   Instead, employers should rely on their subjective opinion of
applicants and, if possible, conduct thorough background checks
including references from former employers. The latter task has
become increasingly difficult in recent years because employers are
hesitant to provide adverse information about former workers out of
a fear of lawsuits, even if the information conveyed is accurate.
   While smoking and drinking cannot be statistically associated
with absenteeism, physical activity did prove to be a significant
factor, the study said.
   ``More physically fit individuals experience fewer work
absenteeism, and employer initiatives that increase the level of
physical activity among the work force may indeed have a positive
effect on employee absenteeism,'' it said.
   The foundation based its results on 33,000 responses to surveys
conducted in 1983 and 1985 by the federal government's National
Center for Health Statistics. All of the respondents included in
the study were 18 years of age or older and had jobs.
   The study was released a week after the center, using some of
the same data, released a study of its own saying sickness keeps
women away from work about one day more a year than men. While the
authors of that report gave no reason for their finding, a 1985
Labor Department study said women have higher rates of absenteeism
in their childbearing years.
   The foundation did not dispute those findings, saying that when
gender was the only variable in determining absenteeism women were
more likely to miss work than men.
   In other single-variable comparisons, the study found the
probability of work loss:
   _Dropped with increases in age.
   _Dropped as education levels rose.
   _Was higher among married workers.
   _Was lower among non-whites.
   _Was lower as family income increased.
   Bonilla said those variables were chosen because such
information is readily available to employers when considering job
applicants. But no variable by itself can provide anything more
than a generalization about a given group and that generalization
cannot be projected to an individual applicant, he said.
   ``The conventional wisdom, based on broad aggregations of
individuals, is inappropriate for use in evaluating the work loss
behavior of a particular applicant,'' the report said.
   Even if all of an individual's traits were combined, no
clear-cut trends relating to absenteeism develop, Bonilla said.
   ``In reality, groups defy objective comparison,'' Bonilla said.
   Of three lifestyle characteristics examined by the study _
smoking, drinking and physical activity _ only physical activity
was found to have a statistically significant impact on work
attendance.
   The chamber group said employers who took an applicant's race,
gender or age into account when trying to determine likely work
attendance, a key variable in profitability, not only would be
violating anti-discrimination laws but also would be using a faulty
theory that ``may very well deprive the employer of well qualified
employees.''

<TEXT>
   Whether it is called Pima cotton or extra-long
staple cotton, the fiber ELS is a rapidly growing crop that is
demanding top prices from discriminating textile manufacturers
around the world.
   In the United States, market prices for ELS have been high
enough the last two years so that the Agriculture Department hasn't
had to make ``deficiency payments'' to growers.
   For example, last week the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service announced the average market
price for ELS cotton was $1.15 per pound. The target price for 1988
ELS was 95.7 cents per pound, meaning growers won't get any price
subsidies.
   Upland cotton, which accounts for most U.S. production, averaged
56.5 cents per pound last year, well below the 1988 upland target
of 75.9 cents _ which meant millions of dollars in deficiency
payments to farmers.
   The USDA generally calls it ELS but notes that American Pima is
the better-known name. Everyone agrees that Pima, or ELS, is a
special kind of cotton having a fiber lint measuring generally
1-3@8 inches to 1-3@4 inches long. The International Cotton
Advisory Committee traditionally defines extra-long staple as 1-3@8
inches or longer.
   From a total cotton production standpoint, ELS is puny. The U.S.
cotton harvest last year was about 15.4 million bales, with more
than 15 million bales of that comprised of upland cotton, the
shorter-staple fiber that is grown commercially in at least 17
states from Georgia to California.
   But the 338,200 bales of ELS cotton in 1988 was a record output.
And another increase is expected this year. In 1983, U.S.
production was 94,700 bales.
   A report by Priscilla A. Andrew of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service says there are a number of ELS varieties grown
in the world, including American Pima, Egyptian Giza, Sudanese
Barakat, Peruvian, Israeli Pima and Indian, as well as some in
China and the Soviet Union.
   This year, according to a recent survey, ELS growers plan to
boost plantings sharply again to 291,000 acres from 187,400 acres
in 1988.
   Arizona is the biggest ELS producer, followed by Texas and New
Mexico. But it is also being introduced into the San Joaquin Valley
area of California.
   On a global basis, the report said, Egypt is the biggest
producer of long and extra-long staple cotton, considered by some
to be the finest in the world. Most of the world's supply of ELS is
used in yarns requiring high strength and fineness.
   ``It is used primarily in high quality sewing thread, fine
broadcloths and specialty yarns for lace and knitted goods,'' the
report said. ``ELS is also used in products to enhance their
appearance and feel.''
   For example, the report said, ELS can be used in dress shirts
and sheets and towels where ``a luxurious feel and appearance plus
durability and strength are desirable.'' Most of the world's ELS
exports go to Europe and the Far East.
   The first ELS cotton was introduced into the United States in
1786 from seed received from the Bahamas. It was called Sea Island
cotton and was ``the finest, longest and most valuable cotton grown
in the world,'' the report said. Production was confined to the
coastal lowlands of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
   Always commanding premium prices, Sea Island cotton sold for as
much as $1.10 to $1.25 per pound in 1825, when upland cotton was
selling for 9 to 25 cents, the report said. It was produced for
export only, with most going to Europe.
   But by 1924, the destructive boll weevil had taken its toll and
Sea Island cotton had died out.
   The first commercial strains of ELS appeared in the United
States about 1912. During World War I, ELS was needed for
airplanes, balloon cloth and machine belts, where high tensile
strength was essential.
   Egyptian cotton failed in the old Cotton Belt because of the
short growing season, the report said. Consequently, experimental
farms were located in Arizona on the Gila Indian reservation of the
Pima tribe. Pima cotton became one of Arizona's most important
crops.

   Private exporting companies have told the
Agriculture Department that the Soviet Union has bought an
additional 450,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year
under a long-term supply agreement.
   The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Officials said Monday the latest sales boosted total U.S. corn
and wheat sales to the Soviets in 1988-89 to a record level of
nearly 19.9 million tons, including more than 15.5 million tons of
corn and 4.31 million tons of wheat.
   Additionally, sales include 443,400 tons of soybeans, 1.37
million tons of soybean meal and 807,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 450,000 tons of
corn would be about 17.7 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.58 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
the latest sale could have a farm value of around $46 million.
   Wheat sales to the Soviet Union have been subsidized under the
department's Export Enhancement Program. But the corn and other
commodities are not subsidized.

   Pedro Rodriguez fondly remembers the fun he
had as a kid watching Mexican plays and feature films at the
Guadalupe Theater, which in its heyday during the 1940s and '50s
served as the anchor for Mexican art and entertainment in the city.
   Today, Rodriguez still has fun as executive director of the
Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, a non-profit organization that not
only runs the restored 410-seat theater, but sponsors literary,
theatrical, musical, dance, painting and visual arts workshops and
shows to preserve Mexican culture.
   With grants from the city and federal governments and
corporations, the center already has the nation's largest
curriculum devoted to development and preservation of Mexican
cultural arts, and operates on a $1 million annual budget.
   ``Were it not for the fact that the Mexican culture itself is
very strong here, the cultural arts would not have survived, but it
just barely did and I think the creation of this institution is
very timely,'' said Rodriguez, a former university professor who
took over the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center in 1983, a year after
it was formed.
   ``Now, we have hundreds of artists yearly that we support
directly through contracts and through the training that we provide
for about 900 students per year and the art and cultural events
throughout the community.''
   But the center hopes to preserve more than just cultural arts;
it also hopes to improve the area's social and economic environment.
   The center and the Avenida Guadalupe Development Association, a
non-profit economic development agency, are transforming a
three-block area around the Guadalupe Theater from a dilapidated
barrio dominated by bars and shacks to a medical, retail and
entertainment showplace that will serve one of the city's oldest
Hispanic neighborhoods.
   ``I think all this construction and all the changes are going to
help everyone here,'' said 48-year-old Roger Mercado, a lifelong
resident of the Guadalupe area. ``I think all the art coming out of
here also will help us communicate with the rest of the community.''
   The Guadalupe Theater, opened in the 1939, served as host for
hundreds of Spanish-language plays and movie premieres until it
fell into disrepair in the early '70s. In 1979, performing and
visual arts groups banded together to better secure funding for
Hispanic arts. By 1982, the group was known as the Guadalupe
Cultural Arts Center. A year later, the city provided $1 million
for renovation of the Guadalupe Theater, which by then was being
used as a flea market.
   Rodriguez said the center's 17-member staff has had to use all
types of marketing techniques to attract not only those in the
neighborhood, but many non-Hispanics who are weary of traveling to
an area surrounded by housing projects.
   ``There is a certain image about coming to this side of town
that we have to get people past, and that was that it was not safe
to come over here. But that's not true. Once they get over here, we
know we have them hooked, and I think everyone in the community is
pretty proud of what is happening here,'' Rodriquez said.
   The Guadalupe Theater now holds art exhibitions in its foyer
gallery, brings in foreign and artistic films and is home to the an
Antonio CineFestival, a Hispanic film festival in its 13th year.
Its other major event is the Tejano Conjunto Festival, a four-day
event now in its eighth year, which will bring in hundreds of
artists and thousands of spectators to hear accordian-playing
musicians.
   The theater also is home to the Theatre Arts Program, which
produces up to four bilingual plays a year through its resident
company, Los Actores de San Antonio, the Actors of San Antonio.
   The center's visual arts program annually sponsors about nine
exhibits, with emphasis on Hispanic and Native American artists. In
the summer, it provides a free, weekly outdoor film festival in
Guadalupe Plaza.
   The center's literature program offers poetry and fiction
readings and annually sponsors a bookfair. This year's major
presenters are Pulitzer Prize winner Alice Walker (``The Color
Purple''), and Mexican poet Octavio Paz.
   Classes for adults and children are offered in all the various
arts programs at the center and 15 other locations across the city.
   ``We work out of very makeshift kinds of situations. The only
thing that we do have that is first-rate is the theater, but
everything else that we do, we do on a shoestring and in poor
conditions,'' Rodriguez said.
   ``But our vision centers around the creation of an institution
that will be anchored in bedrock, here to stay forever, to provide
services so the Mexican arts culture continues to subsist and
flourish.''
   There are plans for a 50,000-square-foot classroom and office
building next to the theater. Rodriquez also envisions use of the
former Progreso Theater, across the street from the Guadalupe, as a
rehearsal and reception hall.
   Those developments would add to area renovations by the
development association, which built Guadalupe Plaza and plans to
open a 48-stall Mexican market later this spring. A private drug
store and medical complex already are operating next to the plaza.
   The Avenida Guadalupe Development Association has spent $7.5
million in the past decade renovating three city blocks surrounding
the Guadalupe Theater.
   ``This neighborhood was one of the pride and joys of San
Antonio, but because of demographic and social changes it began to
deteriorate in the 1960s and '70s,'' said David Garza, executive
director of the development agency.
   ``We are just trying to revitalize the area and change the
conditions of the neighorhood to attract the businesses and the
families, or otherwise we are going to see this neighborhood die
away,'' Garza said.

<TEXT>
   A Christmas stocking decoration and a pacifier
holder that could pose choking hazards for children are being
recalled, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Tuesday.
   Neither has been involved in any injuries, officials said.
   The recall covers about 3,600 ``Mother's Helper'' pacifier
holders sold nationwide from October 1987 to August 1988, the
agency said.
   The recalled pacifier holders have a metal clip for fastening
the device to an infant's clothing. The metal clip could pose the
choking hazard if it separated from the rest of the holder, the
commission said.
   Embossed on the back are the words ``Mother's Helper 1986 Steven
Barrie &amp; Company.'' Consumers should return the holders to the
store where purchased for a refund or send them to Steven Barrie &amp;
Co., 1055A Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa., 18970.
   The second recall involves a Christmas stocking decorated with a
Teddy Bear and two small bells. The bells could come loose and
choke a child, the commission said.
   About 4,400 of the stockings, made of red and white furry
material and topped with the Teddy Bear head, were sold last
Christmas season, officials said.
   These can be returned to the retailer for a refund, the
commission said. Consumers may contact the Jerry Elsner Company,
Bronx, N.Y., at 1-800-223-4119 for additional information.

   A prosecutor today urged an all-white jury
to convict a former Ku Klux Klansman of murder for providing the
rope used to hang the body of a young black man from a tree after a
Klan slaying.
   ``He had been murdered for a horribly simple reason _ he was
black,'' said District Attorney Chris Galanos.
   Galanos' statement came in opening statements in the murder
trial of Benjamin Franklin Cox, 27. He is accused of being an
accomplice in the 1981 beating and strangulation death of Michael
Donald, a 19-year-old black who was picked at random for abduction
and killed. Donald's body was strung up in a tree.
   Attorneys for Cox, a truck driver, struck all 21 blacks among
the 60 prospective jurors Monday.
   Two other Klansmen already are serving prison sentences in the
slaying as a result of an FBI investigation that led to the first
arrests in 1983.
   The killing led to a $7 million jury verdict in 1987 against the
United Klans of America, the nation's biggest Klan organization.
The victim's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, was awarded Klan property
in Tuscaloosa. She died last year.
   Galanos described a Klan meeting in Mobile two nights before the
Donald killing, saying the white supremacist group discussed
``killing a nigger.'' The district attorney apologized for the
language but said it would reappear in the trial.
   Defense attorney Neil Hanley urged the jury to judge Cox as an
individual, not as a former member of the hooded empire. The lawyer
said the state's entire case is ``Klan, Klan, Klan.''
   The murder charge against Cox does not include the possibility
of a death sentence.
   Cox's brother-in-law, Henry Francis Hays, was convicted of
capital murder in 1983 and sentenced to death. That conviction is
on appeal. James ``Tiger'' Knowles pleaded guilty in federal court
to violating Donald's civil rights. He was sentenced to life in
prison in a plea bargain that required his testimony against Hays,
and Cox.
   Cox was indicted in 1985 for murder conspiracy, but that charge
was dropped because the legal deadline to bring the charge had
expired. He was tried last year on a murder charge, and that
proceeding ended in a mistrial when Cox's co-defendant, Bennie Jack
Hays, collapsed in front of the jury.
   Bennie Hays, the 72-year-old father of Henry Hays, is expected
to be tried later.
   Donald was picked at random off a Mobile street at night and
killed to show Klan strength in Alabama in an act of revenge after
a jury did not convict a black defendant in the killing of a white
policeman, according to testimony.

   A helicopter filming an American
action movie crashed and exploded today, killing three Americans
and the Filipino pilot and injuring up to 10 other people,
officials said.
   Two of the injured, both American stuntmen, were in critical
condition, doctors and members of the film crew said. Two other
American stuntmen were seriously hurt but were not in
life-threatening condition, doctors said.
   Police investigator Jaime Talay said the Dolphin helicopter
crashed at the foot of a hill near a mansion once owned by former
President Ferdinand Marcos in Tagaytay, a mountain resort city 30
miles south of Manila.
   Talay said the helicopter was filming a scene for the movie
``Delta Force 2,'' starring American actor Chuck Norris, when the
accident occurred.
   Talay said the scene called for the helicopter to catch fire,
and it took several moments before the crew on the ground realized
the crash was real.
   A fire truck was stationed near the scene during the filming and
helped extinguish the blaze, Talay said.
   Talay identified the three dead Americans as Don Marshall, Mike
Graham and Gaddi Dansig. Marshall and Graham were electricians and
Dansig was a cameraman, according to members of the crew.
   The Filipino pilot, Jojo Imperial, died a few hours after the
crash in a local hospital, officials said.
   A nurse at a hospital in nearby Dasmarinas said up to 10 people
were brought there with injuries but most were minor. Doctors at
the hospital, speaking on condition they not be named, said two of
the injured were in critical condition. Two others were seriously
injured but were not in life-threatening situations.
   All four were American stuntmen, crew members said.
   One crew member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
helicopter had just taken off in preparation for taping a scene
when it suddenly veered to the left and plunged into a 40-foot
ravine next to the former Marcos mansion.
   The accident was the second involving a Norris film in the
Philippines.
   In 1987, a Philippine military Sikorsky helicopter rented by
Norris' crew crashed in Manila Bay, killing three Filipino soldiers
who had been working as extras.
   The 1987 crash took place while Norris was filming ``Missing In
Action, Part III _ Braddock.''

<HEAD>Dallas Series May Not Film In Dallas For Upcoming Season</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southfork just won't be the same.
   Lorimar Productions will not shoot any of the first 12 episodes
of the 1989 season of ``Dallas'' in its namesake city, spokesman
David Stapf said Monday.
   ``They're not planning to come down at the usual time to shoot
the first 12 episodes,'' Stapf said. ``No decision has been made
for the entire year.''
   The standard number of episodes is 22, said a spokesman for CBS,
which broadcasts the show.
   The city could lose as much as $5 million if ``Dallas'' stays
away from the city for the entire season, said Joe Pope, whose
Dallas-based Film Productions Services company has provided crews
and equipment for the series' annual two-month summer shoot in the
Dallas area.
   ``From my own company, we bill more than $1 million every
year,'' Pope said. ``It means a lot. It's like being told you're
not going to see a good friend again.''
   ``It's more than economic, it's emotional,'' Pope said. ``Up
until last week, I was under the assumption they were coming in.
They couldn't justify it (the expense) anymore.''
   After last year's strike by the Writers Guild of America,
producer Leonard Katzman delayed filming in the city until last
fall.
   The first scene filmed in Dallas was Feb. 2, 1978, two months
before the show premiered.
   ``Dallas'' will be aired for at least one more season, but the
show's ratings have been steadily declining since the high-water
point in the 1983-84 season when it was prime time's most popular
attraction.
   The show's annual season-ending cliffhanger episode will be
broadcast Friday.

   Tropical storm Brenda gained strength
as it neared the central Philippines on Tuesday, forcing
authorities to post storm warnings in 20 provinces and stop six
ships from leaving Manila.
   Brenda, packing winds of 53 mph, was about 270 miles southeast
of the town of Borongan on Samar island, about 370 miles southeast
of Manila. It was moving west-northwest at 9 mph.
   If Brenda maintains its present speed, it will hit Leyte island
Wednesday with gusts of up to 63 mph, weather officials said.
   The Philippine coast guard station in Manila kept six commercial
ships in port. In October, the passenger ship Dona Marilyn sank in

   A Cuban family denied re-entry to this
country since a Christmastime trip to Canada for a better view of
Niagara Falls returned to the United States today, hopeful of
rebuilding their life in Florida.
   ``I feel like I have been born again,'' Carlos Fajardo said
after clearing Customs in Buffalo. ``I have no bitterness. I am
thankful for the people who helped us and looking forward to
returning home.''
   Fajardo's wife, Bermaida, leaped out of their car after passing
through a border checkpoint. She shouted and embraced her children
and a friend.
   ``I have no words to describe how happy I feel,'' Mrs. Fajardo
said.
   Members of the Cuban family received word Monday that U.S.
immigration officials had granted them political asylum. The move
ends a bureaucratic nightmare that began last Christmas when the
family crossed into Canada on a sightseeing trip.
   ``They're absolutely elated,'' said Sister Kathleen Rimar, the
family's attorney. ``Yet they realize that they'll have to start
all over again.''
   U.S. immigration officials announced Monday that the family had
been granted political asylum.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida, and her two children, Yoradlys and
Yoandys, were on a vacation and had traveled north to see snow.
   They said they crossed the Rainbow Bridge into Ontario on Dec.
23 to get a better view of the falls. They were denied re-entry to
the United States because they lacked proof of citizenship.
   Later, immigration officials determined the family had a history
of immigration fraud. Benedict Ferro, district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, was adamant about not
letting the family return, saying to do so would be an affront to
millions of people waiting to enter lawfully.
   Fajardo's request for a humanitarian parole was rejected by
Ferro in March.
   Meantime, members of Miami's Hispanic community and Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., appealed to the INS on behalf of the family, saying
they were responsible members of the community who owned a home and
a business.
   The children, ages 9 and 12, attended school in Miami.
   After an application for asylum and subsequent INS
investigation, Ferro said he could overlook the history of fraud
because they had a legitimate fear of being persecuted if they
returned to Cuba.
   ``But it's not without mixed feelings that we're allowing them
back,'' Ferro said. ``There was some blatant fraud involved.''
   INS officials said Fajardo's wife used phony documents to enter
the country illegally in 1985. She and the two children from
another marriage were ordered deported by an immigration judge in
August.
   Sister Rimar, a Catholic Charities worker, said she thought INS
officials had tried to make an example of the Fajardos.
   ``I think they could have allowed them back a lot sooner,'' she
said.
   The family apparently has lost their home, car and boat-building
business during the five months in Canada, where they subsisted on
charity.

daring call for a union free of government control. Eight
newspapers and the Xinhua News Agency also joined in, demanding a
free press and an end to censorship.
   Reporters from the China Central Television Station marched and
said they wanted Ai Zhisheng to resign as minister of Radio, Film
and Television.
   ``He stops us from reporting the news, kick him out,'' said one
reporter. ``I don't care if I lose my job. How can I return to the
old ways now that I feel we are so close to freedom.''
   Composers and singers from the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe
also played their role, fighting what they said was the death of
Chinese culture.
   ``The leaders told us not to come out today but we had to,''
said one composer. ``Any Chinese person with any conscience is out
today. Those students are dying for democracy and the government is
doing nothing.''
   Several hundred high school students tagged along. ``In two
years, we will become you,'' read their banner.
   The protest by an estimated 300,000 people, which ringed
Tiananmen in a sea of banners, was unprecedented and marked the
high point of more than one month of demonstrations led by an
increasingly powerful student movement that wants a freer and more
democratic China.
   The last time workers came out in force was April 27 when
thousands of laborers pushed and shoved their way through lines of
unarmed police, opening a way for marching students.
   But Tuesday, they came to pay their respects at Tiananmen Square
where more than 3,000 increasingly weak students have been on a
hunger strike for three days. And, unlike last time, they
identified themselves with the huge red and white banners that have
become a hallmark of these demonstrations.
   ``Government _ how long will you allow the students to starve?''
read a banner carried by journalists of the conservative state-run
Guangming Daily.
   ``We won't be silent anymore,'' read another, sported by labor
union officials.
   The students were moved by the march.
   ``Mama, I can't come home when all these people are here for
us,'' said a young woman, weeping into a public telephone. ``They
are wonderful.''
   The students are demanding the government recognize their
independent student union and conduct a dialogue about democratic
reforms.
   Tuesday's demonstration highlighted the role students play as
instigators of change in China's modern history.
   Ever since May 4, 1919, when Beijing students marched against
concessions made to the Japanese after World War I and began the
May Fourth Movement, Chinese have looked to the students for
inspiration.
   ``The students dare to speak and to act,'' said a miner, one of
600 who marched to the square. ``They are the spark. We are the
fire.''
   ``Talk to the students! Talk to the students!'' chanted a group
of engineers and oil riggers from the Ministry of Petroleum.
   The ministry was one of several government bureaus, including
the Seismological Institute and the Ministry of Aeronautics and
Astronautics Industry, represented in the march.
   Government officials said they did not care about punishment.
   ``Punish me and my comrades,'' said one official at the
aeronautics ministry. ``And then punish the rest of the country.
Those old methods don't work.''
   Pan Kang and about 200 high school teachers from Hebei province
traveled about 140 miles by train to Beijing. ``We heard about the
students fasting in the square,'' he said. ``They are speaking for
us and suffering for us. We had to express our support.''
   About 160 doctors from two hospitals bicycled to the square to
express their concern. ``These children worry me. I think of them
as my own,'' said a bespectacled doctor in his 50s. ``I don't want
to see any of them sick. But I believe in their struggle.''
   Clothed in a ripped T-shirt, the words ``Democracy'' and
``Freedom'' scrawled on his back, businessman Wang Xiafeng adjusted
his position on the three-wheeled cart and shouted: ``Down with
bureacracy! Down with corruption!''
   The rag-tag Beijing City People's Group, a newly formed protest
group, shouted back.
   ``I am afraid of these people most of all,'' said one passer-by
as the group of mostly jobless youths marched by. ``They are very
angry.''

<TEXT>
   The United States is asking Latin
American nations to withdraw their ambassadors from Panama in a bid
to force the ouster of military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, diplomatic sources say.
   In Washington, administration officials said evacuation flights
from Panama will be offered beginning today to all U.S. military
dependents who wish to leave.
   In Panama, diplomatic sources, who spoke Monday on condition of
anonymity, said Washington is circulating a petition among the
region's leaders in anticipation of an Organization of American
States meeting Wednesday in Washington.
   The OAS meeting was called to discuss the Panama's contest
national elections and the opposition has called for a general
strike in Panama to coincide with the gathering.
   In a communique pubished today, Panama's Labor Ministry declared
the strike illegal because it was inspired by political motives,
not labor issues. The communique did not specify what might happen
to those who take part in the strike.
   A lawmaker on state radio today accused the opposition of timing
the strike to damage Panama's image abroad.
   Rigoberto Paredes, an influential national legislator and
militant Noriega backer, claimed Noriega's departure is not
negotiable.
   He also said the proposed general strike is ``intended to create
disorder in the streets to a degree that the United States can use
it to justify direct physical intervention in Panama.''
   A diplomatic withdrawal would be part of a general condemnation
of the Noriega-backed government, which nullified the May 7
presidential elections.
   International observers have said that opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara clearly won the election. Endara and one of his
running mates were beaten with metal pipes by Noriega supporters
last Wednesday.
   The United States, Venezuela and Mexico have already recalled
their envoys and one diplomatic source said Venezuela would ask the
OAS to demand that the Panamanian government immediately recognize
the results of the elections.
   The opposition is demanding it be declared the winner.
Government candidates have accepted the decision of the Electoral
Tribunal and have refused to make any other public comments.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis left Panama on Monday after
accusing Noriega of ordering his men to try to kill one of the
opposition leaders, second vice presidential candidate Guillermo
Ford, in Wednesday's assault.
   ``I leave Panama with a heavy heart, but with great hope,''
Davis told a news conference before leaving from Howard Air Base, a
U.S. military installation near Panama City. ``The Panamanian
people have repeatedly been victimized by Noriega's brutality. Yet
they are heartened by their election victory.''
   Davis said the attack on Ford during an opposition march ``was
meant to kill''. Endara has been hospitalized with head injuries
but was to be released today.
   Ford called on Monday for the ouster of Noriega and said any
talks with the military over a possible solution must center ``on a
definite point of departure, date and time and flight number '' for
Panama's de facto ruler.
   He also said a solution must include recognition of the
opposition's electoral victory.
   Ford said he agreed that the attack on him was an assassination
attempt, but that he did not know whether Noriega had ordered it,
as Davis asserted.
   The U.S. government has been trying to oust Noriega since he was
indicted by a Florida grand jury in February 1988 on
drug-trafficking charges.
   It accuses him of repression and has called on the Panamanian
Defense Forces to oust him.
   ``Noriega can talk to the United Staes about his problems with
drug charges,'' Ford said. ``But he will have to talk to us about
his problem with us and that's a hell of a big problem.''

   On the eve of a major international conference
on the Panama crisis, U.S. officials believe the position of
military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega has been severely weakened.
   ``He's in trouble,'' said U.S. ambassador Arthur Davis, who
returned home Monday for an indefinite stay as part of a series of
measures taken by President Bush in response to fraud allegations
and violence surrounding last week's Panamanian election.
   Organization of American States foreign ministers meet here on
Wednesday to determine whether a common stand is possible on the
Panamanian situation.
   It will be the first special meeting of OAS foreign ministers
since the Falkland-Malvinas crisis of 1982.
   Meanwhile, the House Foreign Affairs Committee today approved on
a voice vote a resolution condemning Noriega's ``reprehensible
actions'' in thwarting the election and calling on him and the
Panamanian military to recognize Endara as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized Guillermo Endara as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution, which
was expected to be approved later in the day by the full House.
   The statement also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy
steps'' taken by Bush ``as an appropriate and measured response to
the crisis in Panama.''
   Given the international outcry against Noriega's actions, U.S.
officials were cautiously optimistic that a strong stand in the OAS
will be taken.
   Panamanian officials already have indicated that they plan to
try to portray the situation in Panama as the product of U.S.
interventionism. A Noriega-controlled tribunal annulled the
election results last week, claiming outsiders had compromised the
balloting.
   A Panamanian envoy, Carlos Russell, has alleged that the U.S.
government has engaged in economic aggression against Panama and
spent $10 million in support of opposition candidates during the
presidential campaign.
   Davis refused to comment Monday when asked about the allegations.
   At least two dozen countries have spoken out against Noriega
since the returns from the May 7 elections were tossed out amid
charges of fraud and the beating of opposition candidates during an
anti-government demonstration.
   There is no possibility of OAS sanctions against Noriega but
nonetheless, U.S. officials believe an OAS statement condemning
Noriega, combined with his weakened position domestically, could
hasten his eventual departure.
   Davis spoke to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base on Monday
after a flight from Panama. He said there are increasing signs that
Noriega's situation is becoming untenable.
   One is that the government appears to lack the resources to pay
civil service employees, he said. Another is that the nominal head
of government, President Manuel Solis Palma, has disappeared from
public view since the election.
   Before departing from Panama, Davis accused Noriega of directing
an attack on the life of Guillermo Ford, a vice presidential
candidate in the May 7 election.
   After his arrival here, Davis elaborated on his allegation.
   With Ford prostrate on the floor of an automobile and a
bodyguard lying on top of him for protection, a member of an armed
pro-government force known as the Dignity Battalion opened fire
into the vehicle, Davis said. The bodyguard was killed.
   ``You don't put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire at
the people in it unless you're planning to kill somebody,'' Davis
said.
   Asked about the link to Noriega, Davis replied, ``Well, they're
his men. Nobody else ordered it except Noriega. The Dignity
Battalions are under his control.''
   The Dignity Battalions, Davis said, ``have about as much dignity
as a rat.''
   The battalions have been widely portrayed as young unemployed
thugs hired by the Panamanian government but Davis said some were
Panamanian Defense Force personnel in disguise.
   Davis said U.S. officials have photographs showing PDF personnel
changing into Dignity Battalion garb on the day Ford and other
opposition candidates were attacked.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia said Tuesday it has
protested Hungary's decision to halt a joint hydroelectric project
on the Danube River, and it may demand compensation from Budapest.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party newspaper, said Foreign Minister
Jaromir Johanes summoned Hungarian Ambassador Miklos Barity on
Monday to receive the protest. The dispute is the latest indication
of declining relations between the Warsaw Pact allies.
   Gyula Horn, the Hungarian foreign minister, said Monday his
government would examine all environmental implications of the
joint project. Hungary ordered a halt Saturday on its part of the
Nagymaros dam.
   If previously ``unforeseeable ecological consequences'' are
found, Horn said, Hungary reserves the right to renegotiate the
agreement with Czechoslovakia.
   Opposition to the project has grown for months in Hungary, where
unofficial groups are gaining a bigger say in politics.
   Czechoslovakia has given no publicity to possible environmental
problems, which it says those were addressed before the project was
agreed upon in 1977.
   Its part of the project, a dam and power station at Gabcikovo,
40 miles east of Bratislava, is expected to be finished in July.
   Those installations have cost Czechoslovakia about $1.1 billion,
but will not be able to operate as planned without Nagymaros, which
is only about half finished.
   ``This one-sided step by the Hungarian government means a threat
to the whole objective,'' the government protest said.
   ``The decision by the Hungarian government was made without
negotiation. ... This violated the agreed procedure for solving
controversial issues. Therefore the Czechoslovak government insists
that construction should continue.''
   If the Nagymaros dam is not built, it said, Czechoslovakia may
demand compensation under provisions of the 1977 agreements.
   Horn's statement indicated, however, that Hungary would insist
on renegotiating the agreement rather than paying compensation
under the old one.
   Relations became touchy last month after Hungarian television
interviewed Alexander Dubcek, the Czechoslovak Communist Party
chief who led the ``Prague Spring'' liberalization of 1968, which
was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   Hungary ignored Czechoslovak complaints about the first
installment and broadcast the second half of the three-hour
interview April 26.
   Official Soviet bloc media had not interviewed Dubcek since he
was expelled from the party in June 1970 in a purge of nearly half
a million members overseen by Milos Jakes, now the party leader.
   Another irritant is a scheduled visit to Czechoslovakia of
Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian president and party chief. Hungary
is critical of Ceausescu for his treatment of the ethnic Hungarian
minority in Romania and his alleged repression of human rights.

   A white former policeman was found
guilty Tuesday of killing six blacks and an Asian man during a
shooting rampage in downtown Pretoria.
   Barend Strydom also was convicted of killing a black woman at a
squatter camp on Nov. 8, a week before the Pretoria massacre, and
of trying to kill 16 blacks who were wounded in the two incidents.
   Strydom, a member of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
is expected to be sentenced Wednesday. The death penalty is
mandatory for murder in South Africa unless the judge determines
there were extenuating circumstances.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Judge Louis Harms halted the trial after
1{ days of testimony, agreeing with the prosecution that the case
was clear cut.
   ``There is no doubt that he is guilty of all charges,'' Harms
said.
   The judge noted that three state-appointed psychiatrists have
determined Strydom, 23, is not mentally unbalanced.
   In testimony Monday and Tuesday, witnesses described how Strydom
smiled as he strolled along Pretoria sidewalks shooting blacks at
close range.
   According to testimony, the shooting spree took place shortly
after Strydom was rebuffed in an attempt to initiate a love affair
with the wife of a policeman with whom he shared an apartment.
   According to the prosecution, Strydom admitted telephoning a
newspaper on Nov. 14 to say that ``something big'' would happen in
Pretoria the next day. Strydom also allegedly told the newspaper
that he had attended a speech by President P.W. Botha that night
and that he would have killed the South African leader if he had
announced he was freeing jailed black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela.
   In a separate case, seven white men appeared in court Tuesday in
connection with the tarring and feathering of Mayor Gus Gouws of
Welkom, a mining town in the Orange Free State.
   The men, who face assault charges, were arrested immediately
after the Saturday incident in which Gouws was attacked while
helping to open a multiracial marathon race for handicapped people.
   Five of the seven have been identified as members of the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, which seeks to establish a
whites-only state in the northern half of South Africa.

   More than 1,000 workers in this
southeastern city filed suits Tuesday to divorce their wives on the
grounds they can't support a family on their income, a union
official said.
   Musa Celik, head of the Diyarbakir branch of the Yol-Is Trade
Union, said 1,070 workers employed by Turkey's Highway Authority
filed their individual suits in Diyarbakir civil court.
   He said the workers said in a joint petition for divorce their
income ``was not sufficient to provide even the most fundamental
needs of their families and this was causing quarrels and making
the marriage unbearable.''
   Celik said the average monthly wage of the workers was about $70.
   The suits appeared to be part of the union's campaign to bring
attention to its demands to nearly triple salaries at a time
inflation is running at 75 percent. Since the campaign began six
months ago, hundreds of thousands of workers have taken part in
daily protests that include work slowdowns and refusal to work
overtime.
   Obtaining a divorce is difficult in Turkey unless both spouses
agree.

   Riot police blocked a protest Tuesday
by demonstrators angered by the mysterious death of a student at
Kwangju city.
   The death of student Lee Chol-kyu has affected relations with
Washington, as Seoul warned that a State Department official's
remarks about the death could harm relations.
   Police all over the nation were on alert after dissidents called
for demonstrations to mark the anniversary this week of a 1980
uprising in southeastern Kwangju. At least 192 people were killed
in the nine-day rebellion.
   Witnesses said 10,000 students and citizens chanting
anti-government slogans marched in Kwangju on Tuesday to protest
Lee's death.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' they yelled when their
march was blocked by riot police guarding the provincial government
headquarters.
   Thousands of protesters have demonstrated every day in downtown
Kwangju since the radical student's body was found Wednesday in a
reservoir near the city, which is about 170 miles south of Seoul.
   Dissidents allege Lee was tortured to death by police and that
authorities have doctored pathology tests to show that he drowned.
   Students staged street protests in two other provincial cities,
Taejon and Chonju, according to the official Yonhap news agency.
   In Seoul, police fired tear gas Tuesday to disperse about 300
radical students trying to march from Sungkyunkwan University with
firebombs. It was the first violent clash since six policemen died
May 3 in a campus confrontation.
   Many students, sensing public anger at the officers' deaths,
renounced violent tactics.
   The Seoul government said U.S. comments last week on Lee's death
were incorrect.
   ``Unnecessary comment on internal matters, particularly on a
situation in which it does not know the truth, would not be of help
to the U.S.-Korea alliance or friendly relations,'' a Foreign
Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   The warning responded to remarks by a State Department official
who called Lee's death ``a deplorable event.''
   ``We do not know who may have committed this atrocious act,''
the State Department official said, but ``the murderers will be
exposed and severely punished.''
   South Korea lodged a protest in Washington, contending it has
not been proved that Lee was murdered. The State Department said
Monday it did not intend to prejudge how Lee died.
   Police had sought Lee for anti-state acts and prosecutors
believe the student fell into a reservoir and drowned while fleeing
police.
   Dissidents and radical students are trying to use the growing
furor over Lee's death to step up their campaign to topple Roh.
   The opposition-controlled National Assembly convened 16
committees Tuesday to investigate Lee's death and other issues.
Opposition parties contend the government is using radical violence
as a pretext to subdue all opposition groups.
   Roh has ordered a crackdown on the dissidents he accuses of
threatening stability and democracy. The Justice Ministry announced
587 people have been charged or arrested this year for violent
protests and anti-state activities.

   A powerful car bomb exploded in
Syrian-policed west Beirut today, killing the spiritual head of
Lebanon's Sunni Moslem community and 20 other people, police said.
   Police said 46 other people were wounded in the explosion, which
occurred as the Arab League tried to maintain a 6-day-old truce to
halt the latest fighting between Moslem and Christian forces.
   Among the dead was Grand Mufti Hassan Khaled, the Sunni Moslem
religious leader and a prominent voice of moderation who had been
involved in efforts to end the bloodshed.
   The explosion happened at 1 p.m. as Khaled was being driven
through the crowded Aishe Bakkar district from his office to his
home for lunch, a police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules, said
Khaled's driver and three other people riding in his car were
killed. Four Lebanese riot policemen riding in a jeep in front of
Khaled's car also were among the fatalities.
   The bomb-laden car blew up only 100 yards from the home of
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni politician who heads the
Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government. It was not clear where
Hoss was at the time, but one of his bodyguards guarding the
building in which he lives was killed by flying glass and shrapnel.
   Khaled, 68, is survived by a wife and four sons.
   Pools of blood filled the street and Khaled's black Cadillac was
smashed. Police reinforments sealed off the area as ambulances
arrived to evacuate victims.
   The explosion tore off the facade of a four-story apartment
building in front of which the explosives-packed car was parked.
Several other buildings, including a mosque, were wrecked within a
50-yard radius.
   Fire engines rushed to Aishe Bakkar and began dousing dozens of
smoldering cars with water hoses.
   The spokesman said he could not tell whether the bomb-laden car
was detonated by remote control or a timing device. All Beirut
radio stations, however, said the blast was a ``premeditated
assassination.''
   Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted programming to
broadcast news of the explosion.
   When Khaled's death was confirmed, they joined in mourning,
displaying a rare show of unity. Moslem radios broadcast verses
from the Koran, Islam's holy book, and the Christian stations
played somber music.
   It was the sixth car bombing in Lebanon this year. By police
count, 28 people were killed and 218 wounded in the previous blasts.
   Eleven political leaders of the Sunni sect, including three
former prime ministers, held an emergency meeting at Khaled's
headquarters an hour after the explosion. Khaled's four sons also
attended.
   Khaled, the widely respected spiritual guide of Lebanon's
900,000 Sunnis, had publicly advocated Christian-Moslem
co-existence in the tiny Mediterranean nation where the two
communities have been locked in 14 years of civil warfare.
   Lebanon's Sunni Moslem community is smaller and considered more
moderate than the Shiite Moslem majority. Shiite Moslems loyal to
Iran are believed to be holding the 15 Western hostages, including
nine Americans. The Sunnis are believed not to be involved in
hostage-taking.
   Theologically, Shiite and Sunni Moslems differ on the successor
to the prophet Mohammed, and while Sunnis accept the Sunna as the
authoritative supplement to the Koran, Shiites do not.
   During the latest round of bloodshed which erupted March 8,
Khaled made several calls for restraint, stressing that all
problems could be solved through dialogue. He also had declared
supported for Arab League efforts to enforce a cease-fire.
   Shortly before the explosion, police said that about 60 shells
and rockets, fired from Syrian and Druse Moslem positions, had
crashed on a two-mile coastal strip in the Christian heratland
north of Beirut.
   Despite the hostilities, a Museum crossing between the two
sectors of the divided capital was reopened to motorists,
pedestrians and trucked food and fuel supplies after a nine-week
shutdown forced by the fighting.
   Police said today's shelling was aimed at preventing ships
suspected of carrying arms from docking at the Christian ports of
Byblos and Amsheet, about 20 miles north of the capital.
   The Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies have charged that army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000-member Christian army has been
getting arms and ammunition from Iraq through Byblos and Amsheet.
   They declared they would keep on shelling the Christian coast
despite an ``inland truce'' proclaimed by the Arab League on
Thursday to halt two months of artillery duels that wreaked havoc
to Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors.
   No casualties were reported from today's skirmishes. By police
count, 359 people were killed and 1,393 wounded since the fighting
erupted March 8 between Aoun's troops and their Syrian and Druse
foes.

   Nations that profess non-alignment begin
planning their ninth summit Wednesday, but some question whether
the group still has a purpose now that East and West appear to be
getting together.
   The 101-member movement was formed in Yugoslavia in 1961, with
President Tito as a founder, to offer an alternative to the power
blocs led by the United States and Soviet Union. The next summit is
scheduled for September in Yugoslavia.
   Discussions at the three-day meeting to set the summit agenda
are expected to focus on Third World conflicts, mounting foreign
debt, South African racial policies, superpower efforts on arms
reduction and the PLO declaration of an independent Palestinian
state.
   It was scheduled as a meeting of foreign ministers but
conference sources said no more than 30 were expected to attend,
which strengthened the argument by critics that the organization
lacks relevance to international politics.
   President Robert Mugabe is chairman of the non-aligned movement.
   Those who say the movement no longer has a role note that the
superpowers, not the non-aligned nations, were responsible for
recent easing of crises in the Third World: withdrawal of Soviet
forces from Afghanistan and a regional peace pact promising
Namibian independence from South Africa.
   A committee was formed last year to determine why the movement
seems to be stagnating. Its findings and recommendations have not
been revealed.
   An Asian delegate told The Associated Press: ``There's too much
rhetoric and not enough action. The Soviet bloc and the West bloc
get things done without too much talk.''
   Draft recommendations for the foreign ministers and other
delegates to consider include:
   _ Promoting a ban on nuclear weapons tests.
   _ Condemning South Africa for acquiring a nuclear weapons
capability with the alleged help of Western powers and Israel.
   _ Denouncing the West for supporting South Africa
diplomatically, economically and militarily.
   _ Supporting a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
   _ Backing for efforts toward international peace talks on the
Middle East.
   _ Supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization declaration
of an independent state.
   _ Criticizing the United States for ``destabilizing actions and
coercive economic measures'' against Panama.
   Among the first issues up for consideration is a disagreement in
Latin America about efforts by Panama to prevent admission of
Venezuela as a member.
   Panama's delegation accused Venezuela of plotting to overthrow
its government. No details were revealed of the alleged plot
against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, who
commands the military and police.
   Last week, Panama said President Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela had been in touch with Panamanian army officers urging
them to overthrow Noriega.
   The movement's coordinating bureau, meeting in New York in
March, recommended that Venezuela be admitted. A Venezuelan
delegation is expected to attend the Harare meeting.

   The United States government has decided to
offer evacuation flights from Panama to all military dependents who
wish to leave, starting today, administration officials said.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said some dependents
of military servicemen and U.S. Embassy workers already had
departed Panama on ``space available'' seats on military transports
over the last few days.
   But Howard and other officials who asked not to be named said
the Defense Department was now launching a much broader effort,
using chartered commercial planes in addition to the military cargo
planes that have been ferrying extra troops to Panama.
   Howard insisted several times at a briefing the movement of
military dependents was not an ``evacuation,'' but rather ``an
accelerated drawdown.''
   The word evacuation suggests a near-panic withdrawal and that's
not what is happening now in Panama, Howard said.
   The spokesman said he didn't know how frequently flights would
operate and to which cities in the United States they would run.
But a spokesman at the Charleston, S.C., Air Force Base said today
that at least some flights would be using that city as a point of
entry.
   Lt. Lester T. Carroll Jr., the spokesman, said the first of at
least two evacuation flights of dependants from Panama was
scheduled for arrival in Charleston tonight, carrying between 200
and 300 people.
   There are about 14,000 dependents of service personnel and
Defense Department employees living in Panama.
   According to Howard, the Pentagon and the U.S. Southern Command,
which is headquartered in Panama, have decided that all so-called
``command-sponsored'' dependents will either be living inside U.S.
bases or transported home by July 1.
   The Pentagon announced Monday that that all ``command
sponsored'' military families _ those who are there under official
U.S. government sponsorship _ had moved inside U.S. military bases
in Panama under an emergency order.
   But there are not enough houses on the bases for those who had
been living off base _ about 1,396 people _ to stay there
permanently, Howard said. So while the evacuation flights are
currently voluntary, some dependents may face orders to fly home if
not enough volunteer, the spokesman said.
   Of the roughly 14,000 military dependents in Panama, 3,081 live
off base. Of that total, 1,396 are command sponsored and 1,685 are
not. The families who are not command sponsored have been urged to
move to one of the 10 U.S. military installations in Panama, but
cannot be forced to do so.
   Howard said today the flights home were being offered to all
military dependents in Panama, including those who were not
officially ``sponsored'' by the military and had decided on their
own to live there with a husband or wife.
   Howard said the administration wanted to launch its ``drawdown''
because of the difficulty of forecasting the actions of the Noriega
government. Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the strongman behind that
government, staged and then declared void a popular presidential
election a week ago when it became clear his candidate had lost.
   President Bush subsequently ordered almost 2,000 additional
troops to Panama to ensure the safety of American citizens.

   Two West German relief workers who were
freed from captivity 12 days ago were kidnapped again in this
southern port city today, police said.
   They said gunmen in two cars intercepted Heinrich Struebig, 48,
and Petra Schnitzler, 26, as they were on their way from their
center to the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp at 7:30 p.m.
   A police spokesman said the pair were in two cars when the
gunmen firing in the air stopped them and took them away.
   Police could not confirm reports that their colleague, Markus
Quint, 21, who was freed from 10 days in captivity on Sunday, was
with them.
   On May 4, the three relief workers from the private West German
relief grou, ASME-Humanitas, were grabbed by five unidentified
gunmen on Sidon's southern edge, police said.
   Struebig, an administrator, and Schnitzler, a nurse, were
released 10 hours later. They said they were freed so they could
transmit the demands of the kidnappers holding Quint to West German
authorities.
   No one claimed responsibility for the abduction. Nabih Berri,
head of the Shiite Moslem militia called Amal, brought Quint back
to the organization's headquarters Sunday. But he refused to
identify the kidnappers.
   Palestinian security officials in south Lebanon quoted Struebig
and Schnitzler as saying that the kidnappers were demanding a mild
sentence for confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial in Frankfurt, West
Germany, charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 TWA
hijacking during which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   The verdict is scheduled for Wednesday and prosecutors have
demanded a life sentence.
   Struebig and Schnitzler, who also disappeared overnight last
year, had rejected numerous West German government appeals to leave
Lebanon.

<HEAD>Bush, Mitterrand and a Gaggle of Security Agents to Visit Boston
Campus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University's 5,600 seniors are taking a
final lesson in supply and demand, with some scalping tickets to
this weekend's commencement featuring President Bush and France's
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Tickets reportedly are going for as much as $100.
   About 30,000 people _ 10,000 more than usual _ are expected at
the ceremony, for which each senior was allotted four tickets.
   ``We haven't had to use a system like this in the past because
we've been able to accommodate everyone, but the students' response
this year has been overwhelming,'' BU Executive Vice President Jon
Westling said Tuesday.
   For the most part, students say their parents wouldn't dream of
missing graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders in
academic robes collect honorary degrees.
   But for some seniors whose families are small or eagerness to
make a buck is great, the opportunity for a little wheeling and
dealing is attractive.
   ``We think that it would have been preferable for students who
weren't going to be needing tickets to have turned them back so a
fair allocation procedure could have been used,'' Westling said.
``It's a very difficult thing to stop, but it's not something we
encourage or condone.''
   University President John Silber has been credited with
persuading Bush and Mitterrand to converge on the school's urban
campus, thus dominating the keen annual competition among
Massachusetts' 120 colleges for commencement speakers.
   Silber attracted not one, but two world leaders, while Harvard
University had to ``settle'' for Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto and Tufts University for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar.
   ``He extended the invitations, worked with the staff both at the
White House and at the Elysee to make sure that the case for coming
to Boston University was put as clearly and effectively as
possible,'' Westling said. ``And it appears to have worked.''
   BU spokesman Thomas Cashman said Silber was able to arrange the
visit through his friendship with Bush, which dates to his days at
the University of Texas in the 1960s, and his more recent
acquaintance with Mitterrand through Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, a
BU professor and friend of the French head of state.
   The presidents also had plans to meet at Bush's summer retreat
in Kennebunkport, Maine, around graduation day, making a side trip
to Boston convenient.
   While BU's presidential coup has set the community abuzz, ``it's
been a headache'' for campus security, said Adam C. Thermos,
manager of protective services.
   Senior Cindy Carron said she and many of her friends regarded
the presidential visit as a mixed blessing, since it limited the
number of tickets available to students and required extensive
security checks.
   ``I'd almost rather have my whole family there to share in the
ceremony instead of the president, who's untouchable,'' she said.
   Lauren Goldstein, a native of New York, agreed.
   ``It's becoming such a hassle,'' she said. ``That my parents
have to get here at the crack of dawn to get through security is
ludicrous, but unfortunately that's what you have to do when a
president comes to town.''

   A drug dealer was sentenced today to the maximum
term of 25 years to life in prison for the murder of a rookie
policeman, whom President Bush has called a victim of ``cocaine
cowards.''
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas A. Demakos also sentenced
Philip Copeland to five to 15 years for weapons possession, to run
concurrently. The sentence prompted thunderous applause from about
150 officers in the courtroom.
   ``You are unfit to be a member of our society,'' the judge told
Copeland.
   Demakos said he wished the law allowed him to make the sentences
consecutive. He said he would recommend no parole and said that
when he retires, his last act would be to remind the parole board
of his recommendation.
   Copeland, 23, was the first of three young men to be sentenced
in the killing. He was convicted March 29 with Todd Scott, 20, and
Scott Cobb, 25, after a two-month trial in the death of officer
Edward Byrne, who was shot five times while he guarded the home of
a drug witness in February 1988.
   Bush gave the case national publicity during last year's
presidential campaign and called it a symbol of drug-related crime.
Byrne's family gave his badge to Bush, who called the killers a
``gang of cocaine cowards.''
   Byrne's funeral drew 10,000 uniformed police officers from
around the country.
   Prosecutors charged that the defendants killed Byrne on orders
issued from jail by reputed drug kingpin Howard ``Pappy'' Mason,
who reportedly was enraged when he was jailed on a gun possession
charge.
   ``There is no doubt that of the three, Copeland was the worst,''
Demakos said. ``This arrogant act assaults our society.''
   Assistant District Attorney Eugene Kelly called Copeland ``the
mastermind'' of the plot. ``This is a crime of monstrous
proportions. ... This was a message to society.''
   Scott and Cobb face the same sentences for second-degree murder
and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the United States
that he has halted its weapons shipments to Nicaragua's leftist
government, but the White House today said the evidence shows the
opposite and accused him of ``drugstore cowboy'' rhetoric.
   President Bush is waiting for Gorbachev to match his ``words
with deeds,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
who also accused Gorbachev of playing ``a PR game.''
   ``We are very leery their intentions,'' he said, noting that the
Soviets have made no public statements about cutting off aid to
Nicaragua.
   Gorbachev informed President Bush of the decision in a letter
this month and confirmed it in conversations with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III in Moscow last week, an administration
official said Monday night.
   Fitzwater did not directly confirm the letter, but said the
Soviets gave private indications to U.S. officials that they were
ceasing their military aid to Nicaragua, as President Bush has
pushed them to do.
   ``At this point we don't see the evidence of any cutoff. The
military aid is still coming in. It could be that is still in the
pipeline. It could be aid from another country, from Cuba or
something on that order,'' Fitzwater said,
   He said U.S. officials have evidence showing that Nicaragua has
received military shipments amounting to ``several millions'' of
dollars since the beginning of this year, but he could not say from
where it was coming.
   Fitzwater linked the Nicaragua situation with recent Soviet arms
cut proposals, which he said ``appear to be something they're not.''
   ``That's the essence of the PR game that he's playing here,''
when asked why it seemed Gorbachev was making all the initiatives,
while Bush lays back.
   ``And that is that the United States has been very careful and
methodical in it's examiniation of our relationship with the Soviet
Union,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We contrast that, which is an admittedly cautious approach, to
the one of throwing out in a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion one
arms control proposal after another out of which upon examination
appears to be either very little change from existing situation
involving promises that have been made in the past, involving
reductions that are not meaningful in terms of our strategic
relationship with the Soviet Union.''
   Prior to his Moscow visit, Baker had cited Soviet support of the
Sandinistas as a litmus test for U.S.-Soviet relations, questioning
whether Gorbachev's deeds would live up to his words of
conciliation toward the West.
   Bush received Gorbachev's letter before Baker went to Moscow,
where the secretary of state met with Gorbachev and Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The United States estimated that the Soviets provided $515
million in various forms of military aid, including weapons, to the
Sandinista government in Nicaragua last year. The most potent
weapons were attack helicopters.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed
that Gorbachev's assurances did not foreclose delivery of other
forms of military assistance besides weapons. That assistance could
include vehicles, supplies and clothing. Baker did not persuade the
Soviet leaders to cut off that assistance as well, the source said.
   Also, the Soviets declined to suspend their military support of
Cuba, the other prominent Soviet client state in the region, the
official said. The United States had also sought to have the
Soviets halt supplies to Cuba.
   Ernesto Palazio, head of Washington office of the Nicaraguan
rebels, said he was not convinced that Gorbachev's reported
commitment would diminish the Sandinista military capability.
   He said press reports about Gorbachev's position indicate that
Cuba may replace the Soviet Union as the Sandinistas' arms supplier.
   ``Cuba now manufactures similar arms,'' Palazio said. ``So
whether the Soviet Union does it (arms the Sandinistas) directly or
through a surrogate, we'll just have to wait and see.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, hailed the Soviet decision as
overdue.
   ``It's high time that the Soviet Union does stop supplying
military support to Nicaragua,'' Wright said, adding that he had
discussed the matter with Soviet diplomats during the Reagan
administration.
   ``It has to come,'' he said. ``If we're really to demilitarize
the zone we really do need to get foreign interests out of there.''
   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, called it
``a very welcome decision.''
   The Swedish foreign minister, Sten Andersson, here for talks
with Bush and Baker, today called Gorbachev's move a ``very
positive step.''
   Rebels, known as Contras and backed by the United States, have
been fighting the Sandinista forces since 1981. The United States
provided arms to the Contras, but Congress subsequently limited
U.S. assistance to so-called humanitarian aid.
   Baker, while in Moscow, said he had made headway with Gorbachev
and Shevardnadze toward cooperation in Latin America, the Middle
East and other areas, but did not disclose the Gorbachev letter.
   In the Kremlin last week, Shevardnadze reiterated to Baker that
weapons deliveries had ceased and Gorbachev underscored the
commitment at a 3{-hour meeting with Baker, the official said.

   Shooting broke out in the capital
today and tanks circled the presidential palace and other key
government buildings in an apparent dispute among military leaders.
   A civilian employee inside the Ministry of Defense, where
shooting broke out in late afternoon, told The Associated Press by
telephone the trouble stemmed ``from an apparent division'' among
top officers.
   The employee, who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified, said a measure of calm had returned by mid-evening and
the two sides were talking within the ministry in an attempt to
resolve their differences.
   The trouble broke out several hours after President Mengistu
Haile Mariam left Addis Ababa for a previously unannounced visit to
East Germany. Sources said he took his family with him.
   There have been persistent reports of army unrest in Ethiopia,
whose Marxist government is engaged in war against separate rebel
groups in its northernmost provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.
   Government forces have been pushed out of Eritrea and Tigre
provinces in a series of humiliating, recent defeats by the
Eritrean People's Liberation Army and the Tigray People's
Liberation Army.
   Civilian and military employees were not allowed to leave the
Defense Ministry building after the trouble erupted. It was ringed
by tanks, armored cars and troops in what appeared to be defensive
positions.
   ``I don't know what we've got, quite frankly,'' said a spokesman
for the U.S. Embassy. ``We've got reports of some shooting in the
city, but not a great deal of it.''
   ``I cannot comment on what's going on,'' said Allen Collins,
head of chancellery in the British Embassy. ``We are trying to make
our own assessment and any comment would be premature.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa had confirmed that there was
fighting in the streets, but had no other information about the
conflict.
   ``We don't know exactly what is going on there,'' Boucher said.
   Government sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said shooting broke out inside the Defense Ministry at about 4 p.m.
just as employees were about to end their day. It could not be
determined if there were any casualties.
   Almost immediately, two Air Force MIG jet fighters began buzzing
the city repeatedly and tanks, armored personnel carriers and
troops surrounded the ministry.
   Later, tanks, armored cars and soldiers took up positions
outside other key government buildings, including the presidential
palace, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Information,
which houses the government broadcasting station.
   The radio station continued to broadcast normally and there were
no announcements by the government. Internal and international
communications channels also were uninterrupted.
   Later in the evening, however, the city's international airport
was closed to all traffic. Airport controllers, monitored by radio,
gave no reason as they diverted commercial flights to nearby
Djibouti.
   Shortly after the closure, tanks and troops took up positions at
the airport.
   Between four and six Soviet-made helicopter gunships began
circling the city after the jets retired, and police and soldiers
were keeping people away from the city's center, where the Ministry
of Defense is located.

<HEAD>Senate Memo Sheds Light on Process of Acquiring Political Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate office memo inadvertently faxed to a
news organization sheds new light on how Capitol Hill groundwork is
laid for the political favors that can make or break legislation.
   The bill in question here, writes a staffer for Sen. Connie Mack
of Florida, is harmless, might help at home and would be ``a big
big big favor'' to a party colleague seeking higher office in
another state.
   The legislation _ on plastics recycling _ probably isn't a vital
issue to many in Congress, but it is to Rep. Jim Courter, whose New
Jersey district would include a national headquarters for a major
recycling project if the bill passes.
   Passage of the Republican congressman's bill would be something
solid he could point to as he presses his campaign to succeed Gov.
Tom Kean in New Jersey. So while he prepares to introduce the bill
in the House, he's been searching for someone to sponsor it in the
Senate. Someone like Mack, a Florida Republican.
   That's where the memo _ accidentally sent by facsimile machine
to The Associated Press _ comes in.
   It was written by Michele Chouteau, at the time a staff member
for Mack, to the senator's administrative assistant, Mitch Bainwol.
   Ms. Chouteau, who left Mack's office on Friday to take over as
press secretary for Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., said she sent the
memo Monday to her old office and speculated it may have been
mistakenly faxed with other material to AP's New Hampshire office
in Concord.
   The undated document describes a $15 million plastics recycling
bill to provide grants to several universities, including the
University of Florida at Gainesville, the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, and Rutgers University, which is in
Courter's district.
   Why should Mack sponsor it? Ms. Chouteau spelled out four
arguments:
   _ ``It is virtually a harmless issue.
   _ ``It gives money to UF while not being a very expensive piece
of legislation.
   _ ``It's a decent environmental initiative that can be played up
or down as much as you see fit.''
   _ ``It would be a big big big favor to a Republican seeking the
governor's slot in New Jersey. Courter needs a Senate sponsor and
is dealing with New Jersey (Bradley and Lautenberg), Massachusetts
(need we say more?) and Florida (which leaves Graham and CM). Yes,
CM is his only hope for an appropriate Senate sponsor.''
   Ms. Chouteau said Monday that she had meant that ``CM,'' Sen.
Mack, was the only Republican senator from among those states that
could expect grants.
   ``These are my analyses, really,'' Ms. Chouteau said.
``Courter's office said, `Here's the bill, what do you think?' In
trying to expedite (action by) the senator's office, I tried to put
in my arguments.''
   Courter spokesman Phil Peters declined to say whether Courter's
aides had been making the same arguments Ms. Chouteau made. ``As
far as she analyzed the legislation, I don't have any comment on
that,'' he said.
   He did take issue with her dismissing chances of sponsorship
from other states' senators, pointing to Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.,
as a possible candidate.
   Mack spokesman Mark Mills said he saw the memo for the first
time on Monday, but had been aware for about a week of Courter's
attempt to win Mack's sponsorship.
   ``From our standpoint, the reason we were brought in on it is
that it will impact the University of Florida in Gainesville. If it
helps Florida, we're all for it,'' Mills said. ``All the other
arguments I'm just not familiar with.''
   Mills said Mack's staff would be consulting with the university
on the legislation sometime this week.
   Courter's aide, Peters, said he understood Mack had been tied up
with monitoring the election in Panama and might have been unable
to review the legislation in the three weeks since the senator's
office had been given copies.

   Americans are unwise to threaten a troop
withdrawal from Europe because of differences with the West German
government over short-range NATO nuclear missiles, Horst Ehmke, a
leader of the West German Social Democratic Party, said today.
   ``Let's stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolving
the alliance,'' Ehmke, deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary
group, told reporters at a news conference arranged by Foreign
Policy magazine.
   Ehmke, in Washington for talks with members of Congress and the
Bush administration, said a majority of West Germans oppose U.S.
plans to upgrade the Lance missiles.
   The United States and Britain are leading an effort in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to replace the 88 Lance missiles,
which have a range of 71 miles, with more powerful rockets that
would come closer to the short-range limit of 310 miles.
   All the main political parties in West Germany, including
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, have objected to the
``modernization'' effort.
   West German leaders also have called for negotiations with the
Soviet Union to reduce or eliminate the weapons on both sides, but
the U.S. government has objected, claiming the missiles are needed
to deter any attack from the larger Soviet Bloc conventional forces.
   Influential members of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee
have said that they might urge a withdrawal of United States forces
from Europe if the West Germans insist on increasing the risk to
the troops by removing the missiles.
   ``It's not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw your
troops,'' said Ehmke. ``The German people will feel like they were
being blackmailed.''
   He said the United States should back down from its refusal to
negotiate with the Soviet Union on reducing the short-range
missiles in Europe.
   ``I don't see any reason for the American fear'' about
negatiating, Ehmke said. ``The most dangerous position in this
respect is the one the American administration is taking right now
by saying no negotiations.''
   It would be much easier to negotiate while saying that any
reduction in the conventional and nuclear forces would have to be
acceptable to both sides in Europe, he said.
   ``It would be much easier to win popular support for a position
like that than for the position the American government has now,''
Ehmke said.
   He said Americans shouldn't view their commitment to NATO as
purely to help the Europeans.
   ``Your troops are over there not only for the protection of
Germany but for the protection of your own interests,'' he said.
``You could not allow the Soviets to get influence over the
European coast of the Atlantic.''
   ``On the other hand we like you to be there because we are not
big enough to do the job alone,'' Ehmke said. ``So it's in our
interests. We need you to protect our sea and air lanes.''

<HEAD>A 5-Cent Part in a $2 Box</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unnecessary Pentagon specifications have
wasted taxpayers' dollars with at least one defense contractor
forced to package a 5-cent spare part in a $2 box, witnesses told a
Senate panel Tuesday.
   Contractors described for the Senate Governmental Affairs
subcommittee on oversight of government management how strict
Pentagon specifications for commercially available products, along
with excessive requirements, have made them less than willing to
deal with the Defense Department.
   ``My manager said he'd rather have AIDS than a government
contract,'' Robert Rossow III of Midland Brake Inc., of Owosso,
Mich., told the Senate panel.
   While contractors expressed their misgivings to one
subcommittee, another panel was hearing testimony from officials of
the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional watchdog
agency, on a report concluding that the once-large U.S. advantage
in a variety of defense technologies has diminished.
   ``The defense technology base is not in crisis,'' Alan Shaw,
manager of the office's international security and commerce
program, told the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on defense
industry and technology. ``But it does face major problems.''
   Stiff competition from an increasing number of foreign
competitors, delays in translating laboratory research and
development into practical use and a vast number of rules and
regulations that slow the acquisition process were among the
problems cited in the report.
   B. Dan Pinick, senior vice president of the Boeing Co.,
described to the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee one such
encounter with excessive regulations.
   Boeing, in its bid for the Navy's Long-Range Air ASW Capability
Aircraft, proposed a modified version of its 757 commercial
jetliner. At the time of the bid, the commercial jet program was 10
years old, meaning that Boeing's contracts with suppliers and
vendors had been firmly established, Pinick said.
   Based on previous contracts, Boeing proposed to the Pentagon
waiving certain contract clauses and military specifications that
are applied to new, government-designed aircraft. To comply with
the clauses, Boeing would have had to reopen and try to renegotiate
about 3,900 contacts, Pinick said.
   ``We believe there is a large base of high-quality commercial
suppliers to which the U.S. government may not have access because
of the terms and conditions associated with government contracts,''
the Boeing official said.
   Rossow described how one Pentagon overspecification required him
to package a 5-cent, brake system repair part in a plastic bag, a
box wrapped in plastic and then another box, at a cost of $2.
   ``Life has enough complications without deliberately courting
more,'' Rossow said. ``Given the complexities and risks associated
with government contracting, who needs it?''
   The complaints from the government contractors came one day
after a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
found that almost 100,000 companies stopped doing business with the
Pentagon over a five-year period.
   The report, by the private, non-profit think tank that studies
national security issues, found that in 1982, more than 138,000
companies provided goods to the Defense Department. But by 1987,
the number had dropped to less than 40,000.
   ``Some of the 80,000 went out of business, including about
20,000 small businesses,'' the report said. ``Most of the 80,000
firms, however, simply quit doing business with the Defense
Department and opted for other customers.''
   The report found that in comparison to other industries,
``defense is not a highly profitable business.''

   When restaurants around here say they don't
sell food to go, they mean business.
   A parking lot fight at a popular seafood restaurant wound up
with nine people arrested for carrying concealed fish.
   The scuffle broke out Mother's Day after one car hit another in
the parking lot and quickly escalated.
   When police arrived they arrested one man and charted him with
aggravated battery and disturbing the peace. They booked another
man on charges of disturbing the peace and took him to a hospital
for treatment of a stab wound.
   Then the officers searched the cars and booked all nine for
misdemeanor theft because they found linen napkins from the
restaurant containing fried oysters and fish _ a violation of the
restaurant's no-takeout policy.
   ``All of them had the buffet,'' said police Sgt. Bill Burke.
``They were good customers. When they left, they concealed their
food, but there is no takeout.''
   All nine were free on bail Tuesday.

   Tenor Luciano Pavarotti hung his head and
walked off stage during the third act of ``Tosca'' after his voice
cracked.
   The curtain was 45 minutes late going up for Monday night's
performance of the Puccini opera because doctors were treating
Pavarotti backstage for throat problems. The singer decided to go
on but missed a high B-flat.
   Pavarotti mumbled ``Sorry'' and signaled the conductor to start
again, but approached the same note with the same results.
   ``I cannot do it. I am sorry,'' he said. The audience applauded
after the curtain fell and the houselights came up.
   It was Pavarotti's first appearance in Pittsburgh in a fully
staged opera.
   Pittsburgh Opera Director Tito Capobianco said a decision would
be made on whether Pavarotti would repeat the performance, for
which tickets cost up to $90. Four more sold-out performances are
scheduled through next week.

   Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf has armed
and restored a torpedo boat for his private flotilla.
   The king bought the decommissioned 32-year-old vessel in 1987
for $15,000. He was the only bidder when the boat was offered for
scrap, stripped of its guns.
   Since then he has added surface-to-air missile launchers, rocket
launchers and torpedo tubes to the T-46, once the warhorse of the
Swedish navy. It carries no ammunition and its guns cannot be
fired, the newly appointed captain says.
   ``He is very interested in boats and everything connected with
the sea,'' said Commander Ninian Ramel, who was the ship's skipper
23 years ago and was named by the king to take the helm again.
   Carl Gustaf served on a T-46 vessel during his military service.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy today blocked a 15-year-old Florida girl from getting an
abortion without first getting the consent of her parents or a
judge.
   The stay came just three hours after the Florida Supreme Court
said it would allow the girl to get an abortion, clearing the way
for other minors to have abortions without such permission.
   The state's abortion-consent law, which took effect in February,
was ruled unconstitutional by a state appellate court Friday and
the state Supreme Court said today it would rule this fall on the
law's constitutionality.
   Kennedy, acting on a request by a lawyer appointed to represent
the fetus, issued a stay in Washington. His order blocks the
abortion until the full U.S. Supreme Court considers the matter,
probably at a closed conference Thursday.
   The case involves a 15-year-old girl who wants an abortion but
was afraid to seek her parents' consent.
   ``Certainly time is of the essence, and that can be determined
from the flurry of activity,'' Richard Boylston, a lawyer from
Tavares appointed to represent the interest of the fetus, had said
earlier.
   Jerri Blair, attorney for the Lake County 15-year-old, filed a
motion Monday to dissolve the stay.
   The girl is 12 weeks pregnant, and many clinics won't perform
abortions after the 13th week of pregnancy because of a greater
risk of medical complications, she noted.
   Ms. Blair refused to say today if her client had been told of
the decision and also said she would not disclose any decision the
girl makes on whether to go ahead with the abortion.
   ``I think we are examining a law that needs to be examined, that
needs to be very clear for the trial courts,'' Ms. Blair said.
``Ultimately, what will happen, it will cause the Legislature to
revisit and clarify the guidelines.''
   The state high court will set a schedule for lawyers to submit
written arguments on the constitutional issues and argue the case
before the justices in the fall.
   The case began May 2 when the girl petitioned a Lake County
court for permission to get an abortion without her parents'
consent. She said she could not approach her parents for permission
without fearing emotional or physical abuse.
   Two days later, Circuit Judge Jerry T. Lockett denied the girl's
petition, saying the state's abortion-consent law was unworkable
because it is unconstitutionally vague and does not let judges hold
proper hearings.
   Charlene Carres, legislative counsel for the Florida American
Civil Liberties Union, filed a friend-of-the-court brief Monday
claiming that the girl had a constitutional right to privacy, and
hence to an abortion, without outside consent.
   The Florida Attorney General's Office filed a motion supporting
the parental-consent law.
   Of approximately 75,000 abortions performed in Florida last
year, about a third were on minors, according to pro-choice
activists. Yet, since the new law took effect in February, few
teen-agers have gone through the court system to seek a judge's
permission for an abortion.
   Janis Compton-Carr, executive director of the Florida Abortion
Rights Action League, says many are simply bypassing the legal
system and traveling to Georgia.
   Amanda Jones, director of a Gainesville abortion clinic called
the Bread and Roses Well Women Care Center, said Monday that she
has referred 20 to 30 girls to Georgia abortion clinics in recent
months, but fears many of them wouldn't be able to afford the trip.
   ``Some girls can't even get a ride to the center, much less to
Georgia,'' Ms. Jones said.

<HEAD>Quayle Returns To Senate To Praise, Jokes And A Request For Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle made a nostalgic
return Tuesday to the Senate committee room where he helped shape
the nation's largest job training program and was met with heaps of
praise, a handful of jokes and a serious request for more money.
   The topic of the unusual forum hosted by members of the Senate
Labor Committee was the Job Training Partnership Act, which Quayle,
then a senator, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy co-authored in 1982. The
program was cited during the presidential campaign as Quayle's
major congressional achievement.
   Quayle's appearance came less than a week after Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole introduced the Bush administration proposals to
answer criticisms of the program.
   The administration proposed channeling most money to the
unskilled poor and teen-agers and establishing a separate program
title for youth-training programs now scattered throughout JTPA
ventures that also serve adults.
   Current formulas, written by Quayle and Kennedy in the midst of
the 1981-82 recessions, allocated two-thirds of JTPA money to areas
with high unemployment rates regardless of whether those unemployed
lack basic skills.
   Tuesday's forum was designed to promote bipartisanship as
Congress considers major revisions to the program. But with no new
ground to break, the sessions instead largely unfolded as a
love-fest for Quayle
   Kennedy, leading the praise, also took a minute to add that he
expected Quayle to lobby President Bush for additional funding for
the multi-billion-dollar program.
   ``We were genuine partners on JTPA but Dan Quayle was the senior
partner,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass. ``It was a Quayle-Kennedy bill,
not a Kennedy-Quayle bill.''
   Kennedy praised Quayle for sticking with the bill despite
opposition from the Reagan-Bush administration. Quayle himself
recalled having not-so-nice things to say about the occupants of
the White House at that time.
   ``I can remember those days, Orrin, how we referred to those
folks down there at the White House,'' Quayle said to Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, who at the time was committee chairman.
   But he added with a smile: ``I've changed my mind.''
   There were jokes about Quayle's age, too.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he missed having the 42-year-old
vice president as the ranking Republican on a subcommittee he
leads, a position now held by Sen. Strom Thurmond.
   ``He has not had as much experience in the Senate as you have
had,'' Simon said jokingly of the 86-year-old Thurmond, who has
served in the Senate since Quayle was 9 years old.
   Quayle thanked his former colleagues for their praise but said
it was their work that would bring about the needed changes to JTPA.
   After all, he told them, he was at the forum only ``as someone
remarked, somebody who used to have an important job in this town.''

<HEAD>Gallup Survey Says Most South Africans Oppose International Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Gallup survey released Tuesday found most
South Africans oppose international economic sanctions, saying such
measures would lead to more joblessness in their nation.
   Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because
they would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the
government to resign within five years.
   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 of
mixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South African
Chamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.
   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the
whites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would lead
to higher unemployment.
   Release of the survey coincided with a visit set this week by
leaders of South Africa's pro-sanctions movement, including Nobel
Prize-winning Archbishop Desmond Tutu, seeking support from
President Bush and congressional leaders for proposed negotiations
between the black majority and the white South African government
to end racial segregation policies.
   Tom Main, chief executive of the mining association, said the
study was commissioned to provide ``a definitive idea of the pros
and cons in the sanctions debate'' as other countries consider
whether to follow the U.S. example and impose trade restrictions on
South Africa.
   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,
overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to force
the government to grant political rights to the black majority.
   Main, speaking by satellite from Johannesburg, said at a news
conference to present the Gallup survey that South Africa's coal
mining industry had a drop in 1987 exports from 44 million tons to
37 million but bounced back last year to post its second best
exports ever.
   The sanctions resulted in the loss of 8,000 to 10,000 jobs, he
added, all of them held by blacks.
   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4
percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director for
Gallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers
of the same race as the respondent.
   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the
whites, 58 percent of all respondents, said American companies in
South Africa can help make the government moderate its racial
policies.
   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites
said ending American business operations would seriously hurt the
South African economy.

   Oral Roberts said Tuesday a seven-week
``life-or-death'' fund drive raised the $11 million his ministry
needs to pay creditors.
   The 71-year-old evangelist in March said he needed the money by
Oral Roberts University's graduation May 6 or creditors would start
dismantling the school, the ministry and its hospital, the City of
Faith Medical Center.
   Ministry officials met with creditors to seek additional time,
and Roberts announced in a live broadcast Tuesday that the final
$24,000 had been raised.
   Ministry spokeswoman Jan Dargatz said that does not mean the
evangelist's financial worries are over. Monthly contributions must
be kept at about $3.3 million to sustain the ministry, the
university and the hospital, she said.
   The ministry said monthly contributions declined from $5 million
to $2.7 million over the past two years. Roberts blamed ``a spirit
of skepticism'' after scandals in the ministries of Jim Bakker and
Jimmy Swaggart.

<HEAD>Discovery Channel Announces Program for High School Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Discovery Channel jumped into the
burgeoning classroom cable television market Tuesday with
``Assignment: Discovery,'' a daily teaching aid that boasts no
commercials and broad support from educators.
   The hour-long program, due to debut Sept. 18, will be shown five
days a week at 9 a.m., Eastrn time, on cable systems offering The
Discovery Channel.
   Teachers will be allowed to tape the programs and use them as
needed for up to a year after the initial broadcast.
   Corporations and foundations will be recruited as underwriters,
Discovery officials said, but billboards identifying the
underwriters will not interrupt the two major educational segments
planned for each hour.
   ``We're approaching this first and foremost as a public
service,'' said Discovery chairman John Hendricks. He said
satellite time will cost about $250,000 a year but declined to
estimate the price tag on the entire project. ``We don't expect to
incur huge losses,'' he said.
   The four-year-old Discovery Channel, which specializes in
documentaries, is shown on cable systems with 41.3 million
subscribers. Hendricks estimates the channel is already available
in 65 percent of the nation's schools.
   The announcement of ``Assignment: Discovery'' comes on the heels
of Ted Turner's announcement that his Cable News Network will begin
running a 15-minute current events show called ``CNN Newsroom'' on
Aug. 14. Teachers will be able to tape the early-morning program
and use it in their classrooms.
   Turner decided at the last minute to nix the commercials
initially included in the package. He said CNN will absorb millions
of dollars in production costs.
   Turner's entry was widely viewed as competition for a 12-minute
newscast with two minutes of commercials, the controversial
``Channel One'' from Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn. The
program, which comes with $50,000 in TV equipment for participating
schools, was recently tested in six high schools.
   Discovery President Ruth Otte said her network is not in the
news business and does not consider its new program competition for
the CNN or Whittle shows. ``More power to all of us if we can all
make a contribution,'' she said.
   ``Assignment: Discovery'' will feature a particular subject area
each day of the week: Science and techology on Monday; social
science on Tuesday; natural science on Wednesday; arts and
humanities on Thursday, and world events and contemporary issues on
Friday.
   Each hour will consist of two 20-to-25-minute curriculum
segments, an ``educator's bulletin board'' with news and
information for teachers, and sponsorship billboards between the
segments. The curriculum segments will be drawn from the channel's
extensive documentary collection.
   Officials said that the program will be aimed at secondary
school students but that past experience indicates some teachers of
younger children will also use the programs. Schools can buy a
supplemental teaching package for $100 a year and copy it for
distribution to all interested teachers.
   The major obstacle to the series was overcoming copyright
restrictions, Hendricks said. Otte said that educational rights are
being sought for documentaries already in the network's library and
that such rights will be included in future contracts with film
producers.
   The series has been developed in consultation with teachers,
administrators and others in the education community _ a
characteristic that sets it apart from the Whittle and Turner
efforts, educators say.
   ```Assignment: Discovery''' is teacher friendly ... primarily
because the Discovery Channel has taken the time to do its homework
before jumping into the classroom,'' said Lew Armistead, a
spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School
Principals.
   ``This is indeed a partnership,'' said Gary Marx, a spokesman
for the American Association of School Administrators. He said the
Discovery program is designed primarily to enhance education, while
Whittle's basic purpose is ``the commercial exploitation of a
captive audience'' of students.
   The principals' and administrators' groups, along with the
National School Boards Association, have formed an advisory panel
to support the Discovery effort.

   Scientists said Tuesday that they have
been unable to determine what killed seven seals washed ashore
since April 27 and that the deaths simply may reflect an increasing
seal population.
   ``We've seen more seals south of Cape Cod and all the way down
to Chesapeake Bay than we normally do,'' said Doug Beach, a
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Woods Hole,
Mass.
   The dead harbor seals washed ashore in Portsmouth and Tiverton.
   ``The animals must have died pretty suddenly,'' said Bernadette
Bode, spokeswoman for the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium in Mystic,
Conn. ``They weren't suffering from a long-term illness'' and
showed no signs of poisoning or injury.
   ``There were a lot of harbor seals in the area,'' she said. ``It
could be a natural occurrence. It doesn't necessarily point to any
evil against the animals.''
   Harbor seals, which grow to 160 to 200 pounds and 4{ to 5{ feet
long, normally spend winters in Long Island Sound and migrate to
northern New England in the summer.

   The judge preparing for a custody battle
over frozen embryos says he's reminded of the classic Scopes
``monkey trial'' that thrust another small Tennessee court under a
national microscope 64 years ago.
   Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young said the custody case weighs
so heavily on his mind that he reread ``Six Days or Forever,'' Ray
Ginger's account of the 1925 Scopes trial in Dayton, in which the
teaching of evolution was attacked successfully.
   That trial drew national attention as famed attorneys Clarence
Darrow and William Jennings Bryan squared off.
   ``There's not a day goes by that I don't think about the case
and what the issue will be,'' Young said of the custody battle
between Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis. The trial is
scheduled for Aug. 7.
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think hearing any lawsuit in
this court would attract the attention of more than 12 jurors and
the parties,'' he told The Knoxville Journal in an interview
published Monday.
   Young said he mostly hears cases involving domestic matters,
civil suits, minor injury and malpractice. His 65-seat courtroom
probably won't be able to hold the reporters, spectators and
lawyers expected for the Davis case.
   Davis obtained a court order temporarily barring his wife from
having seven in-vitro fertilized eggs implanted for pregnancy. He
said the embryos are joint property and that implanting them would
violate his right to decide whether to become a father.
   His wife has said she considers the embryos her best chance to
become a mother. Her attorney has argued that Davis decided to
become a father when he participated in the test-tube baby program.
   Young, a soft-spoken man with an easy smile, said he won't let
the national attention affect his decision.
   ``We're going to do it in a professional manner,'' he said.

<HEAD>Failure to Report Contract Payments Costing IRS `Billions': GAO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers' failure to withhold taxes from
paychecks of workers who are erroneously carried on the books as
``independent contractors'' is costing the federal treasury
billions of dollars, government auditors said Tuesday.
   In 1984 alone, the General Accounting Office said in testimony
to the House Government Operations consumer subcommittee, the loss
was nearly $1.6 billion. By comparison, the anti-crime plan
announced Monday by President Bush would cost $1.2 billion.
   The GAO, an arm of Congress, said government agencies _ federal,
state and local _ have been just as lax as businesses in filing
required reports on payments made to independent contractors.
   ``The importance of employers filing required information
returns on payments made to independent contractors cannot be
overemphasized,'' said Paul L. Posner, a GAO associate director.
``Billions of dollars of taxes are owed due to independent
contractors' unreported income and misclassification. With this
compliance problem, enhanced IRS enforcement efforts are
warranted.''
   An independent contractor provides services ranging from lawn
mowing to computer programming. Whether a worker is a contractor or
an employee depends on a 20-part IRS test of who sets working hours
and conditions.
   If a worker is classified as an employee, the employer must
withhold Social Security and income taxes, match the Social
Security tax and pay an unemployment tax. But if the worker is
classified as an independent contractor, the employer withholds no
tax and pays neither a Social Security nor unemployment tax. Too, a
contractor may claim business deductions that are not available to
an employee.
   Under the law, an employer must report to the IRS on payments of
over $600 a year for services provided by a non-corporate
independent contractor. That permits the IRS to cross-check those
reports against the contractor's tax return.
   The IRS found that about 14 percent of businesses sampled had
misclassified some employees as independent contractors in 1984.
   ``IRS needs to do more to see that employers understand and act
on their reporting responsibilities,'' the GAO told the House
panel. Too, the report said, the IRS needs to be more aggressive in
searching out cases of failure to report when business tax returns
are audited.
   The acting IRS commissioner, Michael J. Murphy, acknowledged
that the agency could do more and said that efforts to improve IRS
performance in this area are already are under way. He blamed
Congress for part of the problem.
   In 1978, the IRS operated a tough enforcement program that
resulted in back taxes and stiff penalties being levied against
many businesses. In response, Congress passed a law preventing the
IRS from reclassifying as an employee any worker that a business
had reasonable ground for listing as an independent contractor.
   That law works to the disadvantage of employers who properly
classify workers and is difficult to administer, Murphy said. He
urged Congress to consider changing it.
   The GAO estimated the law cost the federal treasury at least
$111 million in 1984.
   The GAO report cited a Treasury Department finding that 12 of 14
federal agencies surveyed had failed to report $9 billion in
payments to independent contractors in 1984 and 1985. The GAO
conducted its own spot survey of state and local governments and
found 16 of 17 state agencies checked and seven of 10 local units
were not in full compliance.
   ``In reviewing $9 million in payments to independent contractors
(by the sampled state and local agencies) that were subject to
information reporting, we found that $8 million had not been
reported,'' Posner said.
   Many state and local officials do not fully understand the
reporting requirements and IRS has not done enough to clear up the
confusion, the GAO said.
   The GAO spot-checked business tax returns that had been audited
by the IRS and found that in half the cases at least one
information report was missing. The problem was compounded, the
report said, because IRS auditors failed to detect the missing
reports, which involved payments of $6 million to contractors.

<HEAD>World Population Could Hit 14 Billion in 2100</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Unless women win more access to family planning,
education and employment, the world's population could almost
triple to 14 billion by the year 2100, a U.N. agency said in a
report Tuesday.
   Too many women remain trapped because of fundamentalist
religions that ``keep women in bondage'' and cultural values that
put men first, said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the
United Nations Population Fund, in launching the 1989 State of
World Population Report.
   Appealing for a fivefold increase in world spending on family
planning, the report said: ``The status of women will be crucial in
determining future population growth rates.''
   Half the world's women have no access to family planning
services _ mostly those in traditional male-dominated societies or
areas far from family planning services, Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``Yet, this is precisely the audience we must reach if we are to
have further success in our efforts,'' she said.
   She said world population, now 5.2 billion, ``is at a critical
juncture,'' likely to increase by more than 90 million a year until
the end of the century and stabilize at 10 billion about a century
from now.
   This optimistic projection assumes that fertility in the
developing world will drop by one-third in the next 40 years, the
report said.
   The report said about 465 million women in the developing world,
or 45 percent, use contraceptives: 14 percent in Africa, 50 percent
in Asia, and 56 percent in Latin America.
   Without China's extensive birth control program, the overall use
of contraceptives in the developing world would drop to about 30
percent, the report said.
   To attain the desired drop in fertility, 58 percent of women
will have to be using family planning in 2000 and 71 percent _ the
present level in industrialized countries _ by 2025, it said. In
sub-Saharan Africa, those using family planning would have to
increase tenfold.
   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women are
given more health care, family planning services, education, and
employment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``We now have clear-cut, concrete evidence of linkage between
female education, fertility and mortality, between gainful
employment for women and patterns of family formation, and between
women's participation and the success of population programs and
economic development,'' she said.
   Thirty-one countries in the developing world still have
virtually no family planning facilities, the report said, and 37 of
the poorest countries have cut health spending by half and
education by one-fourth in the last four years.
   If the family planners failed, the world would have 14 billion
people by 2100, which ``would create enormous potential for
violence and social upheaval,'' she said.
   The Pakistani physician called on societies to end legal and
social discrimination against women, increase their access to
leadership positions, and teach at all levels ``that women and men
are equal in value.''
   Asked whether religious fundamentalism was hampering women and
family planning, she replied: ``All these movements seem to be
designed to somehow keep women in bondage.''
   She accused religious leaders of being on ``a power-ego thing
... They're reinforcing their authority. It's like all religious
leaders ... who do they talk to? They talk to the poor and the
illiterate and those are the only groups they can really sway.
   ``All religious movements look at the woman as the one who
should cater to and serve the family, never the other gender,'' she
said.
   She criticized the United States for halting its contribution to
the Fund in 1986. The Reagan administration contended the agency's
policies promoted coercive abortion but Mrs. Sadik said the reasons
were political and expressed hope the Bush administration would
resume the U.S. contribution.
   The U.N. Population Fund urged governments to earmark 1 percent
of gross national product for family planning. It asked major
donors to increase assistance for family planning programs fivefold
to $2.5 billion a year.
   ``This could also save 3 million women's lives by the year 2000,
as fewer poor women would die from complications from pregnancy,
childbirth and illegal abortion,'' Mrs. Sadik said.

   Opponents of a bill to ban ``junk fax'' _
unsolicited facsimile messages _ have jammed the governor's fax
machine with protests.
   Now he's more likely to look kindly on the legislation, says an
aide.
   ``If we had any important messages coming in we wouldn't have
been able to get them through,'' said David S. Iannucci, the
governor's lobbyist.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer's office received 343 fax messages
after a California group, the National Fax Users Committee of
Mission Viejo, faxed hundreds of one-page protest fliers to
Maryland businesses.
   Businesses were urged to sign a protest message on the flyer,
tear the message off and fax it to the Statehouse. About one fifth
of the businesses receiving the message sent it on to the governor,
Ianucci said.
   Iannucci called Thursday's one-day campaign ``incredibly
counterproductive,'' saying it might help persuade Schaefer to sign
the bill.
   One executive sent his flier with an added message, asking
Schaefer to sign the bill into law and stop people ``from using my
fax machine as their printing press.''

<HEAD>Senate Committee Passes Bill for Blind Air Passengers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee approved legislation on
Tuesday that would bar airlines from refusing to seat blind
passengers in rows that have emergency exits.
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, goes against a proposed
Federal Aviation Administration regulation that would prohibit
blind and other disabled people from sitting next to emergency
doors.
   The ease with which the measure was approved by the Commerce
Committee _ debate lasted only several minutes _ might not be
indicative of its prospects for final enactment. Although only two
members of the committee spoke against the bill, congressional
sources said some public supporters have private doubts.
   The bill has been lobbied heavily on both sides, and at least
one member of the committee who supports the measure admits that
the issue has put him in an uncomfortable position.
   ``How would you like to be the guy who voted for this bill on
the one-in-a-billion chance that a blind person was sitting next to
an exit door when an incident occurred, and something happens?''
said the senator, speaking on condition he not be further
identified.
   One congressional source, also speaking only on condition of
anonymity, acknowledged the measure's 31 co-sponsors and the ease
with which it cleared the commerce panel, but said, ``A lot of
people did it anticipating it wasn't going to go anywhere.''
   Groups representing the blind have complained that some
airlines' policies of refusing to seat blind people near emergency
exits are discriminatory. Some advocates for the blind have been
removed from planes and arrested after refusing to leave exit seats
to which they had been assigned.
   The bill's sponsor, committee chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
said the legislation would ``move to eliminate once and for all the
embarrassment and hassle given our blind passengers.''
   But lined up on the other side are the FAA, the airline industry
and many of its labor unions, who argue that if an emergency
occurred, the danger could be greater if the seat nearest the exit
were occupied by a blind traveler.
   In a letter to Hollings written last week, the Air Transport
Association _ which represents the nation's major airlines _ asked
for a study of the problem in place of the legislation.
   ``Until such time as there is good evidence that persons with
visual impairments will not impede an emergency evacuation, we
continue to believe that the prudent course of action is to put the
safety of all passengers and crew members ahead of the narrow
interests of a vocal advocacy group,'' the association wrote.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the House, but it has yet
to receive committee approval.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Politician Retiring After 36 Years In Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helen Suzman, South Africa's
best-known white civil rights campaigner, said Tuesday she will
retire in September after 36 years at the forefront of
anti-apartheid opposition in Parliament.
   ``She will be missed as a courageous fighter who was ahead of
her time,'' said Con Botha, chief spokesman for the governing
National Party.
   Mrs. Suzman, 71, is the longest-serving member of Parliament,
having represented the same Johannesburg constituency since 1953.
   From 1961 until 1974, she was the only legislator representing
opponents of South Africa's legal policy of race discrimination.
Often, she cast the sole vote against discriminatory or repressive
laws.
   She said she would not seek re-election Sept. 6, when a general
election will be held for the white, Asian and mixed-race chambers
of Parliament. She has campaigned consistently to extend political
rights to the black majority, which has no representation in
Parliament.
   Allies and opponents joined in praising her.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the extreme-right Conservative
Party, said: ``I didn't agree with her political views, but she was
someone you could respect for the conviction with which she held
them.''
   One of her liberal colleagues, Colin Eglin, said her years in
politics ``were perhaps unequalled for sustained excellence by an
opposition politician in any parliament in the world.''
   ``Her departure will leave a huge vacuum,'' said The Argus, a
Cape Town newspaper.
   Mrs. Suzman told reporters it was time to let a younger
politician represent her district. She also said she would attempt
to write her memoirs.
   ``My most important task, the disappearance of apartheid, has
not been completed,'' she said. ``But a number of important laws
have been repealed, laws which I opposed when they were introduced,
and that's a source of considerable satisfaction for me.''
   Probably more so than any other white elected official, Mrs.
Suzman earned the trust and good will of black activists. She
attended funerals of slain militants, frequently visited black
townships and in 1987 finished ninth in a poll asking black
newspaper readers who they wanted as president.
   She met several times with imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela, who placed first in that newspaper poll, and she
repeatedly called for his release. Mandela's wife, Winnie, once
referred to Mrs. Suzman as ``the conscience of white South Africa.''

   The government will bow to
Washington's demands and spend more to maintain U.S. troops in
South Korea, it was reported Tuesday.
   In a plan submitted to the National Assembly, the government
said the country will gradually pay more. But Washington should
consider Seoul's already heavy defense burden, which is equivalent
to 6 percent of the gross national product, according to the Yonhap
News Agency.
   Washington, citing the strong economy, has requested that Seoul
contribute more to the cost of maintaining U.S. troops in South
Korea.
   The United States keeps about 43,000 troops in South Korea under
a mutual defense pact to protect it from a possible invasion from
communist North Korea.
   Last year, Seoul spent $2.2 billion maintaining U.S. troops in
South Korea, including $105 million in direct financial aid and the
rest in indirect support such as providing facilities, Yonhap said.

   Housing prices skyrocketed in California in
the first three months of 1989 despite rising mortgage interest
rates, but markets cooled in the Northeast, a real estate trade
group said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, home prices in many Midwestern industrial cities
posted healthy appreciation rates and real estate in oil-producing
states showed a spotty recovery, the National Association of
Realtors said.
   The median price of an existing home in the San Francisco area
soared to $243,900 in the first quarter, meaning half sold for more
and half sold for less. That represented a 31.8 percent increase
from a year ago and was the steepest appreciation rate among 83
metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group.
   In fact, California accounted for the top five appreciation
rates in the nation. Home prices in Orange County shot up 30.2
percent to a median of $237,900. In Los Angeles, prices rose 26.3
percent to $201,000; in San Diego, 21.9 percent to $163,900; and in
Riverside-San Bernardino, 21.6 percent to $116,000.
   That compares with the 3.4 percent increase to $91,600 for the
median-priced existing home for the entire United States.
   A healthy diversified economy, population growth and foreign
investment, particularly from the Japanese, are fueling the boom in
California, according to economist Mark Zandi of the WEFA Group, a
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.
   He and other analysts said, however, that the West Coast market
may be in danger of overheating.
   ``I would be concerned .... that at this point it's
speculatively driven and that the bubble may be about to burst,''
Zandi said. ``Californians seem to have no concern for the amount
of debt they're taking on. They seem to think home prices can
continue escalating forever.''
   ``My guess is you're getting close to the end of this very rapid
price appreciation in California,'' said economist Mark Obrinsky of
the Federal National Mortgage Association. ``I think in this case
the reason is going to be mortgage rates as much as anything else.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages started out the quarter averaging 10.77
percent and jumped nearly half a percentage point to 11.19 percent
by the end of the period. One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages went
from 8.49 percent to 9.31 percent. In the first quarter a year ago,
mortgage rates were falling.
   Northeastern cities continued to be some of the most expensive
places to live, but home prices in New York City and its suburbs;
Boston and Worcester, Mass.; and Hartford and New Haven, Conn.,
either fell or rose only modestly.
   New York area prices _ the fifth highest in the nation, after
San Francisco, Orange County, Honolulu and Los Angeles _ sunk 2.8
percent to $181,700.
   The five least expensive areas in the country were: Peoria,
Ill., $42,000; Spokane, Wash., $50,200; Mobile, Ala., $50,900;
Oklahoma City, $52,300; and Akron, Ohio, $56,000.
   In Texas, the median price of houses and condominiums in Houston
recovered 4.5 percent to $62,900, while the median rose 2.7 percent
to $88,400 in Dallas.
   ``I would certainly treat the Dallas information as a very
positive sign that the Southwest is on the mend,'' said economist
James Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   But home values in smaller Texas cities and elsewhere in
oil-dependent states continued to drop.
   The five biggest declines were in Fort Worth, Texas, 10.9
percent; Oklahoma City, 7.4 percent; Baton Rouge, La., 7 percent;
Worcester, Mass., 5.9 percent; and Tulsa, Okla., 4.7 percent.
   A number of Midwestern cities, bolstered by a resurgence in
manufacturing caused by last year's boom in export sales, posted
strong appreciation rates, including Chicago, up 7 percent,
Columbus, Ohio, up 11.6 percent, Indianapolis, up 10 percent, and
St. Louis, up 9.9 percent.
   The Realtors said the pace of existing home sales lagged
nationally and in most states, although several states with
low-cost housing areas managed to buck the trend.
   Nationally, sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.82 million units, down 6.6 percent from the last quarter of
1988. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia posted
declines, while 22 states recorded increases.
   West Virginia showed the greatest sales pickup, 61.3 percent,
followed by South Dakota, 43.5 percent; North Dakota, 27.1 percent;
Washington, 22.3 percent; and Vermont, 21.6 percent.
   The states with the biggest sales declines were Alaska, 40.6
percent; Utah, 27.7 percent; Louisiana, 23.8 percent; Iowa, 20.2
percent; and Minnesota, 17.7 percent.

<HEAD>West Germans View Troop Pullout Threat As Blackmail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. threats to pull troops from Western
Europe over the NATO short-range nuclear missile dispute are viewed
as ``blackmail'' in West Germany and only aggravate tensions within
the alliance, a leading West German Social Democrat said Tuesday.
   ``It's not wise to hint and say you will withdraw your troops,''
said Horst Ehmke, the chairman of the opposition party's
parliamentary group. ``It's a litte bit short-sighted.''
   Ehmke, a one-time aide to former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt, spoke on the hottest issue dividing members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization at a news conference arranged by
Foreign Policy magazine.
   The United States and Britain want to modernize the alliance's
short-range Lance missile force, but most West Germans and several
other West European nations oppose it.
   Under the proposal, 88 missile launchers would be made more
powerful to carry their 700 or so single-warhead missiles more than
250 miles. The weapons _ designed for use on the battlefield _ now
have a range of only 75 miles. Most are on West German territory.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has irritated U.S. officials
with his objections to the modernization plan and demands for
direct U.S.-Soviet negotiations over the issue. In a rare
combination, all of the West German political parties, including
Kohl's Christian Democrats and Ehmke's Social Democrats, object to
the NATO modernization plan.
   U.S. officials insist the upgraded weapons are necessary to
deter any attack from the larger Soviet Bloc conventional forces.
And they reject the idea of direct negotiations at this point
because of the huge Warsaw Pact advantage.
   In recent weeks, influential members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee have said they might propose a withdrawal of
U.S. forces from Western Europe if the West Germans persist in
their demands. Failing to update the missiles, those senators say,
would increase risks to American soldiers in Europe.
   Arguing that such an approach was ``dead wrong,'' Ehmke also
said he believed that the dispute among the allies had ``gotten out
of hand.''
   ``Let's stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolving
the alliance,'' he said.
   ``It's not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw your
troops. The German people will feel like (that's) blackmail,'' he
added.
   Ehmke, who is in Washington for talks with members of Congress
and State Department officials, said the United States should
rethink its refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union.
   ``I don't see any reason for the American fear'' about
negotiating, Ehmke said. ``The most dangerous position in this
respect is the one the American administration is taking right now
by saying no negotiations.''
   The official said that the heated tone of the NATO argument
should change because it serves only to advance the image of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the proponent of disarmament in
European public opinion.
   ``This puts NATO on the defensive _ the most important thing is
to get the initiative back,'' Ehmke argued, as a reason for the
U.S. side to enter negotiations.

   To thunderous applause from 150 police officers,
a judge Tuesday sentenced a drug dealer to 25 years to life in
prison _ the maximum _ for murdering a rookie policeman guarding
the home of a drug witness.
   ``This arrogant act assaults our society,'' Supreme Court
Justice Thomas A. Demakos told Philip Copeland, 23, who was
convicted along with two other men March 29 in the February 1988
slaying of Officer Edward Byrne.
   ``There is no doubt that, of the three, Copeland was the
worst,'' said Demakos, charging that Copeland arranged the murder
after getting an to ``ice a cop'' in a jailhouse telephone call
from alleged drug kingpin Howard ``Pappy'' Mason.
   Byrne was shot five times at close range as he sat alone in a
parked patrol car on a crack-infested street early on the morning.
He was guarding a house that had been firebombed after its owner
complained about drug dealers outside.
   The case was given national attention by President Bush, who
during the campaign for the White House called it a symbol of
drug-related crime.
   Demakos told Copeland he is ``unfit to be a member of our
society.'' The judge said that he would recommend no parole and
that when he retires, his last act would be to remind the parole
board of his recommendation.
   When Copeland's lawyer, Frank Hancock, told the judge Copeland
feared for his safety in prison, there was more applause from the
officers who packed the courtroom.
   Byrne's mother, Ann, wept as she heard the sentence. Her
husband, Matthew, a former police lieutenant, was stoic.
   The judge postponed until June 6 the sentencing of Copeland's
co-defendants.
   All three earlier rejected a request to name Mason as the
mastermind of the murder in exchange for leniency.
   ``This is a crime of monstrous proportions,'' said Assistant
District Attorney Eugene Kelly. ``This was a message to society.''
   Prosecutors alleged that Mason placed a ``hit'' order by
telephone to Copeland, who recruited the others and promised them
$8,000. Cobb, in a videotaped confession, said of the murder: ``We
lose one, they lose one.''
   Prosecutors said Cobb was the getaway car driver. David McClary,
21, identified by two defendants as the triggerman, goes on trial
Wednesday.
   Byrne's funeral drew 10,000 uniformed police officers from
around the country. The slain officer's father presented then-GOP
nominee Bush with his son's police shield during the presidential
campaign.
   Mason has denied involvement in the murder. He is in prison on a
weapons charge and face charges of drug-racketeering and killing a
parole officer.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted
a Virginia man on charges that he tried to extort $2 million from
the Coca-Cola Co. and two of its top officials by threatening to
poison their products.
   The 14-count indictment charged Lester L. Hummer, about 47, with
extortion, interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise,
attempting to tamper with consumer products and mailing threatening
communications.
   Hummer, of Berryville, Va., allegedly sent several extortion
letters to Coca-Cola President and Chief Operating Officer Donald
R. Keough and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roberto C.
Goizueta between Feb. 22 and April 16, when he was arrested.
   Hummer was arrested at a drop site near Washington-Dulles
International Airport where he was to be paid. He has been held
without bond since his arrest. Arraignment is scheduled Monday
before U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said there was no evidence that
Hummer or anyone else actually tampered with any products.
   ``Due to the cooperation of the Coca-Cola Co. and the
extraordinary investigative skills of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, I am convinced that we have arrested the only
individual who was involved in these extortion attempts and have
done so prior to his carrying out any of the threats he has made in
this matter,'' Hudson said in a statement.
   Hummer faces a maximum prison term of 145 years and a fine of
$3.5 million if convicted on all counts.
   Coca-Cola spokesman Randy Donaldson declined to comment on the
case, other than to say the company had cooperated fully with
authorities.

<HEAD>Indians Complain Water Diversion Cuts Down on Fish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians in Wyoming are
guaranteed fishing rights by federal treaties, but the government
diverts water from the reservation for local farm use so there are
few fish to be had, witnesses told a Senate panel Tuesday.
   An act of Congress more than 40 years ago allowed construction
of the Bull Lake Dam and Reservoir so land in the arid Wind River
Valley could be commercially farmed.
   But in doing so, the government created a seemingly
irreconcilable conflict between the treaty rights of the Indians
and the needs of area residents to water their crops, witnesses
said.
   Water levels sometimes dropped so low fish could not spawn, and
without the fish the Indians were deprived not only of food but
their ability to practice some parts of their religion, the
committee was told.
   Starr Weed, religious leader for the Shoshones, said his tribe
considers the Bull Lake sacred and remembers when buffalo used to
live in the area.
   Since the dam was built the fish aren't always available for an
important tribal ceremony known as the Sun Dance in which fish are
eaten before three days of fasting and dancing, he said.
   ``When the water goes down it hurts our feelings,'' the elderly
Indian told the committee.
   The situation is typical of other parts of the country where
water is in short supply and Indians have a right to it, said Ken
Ballen, chief counsel to the special panel of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs which is investigating all agencies
that have responsibilities to American Indians.
   David Allison, superintendent of the Wind River Agency of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, said he doesn't think the federal
government is meeting its trust responsibilities to the Shoshones
and Arapahoes. And he said he found it frustrating to be an
official with that responsibility.
   ``The federal agencies at Wind River are not properly
coordinating their activities,'' he said.
   The Bureau of Reclamation is charged with making sure the land
is irrigated, while the BIA must protect Indian rights.
   There is ``inherent conflict,'' said Roger Patterson, regional
director of the reclamation bureau.
   ``There's not enough water to satisfy all the purposes,'' he
said.
   Patterson said farmers in the area grow grain and sugar beets
with a production value of about $30 million a year on about 70,000
acres of irrigated land.
   Allison, of the BIA, said the 8,000 or so Indians in the area
are not only losing fish for their own use, but about $500,000 in
trade from the sportsmen who used to fish there.

   Legislation to curb negative political
advertising and independent campaign expenditures was proposed
Tuesday by Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
   ``Increasingly the sentiment of the American people when they
look at American politics today is nausea,'' said Danforth, adding:
``Campaigns should be to inform the public not to nauseate the
public, not to make them feel like throwing up.''
   The bill would require broadcasters to provide free time to
presidential and congressional candidates to respond when:
   _Opponents broadcast ads that refer to them. This would not
apply if an opponent appears in the ad to personally make the
attack.
   _An independent committee or individual broadcasts any type of
political ad either supporting or opposing a candidate. The
senators said this is mainly directed at ads paid for by political
action committees, or PACs.

   The Defense Department notified Congress on
Tuesday it had approved four arms transactions with NATO allies,
including sales of F-16 jet fighters to Portugal and the
Netherlands.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said Portugal would be offered 20 F-16s and support equipment for
about $300 million. The Netherlands plans to purchase 10 F-16s,
less engines, for $116 million, the Pentagon added.
   The other two transactions involve the sale of five SH-2F LAMPS
submarine-hunting helicopters to Portugal for $99 million, and the
sale of 1,400 Seasparrow anti-aircraft missiles to a consortium of
seven NATO allies for $360 million.
   The consortium includes Belgium, Canada, Denmark, West Germany,
the Netherlands, Greece and Norway.
   The Navy will oversee the sale of the Seasparrows and the
helicopters, and the Air Force will oversee the sale of the F-16's,
the Pentagon statement said.

<TEXT>
   Industry witnesses urged Congress Tuesday to
create a trust fund, increase tax credits and take other steps to
encourage research and development work on high-definition
television.
   ``Japanese and European governments have been investing in HDTV
technologies for years,'' Jerry K. Pearlman, chairman and president
of Zenith Electronics Corp., told a Senate subcommittee.
   ``Now is the time for ours to do the same,'' he said. Pearlman
told the subcommittee on science, technology and space.
   Pearlman, whose company is the sole domestic television
manufacturer, proposed setting up a trust fund, financed by a $5
per television excise tax, to pay for the federal portion of HDTV
research by U.S. companies.
   With television sales in the United States running about 20
million a year, such a trust fund could raise $100 million per year.
   Pearlman suggested that after three to four years the excise tax
on conventional televisions could be dropped and the program
financed through sales of high-definition sets.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., introduced a bill that
would require the secretary of commerce to draft within 90 days a
plan of policies and procedures that would underlie development of
high-definition television production.
   Gore, who heads the Commerce subcommittee on technology, said
such production will ``consume more semi-conductors than the entire
U.S. personal computer industry.''
   High-definition TV promises far sharper pictures and clearer
sound than possible from conventional sets.

<TEXT>
   The NATO dispute over deployment of
short-range missiles has widened a split within the government, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Transport Minister Friedrich Zimmermann was quoted by the Bild
am Sonntag newspaper as accusing Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher of covering up his true disarmament aims.
   ``If you look Genscher in the eyes, you know that he is lying,''
the newspaper quoted Zimmermann of the Conservative Socialist Union
as saying during a May 8 meeting of his party leadership.
   Zimmermann on Tuesday denied the report, but Bild am Sonntag
editor Michael Spreng immediately issued a statement saying the
newspaper stood by its article and that it was based on first-hand
reports.
   West Germany's wavering on the issue has triggered a crisis
within the Bonn leadership as well as within NATO. Kohl's coalition
government is composed of three divergent parties _ his own
Christian Democratic Union, the conservative Christian Socialist
Union of Bavaria and the liberal Free Democratic Party.
   Genscher has been at the forefront of West German resistance to
NATO's plan to upgrade short-range missiles deployed in West
Germany, urging the superpowers to try to negotiate down their
weapons stockpiles.
   He has denied he wants the complete elimination of short-range
rockets. But he is a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party
and a vocal supporter of improving relations with Eastern Europe,
and some Bonn officials charge Genscher is aiming for a
nuclear-free Europe.
   A May 29-30 NATO summit will examine the question of replacing
the Lance rockets, which have a range of about 75 miles, with
missiles of a range nearing 300 miles. The United States and
Britain want the rockets upgraded.
   Bonn has insisted that the decision be put off for at least two
years, partly to avoid angering voters before the next federal
elections in December 1990.
   Opinion polls show West Germans are against renewing the
missiles and Kohl's party has suffered serious defeats in recent
local elections, as well as a nationwide tumble in public opinion
polls.

<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices are likely to rise four cents
more a gallon by summer, and the supply outlook is unclear, a
government agency said Tuesday.
   The Energy Information Administration said in a special report
on the summer gasoline outlook that prices for all grades are
likely to average $1.09 a gallon, up from $1.05 now. The average
price last summer was 99 cents a gallon, the report said.
   Prices rose sharply immediately after the March 24 Exxon oil
tanker spill in Alaska, which caused a brief drop in shipments of
North Slope crude oil, but then stabilized.
   The additional price increases by summer will reflect a recent
rise in crude oil prices paid by refiners and an estimated 1 cent
per gallon increase in state gasoline taxes, the report said.
   Also putting upward pressure on prices should be the usual
summertime jump in gasoline demand, reaching a level 1.9 percent
higher than last summer, the agency said. The growth will result in
part from slower gains in auto fuel efficiency.
   The report said that while gasoline supplies currently are
adequate, a squeeze could develop this summer if increased import
requirements cannot be met. It said one-half of the anticipated
increase in gasoline demand would have to be met by imports.

<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin rejected
the resignation of his eight-man Cabinet on Tuesday and sought a
meeting with President-elect Carlos Menem on an orderly transition
of government.
   Menem, a flamboyant provincial governor who led an opposition
Peronist resurgence in elections on Sunday, flew to Buenos Aires
from his northwestern province of La Rioja to meet with aides.
   Menem told a newspaper he was willing to meet ``as many times as
necessary'' with Alfonsin. ``All he has to do is call me,'' Menem
said.
   Alfonsin met for 2{ hours with his Cabinet, rejecting the
resignations that Labor Minister Ideler Tonelli said were offered
``because we thought it was opportune.''
   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez told reporters that
Alfonsin had ordered Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia to contact
Menem ``immediately'' to arrange a meeting.
   The president, Lopez said, plans to ask Menem to appoint liaison
teams that would maintain close contact with each ministry ``in an
effort to make the transition viable until Dec. 10,'' the last day
of Alfonsin's six-year term.
   Alfonsin's decision seemed to reject a call to advance the
inauguration to reduce tension during the nearly seven months
remaining in his term.
   Argentina's economy is staggering under triple-digit inflation,
soaring interest rates, local currency devaluation, a budget
deficit and a $59 billion foreign debt on which no interest
payments have been made since last year.
   Leaders of the Peronist Party and Alfonsin's governing Radical
Civic Union have pledged to work together to ensure a smooth
changeover, but have acknowledged that it will not be easy.
   Alfonsin has tried to balance the budget by selling off state
businesses. Menem's preference is to make the companies more
efficient but keep them in state hands.
   The Peronists have demanded increases in both the minimum wage
and federal aid to the provinces. Alfonsin has tried to hold the
line on each.
   Menem defeated Eduardo Angeloz of the governing party by 7.8
million to 6.1 million votes, or 47.3 percent to 36.9 percent.
   The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Radical Leopoldo
Moreau, suggested Alfonsin consider ``moving up the delivery of
power.''
   ``Menem obtained a resounding, majority support of society,''
Moreau said. ``And if society believes that his proposals,
illusions and hopes are within reach, then let's put them to work
as soon as possible and let's look together for solutions to
existing problems.''
   The Peronist Party also won 67 seats in the Chamber of Deputies
to give it 127, or exactly one half; and one Senate seat to give it
23, also exactly a half. The party controls 17 of 22 provincial
governorships.
   Menem, in an interview published Tuesday by the leftist
newspaper Pagina 12, said he opposed any change in the inauguration
date. It will be Argentina's first transfer of power between freely
elected governments in 61 years.
   ``The constitution is clear, and President Alfonsin must
complete his six years of office,'' Menem was quoted as saying.
   Alfonsin has been widely praised for helping democracy return to
Argentina after the brutal 1976-83 military dictatorship.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain continues to delay spring planting in
parts of the country while other areas, notably the central and
southern Great Plains, still need moisture, an Agriculture
Department report said Tuesday.
   ``Planting is delayed by wet, cool weather in eastern Corn Belt,
Delta and East Coast (areas), but is progressing rapidly in western
Great Lakes, western Corn Belt and spring wheat areas,'' the report
said.
   ``Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan have
planted 30 percent to 43 percent of their corn crop. North Dakota,
Montana and Minnesota have planted about one-third of their spring
wheat,'' it added.
   The report was issued after a meeting of the department's 1989
drought task force, which is headed by Undersecretary Richard
Crowder.
   ``Winter wheat conditions improved in the Pacific Northwest and
northern Great Plains but deteriorated in the central and southern
Great Plains,'' the report said. ``The crop moisture index
indicates excellent moisture for germination of recently planted
crops in the Great Plains, Great Lakes and central Corn Belt.''
   The task force noted that the National Weather Service calls for
beneficial rains in the Great Plains and central Corn Belt in the
next five to 10 days, with favorably drier weather in the eastern
Corn Belt.
   ``The outlook through mid-June calls for cool, wet weather in
the South and East, and warm, dry weather from the eastern Dakotas
into the central Corn Belt,'' the report said.
   Looking at the livestock situation, the report said pasture
conditions nationally are rated ``poor to fair'' but that the
situation in much of the northern plains is ``very poor to severe.''
   ``Cattle slaughter is down 4 percent from a year ago, but last
week's slaughter figures were the same as at this time last year,''
the report said. ``Beef cow slaughter was up around 60 percent (in)
both the central and northern plains, however. Cow prices in recent
weeks have returned to 1987 levels, reflecting the effects of
increased slaughter.''
   The task force said that as of May 15, haying and grazing of
land normally idled during the growing season under acreage
conservation provisions were open for haying and grazing in 323
counties in eight states _ California, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.
   Emergency feed assistance, along with haying and grazing of
other designated conservation land, also has been made available in
designated counties of the drought areas. In all, some form of
special drought aid is available in hundreds of counties in more
than two dozen states.

   The Ohio Highway Patrol superintendent used
bad judgment in accepting two free trips to South Africa and
deserved to be fired, Gov. Richard Celeste said Tuesday.
   Col. Jack Walsh was dismissed Monday after he refused to accept
a demotion to major.
   ``Here's a man who's leader of an elite law enforcement
organization in our state,'' said Celeste, interviewed after a
meeting with President Bush. ``He's going to be recruiting young
blacks to come into the Ohio Highway Patrol, right?''
   Walsh's first trip to racially segregated South Africa, in 1984,
was sponsored by the Johannesburg Safety Council. The second, this
month, was sponsored by the Johannesburg City Council.
   ``I think it was appropriate to say, `We can't have you in this
position of leadership,''' the governor said.
   Celeste said the situation might have been different if Walsh
had paid his own way or at least had warned the governor's strongly
anti-apartheid administration of his plans to make a second visit
to South Africa.
   The governor said he was led to believe, wrongly, that Walsh's
first visit was at the expense of the International Association of
Chiefs of Police.
   Walsh was not available for comment Tuesday. His telephone
number is not listed. But he told The Columbus Dispatch he is
opposed to racial discrimination and saw nothing wrong with the
trip.
   ``I really can't see there is any conflict with my job as a
police officer, as superintendent of the highway patrol,'' Walsh
said. ``I guess the next thing is you won't be able to go to a
library and read a book on South Africa.''
   Walsh, 53, was part of the Highway Patrol for 31 years and was
paid about $54,000 annually. He was appointed superintendent in
1979 by Gov. James A. Rhodes.
   Walsh also was chairman of the Highway Patrol pension fund,
which has interests in companies that do business in South Africa.
   He told the newspaper his trip included a tour of ``both the
slums and the millionaires' homes.''
   Walsh was joined on the most recent trip by Dennis J. Love,
mayor of Maple Heights, a predominantly white Cleveland suburb.
   Love said the purpose of the $18,000-per-person trip was to let
business, civic and political leaders ``see South Africa and
Johannesburg for themselves.''
   ``They want people to see what it's like over there firsthand.
There's no brainwashing,'' he said. ``They did not try to force
anything on us.''

<HEAD>Smaller Union Temporarily Halts Signing Up Social Security Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A union seeking to oust a larger rival as the
representative of more than 60,000 Social Security workers has
withdrawn its initial effort to sign up 12,000 of those federal
employees, union officials said Tuesday.
   The National Treasury Employees Union said its move was
temporary and necessitated by delays in a planned reorganization of
the Social Security Administration that when completed will place
the 12,000 workers under the jurisdiction of regional SSA
commissioners.
   The American Federation of Government Employees, which
represents the majority of Social Security workers and 700,000
federal workers in all, characterized the NTEU's withdrawal of its
effort as a face-saving move. ``Their petition never had merit,''
AFGE President John N. Sturdivant said.
   But NTEU President Robert N. Tobias said the petition was
withdrawn because a Federal Labor Relations Authority official last
week informed the union he could not determine if NTEU had
jurisdiction over the 12,000 workers because the reorganization has
not been completed.
   ``We'll have to wait until management gets its act together but
we intend to continue our effort,'' Tobias said in a statement.
   ``It's not a matter of winning or losing because it's not over
yet,'' NTEU spokesman George King said.
   Among the federal workers represented by NTEU are those at the
regional offices of the Department of Health and Human Services,
the parent agency of SSA. HHS in September announced plans to place
12,000 of the SSA workers under the control of the regional offices
and NTEU since then has asserted it should have jurisdiction over
them.
   NTEU, which has about 145,000 members, has been seeking a
foothold among Social Security workers so it can attempt to
organize the agency's entire work force, part of its larger effort
to chip away at AFGE's lead in representing federal workers.

   President Bush made a small ceremony do double
duty Tuesday as he honored the most recent space fliers and two
groups of school children who picked the winning name for the
newest space shuttle.
   ``We are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our
space program and really of our country itself, of America
herself,'' the president said as he shared a White House stage with
five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth-graders and nine math students
from grades 8-12.
   ``In a sense today's setting reflects the continuity,'' he said.
``You are pioneers pushing back the boundaries of our technological
future.''
   To astronauts David Walker, Ronald Grabe, Norman Thagard, Mark
Lee and Mary Cleave, who returned on May 8 from a four-day shuttle
mission, the president said, ``You've reaffirmed your nation's
genius in science and technology and yet, I think we would all
agree, this really is only just the beginning.''
   The crew on the 29th shuttle flight launched a space probe that
will orbit Venus after an 800-million-mile, 15-month journey and
map the surface of Earth's fog-shrouded sister planet.
   The pupils, from Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss.,
and Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Ga.,. each submitted
the name ``Endeavour,'' for the shuttle being built to replace the
ill-fated Challenger, which exploded after its launch in January
1986.
   ``My friends, choosing a name can be a thankless task,'' said
Bush. ``Consider the new father who was once reproached by Sam
Goldwyn. `You are going to call your son William,' he said. ``What
kind of a name is that? Every Tom, Dick and Harry is called
William.'''
   Endeavour will have the British spelling. It was the name of the
flagship used by James Cook, the 18th century English explorer and
it was chosn from several names by 31 of the 111 state-level
winners.
   Bush recalled that more than 6,100 teams formed by 71,650
students submitted research projects supporting the names they
selected. Panels from state education agencies picked state winners
in the two divisions and Bush made the final selection.

<HEAD>Bush, Budget Leaders Turn to 1991; Some Say New Taxes Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With final approval near on the 1990 federal
budget, President Bush and congressional leaders on Tuesday began
laying groundwork for a fiscal 1991 package that some of the
lawmakers said must include new taxes.
   Bush did not comment on any options presented to him, including
the possibility that new taxes would be needed to meet budget
deficit goals.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The
president's attitude is that he does not want to raise taxes now or
any time, but you consider each budget year as it comes. We did not
raise taxes in 1990; obviously no one wants to do it in 1991.''
   Doing it would also go against Bush's ``Read my lips, no new
taxes'' campaign pledge of last year.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said participants in the meeting made ``some good
progress'' toward discussions on the sticky subjects such as taxes
and spending cuts.
   ``The only specifics that we all discussed there was the fact
that everything is going to have to be on the table _ defense,
entitlements, taxes, all three are going to have to be part of that
kind of package,'' he said after the meeting with Bush.
   ``There weren't any violent reactions,'' said House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas when reporters asked him how Bush had reacted to
suggestions of new taxes.
   Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, the House majority leader, said
administration officials ``have not ruled out discussion of any
options'' but that the White House had sent no signals that it was
willing to look at new taxes.
   ``Next year's budget is going to be monumentally more difficult
than this year's,'' said Wright when he emerged from the meeting
that included Bush's budget team and several Democratic and
Republican lawmakers.
   Several of the members in the meeting told Bush there is no way
they can produce a budget meeting next year's $64 billion deficit
ceiling unless he agrees to new taxes, said those who were present.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said there was general discussion of
options on what must be done next year. He said the group agreed to
``continue the momentum of working together ... to continue serious
discussions about starting soon with a group representing the
leadership that would begin to look seriously at all the options
for the 1991 budget.''
   Wright said the 1990 budget that is expected to get
congressional ratification this week is ``a special case, it's
patchwork that was made possible by agreements that cannot be
duplicated next year.''
   Last month, Bush and congressional leaders agreed on a budget
outline for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Congress has since
produced a budget resolution based on that pact.
   The House is scheduled to consider the compromise $1.2 trillion
budget on Wednesday, and final Senate action is expected late
Wednesday or Thursday.
   Some lawmakers even while signing on to the 1990 package
criticized it for using a ``smoke and mirrors'' approach to meet
the 1990 deficit ceiling of $100 billion.
   Critics say the package relied on unrealistic economic
assumptions that make the deficit seem smaller and on accounting
gimmicks that create little real saving.
   It also includes $5.3 billion in unspecified additional tax
receipts. Bush says $4.8 billion of that can come from cutting the
capital gains tax, but Democrats say his plan is a handout to the
wealthy and a money-loser.

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of 13 governors met with
President Bush on Tuesday to press a list of state concerns and
said the president agreed to call a national summit meeting on
education later this year.
   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles said the governors expressed their
concerns on schools, the environment, roads, crime and welfare
reform in their half-hour private meeting in the Cabinet Room of
the White House.
   ``We told the president that we need a road map, a game plan, if
this country is going to maintain its momentum,'' Baliles, a
Democrat and chairman of the National Governors' Association, said
afterward.
   ``Governors are realistic. They know these issues are not going
to be resolved in 100 days,'' he said. ``But they're also eager for
results. We want to work with Washington, but we're not waiting on
Washington.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, said he had first
suggested a domestic summit meeting of governors and education
leaders when Bush met with the governors after his election in
November, and repeated that request Tuesday.
   He said Bush ``indicated he will host a summit conference on
education ... in September and will be working with the governors
in planing for that.'' He said the meeting would include governors,
state education chiefs and local educators who are trying
innovative approaches to improve learning.
   A recent report by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos ranked the
states in education and concluded education is not improving
overall in the nation.
   Despite that, Branstad said, ``there are exciting and innovative
things happening in many of the states to deal with the education
problems of the nation, and this summit conference is going to give
us an opportunity to share them.''
   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin said that she encouraged Bush to
support strenthening the clean air act and that ``delay is now not
acceptable'' on the issue. She said Bush ``seems to agree with that
fundamental message.''
   Branstad, who will become chairman of the nation's governors
this summer, said he urged more federal effort to help Midwestern
farmers deal with drought, and urged a relaxation of new federal
welfare regulations affecting the states, which he said ``don't fit
the spirit'' of the welfare reform act.
   Bush's meeting with the governors amounted to a make-up session,
since he was out of the country last winter when the National
Governors' Association held its annual Washington conference, which
traditionally includes meetings with the president and dinner at
the White House.
   The president will host the governors at a formal state dinner
Monday night.
   Earlier in the day, the governors' association released a report
by its task force on research and technology, which said states and
the federal government should take steps to promote commercial
appliciations of technological advances that are necessary to make
the United States competitive with other countries.
   It recommended a revision of federal antitrust laws to promote
joint research and development projects by businesses, and renewal
of the federal tax credit for research and development.
   The report said that the nation has spent a declining share of
its gross national product on commercially applicable research and
development in the 1980s, and that federal spending on research has
gone increasingly toward specialized military needs.
   Governors meeting with Bush were Democrats Baliles, Kunin, Mike
Sullivan of Wyoming, Booth Gardner of Washington, Richard Celeste
of Ohio, and Republicans Branstad, Michael Castle of Delaware, John
Ashcroft of Missouri, Norman Bangerter of Utah, Carroll Campbell of
South Carolina, Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island, Thomas Kean of New
Jersey and John McKernan of Maine.

<HEAD>Dukakis Cracks Down on Polluters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drawing personnel from across state government,
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Tuesday launched an environmental strike
force of 33 lawyers, scientists and law officers to bring criminal
charges against polluters.
   State officials plan to use an array of crime-fighting
techniques _ undercover agents, aerial surveillance and search
warrants _ in the pollution crackdown, which they say is the most
sweeping in the nation.
   ``These are violent crimes. They do violence against others,
against houses, against neighborhoods and against the water we
drink and the air we breathe,'' Dukakis said.
   Escorted by dozens of officers, Dukakis stood between the shore
of the Charles River and a new jail to emphasize Massachusetts'
resolve to go after polluters.
   Dukakis aides said the strike force should not be expected to
generate headlines soon because the goal is major investigations
that may take months. But their hope is that a few high-profile
prosecutions will deter polluters.
   Environmental Affairs Secretary John DeVillars, who initiated
the program after being appointed six months ago, said
investigators will concentrate on cases that involve the greatest
costs in terms of cleanup and human health.
   Dukakis aides said they plan to work with the Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. attorney.
   ``The state is thinking big and thinking properly,'' said Elissa
Parker, policy director at the Environmental Law Institute, a
nonprofit research group in Washington.
   She said Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania have strike forces that
concentrate on toxic dumping and water pollution, while
Massachusetts will also include the protection of wetlands and
other habitats.
   Except for those three states, ``there aren't any statewide
initiatives that even come close to what Massachusetts is doing,''
she said.
   Daniel Greenbaum, who heads the state Department of
Environmental Quality Engineering, said up to half the people
discharging pollutants into sewers or the air do not have permits.
Many who have permits violate their limits, he said.
   DeVillars said polluters have ruined 103 water supplies in
Massachusetts, created more than 1,000 toxic dumps and cost the
state $90 million a year in losses from contaminated shellfish beds.
   Joseph Duggan of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce
criticized the strike force as ``all stick and no carrot.''
   ``People who are intentionally disobeying the law, fouling the
land and atmosphere, should be cracked down on and made to pay,''
Duggan said. But others find out after buying property that it was
contaminated and are ordered to clean it up.
   ``We are objecting to that. We don't think it's the right
approach,'' he said.

   The new acting head of NASA moved quickly
Tuesday to fill a key vacancy and told space agency employees he'll
fight against ``potential cuts that could delay, trim down or even
kill'' the proposed space station.
   Richard Truly, who took over as administrator on Monday, named
Samuel W. Keller to be associate deputy administrator, the No. 3
job at the space agency. J.R. Thompson was nominated by President
Bush earlier to be deputy administrator.
   ``I will be filling other top jobs as quickly as I can,'' said
Truly, whose own confirmation hearings are to begin soon. ``I
intend to do all that I can to ensure that NASA continues to
maintain and attract a team dedicated to excellence.''
   Keller has served as deputy associate administrator for space
science and applications since December 1977. He succeeds Dr. Noel
W. Hinners who was one of several NASA officials who resigned
recently because of new post-employment laws and the failure of a
pay raise to pass Congress.
   Truly, in a televised address to all NASA centers, said the
battle over construction of the space station will be especially
difficult.
   ``We can't afford to short-change Space Station Freedom or any
other major program,'' he said. ``To do so would be to deny our own
future as a nation. And I don't believe that President Bush or the
American people want that to happen.''

<HEAD>Politburo Member Denies Corruption Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Politburo member and rival of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev denied a prosecutor's charge of corruption and
said the allegation was politically motivated, it was reported
Tuesday.
   The denial by Politburo member Yegor Ligachev, and his
subsequent charge of mudslinging by the crusading prosecutor,
Nikolai Ivanov, was the latest development to stun Soviets
unaccustomed to hardball political campaigns.
   The official Novosti news agency said Tuesday that Ligachev,
considered a conservative and a potential foe of Gorbachev,
``resolutely denied'' the accusation made Friday by Ivanov in the
prosecutor's final days of an election campaign for the new Soviet
parliament. Ivanov won a seat in the parliament on Sunday.
   Politburo members have been caught in corruption scandals but
ususally they resign and disappear before a whiff of scandal
emerges. It is unusual for a sitting, powerful Communist Party
leader such as Ligachev to be accused of wrongdoing, and even more
unusual for a denial to be published.
   ``Yegor Ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations and
called the attention of the commission to the fact that the
slanderous statement was intended as a political provocation,''
Novosti said in its report sent to The Associated Press by telex in
a message titled ``Televised Disinformation.''
   ``He insists that the case be thoroughly considered and the
results reported in the press,'' Novosti said, citing ``reliable
sources'' for its report on one of the highest officials in the
Kremlin.
   Ivanov helped prosecute a corruption case that led to the
conviction of former Deputy Interior Minister Yuri Churbanov, the
son-in-law of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   In his accusation made on Leningrad TV Friday night, Ivanov said
Ligachev's name had come up in the investigation. He offered no
details.
   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, both are being investigated
for alleged abuses of power by a commission of the Presidium, the
nation's top executive body. Ligachev issued his complaint to that
commission, Novosti said.
   Ivanov and Gdlyan, who won a legislative seat in an earlier
round of elections, became nationally known in a bizarre corruption
case that involved an Uzbek collective farm chairman who kept a pet
lion and a private prison. The scandal spread to include the
president and premier of Uzbekistan and Churbanov.
   Ivanov said on TV that if he were elected, he would do his best
to see that Ligachev _ also a deputy to the new Congress _ is not
chosen a member of the smaller Supreme Soviet that will hold much
of the legislative power.
   The prosecutor won his seat in the new Congress of People's
Deputies with a resounding majority. He campaigned on the slogan,
``No to the Mafia, Yes to Ivanov!'' He emphasized his record as a
prosecutor and called for a national investigative commission to
uproot corruption.
   Election opponents accused him of methods reminiscent of
dictator Josef Stalin, and said they feared he could set off
another round of deadly purges by playing on the public's need to
find scapegoats for the disastrous state of the Soviet economy.
   The Presidium commission investigating Ivanov and Gdlyan was
formed to consider citizens' complaints that the men abused their
power in investigating high-level corruption. Gorbachev chairs the
Presidium.
   Both men reportedly were removed from the corruption
investigation last week. A man who answered Gdlyan's office
telephone Tuesday night said Gdlyan was refusing comment on both
his own investigation of corruption and the Presidium investigation
of him.
   The commission said Saturday in the Communist Party daily Pravda
that the two prosecutors made ``provocative statements'' about
``violations of law'' by some political leaders, and accused them
of trying to disorient people and interfere with the commission.
   A separate investigation by the Supreme Court already has
determined that Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 in
Estonia. The accused, an eminent scientist, died in jail. The
Supreme Court has asked the prosecutor's office to consider
dismissing Gdlyan as a result.

<HEAD>Group Formed to Make Medical Goods for Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six American health care companies have formed
a consortium with the Soviet government to produce badly needed
medical goods for the Soviet Union, the group announced Tuesday.
   ``This is more than an experiment in sharing knowledge and
experience,'' said Dennis Sokol, who is president of the consortium
and chairman of MedServ International Inc., of Stamford, Conn., one
of the American companies.
   The other American companies are Abbott Laboratories Inc.,
Pfizer International Inc., Hewlett Packard Inc., HCA International
Co. and the Colgate-Palmolive Co.
   On the Soviet side are the Soviet ministries of Health, the
Medical and Microbiological Industry and Instrument-making Means of
Automation and Control Systems, the group said in statement.
   Sokol anticipated ``a substantial two-way flow of business for
the first time in this field,'' but said it was too early to
speculate on the volume.
   Although the Soviets claimed for years to have one of the most
advanced health care systems in the world, serious shortcomings
have been revealed under glasnost, including high rates of
alcoholism and infant mortality and a falling life expectancy for
men.
   Consortium members said the group could play a role in the
expansion of medical facilities in the Soviet Union, and quoted
Soviet Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov as saying he expects his
nation to triple health care expenditures by the year 2000.
   Barry MacTaggart, chairman of the consortium and president of
Pfizer, ancitipated that the group would market Soviet health
technologies in the West, but did not explain explain what those
might be.
   ``We expect to get the benefit here in the United States from
the technological developments that have been made in the Soviet
Union in a variety of medical and scientific areas,'' MacTaggart
said in a statement.
   Consortium members did not explain how the American participants
could profit from helping expand medical care in the Soviet Union.
The ruble cannot be converted profitably into western currencies,
and previous U.S. ventures in the Soviet Union have been hampered
by tight Kremlin rules governing how foreign firms can repatriate
their profits.
   The consortium was intended to facilitate the formation of joint
ventures involving U.S. and Soviet participants, and stemmed from
discussions that took place within the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Trade
and Economic Council, a binational group aimed at promoting
commerce between the superpowers.

   A car bomb exploded by remote control as
the spiritual leader of Lebanon's Sunni Moslems drove past on his
way home to lunch Tuesday, killing him and 21 other people and
wounding 75, police reported.
   The explosion in Moslem west Beirut, which Syrian troops patrol,
occurred as Arab League mediators were trying to consolidate a
6-day-old truce in the latest round of fighting.
   Sheik Hassan Khaled, Lebanon's Grand Mufti and the Sunni
spiritual leader, was a leading voice for moderation in a country
devastated by 14 years of factionalism and sectarian civil war.
   Both Christian and Moslem leaders denounced the assassination,
for which there was no claim of responsibility, and declared
periods of mourning.
   Police said Khaled was being driven home from his office at 1
p.m. when the bomb went off in the crowded Aishe Bakkar district.
   Rescuers had to break the doors of Khaled's smashed black
Cadillac to pull out his mutilated body and those of his driver,
his brother-in-law Hussein Bashasheh and an unidentified companion.
   ``Our beloved Mufti is murdered!'' a policeman screamed through
tears as he took Khaled's blood-stained white turban from the
crumpled limousine.
   Firemen doused dozens of smoldering cars. Pools of blood
glistened on the street. The explosion tore the facade of an
adjacent apartment building.
   Among others killed were four bodyguards from the crack Squad 16
riot police who were burned beyond recognition in their charred
jeep, a policeman said.
   ``The assassin, or assassins, used a remote control device to
detonate the car bomb, which was rigged with more than 150
kilograms (330 pounds) of TNT,'' a police spokesman said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States was ``revolted by the cold-blooded killing'' and
described Khaled as ``a selfless leader.''
   Khaled, 68, was spiritual leader of Lebanon's 900,000 Sunni
Moslems and was elected Grand Mufti of Lebanon 23 years ago, making
him the nation's highest- ranking Moslem cleric.
   He guided the economically powerful Sunni sect into advocating
coexistence with Christians and shunning a fighting role in the
sectarian war.
   Lebanon has more Shiite Moslems than Sunnis. Shiites loyal to
Iran are believed to hold most of the 15 foreigners missing in
Lebanon, who include nine Americans, but Sunnis are not believed to
be involved in hostage-taking.
   In the latest battle between Christians and Moslems, which began
March 8, Khaled made several calls for restraint and supported Arab
League efforts for a truce.
   Salim Hoss, acting premier in the Moslem cabinet of Lebanon's
dual goernment, said ``We shall never deviate from the course of
moderation our martyred grand mufti has charted.''
   Hoss, a Sunni, spoke after meeting with senior Sunni politicians
at Khaled's headquaters.
   In September 1984, Khaled and Hoss escaped death by car bomb as
they set out together in a motorocade for prayers marking the
Moslem feast of Al-Adha. Hoss suffered scratches and Khaled was
unscathed.
   Tuesday's bomb exploded only 100 yards from the Hoss residence.
A policeman guarding his home was among the dead.
   Syria's Moslem allies blamed the assassination on Gen. Michel
Aoun, who leads Christian army units in the artillery battle that
began 10 weeks ago with an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse
militiamen.
   The general also heads a Christian cabinet that competes for
authority with the Hoss government.
   He blamed Syria, but did not mention it by name in a statement
saying:
   ``This ugly crime confirms that the hand of terror and
oppression does not refrain from targeting the highest symbols of
moderation that advocate the unity of the nation against the plots
of partition and dismemberment.''
   Aoun called Khaled was ``a great, bold leader'' whose death
should cause Lebanese to ``take a unified stand against the
occupiers of our land.'' Aoun has pledged to continue fighting
until Syria leaves Lebanon, where it has 40,000 soldiers under a
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria sent a condolence telegram
saying: ``This crime was aimed at liquidating this leader because
he fought for the unity and sovereignty of Lebanon and national
understanding.''
   Hoss declared seven days of official mourning for Khaled, who is
survived by his wife, six sons and three daughters. Political and
religious leaders in Christian east Beirut declared a day of
mourning.
   Christian and Moslem radio stations joined in the mourning.
Moslem radios broadcast verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book,
and the Christians played somber music.
   The car bombing was the sixth and worst of the year. By police
count, the previous explosions killed 28 people and wounded 218.

   The assassination of Grand Mufti Hassan
Khaled, spiritual head of Lebanon's Sunni Moslem sect, silenced one
of the few remaining voices of moderation after 14 years of civil
war.
   A spellbinding orator, the 68-year-old Khaled was an unbending
champion of ``dialogue, not the gun'' to re-establish peaceful
coexistence between Moslems and Christians.
   During his 23-year reign as grand mufti, the nation's highest
Moslem religious post, Khaled urged the 900,000 economically
powerful Sunnis to shun any military role in the civil war.
   When the only Sunni militia _ the Mourabitoun, or ambushers _
was disbanded in 1985, Khaled used the powers of his office to
block the emergence of any other Sunni paramilitary faction.
   He was killed on Tuesday when a car bomb exploded in Beirut as
his car drove by. The explosion killed 21 others and injured 75,
police said.
   Khaled was born in 1921 to a middle-class Beirut family. He
finished his high school education at Beirut's College of Islamic
Theology and graduated in 1946 from Al-Azhar University in Cairo,
Egypt, the world's most prestigious Islamic institute.
   Khaled started his career as a teacher of logic at the College
of Islamic Theology in Beirut.
   In 1957, he was appointed an Islamic law judge in Lebanon's
northern province of Akkar and was transfered to a similar position
in central Lebanon.
   On December 1966, he was elected grand mufti. Khaled also headed
the Islamic bloc, a coalition of senior Sunni politicians,
including prime ministers and parliament members.
   Khaled was awarded a honorary doctorate from Al-Azhar University
and the Chinese Gen-Ge University in 1967.
   He wrote seven books and was a member of many regional and
international Islamic institutes.
   He is survived by his wife, six sons and three daughters.
   Khaled escaped a previous assassination attempt when a car bomb
exploded Sept. 5, 1984 as he prepared to drive with Sunni Prime
Minister Salim Hoss for prayers to mark the Adha feast, Islam's
holiest holiday.
   Condolence messages for Khaled poured in.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States was ``revolted by the cold-blooded killing.''
   In Kuwait, Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed, head of the Arab
League committee on Lebanon, condemned it as ``an ugly crime
designed to deepen dissension inside'' Lebanon.
   In a statement distributed by the Kuwait News Agency, Sabah
described Khaled as ``a man of tolerance and justice who was deeply
concerned over the sufferings of the entire Lebanese people.''
   Saudi Arabia issued a statement expressing ``the king's,
government's and nation's extreme sorrow and pain at the tragic
loss.''
   His death made him the fourth Sunni figure to be assassinated in
three years.
   Sheikh Subhi Saleh, 60, a ranking Sunni cleric and staunch
advocate of Moslem-Christian coexistence, was gunned down at west
Beirut's Sakiet el-Janzir neighborhood on October 7, 1986 by masked
assassins riding a motorbike.
   Prime Minister Rashid Karami, 64, was killed in June 1987, when
a bomb exploded aboard the army helicopter that was flying him from
north Lebanon to Beirut.
   Mohammed Shokair, 70, political adviser to former President Amin
Gemayel, was killed by gunmen who stormed his home on Aug. 20, 1987.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing Sons In Foundry Ladle Found Guilty But Mentally

<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was found guilty of murder but
mentally ill Tuesday for killing his two sons in a 1,300-degree
foundry ladle.
   A jury deliberated nearly two hours before returning the verdict
against Bartley James Dobben, 28, in the Thanksgiving 1987 deaths
of 2-year-old Bartley Joel and 15-month-old Peter David at the
foundry where Dobben worked.
   Sentencing was set for June 16.
   The defense contended Dobben, diagnosed a paranoid
schizophrenic, was insane at the time of the slayings. Brett
Gardner, an assistant prosecutor, said Dobben killed his sons
because his marriage of four years was failing.
   According to testimony, Dobben loaded his wife and children in
the car for Thanksgiving dinner at his parents' home but told his
wife he had to get a Bible from his locker at the Cannon-Muskegon
Corp. and show the boys where he worked.
   As Dobben's pregnant wife, Susan, waited outside, Dobben put the
boys in a furnace used to hold molten metal and turned the gas jets
up until the ladle glowed red, authorities said. Autopsies showed
the boys quickly suffocated and burned.
   A jail guard, Deputy Joy Knapp, testified Dobben told her that
``by killing the kids that they would go to heaven.''
   ``Bartley felt it was a spiritual rite he was doing by killing
the kids,''' she said. ``He didn't want his kids to face the trial
and tribulations of today's society.''
   Family and friends portrayed Dobben as a loving, attentive
father who was obsessed with religion, believed the end of the
world was near and was instructed by a self-ordained minister to
stop taking drugs that controlled his behavior.
   Bizarre behavior and suspicions that his wife was unfaithful and
his family in danger resulted in a 60-day, court-ordered stay at a
psychiatric hospital in 1985, according to testimony.
   Mrs. Dobben testified she forgave her husband a day after the
slayings and wants him back home with her. The couple's third son
will be a year old in June. ``He would have given his life for
those kids,'' she testified.

   Police swept through Israeli markets and
industrial plants in an unprecedented move Tuesday, forcing
Palestinian workers who live in the occupied Gaza Strip to go home.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli troops shot and killed two
Palestinians and wounded at least 17, Arab reports said. The army
confirmed one dead and five wounded.
   Also Tuesday, a 50-year-old Palestinian jailed for security
reasons, Mohammed Assad Fukaha, died of dehydration suffered in a
hunger strike at Megiddo prison in northern Israel where he was
held for eight months, military sources said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death.
   Officials said the expulsion of Arab laborers was intended to
punish Gaza residents for anti-Israeli activities in the 17-month
Palestinian uprising.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the order may be widened to
include the occupied West Bank, adding he hoped the penalty would
persuade Palestinians to end their violent campaign against Israeli
rule.
   About 60,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and 50,000 from the
Gaza Strip work in Israel.
   Even a temporary ban could cause severe hardship for Palestinian
laborers, who have few employment opportunities in the occupied
lands.
   ``If I don't go to work or I get sent home, the store owner will
fire me,'' said a Gazan worker in Tel Aviv, speaking on condition
his name not be used. ``Where am I going to get food for my
children?''
   Police Commissioner David Krauss warned on the radio Tuesday
that if Gazans do not leave, ``we will begin detaining workers and
returning them to Gaza.''
   Rabin said: ``The intention is to warn the residents that
permission for free travel and work in Israel are not givens. They
depend on the behavior of those who leave for work.''
   Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron told a parliament committee the
expulsions were ``a punishment measure'' and said Israeli leaders
considered and rejected banning all Palestinian labor in Israel.
   Gaza has been the site of most of the latest stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli soldiers. Police also have said they suspect
Palestinians from Gaza kidnapped one soldier and murdered another
whose body was found last week.
   In Gaza on Tuesday, 13-year-old Yasser Mahmoud El-Dranee died
when shot in the neck by Israeli troops in Jabaliya refugee camp,
hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, troops shot and killed Yassin
Anabulsy, 21, in a clash with stone-throwers, the army said.
   At least 479 Palestinians have died as a result of the uprising
that began in December 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.
   Arab reports said 12 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in
Gaza and five in the West Bank, including a 15-year-old critically
hurt with a bullet wound in the heart.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, stone-throwing attacks on
Jewish settlers' cars were reported. Israel radio said one settler,
injured in the head, fell down and his gun accidentally fired,
hitting another settler in the leg.
   Arab reports said dozens of settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba
later attacked Arab cars in Hebron, breaking windshields and firing
in the air. Troops firing tear gas clashed with stone-throwing Arab
youths shouting ``Allahu akbar!'' (God is great), they said.
   It was uncertain how many Gaza workers police rounded up. Many
could not report to work anyway because an indefinite curfew
declared Monday night confined Gaza's 700,000 residents to their
homes.
   At the Erez crossing into Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian workers
sat on the ground under army guard. They had been transported by
Israeli taxis and were being taken into Gaza by army trucks.
   Paramilitary border police went through Tel Aviv's Carmel Market
demanding Arabs' identity cards. Gaza residents were told to leave
by Tuesday night, witnesses said.
   Dennis Ross, head of policy planning at the State Department,
returned to Israel from talks in Egypt and Jordan on Israel's
proposal to hold elections in the occupied lands as a first step in
a peace process there.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens flew to Washington on Tuesday for
talks with U.S. officials on the plan.
   ``Potential opportunity'' exists for advancing the peace
process, Ross told reporters after talking to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   He also met five Palestinian leaders.

   Narcotics agents arrested a man who
was transporting hashish stuffed inside teddy bears, police said
Tuesday.
   Mikael Malmstedt of Stockholm, Sweden, was arrested in a bus
Thursday near Tublay, in Benguet province, 130 miles north of
Manila, said Col. Virgilio David, chief of the Narcotics Command.
   Police found about 3.3 pounds of powdered hashish concentrate,
worth about $1,900, hidden inside two teddy bears, David said.
   Malmstedt was taken to nearby Baguio, where he faces criminal
charges for trafficking narcotics and a sentence of 20 years to
life in prison, David said.
   Malmstedt was on his way to Baguio from Sagada, a popular
tourist spot, when he was caught, David said.
   Benguet province is a major marijuana and hashish-producing
region.

to help the struggling agricultural sector.
   The protesters blamed government neglect and imports of U.S.
farm products.
   Led by a convoy of vans, the farmers waved banners and chanted
slogans. They handed government officials petitions calling for
subsidies, insurance and retirement allowances and criticized a
government plan to cut tariffs on imports of farm products.
   About 180 farmers, scholars, students and politicians in Japan

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met privately
Tuesday with six congressional supporters of the V-22 Osprey
aircraft project, but they failed to sway his decision to shut down
the program, Pentagon officials said.
   The officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
Cheney met with both of Pennsylvania's senators and four of its
congressmen for about 30 minutes to discuss the embattled project.
   Pennsylvania is the home state for one of the two contracting
partners developing the plane _ the Boeing Helicopter Co. The other
prime contractor is Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   Cheney, in overseeing cuts in the fiscal 1990 Pentagon budget
promised by President Bush, announced last month he was scuttling
the V-22 program as too expensive. Despite intense pressure ever
since, including threats by the contractors to begin immediate
layoffs, Cheney has held firm to that position.
   On Tuesday, Cheney made clear to the lawmakers that he
understood their concerns, ``but nothing has changed; there won't
be any more money for the program,'' one official said.
   The six Pennsylvania legislators were Republican Sens. John
Heinz and Arlen Specter, Republican Reps. Curt Weldon, William F.
Goodling and Don Ritter and Democratic Rep. Thomas Foglietta.
   The V-22 Osprey, described by the Marine Corps as its most
important weapons program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. To do this, it
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel
upward and back.
   The Marine Corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability
to conduct surprise, long-range amphibious assaults. The first of
the planes recently began flight tests in Texas.
   In fashioning the fiscal 1990 budget, Cheney concluded the
Pentagon couldn't afford the plane and the Marine Corps could do
just as well by ordering additional helicopters.
   The Pentagon had earlier planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663
Ospreys, including $1.3 billion in 1990. The department has already
invested $2 billion in the program over a nine-year period.
   Of all of Cheney's budget decisions, the cancellation of the
Osprey has attracted the most intense opposition on Capitol Hill.
The plane is built in the district of House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and also enjoys widespread support among Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Less than a year out of Stanford, the
22-year-old daughter of new Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is
making $60,000 a year as an aide to a congressman who reports owing
at least $100,000 to Jones.
   Charlotte Jones, who holds three titles on the staff or Rep.
Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., said Tuesday ``there is absolutely no
connection'' between her meteoric rise in position and pay on
Robinson's staff and the debt the congressman owes her father.
   Members of Congress involved in current ethics probes said they
also saw nothing that would constitute a violation of House rules.
   ``If she comes to work and does the work, it's not a problem,''
said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who brought the
initial allegations of ethics violations that House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas faces in a separate matter.
   Rep. John T. Myers, the ranking Republican on the ethics
committee now investigating the allegations against Wright, said
``there is no de facto rule'' against hiring a relative of a
campaign contributor or business partner.
   ``There is no problem if she actually does work,'' Myers said.
   Robinson, 47, and Jones, 46, have been friends since the they
attended high school together in North Little Rock. While Jones
took over his father's insurance business and became a
multimillionaire through oil and gas ventures, Robinson turned to
politics with financial backing from Jones.
   In February, Jones purchased the Dallas Cowboys football
franchise for an estimated $140 million.
   The two men own a farm together in Arkansas under the name J.R.
Agricultural Enterprises Inc., of which Robinson is president. And
Robinson listed among his liabilities in his 1987-88 financial
disclosure form a personal loan from Jones of between $100,000 and
$250,000.
   ``I don't know the details of that loan,'' Jones' daughter said
Tuesday. ``But as far as I know, monthly payments on it are being
made.''
   She conceded in an interview that her father's relationship with
Robinson was instrumental in getting her a job on the congressman's
staff as a $31,000 constituent caseworker after graduating from
Stanford last June with a degree in human biology.
   ``I cannot deny that I'm here because of my father,'' she said.
``But it's not the money, it's the motivation that he encouraged in
me. I see no ethical conflict, none whatsoever.''
   She said she has had a close friendship with Robinson back to
when she was in high school and he was a county sheriff and she
interviewed him for a class paper on politics.
   ``I have a different kind of access to him that makes it easier
for me to interrupt him or intervene with him on behalf of somebody
else,'' she said. ``I think he feels secure with me being here.
   Ms. Jones now holds three titles in Robinson's office _
administrative assistant, office manager and press secretary _ as
more of her own doing.
   The average salaries in 1987 _ there have been raises since _
for respective positions were $55,140, $25,900 and $29,000,
according to the Congressional Management Foundation, a non-profit
group that monitors congressional staff pay and provides management
services to Congress.
   However, most congressional employees with a college degree and
under 25 hold jobs such as legislative assistants with an average
pay of $23,800, or legislative correspondent involved with handling
constituent mail and services at an average pay of $18,000,
according to the foundation.
   Robinson could not be reached Monday or Tuesday. But he has
defended earlier her Ms. Jones rapid elevation on his staff, saying
she has performed her tasks ``in an exemplary way'' and adding,
``You don't really expect me to hire one of my enemies, do you?''
   ``I like people with no experience because they're not
opinionated and you can train them the way you want them to be
trained,'' he told The Arkansas Gazette, which first disclosed Ms.
Jones' salary.
   Ms. Jones said she had attempted to discourage Robinson from
boosting her pay from $51,300 to $60,000 in March after raising it
from $31,000 just two months earlier.
   ``I knew how it was going to come out in the media and cause him
political damage, and I didn't think it was worth it,'' she said.
``So I held it back for three weeks until he bantered he'd fire me
if I didn't put it through.''

<HEAD>Virus `Abby' May Be Effective Against Gypsy Moths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A virus called Abby shows promise of being an
effective killer of foliage-eating gypsy moths, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Once the virus is applied, it is transmitted to each new
generation of moths, said entomologist Martin Shapiro of the
department's Agricultural Research Service.
   The agency and the Forest Service plan to field test the Abby
virus this summer in western Maryland. Scientists will count the
number of dead moth larvae and measure the amount of foliage that
was protected.
   Shapiro said if Abby passes the tests, the virus could become an
alternative to either Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria or
diflubenzuron, a chemical, presently used against the moths by
keeping them from reaching adulthood.
   Shapiro, who has worked on the virus strain for about seven
years at the agency's insect patholoy laboratory in Beltsville,
Md., named the new virus Abby after the town where it was found,
Abington, Mass.
   The Abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus, or
NPV, around the world. The NPV strains infect gypsy caterpillars
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees.
   But Shapiro said the Abby virus demonstrated in laboratory tests
that it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the
standard NPV, which has been used for two years by the National
Park Service in selected areas of Rock Creek Park in Washington,
D.C.
   Park officials said that wherever NPV was sprayed there was
``little or no defoliation'' to the trees. Shapiro said: ``And that
was the natural strain, not Abby.''
   Gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious
eaters of foliage. They have gradually spread from Massachusetts,
where they were imported in 1869 by a French biologist to breed
with native American silkworms.
   But the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating
foliage. The scientist, Louis Trouvellot, returned to France and
pursued a career in astronomy.

<TEXT>
   New federal ethics rules placing strict
restrictions on post-government employment will be held up for 60
days under a delay signed by President Bush on Tuesday.
   The new regulations, which some officials have blamed for a
spate of resignations in various government agencies, including the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon,
were to have taken effect Tuesday.
   But Bush signed legislation to postpone the measures until July
16 after both the House and Senate approved that request by the
Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget.
   The new rules would ban federal contractors from hiring
government officials who have supervised their competitors'
projects, subject to maximum fines of $1 million and imprisonment
of up to five years.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the House Committee
on Government Operations, said the purpose for the delay was to
give government and industry officials ``an opportunity to train
their personnel regarding the new regulations.''
   He said the administration and industry representatives assured
his committee that they would not use the extension period ``to
seek legislative repeal or modification'' of the new ethics law.
   Thomas L. Moser, acting chief of NASA's space station program,
blamed the new ethics regulations for being too restrictive when he
tendered his recent resignation.
   The new rules are the result of legislation passed by Congress
last year. However, the administration did not issue final
regulations until last Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Sandra Day O'Connor remains the Supreme
Court's only millionaire, a distinction she's held since 1987,
according to financial disclosure forms released Tuesday.
   But the court's newest justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, may have
edged closer to millionaire status within the last year.
   O'Connor is still the wealthiest justice by far. The total
wealth listed for O'Connor and her husband, a lawyer, was from $1.3
million to $2.6 million and up.
   The Ethics in Government Act, under which the statements are
filed each year, requires only broad ranges of value for the
reporting of investments and other assets. It does not require that
any asset worth less than $1,000 be listed, nor the value of
personal property items and the official's residence.
   The statement filed for O'Connor last year listed assets of $1.3
million to $2.3 million or more.
   Kennedy, who joined the court in February 1988, listed assets
for himself and his wife, a former teacher, of $348,000 to
$929,000. The report he submitted last year for 1987 listed assets
of $348,000 to $920,000.
   Kennedy, who taught at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento,
Calif., while a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
reported receiving $31,900 from the school in 1988.
   He said he received $24,900 in salary, $5,000 in sabbatical pay
and a $2,000 honorarium for delivering a commencement speech.
   Kennedy also received one of the more unusual gifts reported by
any justice _ a golf bag and clubs from Sacramento residents Tom
LoPresti and Ken Morton. He estimated that the gift was worth $400.
   Among some of the other noteworthy information included in this
year's disclosure forms:
   _Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist earned $9,000 in honoraria
for three law school speeches. He donated $3,000 of that money to
various charities.
   _Justice Antonin Scalia ranked No. 1 in honoraria for 1988,
receiving $23,000 for 10 speaking or teaching engagements. No
charitable donations were listed.
   _Justice Thurgood Marshall, who over the years has listed his
only asset as a savings account worth less than $50,000, pegged the
account's worth in 1988 at $50,000 to $100,000.
   The court's eight associate justices are paid $110,000 a year.
The chief justice's annual salary is $115,000.
   Here are the listed 1988 assets of the justices:

<HEAD>Vatican Asks Tougher Laws on Pornography in Media</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Tuesday urged authorities
worldwide to pass tough new laws and enforce existing ones to halt
what it says is an alarming rise in pornography and violence in the
media. It supported boycotting sponsors of offending programs.
   ``The right to freedom of expression does not exist in a
vacuum,'' it said in a 13-page document issued after a five-year
study by the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.
   The document, titled ``Pornography and Violence in the
Communications Media: A Pastoral Response,'' holds that the media
have become a vehicle for a warped outlook on life, the family,
religion and morality.
   ``The legitimate rights to free expression and free exchange of
information must be respected, but so must the rights of
individuals, families and society to privacy, public decency and
the protection of basic values,'' it said.
   ``Sound laws must be enacted where they are lacking. Weak laws
must be strengthened and existing laws must be enforced.''
   The document cited no specific cases and named no countries.
   The council president, American Archbishop John P. Foley, and
secretary, Italian Monsignor Pierfranco Pastore, also declined at a
news conference to identify specific films, programs or
publications considered pornographic or identify particular
countries.
   But Foley criticized films such as some Kung Fu movies that
depict violence for the sake of violence and scenes where
individuals appear to enjoy inflicting physical harm on others.
   ``That is a type of violence that is really disgusting and can
give individuals terrible ideas to act out,'' he said.
   Some soap operas and other TV offerings in Latin America are
becoming more and more explicit and some in the United States are
suggestive, he said.
   ``These dramatic programs can certainly reflect moral evil ...
that is part of reality, but they shouldn't glamorize evil and make
evil something which is to be desired,'' he said.
   The document condemned pornography as a violation of human
dignity and rights and of Christian values. It said the media,
lured by profits, ``tragically succumbed to the temptation of
exploiting human weakness.''
   ``Pornography and sadistic violence debase sexuality, corrode
human relationships, exploit individuals ... undermine marriage and
family life, foster anti-social behavior and weaken the moral fiber
of society itself,'' it said.
   ``Even soft-core pornography can have a progressively
desensitizing affect, gradually rendering individuals morally numb
and personally insensitive to the rights and dignity of others.
   ``Exposure to pornography can also be _ like exposure to
narcotics _ habit- forming and can lead individuals to seek
increasingly hard-core and perverse material.''
   Foley said the church wants to express solidarity with families
and particularly with women, who he said feel themselves to be the
special victims of pornography and violence in the media.
   He said the church supports groups such as those in the United
States that organized boycotts of sponsors of programs they
consider offensive.
   ``It is their right to do so, and if they feel certain things
are damaging to their children perhaps it is even their duty to do
so,'' he said.
   Foley said the media should police themselves through
professional codes, that the church needs to maintain a ``clear and
constant'' teaching of the faith and that parents should provide
children with healthy attitudes toward sexuality and a basic sex
education.
   ``A fundamental reason for the spread of pornography or violence
in the media would seem to be a pervasive moral permissiveness,
rooted in the search for personal gratification at any cost,'' the
council said.
   ``The more sexual activity is considered as a continuing
frenzied search for personal gratification rather than as an
expression of enduring love and marriage, the more pornography can
be considered as a factor contributing to the undermining of
wholesome family life.''
   The council said willing participation in producing or
disseminating pornography can only be judged as a serious moral
evil.

   The White House said Tuesday it was ``very
leery'' about a promised halt in Soviet weapons shipments to
Nicaragua and accused Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
acting like a ``drugstore cowboy'' offering one arms control
proposal after another.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Gorbachev
had privately told the United States that Moscow was stopping its
arms shipments to the leftist Sandinista government in Managua.
   However, he said there was no evidence of any cutoff and that
military supplies still were going into Nicaragua.
   On the other hand, Fitzwater said the weapons being received now
might simply have been in the pipeline when Gorbachev made his
promise or might be coming in from another country, such as Cuba.
   ``I'm willing to leave the door open on the idea that maybe that
evidence (of continuing military shipments) is misleading,''
Fitzwater said.
   Other administration sources said later there was ``preliminary
evidence'' that Nicaragua had received 17 shipments of military
goods from the Soviet Union and its allies in the first four months
of this year. The value was estimated at $80 million.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said they were unable
to determine what the shipments contained and whether the source
was the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe or Cuba. The officials
cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions.
   Referring to the letter, one official said ``if implemented,
this would be good news and an acknowledgement that the Soviets may
be willing to support our diplomatic effort to bring democracy and
peace to Nicaragua, and an end to subversion in the region.''
   Emphasizing that the Soviet Union has not made any public
statements to back up its private promises, Fitzwater said: ``We
are very leery of their intentions. ... We're reluctant to be
positive about this because we didn't receive the kinds of public
commitments or the kinds of visual ones that we would like to see.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Latin American affairs,
said it would be ``an extremely important breakthrough'' if
Gorbachev was in fact ending military aid to Nicaragua.
   ``And that ought to be treated seriously and not treated as if
it were humor,'' Dodd said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said, ``It's high time that
the Soviet Union does stop supplying military support to Nicaragua''
   ``It has to come,'' Wright said as he left a White House meeting
with President Bush on the budget. ``If we're really to
demilitarize the zone we really do need to get foreign interests
out of there.''
   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, called it
``a very welcome decision.''
   The promised cutoff in Soviet aid put new pressure on the Bush
administration to counter a string of arms control proposals by
Gorbachev, the most recent of which calls for the removal of 500
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Fitzwater accused Gorbachev of playing a ``PR game'' in contrast
to what he described as the ``very careful and methodical''
approach by the United States to examine its relationship with the
Soviet Union.
   ``We contrast that _ which is an admittedly cautious approach _
to the one of throwing out in a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion
one arms control proposal after another,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the Soviet offers, upon examination, appear to be
``either very little change from the existing situation involving
promises that have been made in the past, involving reductions that
are not meaningful in terms of our strategic relationship with the
Soviet Union or reductions that are not meaningful in terms of
NATO.''
   The Soviet offers have inflamed tensions within NATO over
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. Backed by other members of
the Western Alliance, West Germany has called for East-West
negotiations soon on reducing the weapons.
   However, the United States, supported largely by England, has
adamantly opposed such negotiations on grounds that nuclear weapons
are needed to offset the big advantage in conventional forces
enjoyed by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   With the dispute threatening to mar the unity of a NATO summit
May 29-30, Fitzwater said Bonn and Washington have not been able to
reach an agreement.
   ``We have not reached a compromise at this point,'' he said.
``It's difficult to say whether or not we will but we continue to
discuss the matter with them.''
   An administration official said the promise of a Soviet aid
cutoff to Nicaragua was contained in a letter from Gorbachev to
Bush. It arrived in Washington before Secretary of State James A.
Baker III left for talks in Moscow early last week.
   The United States estimates the Soviet Union gave Nicaragua $515
million in military aid last year, including attack helicopters and
other weapons.
   Fitzwater said preliminary estimates indicate the Sandinistas
have received ``several shipments'' of military goods worth
``millions of dollars'' this year although he was unclear about the
source of the aid.
   U.S. intelligence shows that Nicaragua received 17 shipments of
military goods from Soviet bloc sources since the beginning of the
year, with a value estimated at $80 million, said an administration
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   That compares with some $130 million to $150 million worth
received by the Sandinistas in the first half of last year,
indicating a somewhat slower rate this year.

<HEAD>New NHTSA Probes Involve More Than 4 Million Cars, Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal engineers have opened investigations
into reports of safety defects in potentially 4 million cars and
trucks made in the United States and abroad, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday.
   The 10 new investigations were preliminary evaluations, the
lowest level of probe, of alleged problems in vehicles made by
major automakers.
   NHTSA said it was looking into seven complaints of engine
problems that reportedly caused fires in the 1986-88 Yugo GV, an
import from Yugoslavia.
   The unconfirmed complaints suggested the possibility of a
problem with the carburetor or fuel system, NHTSA said. There were
110,000 vehicles involved in the investigation, the agency said.
   Also, the 1985-89 Yugo GV was among nearly 2 million cars and
trucks that were the subject of new investigations into
malfunctioning brakes, NHTSA said.
   The agency said it had received two complaints, one involving an
accident, in which a front brake pad fell out, becoming stuck in
the assembly and affecting the car's ability to brake. About
100,000 vehicles were involved, NHTSA said.
   The other brake investigations involved vehicles made by General
Motors Corp.
   NHTSA said it was investigating 26 reports that the brakes in
1.5 million GM light trucks tend to pull to the left or right. The
models involved are the 1984-86 C123, K1 and K2; the 1987-88 R123,
V1 and V2; and the 1984-88 G123 pickup trucks.
   The 75,000 1988 Pontiac Lemans, according to six complaints, is
prone to weak braking. The complaints included one accident with
four injuries.
   The agency also opened preliminary evaluations into alleged
problems with the brake lamp switch on 100,000 GM 1988-89 C- and
K-series trucks and on 200,000 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity cars, based
on service bulletins issued by the company.
   Other preliminary evaluationswere into unconfirmed reports that:
   _The fuel-tank strap tends to break on 1.4 million 1981-89 Dodge
pickup trucks. The agency received 2 complaints.
   _The speed control is slow to disengage in cold weather on the
1985 Ford Mustang, Capri, Tempo and Topaz. The agency had nine
complaints.
   _The horn won't work properly on 530,000 1985-89 GM Minivan,
Astro and Safari vehicles. There were four complaints.
   The agency also opened an investigation to determine why Volvo
had changed the fuel tank and driveshaft design in its 700 series.
The investigation covers 175,000 1988-89 vehicles.

<HEAD>Pan Am Has Lost $60 Million in Revenue Because of Flight 103 Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am has lost more than $60 million in
revenue because of the bombing of Flight 103 over Scotland last
December, the company's chairman said Tuesday.
   Thomas G. Plaskett said the worst losses appear to be over but
that the threat of terrorism against U.S. and other government
policies continues and governments should begin paying for a
greater share of aviation security.
   The U.S. government, Plaskett said in a speech to an aviation
industry group, should ``stop putting the financial burden on the
backs of either the industry or the traveling public.''
   The Bush administration has ordered airlines to pay the expected
$100 million cost of installing devices to detect plastic
explosives at high-risk airports around the world. But a bill is
pending in Congress to use federal funds for the units.
   The Dec. 21 bombing of Flight 103, which killed all 259 people
aboard the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, has
been traced to a plastic bomb concealed in a checked-in
radio-cassette player.
   Plaskett said Pan Am lost $60 million in the first quarter of
1989 and more in April after some U.S. companies advised employees
not to fly on U.S. carriers in Europe because of the threat of
terrorist attacks.
   Plaskett said 12 of the last 14 terrorist incidents against
civil aviation involved non-U.S. carriers.
   He said Pan Am spends close to $45 million a year on security,
compared with an average of $10 million for foreign carriers whose
governments usually share the expense. All U.S. airlines, he said,
spend about a half-billion dollars a year on security.
   He said U.S. airlines X-ray or hand-search all checked baggage,
deny passengers access to checked baggage, carry only bags that can
be matched to passengers aboard the aircraft and give additional
screening to passengers who fit a risk profile.

   Federal authorities arrested at least 26
people, including two Panamanian nationals, during a crackdown
Tuesday on a major drug ring that operated here and in Los Angeles
and New York, authorities said.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens estimated the organization
distributed up to 50 kilograms of 98 percent pure cocaine and crack
every month. The FBI estimated the drugs' value at $6 million
monthly.
   The action came four days after a grand jury handed up a
112-count indictment charging 32 persons with narcotics trafficking
and conspiracy.
   Stephens said authorities on Tuesday seized four kilograms of
cocaine, thousands of dollars in cash, five cars, three houses and
several guns.
   The organization's alleged kingpins were Panamanian nationals
Marcos Loinas Anderson and Gabriel Davis-Munoz, Stephens said. He
would not dismiss a possible connection between the two and
Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, but said it
would be ``speculation.''
   Officials suspect the drugs originated in Colombia and were
transported through Panama on commercial air lines to Los Angeles
and New York, using Panamanian and Jamaican immigrants as couriers.
   From there, the narcotics were moved by car to the Washington
area and in lesser degrees to Colorado Springs, Colo., and Killeen,
Texas, said FBI agent W. Douglas Gow.
   All of the suspects were charged with conspiracy and face a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment and $4 million in fines,
Stephens said.

<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and
the American Civil Liberties Union, bitter foes in the past, joined
forces Tuesday to endorse freedom of expression on American college
campuses.
   The unlikely alliance was prompted by the settlement of a
lawsuit pitting California State University at Northridge against
James Taranto, a conservative former editor of the university's
student newspaper.
   Taranto was suspended from the news editor's job at the Daily
Sundial in 1987 after he wrote an opinion piece criticizing UCLA
officials for their handling of a controversy over affirmative
action.
   Taranto also reprinted a cartoon from the UCLA student newspaper
that satirized affirmative action.
   Meese once called the ACLU a ``criminals lobby'' and as a deputy
district attorney in 1964 had supervised the arrest of more 700
student demonstrators on the University of California's Berkeley
campus during the ``Free Speech Movement.''
   On Monday, he attended a news conference at the ACLU's
headquarters in Washington with Taranto and ACLU Director Morton
Halperin.
   ``I disagree with the ACLU on many of their policies,'' Meese
said. ``But I have never said they should not be free to espouse
them. I don't see anything inconsistent with encouraging them when
they do what is right.''
   The university should be ``a citadel of free speech,'' Meese
said, regardless of whether the views expressed are liberal or
conservative.
   Halperin said, ``We're happy to have any allies we can get on
any issue. We're delighted to have (Meese) come and express support
for First Amendment rights on campuses.''
   He added that he was particularly pleased that Meese gave his
support to the ACLU's approach to dealing with controversial
subjects. ``The remedy here is more speech, not to suppress
speech,'' Halperin said.
   The ACLU continues to believe university officials ``should
speak out'' against racist or anti-minority views when they are
expressed in student publications, Halperin said. But ``they should
not use the coercive powers of the university to censor'' those
views, he said.
   Taranto is now a public relations assistant at the conservative
Heritage Foundation here, where Meese also is employed. Taranto
said he invited Meese to attend Tuesday's news conference and the
former attorney general ``readily agreed.''
   Taranto's article in the Daily Sundial in March 1987 said UCLA
officials had helped ``stifle dissent about the issue of
affirmative action.''
   The cartoon first printed in the UCLA newpspaer, the Daily
Bruin, and reprinted to accompany Taranto's article depicted a
rooster saying he was admitted to UCLA under its affirmative action
program to help minorities.
   Taranto was suspended as editor by Cynthia Rawitch, the faculty
adviser to the student newspaper at California State. She said he
had violated a school policy requiring consultation with the
faculty adviser before running controversial articles.
   Taranto said he had been punished for his conservative views
and, with the help of the ACLU, sued the university on grounds his
free-speech rights had been violated.
   ``Campus leftists are attempting to silence conservative
students through censorship and intimidation,'' Taranto said.
   Under the settlement to the suit announced Tuesday, the
university agreed to give Taranto $93 in back pay for the two-week
suspension and remove the reference to his suspension from his
university records.
   The university also amended its policy on publication of
controversial articles in the Daily Sundial. It agreed to declare
the newspaper a ``public forum'' and permit publication of
controversial material without the faculty adviser's permission
unless the material could be obscene, libelous or invade someone's
privacy.
   Michael Emery, head of the university's journalism department,
said in a telephone interview he considers the settlement fair for
both sides.
   ``Everybody now knows exactly where they stand,'' he said. Emery
described the incident involving Taranto's article as ``a real
quirky deal'' and said the university always has stood for freedom
of expression.
   The cartoon caused ``holy hell'' when it was printed in the UCLA
newspaper, he said. ``There could have been a similar explosion at
our school.''
   But Emery said in the future the student-run newspaper would be
free to run such material without consulting with the faculty
adviser.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Rebels Launch Major Offensive on Khost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marxist government said on Tuesday
that Moslem guerrillas abandoned their quest to capture the eastern
city of Jalalabad and opened a major offensive on the southern
border town of Khost.
   At least 1,193 guerrillas were killed since the Khost attack
began Sunday, including 723 since Monday, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mohammad Amani said.
   Amani said the armed forces responded with heavy artillery and
air strikes to a frontal assault by 9,000 guerrillas and fired
dozens of Scud-B missiles from bases in Kabul, the capital, about
250 miles north of Khost.
   Rebels fired seven rockets into Kabul on Tuesday, and one hit a
gate at a terminal at Kabul Airport, killing three people, Amani
said. He said no other casualties resulted.
   Rain and low cloud cover grounded Afghan warplanes, allowing the
insurgents hiding in the surrounding mountains to move closer to
Kabul, he said. Military transport and civilian flights were
canceled.
   The guerrillas, armed by the United States, Saudi Arabia and
China and based in neighboring Pakistan, have tried for 11 years to
topple the Soviet-backed government.
   The rebels control much of the Afghan countryside, but not the
cities. Capturing a city would give them a base for the interim
government they formed in Pakistan in February.
   The guerrillas launched a major assault in early March on
Jalalabad, 45 miles from Pakistan. After surrendering several key
outposts early in the attack, government troops beat back the
guerrillas in a counterattack.
   According to Amani, government forces began sweeping through the
southwestern part of Jalalabad on Monday to clear out rebels. He
said 35 guerrillas were killed and 34 wounded. Eight civilians also
were wounded.
   Military officials have said 500 civilians were killed and 3,000
wounded during the siege.
   Amani said that having failed to capture Jalalabad, the
guerrillas attacked Khost, about six miles from the Pakistan border.
   ``They were expecting a quick victory in Jalalabad, but they
found this was very difficult,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman
said. ``Now they have failed and given up and begun an attack on
Khost.
   ``Time and again, they have claimed to control much of the
country, but they control no city. They were totally defeated in
Jalalabad and now they will be defeated in Khost.''
   Unlike Jalalabad, Khost has no major airport or
telecommunications center, but contains one of the country's
strongest military bases, Amani said.
   About 80,000 people live in the Khost district, a major
agricultural center.
   Amani said the main road between Kabul and Khost cuts through
rugged terrain and can be easily blocked.
   He said insurgents staged hit and run attacks in northern Konduz
province. Soldiers killed two rebels and wounded 28 without
suffering casualties, he said.

   The half million students affected by a
strike in the nation's second-largest school district held raucous
demonstrations, played hooky or dawdled through a second day of
classes Tuesday with too few teachers.
   ``To even pretend any teaching was going on would be short of
ridiculous,'' said Don Schrack, a spokesman for United Teachers-Los
Angeles, which represents about 22,000 teachers, counselors, nurses
and librarians.
   Informal talks were continuing, but negotiators appeared to be
awaiting a report due Wednesday from a state fact-finder, who began
investigating the claims of both sides last March when negotiations
reached an impasse in the 16-month contract dispute.
   Hundreds of boisterous students marched out of Benjamin Franklin
High School in Highland Park and faced off briefly with police
after a patrol car was pelted with rocks.
   Students left Belmont High School to picket the school
district's downtown headquarters.
   ``My father's a teacher, he works overtime constantly and I
don't think he gets paid enough,'' said Mercedes Chavez, 18, whose
father, Rudy, teaches English at Belmont. She had been marching at
the district headquarters for three hours with her 15-month-old
daughter, Dominique.
   Among those carrying a picket sign Tuesday was Garfield High
School calculus teacher Jaime Escalante, whose portrayal in the
film ``Stand And Deliver'' has made him probably the city's
best-known instructor.
   ``I have to support them 100 percent, because I feel that we
deserve better pay and professional pay if we look for quality
education,'' said Escalante.
   ``Without additional teachers it's going to be very, very
difficult'' to finish the final weeks of the semester and grade
students fairly, said Gabriel Cortina, a Los Angeles Unified School
District associate superintendent.
   He made a plea for more substitutes, which the district hopes to
lure with higher than usual pay, $167 instead of $137 a day.
   The higher pay outraged picketing teachers.
   ``It's demeaning to be treated like that,'' said Dale Tropp, a
teacher at an elementary school.
   ``I make about half what the substitutes are making today,''
said Susan Perry, a third-grade teacher.
   On Monday, substitute teacher Randy Kiyabu arrived at Narbonne
High School in a white, chauffeured limousine as a way of outraging
strikers.
   Students at San Fernando High School took up a collection of $95
for one substitute who said he only took the job because he needed
the money. The unidentified teacher left after he was handed the
cash.
   There were no immediate figures Tuesday on attendance by the
district's nearly 540,000 students or on the number of teachers who
crossed picket lines.
   Schools spokeswoman Diana Munatones told reporters, ``We do have
a trend established that a lot of teachers are returning to the
classroom.''
   ``Our estimates are that 73 to 83 percent of the teachers are
out,'' said union spokeswoman Catherine Carey, adding, ``We don't
see any significant attrition.''
   The teachers are demanding a 21 percent pay increase in two
years. They also want relief from unpaid duties such as playground
patrol, and greater control in choosing curricula.
   The district most recently offered a 21.5 percent pay increase
over three years and has promised to set up teachers' councils at
individual schools on curricula.
   Teachers in the district earn from $23,440 in beginning salary
to $43,319 for those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 19
years' experience.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy on Tuesday blocked a 15-year-old girl from obtaining an
abortion without the consent of her parents or a judge.
   In effect, Kennedy reinstated a 1988 state law that had been
struck down as unconstitutional by a Florida appeals court.
   His ruling means a minor seeking an abortion in Florida will
still have to get permission from her parents or a judge until at
least Thursday, when the full U.S. Supreme Court reviews Kennedy's
decision at a conference.
   Kennedy acted, without comment, after the Florida Supreme Court
earlier in the day decided to allow the girl and all other minors
in Florida to obtain abortions without adult consent until the
Florida justices hear arguments on the matter in September.
   Kennedy's action will stand only until the full court considers
it. The justices could continue to keep the law in effect until
they decide whatever constitutional issues may be involved.
   Another option would be to lift Kennedy's stay and let the
decision of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach stand
until the federal justices or the state Supreme Court rule on the
merits.
   ``I think we are examining a law that needs to be examined, that
needs to be very clear for the trial courts,'' said Jerri Blair,
the girl's lawyer, before Kennedy ruled. ``Ultimately, what will
happen, it will cause the Legislature to revisit and clarify the
guidelines.''
   Fourteen states, including Florida, have consent laws but two
are unenforced and three have been blocked by courts, said Kathryn
Kolbert, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in New York City.
   In 12 other states, Ms. Kolbert said, parents only have to be
notified about the abortion, but that is not enforced in four
states and courts have blocked the laws in five other states.
   In February, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Kentucky to begin
enforcing a 1986 parental notification law. The justices, without
comment, turned down an emergency request by abortion-rights
activists seeking to block the law.
   This time, the request for an emergency stay was filed by a
lawyer appointed to represent the interest of the fetus.
   ``Certainly time is of the essence, and that can be determined
from the flurry of activity,'' said attorney Richard Boylston of
Tavares.
   The girl is 12 weeks pregnant, and many clinics won't perform
abortions after the 13th week because of a greater risk of medical
complications, Ms. Blair said.
   ``It's our view that it's highly inappropriate that a lawyer
should be appointed for the fetus,'' said Ms. Kolbert. She said the
ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the court brief with the state
Supreme Court, may do the same in the nation's high court.
   The National Organization for Women issued a statement in
Washington that read in part: ``Every passing day has the potential
of making an abortion more difficult and possibly dangerous, if not
impossible, for the young woman whose life has become a judicial
football.''
   Those following the case said Kennedy's action caught them by
surprise, and they could not immediately analyze what it might mean
to abortion-consent laws around the nation.
   ``I have no idea whatsoever what is going on,'' said Charlene
Carres, counsel for Florida's branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Others noted that the final disposition of such state laws as
Florida's would have to await results of a U.S. Supreme Court
review of a Missouri case in which it could revise the Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion in 1973.
   State Rep. Daniel Webster, a Republican who sponsored the
abortion consent law last year, called the state court's ruling
striking down the abortion consent law ``only temporary'' and said,
``We're looking at a broader picture.''
   The Florida law requires unmarried girls under 18 to obtain the
consent of their parents or a judge.
   In the case in which Kennedy acted, a girl petitioned a court
May 2 for permission to get an abortion. She said she could not
approach her parents without fear of emotional or physical abuse.
   Two days later, Circuit Judge Jerry T. Lockett denied the
petition, saying the law was unworkable because it is
unconstitutionally vague and does not let judges hold proper
hearings. The case then went to the appeals court, which struck
down the law.
   Of approximately 75,000 abortions performed in Florida last
year, about a third were on minors, according to abortion-rights
activists.
   Since the law took effect in February, few teen-agers have gone
through the courts to seek a judge's permission for an abortion.
   Janis Compton-Carr, executive director of the Florida Abortion
Rights Action League, said many youngsters are going to Georgia to
get abortions.
   The NOW statement noted Kennedy, the high court's newest member,
has not yet ruled on an abortion case but his decision to block the
Florida ruling bears out the group's suspicion that he is ``hostile
to the constitutional concept oulthood.
   Shapiro, who has worked on the virus strain for about seven
years at the agency's insect pathology laboratory in Beltsville,
Md., named the new virus Abby after the town where it was found,
Abington, Mass.
   The Abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus, or
NPV, around the world. The NPV strains infect gypsy caterpillars
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees.
   But Shapiro said the Abby virus demonstrated in laboratory tests
that it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the
standard NPV, which has been used for two years by the National
Park Service in selected areas of Rock Creek Park in Washington,
D.C.
   Park officials said that wherever NPV was sprayed there was
``little or no defoliation'' to the trees. Shapiro said: ``And that
was the natural strain, not Abby.''
   Gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious
eaters of foliage. They have gradually spread from Massachusetts,
where they were imported in 1969 by a French biologist to breed
with native American silkworms.
   But the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating
foliage. The scientist, Louis Trouvellot, returned to France and
pursued a career in astronomy.

<HEAD>Administration Raises Pressure for More Veterans' Spending</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration pressured House
Democrats on Tuesday to quickly provide $340 million for veterans'
health programs and warned lawmakers that adding extra spending to
the measure would prompt a presidential veto.
   The money is in a multibillion-dollar domestic spending bill for
this year that continued to be snarled because of differences over
hundreds of millions of dollars it contains for anti-drug programs.
   In a letter to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie
Whitten, D-Miss., Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
said that failure to provide the money soon would result in delayed
purchases of medical equipment and a gradual reduction in the
department's work force.
   ``Each day that supplemental funding is not forthcoming, the
level of service provided by the VA's medical system is
diminished,'' he wrote.
   Letters were also directed to Whitten and House leaders by the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the Paralyzed
Veterans of America, each of which urged quick passage of the
legislation.
   ``To be blunt, veterans are being placed in life-threatening
situations,'' the Veterans of Foreign Wars said.
   Agency officials have previously warned that veterans' hospitals
will begin running out of money in late May.
   The money is for the 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. With
Congress' Memorial Day recess coming up, lawmakers are reluctant to
leave town without having provided the veterans' money.
   But the hangup continued to be $822 million for new prisons,
extra law officers and other anti-drug initiatives, which the
administration has argued can wait until next year.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations justice
subcommittee, has said the money is needed and argued that
Republicans should be forced to demonstrate how resolutely they
support President Bush's efforts against drugs.
   He has proposed paying for much of the spending with parts of
the $650 million the government expects to collect in fines from
the Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   In a policy statement it issued Tuesday, the administration said
it believed Smith's financing plan ``is not valid'' because it
would still add to the deficit.
   Leading members of the Appropriations Committee met among
themselves and with the Democratic House leadership for much of the
day, but were unable to work out a solution to the problem.
   ``Everybody keeps working on all kinds of alternatives,'' Smith
said.
   A $4.7 billion version of the bill was pulled off the House
floor last month after objections were raised over its cost.
   The leadership of the Appropriations Committee has reduced the
measure's price tag to about $3.2 billion, excluding the drug
spending, according to one government source who asked to not be
identified.

<HEAD>Experts Recommend Government Shift Focus to Crime's Effect on Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts on violence involving children urged a
House panel Tuesday to shift its focus from stiffening penalties
for criminals to minimizing the effect on children of witnessing
violent crime.
   But legislators were not receptive to that message, which came
one day after President Bush unveiled an extensive anti-crime
package.
   The experts told the House Select Committee on Children, Youth
and Families that federal efforts to reduce violence by and against
children should work to dispel myths about crime, especially in
inner-city black communities.
   The government also should restructure the education system to
emphazize values and offer viable employment and recreational
options to youth, the experts testified.
   The experts received little encouragement from federal lawmakers.
   ``Your recommendations are really out of kilter with where
politicians are headed,'' said Rep. George Miller, chairman of the
panel.
   The California Democrat said most of his fellow congressmen are
``getting on the bandwagon heading down the road of stiffer and
stiffer penalties.''
   Dr. Carl C. Bell, a Chicago psychiatrist, warned that many
children who regularly witness extreme violence don't get the
counseling they need to lessen their risk of becoming victims or
perpretrators of crime.
   ``What we need to consider is that a lot of the educational
problems and behavioral disturbances that I see among young black
children ... may very well be due to the fact that they've
witnessed violence and are suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder similar to what Vietnam Veterans suffered,'' said Bell.
   He warned that myths and misconceptions about homicides in the
black community are being heightened by media focus on sensational
incidents.
   ``Many blacks think it's white policemen who have killed the
majority of blacks,'' he said, but ``black-on-black murder is the
leading cause of death in black males 15 to 44 and the leading
cause of death in black females 15 to 34.''
   But Bell said policymakers cannot be excused for demonstrating
``a selective inattention to black homicide'' because many whites
harbor the fear expressed by one of his colleagues: ``If black
people stop killing black people, they will start killing white
people.''
   Dr. Howard Spivak, deputy health commissioner of Massachusetts,
said the typical homicide occurs when two young men of the same
race who know each other have been drinking or using drugs and get
into an argument that escalates into a fatal act of violence.
   Punitive measures like those being touted nationally would have
no effect, said Spivak.
   But District of Columbia Superior Court Associate Judge Reginald
Walton, who has been nominated to be the No. 3 man in the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said many young men who end up before
him have no idea ``what the appropriate role of a male or father is
in this society.''
   Walton complained that policy makers have ignored earlier
recommendations for dealing with the effect of crime on children.
   He said no action was taken when a task force for Washington,
D.C., schools on which he served proposed improving school athletic
programs. Consequently, the judge said, he learned that drug
dealers are financing an underground basketball league used to
recruit young people.
   Bell and Spivak also criticized television for presenting
unrealistic heroes, male role models and situations that emphasize
violent solutions to problems.
   ``One young man being treated in an emergency room for a gunshot
wouund told me that he was surprised that the injury hurt; his
perception from television was that such injuries were neither
painful nor incapacitating,'' said Spivak.
   ``We've simply got to stop peddling violence to the children of
this country,'' added Gregory Loken, executive director of Covenant
House, a runaway youth program based in New York City.

   The White House came to a temporary halt
Tuesday for what President Bush described as a ``dog eat dog''
tennis match featuring pros Chris Evert and Pam Shriver against two
of Bush's sons.
   The two women were supposed to have played against Marvin and
Jeb Bush last year in Florida in a fund-raising game during Bush's
presidential race. However, the game was rained out.
   It was finally rescheduled for Tuesday on the White House courts
but was rained out there, as well. So they moved the game to an
indoor court usually reserved for senators on the fifth floor of
the Hart Senate Office Building.
   Watching from the sidelines were Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, CIA chief William Webster, Michael J. Boskin, chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers, a sprinkling of members of
Congress and other guests.
   ``This is just a happy family match, dog eat dog,'' Bush said.
   The press was excluded from most of the match but it was clear
during a brief photo-taking session that the teams were evenly
matched.
   On the return to the White House, reporters shouted to ask who
had won.
   Jeb Bush was about to answer, but Pam Shriver clamped her hand
over his mouth.
   It was learned from reliable sources that the men won, two out
of three sets.

   Muhammad Ali, diagnosed as having Parkinson's
syndrome, testified Tuesday for a Yugoslav-born doctor whose
treatment the former heavyweight boxing champion credits with
improving his life.
   Ali, 47, walked stiffly and could barely be heard giving
testimony at the trial of Dr. Rajko Medenica, a cancer specialist
charged with fraud by Swiss authorities. Medenica practices in
South Carolina.
   Former Gov. John West of South Carolina, who credits Medenica
with successfully treating his daughter-in-law's throat cancer, and
Richard Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, also
appeared Tuesday as character witnesses.
   Yolanda, Ali's third wife, often spoke for him during the
10-minute courtroom appearance.
   ``Muhammad had a low image of himself,'' said Mrs. Ali, 32.
``After this treatment he was full of life.''
   ``He improved my physical condition,'' Ali said, and credited
the doctor with stopping the trembling in his hands.
   At a news conference, Ali seemed alert and in good spirits,
joking with reporters despite partly slurred speech and a gaze that
sometimes was distant.
   Asked how he felt, he answered: ``Good. I never felt better.''
   ``I talk when I feel like it,'' he said, adding that his speech
has improved in the past few years. When a reporter reminded him of
being ``The Greatest,'' Ali responded: ``Used to be.''
   Parkinson's syndrome is a treatable form of the incurable,
debilitating Parkinson's disease.
   Mrs. Ali said Medenica, whom they first consulted a year ago,
found evidence of pesticide poisoning and devised a treatment that
includes the drug interferon, as does his cancer therapy, and a
regenerative process known as blood cleaning.
   Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and dedicated himself to
promoting Islam. He lives much of the time on a farm in Geneva.
   The trial, which began April 17, is being held without Medenica.
A U.S. district judge withdrew the doctor's passport on grounds his
American patients depend on his treatment.
   Medenica, 49, is accused of writing $2.6 million in fake bills
while treating patients, including many Yugoslavs, at a Geneva
hospital in 1973-81.
   A Yugoslav court, in the same case, sentenced Medenica to 20
years in prison in 1983 for defrauding the government social
security system.
   He was released from 15 months of Swiss investigative custody in
1984 when West got a Geneva judge to allow bond and helped raise
much of the required $300,000. Medenica set up practice in Hilton
Head, S.C., and became a U.S. citizen.

   More than 5,000 doctors at government
hospitals in New Delhi and four other cities went on strike Tuesday
after salary negotiations failed.
   Talks with a 17-member government team in the capital broke down
late Monday and ``there is a complete deadlock,'' said Dr. Anil
Gurtoo, who represented New Delhi's 3,500 junior doctors in the
negotiations.
   The striking doctors are junior hospital staff members, nearly
all of them residents. Senior doctors have handled emergency cases
since the strike began.
   Strikers want an increase of $53 in monthly pay that now ranges
from $200 to $270. They also seek an increase in the compensation
for not maintaining private practice from $16 to $40 and firm
schedules for promotion.
   Gurtoo told reporters medical care was crippled in New Delhi's
10 government hospitals. He said they treated only about 10,000
patients during the day, fewer than half the usual number.
   Strikes also were called by about 1,500 doctors at government
hospitals in Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Banaras and Aligarh, Gurtoo
said.

   A bomb attached to a telephone
pole exploded Tuesday as a joint army and police patrol was
passing, injuring six people, including a soldier and a police
officer, the city police said.
   None of the injured was hurt seriously, according to first
reports. Police blamed the bomb on the outlawed Irish Republican
Army.
   Police also said they arrested two men in the Protestant Crumlin
Road during a search that uncovered 500 rounds of ammunition and a
submachine gun.
   The police were believed to be searching for the Soviet-made
RPG-7 rocket launcher used Monday in a rocket and gunfire attack on
a Sinn Fein office center in the Ardoyne district.
   Four people in the office during the attack escaped injury,
though the office was hit by a rocket and several bullets, police
said.
   Sinn Fein is the legal political arm of the IRA, which is
fighting to end British rule in the mainly Protestant province and
unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic in the
south.
   The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary
group, claimed responsibility Tuesday night for the shooting death
of a Roman Catholic workman and the attack on the Sinn Fein office.
   It contended in messages to Belfast media that the slain
building worker was an IRA member and that the office was an IRA
meeting place.
   The workman was unloading a car at a job site in a Protestant
neighborhood Monday when shot by a man who fired about a dozen
rounds from a stolen van.
   It was the 25th death attributed to Protestant-Catholic violence
in Northern Ireland this year.

<HEAD>Expo Puts Spotlight on Efforts to Rebuild After Devastating Blaze</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eclectic colors and textures of this year's
annual art exposition mask a story of resolve by many artists and
dealers who were nearly wiped out by a devastating fire last month.
   Many raced to assemble displays for the 10th annual Chicago
International Art Exposition, one of the world's premier art fairs,
amid ``a new spirit to rebuild, to get on with our work,'' said
painter Steven Heyman. He was one of the lucky ones who did not
lose everything in the April 15 blaze.
   Brick rubble is all that remains of the six-story block-sized
building that housed nine galleries in the heart of the city's
River North art district. Most of Heyman's paintings were in his
studio; only five were in a gallery ravaged by the fire that
destroyed an estimated $10 million worth of artwork.
   Others who weren't as fortunate talked Tuesday about their
struggle to recoup.
   ``We lost over 9,000 pieces of art,'' said gallery owner William
van Straaten, whose establishment was destroyed with ``all our
historical records ... all our research data, customer account
files dating back 20 years.''
   In the weeks since the blaze, the cause of which remains
undetermined, van Straaten and three other dealers who lost
galleries in the fire managed to put together exhibits for the
exposition, which opened May 11 and closed Tuesday.
   The fair, this year involving displays by more 200 galleries
from 20 countries, is a showplace for contemporary art that
attracts dealers, collectors and art lovers from around the world.
   ``We had a few things that were framed before the fair ... a few
things suppliers air-freighted to us on an emergency basis,'' van
Straaten said. ``But (the exhibit) is just not what it was'' in
previous years.
   Still, such efforts did not go unnoticed.
   ``I think it's extraordinary how dealers involved were able to
jump back ... they have all my admiration,'' said Margaret Failoni,
owner of Galleria Il Ponte in Rome.
   Ms. Failoni, who had a booth at the expo, said word of the blaze
traveled quickly in the tightly knit world art community.
   ``This is just not your local store down the street ... it's a
tragedy'' felt by artists and dealers worldwide, she said.
   ``If anything good has come of this I think it's the incredible
solidarity among dealers and everybody'' touched by the loss, she
said. ``Obviously we're all trying to help in any way we can.''
   ``It's a very resilient community here in Chicago that we
have,'' said Heyman, 36, who had several works displayed at the
fair and is already working on paintings for another show.
   ``People are looking forward,'' he said. ``It's a devastating
blow but it's not a fatal blow.''

   A convicted drug trafficker faces life behind
bars after pleading guilty to a racketeering conspiracy that
included a threat against the life of former U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani, prosecutors said Tuesday.
   Salvatore Spatola, 40, also admitted his part in a bungled
attempt on the life of a defendant in the ``pizza connection'' drug
trial.
   Spatola, already serving a five-year federal narcotics sentence,
pleaded guilty to four felony counts late Monday before U.S.
District Judge Kevin T. Duffy.
   He pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, narcotics
conspiracy, heroin trafficking and threatening to murder a federal
law enforcement official _ Giuliani, who is now running for the
Republican mayoral nomination.
   Spatola admitted plotting to kill Pietro Alfano, a drug-trial
defendant who was paralyzed by gunfire on a Greenwich Village
street in February 1987.
   Alfano was one of 18 men convicted the following month of
participating in a Mafia-dominated, international drug trafficking
ring. The case was dubbed the ``pizza connection'' because the ring
allegedly used pizzerias as fronts for distributing an estimated
$1.6 billion in heroin over a decade.
   ``He (Spatola) admitted hiring the other participants'' in the
Alfano shooting, said Assistve unit. The Michigan
Democrat noted that former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci had
announced withdrawal of the wing before NATO offered to help.
   Woodworth warned against that step, saying, ``We will harm
ourselves seriously with the allies.''
   Earlier, Robert Hale of the Congressional Budget Office told the
panels that the United States could save anywhere from $800 million
to $1.4 billion if it moves some of the active forces into
reserves. Hale said that would create be a ``modest'' reduction in
capability.
   The three panels considering the issue were the Senate Armed
Services subcommittees on manpower and personnel; readiness,
sustainability and support; and conventional forces and alliance
defense.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shots were fired Tuesday at the
home of the president of the legislative assembly, wounding a
police agent, the official said.
   Ricardo Alvarenga, of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, said the attack came from four people traveling in a red
double-cabin pickup truck.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, the
third in the past month on officials or supporters of the alliance,
known as Arena. But Alvarenga said he blamed leftist guerrillas.
   ``We were having lunch when a heard the gunfire,'' he said. ``I
saw one of the agents was wounded and sent him immediately to the
military hospital.''
   He said he did not know the agent's condition but that he
appeared to be seriously wounded.
   Three national policemen are on duty 24 hours a day at
Alvarenga's home. He also has three bodybuards and two drivers.
Some of them chased the assailants, but could not catch them, he
said.
   Alvarenga has opposed evacuation of about 100 wounded rebel
fighters who are scheduled to leave the country in the next few
days to receive medical treatment.
   The evacuation is part of an agreement between the rebels and
the Christian Democratic government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte. About 350 rebels have left since 1984 under the program to
receive medical attention in Cuba, Sweden and East Germany.
   ``We can't stop the evacuation, but we could take legal action
against those who let them leave,'' Alvarenga said recently.
   Duarte said he wasn't intimidated by threats and that the
government was proceeding with the evacuations.
   ``I believe the Salvadoran people understand my position and
know that I am doing what is just, humane and legal,'' he said
during an impromptu news conference Tuesday.
   Duarte's term expires June 1, when he turns the government over
to President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of Arena.
   On April 14, a bomb destroyed more than half the home of
Francisco Merino, the vice president-elect, and one of his nieces
was injured.
   Five days later Roberto Garcia Alvarado, chief federal
prosecutor, was killed in a bombing. Although he is not a member of
Arena, government officials said he was a party supporter.
   Arena blamed both attacks on the guerrillas, fighting for nine
years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government. The guerrillas'
Farbundo Marti National Liberation Front denied responsibility.

   Three West German relief workers were
abducted Tuesday, and one was freed later by militiamen who
intercepted the kidnap car in the belief it contained escaping
thieves, police reported.
   A spokesman for the Islamic Grouping militia said Petra
Schnitzler, 26, was freed after two militia members heard her
banging on the inside of the trunk.
   She had been kidnapped along with Heinrich Struebig, 48, and a
colleague tentatively identified as Thomas when gunmen stopped
them, police said. It was the third time Ms. Schnitzler and
Struebig had been reported abducted since last year and the second
in 12 days.
   All three work for the private West German relief group
ASME-Humanitas.
   A police spokesman said the white Mercedes carrying Ms.
Schnitzler in the trunk was intercepted after it sped into an alley
on the northern edge of Sidon.
   ``The two gunmen shot in the air to stop the white Mercedes,''
the police spokesman said of the accidental rescue. ``The driver of
the Mercedes and another passenger abandoned their car and ran
away.''
   Ali Sheik Ammar, head of the Islamic Grouping in Sidon and south
Lebanon, said Ms. Schnitzler was in good condition. His group is
one of the rare Sunni Moslem factions allied with Iran, which is
predominantly Shiite.
   After she was freed, she was taken to the Palestinian refugee
camp at Mieh Mieh.
   Reporters were allowed to see her later but she shouted. ``Go
away! I don't want to see anyone! I'm tired!''
   There was no word on the whereabouts of the other two relief
workers.
   Police said they still were not sure exactly what had happened.
   ``God knows what's going on between the crazy militias and the
crazier Germans,'' the spokesman said. ``We're completely baffled.''
   He said eight gunmen in three Mercedes cars intercepted the
relief workers at 7:30 p.m. on their way from the Mieh Mieh refugee
camp to their base at Aaqbiyeh. The spokesmen said the relief
workers were in two cars.
   On May 4, police reported that Struebig, Ms. Schnitzler and
colleague Markus Quint, 21, were abducted by five gunmen on Sidon's
southern edge. Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler, who also disappeared
overnight last year, were freed 10 hours later and Quint was
released in 10 days.
   Besides the two West Germans, 15 foreigners are missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed held by Shiite abductors loyal to Iran.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force plane evacuated the
first group of U.S. military dependents Tuesday on the eve of a
general strike that the Panamanian government has called illegal.
   The opposition vowed to go ahead with the one-day strike, which
coincides with the opening Wednesday in Washington of a conference
of the Organization of American States on Panama's nullified
election.
   President Bush telephoned Guillermo Endara, the opposition's
presidential candidate in the May 7 election who was severely
beaten a week ago by street gangs from the pro-government ``Dignity
Battalions.''
   Endara was released from a hospital Tuesday. An aide said Bush
spoke with Endara for about seven minutes and told him U.S. actions
were aimed at Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the
nation's Defense Forces, and not the Panamanian people.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said in Washington that
Bush called Endara ``to express sympathy over the assault which Mr.
Endara and his fellow leaders of the democratic forces in Panama
suffered at the hands of the Noriega regime.''
   ``The president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the
hemisphere in the wake of Noriega's effort to steal the election by
force and fraud.''
   At the U.S. Howard Air Force Base, 238 Americans boarded a
chartered Air Force plane _ the first of hundreds of dependents to
be evacuated in the next few weeks.
   Air Force Maj. Joan Ferguson said the group had 164 military
dependents, 71 active-duty personnel and three dependents of an
armed forces civilian employee.
   She said some of the active-duty personnel had fewer than three
months left on their tours in Panama and were vacating base housing
to make room for those who had been living off the base. She said
others were going on home leave and were taking advantage of the
special flight.
   While some Americans were being evacuated, the Bush
administration was sending 1,900 military personnel into Panama to
reinforce the more than 10,000 troopers stationed here.
   The Noriega-controlled government said Wednesday's strike is
motivated by political goals, not economic issues, and is an
attempt to stain Panama's image at the OAS meeting.
   Both the government and opposition say they will have
representatives at the conference.
   Benjamin Colamarco, the head of the ``Dignity Battalions,'' said
the paramilitary groups had no plans for the general strike and
were poised only to repel a U.S. invasion. Members of the groups
have frequently attacked opposition rallies.
   Endara, after leaving the hospital, said Wednesday would be ``a
very important day'' and threats would not stop the opposition.
   Influential legislator Rigoberto Paredes said on state-owned
Radio Nacional the strike is ``intended to create disorder in the
streets to a degree that the United States can use it to justify
direct physical intervention in Panama.''
   He said Noriega's departure from power is not negotiable.
   The opposition has said any solution to the Panamanian crisis
must involve talks with the military leading to Noriega's dismissal
or resignation.
   The troop presence on the streets has been low since May 11,
with the government frequently broadcasting declarations that the
nation is calm.
   The opposition wants the OAS to impose sanctions that would
amount to a political and diplomatic quarantine of Panama if the
government refuses to respect the results of the May 7 presidential
elections.
   Opposition leaders says they won by a 3-1 margin. The government
contends its candidates were ahead 2-1 when it stopped the vote
count and nullified the elections.
   Washington is urging Latin American nations to remove their
ambassadors from Panama.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, recalled for consultations by
Bush, left for Washington Monday. Mexico and Venezuela also have
recalled their envoys.
   Endara, smiling but with a bandaged head, walked from the
hospital and was cheered by a small group of hospital workers and
other supporters.
   He repeated the opposition contention that their candidates won
and that nothing short of being sworn into office will satisfy them.
   Endara rejected the idea of a junta ruling after acting
President Manuel Solis Palma's term runs out Sept. 1.
   ``The Panamanian people expressed their will on May 7. We
consider it the will of God and will not compromise,'' he said.
   A communique from the Labor Ministry published in newspapers
Tuesday said, ``Businesses may not close their doors and their
first obligation is to give work to all of their workers.''
   It urged businesses to open and employees to report for work,
but did not say what would happen if they did not.
   The opposition is urging Panamanians to stay in their houses
Wednesday except for ``protests at noon by any imaginable means.''

<TEXT>
   Five days after U.S. military
dependents were ordered out of their homes and onto U.S. bases, the
Kirberg family has accepted the situation without entirely
understanding the need.
   ``I still don't have any fear about going into Panama City,''
said Judy Boyle, who moved in with Leo and Pat LeBlanc with her
husband, Emil Kirberg, and their son, Blake.
   The Kirbergs said they were safer inside Fort Clayton, but they
have no plans to make an early departure from Panama, as others
started doing Tuesday.
   The first group of Americans to be evacuated boarded an Air
Force chartered plane at the Howard Air Force Base for a flight
back to the United States. Air Force Maj. Joan Ferguson said that
in the group were 164 dependents of military personnel, 71
active-duty personnel and three dependents of an armed forces
civilian employee. She said the active-duty troopers were departing
because their scheduled tours in Panama were nearing an end or they
were going on home leave.
   The Kirbergs were living in Panama City when President Bush
ordered U.S. dependents into military bases following the beating
of opposition presidential candidates in the streets of Panama.
   They packed up a few suitcases and descended on the LeBlancs.
Leo LeBlanc is Kirberg's boss and designated sponsor.
   Now, five days later, the Kirbergs are resigned to living with
the LeBlancs. Under evacuation rules, they said, they have until
July 1 to find onbase housing or Blake and his mother will have to
leave.
   Kirberg's two-year tour as an Army contract employee ends in
July anyway.
   They are planning a trip to their 10th-floor apartment
overlooking the city and the bay to bring back ``anything that
could be stolen.'' That includes three TV sets and a VCR. They'll
also check on the dog, Sissy, boarding with a foster family.
   For them, it's the little things that are the biggest problems.
   Four-year-old Blake misses his dog, but has found a new playmate
in the LeBlancs' 9-week-old toy poodle, Prince.
   Emil Kirberg misses Sissy too. The 20-pound mutt used to pull
guard duty in Blake's bedroom, and now Blake insists on sleeping in
the Kirbergs' bed.
   ``He's like an octopus. He's got eight arms and he swims,'' said
Kirberg.
   Blake will be out of school as of Friday; the base is cutting
short the school year so those who want to leave soon can receive
credit and-or graduate.
   The LeBlancs, with two daughters in college in Texas, originally
took in a second family too, but that crowded the house.
   ``They're the kind that only need five hours of sleep while the
rest of us need eight,'' said Boyle, ``so they were lying in bed at
5 a.m. afraid they'd wake us up if they moved around.''
   That family moved out Sunday, returning to their house in Panama
City.
   ``His mother-in-law really wanted to go home and they didn't see
any security problem,'' said Kirberg. ``She was 78 and it was all
too much for her.''
   Indeed, the reasons for the evacuation escape even some
hard-bitten veterans.
   One retired master sergeant who still works at Fort Clayton said
he got together with some of his on-duty comrades Monday night to
``complain about the management.''
   ``This is not being handled well,'' he grumbled. ``There just
isn't any crisis.''
   Other drawbacks, ``aside from not sleeping in your own bed,'' as
Boyle said, are minor.
   Leo LeBlanc doesn't like Blake fooling with his stereo hookup.
There's only one shower. The LeBlancs won't accept money for food,
so the Kirbergs try to figure out the menu and buy for it.
   There are also some positive features. The LeBlanc house is only
two minutes from the Kirbergs' offices, instead of half an hour.
   And Pat LeBlanc is a great cook, which the Kirbergs admit has
not been a strong point for either of them.
   ``I want to stay forever,'' said Blake.
   ``Fine, we'll draw up the adoption papers,'' said Leo LeBlanc.
   But Pat LeBlanc shook her head.
   ``I haven't forgotten what it's like to have little kids,'' she
said.

   The rail line wrecked by a runaway
train that leveled homes, killing four people, reopened Tuesday
after Southern Pacific and the city reached an agreement heading
off a threatened court order.
   The first train down the Cajon Pass rolled past the site of the
accident at 4:05 p.m., and the second train followed 40 minutes
later, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera.
   City Attorney James Penman, with city council authorization to
seek an injunction keeping the track closed, insisted on an
agreement requiring that the railroad buy 11 properties damaged in
the accident Friday.
   Southern Pacific had agreed to buy seven $70,000 homes that were
demolished, and agreed Tuesday afternoon to buy the other four and
accepted the city's demand for an undeveloped land buffer in case
of another derailment.
   Southern Pacific also agreed to pay the costs of relocating
residents and housing them for 90 days, pick up the city's cleanup
costs and defend San Bernardino in any lawsuit resulting from the
wreck.
   Penman said the agreement prevented a potentially protracted
court fight. ``We know it is difficult to get an injunction against
a national transportation arm,'' he said.
   Eight trains that normally use the line daily had been rerouted
since Friday, when a train traveling 90 mph jumped the tracks on a
curve trains are supposed to take at 30 mph. Two boys in a home and
two crewmen were killed.
   Penman said the railroad complained that it is losing $1 million
a day while the track is closed.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was winding down
interviews Tuesday. In a Monday night briefing, officials said
trainman Larry Hill didn't tell the lead engineer about a set of
failed brakes on the train.
   Hill also told investigators that he failed to activate
emergency brakes for 13 miles after first noticing a loss of
pressure in brake lines, officials said.
   NTSB officials said there also was a chance the crew of the
69-car Southern Pacific freight train was unaware of how heavy
their freight was and miscalculated the braking needed down the
pass where the accident occurred.

   The Presidium retired the government television
chief Tuesday, three weeks after he apologized for the suggestion
on a live broadcast that Vladimir Lenin should be removed from
public view and buried.
   Alexander Aksyonov, head of the state committee for television
and radio, called Gostelradio, apologized at a Communist Party
plenum in April after the remark by Mark Zakharov, director of
Moscow's Leninsky Komsomol Theater.
   Zakharov said Lenin's body should be removed from its glass case
in a mausoleum on Red Square.
   Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union, is treated with
religious reverence.
   The official news agency Tass said Tuesday that Aksyonov was
relieved of his duties in connection with his retirement and
replaced by Mikhail Nenashev, head of the state book publishing
committee.
   Kremlin ideology chief Vadim Medvedev visited Gostelradio last
week and raised staff salaries. Journalists reportedly were pleased
with Medvedev's comments on their work, and the host of
``Vzglyad,'' where the controversial suggestion was made, continues
to appear on the air.

peace plan. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of eight African nations on
Tuesday signed an Angolan government peace plan aimed at ending the
country's 14-year civil war, the news agency Lusa reported.
   After a one-day summit in Luanda, Angola's capital, the leaders
supported the peace plan by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the
Portuguese agency said.
   Dos Santos did not disclose details of the plan other than to
say it includes a ``peace zone'' along the Benguela railroad, Lusa
reported.
   The railroad running through central Angola is an important
route to the Atlantic Ocean for landlocked Zaire, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, but rebel attacks have paralyzed much of the track.
   Dos Santos was joined in support for his plan by the presidents
of Congo, Gabon, Mozambique, Sao Tome e Principe, Zaire, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
   ``It's not about obtaining peace at any price,'' the Angolan
news agency ANGOP quoted dos Santos as saying earlier Tuesday,
``but to consider the means, and to create the conditions for
launching a just and lasting peace.''
   ANGOP said most of the African leaders support an ``African
solution'' proposed by the Angolan government that would allow
rebels to integrate into society through a government amnesty.
   Dos Santos has refused to negotiate with Jonas Savimbi's rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola and says any
solution must accept one-party rule by his Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, a Marxist party.
   The rebels have rejected the amnesty and demand negotiations
leading to power-sharing in the former Portuguese colony.
   Savimbi was excluded from U.S.-sponsored peace talks that led to
a December agreement by which South Africa pledged to halt aid to
the rebels and grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor,
Namibia.
   In exchange, 50,000 Cuban troops backing the Angolan government
in the war have begun leaving Angola.
   The Luanda summit follows a series of meetings between dos
Santos and other African leaders since last October, when the
Angolan president committed himself to look for a solution
``inspired by the experience of other African countries that have
lived through similar situations.''
   Earlier Tuesday, African leaders criticized U.S. support for the
right-wing Angolan rebels, who have waged a bush war since 1974.
   Dos Santos attacked what he called the United States' ``publicly
declared intention to continue to destabilize Angola,'' the ANGOP
news agency said in a report monitored in Lisbon.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda praised the Reagan and Bush
administrations for mediating in the Angolan dispute, but said the
U.S. supply of arms to the rebels contradicted this and was
``killing the Angolan people.''

<HEAD>Kemp Reinstates Funding for Rehabilitation Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Tuesday he would
restore funding beginning June 1 to a subsidized low-income housing
program he canceled last month.
   Testifying for the second day before the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies, Kemp also said the
Department of Housing and Urban Development would issue new
guidelines to ensure competitiveness and more equitable
distribution of funds in the scandal-plagued moderate
rehabilitation program.
   ``I've asked my general counsel to prepare for the Federal
Register by June 1 the notification of fund availability,'' said
Kemp. ``We want to make sure that the good guys ... are not
squeezed out of the system by political influence.''
   Kemp suspended the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program on
April 26 after an audit by the HUD inspector general revealed
several former HUD and other government officials were consultants
to public housing authorities obtaining grants to renovate and
repair subsidized housing for low-income families.
   The consultants charged the housing authority or developer
between $500 and $1,500 per unit, in many cases for doing little
more than placing phone calls or writing to former government
colleagues.
   The inspector general's audit also showed many states received
more than their alloted ``fair share'' of the grants while those
most in need were shortchanged.
   ``The integrity of the system is important for all of us,'' said
Kemp, promising the inspector general would maintain an ongoing
audit of the program.
   ``Those people who are going to participate in this program are
going to know up front from day one that it is going to be audited
very carefully.''
   Asked by subcommittee chairwoman Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
how he would also ensure ``the good guy communities'' which
followed previous HUD regulations weren't punished, Kemp said there
would be no prejudice against those communities and projects that
had been approved before the suspension.
   However he said it would not be possible to preserve the
program's competitiveness if their proposals were given any
advantage over new submissions.
   ``They won't lose their position,'' he said. ``It will be looked
at very carefully, They've already done much of the work that's
involved but ... it will just be a broader competitive process.''
   Mikulski also wanted some assurance that HUD was taking steps to
recover any actual losses discovered by the department's audit.
   The audit estimated that incorrect rent calculations in the 43
projects reviewed by the inspector general would result in
excessive housing assistance totaling $58 million during the
15-year contract period. Total excessive assistance for all
projects funded could approach $413 million, the report said.
   ``Where we find that the rent levels have been set to high
because of the inappropriate level of rehabilitation ... we will on
a case-by-case basis take steps to roll back the rents and that
will in turn save subsidy costs over the multiple year period,''
said Jim Schoenberger, HUD general deputy assistant secretary.

   Crystal Hall, who kept working as a
prostitute after learning she had AIDS until jail persuaded her to
straighten out her life, has died, Rhode Island Hospital announced
Tuesday.
   Hall, 25, died Monday evening after a 19-day stay, hospital
spokesman Rick Piester said Tuesday. He declined to give the cause
of death.
   Hall, a drug addict with a record of 34 prostitution arrests,
made headlines when District Court Judge Albert E. DeRobbio
threatened to charge her with attempted murder if she continued to
work the streets.
   DeRobbio later sentenced Hall to 13 months in jail. He said that
for her customers, having sex amounted to a death sentence.
   Behind bars, Hall got off heroin, came close to earning a high
school diploma and responded well to treatment for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. She began talking about trying to steer
youngsters away from drugs and crime after her release.
   In February, DeRobbio and public defender Lauren Wilkins agreed
on a plan for Hall to spread her reform message. On her release,
she began working for Channel One, a Warwick drug program that
planned a documentary on her life.
   Hall was charged with violating the terms of her probation after
she was arrested behind the wheel of a stolen car.
   The charge was dropped shortly before she entered the hospital
for the last time, said state Corrections Department spokesman
Joseph A. DiNitto.
   AIDS, or human immunodeficiency virus, damages the body's immune
system, leaving it susceptible to infections and cancer. AIDS is
spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.

   A 10-inch baby believed to among the
smallest ever born was making good progress Wednesday, a hospital
spokesperson said.
   Two-week-old Nicole Shiralee Faunce, who weighs only 14.7
ounces, was delivered 11 weeks prematurely by Caesarean section
after she stopped growing in the womb.
   Nicole is being kept alive in a ventilator and has put on 1.4
ounces since being born.
   ``She is making good progress,'' said Royal North Shore Hospital
spokeswoman Samantha Jones.
   Dr. Garth Leslie was optimistic Nicole would survive.
   ``She is a fighter and has a better than 50 percent chance of
living,'' he said.
   Nicole's parents, Ray and Jenny Faunce, live 90 minutes by car
north of Sydney but visit the child every other day.
   ``We'd like to come down ever day but just can't afford it,''
said Ray Faunce, who works as a firefighter.
   According to the Guinness Book of Records, the lowest birth rate
recorded for a surviving baby was 10 ounces. It says Marian Chapman
was 12.4 inches long when born prematurely at South Shields,
England, in 1938. She died in 1983.

   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang promised
hunger-striking students early Wednesday the government will take
concrete steps toward democracy, demanded by the 300,000 people
jamming Tiananmen Square.
   But student leaders said they rejected Zhao's offer and would
press on with their protests for democracy.
   As Chinese leaders held a historic summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday,
protesters surged onto its steps. The crowd, including students on
a 4-day-old hunger strike, turned the adjoining 100-acre square
into a vast parade ground.
   Hundreds of police and soldiers guarded the hall entrances, but
no police were seen in the square.
   The month-old student campaign for democracy became a mass
movement as teachers, doctors, reporters, government employees,
workers and others who had cheered from the sidelines took up
banners and marched.
   Not since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when youths mobilized
by Mao Tse-tung ousted alleged rightists, has there been such a
mass challenge to the Communist establishment. This time, however,
it is coming from outside the party.
   ``We cannot fail to come out at such a critical moment,'' said a
Qinghua University teacher.
   After midnight, Zhao sent a message to the students from the
party leadership saying it affirmed their patriotic spirit in
calling for greater democracy and attacking official corruption.
   He also said the government would not punish them and would
``work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law, oppose
corruption, build an honest and clean government and expand
openness.''
   The message, reported by the official news agency Xinhua,
addressed key demands of the students, but he did not accede to a
demand for talks with officials to be broadcast live.
   Zhao promised only that leaders would talk ``with students and
other people at various levels through multiple channels after the
students return to campuses.''
   Student leaders received the document from party officials
during the night and rejected it after a meeting, said Cheng Zhen
of Beijing Normal University.
   She said it did not adequately address the question of a
dialogue with the students and did not thoroughly reject the
government's previous stance that students want to put the country
in turmoil.
   Students planned another mass march on Wednesday afternoon.
   Hundreds conducted an overnight sit-in outside Communist Party
headquarters, led in occasional chants of ``Li Peng, come out!'' by
a Buddhist monk in a saffron robe waving a small bell.
   Many Chinese speculated the protest would force the complete
retirement of 84-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who in 1987
stepped down from all posts except head of the Central Military
Commission.
   ``If (the leaders) fear the people, they can't represent them,''
said Song Lou, a teacher at the Workers' Movement Institute.
   In a meeting with Gorbachev, however, Zhao said: ``We still need
his wisdom and experience.''
   A doctor at the Beijing Emergency Center said early Wednesday
about 600 of the more than 3,000 hunger strikers had been
hospitalized since the strike began Saturday but some later
returned to the square. He said some cases were serious, including
one student he treated for heart failure.
   Twelve students also stopped taking liquids Tuesday.
   Classmates laid them on blankets just off the square, already
closed to traffic by the crowd.
   ``We cannot die today,'' proclaimed a banner held over their
heads.
   In the coastal city of Shanghai, more than 4,000 students held a
sit-in at city headquarters to show support for the Beijing hunger
strikers, Xinhua reported.
   Xinhua and the TV news also carried unusually complete reports
of the Beijing protest, including the support shown by the public.
   A high party official, Yan Mingfu, visited the strikers and said
over a student-controlled loudspeaker he sympathized with them, but
urged them to go home and give the government more time. Several
student leaders agreed.
   ``Yan is somebody we can trust,'' said Wu'er Kaixi of the United
Association of Beijing Universities, an independent student group
formed to lead the movement. The hunger strikers voted to stay,
with only 56 dissenting.
   The presidents of Beijing colleges issued a letter read over the
public address system that urged the students to end the protest
but also asked the government to meet the demands.
   Students say they will not leave the square until the government
apologizes for an April 26 editorial in the People's Daily that
accused them of plotting against the state.
   They had expected the government to capitulate quickly, but then
prepared for a long protest.
   With public donations, they bought umbrellas and hats to shelter
protesters. They organized trucks to bring water and take away
garbage, and kept paths clear for the trucks and ambulances.
   Hunger strikers sprawled listlessly on blankets surrounded by a
wall of fellow students holding hands.
   Hundreds of thousands of non-students roamed the square and
nearby avenues. Marchers included people from official media,
out-of-town schools and hospitals, the state-run airline and labor
federation. Artists, movie makers and hastily formed organizations
calling themselves the ``Beijing Citizens Support Group'' and
``Unemployed Youth Support Group'' joined the demonstration.
   The Peking Union Medical College set up a tent and administered
salt and sugar water intravenously to more than 100 students.
   Dr. Ma Sui said most fasters could continue three or four more
days, ``but after that I fear they will be in danger of their
lives.''

   U.S. officials said they were displeased with
the wording of preliminary draft resolutions intended for
Wednesday's emergency session of the Organization of American
States to discuss the Panama crisis.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Tuesday one
of their main objections to the draft resolutions by Venezuela and
Peru was that neither mentioned Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega by name.
   The United States is expected to push hard for a resolution
demanding that Noriega, Panama's military leader and de facto ruler
of the country, step down.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the May 7 electoral returns in Panama while asserting that the
solution to Panama's crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A U.S. official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the OAS secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in Panama.
   Among the 31 OAS members, the United States is aligned with a
cluster of democratic countries in Central and South America while
Mexico and Brazil are proponents of a less activist policy, citing
OAS provisions guaranteeing respect for the principle of
non-intervention.
   The meeting is being convened at the request of Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez, who reportedly favors a resolution
calling on Noriega to step down.
   The Bush administration position favors the recognition of the
opposition candidate in the May 7 election, Guillermo Endara, as
the legitimate authority in Panama. Four days after the election,
the State Department began referring to Endara as Panama's
``president-elect.''
   The House voted 413-0 on Tuesday to approve a resolution
condemning Noriega's ``reprehensible actions'' in thwarting the
election, and calling on him and the Panamanian military to
recognize Endara as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized Guillermo Endara as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution which
was sent to the Senate.
   It also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy steps'' taken
by President Bush ``as an appropriate and measured response to the
crisis in Panama.''
   ``We have a better indication of positive results than we have
come to expect in the past,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said of the reaction by Latin countries to the
administration's call for solidarity against Noriega.
   There is hope that the OAS will take a strong position, he said.
``On the other hand, we don't have any specific indication of what
the OAS might do,'' he said.
   He said he was unaware of an effort reported from diplomatic
sources in Panama that the United States is engaged in a petition
effort to get other countries to recall their ambassadors from
Panama as the United States has done.
   As to whether the administration wants Noriega to accept an
offer of refuge in Venezuela, Fitzwater said, the president's
feeling is that, ``he ought to take any offer he could get.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in Panama.
   Indicating that the United States plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, Boucher said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interests
in democracy.''
   Meanwhile, Panamanian diplomats are expected to try to convince
their hemispheric colleagues that Panama's problems are the product
of a systematic campaign of U.S. interventionism, including a
series of economic sanctions and a widely reported $10 million U.S.
government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the OAS charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   With a large majority of hemispheric countries headed by elected
governments, some delegates are expected to push hard for an
anti-Noriega resolution because to do otherwise might encourage
restive military officers to displace civilian presidents.
   But others are likely to be reluctant to push Noriega too hard,
particularly concerning allegations that he attempted to rig the
elections. These delegates may be wary about setting a precedent in
the event that the election processes in their own countries face
similar criticism.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, seemed guardedly
optimistic on Tuesday that a consensus existed for an anti-Noriega
resolution.
   ``The OAS is on the ropes,'' one official said, noting that the
organization is plagued by declining prestige and onrous financial
problems. About 300 OAS employees were laid off earlier this year.
   The official said it would make no sense for the OAS to ``create
a cloud of dust'' by convening a foreign ministers meeting and then
do nothing.
   A large turnout of foreign ministers will be on hand for the
special session, the first of its kind for the OAS since 1982 when
Britain and Argentina went to war over their conflicting claims to
the Falkland-Malvinas Islands.
   Among the handful of foreign ministers not expected to attend
are the ones from Brazil and Chile. They will be represented by
subordinates.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Bush called
presidential Endara on Tuesday ``to express sympathy over the
assault which Mr. Endara and his fellow leaders of the democratic
forces in Panamna suffered at the hands of the Noriega regime.''
   ``The president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the
hemisphere in the wake of Noriega's effort to steal the election by
force and fraud,'' he said.
   Popadiuk said he had no further information on the call.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,
suffering from recurrent pneumonia, lapsed into critical condition
Tuesday, a hospital official said.
   ``It's an episodic thing, he has pneumoia and his condition has
been downgraded,'' said Eugene Tiwanak, assistant administrator of
St. Francis Hospital. ``It's impossible to say more than that.''
   Marcos was returned to the intensive care unit Monday after a
month in the telemetry unit, according to a hospital statement.
   A nursing supervisor refused to elaborate on the statement,
which said Marcos was relying on a respirator to help him breathe.
   The 71-year-old Marcos has been hospitalized since January for
treatment of heart and respiratory ailments.
   On April 12, Marcos was transferred from the intensive care unit
to one that cares for heart patients. Doctors said then that he was
``chronically ill'' and unlikely to recover.
   Marcos aides said last week that the ousted leader appeared to
be improving and had requested that a reclining chair be brought to
his hospital room from his Makiki Heights home.
   Hospital officials on Tuesday refused to detail the downturn in
Marcos' health, but Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Marcos
suffered a sudden drop in blood pressure.
   ``I really don't know much more than that,'' he said. ``His
blood pressure dropped and they thought he should be back in ICU.''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under U.S. indictment on
charges they plundered the Philippine government of more than $100
million and stashed much of the money in the United States in the
form of art and real estate.
   A judge ruled Marcos will not have to stand trial unless he
recovers.
   The Marcoses have lived here in exile since February 1986, when
they were ousted in a popular revolt that lifted Corazon Aquino to
power.

<HEAD>London-Trained Guardian Angels Begin Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British-trained Guardian Angels began their first
subway anticrime patrols Tuesday and immediately ran into trouble;
so many reporters and photographers followed them around that
underground traffic jams developed. London transport police
intervened, telling the mob of journalists pursuing the Angels
through subway cars to split up to stop the overcrowding.
   ``We had received a number of complaints, not about the Guardian
Angels but about the pressmen accompanying them who were causing an
obstruction,'' said a transport police spokesman, who refused to be
identified.
   ``They were asked to leave and split into smaller groups.''
   Thirty Angels completed three months of training Sunday and 11
began work Tuesday, led by American Curtis Sliwa, who founded the
group in New York and helped spread chapters throughout the United
States.
   ``Be courteous, vigilant and alert,'' Sliwa told his recruits,
who have been criticized by police as ``vigilantes.''
   ``The police have been negative. The public will ask many
questions. Let them know you are the newly qualified London
Guardian Angels.
   ``So far they have been used to Brooklyn and Bronx accents,''
Sliwa said, referring to initial patrols made by Sliwa and other
New York-based Angels.
   Most subway passengers paid no attention to the Angels in their
signature red berets and T-shirts, but one woman walked up to shake
Sliwa's hand.
   ``I am delighted to see you,'' said Marrion Caullen, 64. ``Your
presence is very reassuring to pensioners (senior citizens) like
myself.''
   Meanwhile, the Police Federation chairman, Alan Eastwood, told
his group's annual conference in Blackpool that groups like the
Angels tended to work according to their own laws.
   ``If you dress people in T-shirts and berets, and invest them
with spurious powers, they start to run the neighborhood the way
they want it but not necessarily the way the law says it should be
done,'' Eastwood said.
   He said police were studying bringing back a World War II-era
association of retired police officers called ``Dad's Army,'' which
fought street crime. It was disbanded in the late 1950s.
   ``We are looking at it as a possible means of resisting the
growth of uncontrolled and unaccountable private security while at
the same time giving chief officers greater flexibility in dealing
with manpower problems,'' he said.

   All it took was a little coaching from a 911
operator for a quick-thinking and ``amazingly calm'' 7-year-old
girl to help her mother give birth Tuesday.
   Teri Lawrence and her baby, William Zachery, were ``doing very
well'' Tuesday night at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, said
spokeswoman Carol King.
   Mrs. Lawrence said she woke at 7 a.m. Tuesday to realize that
her baby was on its way, Ms. King said. But her husband, Edwin,
already had left for work and Mrs. Lawrence couldn't get to the
telephone to call an ambulance.
   That's when her daughter Amanda, 7, dialed the operator for
help, Ms. King said. The operator got the call at 7:32 a.m. and
patched the call through to 911 operators in Cobb County.
   The Lawrences live in the northwestern Atlanta suburb of
Acworth, in Bartow County, and the 911 operators told Amanda how to
help her mother.
   ``I think I did a great job, and it was a good idea I helped
little Zachery be born,'' Amanda said in a telephone interview from
the hospital Tuesday night. ``I was shocked, but I knew what was
going on, even though he came out a little purplish, purple-blue. I
even got to hold him.''
   Mrs. Lawrence could not be interviewed late Tuesday because she
was asleep.
   ``The mother was doing OK as far as the labor was concerned, but
Amanda was providing help the mother couldn't give herself,'' Ms.
King said. ``She had to give directions to the house, which was on
streets that aren't marked, and get towels for her mom and unlocked
the doors for the ambulance.''
   ``We just kept her on the line to monitor the situation while we
called Bartow to dispatch emergency vehicles,'' said Cobb County
police supervisor Julia Kilgore.
   Rescue workers arrived at the Acworth home at 7:50 a.m., and the
Lawrences were on their way to the hospital at 8:09 a.m., officials
said.
   Mrs. Lawrence and her baby are expected to go home Wednesday,
she said. Through it all, Amanda remained ``amazingly calm,'' Ms.
King said.
   ``Her mom says Amanda really hasn't grasped how important a role
she played,'' Ms. King said. ``Amanda says she just talked on the
phone.''
   Ms. King said Amanda had attended a childbirthing course several
weeks earlier, when the Lawrences couldn't find a baby sitter for
Amanda, so they brought her, too.
   ``She had seen the film and heard the discussion, so she was
aware of some of what was happening,'' Ms. King said.
   ``I'm just so proud of her,'' Edwin Lawrence said of his
daughter. ``If she hadn't been there ... she was just about to
leave for school when my wife had a severe contraction. Amanda was
fine about it until her mother started carrying on a little from
the pain, but the operator kept her calm.''

   Thunderstorms slapped north Texas with tornadoes, drenching rain
and hailstones as big as baseballs Tuesday, causing floods that
forced the evacuation of about 150 homes and a city zoo.
   The storms swept through Oklahoma and Louisiana as well, but
with lesser effect.
   In the East, heavy rains dropped up to three-fourths of an inch
of rain per hour on northern New Jersey, triggering flash flood
watches for New York City and Philadelphia.
   Sunny skies prevailed from Florida to the southern Appalachians,
the Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes region, and in the
Southwest. The Pacific Northwest had partly cloudy skies.
   The Southwest storms spun off tornadoes that touched down
northwest of Abilene, Texas and near McAlister, N.M., and Menard,
Texas. A twister occurred near Longview, Texas. No major injuries
or damage were reported.
   More than 11 inches of rain fell in Antelope, Texas, northwest
of Fort Worth, and more than 5 inches fell along the Red River
dividing the Lone Star State from Oklahoma, flooding roads and
homes in some places. Winds hit up to 100 mph.
   Gainesville, a city of about 14,000 people about 60 miles
northwest of Dallas, was among the hardest hit by the storm.
   National Guardsmen from the city helped evacuate about 150 homes
in low-lying areas threatened by floods, said state Trooper M.
Dial. Most of the evacuees were taken out by boat. Emergency
shelters were set up at two churches.
   Flooding forced the evacuation of the city's Frank Buck Zoo, but
18 deer were missing, said Milburn Cravens, Gainesville's director
of community services.
   Ninety-five percent of the animals, including zebras and
ostriches, were taken to a cattle auction barn. Cravens said he
hoped the deer would return to the zoo on their own.
   Dial earlier said some animals were lost, but officials said
there were no known animal deaths or injuries.
   Storm-sparked fires destroyed two mobile homes, the trooper said.
   Flooding blocked Interstate 35 south of Gainesville and U.S. 82
inside the city for a short time. High water also blocked roads in
Baylor, Jack and Archer counties west of Gainesville.
   In Callisburg, about 10 miles northeast of Gainesville, winds
flipped a mobile home, slightly injuring two women, the Cooke
County Sheriff's Department said.
   West of Gainesville, hail as big as baseballs fell. Hail up to
golf ball-size fell near the town of Robert Lee in southwest Texas
and near Gruver, Okla., in the Oklahoma Panhandle.
   In Fannin County, Texas, about 50 miles northeast of Dallas,
hail caused several thousand dollars in damages, officials said.
   ``Just about every house in Bonham that had windows on the west
side had the panes shattered by the hail,'' said county Civil
Defense Director David Norris. The hail smashed skylights, car
windows and windshields.
   At the Sam Rayburn Veterans Administration Center in the town of
about 7,200 people, patients were temporarily moved between floors
so workers could mop up rainwater that leaked through the
storm-damaged roof.
   Northwest Louisiana also had heavy rain. Zwolla had more than 6
inches of rain and Stanley had more than 5.
   Flash flood watches were in effect in northwest Louisiana,
northeast and north central Texas and southwest Oklahoma.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 95 at Avon Park,
Fla. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 25 degrees in Truckee,
Calif.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Mississippi River west across the Great
Plains, the central and southern Rockies and Arizona, with severe
thunderstorms possible in southern Kansas, Oklahoma and northern
Texas; widely scattered thunderstorms in southeast Florida; and
rain showers along the East Coast from Maine to New Jersey, and in
along the coasts of Washington and northern Oregon.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s and 80s across most
of the nation; in the 60s from sections of the Rockies to the
Pacific Northwest and along the north Atlantic Coast; in the 90s in
Florida, along Texas' Rio Grande Valley, in the desert Southwest
and in inland California valleys.

   The Bush administration is mixing praise for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to revamp Soviet economics and
politics with skepticism about the Soviet leader's proposals to
reduce nuclear weapons in Europe.
   ``What is going on in the Soviet Union is truly revolutionary
when you consider the economic and political system they have had
for the last 70 years,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday.
   Just back from Moscow and a 3{-hour meeting with Gorbachev, the
U.S. official said he favored normal trade with the Soviet Union,
which is now restricted by the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, and
gave a positive appraisal of perestroika, the economic
restructuring Gorbachev outlined at length in their meeting.
   ``It's light years away from where they were a few years ago,''
Baker said. ``It's important to recognize that what is going on is
real.''

   Smoking and drinking do not affect worker
absenteeism rates but physical fitness does, with out-of-shape
workers likely to miss more days of work, according to a study
released today.
   ``More physically fit individuals experience fewer work
absenteeism, and employer initiatives that increase the level of
physical activity among the work force may indeed have a positive
affect on employee absenteeism,'' said the report from the National
Chamber Foundation.
   While the foundation, the research arm of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, found attendance differences based on individual
characteristics such as income, education and physical condition,
it said group absenteeism projections based solely on race or
gender are groundless as well as discriminatory.
   ``The variance of absenteeism patterns among individuals is so
great as to make characterizations based on group behavior of no
value to the employer,'' the study said.

   Rising mortgage rates hit home sales and
prices hard in expensive Northeast cities in the first three months
of 1989, but booming West Coast markets weathered the storm, a real
estate trade group said today.
   Elsewhere, industrial cities in the Midwest with low-cost
housing showed healthy appreciation while depressed housing prices
in Texas' two largest cities began to recover, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
   The median price of an existing home in the San Francisco area
soared to $243,900 in the first quarter, meaning half sold for more
and half sold for less. That represented a 31.8 percent increase
from a year ago and was the steepest appreciation rate among 83
metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group.
   In fact, California accounted for the top five appreciation
rates in the nation. Home prices in Orange County, which includes
Anaheim and Santa Ana, shot up 30.2 percent to a median of
$237,900. In Los Angeles, prices rose 26.3 percent to $201,000; San
Diego, 21.9 percent to $163,900; and Riverside-San Bernardino, 21.6
percent to $116,000.

   Seven otters pulled from oil-polluted
Prince William Sound nearly two months ago have become the first to
be returned to the waterway and are tagged with radar clips for
monitoring.
   The otter release came as commercial fishermen opened the
halibut season Monday and a day before today's start of hearings
into the nation's worst oil spill.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 on a charted reef
25 miles south of Valdez. It leaked nearly 11 million gallons of
oil, polluting hundreds of miles of shoreline and killing countless
birds, fish and marine mammals.
   The four male and three female otters were freed Monday into
Simpson Bay, about 25 miles northwest of Cordova.

   The U.S. Treasury is losing billions of
dollars because employers _ including the government itself _ fail
to withhold taxes from the paychecks of workers who are erroneously
designated as ``independent contractors,'' the General Accounting
Office said today.
   GAO placed a good share of the blame on Congress, which, in an
effort 10 years ago to curtail the Internal Revenue Service, made
it more difficult to crack down on employers who violate the
withholding provisions.
   Paul L. Posner, a GAO associate director, said in testimony
prepared for a House Government Operations subcommittee that the
failure of workers designated as independent contractors to report
some or all their income is at the root of the revenue loss.
   In turn, GAO found, employers are not complying with
requirements that they file reports with the IRS on payments made
to individual contractors. Even when auditing business tax returns,
the report said, the IRS is not identifying businesses that fail to
file such reports.

   Excessive drinking, gridlock and
trashed hotels are causing some residents to question whether the
welcome mat to this spring break mecca should be rolled up.
   When Fort Lauderdale more or less told students to go elsewhere
for their weeks of unbridled partying, Daytona Beach took over as
the nation's top spring break destination.
   It attracted 500,000 students during the four weeks that ended
in early April, according to Georgia Carter, of the tourism
promotion agency Destination Daytona.
   Although students spent $100 million here, they left behind
angry residents who complained about car stereos blaring throughout
the nights on clogged streets, and youths urinating on lawns and
passing out in driveways.

<DATELINE>SUWALKI, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the lazy afternoon sun the people of
this vacation area close by the Soviet border gathered around a
park bandshell where a union troubadour strummed a guitar.
   Men in white golfing hats emblazoned with the red Solidarity
logo handed out paper flags to children, while at folding tables
volunteers sold campaign ``bricks,'' coupons printed to look like
bricks to build a campaign fund.
   In a scene similar to the Fourth of July in small-town America,
Solidarity was going to the people in Poland's experiment with a
new political style _ democracy.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek and filmmaker Andrzej Wajda were
kicking off their campaigns for the National Assembly in Warsaw on
the ticket of the Solidarity Citizens Committee.
   A deal between the Solidarity-led opposition and communist
authorities lets the opposition seek 161 seats in the existing
460-seat Sejm and creates a 100-member Senate, the East bloc's
first fully democratic legislative chamber.
   Solidarity has 261 candidates campaigning in all of the
country's 49 provinces.
   Their bustling election offices are provided by authorities and
staffed by volunteers, while leaflets, placards and flags are paid
for from small campaign donations collected at tables set up by the
local citizens committees. Officials say the money comes in too
quickly to count.
   Some communist candidates also have been out meeting voters, but
in general they've been slower to take up the Western-style
campaigning.
   Despite occasional murmurs about carpetbaggers from Warsaw _
Wajda last lived in Suwalki when he was 7 years old and Geremek
never lived here _ this town of 59,000 people was puffed up to have
two such renowned candidates and gave them a warm reception. Even
the communist mayor received them.
   Wajda is Poland's best-known filmmaker. Geremek, one of Lech
Walesa's closest advisers, is an architect of the ``round-table''
talks that ended April 5, making Solidarity legal again and opening
the way to the June 4 vote.
   Joining them were the local members of the Solidarity slate:
Jerzy Pietkiewicz, a 41-year-old teacher from nearby Elk and
Stanislaw Bernatowicz, an elderly scientist active in protecting
the region's lakes and forests.
   Wajda and Bernatowicz, running for Senate, and Geremek and
Pietkiewicz, for the Sejm, sounded similar themes at the park rally
with about 1,000 townspeople: Poland needs independence, the system
has failed and voters should use the elections to end the power
monopoly held by the Communist Party, officially the Polish United
Workers Party.
   At first slow and nervous, the intense Pietkiewicz soon was
being interrupted by cheers.
   ``Do we really live in a Polish state,'' he asked, ``if those
who have ruled have had to go to Red Square for instructions?''
   He said Poland was victimized by a Marxist-Leninist philosophy
that wrongly thought it could create ``paradise of earth'' through
``materialistic values'' that ignored religion and truth.
   Said Geremek: ``It cannot be any longer as it is now. ...
Everyday suffering, lines, lack of money or lack of goods, hard
life for women, lack of hope and lack of prospects for youth. ...
It has to be changed.''
   Candidates stressed the elections are a step to totally free
voting in four years. Authorities promised as much at the round
table, but the opposition is skeptical. Making Solidarity a
parliament force is seen as a way to hold the communists to their
word. Or as one pamphlet put it: ``Each vote for our candidates is
a step toward freedom.''
   Earlier, Geremek visited a hospital and Wajda a technical school
where bulletin boards were covered with posters showing scenes from
his films.
   He shared early memories of Suwalki with about 500 students of
voting age (18) and discussed his plans for a documentary about the
World War II massacre of Polish officers, including his father, at
Katyn in the Soviet Union. The government has been edging toward
acknowledging Soviet guilt for the massacre.
   In a province where a committee actively seeks the fate of some
200 residents rounded up by the Soviet secret police in 1945 and
believed executed, the allusion to Katyn was vivid.
   ``I'd vote for him,'' 19-year-old Bartosz Iwanowski said.
   ``Support for Wajda and Geremek is quite big. When people see
these names they immediately just sign underneath. ... Even party
members sign our list for Wajda,'' said Grzegorz Wilczynski,
helping to manage the Solidarity Citizens Committee office, three
small rooms in city hall.
   ``The church's support has been a big help,'' he added. ``It's
not done so openly, ... just on the part of individual priests. But
the people know.''
   He said people are elated to have a chance to make a real choice.
   ``If it turns out that we lose, I suspect many people will just
go into exile. ... We're laying out all our cards in this game.''
   But for one woman in the park, on a monthly pension of 23,000
zlotys _ $33 at the official rate _ the time for optimism has
passed.
   ``I don't support either the party or Solidarity. How can I make
a choice having only 23,000?'' she said bitterly as people gave
1,000-zloty donations a few steps away. ``Hope is the mother of
fools. I have no more.''

   The telephone company is dividing up London.
   The city is running out of telephone numbers, so starting next
May 1 it will be split in two, with separate area codes for the
central and outlying areas.
   It will be like what the telephone company in New York City did
when it separated the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten
Island from Manhattan and the Bronx.
   In Britain, the split offers fresh potential for social
one-upmanship.
   Out will go the old 01 area code for London, to be replaced by
071 for subscribers within roughly 4 miles of Charing Cross,
London's official center point, and 081 for the rest.
   It will also spell the end of London's pre-eminence in Britain's
telephonic pecking order. Stripped of its unique two-digit prefix,
the capital will have to get in line behind Birmingham (021),
Edinburgh (031), Glasgow (041), Liverpool (051) and Manchester
(061).
   Some Londoners may find it irksome to have to dial 10 digits to
cross the divide, and snobs will probably have a field day.
   ``071 will be a superior number to have,'' declares Elsie Burch
Donald, author of ``Debrett's Etiquette and Modern Manners.''
   ``Clearly there is an advantage socially, culturally,
economically to be living in central London.''
   Like New York, where Manhattan and the Bronx kept the original
212 area code and the other boroughs got 718, London is running out
of telephone numbers, especially since the rise of the fax system,
which sends documents over telephone lines.
   The new codes will double London's telephone capacity to 10
million. Without the change, it would have run out of numbers next
year, swamped by a 25-percent upsurge in demand in the last four
years, much of it in the center.
   British Telecom, the national telecommunications giant, has
given the public a full year to adapt, and is spending tens of
millions of dollars on the switchover, including $1.65 million just
to publicize it.
   But it isn't offering financial compensation for letterheads,
signs and addresses on delivery trucks that will have to be changed.
   Sign writers, copywriters, printers, decorators, telephone
engineers look to be in for a busy year. Telephone-triggered
burglar alarms will have to be adjusted too.
   Some subscribers have suggested running the split along the
Thames River, which divides the city into north and south.
   But British Telecom opted for rings, partly because ``people's
geography gets pretty hazy outside central London,'' said spokesman
Andrew Emerson.
   For the confused, British Telecom will provide a free recorded
message to set them straight.
   The 071 code will be stretched to include the Docklands, some 6
miles from the center of London, which is being transformed from a
wasteland of empty wharves and rusting warehouses into a bustling
telecommunications center.
   The new codes will carve through communities like Hammersmith in
west London, where some residents may have to dial 10 digits to
phone a neighbor across the street.
   Phone numbers used to be instant status symbols, when the first
three digits were represented by letters.
   Reporting the latest change, the conservative Daily Telegraph
wrote: ``Telephone subscribers in London who mourned the loss of
such emotive and colorful exchange names as the poetic BYRon and
MACaulay and the stately NOBle, FRObisher, EMPress and GULliver may
be further alarmed to hear that British Telecom is hoping to scrap
the 01 dialing prefix for London.''
   The letters system was scrapped 22 years ago, but numerical
prefixes remain a status symbol.
   ``Even now a number tells a tale,'' says Catherine Alabaster, an
estate agent in upmarket Knightsbridge. ``235 is Belgravia, 730 is
Sloane. A lot of people don't know it but there are smart numbers.
There are always these nuances. ... ''
   She says the latest change will make little difference to her
wealthy clientele, who ``will only know London as 071. They won't
look at the other zone _ it will almost be as if it doesn't exist.
They're not interested in fringes. In fact, they won't cross the
river.''

<TEXT>
   Three years ago, Werner and
Ingeborg Kuenz renounced their West German citizenship, packed
their belongings into the family Mercedes and headed for a new life
in East Germany.
   The decision stunned friends and relatives who could not
comprehend why they would both give up well-paying jobs and a
comfortable home to move to one of the most rigidly controlled
societies in Eastern Europe.
   ``Our relatives told us we were crazy,'' Werner Kuenz said.
   ``Nobody could believe that anyone would voluntarily go to a
country that thousands of people are trying desperately to get out
of.''
   Kuenz, who is 50 years old, said he and his wife decided to move
because they had inherited property from his wife's aunt, who lived
just outside Oranienburg, about 30 miles northwest of Berlin.
   The two-story, stucco house the couple inherited contained a
modest restaurant, bar and dance hall. The couple have been
operating The Anchor restaurant as a private enterprise for two
years now.
   Small, heavily regulated private enterprises are tolerated by
East Germany's communist authohrities on a limited scale.
   Kuenz said he and his wife had planned the move for several
years. As the departure date of July 1, 1986, approached, Kuenz
quit his job as a painter and his wife gave up her position as a
sales clerk.
   ``I worked until the day before we left,'' Kuenz said.
   ``Our decision to move was based on personal, not political
considerations,'' said Ingeborg Kuenz, 49, who grew up outside
Oranienburg with her aunt until she left East Germany illegally in
1956 to join her mother.
   ``I always considered this place my home.''
   But the Kuenzes acknowledge that they have risked much for an
uncertain future.
   ``We wouldn't be able to stand it if we couldn't leave for
visits,'' Werner Kuenz said, referring to East Germany's strict
limits on travel to the West.
   ``So far, all of our requests have been granted.''
   He said he was allowed to go to his class reunion in West
Germany.
   ``We had a little trouble with that one at first because it
isn't included in the government travel categories.''
   He said the family's trips to the West depend on the good will
of the authorities.
   Kuenz said the family also had to get used to living in a
society where consumer goods are sometimes scarce or difficult to
get on short notice.
   ``But we get by pretty well,'' Mrs. Kuenz said.
   She said the couple's 10-year-old son Udo had also adapted well
to their new environment.
   Werner Kuenz said it took a while for their East German
neighbors to adjust to them.
   After arriving in 1986, the couple set to work renovating the
house and the restaurant.
   ``People here aren't used to seeing people invest the amount of
time and energy into work,'' he said. ``They don't put that kind of
a day in down at the people's diner.''
   Now nearly finished, the establishment's colorful table
settings, potted plants and cheerful atmosphere set it apart from
the drab state-run restaurants down the cobbled road toward town.
   ``I wouldn't mind seeing a little free market economy around
here,'' Kuenz said, referring to the strict price guidelines he is
required by the state to charge.
   Kuenz admits that to keep the menu tasty, the family sometimes
has to dash to the hard currency ``Intershop'' store in East Berlin
for ketchup, spices and other essentials.
   Kuenz said customers continue to visit the bar just to ask why
the family had turned its back on a Western lifestyle many East
Germans would eagerly embrace.
   ``No one really comprehends it,'' Kuenz said, shrugging his
shoulders.

<HEAD>Ann Crumb Discovers ``Aspects'' of Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After appearing in the ill-fated Broadway run of
``Chess,'' Ann Crumb is on much firmer ground for her leading role
in Andrew Lloyd Webber's new megasmash, ``Aspects of Love.''
   The eagerly awaited musical opened April 17 at the Prince of
Wales Theater to an advance sale of $8.5 million, and is sold out
through 1989. Based on a little-known novel by English writer David
Garnett, ``Aspects of Love'' spans 17 years and much of Europe.
   It casts Crumb as Rose Vibert, a volatile French actress
enmeshed in romantic liaisons involving her husband, an expatriate
painter named George (Kevin Colson); his nephew, Alex (Michael
Ball); and George's Italian mistress, Giulietta (Kathleen Rowe
McAllen).
   It's the biggest exposure yet for the dark-haired, petite
actress, who keeps her age secret but looks 30ish. A chorus
performer in ``Chess'' and an alumna of ``Les Miserables'' both on
Broadway and on the road, Crumb finds herself tackling what she
calls ``the rangiest piece ever written in the musical theater.''
   The singing stretches her voice higher than ``Chess,'' and her
performance has won critical approval, with Jack Tinker in The
Daily Mail calling her work ``vibrantly intelligent and
commanding.''
   Crumb described the tempestuous Rose as ``a woman who lives on
the edge all the time.''
   ``She's the one who screams and cries and all that,'' Crumb
said. ``You can't say, `Isn't she pathetic?' or `She's so sweet.'
That's the challenge of carrying it.''
   Crumb's performing savvy comes naturally. Her father, George, is
the noted contemporary composer. Her mother, Elizabeth, teaches
music. Crumb intended to be a violinist, but had to give up when an
accident put her arm in plaster for two years. Singing seemed like
the next best bet, but she found herself daunted by her
surroundings.
   ``The irony was I was embarrassed to sing in a house where I'd
only heard some of the finest classical singers,'' she said. ``I
never opened my mouth in the house.''
   During college and graduate school at the University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor, Crumb performed on the side, while preparing for a
career in clinical medicine. It was only later, while working as a
clinician in her hometown of Philadelphia, that she took a job in
the national tour of ``El Grande de Coca Cola.''
   She was hooked.
   Crumb went into medicine because she wanted to help people. Now,
she says in an interview over lunch, she's finding that the theater
is also a way of giving something to people.
   Crumb is contracted to ``Aspects'' for six months as part of an
exchange agreement between New York and London branches of the
actors' union, Equity. She said she was the trade-off for Sarah
Brightman, Lloyd Webber's wife, who appeared in the Broadway
production of ``The Phantom of the Opera'' last year.
   She finds acting a fraught profession. ``There's really so
little work and so many terrific people.''
   However, she's pleased with the quantity of London theater,
which she said surpasses New York, and hopes to have a head start
when ``Aspects'' makes the inevitable move to Broadway.
   Still, despite sharing an apartment in London's posh Hampstead
district with her boyfriend, an American screenwriter, Crumb said
occasional pangs for New York do creep in.
   ``At first, I thought it was going to be hard to go back because
the quality of life here for the average person is much gentler and
kinder.
   ``But I must say in the last few weeks, I've gotten a little
homesick,'' she said. ``The other night after the show, we were
trying to find a place to eat, and there was no place to go.''

   Eleven days after a Central Park jogger was
raped and left for dead by a pack of marauding youths, David
Bruskin stepped into the last car of a subway train because he
didn't want his piccolo music to annoy others.
   It was a mistake.
   Two other people were in the car when he got on at 14th Street.
Five stops later, at 42nd Street, they had unwelcome company _ more
than a dozen youths, looking for trouble.
   They found Bruskin.
   Like swarming bees, the teen-agers surrounded him, snatched his
jacket, punched and bloodied his face, grabbed his wallet and broke
his tiny $500 instrument ``into smithereens.''
   Then they marched through the train, chins jutting out, eyes
darting left and right.
   With the laughter of three female members of the gang still
ringing in his ears, Bruskin yanked the car's emergency cord,
forcing the 5:30 a.m. Broadway local to a halt at the 59th Street
station.
   The 39-year-old teacher knew he was lucky to escape with just a
gash over one eye that was closed with three stitches.
   ``I feel very fortunate,'' he said.
   He knew about the 28-year-old woman who was jumped by a gang of
youths April 19 as she trotted through Central Park on her evening
run.
   She was dragged into the woods, beaten with a brick and a pipe,
raped repeatedly and left to die, her blood draining into a mud
puddle. After more than a week in a coma, she regained
consciousness, but a full recovery is questionable.
   Some authorities view these incidents as isolated extremes _ the
acts of a few city teen-agers who find strength and anonymity in
numbers. Others say the ``ultraviolence'' perpetrated by youth
gangs in ``A Clockwork Orange'' has arrived in New York.
   All agree something is very wrong, with these teen-agers, with
the juvenile justice system, or both.
   Usually, teen-agers join the loosely knit gangs spontaneously,
police say. They often strike in daylight after school, wreak havoc
for a few hours and disband; they have little more in common than
their age and lust for excitement.
   The city is still searching for a buzzword to describe them. The
youths are said to go ``wilding'' or ``wiling.'' They are ``wolf
packs'' or ``posses.''
   Tourists are frequent targets; the head of the police
department's midtown robbery squad once called them ``walking
statistics.''
   The tourists are often alone and vulnerable, wearing jewelry or
carrying thick wallets. They are outnumbered by roving columns of
teen-agers who have been known to parade through upscale stores,
grabbing what they like.
   Last year, 622 robbery cases and 140 attempted robbery cases
referred to Family Court involved two or more teens, and more than
100 cases of robberies, assaults and larcenies involved groups of
five or more, said Peter Reinharz, chief prosecutor for the city
Law Department's Family Court Division.
   ``In light of the escalation and severity of the incidents, it
appears that we're doing something wrong,'' Reinharz said.
   Rita Kramer, author of ``At A Tender Age: Violent Youth And
Juvenile Justice,'' noted in an interview the ineffectiveness of a
juvenile justice system that was set up to handle wayward youths
rather than young, hardened criminals.
   She said many youths report having committed about 10 serious
crimes for every one for which they are arrested.
   ``We're not doing a very good job of deterring or rehabilitating
kids,'' said James Payne, a former probation commissioner now in
private legal practice. ``They're not deterred and they're not
cured.''
   Kramer and Payne cited another Central Park attack in 1984 when
three youths, aged 12, 14 and 16, beat and raped a homeless woman
near the Conservatory Pond at 74th Street.
   She survived, but police later learned the same youths had raped
and killed another homeless resident of the park a month later.
   The 14-year-old was sentenced to five years to life as a
youthful offender after being tried as an adult. The 16-year-old,
who was convicted and sentenced as an adult, is serving 15 years to
life in a state prison.
   The 12-year-old, identified as the ringleader, was sent to Camp
Tryon, an unlocked facility in upstate New York, for up to 18
months. Payne said the youth remained incarcerated through his 13th
birthday but then escaped.
   The boy would now be 17. ``He's out there someplace and what
he's doing is not much different than what he was doing before he
was arrested,' Payne asserted.
   Reinharz said the system is too soft on children who commit
grisly crimes.
   ``The 12-year-old who commits a homicide is going to get the
same disposition as a 12-year-old who stole credit cards,''
Reinharz said.
   Bruskin recalled that his attackers were ``so matter of fact
about it. It was obvious they were used to what they were doing.
They looked at my possessions as things they were entitled to.''
   The piccolo player found two transit police officers in the
station and pointed out three or four members of the group that
attacked him. One youngster had been miraculously transformed; in
place of the tough glare and muscle-flexing march was the soft,
wide-eyed demeanor of a child.
   These youths were released. They were members of the gang, but
Bruskin said they were not among those who threw punches or robbed
him.
   Two witnesses were on hand. One handed Bruskin his wallet,
discarded after the teen-agers stripped it of $115. But the two
officers, joined within minutes by at least eight others, never
questioned the witnesses, Bruskin said.
   The arriving officers handcuffed and took away one boy Bruskin
said was in the group. He was later released when Bruskin said he
was only 85 percent sure he was the one who took his jacket.
   One witness, Chris Russel, 28, of the Bronx, recalled the horror
of what he had seen. ``There were so many of them,'' he said.
``They just came and started beating on him.''
   The other witness, Richard McMillan, 30, of Manhattan, said he
could feel danger as soon as the youths came into the car.
   ``He didn't feel it because he was too happy playing his
flute,'' McMillan said.

   Did anybody who wasn't down a well miss the
mass-publicized rescue of little Jessica McClure, the Texas toddler?
   For those who missed it or just want to relive it, ABC offers a
dramatized replay Sunday in ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of
Jessica McClure.''
   Roxana Zal, who won an Emmy Award two years ago for ``Something
About Amelia,'' plays Cissy McClure, the young mother who realizes
that her 18-month-old baby has disappeared into an 8-inch opening
in the ground. Will Oldham plays her husband, Chip. Veteran film
actor Pat Hingle is no-nonsense, good-ol'-boy Fire Chief James
Roberts. Beau Bridges plays Richard Czech, the overly optimistic
chief of police. Patty Duke plays Carolyn Henry, a victim's
assistance volunteer who stayed with the McClures through the
ordeal.
   The movie is a well-acted, well-directed, straightforward
retelling of the drama. In fact, during the first hour, we may
wonder why we must engage in this seemingly pointless re-creation
exercise.
   But the rescue of the tot who, in October 1987, fell down an
abandoned water well in her aunt's Midland, Texas, backyard,
catches hold in the second hour, when the drama escalates and the
filmmakers' purpose begins to emerge. As we begin to suspect, and
are assured in a tag-line message at the conclusion, the movie is a
tribute to volunteerism.
   Scriptwriter David Eyre Jr. and director Mel Damski capture
moments of humor, as well as the horror of the situation, and such
subleties as Cissy's fear of informing her house-painter husband
that she lost the baby down a well. Eyre's dialogue is pretty
credible West Texas-ese. Pet peeve: Zal tells Duke at one point,
``ya'll don't look old enough'' to have a grown daughter. ``Ya'll''
ain't singular. It means ``you all,'' as in two or more of you.
   Except for a few scene-setters filmed in Midland, the movie was
shot in Bellflower, Calif. The set designers did such a good job
re-creating the scene, it might be hard to tell, if they were shown
side by side, which is the real footage of the rescue and which is
the movie. Viewers of the movie get to go where they did not during
the news coverage _ down the shaft rescuers dug through solid rock
alongside the well.
   There was some bickering in Midland last year over who should
get the rights to the story. Eventually those involved settled on
Interscope Productions in association with the Campbell Soup Co.
The real-life folks in Midland-Odessa who are depicted in the film
ought to be pretty happy with the results, since they're portrayed
as good-hearted, right-thinking people ready to do absolutely
anything to save someone else's baby.
   The Chamber of Commerce might not be overly delighted with the
opening establishing shots of rusting oil-field equipment, but the
scenes effectively depict the state of the oil economy at the time
_ down a dry hole itself. That underlines the generosity of the oil
industry that brought in experts and equipment to help save
Jessica, at no small cost.
   The rescue was the biggest media event of the year. But, as
usual, the news media are a faceless mass of shouting imbeciles
blinding decent folk with flashbulbs and TV lights _ as they no
doubt appeared to the McClures at the time. There is one exception.
KMID-TV reporter Rodney Wunsch, who plays himself, stays on the
story so long without sleep, he gets into a hysterical shouting
match with one of the police officers and has to be sent home for
awhile.
   Most touching is the portrayal of emergency medical technician
Robert O'Donnell (Whip Hubley), who must confront his fear of the
gravelike shaft, then can't quite reach the child on the first try
and has to come up empty-handed. A doctor on the scene warns him
before his second attempt that the child's time is running out and
if he has to break her bones to get her out, he should.
   At the conclusion, when Cissy is sitting in the waiting
ambulance and hears the cheers go up from the crowd in the
backyard, it's almost like watching the real scenes that the
networks interrupted prime-time for in 1987. It's not a bad moment
to re-create.

   Elsewhere in television:
   YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW _ ABC has ratted on 3 million women it
says watch soap operas at work. The network's motive was not
tattle-tale, but rather to make the point that the Nielsen ratings
don't necessarily reflect all the viewers of daytime drama. ABC
said a survey it conducted showed that 8 percent of women who watch
soap operas do so at their place of business. That comes out to 2.8
million working women sneaking peeks at daytime dramas while the
boss isn't looking _ unless, of course, they're the boss, in which
case go right ahead.

<HEAD>Big Changes Since the 1970s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Factors helping to restrain inflation today are
the experience of the 1970s, the lingering pains associated with it
and a determination not to let it happen again.
   You can see it in the marked resistance to price increases these
days, especially in the automobile market but also in retailing,
housing, insurance, travel and several other product and service
areas.
   The 1980s are not like the 1970s in that respect. Back then, an
attitude prevailed that existing prices were the best that would be
seen for a while, so why not buy. Today's consumer prefers to wait
and see.
   In the 1970s, many consumers, and producers too, didn't care as
much about holding the price line. For consumers, automatic pay
raises took care of higher living costs. For businesses, price
increases were regular.
   In the 1980s, automatic cost-of-living adjustments are less
common than before. Unions aren't as strong and businesses are more
intent on keeping down labor costs. They have to.
   The reason is competition. Today's markets are much more global
in nature, and that means a manufacturer must keep prices in line
or a foreign competitor will undersell him. It's happened before,
and it might again.
   That same factor prevents foreigners from raising their prices
in the United States. With the decline in the value of the dollar,
American producers are more competitive. Foreigners, therefore,
must fight for markets here.
   In general, these foreign producers have been good fighters;
many, in fact, have chosen to hold prices low by ``eating'' some of
their expenses rather than passing them on. That is, they have
voluntarily cut their margins.
   Third parties were a big factor in consumer, or demand
inflation, during the 1970s. Americans learned from that
experience, particularly in regard to health insurance and many
contracts now limit the role of the third party.
   The most specific example of this change is the tendency of
employers today to lower their involvement in paying for health
policies from 100 percent, with workers picking up the difference.
   When you pay for a service yourself, if only partially, you are
less likely to overuse it, or at least that's one of the
conclusions at work today based on the experience of the '70s.
   Unfortunately, health care remains an inflation problem in the
'80s, and probably will continue to be so in the 1990s. The reason
isn't a mystery if you consider the question: How do you control
spending when lives are at stake?
   Still another similarity exists between the '70s and the '80s:
the inability of consumers to resist price increases dictated by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   But in those other respects, the American challenge to inflation
this decade is a sharp contrast to its acquiescence to inflation in
the prior one. History, at least recent history, hasn't been
ignored.

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Exert Pressure on Television Advertisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that organizers contend is ``the largest coalition of
Christians ever mobilized to deal with an urgent moral concern'' is
targeting television advertisers in a campaign to reduce sex and
violence on the small screen.
   Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLEAR-TV,
recently put advertisers on notice: If they are among the top 10
sponsors of sex, violence and profanity on network television
during the May ``sweeps'' period, when ratings determine rates for
advertisers, they may become boycott targets.
   ``We'll pick one or two corporations out of that list, and we're
going to boycott them,'' said the Rev. Billy Melvin, chairman of
CLEAR-TV. ``By early June, we'll announce who's going to be
boycotted.''
   With more than 1,600 Christian leaders backing it, CLEAR-TV is
no ordinary pressure group. The coalition features top officials
from 70 mainline and conservative Protestant denominations and more
than 100 Roman Catholic bishops, including such heavyweights as
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago and Archbishop John L. May of
St. Louis, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The group relies on the monitoring system of the Rev. Donald
Wildmon's Tupelo, Miss.-based American Family Association. He's a
United Methodist.
   ``I think it's an idea not only whose time has come, but it's
long overdue,'' said the Rev. Milton Efthimious, a founder of
CLEAR-TV and executive director of the Department of Church and
Society of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America.
``A lot of the things you see on television today would never have
been shown 15 years ago.''
   Melvin said the coalition turned to advertisers after network
executives ignored an appeal to voluntarily reduce the portrayals
of sex, violence and profanity on the small screen.
   The coalition's last attempt two years ago at a boycott of
advertisers was successful, Melvin said, with both Noxell Corp. and
Mazda Motor of America Inc. dropping out of CLEAR-TVs ``top 10''
list of advertisers sponsoring offensive programs.
   Melvin said the boycott of Noxell, maker of Cover Girl
cosmetics, was lifted within two months, and the boycott of Mazda
was dropped after four months.
   Both companies said CLEAR-TV made them more sensitive to the
type of programs they were sponsoring, but said the actions they
took conformed to their own standards.
   Albert Goldberg of the Mazda Information Bureau in Los Angeles
said the company stopped advertising on ``Miami Vice'' and
``Hunter,'' two shows criticized for excessive violence, ``on our
own accord.''
   He added, ``It is true it was brought to our attention by
CLEAR-TV.''
   Deborah A. Alford, manager of corporate communications for
Noxell, said after discussions with CLEAR-TV, the company
``formalized what was an existing policy'' to steer away from
programming that is overly violent or contains gratuitous sex and
profanity.
   Earlier this year, Tambrands Inc., Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,
McDonald's Corp. and Kimberly Clark Corp. decided not to advertise
on Fox Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Married ... With Children.'' The
corporate decisions followed a letter-writing campaign by Terry
Rakolta, a Michigan woman who objected to the sexual innuendo and
the treatment of women in the popular comedy about a blue-collar
family.
   Melvin of Wheaton, Ill., who also is executive director of the
National Association of Evangelicals, said advertisers are saying,
``For crying out loud, give us something decent to present to the
American public.''
   The networks have taken a low profile toward groups such as
CLEAR-TV, and some advertising agencies say they face a dilemma in
balancing concerns about sex and violence while meeting their
clients' needs.
   ``ABC has chosen not to comment on the operations of this
organization,'' said Janice Gretemeyer, director of press relations
for ABC.
   Thomas Somerset, an executive at the advertising firm handling
Mazda's account, said it is a sensitive issue because viewers tend
to be attracted to things that are sensational, but companies do
not want to run the risk of being targeted by groups such as
CLEAR-TV.
   ``Do these groups have an influence in what goes on? Yes. Is it
right? I'm not sure,'' said Somerset, a senior vice president of
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding.
   Leaders of CLEAR-TV such as Efthimious expressed mixed opinions
about the tactics of pressuring advertisers, but he said the
networks have to take repsonsibility for the ``slime and sleaze''
sent into American homes.
   ``The thing I'm uncomfortable about is I don't think the church
or the synagogue should be an inquisition,'' Efthimious said.
``But, by the same token, I don't think the media should hide
behind the First Amendment.''
   Roman Catholic Bishop Stanislaus J. Brzana of Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
a member of the executive committee of CLEAR-TV, said the religious
community is exercising its own right to free speech.
   ``We are also citizens of this country. The airwaves belong to
everybody,'' he said. ``We are trying in a fair way to exert our
influence. We don't know how far we will get, but we are trying. We
are trying.''

   With a finger pointed to the rear of the church,
the minister commanded a young man to stand.
   ``Michael Stone!'' said the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood before
1,000 witnesses. ``I'm goin' a tell you what my mama once told me:
At the rate you're goin', someone's goin' a kill you. Man, you got
a baaaaad attitude. You hear me?
   ``And friends of Michael's, if you see him in trouble, you jack
his ass right up, you deal with him. You hear me?''
   The St. Paul Community Baptist Church congregation heard, all
right, punctuating his scolding with amens and yessirs.
   Youngblood's words were daring, but his daring has a solid
record:
   _As co-chairman of the East Brooklyn Congregations, a group of
55 churches and a synagogue, he led an effort that turned an
abandoned section of eastern Brooklyn into a community of
working-class families by building 1,250 homes. The project, called
Nehemiah after the Biblical prophet who rebuilt the walls of a
burned-out Jerusalem, has inspired similar plans in Baltimore and
Los Angeles. Congress recently passed a ``Nehemiah'' law that
provides incentives for cities to copy the Brooklyn project.
   _He formed an alliance two years ago with city banks to secure
jobs for black high school graduates; 300 now have entry-level
positions.
   _And the church, located in one of New York City's toughest
areas, was surrounded by storefront drug operations until he
lobbied police to enforce a law that locked up buildings in which
people were arrested for drugs; then, the church bought 14
properties. The church now rents 11 stores and three houses.
   ``We need a whole new culture,'' the 40-year-old Youngblood said
in an interview. ``And I think the church might have to become the
incubator.''
   Politicians, community activists and preachers from more than
100 cities have made pilgrimmages to Nehemiah homes. Many then go
to hear Youngblood's gospel.
   ``He's a new type of leader,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo, one of
those escorted by Youngblood to the homes. ``He's good at putting
together coalitions and working cooperatively. ... There's none of
the demagogue in him.''
   ``He's making the Old Testament come alive,'' said Michael
Gecan, the New York area organizer for the Industrial Areas
Foundation, a group founded by the late Saul Alinsky to train
community organizers and build citizen groups. ``He's becoming a
national leader, quietly.''
   Some black leaders say too quietly.
   ``As a clergyman, he's a premier example of the strong, new
black clergy today,'' said the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the
Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and a civil rights activist.
``But in terms of whether he's had a profound impact on the major
issues this city faces today, I say he has no public presence.
   ``On the issue of police brutality, when you look at the number
of people who took radical stands, Johnny Ray Youngblood is not
there. When you think of the lack of proper health care for the
poor, Johnny Ray Youngblood is not there. And at a time when we
need new leaders in this city to improve the climate of racial
tension, he has not spoken out,'' Butts said.
   ``Speaking out,'' said Youngblood, ``is not always the best way
to get results. I think I am involved in the vital issues. Housing
is one. Education is one.''
   And yet Youngblood has found that his behind-the-scenes work has
not led to more Nehemiah homes elsewhere in New York _ and he's
starting to speak out.
   ``We will build in the South Bronx,'' Youngblood told a crowd of
5,000 at a recent rally at a 4.2-acre Bronx site that is now all
rubble and broken glass.
   The demonstration came after Mayor Edward Koch had rebuffed
Nehemiah backers who wanted to build homes there. Koch favors a
developer's plan to build 350 condominiums, starting at $95,000,
while Nehemiah wants to build 90 homes, beginning at $57,000.
   Nehemiah depends on interest-free loans from a $10 million
church fund, large tracts of land donated by the city, property tax
abatements and city grants of $10,000 a house.
   ``You will own homes in the South Bronx,'' Youngblood vowed.
``The South Bronx may look like a graveyard, but all resurrecting
takes place in graveyards.''
   Youngblood is a Southerner, raised in a three-room house in New
Orleans by a God-fearing mother and a stern father. In his youth,
he liked ``to go out with the guys, run with the girls,'' but his
mother set him straight. ``Her word was like the echo of God,'' he
said.
   He earned a master's degree in divinity in Rochester, N.Y., and
in 1974, St. Paul's deacons hired him.
   He was 26, married, with an infant son.
   ``We were looking for a leader,'' recalled William Brandon, a
church member since 1934 and a deacon in 1974. ``We had been
through a lot of crises with different ministers. We decided to
turn him loose.''
   Then, the congregation had only 72 people.
   But Youngblood's oratory and community work drew scores of
newcomers. In 1979, the congregation moved to a bigger building,
which they expanded this year.
   Now, St. Paul has 4,500 members.
   The church has a $2.5 million budget, 27 staff members, 400
volunteer workers and an elementary school. About 45 percent of the
families are tithers, meaning they pledge 10 percent of their
salaries to the church.
   Crowds of 1,000 or more pack the two Sunday services, which
begin the instant music director Eli Wilson hits the keys of an
electronic keyboard. The 80-member choir, two drummers and
congregation are a beat behind and in seconds people are up,
clapping their hands and stamping their feet. The floor bounces.
   From the pulpit, Youngblood is part entertainer and part
teacher. He is funny at times, fiery at times, straight-talking all
times.
   He asks the black men to stand, visitors to stand and children
with report cards to come to the front as their grades are read.
There is calculation in this: He wants more men to come, more new
members and better grades for the children.
   The reverend pays special attention to young people. ``We are
rallying around the African proverb that it takes a whole village
to raise a child,'' he said in an interview.
   Michael Stone knows.
   ``It was hard to hear what he said,'' the 17-year-old said a few
weeks after Youngblood disciplined him from the pulpit for getting
into a fight after Bible class.
   ``But I've been controlling my temper better these days,'' he
said. ``His doing that made a lot of people keep an eye out on me.
It helped.''

   WPP Group PLC said it had agreed to acquire its
rival Ogilvy Group Inc. for $864 million in a deal that would
create the world's second largest advertising and marketing
services company.
   The announcement, which was made shortly after midnight, said
the London-based WPP Group would pay $54 a share for all of
Ogilvy's common stock. The agreement was approved by the boards of
both companies.
   Ogilvy began formal dicussions with the London-based WPP last
week after WPP indicated it was willing to pay more than $50 a
share.

   Early May sales of cars and trucks made by
U.S.-based automakers dropped 8.2 percent compared with last year,
when consumers were flocking to showrooms before incentives
expired, the companies reported.
   The eight major companies making vehicles in North America said
Monday they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of
36,480 during the May 1-10 period this year, compared with a rate
of 39,771 during the same time last year.
   Cars sold at a rate 9.8 percent lower than in early May last

   The U.S. industrial operating rate rose
moderately to 83.9 percent in April, but factories remain under
less strain than when the year began, the government said.
   Although the Federal Reserve Board's report Monday showed
industry using more of its capacity last month, it revised its
figures for the first three months of the year to show less
activity than previously reported.
   The capacity rate hit its most recent peak of 84.3 percent in
December _ a 10-year high. The rate held steady in January and

decision that permitted lawsuits under an anti-fraud provision of
the Securities Act of 1933. The case stemmed from a challenge by 17

<TEXT>
   There may be fewer and smaller leveraged buyouts
these days, but LBOs are still a thriving investment and a popular
way to finance corporate acquisitions, economists say.
   ``Wall Street is awash in funds,'' said Robert B. Reich,
professor of political economics and management at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   ``Financial entrepreneurs are at this moment cooking up a
variety of schemes for those funds. ... LBO lovers will be among
them,'' he said Monday.
   Reich and other economists disagreed with a statement by Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that LBOs _ in which
companies are acquired primarily with borrowed funds _ have reached
their peak.
   The Fed chairman, who spoke over the weekend to a group of top
corporate executives in Hot Springs, Va., said the number of
debt-financed takeovers will decline because ``the easiest, obvious
ones'' already have been done.
   ``Greenspan is being overly optimistic,'' said Reich, referring
to the fact that the Fed chairman, like many other critics of LBOs,
would like to see highly-leveraged transactions subside.
   Donald Ratajczk, director of economic forecasting at Georgia
State University in Atlanta, also disagreed with Greenspan, saying,
``I wouldn't say they have peaked _ I would say there's a lull.''
   Recent statistics support the theory that LBO activity has
slowed somewhat. The number of leveraged buyouts declined during
the first quarter to 40 deals of $10 million or more from 57 in a
year earlier, according to Securities Data Co., a New Jersey-based
research firm.
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the economic forecasting
service Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said rising prices and
interest rates and the slowing of the economy may have dampened LBO
activity.
   But LBOs are still attractive to investors and takeover
strategists, many analysts say.
   ``The thing that motivated LBOs in large part was the tax
system,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, noting that corporate acquirers enjoy hefty tax
deductions for the interest they pay on LBO loans.
   ``That situation still persists,'' Rahn said. ``I would not
think you would have a fundamental change until we had a more basic
change in the tax law.''
   Rahn agreed with Greenspan that after LBOs were developed,
prospective buyers looked around for the best targets, and with
those companies _ most notably RJR Nabisco Inc. _ there are fewer
buyouts to be made.
   But David Wyss, chief financial economist with DRI-McGraw Hill
in Lexington, Mass., disagreed. ``There's still some big ones out
there that they could do. There's rumors about almost everything
flying around.
   ``No one thought about RJR till it happened,'' Wyss said,
adding, ``I'm not as convinced as (Greenspan) is that the
enthusiasm is over.''
   The $24.53 billion RJR Nabisco deal, engineered by LBO
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., focused public attention
on leveraged buyouts and raised concerns among economists _
including Greenspan _ about the high level of corporate debt in
this country.
   Critics say that in the event of an economic downturn, both the
bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction could be
jeopardized.
   Some economists say large issues of junk bonds used to finance
deals like the RJR Nabisco buyout have temporarily glutted the
market, but they expect demand to increase once the new issues are
fully absorbed into the system.
   ``With the success of RJR, we'll see activity back up again,''
said Georgia State's Ratajczk.
   Junk bonds have high yields, and institutional investors are
still eager to buy them, Ratajczk said. In the process, these
investors help keep the LBO boom alive.

<HEAD>Prime Challenges Hostile Suitor To Put Money Where Mouth Is</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc., the embattled minicomputer
maker, is challenging hostile suitor Bennett S. LeBow to put his
money where his mouth is.
   ``Talk is cheap, Mr. LeBow,'' Prime Chairman David J. Dunn said
in full-page newspaper ads appearing today addressed to the New
York investor whose MAI Basic Four Inc. has launched a
$20-per-share offer for Prime's outstanding stock.
   Prime's board sent the same feisty letter to LeBow on Monday.
   ``MAI has had more than six months to obtain the necessary
financing to consummate its tender offer. Can you deliver on your
offer, Mr. LeBow? We do not believe that you can,'' the ads said.
   In a gamble that could backfire, the ad said Prime would
temporarily remove all legal obstacles to LeBow's offer. If he can
complete the cash offer by June 2, the ad said, it would allow the
deal to go through.
   But if he cannot, the ads and letter said, ``we trust that you
will finally withdraw your offer and let Prime go on with its
business.''
   MAI Basic spokeswoman Toni Lee said only that the company was
``evaluating the situation.''
   The tender offer by MAI, a Tustin, Calif.-based computer firm
about one-fourth the size of Prime, is valued at about $970 million.
   Prime's board said last month it was seeking a friendly buyer
willing to pay a higher price and would vigorously defend itself in
a proxy battle with LeBow at its annual meeting, scheduled for June
14.
   Wall Street analysts said Monday it appeared that Prime had been
unable to find a ``white knight'' to outbid LeBow and decided to
take a bold gamble instead.
   ``What Prime's management is gambling on is that LeBow won't be
able to come up with the financing and Prime will win the proxy
fight as a result,'' said Jay P. Stevens, an analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``They're giving him a couple of weeks to put up or shut up,''
Stevens added.
   Prime's letter, signed by Dunn on behalf of the board, said the
company would disarm all its takeover defenses, including its
so-called poison pill, to allow MAI Basic ``or any bona fide
bidder'' to purchase the company for $20 a share in cash before
June 2.
   In addition, Prime said it would exempt the purchase from a
Delaware law that requires hostile buyers to obtain at least 85
percent of the outstanding stock of a target company or wait three
years before making any significant changes in the business.
   Finally, Prime told LeBow that ``promptly upon your purchase,''
the company would withdraw without predjudice its legal challenges
to the takeover bid.
   Analysts said the letter amounts to a broadside at both MAI
Basic and its investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which
is arranging financing for the $20-per-share offer.

   Seymour Cray will break from the company he
founded in 1972 to finish building what he says will be the world's
fastest supercomputer _ a project analysts say became too risky for
industry giant Cray Research Inc.
   Under a restructuring announced Monday, Cray Research will split
into two companies with the formation of Cray Computer Corp. Cray
Chairman John Rollwagen will discuss the decision at today's annual
shareholders' meeting.
   The new company will be formed around Cray-3 operations in
Colorado Springs, Colo., where Seymour Cray has been busy designing
a machine that uses gallium arsenide instead of silicon to speed
computations.
   ``Seymour will once again be in the kind of environment in which
he thrives, and in which he and his team can aggressively pursue
completion of the Cray-3 and bring it to market,'' Rollwagen said.
   Seymour Cray will become chairman of the new company, which will
receive up to $50 million in equipment and $100 million in
operating funds over the next two years from its parent company,
said John Swenson, a company spokesman.
   The split comes in response to the overwhelming cost of
developing new generations of supercomputers. The race for
supremacy has become even fiercer recently with the emergence of
Japan's Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. as strong
competitors.
   Control Data Corp., a Twin Cities neighbor of Cray, last month
announced it was shutting down its own supercomputer operation, ETA
Systems, because of the financial drain. Seymour Cray worked for
Control Data before founding Cray Research in 1972.
   Rollwagen said the split will allow work to proceed on two
development thrusts _ the Cray-3 in Colorado Springs under the new
company and the C-90 in Chippewa Falls, Wis., under the existing
company.
   The C-90 is the next generation of the company's
bread-and-butter X-MP machines, of which about 150 are in place.
The Y-MP is a recent successor to the X-MP.
   The announcement was made after the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, but rumors of the restructuring prompted a
price increase of $2.62{ a share to $55.75. The stock traded around
$48 early last week.
   Analysts said the move appears to be designed to cap the amount
of money Cray spends on the development of the Cray-3, which could
be running behind schedule.
   ``What it does is, if this Cray-3 continues to run over budget
and $100 million is not sufficient, then the new company, Cray
Computer Corp., has to go out and find new money,'' said Stephen
Cohen of SoundView Financial Group of Stamford, Conn.
   Seymour Cray's new company almost certainly will have to raise
more money, probably by going into partnership with another
computer company, said Jeffrey Canin, a San Francisco-based
computer analyst.
   The Cray-3, using the gallium arsenide metal alloy as a
semiconductor instead of the traditional silicon, will be a
successor to Seymour Cray's Cray-2.
   The Cray-3 and Cray-2 are designed to have at least four times
as much memory as the other Cray machines and compute at a faster
rate. But only about 20 of the Cray-2 machines have been sold.
   ``If Seymour has any trouble with the Cray-3, it doesn't
endanger the other part of the business,'' George Lindamood of the
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., said. ``I think it's a good
move.''
   But Peter Zidek, a supercomputer analyst from the Minneapolis
suburb of Apple Valley, questioned the move. Even though plans call
for the sharing of some technology, the two companies will become
rivals, he said.
   ``It seems like maybe there was a spat'' between Seymour Cray,
who stepped down from his administrative post in 1980 to devote
himself to research, and company administrators, Zidek said.
   Cray is the largest supercomputer maker in the world, not
counting International Business Machines Corp., which sells
attachments to some of its mainframes that allows them to work like
supercomputers.
   ``This is one American industry that is not walking away from
global competition,'' Rollwagen said. ``Rather, we're in effect
redoubling our effort.''
   Cray will seek Internal Revenue Service and regulatory approval
to distribute 90 percent of the stock in the new company to
shareholders of Cray Research Inc. on a tax-free basis. Cray
Research will retain the other 10 percent.
   The two companies will enter into cross-licensing and technology
transfer agreements involving both hardware and software. The
approximately 200 employees in Colorado Springs will become
employees of the new company. Cray has a total of about 5,400
workers.

<HEAD>Time Inc.'s HBO Unit to Launch Comedy Channel on Basic Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pay-television programmer Home Box Office
Inc. said today it plans to launch the first advertiser-supported
channel devoted entirely to comedy starting this fall.
   The new service, which would be offered to cable operators for
inclusion at no extra charge to subscribers to their basic service,
would represent the Time Inc. unit's first venture into basic cable
programming.
   The new service will have to fight for channel space with
several other recently launched cable networks. Among the newcomers
are Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Turner Network Television,
the National Broadcasting Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel
and an array of regional sports networks.
   Michael Fuchs, Home Box Office chairman and chief executive,
said in a news release disclosing the plans that his company has
presented the concept of a comedy network to cable operators across
the country over the past several months and that the idea has
received ``strong support.''
   ``We anticipate demographics that will attract strong advertiser
attention, consistent programming that will score well with
consumers and a new basic service that will generate a healthy cash
flow for the cable operator,'' he said.
   Home Box Office could face competition from the MTV Networks
division of Viacom Inc., which also is considering launching an
all-comedy network.
   Home Box Office currently operates the HBO and Cinemax pay-TV
services, which already include comedy shows within their lineup of
movies, sports, music, drama, documentaries and other special
programs.
   Fuchs said the concept of a comedy channel appealed to ``a
number of motion picture distributors'' who he said liked the
promotional opportunities the channel offers for generating
awareness of their comedy programs.
   The channel will feature comedy hosts who will have their own
shows incorporating a variety of programming ranging from
promotional clips from stand-up performances, current comedy films,
classic TV shows and theater to full-length motion pictures. There
also will be live comedy features and visits by established and new
comedians.
   Programming would originate from studio facilities in New York.
   Fuchs said Home Box Office has already established strong
professional relationships with the comedy community through HBO's
involvement dating to 1976 with its ``On Location'' series that has
featured comedians such as Rodney Dangerfield, Robin Williams and
Steve Martin.
   He said HBO research indicates comedy programs maintain higher
ratings even over repeated viewings than non-comedy programs and
that 64 percent of cable subscribers between ages 18 and 34 have
expressed interest in a comedy channel.
   Barry Kluger, a spokesman for MTV Networks, said MTV has been
looking into whether a comedy channel could make it for five years
and may make a decision soon on whether to launch an all-comedy
service.
   ``We have tried to put together a business plan. We are active
in that. It's something that is on front burner. But the key is
distribution,'' he said.
   He said there is ``so little space these days'' on cable systems
that a waiting list of cable networks has developed at some of them.
   But he noted that MTV already has considerable experience in
running basic cable services, including its MTV: Music Television,
VH-1 and Nickelodeon networks.

percent during early May from the same period last year, when
procrastinating customers headed to showrooms to take advantage of
incentives.
   The eight major companies making cars and light trucks in North
America said Monday they sold a combined average of 36,480 vehicles
a day during the May 1-10 period this year. That compared with an
average of 39,771 during the same time last year. Car sales were
down 9.8 percent and truck sales were off 5.3 percent.
   But year-to-year comparison was colored by one of the strongest
10-day periods last year, the second-best selling year in auto
industry history. A large portion of the incentives in effect in
early May last year expired May 11, prompting buyers who had waited
to head to dealerships to take advantage of the enticements.
   Incentives also were in effect during the period this year. Ford
Motor Co.'s program expires May 31, General Motors Corp.'s dies
June 5 and Chrysler Corp.'s runs indefinitely. All offer buyers the
option of cash rebates or low-interest financing.
   Despite the statistical drop, dealers said Monday that business
was good.
   ``We had a very good March, April and May last year,'' said Joe
Matts, new car sales manager at Jones-West Ford-Mitsubishi in Reno,
Nev. ``If you compare it to last year, it's off, but that was a
very good year.''
   Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox Chevrolet-Geo in Chattanooga,
Tenn., agreed, saying incentives helped sales.
   ``Most of them are taking the money,'' he said of the rebates.
``We're doing little or none on financing.''
   The automakers began the incentive programs at the start of the
second quarter after sales during the first three months came in
below expectations. Production continued at an ambitious pace,
meaning swelling inventories.
   Incentives have helped trim inventory levels, but analysts now
say that production cuts in the third period are likely.
   For the year, the companies reported car and truck sales running
4.1 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales off 6.1 percent
and truck sales down 0.5 percent.
   GM's car sales fell 9.5 percent during the May 1-10 period and
were 10.6 percent below the 1988 year-to-date rate. GM's truck
sales were up 6.1 percent in early May but down 0.5 percent for the
year.
   Ford's car sales were off 11.1 percent in early May and down 0.8
percent for the year. The company's light truck sales during early
May this year were 11.9 percent behind last year's rate and 3.6
percent lower than the year-to-date rate last year.
   Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.6 percent during the period and
were running 16.8 percent behind last year's pace. Sales of
Chrysler's light truck sales were off 9.3 percent for the period
and up 1.1 percent for the year.

<HEAD>EEC Adopts New Labelling Laws for Tobacco Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All cigarette packets sold in the
European Economic Community will have to carry specific health
warnings from Jan. 1, 1993, the EEC decided Tuesday.
   In addition, they will have to carry a general warning that
``Tobacco Seriously Damages Health'' which will also have to be
carried by products such as pipe tobacco.
   ``Smoking Causes Cancer,'' ``Smoking Causes Fatal Diseases,''
``Pregnant Women, Smoking Harms Your Baby'' and ``Smokers Die
Younger'' are some of the specific warnings which will have to
appear on cigarette packs.
   Ministers from the 12 EEC member states also agreed at a meeting
on Tuesday that the warnings should be clear and legible, printed
in bold letters and should not be printed on external wrappers or
where they would be damaged when the package is opened.
   The new law specified that the warning must cover at least 4
percent of the packet in countries where there is one official
language. If there are two official languages 6 percent of the
surface must be covered and where there are three official
languages, 8 percent must be covered.
   Tar and nicotine levels must also be clearly indicated on
cigarette packs and must take up the same surface as the health
warning.
   Britain, although bound by the majority decision, was the only
EEC member state to vote against the new law, saying that it went
beyond the EEC's powers to adopt legislation to complete the
internal market by the end of 1992.
   By this date, all barriers to the free movement of goods,
capital, people and services between the 12-nation trade bloc
should be dismantled.
   But the EEC Commission argued that all tobacco products must be
labeled in the same way otherwise countries could refuse their
entry on the grounds that they were incorrectly labeled.
   The World Health Organization estimates that 440,000 EEC
citizens die every year from diseases caused by smoking.

<HEAD>Oil-Injured Otters Returned to Prince William Sound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven otters pulled from oil-polluted
Prince William Sound nearly two months ago have become the first to
be returned to the waterway and are tagged with radar clips for
monitoring.
   The otter release came as commercial fishermen opened the
halibut season Monday and a day before today's start of hearings
into the nation's worst oil spill.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 on a charted reef
25 miles south of Valdez. It leaked nearly 11 million gallons of
oil, polluting hundreds of miles of shoreline and killing countless
birds, fish and marine mammals.
   The four male and three female otters were freed Monday into
Simpson Bay, about 25 miles northwest of Cordova.
   ``That's something very measurable,'' said Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Clyde Robbins, the federal cleanup coordinator. ``Everybody can see
that and understand that, and that's why I like it.''
   The first otter was released at the shore of a shale- and
shell-covered beach. She waddled into the water, turned around and
lifted a paw as if to wave at the 30 onlookers, who cheered at the
sight.
   The animals had been undergoing treatment at an Exxon-funded
rehabilitation center in Valdez where 45 other otters remain under
observation.
   ``It's the happiest day for the otter rescue center,'' Director
Randall Davis said.
   Simpson Bay was chosen because it was untouched by oil, has a
stable food source and has a large otter population, Davis said.
   Despite the radar, tracking won't be easy, biologist Chuck
Monnett said. The signals can be picked up only while the flippers
are out of the water, but wildlife watchers hope the flippers'
movement during swimming will provide an adequate signal.
   ``This will be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the
animals' behavior once they are returned to the wild,'' biologist
Gary Sonnevil said.
   The seven otters were selected because they appeared fully
rehabilitated. ``Blood samples appear normal, and the otters' fur
once again will fully insulate the animals,'' Davis said.
   The first 24-hour halibut season of the spring opened with Coast
Guard pilots guiding fishermen away from oil.
   ``Very few areas where halibut fishing takes place had any free
floating oil and it looks good,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike Donohoe
said.
   State and federal inspectors will check the catch to ensure no
tainted fish wind up on anyone's table, said Bob Trumble, a
biologist with the International Pacific Halibut Commission in
Seattle.
   The number of halibut fishing periods set by the commission
depends on how many fish are caught; the yearly quota could be
caught in just three openers. More than 60 million pounds of the
large, flounder-like fish were caught off Alaska last year and sold
for $74.5 million.
   Because of the pollution, the state earlier canceled or
postponed herring, black cod and shrimp harvests in the sound, and
closed some herring fishing grounds.
   Mild weather helped more than 125 workers finish cleaning up
Green Island in time for the sea lion calving season there.
   Monday was the deadline for Exxon to clean oil from rookeries on
the northwest corner of the island.
   ``It looks a lot better than last week,'' Robbins said after
viewing the area, which was cleaned with peat moss and absorbent
pads.
   ``I'm very pleased with the peat moss,'' Robbins said. ``It
absorbs the oil that's under the rocks. It washes off and is
biodegradable.''
   In Anchorage, officials gathered for a week of hearings by the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   Crewmembers of the Exxon Valdez were the first scheduled to
testify before a panel that includes representatives from the NTSB,
the state, Exxon, Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a
consortium of oil companies that runs the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil
pipeline.
   More than two dozen witnesses were expected to testify,
including Coast Guard personnel and Exxon executives. The board's
report on the probable cause will take up to a year to complete,
said Drucella Andersen, an NTSB spokeswoman.
   The vessel's fired captain, Joseph Hazelwood, will not testify
but has offered written testimony to the board, Andersen said.
   Hazelwood, who is free on $50,000 bail, has been charged with
operating a vessel while drunk and goes on trial June 20. He faces
two years, three months in jail and $11,000 in fines if convicted.

<HEAD>City, Westchester County Lift Drought Restrictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City declared an end to drought
restrictions on water use after recent heavy rains filled upstate
reservoirs to nearly 90 percent.
   ``I asked people to pray for rain and the prayers worked,'' said
Mayor Edward I. Koch Monday. ``Thank you, New York for praying and
conserving.''
   When the drought emergency was declared in March, the reservoirs
were at 55 percent of capacity.
   Two weeks of rain brought levels up to 89.6 percent of capacity,
prompting the state Drought Emergency Task Force to recommend
Monday that water-use restrictions be lifted throughout the state.
   Normally at this time of year the reservoirs are at 100 percent
of capacity.
   ``The recovery made by our reservoirs is nothing short of
amazing,'' Koch said. ``It's the miracle of May.''
   Suburban Westchester County, which gets 85 percent of its water
from the city reservoir system, also announced Monday that
mandatory water restrictions were being eliminated, though
industries were urged to continue conserving water voluntarily.
   The city's restrictions had limited business use of water,
including in air conditioners, and banned the use of water for
lawns, flowers and washing cars, and had also urged personal
conservation.
   ``They are lifted! Go out and shower!'' Koch said.
   A few conservation measures remain in force despite the end of
the drought, said Harvey W. Schultz, commissioner of the city
Department of Environmental Protection.
   Hoses or sprinklers can be used to water lawns and shrubs only
between 7 p.m. and 11 a.m., and water can be served in restaurants
only upon request.

<HEAD>Interest On Short-Term Securities Hits Lowest Level This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell to the lowest level this year in the government's
latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.21 percent Monday, down from 8.41
percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.19 percent, down from 8.39 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.14
percent on Dec. 19 and six-month bills averaged 8.13 percent on
Nov. 28.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.50 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,792.50 and 8.66 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,586.00.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 9.05
percent last week, down from 9.16 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Murdoch's Sky Television Sues Disney Co. for $1.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a clash of entertainment industry giants,
Rupert Murdoch's satellite television company has sued the Walt
Disney Co. for $1.5 billion, claiming Disney backed out of a
landmark pay-TV venture.
   Sky Television, owned by Murdoch's News Corp., alleged in the
suit filed Monday that Disney and several of its subsidiaries
refused to follow terms of a joint venture announced last year to
provide two subscription satellite television services to Britain
and Ireland.
   The first of several satellite-to-home television services
expected in the United Kingdom in coming years, the international
venture was to have been up and running this month or in June.
   But the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, maintains
that Disney has failed to start up the service as agreed. The court
action also alleges that Disney refused to reimburse Sky's costs
and that Disney has threatened to withdraw from the agreement if
not granted more favorable financial terms.
   The suit asks for $500 million in general damages and $1 billion
in punitive damages. It further requests that Disney be prevented
from signing a new agreement with another television subscription
service in the United Kingdom.
   Tom Deegan, Disney's director of corporate communications, would
not comment on the specifics of the suit.
   ``We have great regard for Mr. Murdoch and the accomplishments
of his organizations,'' Deegan said. ``But we are surprised at this
suit which has absolutely no merit.''
   Under the original agreement, announced in a splashy news
conference last November, viewers in Britain and Ireland with
satellite dishes were to receive News Corp.'s Sky Movies, a new
feature film and entertainment service, and the Disney Channel on
two separate channels.
   Both companies declined to say how much they were investing in
the deal.
   Disney was to have supplied 18 hours of daily programming, with
children's shows in the day and family entertainment and mainstream
programs at night. Sky Movies, started earlier this year, features
movies from 20th Century Fox, another of Murdoch's News Corp.'s
subsidiaries.
   The venture was to have given Disney a foothold in a new market
as it expands globally, including the planned 1992 opening of a
European Disneyland near Paris. Sky Television was to have
benefited from the name-brand recognition of a family-oriented
production company.
   The two pay channels were to be sold as a package, with
subscribers charged a monthly fee of about $22 for the service.
Subscribers also needed to purchase or rent a satellite decoding
device.
   News Corp. chief executive Murdoch said at the venture's launch
that he hoped 1 million satellite dishes would be in use in Britain
and Ireland by early 1990, and that he expected the pay service to
become profitable within two to three years.
   Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Corp., while hardly a rival for the
three U.S. television networks, has enjoyed some steady audience
growth in recent months. The Disney Channel, a domestic pay
television service, now claims more than 4 million U.S. subscribers.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Down For Third Straight Month In April</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with seven grafs to UPDATE with Commerce Department report
on April housing starts. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, Advancing issues ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction declined 2.7 percent in April to the lowest
level in more than six years, reflecting the upward trend in
interest rates, the government reported today.
   Last month's drop marked the first time housing construction had
fallen for three consecutive months since the pace of activity
slowed for five months in a row from February through June 1987,
according to the Commerce Department.
   Housing construction was off 4.5 percent in March and 12.7
percent in February.
   New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.36 million units in April, the slowest pace since
the 1.30 million pace of December 1982.
   The housing industry has been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit as interest rates have edged upward over the past year.
   On Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. industry
operated at 83.9 percent of capacity in April, a slight increase
from the month before but still below the threshhold that leads to
bottlenecks and rising prices.
   The report, however, did not hinder the stock market rally. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 24.19 points to
2,463.89 after its big 56.82-point jump Friday, reaching another
post-crash high.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
927 up, 576 down and 491 unchanged.
   Government bond prices slipped after Friday's powerful surge,
but corporate and municipal bond prices finished slightly higher.
   The news on factory use was seen as less significant for the
economy than Friday's report that wholesale prices had risen 0.4
percent in April, less than expected by many economists.
   Federal Reserve policymakers are likely to pause in their
campaign to cure inflation with higher interest rates as they wait
to see whether recent signs of an economic slowdown persist,
economists said Monday.
   Fed policymakers will be sifting through the economic evidence
today when they meet behind closed doors to set monetary policy
through June. The 12-member Federal Open Market Committee,
comprised of the seven Federal Reserve Board members and five
regional Fed bank presidents, meets eight times a year to set
interest rate policy and money growth targets.
   Although the Federal Reserve Board's factory use report Monday
showed industry using more of its capacity last month, it revised
its figures for the first three months of the year to show less
activity than previously reported.
   ``This fits in with the general pattern of slowness,'' said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America.
   The capacity rate hit its most recent peak of 84.3 percent in
December _ a 10-year high. The rate held steady in January and
slipped in both February and March.
   ``The report shows relatively sluggish growth, but continued
growth,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw-Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. ``That's what you want to see at
this stage of the (business) cycle.''
   Economists had been concerned that the steady upward march of
the rate through last year signaled intensified inflationary
pressures.
   As operating rates near full capacity, factories find it
difficult to produce enough to meet demand. That, in turn, can lead
to shortages and price increases.
   In a second report Monday, the Federal Reserve said the pace of
industrial production rose 0.4 percent in April after holding
steady in March and falling 0.3 percent in February, the first
decline in a year.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has been offered an
incentive package worth more than $100 million to keep its
Merchandise Group in Chicago, but $72 million more may be needed to
convince the retailing giant to stay, according to a published
report today.
   The Chicago Sun-Times quotes unidentified sources as saying the
city and state offered Sears a 12-year, $40 million property tax
abatement and an agreement to designate a relocation site at O'Hare
International Airport as an Illinois enterprise zone.
   The incentive package also includes $16 million in
transportation improvements, 80 acres of virtually free land valued
at $48 million, and $10 million in investment tax credits and other
tax breaks, the newspaper reported.
   But the newspaper reported that an official familiar with the
negotiations between Sears and government officials said the
present O'Hare offer is not enough to prevent the state's largest
private employer from moving the Merchandise Group _ involving
6,700 jobs _ to the Sun Belt.
   The deal may have to be sweetened by up to $72 million more, the
newspaper said.
   Sources said the city has offered to lease Sears 80 acres at the
airport site for $10 a year for 99 years, the newspaper said.
   But the city has demanded that the retailer pay ``market value''
_ or about $72 million _ for 140 acres adjacent to the O'Hare site
that Sears wants to develop for other purposes, the newspaper said.
   A government source said the city must discount the cost of the
140 acres sharply to ``keep the Chicago site alive.''
   The official said other states have offered Sears up to 400
acres of free airport land plus lucrative tax breaks and employee
training.
   Last winter, the company announced a restructuring plan that
would relocate the Merchandise Group from the Sears Tower and put
the world's tallest building up for sale.
   It has been reported that Sears has been eyeing sites in
Charlotte, N.C.; Denver, Dallas and elsewhere for its merchandising
center. A final decision has been promised next month.
   Jay Hedges, executive director of the Illinois Department of
Commerce and Community Affairs, refused to discuss specifics of the
offer laid out to Sears last week by Gov. James R. Thompson and
Mayor Richard M. Daley.
   ``The ball is clearly in Sears' court,'' Hedges said. ``It's up
to them to come back to us and tell us what it would take to strike
an agreement.''
   Thompson expressed optimism Monday that Sears would keep the
Merchandise Group in Chicago. He said the city and state were
offering the retailer ``the largest incentive package we have ever
put together to retain a company.''
   Neither John Parsons, the Sears official in charge of the move,
nor John Schmidt, Daley's acting chief of staff, would comment on
negotiations.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival publishers Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell
said Tuesday they have agreed to link their satellite and cable
television operations in a five-year deal worth ``several
millions'' of dollars.
   The agreement means Maxwell Cable TV (MCTV) will carry all five
of Murdoch's Sky Television channels to cable subscribers.
   One of Murdoch's channels, the general entertainment Sky
Channel, is already available on cable. To view the remaining four,
Britons must purchase home receiving dishes.
   Maxwell said it cost the satellite company ``several millions''
to gain access to his cable customers. The agreement takes effect
June 1.
   Sky Television began bouncing signals off the Astra satellite in
February, bringing the first direct satellite-to-home television
signals to Britain. Potential customers have been discouraged from
subscribing to the service because of a shortage of receiving
dishes.
   A government-approved consortium, British Satellite
Broadcasting, begins broadcasting this fall, bouncing signals off
three of the five satellite channels allocated to Britain under
international treaty.
   ``It means an immediate addition of over 50,000 homes for Sky
Television,'' said Andrew Neil, editor of Murdoch's Sunday Times
newspaper and executive chairman of Sky Television.
   ``There is a potential for us to reach a million homes of people
who won't have to buy dishes, often living in areas where you
couldn't get a dish because they live in high rise blocks,
apartments and so on.''
   Only three of London's 32 boroughs, plus a handful of other
regions in Britain, are wired to receive cable. The Cable
Television Association says there are about 270,000 subscribers,
only 18.8 percent of homes capable of receiving it.
   MCTV, the largest cable operator in Britain, collects satellite
signals at its central receiving dish and relays them by cable to
50,000 subscribers.

   City Health Commissioner Dian Sharma, 41, suffered a broken
right arm and had five front teeth shattered after she said a car
ran her off the road Friday.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported today that she had to visit
three hospitals for her medical emergency. One hospital turned down
her insurance and another couldn't provide the proper care.
   Sharma underwent several hours of dental surgery Saturday and
was scheduled for surgery on her right arm today.
   Sharma's first stop after the accident was St. John's Mercy
Hospital, where she was given a pain-killer and examined by an
orthopedist, who determined the fracture needed specialized care.
She was referred to St. Louis University Hospital, but when she got
there after an hour's drive, she learned that her city-paid
insurance program, Group Health Plan, would not pay for treatment
of her injuries.
   ``After about a half-hour, they said, `We can't see you here.
Group Health Plan won't authorize us to set your arm because you
are not 65,''' Sharma said Monday.
   ``I said, `Gee, this is the first time I ever wished I was old,'
'' Sharma said.
   Sharma's injuries were finally treated at Deaconess Hospital,
four hours after the accident.
   Dr. Lawrence Lewis, director of emergency care at St. Louis
University Hospital, said the complexity of new insurance rules
made it difficult for patients and hospitals to know which medical
care is covered and which hospitals are authorized to provide it.
   If this could happen to someone ``as sophisticated in the health
care system as she, this could obviously happen to anyone,''
Lawrence said. ``I don't blame Dian Sharma for being upset.''

   A teachers' strike crippling the nation's
second-largest school district entered its second day today with
more than 20,000 teachers exchanging classes for picket lines five
weeks before the end of the school year.
   Although the school board met in a seven-hour session that
lasted into late Monday and both sides held informal talks, the
teachers set up picket lines again this morning.
   ``We've been on the brink of settlement before,'' Catherine
Carey, spokeswoman for the United Teachers-Los Angeles union, said
Monday night. ``We're cautiously optimistic because lines of
communication are open and we're anxious to settle.
   ``However, we expect we're going to be on a full blown strike.''
   School Board President Roberta Weintraub said the seven-member
board would meet again today.
   ``I'm hopeful that it won't go more than two or three days,''
union president Wayne Johnson said of the strike. ``There's still a
possibility that might happen, but that depends on the board.''
   The union represents 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers,
nurses and counselors. Johnson, who joined striking teachers at
Hamilton High School, said more informal talks would take place,
but no formal negotiations had been set.
   The union claimed that 25,000 teachers did not show up for work
Monday, 4,000 more than the district's estimate.
   Monday morning attendance showed that 430,000 of the 590,000
students were in class but hundreds left junior and senior high
school campuses after becoming bored. School officials said they
would not be punished for truancy.
   ``All we're gonna do is sit and vegetate,'' complained Maureen
Lim, 15, a Hamilton High freshman.
   The schools were being overseen by 12,650 substitute teachers,
aides and administrators. The board had increased substitute
teacher's pay to $165, up from $137.
   It was the first strike since 1970 for the 600-school Los
Angeles Unified School District.
   A so-called ``fact-finder'' from the state was to present a
report Wednesday regarding the unsuccessful 16-month contract
negotiation.
   The teachers are demanding a two-year 21 percent pay increase,
relief from unpaid duties such as playground patrol, and greater
control in choosing curricula.
   The district most recently offered a 21.5 percent pay increase
over three years. It also has offered to set up councils at
individual schools so that teachers would have greater input in
setting curriculum. Teacher governance systems already are
established in Dade County, Fla., Chicago, and Rochester, N.Y.,
schools.
   California schools chief William Honig accused the teachers
union of using grades to pressure a settlement.
   The strike deadline was pushed up two weeks, from May 30 to May
15, when Superintendent Leonard Britton refused to authorize pay
for teachers who failed to turn in final grades.
   Teachers in the district annually earn from $23,440 in beginning
salary to $43,319 for those with doctorates, 98 extra course units
and 19 years' experience.
   Administrators' salaries start at $37,000 for program
coordinators and $95,600 for associate superintendents. Britton
earns $141,000.

<HEAD>Control Data, Cray to Combine Marketing Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc. will sell its
supercomputers to customers of Control Data Corp., which dumped its
own supercomputer business a month ago, the companies announced
today.
   The joint marketing agreement also will allow the corporate
neighbors to explore possible product links between Control Data's
Cyber mainframes and Cray's supercomputers.
   ``The objective is to offer a seamless network of computing
power, including supercomputers, mainframes, information servers,
network servers and work stations,'' the two Twin Cities companies
said in a news release.
   Control Data closed its ETA supercomputer subsidiary April 17,
saying it could not afford to continue funding the money-loser,
which was competing with industry leader Cray.
   How much money Control Data will receive for selling Cray's
machines is not known, said Thomas Charland, a Control Data
spokesman. He said there are no plans for Cray to take a stake in
Control Data as part of the deal.
   ``It's strictly a joint marketing arrangement,'' Charland said.
   James Ousley, Control Data's Computer Products Group president,
said the arrangement will help solve the ``future supercomputing
requirements'' of Control Data customers.
   When ETA, based in St. Paul, Minn., was shut down, 3,100 people
lost jobs. Control Data Chairman Robert Price has said the
supercomputer venture was too expensive. It ate up at least $238
million over its approximately six-year lifespan when Control Data
was having trouble paying its short-term bank loans. The shutdown
will cost the company about $350 million and result in a huge
operating loss for the second quarter in which additional
write-downs of $140 million will occur, Price said.
   Meanwhile, the expense and risk of a supercomputer design
project by Cray founder Seymour Cray has been cited by analysts as
one reason Cray announced Monday that it would split into two
companies. Seymour Cray and his 200-member staff in Colorado
Springs, Colo., will form a new company in which Cray Research Inc.
will hold a 10 percent stake, the company announced.
   Seymour Cray's company will continue to develop the Cray-3,
which he says will be the fastest supercomputer in the world. Cray
Research will concentrate on its bread-and-butter machines, the
Y-MP and its successors.
   Ousley said Bloomington-based Control Data and Minneapolis-based
Cray already have strong product ties in several areas. Control
Data's Cyber work stations are compatible with Cray supercomputers;
and Cray also uses disk products from Imprimis, a Control Data
subsidiary.

   The stock market moved lower early today amid
selling to collect profits amassed during the past two strong
sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 9.71 at 2,454.18
in the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the tally of New

   Volume on the Big Board came to 64.63 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Besides the profit-motivated selling, analysts attributed the
downturn to renewed doubts about the economic outlook and about the
ability of companies to maintain profit growth if the economy
stalls.
   Federal Reserve policy makers meeting today have abundant
evidence of slower economic growth to sift through as they plot
their monetary policy course for the next six weeks.
   A report from a real estate trade group today said rising
mortgage rates hit home sales and prices hard in expensive

at 10~.
   Occidental Petroleum, the second most heavily traded stock, was
up } at 28.
   International Business Machines, which announced a new push into

<HEAD>Survey Says Americans Worried About Paying The Mortgage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paying the mortgage has replaced writing checks
for the monthly bills as the main financial worry of Americans,
according to a new study.
   In a survey of 1,000 U.S. households conducted for the
International Association for Financial Planning, 19 percent listed
``payments on the house'' among their two or three biggest
financial concerns, making it the most frequent response in the
study.
   In an IAFP survey last year, house payments ranked third at 9
percent, behind monthly bills and taxes, the organization said.
   In a related survey of 300 households with income of $50,000 or
more, house payments also ranked No. 1 at 21 percent, according to
the report.
   The survey on financial attitudes was conducted for the IAFP by
The Gallup Organization. The results were released Monday in
Atlanta.
   The survey also found that 25 percent of the respondents did not
have plans for retirement. Of those that did have plans, the
largest percentage _ 35 percent _ intended to rely on employee
retirement programs.
   Forty-three percent of the respondents said they are concerned
about outliving their retirement money, a drop from 49 percent last
year.
   ``Survey data indicates Americans have been distracted from this
long-term financial worry by near-term mortgage woes,'' the IAFP
said.

   What will Western Europe be like when the

reports looking ahead to 1992, when the barriers come down.

   Citizens can now buy a Europillow,
emblazoned with a circle of 12 gold stars on royal blue, but
founding fathers are tossing fitfully over their dream of a single
Europe.
   Halfway between the Single European Act of 1986 and the target
date of Jan. 1, 1993, European Economic Community officials insist
they can blur internal borders enough to forge economic union.
   But few people are talking about a United States of Europe, in
sharp contrast to the first days of Europhoria.
   In full flower, the dream was to spring beyond economics to a
blend of social philosophy, public policy and shared culture that
created a new extranational being, the European.
   Reality has muscled aside rhetoric.
   At Cafe des Amis in London, on the surface a sign of cultural
shift, a French waiter was asked what coffee he had. ``Espresso,
cappuccino and,'' he concluded with a sharp sniff, ``English soup.''
   Early this year, the EEC Commission president, Jacques Delors,
exhorted the European Parliament: ``We must give this community
more flesh and _ why not? _ a measure of soul.''
   But he has toned down the enthusiasm that prompted Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain to remind him, in a stinging
speech, that concepts like ``social gains'' were not on the table.
   ``There is no question of a new personality replacing individual
cultures,'' said Pascal Lamy, chief aide to Delors.
   Three-quarters of Britons and Italians speak no second tongue,
EEC figures show. Community business is done in nine languages. In
most of the 12 countries, the predominant second culture is
American.
   The process was never supposed to be quick, but officials now
talk in terms of generations. Lord Young, British secretary of
state for trade and industry, suggests 500 years.
   Even such tangible second-stage aspects as a harmonized foreign
policy seem beyond reach in light of acrimony over the fundamentals
of national currencies, border controls and tax policies.
   Britain recently bounced back Delors' plan for a monetary union
to take measured steps toward a common currency.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government also rejected talk of
uniform workers' rights and labor practices, calling that a
throwback to the 1970s.
   But President Francois Mitterrand of France, a Socialist,
earlier this year defined ``backward'' as refusing to protect wages
and workers.
   ``The most regressive and unjust laws must not prevail,'' he
told a crowd. ``France will not give its consent.''
   Out of the public eye, officials struggle to balance sales taxes
which now vary from 0 to 38 percent, a prerequisite to open borders.
   An even greater obstacle to free movement are concerns for
security, especially in Britain and France where authorities watch
closely for possible terrorists or drug runners.
   ``The last time I went through British customs they took my car
apart like a bloody Lego toy,'' observed Val Gardner, a British
motor engineer living in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. `'That is
not likely to change.''
   Few leaders are prepared to entrust security to any form of EEC
police force, which, in any case, could not be established without
complex new jurisdictional accords.
   Enthusiasm is mixed for the basic idea among EEC members, and
each is coolly assessing what it stands to lose. Every politician
knows, whatever his stance in Brussels, he faces voters at home.
   A museum tour of any European capital shows the vast cultural
wealth behind the dream, a shared sense of pride in the art,
literature and music which shaped the Western world.
   But a glance at the daily headlines suggests that a millenium of
conflict has merely been refined by modern times.
   In April, for example, the annual French yacht race across the
Atlantic was stalled by fishermen in the port of Lorient demanding
that a warship chase off an interloping Spanish fleet.
   The Greens, a loose amalgam of European ecologist parties, are
gaining fast on platforms that argue the single market will smash
flat all the bumps and edges that make up European life.
   They warn that small farmers and businessmen will perish if they
cling to traditional ways _ or even if they try to keep up, in many
cases.
   ``They tell us we will gain 5 million jobs, but we'll lose 20
million,'' German candidate Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf
told the Greens' congress in Paris to a tumult of applause.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade in dealings influenced by
optimistic forecasts of precipitation in most crop areas.
   Wheat prices were down amid reports of rain in Kansas, where the
winter crop has sustained major damage because of hot, dry
conditions.
   Soybean prices were forced down by National Weather Service
forecasts of rain for some of the drier growing areas.
   Corn futures also were pressured by the weather service's 6- to
10-day forecast for increased precipitation. However, corn prices
may be helped by the Agriculture Department's announcement
yesterday that the Soviet Union has purchased 450-thousand metric
tons of corn.
   In early trading, corn was 3 cents to 4{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at 2.77} a bushel; wheat was 7\ cents
to 11 cents lower with May at $4.07 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents
to 10 cents lower with May at $7.42 a bushel; oats were 4} cents to
6{ cents lower with May at $1.84 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
71.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with May at 77.20 cents a pound; hogs were .42 cent lower to
.02 cent higher with June at 48.42 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.10 cents to 1.37 cents lower with May at 34.65 cents

   Livestock futures settled mixed Monday, while pork futures were

   In Brussels, Belgian capital and EEC headquarters site, such
pessimism is shrugged away.
   ``That assumes labor is a single ball that cannot be shaped in
other ways,'' said Geoffrey Fitchew, EEC director-general for
financial institutions, who predicted incalcuble new opportunities.
   The questio, he acknowledged, was how much sacrifice individuals
and national governments were willing to make during the inevitable
shakedown period.
   Some signs are ominous. In France's Perigueux, young farmers
protesting EEC price levels bricked up the local prefecture,
labeling their concrete barrier ``The Wall of Rural Rage.''
   The trend toward fast, big and uniform is clear. Last year,
takeover prices in Western European corporate mergers came to $70
billion.
   Mass marketing means little unsettling changes. As it stands,
for example, rules sound the death knell for the pink dye in the
sausages vital to a proper English breakfast, or to Danish hotdogs.
   Even in Spain and Portugal, where eagerness is palpable across a
broad sweep of society, many people fear a tide of northern
Europeans and their money will wash over what is left of cherished
old ways.
   Already, a powerful lobby in the European Parliament, an arm of
the EEC, is seeking to ban bullfighting.
   West Germans, who have cut unemployment to below 8 percent, fret
at a Spanish jobless rate approaching 20 percent. After 1992, the
community's 15.5 million unemployed could pitch up anywhere.
   German opinion polls indicate a steadily growing skepticism over
rushing into a single Europe.
   In France, where Delors is from, authorities pushed hard for a
single Europe, which originally was the dream of Frenchmen Jean
Monnet. But, more than most EEC citizens, the French worry out loud.
   A recent poll for the daily Le Monde showed only 30 percent of
Frenchmen queried felt building Europe was a crucial priority, a
drop from 43 percent when the idea was first debated in 1984.
   In a briskly selling book called ``La Grande Illusion,'' the
French financier-philosopher Alain Minc dismissed the whole idea as
a ``a Darwinian nightmare.''
   He warns of a wave of xenophobia and extreme nationalism across
Europe as aggrieved sectors feel the pinch.
   Almost every day, some French publication points out that after
1992, any Danish dentist or Belgium barber who has seen a Cezanne
can set up shop in Provence.
   Jacques Chirac, Paris' mayor and a former premier, said a single
Europe was essential, but he warned France would suffer until it
retooled its industries and services to be more competitive.
   He warned that a real estate boom would drive rents out of reach
for Frenchmen whose earnings lag behind those of richer EEC
neighbors.
   ``I am convinced Paris will be the capital of Europe, the
gateway, for its location, communications and other attributes,''
said Chirac, tempering pride with trepidation.
   Europe's capital now is Brussels, home to 13,000 EEC officials
and employees, although the European Parliament still meets in
Strasbourg and some administration is done in Luxembourg.
   The old Belgian city is an apt microcosm of a future single
Europe.
   Brussels residents are split between the little nation's two
official languages, which are a source of occasionally violent
conflict along the borders between Wallony and Flanders.
   The EEC's glass-paneled Berlaymont building, rising above the
snapping colors of 12 separate states and their common standard of
stars on blue, symbolizes the grand dream.
   But most visitors prefer the Grand Place, a timeworn square
lined with elaborate Renaissance office-mansions that housed guilds
of fiercely independent craftsmen who did things the old way.
   Brussels receives television broadcasts from seven countries.
And viewers cringe when a British Broadcasting Corp. newscaster
says a British Cabinet minister is ``going to Europe.''
   In the spirit of things, the telephone book is thick with
private businesses that prefix their name with ``Euro.'' One sells
48 kinds of Eurokitsch, including jogging pants and pillows.
   Another, a sandblasting company, draws chuckles from those who
have grown dubious of the dream: Eurofacade.

   Makers of a denture cleanser and a wood cleaner
good enough to make a church sparkle risked the wrath of abortion
critics and advertised on the NBC movie ``Roe Vs. Wade.''
   A spot check of network affiliates, however, reported only a
modest number of telephone calls during and immediately after
Monday night's broadcast, and the majority of those favored the
broadcast.
   The movie won the ratings battle Monday night, according to
figures from the nation's 20 largest television markets.
   ``Roe Vs. Wade'' had a rating of 16.8 and a 26 share, according
to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ABC's ``B.L. Stryker,'' a crime drama
starring Burt Reynolds, and CBS' lineup of comedies had about an 18
share.
   The rating is the show's percentage of the total homes with
televisions in the markets surveyed. The share is the show's
percentage of sets actually in use.
   Commercials that showed Polident doing its stuff on stained
dentures and Murphy's Oil Soap brightening church pews and aisles
appeared along with ads for perfume, spring water and wine,
anti-itch medicine, fast cars and first-run movies.
   NBC had to cut the prices for some of the commercials in the
two-hour movie but said it found paying customers for all 14
minutes of advertising time.
   The movie starred Holly Hunter as a character based on Norma
McCorvey, the then-anonymous ``Jane Roe'' plaintiff who sued the
Dallas District Attorney, Henry Wade, in an abortion case that went
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The movie was about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed in
the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision, but also portrayed
sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the other side.
   The National Right to Life Committee urged NBC affiliates not to
run the movie while the American Family Association, a
Mississippi-based religious group, encouraged advertisers not to
buy time on the program. Both claimed the movie took a pro-abortion
stance.
   In a letter earlier this month, NBC President Robert Wright told
the 100 biggest national advertisers that the movie presented a
balanced view of the abortion issue and he would run it even if no
advertisers bought time.
   Only one of NBC's 208 affiliates had notified the network that
it intended to pre-empt the movie, spokesman Curt Block said
Monday. The exception was the affiliate in Kansas City, which was
committed to a baseball game. NBC found another station in the
market to run the movie, he said.
   Block admitted the network cut its normal advertising rate
during the past four or five days to find paid sponsors, but he
declined to say how much time was sold at a discount or how deep
the discounts were.
   One ad agency media expert, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said rates were cut as much as half for about 4{ minutes of
commercials.
   Industry sources say the going rate for a 30-second commercial
in that time period is about $180,000.
   Block said the movie probably will lose money but he was unable
to confirm a published report that placed the anticipated loss at
about $1 million.
   Networks usually don't have to discount prices for commercials
in prime time, Block said. If a network fails to find paying
sponsors, it will often fill the time with public service
announcements run for free.
   Block said that calls to the NBC switchboard in New York ran 163
to 22 in favor of showing the movie during the two hours the
program was on and the 15 minutes afterward.
   ``Less than 200 calls isn't that much, but it is unusual to have
an eight to one ratio praising a product. People are more apt to
voice their complaints rather to praise. We are pleased with it,''
he said.
   At KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, a switchboard operator reported 40
calls in favor of the show and five against between 9:45 p.m. and
11 p.m. PDT.
   KNSD-TV in San Diego received nearly 50 calls and a majority
favored the broadcast, assignment editor Paul Levikow said.
   ``It was not the type of response we expected,'' he said. The
station received more calls when it interrupted the movie ``Top
Gun'' with a commercial, he said.
   The uproar over ``Roe Vs. Wade'' is the latest in a series of
television programs triggering protests in recent months by
individuals and groups who claim the programs are morally
objectionable. Among them have been NBC's ``Saturday Night Live''
comedy show and Fox Television's situation comedy, ``Married ...
with Children.''

   The U.S. Treasury is losing billions of
dollars because employers _ including the government itself _ fail
to withhold taxes from the paychecks of workers who are erroneously
designated as ``independent contractors,'' the General Accounting
Office said today.
   GAO placed a good share of the blame on Congress, which, in an
effort 10 years ago to curtail the Internal Revenue Service, made
it more difficult to crack down on employers who violate the
withholding provisions.
   Paul L. Posner, a GAO associate director, told a House
Government Operations subcommittee that the failure of workers
designated as independent contractors to report some or all their
income is at the root of the revenue loss.
   In turn, GAO found, employers are not complying with
requirements that they file reports with the IRS on payments made
to individual contractors. Even when auditing business tax returns,
the report said, the IRS is not identifying businesses that fail to
file such reports.
   ``The importance of employers filing required information
returns on payments made to independent contractors cannot be
overemphasized,'' Posner said. ``IRS officials estimate that
billions in taxes are lost because independent contractors do not
report all income.''
   Posner told the subcommittee on consumer affairs that in 1984
alone, the IRS estimated it lost $1.6 billion because about one of
every seven employers misidentified employees as independent
contractors.
   Michael J. Murphy, the acting IRS commissioner, said the agency
shares concern about such non-compliance and has taken several
steps to combat it. He added, ``The current rules are confusing to
employers and difficult for IRS to administer.''
   Independent contractors are companies or individuals who supply
services to a business or government agency but do not have an
employee relationship with the business or agency. There are
numerous tests to determine whether a worker is an employee or
independent contractor, including who controls working hours.
   If a supplier is classified as an employee, a business must
withhold income and Social Security taxes from his or her paycheck
and pay an employer's share of Social Security taxes.
   However, if that supplier is said to be an independent
contractor, the business withholds no tax and pays no employer's
share of Social Security tax. The Treasury loses again when the
contractor claims business deductions.
   The law requires that payments for services supplied by
independent contractors that are partnerships or sole
proprietorships be reported to the IRS, but not those supplied by
corporations.
   The independent-contractor issue is not new. The IRS has been
battling in the courts for years in an effort to require sellers of
goods and services, such as some distributors of Amway products, to
pay taxes as employees.
   The bulk of the report from GAO, an arm of Congress, focused on
the failure of government agencies to file IRS reports on payments
to independent contractors.
   The report cited a finding by the Treasury Department that 12 of
14 federal agencies surveyed failed to report $9 billion in
payments to independent contractors in 1984 and 1985. GAO conducted
its own spot survey of state and local governments, and found 16 of
17 state agencies checked and 7 of 10 local units were not in full
compliance.
   ``In reviewing $9 million in payments to independent contractors
(by the sampled government units) that were subject to information
reporting, we found that $8 million had not been reported,'' Posner
said.
   Many state and local officials did not fully understand the
reporting requirements, and IRS has not done enough to clear up the
confusion, GAO concluded.
   GAO spot-checked business tax returns that had been audited by
the IRS and found that in 50 percent of the cases, at least one
information return was missing. Furthermore, the report stated, IRS
auditors failed to detect the missing returns, which involved
payments of $6 million to independent contractors.
   IRS officials say they already are taking steps to correct such
deficiencies. But it will take action by Congress to correct a 1978
law restricting the authority of the IRS to reclassify workers who
have been identified by employers as independent contractors, GAO
said.

<HEAD>SEC Charges Insider Trading Ring In Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
insider trading charges today against a 24-year-old former
paralegal and five others who allegedly made more than $800,000
from her tip about a leveraged buyout of a department store chain.
   The SEC alleged that the paralegal, Kerry A. Hurton, learned
from confidential documents that Hooker Corporation Ltd. planned to
announce a proposed buyout of Birmingham, Ala.-based Parisian Inc.
in July 1987.
   Ms. Hurton worked in the Boston office of the major New York law
firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
   She allegedly passed information to her boyfriend, Eric Laboz of
New York City, and directly or indirectly to several other people
who made a total of $823,825 in profits by trading in Parisian
stock, the SEC said.
   One of the alleged illegal traders is a deputy U.S. marshal,
Bernard Stone of Norwell.
   The civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston,
seeks to force the defendants to return the alleged profits and pay
up to three times the amount in penalties.
   According to the complaint, the defendants directly or
indirectly caused the purchase of 65,020 shares of Parisian stock
at an average price of about $18 a share in June and July 1987,
shortly before the proposed buyout.
   After the buyout was announced, Parisian stock rose to about $30
a share, the SEC said.
   Hooker, an Australian real estate and retailing company,
completed the acquisition of Parisian for $30.65 a share, or a
total of about $230 million, in April 1988. Parisian is a fashion
retailer with 16 stores in Alabama, Texas, Georgia and Florida.
   Skadden, Arps did not immediately a telephone call seeking
comment on the case. Ms. Hurton no longer works for the firm.
   Besides Ms. Hurton, Laboz and Stone, the defendants named in the
complaint are Jonathan R. Beck of North Hills, N.Y.; Bruce E.
Maurice of Danvers; and Sheldon M. Stone of Marblehead.
   The charges result from a one-year investigation that began
after the SEC ``was alerted by a private individual'' to the
possible illegal activity, said John Sturc, the agency's associate
director for enforcement in Washington.

   Massachusetts plans to use undercover agents,
aerial surveillance and search warrants in a pollution crackdown
environmentalists and state officials today predicted will be the
broadest in the country.
   Escorted by dozens of uniformed enforcement officers, Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis today stood between the shore of the Charles
River and a new jail to underscore Massachusett's desire to hit
polluters with criminal penalties.
   ``These are violent crimes. They do violence against others,
against houses, against neighborhoods and against the water we
drink and the air we breathe,'' Dukakis said.
   A 33-member strike force of lawyers, scientists and police
officers will be used to find polluters and build cases against
them.
   Dukakis was joined by Attorney General James Shannon and the
state's entire environmental establishment, but not by federal
officials. Dukakis aides said, however, that they plan to
coordinate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
local U.S. attorney.
   ``The state is thinking big and thinking properly,'' said Elissa
Parker, policy director at the Environmental Law Institute in
Washington.
   She said Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania have strike forces that
concentrate on toxic dumping and water pollution while
Massachusetts will include the protection of wetlands and other
habitats.
   Except for those three states, ``there aren't any statewide
initiatives that even come close to what Massachusetts is doing,''
she said.
   ``A lot of people viewed previous environmental enforcement as
an acceptable risk of doing business _ you could live with civil
penalties and a slap on the wrist,'' Shannon said.
   ``We're saying, `If you violate these laws, you run the risk of
criminal prosecution, a prison sentence and damn heavy fines.'''
   Daniel Greenbaum, who heads the state Department of
Environmental Quality Engineering, said up to 50 percent of people
discharging pollutants into sewers or the air do not have required
permits, and many who have permits violate them.
   State Secretary of Environmental Affairs John DeVillars said
polluters have ruined 103 water supplies in the state, created more
than 1,000 toxic dumps and cost the state $90 million a year in
losses from contaminated shellfish beds.
   He said state laws generally are tough enough, but have not been
enforced adequately. He also said Dukakis will file legislation
this year for tougher penalties.
   But Joseph Duggan of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce said
that the strike force is ``all stick and no carrot.''
   ``People who are intentionally disobeying the law, fouling the
land and atmosphere, should be cracked down on and made to pay,''
he said.
   But others find out after buying property that it was
contaminated and are told, ```You're responsible: Clear it up.' We
are objecting to that. We don't think it's the right approach,'' he
said.
   The environment became a focal point in last year's presidential
campaign when then-Vice President George Bush toured Boston Harbor
to criticize Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, for delaying a
cleanup of the harbor.

<HEAD>Study Says California will Keep On Growing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All regions of California will post
population gains of more than 20 percent by the year 2000 and
Sacramento will be the fastest growing area, according to a new
study.
   The study released on Tuesday by the Center for Continuing Study
of the California Economy said the state's population will add
nearly 6 million people in the next decade to reach 35 million by
2000.
   San Diego will be the state's second fastest growing region
while the Los Angeles Basin will add nearly 3 million residents.
The San Francisco Bay area will grow by around a million.
   The forecast was higher than those by most state and regional
agencies. The study by the center projected a statewide population
more than 2 million higher than the state Department of Finance.
   ``Slow growth is not realistic,'' said Stephen Levy, the
center's director. ``The choices are either planned growth or
unplanned growth so we need to stop wishing and start preparing.''
   The study said foreign immigration plays a key role in the
state's growth with nearly 1 in 2 new residents a recent immigrant.
The center predicted the trend will continue with the addition of
more than 250,000 foreign immigrants each year.
   ``In 1988 ethnic minorities accounted for 40 percent of the
state's residents,'' the study said. ``By 2000 the share will be
nearly 50 percent.''
   The demographics underlying the housing market should remain
strong, the forecast added.
   ``Household growth is projected to range from 190,000 to 275,000
a year, depending on income growth and the behavior of recent
immigrants. Much of the growth wil be in the 35-54 age group which
has the highest income levels.''

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has set up a separate
division for its warehousing and distribution operations, the
company announced.
   Michael Bozic, chairman of the Sears Merchandise Group, said
Monday that the group's distribution network has been will become a
wholly owned division of the Merchandise Group and will be called
Sears Logistics Services Inc.
   Bozic said the move is part of Sears' strategy to improve
efficiency and become more competitive. The company said it needs
better distribution to back up its new retail strategy based on
everyday low prices and more brand-name merchandise.
   Bozic said that at a later date the Terminal Freight Handling
Co., a transportation operation wholly owned by Sears, would be
merged with Sears Logistics Services to create a complete logistics
network under the aegis of the Merchandise Group.
   The latest distribution changes come two years after the
nation's largest retailer first began overhauling its warehousing
system.
   Since then, Sears has shut down five of its 12 major warehouses,
including an 82-year-old facility on Chicago's West Side.

<HEAD>Brewers To Draw Up Own Proposals To Counter Industry Shake-up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British brewers are drawing up their own proposals
to restructure the country's beer industry in an attempt to head
off government-proposed anti-monopoly reforms that would force
brewers to sell up to 22,000 pubs.
   The move by the brewers follows a meeting with Trade and
Industry Secretary Lord Young on Monday, during which he said he
would entertain alternative proposals as long as they remedied what
he calls a ``complex monopoly situation in the supply of beer.''
   Representatives of the Brewers' Society, the major trade group,
are to hold further meetings with Department of Trade and Industry
officials over the next two weeks to present their case.
   ``We are in a state of negotiations with the DTI,'' a society
spokesman said Tuesday. He wasn't identified in accordance with
British custom.
   The debate centers on recommendations made public in March by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission aimed at promoting greater
competition in the way beer is supplied.
   Among the measures proposed was a limit of 2,000 on the number
of public houses, or pubs, that any single brewer could own. If
implemented, this measure could result in the forced sale of up to
22,000 pubs. Young said at the time he was inclined to implement
the commission's proposed reforms.

<TEXT>
   The state Casino Control Commission voted
today for the first time to close a casino, ordering Elsinore's
Atlantis Casino Hotel to shut down Monday.
   The closure, sought by the Division of Gaming Enforcement, was
approved 5-0 after a three-day hearing.
   The Atlantis, which a month ago became the first New Jersey
gaming house denied a license renewal, has been losing money,
adding daily to a multimillion-dollar debt.
   ``The record in this case leads us inexorably to only one
conclusion,'' Commission Chairman Walter Read said. ``The casino
can no longer be operated on a sound and businesslike basis.''
   Conservator Joseph Nolan, appointed last month when the casino's
license expired, had sought permission to stay open at least
through the lucrative Memorial Day weekend.
   The Atlantis was sold last month to New York developer Donald
Trump, who already owns two casinos and one under construction in
Atlantic City. Trump had said that if the deal became final, he
would close the Atlantis' casino and operate it a first-class
hotel. State law bars ownership of more than three casino licenses
in Atlantic City by any one corporation or individual.

   Share prices closed lower Tuesday in light trading
as the market consolidated its strong gains of the past two trading
sessions.
   Players showed little interest in doing business, however, as
they awaited key economic data due out later this week, including
the U.S. trade report on Wednesday and British average earnings
figures on Thursday.
   At the close the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 13.2 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,136.7, just 0.7 point
above its lowest level. At its best, the index was down 2.2 points
shortly after the opening.
   The strong gains on Friday and Monday came on favorable U.S.
producer price figures.
   ``We've just had a bit of a drawing in of breath,'' one London
dealer said. ``We've had a bit of a markdown, a bit of
consolidation, but people haven't wanted to do anything, really.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 11.0 points lower at
1,776.2. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 5.56 points to
close at 1,211.61.
   Volume was thin, as 401.5 million shares changed hands, compared

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penny Co. said Tuesday that its first quarter profit fell 2
percent over a year ago due to costs of discontinuing a television
shopping network, while another large retailer, Dayton Hudson
Corp., posted a 29 percent jump in earnings.
   Penney said net income for the three months ended April 29 was
$128 million, or 97 cents a share, vs. $131 million, or 96 cents,
in the 1988 quarter. Sales totaled $3.34 billion, up 5 percent from
3.17 billion last year.
   Dayton Hudson said it netted $40 million, or 51 cents a share,
in the first quarter on sales of $2.83 billion. That compared with
earnings of $31 million, or 36 cents, and $2.54 billion in sales
last year.
   Dallas-based Penney said its latest results included a $20
million after-tax charge for discontinuing the operations of the
television shopping network Teleaction. Without the charge,
first-quarter earnings would have risen 13 percent, it said.
   Penney also said that revenue from other businesses, including
its life insurance operations, JCP Realty and JCPenney National
Bank, declined mainly because of its decision to leave the casualty
insurance business. It said it was talking to several major
insurance companies about the sale of J.C. Penney Casualty
Insurance Co.
   Dayton Hudson Chairman Kenneth A. Macke attributed the improved
quarterly results at the Minneapolis retailer to strength in the
Mervyn's department store chain and direct sales subsidiary.
   But he said Target's operating profit was below last year's
first quarter due to the opening of 38 new stores, largely in the
Southeast.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment group began a hostile
tender offer for CNW Corp. today worth more than $700 million, but
management of the large Midwest railroad company said it was trying
to assemble a competing bid.
   Chairman Robert Schmiege told about 300 shareholders at CNW's
annual meeting that management was working with financial experts
and an unidentified outside party to devise an offer that would
derail the $44-a-share offer by Japonica Partners, which already
owns about 8.8 percent of CNW's stock.
   ``We are reasonably optimistic we will succeed in this effort,''
Schmiege said.
   CNW is parent of the 6,000-mile Chicago &amp; North Western
Transportation Co., an important freight hauler in the Midwest and
one of the largest freight-hauling railroads in the country. It
also provides passenger service in the Chicago area.
   Japonica's offer was timed to coincide with the annual
shareholders meeting and an effort to oust CNW's board through a
proxy contest.
   The tender offer is to purchase 13.9 million shares of common
stock at $44 a share in cash, or about $612 million, and 2.7
million shares of convertible preferred stock at $34.11 a share in
cash, or about $92 million.
   Japonica said in a statement issued today that it wants to run
CNW's freight operations, but would sell the railroad holding
company's commuter line.
   The offer expires at midnight EDT on June 13, unless extended by
Japonica.
   ``We sincerely believe that our offer and the experience and
competitive culture Japonica Partners will bring to CNW is in the
best interests of the company, its employees, customers and the
communities it serves,'' said the Japonica statement.
   CNW's common stock closed Monday at $43.75 a share, down 87{
cents, in composite trading.
   Japonica said it intends to acquire all of CNW's stock. The
tender offer would potentially give it 90 percent of CNW's common
shares and preferred shares.
   Meanwhile, a Delaware federal court was due to rule today on a
motion by Japonica to delay today's scheduled shareholder vote on
the grounds that CNW had violated proxy solicitation rules. CNW
officials have denied the allegation.
   Japonica, a 1-year-old partnership headed by former Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. vice presidents Paul Kazarian and Michael Lederman,
began courting CNW in March with an unsolicited offer to negotiate
a buyout.
   CNW Chairman Robert Schmiege termed the offer ``nonsense.''
   Since then, Japonica has repeatedly declared its intention to
acquire CNW.
   CNW's board of directors has formed a special committee to
solicit other offers. The company has said it is negotiating with
at least one potential bidder.
   In a statement issued today, CNW said the auction process is
continuing despite Japonica's latest move.
   ``(O)ther potential bidders have already signed confidentiality
agreements and are in discussions with representatives of the
special committee'' set up to consider alternatives to to maximize
stockholder value, the statement said.
   CNW urged stockholders ``to focus on the fact that it remains
important that the special committee of CNW's board of directors
remain in control of the acution process.
   The committee would ``meet promptly'' to consider Japonica's
offer, the CNW statement said.
   In Japonica's statement, the partnership said ``We intend to
manage all the freight operations of CNW ... while working
cooperatively with the employee unions to maintain and improve
operations and service for CNW's customers. The assets we are
considering selling are only those not essential to CNW's freight
business, such as certain real estate, excess equipment, and the
commuter line.''
   Congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission have been
watching Japonica's actions with an eye toward stepping in to
prevent any disruption of rail service.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to forecasts of
rainfall in crop producing states hurt recently by dryness.
   The drop in soybean prices also was attributed to technical
selling and softness in the export market.
   ``Everyone was negative from the start of trading,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   National Weather Service forecasts of rain in the Southern
Plains were augmented by private forecasters who predicted heavy
rains would spread to Kansas and Nebraska and other states in the
upper-Midwest plagued by dry conditions. The forecasts put the
market on the defensive.
   Gidel said soybean futures sell-stops were activated early in
trading, pushing new crop soybean prices below $7 for the first
time in weeks. He said rumors of interest in soy oil by the Soviet
Union had little effect on the market.
   Corn prices were not helped by the Agriculture Department's
announcement Monday that the Soviets would buy 450,000 metric tons
of corn.
   Reports of an above-average yield in the Indiana, Michigan and
Ohio soft red wheat crop caused a selloff in wheat futures, Gidel
said.
   At the close, wheat was 7\ cents to 8{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was 3{ cents
to 5\ cents lower with May at $2.77{ a bushel; oats were 6{ cents
to 7 cents lower with May at $1.84 a bushel; soybeans were 15 cents
to 20\ cents lower with May at $7.33 a bushel.

   The stock market moved lower today amid selling
to collect profits amassed during the previous two strong sessions.
   ``Basically, what we're seeing is a bit of a pullback after two
very strong days,'' said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at
the investment firm Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. ``This is
quite normal. The market took quite a run and needs to pause.''
   The selling, which was spread through most major market sectors,
appeared to be motivated mainly by the desire to collect profits,
he said.
   Market operators decided the time was right to sell because the
government is due to release some potentially market-moving
economic figures on Wednesday and Thursday, said Peter VandenBerg,
a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Selling in front of a couple of closely watched economic
numbers makes sense to me,'' VandenBerg said.
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to report on
the country's merchandise trade performance in March and the
following day the Labor Department is to release its April consumer
price index.
   Meanwhile, analysts said Federal Reserve policy makers meeting
today already have abundant evidence of slower economic growth to
sift through as they plot their monetary policy course for the next
six weeks.
   A Commerce Department report today said housing construction
fell for the third straight month in April. Analysts said the 2.7

<HEAD>Survey: Top Money Worry Among Americans is Paying The Mortgage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Housing Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-term financial anxieties such as retirement
and old-age health care are taking a back seat to immediate worries
about paying the mortgage, a study shows.
   In a survey of 1,000 U.S. households, conducted for the
International Association for Financial Planning, 19 percent listed
``payments on the house'' among their two or three biggest
financial concerns, making it the most frequent response.
   In an IAFP survey last year, the monthly house payments ranked
third in frequency at 9 percent, the organization said, behind
monthly bills and taxes.
   The survey also suggests Americans are worrying less about
inflation, with only 2 percent of the respondents expressing
concern about rising consumer prices. In last year's IAFP survey,
inflation was listed by 9 percent of the respondents.
   ``If you look, their concerns are short- instead of long-term,''
IAFP President Charles Finn said Tuesday.
   Finn said rising interest rates are behind the heightened
concern about mortgage payments.
   ``The force that drives that the most is adjustable rate
mortgages,'' he said. ``I think you'll see that (the concern about
the mortgages) as long as the interest rates are up.''
   The survey, conducted by The Gallup Organization and released
Monday in Atlanta, also included a related study involving 300
households with income of $50,000 or more. In that group, house
payments also ranked No. 1 at 21 percent as a primary worry.
   The survey found that worries about making the mortgage payments
may be leading some people to divert attention from retirement
planning and long-term health care.
   The survey found 25 percent of respondents didn't have plans for
retirement. Of those that did, the largest percentage _ 35 percent
_ intended to rely on employee retirement programs.
   Saving for retirement was listed by only 3 percent of the
respondents, and was ranked next-to-last, above inflation.
   ``Survey data indicates Americans have been distracted from this
long-term financial worry by near-term mortgage woes,'' the survey
said.
   Only one in 10 in the survey said they would use their own
savings or earnings to pay for a family member's long-term health
care.
   If people do not make adequate arrangements for their retirement
or elderly health care, Finn said, they will have to rely on
government social programs.
   ``With the increases in life expectancy and the larger (elderly)
population, this has dramatic implications for the country,'' Finn
said. ``The message we are trying to get across is they should plan
for the future.''
   The IAFP is an Atlanta-based professional organization for the
financial planning industry.
   Gallup conducted the main survey in April using a random sample
described by the IAFP as ``representative of the U.S. as a whole.''
Scott Larsen, an IAFP spokesman, said the survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

<HEAD>Ogilvy Chief Says WPP Buyout Offer Couldn't Be Beaten</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of Ogilvy Group Inc. said Tuesday he
investigated every reasonable alternative but could not find
anything to beat WPP Group PLC's record $864 million buyout offer
for the advertising giant.
   Kenneth Roman, Ogilvy's chairman, said he also was confident
there would be few if any client defections in the wake of the
buyout agreement reached late Monday, under which Ogilvy's board
unanimously approved WPP's proposal for a $54 a share tender offer
for all of Ogilvy's stock.
   Martin Sorrell, chief executive of London-based WPP, said at a
news conference that he intended to keep Ogilvy and its management
intact. As part of the deal, he signed an agreement that guarantees
Ogilvy will be run autonomously.
   The deal, the largest takeover ever in the advertising business,
comes less than two years after WPP broke onto the U.S. advertising
scene with a hostile $566 million buyout of the parent of another
huge ad agency, J. Walter Thompson. The Thompson buyout had been
the previous ad industry record.
   The addition of Ogilvy, the world's fifth-largest advertising
company, to the arsenal at WPP, the third-largest ad concern last
year, creates the world's second largest advertising and marketing
services company. The new company has billings of about $13.5
billion, a shade below industry leader Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC.
   Sorrell had proposed a friendly buyout at $45 a share in late
April, sweetened the proposal to $50 a share early last week and
boosted it to $54 a share this past weekend.
   The Ogilvy board approved the latest offer late Monday night,
the two sides announced early Tuesday. Roman and Sorrell appeared
together at a midmorning news conference to discuss the deal and
Roman later presided at the previously-scheduled Ogilvy annual
shareholders meeting.
   Sorrell said Ogilvy fit his plan to build WPP into a group of
quality name brands. ``We are not the largest nor do we want to
be,'' he said.
   WPP will pay for Ogilvy stock by raising about $350 million with
an issue of securities that can be converted into WPP stock. The
rest will come from bank loans.
   Roman said Ogilvy, which was founded 41 years ago and has such
blue-chip clients as American Express Co., American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. and Unilever NV, would have preferred to remain
independent.
   He said the company ``pursued every reasonable course'' to do so
but found the WPP offer was ``far and away the best'' for Ogilvy
clients, shareholders and employees. Roman will remain chairman of
Ogilvy.
   At the shareholders' meeting, Roman said management considered
``everything from white knights to white squires to
recapitalization to leveraged buyouts'' but found it could not beat
WPP's all-cash offer.
   Roman declined to identify any of those he talked with about
alternatives.
   The shareholders' meeting attracted about 250 people and lasted
some 35 minutes, including a 12-minute presentation of the
company's commercials. Shareholders asked only three questions and
none voiced an opinion on the deal.
   Ogilvy stock traded in the mid-$20s a share a year ago and
closed at $32 a share the day before WPP's initial proposal was
disclosed. Ogilvy closed at $53.12{ a share Tuesday, down 12{ cents
from Monday's close.
   David Ogilvy, the Ogilvy founder who has been named chairman of
WPP as part of the takeover deal and had reportedly been critical
of WPP's initial advances, attended the meeting but did not address
it. He also declined to discuss the takeover with reporters.
   Burt Manning, the head of J. Walter Thompson, said he welcomed
Ogilvy's addition to WPP and said the buyout ``improves WPP's
chances for competing in the marketplace.''
   He said Thompson would nonetheless compete fiercely with
Ogilvy's main agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, for clients.
   Some analysts have said WPP's acquisition of Ogilvy could prompt
some advertisers to take their business elsewhere.
   Thompson works for Eastman Kodak Co., for instance, while Ogilvy
works for rival Polaroid Corp.
   Greg Ostroff, who follows advertising stocks for Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., said there may be potential conflicts involving as much as
$650 million of the new company's billings. But he declined to
estimate how much business the two companies may lose by sharing
the same corporate parent.
   Ostroff said the friendly tone of the Ogilvy buyout contrasts
with the hostility of the deal for Thompson's parent, JWT Group.
Several sizeable clients left Thompson after that takeover,
dissatisfied with turmoil in agency management.

   Crude oil futures soared above $21 a barrel
Tuesday before settling with moderate gains, while prices for
refined petroleum products headed lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, ended
the day 19 cents higher to close at $20.70 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The near-month contract had risen as much as 80 cents a barrel
to $21.31 earlier in the session before profit-taking by
professional traders eroded the gain.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, June
heating oil settled at 49.19 cents a gallon, down 0.68 cent. June
wholesale unleaded gasoline slid 0.29 cent to 65.80 cents a gallon.
   Madison Galbraith, a senior trader with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said internal market influences were largely responsible
for the runup in crude, which began in Europe, in the absence of
fresh fundamental news.

   The crush of higher interest rates forced new
housing construction down for the third straight month in April,
the government reported Tuesday in yet another sign that the
economic slowdown is hitting home.
   Residential construction starts dropped 2.7 percent last month
from March's rate to their lowest level in more than six years as
an upturn in the building of single-family homes was overshadowed
by a big drop in new work on apartments, the Commerce Department
reported.

   International Business Machines Corp., driving
to overcome the incompatibility of its computers, announced Tuesday
a major package of software that will run the same way on IBM
machines of all sizes.
   Analysts described OfficeVision as an important part of IBM's
attempt to duplicate and go beyond the successful strategies of
rivals such as Digital Equipment Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
   ``It is the largest applications software announcement in IBM's
history. Nothing else is close,'' said Joseph M. Guglielmi, IBM
vice president and president of the Application Systems Division.
   OfficeVision conceals the differences between computers from
users, harnessing mid-sized computers and big mainframes to work in
tandem with personal computers.
   OfficeVision will be welcomed most by companies that are heavy
users of IBM computers, while providing fewer advantages to
companies with a mix of machines, analysts predicted.
   ``It's a much-needed announcement,'' said Bob Djurdjevic of
Annex Research Inc. in Phoenix, who attended the announcement in
New York. ``I think they took a page out of DEC's book.''
   OfficeVision is another step in overcoming the problems IBM
created for itself in the 1960s and 1970s, when it introduced a
bewildering variety of machines that could not run the same
software.
   Digital, IBM's nearest rival, disparaged the announcement in
advance, saying the capabilities IBM is beginning to introduce have
long been available on its own Vax series of computers.
   But Guglielmi said OfficeVision is superior in its ability to
mix and share data between programs and in its capacity to plug in
programs that are developed by other companies and have the same
look and feel.
   Fourteen software companies including Microsoft Corp. and Lotus
Development Corp. said today they would develop new versions of
their programs that would ``snap in'' to the OfficeVision family.
   According to IBM, OfficeVision will make it possible for someone
to tap all the computers of a company ``simply by manipulating
pictures on a workstation screen.''
   For example, IBM said, someone could get human-resources figures
out of a mainframe and salary figures from a mid-size computer,
then combine them all on the screen of a personal computer, without
needing to know where the information originated or how it was
delivered.
   Programs written for OfficeVision all will have the same ``look
and feel,'' saving users from having to relearn basic functions
every time they try a new program. That sameness is one of the keys
to success of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.
   To take full advantage of the new OfficeVision software,
customers will have to buy a new version of the base-layer software
for personal computers, known as Operating System-2 Extended
Edition 1.2.
   So far, IBM is the only company that makes personal computers
capable of using that particular version of base-layer software.
Other companies have indicated they intend to clone the IBM
machine, using IBM patent licenses.
   By linking its own brand of personal computers more tightly with
the rest of its product line, IBM is encouraging companies that
rely on IBM's big machines to buy IBM personal computers as well.
   The new PC base software will be available this fall. The
OfficeVision software will be available this year and next,
depending on the computer.
   Prices of OfficeVision range from a one-time charge of $210 for
a personal computer in a low-cost network to a one-time charge of
$51,000 and annual charges of $9,000 for the version that goes in
IBM's biggest mainframes.

<HEAD>Reports $1 Billion Loss In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial service conglomerate Southmark Corp.
reported Tuesday that it lost $1.04 billion in the first quarter
due largely to problem real estate loans.
   The loss for the three months ended March 31 compares to a $12.3
million shortfall the same time a year ago. Revenue totaled $406
million, down from $431 million in the 1988 period.
   Included in Southmark's quarterly results was an $829 million
provision for losses from its real estate portfolio, and $104
million in losses from discontinued operations involved in the
anticipated sale of the company's insurance holdings.
   Susan Seiter, Southmark's vice president for investor relations,
said the loan-loss provision was the result of a re-evaluation of
the company's $8 billion in assets undertaken by new management.
   ``Southmark's assumptions have been changed to reflect that
depressed conditions in important real estate markets have
continued longer than previously anticipated,'' said Chairman
Arthur G. Weiss, a Georgia businessman brought in to run the
company after directors fired Chairman Gene E. Phillips and Vice
Chairman William S. Friedman in January.
   ``Real estate is a cyclical business,'' Weiss said. ``The real
estate depression has lasted much longer that anyone expected, and
Southmark's financial capacity is not sufficient to carry all of
its assets and investments until a better day.''
   Within the past several weeks, the company has sold, or reached
agreements to sell, various assets for $167 million, all but $7
million in cash.
   One of Southmark's largest holdings is San Jacinto Savings and
Loan Association, one of Texas' many troubled thrifts. Although the
company said the Houston-based thrift currently meets federal
capital requirements, it has estimated additional loss reserves
below those requirements, although the institution would remain
solvent.
   Southmark also is continuing to seek a buyer for Integon Corp.,
its North Carolina-based insurance subsidiary.
   The $1.04 billion quarterly loss puts Southmark in technical
violation with agreements with holders of about $1.1 billion in
junk bonds, although the company said it has enough cash ``to
maintain operations and to remain current with its suppliers,
vendors and creditors for some time to come.''
   In the past nine months, stockholders' equity has dropped from
$701 million on June 30, 1988 to a minus-$428 million on March 31.
   The earnings announcement comes as Southmark's top executive
face a proxy fight with investor Herbert B. Parks of Greensboro,
N.C.
   Parks, who has complained that Weiss ``is in way over his
head,'' originally sought to replace the entire seven-member
Southmark board, but has had to reduce that to just three members
because of federal banking regulations.
   A special shareholders' meeting is scheduled for Friday in
Atlanta, where Southmark is incorporated.
   Southmark also has scheduled a meeting next week with
bondholders to discuss the company's plans and future.

<HEAD>Gold Giants Merger Bid Collapses After New York Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A deal that would have created the world's largest
gold company collapsed Tuesday after a New York judge refused to
lift an order blocking South Africa-controlled Minorco S.A. from
acquiring Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Minorco Chief Executive Sir Michael Edwardes said his company's
bid would lapse Wednesday after U.S. District Court Judge Michael
Mukasey maintained an injunction barring Minorco from buying more
Gold Fields shares.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco is the world's largest gold producer in
the non-communist world and Gold Fields is second.
   Edwardes said Minorco continued to be the largest single
shareholder in Gold Fields, with a nearly 30 percent stake, and
would ``keep the position under close review.''
   ``We will now energetically implement our strategy of
transforming Minorco into an operating company,'' he said.
``Minorco is now a familiar name in the market, both in Britain and
overseas, and has a very positive future.''
   Gold Fields Chief Executive Rudolph Agnew said he was ``highly
delighted'' with the result of the battle, calling it ``a
tremendous victory.''
   Minorco's $6 billion offer for all outstanding shares of Gold
Fields stock was to expire at midnight Wednesday.
   Gold Fields' share price fell by 47 pence to 13.73 pounds, or
$22.37, on the London Stock Exchange Tuesday, indicating the market
expected the takeover bid to fail.

   The dollar's sharp ascent stalled Tuesday as the
rally ran up against nervousness over government reports on foreign
trade and inflation.
   The Federal Reserve sold some dollars, but traders were divided
on whether the central bank's intervention was an important factor
in halting the currency's rise.
   The dollar finished higher against the French franc and Italian
lira but slightly lower against other major currencies.
   On Monday the dollar had reached its highest point against the
West German mark since the end of 1986 and its highest point
against the Japanese yen since November 1987. In one week the
dollar had tacked on 2.2 percent against each currency.
   ``The market is still bullish. Customers are willing to buy the
dollar and are looking for numbers to buy it,'' said Frank Conte, a
vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York.
   The Commerce Department was scheduled to report on the March
merchandise trade deficit on Wednesday and the Labor Department was
to announce figures on April consumer prices on Thursday.
   Although currency traders largely have ignored trade figures in
recent months, a particularly large deficit figure might be enough
to puncture the bubble of the recent speculative run-up in the
dollar, some traders believe.
   A big increase in consumer prices might actually help the dollar
by increasing the chance the Federal Reserve would push up interest
rates, something that makes dollar-denominated investments more
attractive.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6398 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6385 late Monday.
Later in New York the dollar also lost ground as the pound rose to
$1.6435 from $1.6410.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed up 0.20 yen at 137.00 yen, despite
reported intervention by the Bank of Japan. Later in London, the
dollar was quoted at 137.28 yen. By the end of the trading day in
New York, the dollar dropped to 136.81 yen from 137.15 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.9363 West German marks, down from 1.9390; 1.7310
Swiss francs, down from 1.7370; 1.1888 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1898; 6.5560 French francs, up from 6.5550; and 1,409.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,409.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.9426 West German marks, up from 1.9415; 1.7360 Swiss francs, down
from 1.7438; 6.5685 French francs, down from 6.5725; 2.1820 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1905; 1,408.75 Italian lire, down from
1,411.00; 1.1892 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1905.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $374.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $374.00 late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $374.40 compared with $379.25
late Friday. Bullion markets were closed in Switzerland on Monday.
   In Hong Kong on Tuesday, gold rose 69 cents an ounce to close at
$375.99.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $375.50 an ounce from $375.60 on Monday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$374 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $374.10 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.55 a troy ounce, compared
$5.53 Monday. On New York's Comex, silver edged up to $5.500 an
ounce from $5.491 on Monday.

   Supercomputer wizard Seymour Cray bid
farewell Tuesday to shareholders of Cray Research Inc., vowing to
compete against the company he founded with technology his
successors in management passed up.
   The spinoff of Seymour Cray's latest research project into a
separate company, announced late Monday, prompted Cray Research
stock to plunge $6 a share to $49.75 in heavy trading Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Seymour Cray said he does not intend to take on additional
investors in forming Cray Computer Corp. The company will start as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Cray Research and evolve within a year
into a company owned by existing Cray shareholders.
   The new company will receive $100 million in operating funds and
$50 million in assets in the next two years from Cray Research.
   ``What I'm getting is all the money I wanted,'' said Cray, who
will be chairman of the Colorado Springs, Colo., company. ``I don't
think I can spend more than $100 million.''
   In another development Tuesday, Minneapolis-based Cray Research
announced plans to sell its supercomputers to customers of Twin
Cities neighbor Control Data Corp. Control Data on April 17 shut
down its fledgling ETA Systems supercomputer subsidiary after it
lost $238 million in five years.
   How much money Control Data will receive for selling Cray's
machines under the new joint marketing agreement is not known, said
Thomas Charland, a Control Data spokesman.
   Seymour Cray gave birth to the supercomputer industry in 1972
after he was pushed out of Control Data _ another company he helped
found _ because his research was getting too expensive, he said. He
had gone to Control Data in 1957 because his role at a St. Paul
computer maker was shrinking in an expansion fueled by his
innovations. The company was a forerunner to Univac Corp., which
has evolved into Unisys Corp.
   ``It's been a circular career path,'' Cray told a crowded
auditorium at the company's annual shareholders' meeting. ``Once
again I'm hearing, `You've got a nice little project there. Here's
some money _ now go start you're own company.'''
   Under the restructuring, Cray Research will be able to focus on
its bread-and-butter Y-MP machines, which are produced in Chippewa
Falls, Wis. Cray Chairman John Rollwagen said Tuesday that it had
become too costly to fund both computer projects. Cray devoted $30
million last year to the Cray-3, which won't be unveiled until
1990, he said.
   Rollwagen also said customers were sometimes perplexed about the
competition within the company. Some were frustrated with having to
choose between the Y-MP and the Cray-3, he said.
   The textbook solution, Rollwagen said, would have been to settle
on one technology and shut down the other. But such a move would
have stifled America's competitiveness in an industry targeted by
the Japanese, especially because of ETA's failure, he said.
   ``By having two companies at least we have more odds,''
Rollwagen said. ``There's a backup plan if one fails.''
   Marcelo Gumucio, president and chief operating officer at Cray,
said NEC Corp. is the most formidable of three Japanese
competitors. But by Cray's calculations, Japan's three
supercomputer makers account for only about 14 percent of all
installed central processing units in the world. Cray's 485 central
processing units account for 76 percent and ETA machines account
for 10 percent, Gumucio said.
   Seymour Cray said he had mixed feelings about leaving, but he
denied rumors that he was at odds with management.
   ``I wasn't dissatisfied,'' Cray said. ``We both have had all the
resources we needed up until now.''
   He said the Cray-3, the first supercomputer to use the gallium
arsenide metal alloy as a semiconductor, will be demonstrated by
the end of this year. Sales should begin by 1990, but at a slower
pace than Cray Reserach had projected, he said.
   The two companies will enter cross-licensing and technology
transfer agreements involving both hardware and software. But by
the mid-1990s they should be all-out competitors, Rollwagen said.
   ``I think we have two fearless organizations here,'' Cray said.
``So may the best technology win. In the long-term, I think
technology will rule the day.''
   Before the spinoff can occur, approvals on the stock offering
are needed from the Internal Revenue Service and Securities and
Exchange Commission. Existing Cray shareholders would receive at
least 90 percent of the stock in the new company, Rollwagen said.
The rest would be held by Cray Research and officers of the new
company.

   Stock prices pulled back Tuesday amid selling to
collect profits amassed during the previous two strong sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which ran up a gain of
nearly 82 points on Monday and Friday, finished with a loss of
10.44 points at 2,453.45.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
791 down, 677 up and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.1 million
shares, down from 179.35 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 211.64 million shares.
   ``Basically, what we're seeing is a bit of a pullback after two
very strong days,'' said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at
the investment firm Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. ``This is
quite normal. The market took quite a run and needs to pause.''
   The selling, which wasn't confined to any particular type of
stock, appeared to be motivated mainly by the desire to collect
profits, he said.
   Market operators decided the time was right to sell because the
government is due to release some potentially market-moving
economic figures on Wednesday and Thursday, said Peter VandenBerg,
a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Selling in front of a couple of closely watched economic
numbers makes sense to me,'' VandenBerg said.
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to report on
the country's merchandise trade performance in March and the
following day the Labor Department releases its April consumer
price index.
   International Business Machines skidded 1] to 111]. The computer
giant unveiled a new OfficeVision family of software designed to be
compatible with IBM machines of all sizes.
   Among companies involved in mergers or attempted takeovers,
Ogilvy Group eased [ to 53[ in heavy over-the-counter trading as
more than 1.7 million shares changed hands. The advertising and
marketing concern has agreed to be acquired by Britain's WPP Group
for $54 a share, or about $864 million.
   Avon Products, which has received a $39-a-share offer from
privately-held Amway Corp., was up | at 40\, a new 52-week high.
Amway has indicated it would consider paying more if Avon would
agree to a negotiated deal.
   In the retail sector, J.C. Penney lost 1\, falling to 58}, after
the company reported a 2 percent earnings decline for its first
quarter. Department store operator Dayton Hudson, which said its
first-quarter earnings went up 29 percent, shed [ to 51].
   Occidental Petroleum led the list of actively traded NYSE issues
for much of the day and ended up | at 27~. The company dismissed as
untrue market speculation that it is planning a big announcement,
possibly about a corporate restructuring, when it meets securities
analysts next week.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $3.71 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.33 to 175.92.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.15 to 362.52, and

<HEAD>Forecasts of Rain Causes Drop in Grain Soybean Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices plunged Tuesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to forecasts of increased
rain.
   On other markets, copper prices continued to slide, livestock
and meat prices were mostly lower, energy futures were mixed in
volatile trading, and precious metals were mixed in quiet trading.
   Wheat settled 7{ cents to 8{ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 5\ cents
lower with May at $2.77{ a bushel; oats were 6{ cents to 7{ cents
lower with May at $1.84 a bushel; soybeans were 15} cents to 20}
cents lower with May at $7.32\ a bushel.
   ``Everyone was negative from the start of trading,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   National Weather Service forecasts of rain in the Southern
Plains were augmented by private forecasters who predicted heavy
rains would spread to western crop states.
   Soybean futures sell-stops were activated early in trading,
pushing new-crop prices below $7 for the first time in weeks, Gidel
said.
   Corn prices were not helped by the Agriculture Department's
announcement Monday that the Soviets would buy 450,000 metric tons
of corn, and expectations of an above-average yield in the Indiana,
Michigan and Ohio soft red wheat crop caused a selloff in wheat
futures, Gidel said.
   Copper prices continued a plunge that began Monday on the New
York's Commodities Exchange.
   ``The market is reflecting a supply-and-demand equation that has
deteriorated considerably in the last month,'' said William
O'Neill, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
``Technical selling has added to the momentum downward.''
   O'Neill said that there is lessening concern about the U.S.
labor situtation.
   ``The early indications are the tone the talks will take will
not be as negative as was thought at one time,'' he said.
   Copper was 2.50 cents to 2.90 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $1.171 a pound.
   Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
frantic trading spurred by rumors and news from non-OPEC nations
meeting in London.
   The near-month contract crude oil prices rose as much as 80
cents a barrel to $21.31 early in the session before profit-taking
by professional traders eroded the gain.
   Prices were affected by word that the Organization of Petroelum
Exporting Nations will not raise the ceiling on production at their
next meeting, said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc in New York.
   Ministers of non-OPEC nations announced Tuesday they haven't
made a decision on the amount of oil they will produce in the
second half of the year. However, they did indicate they favored
cooperating with OPEC.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was .11 cents to 19 cents
higher with June at $20.70 a barrel; heating oil was .68 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with June at 49.19 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .48 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at 65.80
cents a gallon.
   Trading in precious metals was in a very narrow range on the
Commodities Exchange. A pause in the rise in the dollar, caused a
pause in the drop of precious metals futures.
   Gold was .30 cents lower to .20 cents higher with May at $375.50
a troy ounce; Silver was .08 cent to .09 cent higher with May at
$5.50 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures plunged on the Chicaago Mercantile
Exchange, with frozen pork bellies down the 2 cents limit because
of concern over high inventory.
   There were reports that Agriculture Department's cold storage
report due out Monday will show near-record stocks of pork bellies
of about 156.5 million pounds, said Dale Benson of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   Cattle prices were forced lower on weak cash sales and a
spillover from the selloff of hog futures.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at
71.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .12 cent
higher with May at 77.12 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .85
cent lower with June at 47.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.60 cents to 2 cents lower with May at 33.75 cents a pound.

   Authorities in the township of Parsippany
are girding for Exxon Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting on
Thursday, where the 111-member police force expects to face a crowd
of hundreds coming to demonstrate against the giant oil company.
   ``At this point I have no idea what its going to cost, but the
mayor said he's going to send Exxon the bill for overtime and
taxpayer costs,'' Parsippany police Chief Michael Filippello said
Tuesday after a meeting with township officials.
   Expected to attend the meeting and gather outside are hundreds
of demonstrators protesting Exxon's cleanup of the March 24 oil
spill that followed the grounding of an Exxon tanker in Alaska's
Prince William Sound and polluted 800 miles of shoreline.
   The company already has been criticized harshly by consumer
advocates, environmentalists and others as having responded too
slowly and ineffectively to the spill.
   Parsippany, located about 35 miles west of Exxon's Manhattan
headquarters, was chosen for the annual meeting partly because
35,000 of Exxon's 713,000 shareholders live in northern New Jersey,
the largest such concentration in the country, Exxon officials said.
   Also, 5,500 of Exxon's 100,000 employees live and work in the
region, said Exxon spokesman Bill Smith.
   Edwin Rothchild, energy policy director of the Washington-based
consumer rights group Citizen Action, said he expected several
hundred people to gather at the Aspen Manor Hotel to hear speeches
and show shareholders their displeasure with the company's handling
of the cleanup.
   ``We're not going to let them off the hook,'' he said. ``We have
a number of points we want to make and we plan to be heard.''
   Rothchild said he and more than 30 coalition members own Exxon
stock and plan to attend the meeting.
   National environmental and consumer organizations also plan to
return about 20,000 Exxon gasoline credit cards turned in by
consumers responding to a mail-in protest campaign, said Rob
Stuart, legislative program director of the 70,000-member New
Jersey Public Interest Group.
   Smith said the company plans to do little differently during
Thursday's meeting and will hold its usual news conference
afterward with Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lawrence
G. Rawl and President Lee R. Raymond.
   ``The only things we're doing differently is we're having pool
coverage by camera crews and still photographers because of the
apparent television interest,'' he said. ``We just wouldn't be able
to fit all the network camera crews that want to go.''
   Smith said Exxon had received requests for 6,300 tickets,
although only about 2,200 people would get tickets to attend the
meeting.
   Filippello said the township has seen such protests before,
specifically a sit-in at the headquarters of General Public
Utilities Corp., which owns the Three Mile Island nuclear plant
near Harrisburg, Pa., the site of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident.
   ``Our position is that these people have a legitimate right to
make the point they're trying to make, and Exxon has the right to
its meeting,'' Filippello said. ``We're there as neutral
observers.''
   Filippello said he has spoken with groups representing
demonstrators, who were trying to keep police informed of their
plans.
   He said the township would bring in extra officers for crowd
control and would try to keep demonstrators within the hotel
parking lot, in order to keep them from spilling over onto a nearby
busy street.

<HEAD>Smaller Rival To Cray Announces New Supercomputer Models</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cray, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thinking Machines Corp., a small supercomputer
rival of Cray Research Inc., announced two new models on Tuesday
and said it had reached a marketing agreement with Digital
Equipment Corp.
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based company used a New York news
conference to describe progress in getting its computers placed
with industrial and academic customers who use it for complex
problems such as aircraft design, stress analysis and molecular
biology.
   Danny Hillis, Thinking Machines' founding scientist, said in an
interview that his company is the world leader in a style of
computing known as parallel processing, a field in which
researchers say Americans are far ahead of the Japanese.
   Japan's NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. are chipping
away at Cray's lead in supercomputer market share because they are
better at building fast single processors that don't rely on
parallel design.
   The Thinking Machines are known as massively parallel computers
because they harness thousands of relatively low-powered processors
to work on a single problem.
   The company devotes 80 percent of its effort to the software
that permits parallel processing to occur, Hillis said.
   ``I don't subscribe to the view that the Japanese are inherently
no good at software,'' he said. But he added, ``I think it's a fair
fight, and we're ahead.''
   The Thinking Machines supercomputers are distinctive for their
shape _ large, black cubes _ and the panels of blinking red lights
visible through a dusky window on one side. Cray's machines are
shaped like horseshoes.
   Under the marketing agreement announced Tuesday, Thinking
Machines and Digital will market supercomputing systems made up of
computers from both companies, selling them at discounts to as many
as 25 universities, Thinking Machines said.
   The smaller of the two new systems, the CM-2a, comes with either
4,096 or 8,192 processors. It can perform 1 billion or 2 billion
operations a second, depending on its size, and costs $500,000 or
$1 million.
   The CM-2a's relatively low price makes it suited for academic
customers that have previously not been able to afford a
supercomputer, Thinking Machines said. First deliveries are
scheduled for June 1989.
   The more powerful system is an upgrade of the older,
64,000-processor CM-2. It has the same number of processors but
more internal memory. Prices range from $2 million to $10 million
and first deliveries are scheduled for June 1989.

<HEAD>Time Inc.'s HBO Unit to Launch Comedy Channel on Basic Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Box Office Inc., which provides the
pay-television services HBO and Cinemax, said Tuesday it plans to
launch the first advertiser-supported channel devoted entirely to
comedy starting this fall.
   The new service, which would be offered to cable operators for
inclusion at no extra charge to subscribers to their basic service,
would represent the Time Inc. unit's first venture into basic cable
programming.
   Backers of the project say comedy offers a distinctive new
programming vehicle that could help cable operators draw new
subscribers.
   But the new service will have to fight for channel space with
several other recently launched cable networks such as Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.'s Turner Network Television, the National
Broadcasting Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel and an array
of regional sports networks.
   Michael Fuchs, Home Box Office chairman and chief executive,
said in a news release cable opertors told of the plans for the
comedy service over the past several months have expressed ``strong
support.''
   Richard Beahrs, president of the HBO comedy channel, said he has
only just begun asking cable operators for commitments to carry the
service and declined to say how many he has received.
   Time also owns a cable operation, American Television and
Communications Corp., that could provide several million
subscribers to get the comedy channel started, however.
   Beahrs declined to say how much Home Box Office was prepared to
spend to launch the service but said the company realized it may
take a number of years to be profitable.
   Home Box Office may also face competition from a rival comedy
channel from the MTV Networks division of Viacom Inc.
   Barry Kluger, a spokesman for MTV Networks, said MTV has been
examining for five years the possibility of launching a comedy
channel and may make a decision soon on whether to launch an
all-comedy service.
   Home Box Office currently includes comedy shows in its HBO and
Cinemax lineups of movies, sports, music, drama, documentaries and
special programs.
   Its comedy channel will feature hosts who will have their own
shows usually running two hours and incorporating live performances
with clips from stand-up performances, current comedy films,
classic TV shows and theater. It will also carry an occasional
full-length motion picture or situation comedy.

<HEAD>Amway: Would Keep Avon's Direct Sales Network Separate From Its Own</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amway Corp. said Tuesday it would operate Avon
Products Inc.'s direct-selling business separately from its own
distributor organization if Amways's $2.1 billion bid for Avon is
successful.
   Amway Chairman Jay Van Andel and President Richard M. DeVos also
stated in a letter to Avon's board of directors that they don't
contemplate making any radical changes in the Avon direct-sales
organization.
   They said, however, that they would attempt to increase the
quantity and type of products available from Avon sales
representatives.
   Instead of selling primarily cosmetics and beauty aids, ``we see
a substantial opportunity to expand the Avon product line to
include a full range of health aids under the Avon name.''
   Avon says it has about 1.5 million sales representatives
marketing Avon products in 85 countries. Amway has about 1 million
distributors who handle Amway's own products and some products and
services of other companies.
   The Amway executives, co-founders of the privately held company
based in Ada, Mich., said they intend to ``explore enhancements in
the compensation structure and benefits'' for the Avon
representatives.
   They repeated their offer to discuss all aspects of their
$39-a-share takeover offer.
   Avon executives didn't return telephone calls for comment at the
company's New York headquarters late Tuesday.

   Financial writers from The Associated Press, The
Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times were among the
winners of the 22nd annual Awards for Excellence in Business and
Financial Journalism announced Tuesday by John Hancock Financial
Services.
   Awards also went to writers from The Kansas City Times, The
Daily Sentinel of Grand Junction, Colo., the Washington Post
Writers Group and the National Journal magazine.
   The Hancock awards annually recognize ``lucid reporting,
interpretation and writing of business and financial news,'' the
Boston-based financial services company said in a statement from
Chairman E. James Morton.
   The winners, whose work was judged to have improved the public's
understanding of business issues during 1988, will be honored at a
dinner in New York in November at a program co-sponsored by John
Hancock and Fordham University's Graduate School of Business.
   The honors carry a cash award of $5,000 in each of the seven
categories.
   The winners are:
   _The Associated Press in the syndicated and news service writers
category for eight articles on the rush of corporate mergers and
restructurings that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.
The seven writers contributing to the project were Rick Gladstone,
Peter Coy, John Cunniff, Chet Currier, Marcy Gordon, Vivian Marino
and Skip Wollenberg. The Hancock award was the second in a row and
the ninth overall for the AP. In 1987, the AP won for its coverage
of the stock market crash.
   _Bruce Stokes of The National Journal in the category for
writers of national magazines of general interest for his
three-part series, ``Land of the Rising Yen.'' The series previewed
the next round of Japanese challenges to America's economic
strength, including the banking industry.
   _Bernard Wysocki Jr. of The Wall Street Journal among writers
for financial and business newspapers and magazines for his report,
``The Final Frontier.'' The project examined how the U.S. lead in
technology is imperiled by ever-stronger competition, particularly
from the Japanese. It is the fifth time the Journal has been a
Hancock recipient.
   _A team of nine writers from the Los Angeles Times in the
category of newspapers with circulation above 300,000 for a
four-part series on the struggles Americans encounter working for
Japanese companies. Contributing to the project were James
Flanigan, Nancy Yoshihara, Jonathan Peterson, Jim Schachter,
Douglas Frantz, Sam Jameson, Michael A. Hiltzik, James Risen and
Karl Schoenberger. It is the sixth time the Times has won a Hancock.
   _Charlie Crumpley of The Kansas City Times in the category of
newspapers with circulations between 100,000 and 300,000 for a
five-part series analyzing the transformation of the Kansas
City-area economy from manufacturing to service industries. The
series also pointed out roadblocks to the area's future growth.
   _Gary Harmon of The Daily Sentinel among newspapers with
circulations under 100,000 for an eight-part series on workers'
compensation. The project examined how the cost of workers'
compensation insurance has severely hampered the competitiveness of
Colorado business.
   _Robert Kuttner of the Washington Post Writers Group among
financial and business columnists for his analyses of topics such
as America's changing role in world politics, the surging economy,
the wealth of the Japanese, the U.S. government's role in
developing industrial technology and the health of the Social
Security system. It is the second time the Washington Post Writers
Group has won the award.
   Winners were selected by a panel of judges consisting of Richard
Des Ruisseaux, of The Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal and
president of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists; Peter
Holmes, assistant managing editor of The Washington Times and
president of the National Press Club; Philip Moeller, business
editor of The Baltimore Sun and president of the Society of
American Business Editors & Writers; William Small, director of the

<HEAD>Dutch Officials Want Changes To Improve Safety of New Boeing</HEAD>

   Four European nations will ban
commercial flights by Boeing Co.'s new 747-400 series jetliner
unless the U.S. company makes design changes to improve safety, a
Dutch spokesman said Tuesday.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said it would discuss
certification with a Dutch regulatory official on Wednesday, one
day before the scheduled delivery of the first of 13 Boeing
747-400s to KLM, the Dutch state airliner.
   Transport Ministry spokesman Harald Hameleers said Boeing was
asked ``to implement some minor modifications in the 400 series'
design.''
   ``We think the 747-400 is a safe plane but there is always room
for improvement,'' he added.
   Hameleers said the Dutch demanded modifications ``months ago''
in concert with civil aviation agencies in Britain, West Germany
and France, which together form the Joint Airworthiness
Requirements committee.
   ``We will not issue a full certificate of airworthiness unless
Boeing adopts our requirements,'' Hameleer said in an interview.
   Alain Monnier, an official of France's Directorate General of
Civil Aviation, said the Netherlands spoke for all four member
countries. The committee meets in Paris on Monday to discuss
Boeing's response, Hameleers said.
   Boeing said in a statement that the company ``has worked hard to
satisfy'' certification requirements of the four-nation committee
on a derivative 747-400 airplane. It said the 747-400, the largest
commercial jetliner in the world, has received full certification
from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
   A representative of the Netherlands regulatory agency will meet
with Boeing to review certification of the 747-400 for operation by
KLM, the statement said.
   The statement said Boeing expected the plane would be delivered
on schedule after those discussions.
   KLM expects to receive its first 747-400 at Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport on Thursday. The carrier has ordered 13 of the airplanes
costing an estimated $1.5 billion, according to KLM spokesman Peter
Wellhuener.
   At issue are changes in the design of floor beams supporting the
400 series' upper deck, and better separation of certain electrical
circuits, said Hameleers.
   ``It's nothing earth-shattering, but Boeing has been making
trouble on the issue,'' Hameleers said. He claimed the circuitry
changes could be made in a few hours, while the floor beam
modifications would ``probably require some study.''
   Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese was quoted by The Seattle
Times as saying that the upper-deck structure design was not part
of the FAA's certification process because it is built the same as
on previous 747 models.
   Wellhuener said the airline planned to use the new planes from
early June.
   The Dutch carrier was to be the first European airline to fly
the 747-400. Other European customers include British Airways, West
Germany's Lufthansa, and Air France.

   As the season to spray Washington state
apple trees with Alar arrives, Uniroyal Chemical Co. confirmed
Tuesday that none of the controversial chemical has been purchased
by farmers since January.
   The Middlebury, Conn., company also disputed studies showing
that over 30 percent of the nation's apples contain Alar, a growth
retardant that has been identified as a possible carcinogen in
recent months.
   If all 112,000 pounds of Alar sold to apple farmers in 1988 had
been used, at 3 pounds per acre it would have covered 7.6 percent
of the nation's 490,000 acres of orchards, said Christopher Exton,
a marketing manager for Uniroyal.
   The percentage should be even less for the 1989 crop.
   ``Sales have been zero from the beginning of February,'' Exton
said in a telephone interview, noting that demands by some
politicians and consumer groups to remove Alar from the market
would accomplish little since none is being sold.
   Battered by low sales and slumping prices, the apple industry is
voluntarily backing off on Alar use in an attempt to win back
consumer confidence.
   The growth regulator is sprayed on trees during the spring and
summer and improves the color, crispness and shelf life of red
apples.
   ``I know of no one who is planning on using it,'' said Chris
Schlect, head of the Northwest Horticultural Council in Yakima. ``I
would be very much surprised in anybody intends to use it this
spring.''
   Washington produces half the nation's apples, and many growers
have joined the call for an Alar ban as a way to win back their
markets.
   A debate has arisen over exactly how much Alar is used, with the
federal government and the industry initially contending it was
about 5 percent, and last week revising the figure to up to 15
percent.
   The CBS program ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday said some studies
indicated up to 38 percent of the crop is treated.
   But Exton said studies showing a high use of Alar are
statistically flawed.
   Alar is used to improve shelf life of stored apples, so the
number of Alar-treated apples is greater this time of year than
earlier in the season, Exton said.
   Alar, the marketing name for daminozide, makes up less than 1
percent of Uniroyal's $750 million in annual sales, and sales have
declined 75 percent since 1985 when the controversy first came to
light, Exton said.
   The chemical is also used on peanuts and some cherries, and on
non-edible trees and plants, he said.
   The controversy began when the private Natural Resources Defense
Council issued a report in late February that concluded that
consuming apples or apple products treated with Alar increased
cancer risk in children.

<HEAD>Black Workers Expand Strike Protesting Divestment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black workers on Tuesday
expanded a strike protesting Mobil Corp.'s failure to negotiate
with their union prior to announcing the sale of its South African
holdings.
   The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which represents about 80
percent of Mobil's 1,500 black employees in South Africa, said 350
workers were on strike at depots throughout the Johannesburg region
and at the ports of East London and Port Elizabeth.
   The union had said 240 workers were involved when work stoppages
began Monday around Johannesburg. Mobil officials confirmed the
strike but released no details about the impact on operations.
   The union plans to poll its members this week to determine if
they support a nationwide strike against Mobil because of its
refusal to negotiate the terms of its disinvestment.
   The U.S. company announced on April 28 that it was selling its
holdings in South Africa to the General Union Mining Corp., a
conglomerate known as Gencor that owns a petroleum subsidiary.
   Mobil said Gencor would honor all existing arrangements with the
union. But union officials said Mobil had lied when it rebuffed
previous attempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no
plans for divestment.
   Jacques Franken, industrial relations manager for Mobil's South
African operation, said Tuesday that the South African management
had informed the union about the disinvestment as soon as the news
was received from U.S. headquarters.
   ``The disinvestment has nothing to do with Mobil South Africa,
as it is the U.S. corporation that is disinvesting,'' he said.
   The union had approached Mobil and several other foreign
companies in South Africa, asking for one-year advance notice of
any pullout, guarantees of job security and disclosure of the terms
of sale.
   Scores of U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa in the
past five years, citing economic considerations and pressure from
the anti-apartheid movement.

   The U.S. dollar was slightly higher against the
Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange ended trading with a moderate gain.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
210.16 points the previous day, added another 52.27 points, or 0.15
percent, to finish the morning session at 33,978.72.
   The dollar, which opened at 137.12 yen, up 0.12 yen from
Tuesday's 137.00-yen close, was changing hands at 137.13 yen at
late morning.
   Although the dollar slightly weakened after central bank
interventions in Tokyo and in New York overnight, investors began
buying again Wednesday morning following an uptrend in the Sydney
market, which opened earlier, traders said.
   Most market players, however waited on the sidelines ahead of
the release of fresh U.S. economic data. The United States is to
announce the nation's trade figures for March later Wednesday.
   On the stock exchange, share prices rose because market players
were reassured as the yen's fall slowed down at around 137-yen,
dealers said.
