   President Bush on Wednesday declared the
earthquake-shattered San Francisco Bay region a major disaster
area, calling the devastation a ``matter of grave national
concern'' and directing an initial $273 million to relief efforts.
   Bush said he wants to inspect the damage personally, and
officials said the trip West was likely Friday or Saturday.
   ``I want the citizens of the San Francisco Bay area and its
neighbors first to know that our hearts are with them as they face
this terrible tragedy,'' the president said.
   ``Words can't adequately convey our sentiments, I know, but I
can say that we will take every step and make every effort to help
the bay area in its hour of need.''
   Stung by criticism of the government's response to Hurricane
Hugo, Bush made a point of praising the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which plays the lead role in federal disaster
relief efforts.
   ``I hope there will be less carping,'' Bush said. ``I think they
took a bad hit on that other one from some quarters.'' He commented
after an unscheduled morale-boosting visit to FEMA headquarters
where relief efforts by 25 federal agencies were being planned and
coordinated.
   Bush received a telephoned report from Air Force Two carrying
Vice President Dan Quayle to Washington from a tour of the damage.
Quayle told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington he
stressed the importance of volunteer rescue efforts and
preparation, noting an August earthquake response drill held by
state and federal agencies.
   ``It could have been much worse if we had not had that
preparation,'' Quayle said.
   The vice president said he believed ``It's under control and we
are making progress. ... There will be adequate personnel. There
are many volunteers. Federal funds will be forthcoming.''
   Bush received messages of sympathy and offers of support from
numerous world leaders including Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who received U.S. help after last December's devastating
earthquake in Armenia.
   ``If these countries can help, we certainly welcome their
assistance,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush said he wants to visit the devastated area but that ``there
are certain security constraints connected with this job and the
last thing we want to do is clutter things up. But I do want to
make a trip out there and I probably will.''
   The White House said the initial $273 million will come from
unallocated money in a $1.1 billion appropriation approved earlier
for Hurricane Hugo relief.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, said members of Congress
were giving the agency ``high marks'' so far but it would need more
money. ``No question we would want to take (funds) out of existing
programs. We need the administration's cooperation to get that
funding,'' Fazio said.
   Bush's earthquake disaster declaration authorizes the government
to play a major role in relief and recovery efforts, paying at
least 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding bridges and other public
facilities and providing low-cost loans for individuals and
businesses.
   Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing
that it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns
or make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
   The areas covered by Bush's order include the city and county of
San Francisco and the counties of Alameda, Monterey, San Benito,
San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.
   Bush, during a meeting with elementary school principals from
around the country, singled out Ray Tolcacher, superintendent of
Windsor Union School District in San Francisco.
   ``We just hope that your kids and your schools and all the
families are safe and sound,'' Bush said.
   He said his administration is working closely with California
state officials to provide assistance, saying, ``It is a matter of
grave national concern.''
   Within hours of the earthquake, Bush had dispatched
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to San Francisco and
directed Vice President Dan Quayle, in San Diego after a speech, to
hook up with Skinner for a helicopter inspection tour. They were in
touch during the day by telephone with Bush.
   Fitzwater acknowledged the relief efforts for Hurricane Hugo
could be strapped by the diversion of funds to the earthquake.
``When the money runs out, we'll have to assess the need and go
back for more,'' he said.

   Safety complaints from stunt
workers at the new Disney-MGM Studios are being investigated by
federal inspectors for possible safety violations
   The tourist attraction says it is cooperating in the review, and
a company spokesman said Walt Disney World does not expect to be
cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   Inspectors from OSHA's Atlanta office were called in after a
performer was involved in an accident last month during an outdoor
show that recreates scenes from Indiana Jones adventure movies.
   The stunt worker fell from a moving ladder and OSHA said the
complaints indicated the man suffered injuries to his head, neck,
back and right elbow.
   DUring the show, a cast of stuntpeople escape from exploding
jeeps, jump from buildings and re-enact other daring escapades that
Indiana Jones manages on celluloid. The show is performed several
times daily.
   Some workers complained that broken equipment was causing falls,
and smoke machines were irritating the workers' noses and throats.
They also complained of slippery footing and improperly placed
padding, used to cushion falls.
   ``I don't know of anything other than some minor falls,'' said
Disney's publicity director, Charlie Ridgway. ``I know that in the
training process and the whole business there are lots of sore
muscles, but there haven't been any serious accidents.''
   He said Disney has tried to ensure the safety of its workers,
and the company would be willing to accept any OSHA recommendations
for improvements.
   To assess the show's safety, OSHA's advisers will review the
procedures.
   ``This is really something new for us, so it may take several
weeks to complete,'' said Rafael Rodriguez, an OSHA industrial
hygienist.

   On the morning of April 18, 1906, the people of San Francisco
woke abruptly to face calamity _ a devasting earthquake bringing
widespread devastation and fire that killed at least 2,500, and
possibly 5,000 people. Here are some excerpts of Associated Press
accounts of that disaster:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 _ Earthquakes and fire today have put
nearly half of San Francisco in ruins.
   At least 200 persons have been killed, thousands injured, and
the property loss will exceed $100,000,000.
   Thousands are homeless and destitute and all day long streams of
people have been fleeing from the stricken districts to places of
safety. ...
   Most of the principal buildings have already been destroyed and
others are in imminent danger. Over all the scene of desolation
hangs a dense pall of smoke. ...
   It was 5:13 this morning when a terrific earthquake shock shook
the whole city and surrounding country.
   One shock apparently lasted two minutes and there was almost
immediate collapse of flimsy structures all over the city. ...
   The people became panic-stricken and rushed into the streets,
most of them in their night attire. They were met by showers of
falling buildings, bricks, cornices, and walls. Many were instantly
crushed to death, while others were dreadfully mangled. ...
   Fires have been raging all day, and the fire department has been
powerless to do anything except dynamite buildings threatened. All
day long explosions have shaken the city and added to the terror of
the inhabitants. ...
   All efforts to stay the progress of the fire were futile. The
south side of Market Street from Ninth street to the bay was soon
ablaze, the fire covering a belt two blocks wide. ...
   At the same time the commercial establishments and banks north
of Market street were burning. The burning district in this section
of the city extended from Sansome street to the water front, and
the entire city seemed to be in flames. ...
   The greatest destruction occurred in that part of the city which
was reclaimed from San Francisco bay. Much of the devasted district
was at one time low marshy ground covered by water at high tide. ...
   The damage by the earthquake to the residence portion of the
city, the finest part of which is on Nob Hill and Pacific Heights,
seems to have been slight. ...
   The magnificent Fairmount Hotel, not yet completed, stands on
the brink of Nob Hill, overlooking the bay. The hotel was not
seriously damaged. ...
   Telegraph and telephone communication was shut off for a time.
   The Western Union was put completely out of business and the
Postal company was the only company that managed to get a wire out
of the city. About 10 o'clock even the Postal was forced to
suspend. ...
   Deep fissures opened in the filled-in ground near the shore and
the Union Ferry depot was injured. ...
   The Valencia Hotel, a four-story wooden building, sank into the
basement, a pile of splintered timbers, under which were pinned
many dead and dying occupants of the house. The basement was full
of water and some of the helpless victims were drowned. ...
   At 9 o'clock this morning 1,000 men from the Presido arrived
down town to patrol the city streets. ...The soldiers have been
ordered to shoot down thieves caught in the act of robbng the dead,
and to guard with their lives the millions of dollars worth of
property which has been placed in the streets, that it may escape
the ravages of the flames.

   Scientists hope the Galileo space
probe, carried into Earth orbit aboard the space shuttle Atlantis,
will find clues to the origin of the universe when it reaches
Jupiter in six years.
   The mission also will look for organic chemicals in the gasses
covering the largest planet, chemicals that could also have been
the basis for life on Earth.
   ``The Jupiter system is so full of exciting phenomenon that we
hardly know what's going on there,'' said Torrence Johnson, the
Galileo project's chief scientist. ``What we're trying to do is
learn fundamental things about how the universe was formed, how it
ticks and where we came from.''
   The planet Jupiter and its moons are in effect a mini-solar
system, and Jupiter itself is often called a star that never caught
fire. Its hydrogen-rich atmosphere should be a window into the
conditions that existed when the Sun and its planets formed.
   The small probe will radio back readings during its 75-minute
plunge into the fifth planet's atmosphere, but Galileo itself will
continue a wide orbit around Jupiter for 22 months, keeping track
of changes in its weather for the first long-term study of an outer
planet.
   While Jupiter is the main target, Galileo will first circle
Venus to learn how its clouds circulate and look for lightning.
Then the craft will fly twice by Earth, mapping hydrogen in the
home planet's atmosphere and photographing the moon's north pole to
look for ice.
   Galileo will also povide the first close-up data about
asteroids, passing within 600 miles of Gaspra and Ida on its way to
Jupiter.

   Astronaut Donald E. Williams, a
decorated Navy captain who flew 330 combat missions in Vietnam, is
commanding Atlantis on its mission to deploy a nuclear-powered
probe to Jupiter.
   Williams, 47, an astronaut for 11 years, flew one previous
shuttle mission, as pilot of Discovery, in 1985.
   Williams said he looked forward to flying in space again. ``It's
been quite a long time,'' he said.
   The Lafayette, Ind., native received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Purdue in 1964. He and his wife, Linda,
have two children; Jonathan, 15; and Barbara 13.
   ``The mission is a very exciting one in my mind,'' Williams
said. ``We're going to greatly increase the knowledge of humankind
... as a result of this mission.''
   Characterizing his first shuttle flight as ``one of the
highlights'' of his career, Williams added it also has been a
longtime goal to command a mission.
   Williams wasn't sure he will be ready to hang up his flight suit
after the Atlantis mission.
   ``I'd certainly like to fly again if that seems to be in the
program,'' he said.

   Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley, one
of two space rookies assigned to the Atlantis mission, looked
forward to gazing down at the Earth while he was in orbit.
   McCulley, 46, the pilot of Atlantis, is making his first shuttle
mission after being an astronaut for five years.
   He was born in San Diego, Calif., but considers Livingston,
Tenn., his hometown. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees
in metallurgical engineering from Purdue University.
   His wife, Jane, is an amateur artist who helped design the
flight patch for the Atlantis crew. McCulley has five children;
Marla, 20; Marcy, 17; Cynthia, 14; Robyn, 10; and Sarah, 3.
   McCulley entered the Navy as an enlisted man and served on one
diesel and two nuclear-powered submarines. He received his
officer's commission in 1970.
   ``The thing that excites me the most (about flying in space) is
to think about looking out and being able to see a round horizon
... being able to see much of the world,'' he said.
   When NASA officials told him he would be on the Galileo mission,
McCulley said he was thrilled to be part of a project he can follow
for years.
   ``I'm so fortunate, it's incredible,'' McCulley said in a recent
interview. ``I came out of high school when I was 17 years old and
joined the Navy, and here I am, 10 or 11 promotions later, getting
ready to go fly in space. I have very few complaints about life.''

   Shannon Lucid, a mission specialist
and veteran of one previous shuttle mission, rode the shuttle into
space Wednesday to play a key role in the deployment of the Galileo
probe.
   Mrs. Lucid, 46, had the job of checking Galileo's rocket
booster. The two-stage rocket was to propel the probe out of Earth
orbit to start it on a six-year journey to Jupiter.
   The biochemist flew one previous shuttle mission in 1985.
   She was born in Shanghai, where her parents were missionaries.
Just six weeks after her birth, the family was taken prisoner by
the Japanese. A year later, they were released in a prisoner
exchange.
   She received her bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from
the University of Oklahoma, and was selected as an astronaut in 1978
   When she was young, she wanted to be an explorer but she thought
there wouldn't be much left to explore by the time she grew up.
After reading science fiction and reports about work on a rocket,
she came to another conclusion.
   ``I was thinking, well shoot, we've got the whole universe. No
one will have it all explored by the time I grow up. So I thought
that's what I'd like to be when I grew up. Of course, the United
States didn't have a space program at that time.''
   She and her husband, Michael have three children; Kawai, 21;
Shandara, 19; and Michael, 14.

   Mission specialist Ellen S. Baker,
a physician and space rookie, was sitting alone on the middeck
during the shuttle's blastoff Wednesday.
   Once in orbit, Mrs. Baker, 36, was responsible for checking the
Galileo space probe before deployment. She and fellow astronaut
Franklin Chang-Diaz also were designated to make a spacewalk if one
was required.
   She was born in Fayetteville, N.C., but her family later moved
to New York City, where her mother, Claire Shulman, is president of
the borough of Queens. She earned a bachelor's degree in geology
from State University of New York at Buffalo and received her
doctorate in medicine from Cornell.
   She joined NASA in 1981 as a medical officer at the Johnson
Space Center.
   She said she went to NASA to be a doctor, but after three years
decided she wanted to be an astronaut. She was selected as an
astronaut in 1984.
   She and her husband, Kenneth, have a 1-year-old daughter, Karen.
   Mrs. Baker said it was difficult for her to believe she finally
would be flying in space.
   ``You work in a place so long, and the time finally arrives
...,'' she said. ``It hasn't really clicked just yet.''

   Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, a
physicist doubling as a mission specialist and flight engineer
aboard Atlantis, has flown on one previous shuttle.
   During the shuttle's liftoff and landing, his job was to monitor
displays on the flight deck with the commander, pilot and mission
specialist Shannon Lucid.
   Chang-Diaz also was to help photograph the deployment of the
Galileo probe, and he, along with mission specialist Ellen Baker
would participate in any unscheduled spacewalk.
   Chang-Diaz, 39, a native of Costa Rica and a naturalized U.S.
citizen, received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
from the University of Connecticut and a doctorate in applied
plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1977.
   Chang-Diaz, a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, became an astronaut in 1980 and made his first
shuttle flight in 1986 aboard Columbia.
   He and his wife, Peggy, have three children: Jean, 15; Sonia,
11; and Lidia, 1.
   Chang-Diaz said he also works on ways to help Latin American
countries get involved in space programs and hopes he can one day
help establish an agency in the Western Hemisphere that is similar
to the European Space Agency.

   Abdou Mohammed sold a cow in his Egyptian
village to to buy a bus ticket to Libya where he hoped to make his
fortune as a farmer.
   Today, squatting beside the sidewalk stand where he sells
plastic water bottles and combs, he laments his decision.
   ``I can't find any work,'' he said. ``All I want is just to .. .
go back home.''
   Mohammed is among thousands of Egyptians who in the last four
months have poured across the border in search of prosperity in
Libya, formerly Egypt's bitterest enemy. Their enticements are
warmer official relations between the two countries and bleak
prospects in Egypt with its faltering economy.
   Wealth eludes most of them in Libya, however. They compete with
thousands of workers from South Korea, Poland, Romania, Sudan and
Ghana for fewer jobs as reduced oil revenues force Libya to abandon
grandiose construction schemes.
   Many Egyptians now arrive with ``Made in Egypt'' aluminum pots,
plastic mats and chocolate bars, all Libyan favorites.
   But those like Mohammed and his friend, Rabi'a Ahmed, brought
only their visions of careers as farmers, expecting to earn much
more money than back home in Sohag, 245 miles south of Cairo,
Egypt's capital.
   ``There are no jobs, so I've had to buy these from other
Egyptians,'' said Mohammed, waving a hand over his wares lined up
on the sidewalk of an old covered bazaar. Nearby, other Egyptians
were selling similar items arrayed on similar cardboard sheets.
   ``I sold my cow for 2,000 pounds ($780),'' Mohammed said.
   That's gone, and ``now all I want is just to make enough for a
return ticket and go back home,'' he said.
   However, Rabi'a Ahmed, who sold land to finance his move to
Libya, said things could be worse than hawking Egyptian
paraphernalia to Libyans.
   ``I might continue the business,'' he said.
   Life is not plush for Egyptians newly arrived in Benghazi, the
first major stop for buses on the routes across the border opened
last summer for the first time in more than a decade.
   Scenes from Cairo's poor and squalid quarters have been
transported to this Mediterranean city. Egyptian women carrying
babies roam among cars at traffic lights to beg. Others wipe
windshields in hopes of earning a few dinars or sell plastic
lanterns.
   In September, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, came
across hundreds of homeless Egyptians in one of Benghazi's main
parks. Shortly afterwards, they were moved to an unfinished
concrete-and-steel school building.
   All an Egyptian needs to travel to Libya is a 75-pound ($30)
work permit or an invitation.
   When borders were reopened, thousands of Egyptians poured into
Libya, many of them merchants. Along with them came skilled workers
and farmers, riding 20 buses and 250 private cars or taxis a day.
   At Salloum, a border crossing on the Egyptian side, the few
passport control and customs officers were unprepared for the
traffic load one recent day.
   It took seven hours for a bus with 53 passengers to pass through.
   During the wait, a passport officer said: ``An average 1,500
Egyptians go through every day by bus and car. There were a lot
more a month ago. Many have come back, without jobs and in tears.''

   The deadly earthquake, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, that

   ``I would love to hit him,'' said Anna Manz of Cincinnati, whose
daughter sued over her husband's death in a construction accident.
   Lawyer Tom Alexander, who represents Derr Construction Co. of
Euless, Texas, agreed to allow Mrs. Manz, her daughter, Machelle
Parks, and their attorneys take their best shots at him.
   ``The clients are very pleased,'' said Alexander. ``He likes to
have a lawyer, so to speak, who will go to the mat for him.''
   Derr Construction was one of several defendants in a wrongful
death case brought by Mrs. Parks on behalf of her husband, Billy
Parks, 29, a foreman who was killed in a January 1987 construction
fall in Houston.
   Derr Construction was a subcontractor on the job, as was Baker
Concrete, Parks' employer.
   The various litigants agreed Sept. 26 to a roughly $3 million
settlement to be shared by all the defendants. Alexander, who had
sought numerous delays and postponements in the case, was not
involved in the negotiations. When he learned his partner had
offered that Derr pay a $50,000 share, he angrily refused to let
Derr pay anything.
   ``He was loud and he insisted that he wouldn't pay this,'' Mrs.
Manz said. ``He just kept really spouting off .... I really knew if
I could just sock him, it would be justified.''
   ``He was acting very pompous and was reneging on the
agreement,'' said Dale Friend, who represents Mrs. Parks, 26.
   Out of the arguing and protests came the suggestion that
Alexander take it on the chin.
   Their agreement was left out of the formal settlement approved
by Judge Davie Wilson, who didn't learn of the deal until later.
   ``This sounds like one that might only come out of Texas,'' the
judge said.
   Alexander, 59, said the beating will be worth it.
   ``I'll be glad to take it on the chin for my client,'' Alexander
said. ``They all got aggravated at me, but I refuse to pay nuisance
settlements. In the long run, it costs you money to pay little
rewards to people every time someone sues you.''
   Alexander said the family had won its settlement from the
responsible party, and that his client had little to do with the
liability.
   Friend wants the pummeling done at his firm's Christmas party
this year, but Alexander said April 1, 1990, April Fool's Day, is
more appropriate.
   Mrs. Parks said she doesn't believe the event will ever take
place.
   ``I think it was something (said to Alexander) to show him that
that was really rotten to renege on the deal. But it's not
something that's really going to be done,'' she said.
   But she added: ``It would be great fun because he was a real
creep _ he wasn't very compassionate and was very unprofessional.''

   Despite power outages that blacked out
computers and shut down printing presses, most newspapers in the
San Francisco Bay Area managed to publish Wednesday. Copies were
quickly snatched up by news-hungry residents.
   Both the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner
published slimmed-down editions, although there was no power at the
headquarters and printing plant they share at Fifth and Mission
Streets.
   ``HUNDREDS DEAD IN HUGE QUAKE'' was the front-page headline in
the morning Chronicle, which had three white ``Extras'' across the
top on a black background.
   The afternoon Examiner had a headline reading: ``7.0 quake stuns
Bay.'' A skyline over the masthead said ``EARTHQUAKE EXTRA.''
   The Chronicle told its readers that it managed to print its
16-page special editions at its Army Street printing plant and an
East Bay facility near Union City. The first eight pages were
devoted to earthquake coverage, with the rest consisting of stories
that had been set in type before the quake.
   The Chronicle's news accounts were placed on Macintosh computer
discs, using an emergency generator to power the computers.
   ``The Chronicle of Oct. 18, 1989, is a newspaper produced with a
heavy heart,'' Executive Editor William German said in a front-page
statement. ``The fact that it was produced at all was a mighty
feat.''
   The Tribune in Oakland published Wednesday morning, as did the
San Jose Mercury News. A morning final edition of the Mercury News
included a special 12-page earthquake section and a front page
headline that read ``MASSIVE QUAKE: 150 Die in Seconds of Horror.''
   It was not clear how many copies the newspapers were able to
print.

   When word got out that the Socialist Party
was running Maria del Carmen Romero Lopez, a 42-year-old former
schoolteacher, for Parliament, the opposition cried foul and
likened her to Eva Peron and Imelda Marcos.
   Carmen Romero happens to be Mrs. Felipe Gonzalez, wife of
Spain's two-time prime minister who is running for re-election.
   Mrs. Romero, who uses her maiden name, was given the No. 3 spot
on her party's list for Cadiz, where seven of the current nine
deputies from the southern province are Socialists.
   Because of the system of proportioning parliamentary seats to
parties on the basis of their provincial votes, she is certain to
be elected.
   Mrs. Romero, mother of children aged 17, 16 and 10, has shunned
the limelight during her husband's seven years in office and rarely
accompanies him on official trips. She has not adopted any causes
or become involved in charitable work. She says Spain has only one
first lady, Queen Sofia, wife of King Juan Carlos.
   At the Socialist Party congress last year, she tossed red roses
at the Executive Committee that had just approved a 25 percent
minimum quota for women in party and government positions.
   Gonzalez has been noticably neutral about his wife's candidacy,
limiting himself to remarks about the ``lack of democratic
sentiment'' on the part of those who liken her to the wife of the
late Argentine leader Juan D. Peron. Although she never ran for
office, Eva Peron, also known as Evita, played a dominant political
role in Argentina in the 1940s until her death in 1952.
   Imelda Marcos also had an influential role in the Philippines
before her husband, the late Ferdinand E. Marcos, was ousted in
1986.
   Mrs. Romero says that as a member of Parliament she would
concentrate on issues related to women, education and youth
unemployment.
   Press response to her first campaign appearance Oct. 1 in the
town of Chiclana was less than enthusiastic.
   Jose Luis Guitierrez, a commentator for Diario 16, called her
political discourse ``outdated'' and her speaking voice ``not
exactly good.''
   In spite of her party's decision to promote women, Gutierrez
wrote, ``Carmen Romero is not just another woman and, for obvious
reasons, does not have the same rights and duties as other Spanish
women.''
   The feminist Lidia Falcon questioned Mrs. Romero's record and
says the invitation from the Cadiz branch of the Socialist Party to
run there seems more like ``an offer of an honorary presidency made
to queens and aristocrats than a recognition for past services.''
   But Cristina Almeida, a human rights attorney who is running for
Parliament on the opposition United Left ticket in Madrid, welcomed
Mrs. Romero's candidacy, saying she had ``all the right in the
world'' to seek office.

<HEAD>Author of `Black Station' Books Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter L. Farley, whose ``Black Stallion''
books stirred the imaginations of millions of young readers and was
the basis of an Academy Award-winning movie, died after suffering a
heart attack. He was 73.
   Farley, who was admitted to Sarasota Memorial Hospital on
Sunday, died Monday evening.
   Farley, whose books have been translated into 20 languages and
have sold more than 12 million copies, recently completed his 21st
novel in the ``Black Stallion'' series, said Jenny Fanelli, a
Random House editor who worked with Farley on two of his books.
   The author's last novel, ``The Young Black Stallion,'' written
with his son, Steven, is set for release in December, Fanneli said
Tuesday.
   ``My great love was, and still is, horses,'' Farley said in an
interview last year. ``I wanted a pony as much as any boy or girl
could possibly want anything, but I never owned one.''
   Farley, who had lived in Venice, Fla. since 1946, was born in
Syracuse, N.Y. He started writing ``The Black Stallion'' as a
child, using his experiences with an uncle who was a famed horse
trainer.
   The final manuscript of the novel was delivered to Random House
in 1941, when Farley was still a high school student in New York
City and about the same age as his 17-year-old hero, Alec Ramsay.
   Farley's romantic tale about a young boy stranded on a desert
island with a spirited horse brought him $1,000.
   After Army service, he attended Columbia University, then
returned to writing and horses. He produced 20 more books in the
``Black Stallion'' series and wrote 11 other books, including
shorter workers for younger children.
   ``What he captured best is a child's love for a horse,'' Fanelli
said. ``His own love of horses shines through his books.''
   ``The Black Stallion'' was made into a movie produced by Francis
Ford Coppola in 1979. Farley had refused dozens of previous movie
offers, fearing the story would be lost in the translation to film.
   The movie received two Academy Award nominations, and was
followed by a sequel, ``The Black Stallion Returns.''
   Farley's success enabled him to own many horses. He and his
wife, Rosemary, spent their summers in the hills of central
Pennsylvania, where they owned a farm at Earlville.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, two sons
and a brother.

<HEAD>Dustin Hoffman's Shylock Prepares for Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dustin Hoffman's Shylock on the London stage is
now a memory, leaving a legacy of mixed reviews, packed houses and
great expectations for Broadway, where he opens in December.
   Sir Peter Hall's production of Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of
Venice'' was the lone smash hit in an otherwise lackluster summer
for British drama. It opened June 1 at the Phoenix Theater for a
13-week run that was extended through Sept. 23.
   Hoffman as Shylock was a risky venture. It wasn't just a
question of ironing the New York inflections out of Hoffman's
voice, but of how the fastidious British theater-going public would
take to a Hollywood star attempting Shakespeare.
   ``I didn't quite know what it would be like. All I knew is I
would learn something,'' Hoffman said.
   Explaining the mixed reviews, he blamed the speed with which the
production was rushed onto the stage, due to his father's illness,
which forced him to spend time at his bedside in the United States.
   ``We opened in this play after 10 public performances, and my
performance for me was like those incisions you see from people
who've been operated on,'' he said in an August interview.
   ``You still see their fresh wounds and their stitches; now I'm
at a point where you can barely see the scars.''
   Shylock is the Jewish moneylender whose thirst for revenge
against Antonio (Leigh Lawson), the Venetian merchant of the title,
finds its match in the exactingly legalistic heiress, Portia
(Geraldine James).
   Hall, who directed the play, said that as an authentically
Jewish actor, Hoffman ``changed the part historically.''
   ```Merchant' seemed to me particularly right for him,'' Hall
said in an interview. ``Shylock is about the outsider, the man
coming into the society which he is foreign to, which was very much
Dustin's situation coming into an English theater company.''
   Assessing Hoffman's achievement toward the end of the London
run, Hall said: ``Shylock is wheeling and dealing and surviving,
and that's what Dustin seizes hold of. To me, he answers the
question, is Shylock comic or tragic, by saying he's both; he's a
man.''
   The Shylock character traditionally provokes the accusation that
Shakespeare was anti-Semitic, and anyone involved in staging ``The
Merchant of Venice'' knows how sensitively it must be handled.
   ``To have a Jewish actor play Shylock is mandatory in our age,''
said Hall. ``If you're going to talk about Jewishness, you'd better
do it from a position of integrity and knowledge, not ham acting.''
   Some of the play's success may have been due to renewed
enthusiasm for Shakespeare. But the real draw undoubtedly was
Hoffman, fresh from his second Academy Award for ``Rain Man,'' in a
play that marked both his British and his Shakespearean stage debut.
   Hoffman, who grew a beard for the show and shaved it off after
the last performance, eschewed above-the-title billing and appeared
half way down the cast list.
   But despite such modesty, the mixed reviews and a top ticket
price of 17.50 pounds ($28), expensive by London standards, the
play quickly sold out. Only the London mega-musicals such as
``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Aspects of Love'' sold as many
tickets.
   The play starts New York performances Dec. 4 at the 46th St.
Theater, with an opening on Dec. 19.
   Hall recalled that Hoffman first thought of playing Hamlet, but
was judged too old at 52. Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night,'' another
possibility, was shelved for want of a suitable Viola. The two then
hit on Shylock, one of Shakespeare's most controversial parts and
also surprisingly small in light of its importance. Shylock appears
in only five scenes.
   A planned out-of-town tryout in Bath was canceled because of
Hoffman's father's illness, and Hoffman's performance had to evolve
during the run. The opening, said co-star Geraldine James, was
``very rushed.''
   ``Dustin hit his peak in the middle of the run,'' she said in an
interview. ``He hadn't got the confidence at the beginning ... and
I think he might have gone too much the other way (towards the
end), playing too much into the audience.''
   She said she found his attitude anything but starry. ``He was so
generous, spiritually and literally; he wouldn't have his name over
the title and insisted on me having the last curtain call.''
   Julia Wilson-Dickson, the production's dialogue coach, admired
Hoffman as ``a fanatical worker, a seeker after the truth ... but
perhaps a little more free in his enthusiasm'' than most British
actors.
   It fell to her to turn his ``dawg'' into ``dog,'' and ``bawnd''
into ``bond,'' and his performance over time got ``simpler, more
straightforward, and physically stronger vocally,'' she said in an
interview.
   ``The actual conception of it is exactly the same, but the
practical delivery has been honed greatly.''
   Could Hoffman tackle other Shakespeare parts? ``Absolutely,''
Wilson-Dickson said. ``I've told him so about 50 times _ and he's
definitely humble enough to ask.''

   In a campaign that's given new meaning to
``stretching the truth,'' both candidates for New Jersey governor
are running TV ads that portray their opponents as Pinocchio, whose
nose gets longer with every lie.
   ``It has not exactly been an intellectual tea party,'' Kenneth
Connolly, campaign manager for Republican James Courter, said this
week.
   The name-calling between Courter and Democrat James Florio has
been denounced by popular two-term Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean
and by newspaper editorials.
   Florio hit the huge New York and Philadelphia television markets
this month with commercials featuring Courter's nose getting longer
and longer as a narrator ticks off a series of his supposed lies
and misleading statements.
   Courter and his advisers liked the idea so much that they, too,
employed the wooden character from C. Collodi's ``The Adventures of
Pinocchio.''
   Courter's commercial showed millions of viewers the faces of
both congressmen. Florio's regular nose grows longer and longer,
while Courter's enlarged proboscis simultaneously shrinks back to
its regular shape.
   ``The reason we ran the Pinnochio spot is that Jim Florio on TV
called Jim Courter a liar. You simply cannot let that charge go
unanswered. We were forced to respond,'' Connolly said.
   Richard Sinding, president of the Center for Analysis of Public
Issues at Princeton University, called the campaign for governor
the dirtiest he has seen.
   Kean, who is barred by state law from seeking a third
consecutive four-year term, predicted the negative campaigning will
``depress the electorate. People will say neither of them are any
good.''
   Jon Shure, a Florio spokesman, defended the opening Pinocchio
ad, which blasted Courter's record in civil rights and
environmental protection.
   ``What's negative in this campaign is Jim Courter's record,''
Shure said. ``That's what our ad shows. That was an
attention-getting advice, a somewhat humorous way to make a serious
point.''
   The Courter campaign apparently did not enjoy it.
   ``Florio lied,'' the narrator says in the Republican's return
volley.
   ``Poor Jim Florio,'' the narrator concludes as Florio's nose
stretches into Pinocchian proportions. ``Even the newspapers say he
has an ethical cloud hanging over his head.''
   Courter is running an uphill battle against Florio in November's
election. Recent polls indicate he is trailing by between 14 and 23
points.
   At the end of the classic children's tale, Pinocchio turned into
a real boy.
   ``It's not clear at what stage in his adult life he moved to New
Jersey and decided to run for governor,'' said Adrian Heffern, a
political columnist for The Asbury Park Press. ``There are
suspicions that his consultants are the Fox and the Cat who led him
astray the first time.''

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with eight grafs to UPDATE with Tug Fork cresting, 150

   Heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry triggered
flooding in the Appalachians Tuesday, closing roads and schools and
forcing evacuations in West Virginia and Kentucky. Rain fell across
much of the rest of the East.
   Up to 4 inches of rain fell on southern West Virginia. Schools
were closed in four counties because rising water threatened to
block school buses.
   Flooding on the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River, along the West
Virginia-Kentucky line, would be the first test of the West
Williamson floodwall, which was dedicated just this summer. A
floodwall protecting downtown Williamson is less than 60 percent
complete.
   The Tug Fork rose 3 feet an hour Tuesday afternoon. The river
crested 6 feet above its banks at Matewan early in the evening and
was expected to crest 3 feet above flood stage at Williamson
overnight, the National Weather Service reported.
   Floodwaters swept away an unoccupied house along the river in
Boone County, officials said.
   People from low-lying rural areas near Matewan and in Williamson
were asked to leave their homes, officials said. About 150 people
were evacuated.
   In southeastern Kentucky, where 4 to 6 inches of rain fell in
the 18 hours ended at 1 p.m. Tuesday, many roads were flooded or
blocked by mudslides, the weather service said. Fast-rising creeks
forced evacuations in Pike, Floyd, Clay and Jackson counties.
   More than 760 students and faculty at McDowell Elementary and
High School saw Frasure and Left Beaver creeks spill over their
banks and flood school buildings with up to 3 feet of water early
Tuesday.
   Rain, showers and occasional thunderstorms during the afternoon
extended over much of New England, New York state, northern and
eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, much of Virginia, West
Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Illinois.
   Showers and thunderstorms also reached from western Georgia
across the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, southern Mississippi,
southeastern Louisiana and along the lower Texas Gulf Coast.
   Scattered snow showers fell from north-central Wyoming to
south-central Colorado, but no measurable amounts were reported
during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT. At dawn there was an inch of
snow on the ground in Denver; Cheyenne, Wyo., and Limon, Colo.
   Freeze warnings through Wednesday morning were posted for
sections of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Overnight
lows near freezing were expected in the Texas Panhandle and
northeastern New Mexico.
   By contrast, a record high temperature for the date was set in
Cape Hatteras, N.C., where it was 83 degrees. Records were also set
in Orlando, Fla., where it was 93 and Jacksonville, Fla., where it
was 91.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Custer, S.D., to 98 at Palm Springs, Calif. Tuesday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 11 in West Yellowstone, Mont.

   Thousands of stranded office workers
mingled with the homeless in San Francisco's darkened streets
Tuesday night as a pitch-black night, a night of fear and
festiveness, fell over this quake-damaged city by the bay.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through the darkness and over glass-strewn streets as a few stars
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire raging in the Marina
district.
   An occasional office building running on emergency generators
stood out in the blackness. Electrically powered trolleys formed
little empty holes of light where they stalled, emergency blinkers
winking on and off. Car headlights criss-crossed, pedestrians
dodging among them.
   And desperate people lined up 20 deep at pay telephones to call
home.
   ``Answer! Dammit!'' Jeff Darling yelled into one phone as he
tried to reach his wife and child across San Francisco Bay in
Berkeley after the earthquake.
   When the phone went unanswered, Darling dropped the receiver and
sobbed uncontrollably. ``I've got to know, I've got to know. What
happened?'' He said his house was undergoing renovation and he
feared that some of the supports may have been undermined by the
work.
   But on other streets, the scene seemed festive. Some fireworks
were set off, and children played outside.
   ``People are out in the streets, and it looks like a huge parade
is about to come down the street,'' said Texas State Treasurer Ann
Richards, who was walking in downtown San Francisco when the deadly
quake hit just after 5 p.m.
   But she added, ``It's really frightening.''
   After dark, with power out, people gathered in candle-lit bars
and restaurants. Groups of 10 or 20 stood on sidewalks downtown,
listening on large radios to reports on the quake. Others strolled
in a surreal promenade in the darkness. Buses were jammed with
riders, but no one appeared to panic.
   People sat outside dingy hotels, on the stoops of apartment
houses, on curbs. And thoughts turned to worrying about where to go
for food and water.
   In San Francisco's Haight-Fillmore district, cracks were visible
on some stoops and buildings, some in the stucco and some
structural. Many buildings in the neighborhood are Victorian-style
homes that survived the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906.
   John Kunze, 26, of Mountain View, said he was on an overpass
driving home from work when he ``noticed my car swaying back and
forth and I thought I had a tire blowout. It was just a scary,
eerie feeling.
   ``Then I noticed telephone polls swinging back and forth and I
knew it was an earthquake.''
   At Candlestick Park, the capacity crowd stood frozen for a
moment but cheered when the quake passed. The scoreboard and
electricity to the park were knocked out. Beer cups tumbled from
the shelves at one concession stand.
   Jim Van Sickle, who lives about 60 miles east of San Francisco,
said plates were knocked off his fireplace mantle by the earthquake.
   Asked his age, Van Sickle said, ``I was 52 before the
earthquake, but now I'm 82.''
   Downtown's thousands of office workers were left with no major
transportation routes to homes across the water in East Bay areas.
   A section of the top deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed onto the lower road. The subway was shut down.
Large sections of the two-tiered Nimitz Freeway collapsed onto the
lower roadway.
   Cooperation and innovation sprung up amid the paralysis, however.
   Motorists gave rides to people trying to get across town. The
owner of one office building allowed reporters to file news stories
via a facsimile machine's phone line, although the machine itself
did not work.
   Tempers flared occasionally at the lines for telephones. At one,
a shoving match broke out between a man in line and a man on the
phone. The two were pulled apart and the people in line agreed to
talk no more than three minutes each.

   President Bush said Tuesday night he would
provide federal assistance to earthquake victims in California and
a spokesman said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner would
``land as close as he can get'' to assess the damage.
   The president was informed of the earthquake after addressing a
Republican governors' dinner. He paused outside his limousine and
told reporters at a distance that ``the federal government will do
everything it can to help.''
   Skinner was flying overnight to California. Military officials
mobilized two National Guard units to aid California rescue
efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) established
a command center at its headquarters in Washington. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``they will coordinate all the
information and dispatch of whatever support they can provide.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said he had contacted the
office of California Gov. George Deukmejian. The governor was in
Frankfort, West Germany and Sununu authorized a U.S. Air Force
plane to fly Deukmejian immediately back to California.
   Sununu also phoned Vice President Dan Quayle, who was visiting
San Diego. ``The vice president was aware of the earthquake. There
was no experience of it that far south, however,'' Fitzwater said.
   Quayle was to return to Washington ``at about midnight,'' said
Fitzwater. ``He wanted to return, was scheduled to return, and we
saw no reason to suggest a change of plans.'' An hour later,
however, the White House said Quayle would remain overnight in
California and confer with Skinner on Wednesday.
   Skinner was being flown aboard a special military aircraft and
was to ``land as close as he can get,'' according to Fitzwater. He
said Marilyn Quayle was accompanying Skinner and was ``going out to
be part of the assessment team.'' She has made disaster relief a
special interest as the vice president's wife.
   Several Bay-area members of Congress also were aboard the flight
after calls from their home districts. ``There is extensive
damage,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta ``People are frightened out
there,'' said Rep. Don Edwards.
   National Guard spokesman Dan Donohue said two California Air
National Guard units were being activated.
   Donohue said the 129th Air Rescue and Recovery Group from
Moffett Naval Air Station and the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing at
Van Nuys and Channel Island would send helicopters, rescue and
recovery aircraft and cargo planes to the San Francisco area.
   ``It's a given they will get whatever disaster aid is called
for,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Sununu had ``talked to officials at Department of
Defense, and they will be prepared to help in any way they can,
coordinating again through FEMA.''
   Fitzwater said FEMA would keep Sununu informed. No top officials
planned to stay at the White House throughout the night, Fitzwater
said, and the president got his final briefing of the evening from
Sununu at 10:45 p.m.
   Reporters learned of the earthquake while Bush was just
beginning his address at the ballroom in the Capital Hilton, a few
blocks from the White House.
   Fitzwater described how Bush was informed after he finished his
speech: ``We handed him the note just as he was coming off and he
read it and just said _ mentioned something to Barbara, `Look at
this. It looks like a very serious problem. Do we know anything
more about it?'...
   Said Bush: ``John (Sununu) called the governor's office and got
some information there. The governor's out of the country but we're
beginning to get a lot of information back here and obviously the
federal government will do everything that it possibly can to help.
But at this point we're just assessing _ ''
   White House domestic adviser Roger Porter, informed by ABC-TV
correspondent Brit Hume, darted out of the room to gather
information. Sununu, who was also at the dinner along with Skinner,
five other Cabinet members and numerous other top administration
officials, also left the ballroom to try to contact the governor's
office in California.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. appealed
to the nation Thursday night not to try telephoning
earthquake-wracked San Francisco.
   The company said it blocked part of a flood of calls into the
area so San Franciscans could call out.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said 1 million attempted long
distance calls were recorded on the AT&amp;T network at 9 p.m., roughly
2{ times the normal volume.
   He said network managers in 12 locations applied controls to
block calls into the San Francisco area so there would be circuits
for people to call out.
   Those controls were still in place late Tuesday night. ``We'll
play it by ear'' in deciding when to remove them, Linnen said.
   ``We are urging people elsewhere to not call into that area so
we can devote more of our circuits to what we're trying to do _
give priority to calls coming out of that affected area,'' he said,
and this request will apply until further notice.
   ``The veterans up there in Bedminister N.J. (AT&amp;T's control
center for its long-distance network) tell me they have never seen
anything like they have seen tonight in monitoring the nationwide
network,'' Linnen said.
   Some callers from elsewhere in the nation could not place calls
to countries on the Pacific Rim because the AT&amp;T switching center
at Sacramento, Calif., which handles those calls, was jammed with
calls fro San Francisco.
   ``We have asked the foreign telephone administrations in Pacific
Rim countries to block calls coming into the Bay area in order to
take some of the load off,'' said Linnen.
   AT&amp;T handles about 70 percent of the nation's long-distance
calls.

<HEAD>Key GOP Seat Up For Grabs in 5th Mspi District</HEAD>

   State Sen. Gene Taylor won an overwhelming
victory over Republican Tom Anderson in a special congressional
election Tuesday, giving the Democrats all five of Mississippi's
U.S. House seats for the first time in 17 years.
   With all 372 precincts reporting in the race to pick a successor
to the late U.S. Rep. Larkin Smith, Taylor had 83,093 votes, or 65
percent, to 44,430, or 35 percent for Anderson, a veteran
Washington aide.
   The GOP, which holds both of Mississippi's U.S. Senate seats,
lost its only House seat, which it had held since 1972. Smith, a
Republican, died in a small plane crash in August.
   Taylor carried all but one of the 12 counties in the 5th
District in Mississippi's southeastern corner, which includes the
Gulf Coast and the cities of Biloxi, Gulfport and Hattiesburg.
   ``I'm kind of bewildered by the numbers,'' Taylor, 36, said in a
telephone interview from Biloxi on Tuesday night. ``We hoped to
win, but we're overwhelmed.''
   Taylor, a conservative, said residents of the district ``can
expect someone who is going to go to bat. Above all, I hope they
come to expect honest government.'' He said he would ask to be
sworn in next Tuesday.
   Anderson conceded defeat around 8:30 p.m., saying he hadn't had
enough time to build a successful campaign.
   ``We came from nowhere, we worked hard,'' he said. ``It's been
the longest 50 days of my life.''
   Taylor represented Bay St. Louis in the state Senate. Anderson,
43, was a longtime chief of staff to U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, who held
the seat for the Republicans for 16 years before going on to the
Senate. Smith defeated Taylor for the post last year.
   The GOP showed the importance they place on the seat in the
amount of money Anderson spent, a campaign appearance by President
Bush and Lott's visibility. Anderson spent about $500,000, roughly
five times Taylor's spending.
   ``That district is important to us not because it has been in
Republican hands for so long,'' said state Democratic Chairman Ed
Cole. ``That's one of the reasons.
   ``But that district represents the best of what Mississippi has
to offer in that it has the strongest economy, the highest per
capita income, the highest technology base and the greatest
population growth in the last 10 years.''
   In the primary Oct. 3, Taylor got 42 percent of the vote and
Anderson 37 percent. Attorney General Mike Moore, a Democrat, got
21 percent of the vote and was eliminated.
   Authorities found Smith and his pilot Aug. 14 in wreckage of
their single-engine plane. Smith, a popular law enforcement
official on the coast, was returning from opening ceremonies at the
Dixie World Series in Hattiesburg.
   Tuesday's election was the seventh special congressional
election this year. Of the previous six, Democrats won four,
Republicans two.
   There is an eighth such election scheduled for Nov. 7, in Texas
to fill the seat of the late Mickey Leland, who also died in a
plane crash.

<TEXT>
   ABC's coverage of the World Series helped end
NBC's record 68-straight weeks at the top of the A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings.
   ABC moved into first place for last week with its coverage of
the first two games between the San Francisco Giants and the
Oakland Athletics.
   NBC, which has dominated the ratings for the past four years,
was second last week, followed by CBS.
   One of the previous 68 weeks included a tie between NBC and CBS
when that network telecast ``Lonesome Dove'' earlier this year.
   Oddly enough, neither of the first two games Saturday and Sunday
made the top 10 or even won the night. But on Saturday, for
instance, the game raised ABC to an average rating of 15.0 compared
with its usual 7.0.
   ABC also made a strong showing with its regular programming.
``Roseanne'' was first and its three other Tuesday night comedies,
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``The Wonder Years'' and ``Chicken Soup,''
were all in the top 10.
   Saturday's opening game of the World Series tied for 18th place
with ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' Sunday's game finished 16th.
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, expressed
regret at the loss, and said, ``I hope we start a new streak soon.''
   ABC won the week with an average prime-time rating of 14.8. NBC
had 13.9 according to CBS, 13.8 according to ABC and 14.0 according
to NBC. CBS was third with 12.5. The raw data is provided by
Nielsen and is subject to interpretation by the networks, although
different figures generally come only when programs such as ball
games run live in prime time in one part of the country and in
fringe time in another part of the country.
   A ratings point represents the percentage of the 92.1 million
television homes.
   NBC's loss is partly due to the fact that the baseball playoffs
did not go for a sixth or seventh game. NBC's promotion for the
past week had been based on the assumption the playoffs would go to
seven games.
   Here are last week's top 10 programs: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``A Different World,''
ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?,'' NBC's ``The
Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ABC's ``Chicken Soup''
and NBC's ``Dear John.''
   ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' is the highest-rated new show and the
second highest new show was ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' which
tied for 18th place with Saturday's opening game. ``Chicken Soup''
is comedian Jackie Mason's first series. ``Doogie Howser'' is the
first series from producer-creator Steven Bochco's multi-series
deal with ABC.
   NBC's ``Mancuso, FBI,'' the last new series to premiere, came in
56th.
   The other new shows: CBS' ``Major Dad'' 32nd, ABC's ``Family
Matters'' 36th, CBS' ``Rescue: 911'' 45th, CBS' ``Island Son''
47th, CBS' ``People Next Door'' 52nd, ABC's ``Young Riders'' 55th,
NBC's ``Nutt House'' 58th, ABC's ``Life Goes On'' 59th, NBC's
``Hardball'' 60th, NBC's ``Baywatch,'' NBC's ``Sister Kate,'' and
CBS' ``Wolf,'' in a tie with NBC's ``Quantum Leap'' for 61st, CBS'
``Top of the Hill'' 65th, ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' 66th, CBS'
``Peaceable Kingdom'' 72nd, and CBS' ``Snoops'' 73rd.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married...With Children,'' in 51st
place, was its highest-rated show.
   ABC had the highest-rated evening news show with a 9.9 rating.
CBS had a 9.3 and NBC 9.0.
   CBS' ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung'' was the lowest-rated
show among the three networks. Here are the bottom five: NBC's
``Magical World of Disney,'' CBS' ``Peaceable Kingdom,'' CBS'
``Snoops,'' ``CBS' ``Tour of Duty'' and CBS' ``Saturday Night with
Connie Chung.''

<HEAD>`Beside Herself,' A New Play by Joe Pintauro, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Beware of plays that include talking bears _
even if they are only part of a dream.
   In ``Beside Herself,'' which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's
Circle Repertory Company, Mary, an aging, lonely widow, hears the
voice of her long-dead first love who happened to be her husband's
brother. He speaks through a furry creature that wanders into
Mary's kitchen and sounds a little like James Cagney with a head
cold.
   But the bear is just a fleeting vision conjured up by Mary. She
has more extended visits from her past self _ as a young girl, as a
teen-ager and as a woman in her 20s. You can tell they are from
long ago because the smoke machine kicks in, flooding the floor of
Mary's island home with fog, and the background music by Jonathan
Brielle turns all tinkly.
   Playwright Joe Pintauro has written a memory play in which talk
of the past nearly drowns the present _ and the audience. What
saves much of the evening is the fine acting of Lois Smith as Mary
and, in a supporting role, William Hurt as a UPS delivery man she
tries to befriend.
   They give a credibility to a play awash in symbolism and
unconvincing dialogue between the woman and her other personas.
Pintauro also has a fascination with wounded or dying animals. A
lot of the awkward conversation seems to return to the raccoons
which keep getting hit on the highway next to Mary's house. Are
they metaphorical stand-ins for the poor woman?
   There's a giddy vulnerability to Smith's performance, and she
undergoes a remarkable physical transformation _ from dowdy old
lady to understanding older woman _ between the play's two acts.
   Hurt, returning as a member of the Circle Rep company for the
first time in seven years, plays against his blond good looks. At
first, he's almost unrecognizable, sporting long sideburns, a Fu
Manchu mustache and a baseball cap pulled down over his eyes. And
he affects a credible blue-collar accent that is a fine
counterpoint to Smith's more educated way of speaking.
   Their scenes together are warm and funny, particularly when
Smith tries flirting with the younger man and he resists, but not
too hard. Melissa Joan Hart, Calista Flockhart and Susan Bruce
adequately handle the minimal demands of Mary's past lives, while
Edward Seamon makes a game effort as an older delivery man and in a
second, thankless role, as that hapless bear.
   Set designer John Lee Beatty has created a charming rustic cabin
dappled in autumn colors by lighting designer by Dennis Parichy.
   Director John Bishop handles the quiet, realistic moments of the
play the best. When Mary's other selves scamper around the stage,
he resorts to that hokey music and the smoke machine. But they
don't obliterate the quiet conversation between the older woman and
the younger man. It's too bad the two of them couldn't be on stage
all the time, but those three ghosts keep getting in the way.

<HEAD>Report: Soviets Change Attitude Toward Human Rights, But Abuses Persist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights abuses in the Soviet Union have
declined dramatically but people still are persecuted for their
political and religious beliefs, Amnesty International said in a
report today.
   The human rights group said its list of Soviet citizens in
prison for non-violent exercise of their human rights shrank from
600 three years ago to about 90 in July, and would have been lower
but for further arrests.
   But ``despite this clear trend toward reform, the human rights
picture in the U.S.S.R. is deeply confusing,'' the report said. For
example, Amnesty said, new decrees have been issued that restrict
political activity.
   An Amnesty delegation was allowed into the Soviet Union for the
first time in March and found that ``the Soviet perspective on
human rights has shifted dramatically since 1986,'' the report said.
   ``The most promising prospect for long-term reform is a major
review of law ... apparently aimed at bringing Soviet law into line
with international standards,'' it said.
   For the first time, the report said, Soviet authorities are
freely discussing human rights issues and acknowledging them to be
an international issue, not merely a domestic matter.
   The Soviet Union hopes to hold the Helsinki Conference on Human
Rights in Moscow in 1991.
   Amnesty said that of the 600 prisoners of conscience held three
years ago, 337 were released early and another 79 were freed from
psychiatric hospitals, where some had spent 15 years or more
against their will.
   ``Most of these 416 people were prosecuted for expressing
non-conformist opinions, or for their religious activities. Some
had been arrested for trying to leave the U.S.S.R.,'' it said.
   ``They make up the largest single group of prisoners of
conscience to have been freed since the 1950s. Political arrests
have also fallen noticeably since 1986,'' it said.
   Despite the change in attitude toward human rights, Amnesty said
it was concerned about what it called new moves to curb political
activity. It cited a ruling in April that effectively bans
electioneering for radical change, and another in July restricting
rights of assembly.
   A new centrally controlled police force with extensive powers
was set up in July 1988 under a decree that gives the authorities
``unrestrained powers to ban or break up peaceful assemblies,'' the
report said. ``On more than one occasion since July 1988 they have
been used for this purpose.''
   The law on public gatherings is available in writing and
decisions on applications for public meetings have to be given five
days in advance. But authorities may ban meetings as
unconstitutional even where they pose no threat to public order,
and there is no right of appeal, Amnesty said.
   There also had been new arrests, so that when the Amnesty
delegation visited Moscow it had a list of 100 detainees, including
25 conscientious objectors to military service, 25 people in
psychiatric institutions and about 30 imprisoned for non-violent
nationalist activity, the report said.
   The rest had been convicted of trying to leave the Soviet Union
illegally or of criminal offenses ``that appeared to be false or
politically motivated,'' the report said.
   It said 19 people whose cases were raised by the delegation were
subsequently released, including 12 Armenian nationalists who are
awaiting trial.
   Since the delegation came home it has learned of new arrests of
conscientious objectors and nationalists in the Moldavian Republic,
and more cases of long-term psychiatric incarceration have emerged,
the report said.
   Also, it said, some of those freed were given secret pardons
without having their convictions quashed, so that they have
difficulty getting work and housing.
   On freedom of expression, Amnesty said it was heartened by a new
approach to individual cases that has led to the release of 221
people jailed for ``anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,'' leaving
just two awaiting freedom. It said it learned of no new
prosecutions in 1988.

   The president of the city's school board
said he erred in allowing university researchers ask sixth graders
personal questions about their sexual development and emotional
well-being.
   Richard L. Lockard, president of the Altoona Area School Board,
apologized publicly for the survey, conducted by Penn State's
College of Health and Human Development to identify adolescent
concerns that may contribute to depression among youth.
   After a board meeting Monday, Lockard said he found the survey
``disturbing'' and asked that board members receive copies of any
future surveys.
   Among the questions asked were, ``Have your breasts begun to
grow?'' and ``Do you think the timing of your physical sexual
development was any earlier or later than most boys (girls) your
age?''
   Elizabeth Koelle, the mother a child enrolled in an Altoona
school, said she asked for the apology because many children were
disturbed and offended by the survey.

   OK, downtown Bristol isn't Fifth Avenue.
But merchants were still plenty miffed when they found out the city
was organizing a shopping trip to take residents to Massachusetts.
   ``I am totally outraged,'' fumed Frank Johnson, president of the
Bristol Chamber of Commerce. ``I cannot express my outrage.''
   Now, Fall River isn't exactly Rodeo Drive, either. But the
southeastern Massachusetts city boasts more than 100 outlet stores,
enough to persuade Bristol's parks and recreation department to
organize a bus excursion for Nov. 4.
   For City Council member William Stortz, the trip transcended bad
politics.
   ``It is sinful to encourage and assist local people to shop
out-of-town,'' Stortz said.
   Mayor John J. Leone said it is too late to cancel the trip _ the
bus is already full.

   San Francisco's killer earthquake sent a
televised jolt throughout the nation Tuesday as the three major
networks and CNN scrambled to send live and videotape reports from
the scene.
   For network news staffs, it was controlled pandemonium. At times
CNN augmented its own coverage with video feeds from three
stations, all of whom it credited on the air. The stations were
independent KTVU-TV, and two NBC affiliates, KCRA-TV in Sacramento
and KRON-TV in San Francisco.
   Because ABC had planned to air the third game of the World
Series from Candlestick Park, it had the largest staff and
electronic gear at the scene. With all-sports ESPN, which it
co-owns, it aired some of the widest, earliest live and taped video
coverage of the quake's aftermath.
   The ABC Sports blimp provided early live and taped aerial
pictures of a one-block fire in San Francisco, a shattered highway,
and the broken upper section of the Bay Bridge. ABC Sports reporter
Al Michaels, at an ABC control truck at Candlestick Park, helped
describe the scenes.
   At one point, ESPN, which was to cover the World Series game but
wasn't broadcasting it when the tremor struck, showed a live,
quaking picture of the field at Candlestick Park as an aftershock
hit.
   ESPN reporter Bob Ley, describing his initial move to leave the
park after the quake, reported that San Francisco Giants manager
Roger Craig ``was right behind me. It was scary.''
   Although all-news CNN got the first jump on the story for cable
viewers, ABC's Michael's had been on the air when the quake hit,
doing a pre-game report at Candlestick Park.
   The ABC picture turned to static, a still slide for the World
Series appeared, then ABC cut to the series, ``Roseanne.'' Then, at
8:10 p.m. EDT, an off-screen announcer said there had been a
``major quake'' in the San Francisco area.
   CBS anchor Dan Rather, in a ``flash booth'' for bulletins in New
York, began his first report, lasting one minute, at 8:21 p.m.. He
was followed two minutes later by ABC's Washington-based
``Nightline'' anchor, Ted Koppel.
   NBC's man at the quake scene, Bob Jamieson, wound up trapped in
San Francisco traffic after leaving Candlestick Park. He had to
report by cellular telephone from his car.
   Two of the networks, CBS and ABC, signed off coverage after
12:30 a.m. EDT, with CBS the first to go, returning to ``The Pat
Sajak Show.'' ABC's Koppel signed off at 12:40 a.m. EDT.
   However, Rather returned with a startling update shortly after
that, reporting that as many as 200 persons were killed in the
quake.
   Although NBC's continuous coverage went past 1 a.m. EDT
Wednesday, it was was the slowest off the mark earlier. A staff
member said its coverage started at 8:40 p.m. EDT Tuesday with a
bulletin by Burbank-based correspondent Keith Morrison.
   Eight minutes later, Mary Alice Williams anchored for NBC from
New York, but without the pictures that ABC and CNN already were
airing. She said that NBC's TV signal from San Francisco had been
temporarily knocked out by the quake.
   Shortly after 9 p.m., anchor Tom Brokaw succeeded her, with NBC
airing its first live shots from San Francisco.
   All three networks relied on live and taped video pictures and
interviews from their San Francisco affiliates, KGO-TV for ABC,
KPIX-TV for CBS and KRON-TV for NBC, with ABC having more of its
own coverage on the air.
   During its coverage, ABC illustrated with tape footage what it
said was the gallows humor of some fans at Candlestick Park. It
showed several persons holding a paper banner that said: ``The
Sleeping Giants Have Awakened.''
   Several times during the night, NBC and CNN simultaneously aired
the same videotape footage that KRON, NBC's affiliate, had made of
the fire and quake damage from a helicopter and on the ground. CNN
gave an on-air visual credit to the station each time.
   Rather said in an interview late Tuesday that he was at the CBS
Broadcast Center here when first word of the quake came in.
   ``Our initial thought was,`How big is it?' '' he said. ``Then it
was, `Let's go, let's go on the air at least with a bulletin.' I
remember thinking, `I hope it's not the big one.' ''

   Schoolgirl Sarah York says her pen pal, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, told her during her vacation in Panama that
he ``wants peace'' with the United States.
   The seventh-grader from Negaunee arrived in Miami on Tuesday
where U.S. Customs officials seized some candy she was bringing
back, said her mother, Pauline York. Sarah and her father, Michael,
then traveled on to Michigan.
   Sarah, 11, and her father went to the Central American country
days after Noriega's defense forces quashed a coup.
   ``I wanted to go to see for myself,'' she said in Miami. ``I see
a country that really wants peace with the U.S.''
   She said she visited Noriega on Oct. 11.
   ``He told me he wanted peace, and the U.S. to be friends without
one country trying to manipulate the other ... without making
Panama another U.S.,'' Sarah said.
   ``I've heard he's a Buddhist, a bigot, a bisexual,'' her father
said of the Panamanian leader. ``I've heard everything from you
people (the media), and he's not.''
   Sarah said she also spent time fishing and swimming with other
Panamanian friends she met last October when she visited the
country as Noriega's guest.
   Sarah began writing Noriega in March 1988, shortly after he was
indicted in the United States on drug-trafficking charges.
   Editorials condemning the trip and her friendship with Noriega
appeared during her visit. Rep. Bob Davis, R-Mich., said Sarah's
red-carpet treatment in Panama was embarrassing for the United
States.

   The Cambria Iron Co., the country's
leading producer of steel rails 120 years ago, was designated a
national historic landmark.
   Federal, state and local government officials and
representatives of Bethlehem Steel Corp., which is a successor of
Cambria Iron, gathered in Bethlehem's lower works Tuesday to
dedicate the remaining iron company buildings and the entire
Johnstown Plant.
   Cambria Iron was renowned for its technological innovations and
the manufacture of iron and steel rail.
   ``We draw only the most significant historic sites to consider
as national historic landmarks,'' said Jerry Rogers, an associate
director for the National Park Service.
   Officials for the park service and Bethlehem stressed that
Cambria's impact extended beyond such technical innovations as the
three-high rolling mill and first steel-rail production in the
United States. The company also trained a generation of steel
innovators and helped to shape late-19th century industrial society.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Oppose Proposed Timber Traffic Through Yellowstone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New National Park Service Director James
Ridenour faces his first big test among environmentalists as he
ponders whether to allow about 20,000 truckloads of timber to go to
mill through Yellowstone Park.
   ``If he does the wrong thing, he'll see us in court,'' said
Steve Whitney of the Wilderness Society.
   Federal law prohibits commercial operations in the parks, except
in emergencies, Whitney said.
   National parks spokesman George Berklacy said Interior
Department lawyers are reviewing the matter. Yellowstone Park
Superintendent Robert Barbee is due in Washington on Thursday to
discuss the problem with Ridenour.
   The timber, in national forests bordering Yellowstone, amounts
to about 40 million board feet from trees that were partially
burned when fire blazed out of control in the park last year.
   Anxious to get rid of the wood to speed new tree growth, the
U.S. Forest Service sold the timber to Brand-S Lumber Co. in
Livingston, Mont., for about $1 per 1,000 board feet.
   Brand-S, the closest lumber mill to the burned forests, is about
100 miles away _ if you drive through Yellowstone.
   ``We could go around the park, but it would cost more money,''
said Doug Crandall, Brand-S manager.
   It's about 75 miles farther to drive around the park, Crandall
said, adding that that route is a more difficult pass through the
mountains and is not cleared during the winter.
   Hoping for approval soon from the National Parks, Brand-S is
cutting down trees and piling up timber.
   ``We have about half a million board feet cut,'' said Crandall.
Leaving a dead tree standing diminishes its value because of
deterioration, he said.
   ``I know the Wilderness Society is concerned about a bad
precedent, but these circumstances are unusual and abnormal _ a
once in a lifetime occurrence,'' Crandall said.
   Crandall said his company has promised to repair any damage
caused by the trucks, but that doesn't satisfy the Wilderness
Society.
   ``We will challenge any effort to haul through the national
parks,'' said Michael Scott, Northern Rockies regional director for
the society.
   The trucks would go through an important grizzly bear habitat,
he said, adding that the potential damage to the bears and other
wildlife could not be repaired with dollars.
   ``A park is supposed to be a place apart from the normal
commerce of the world,'' said Scott. ``It is not designed to be a
throughway from commercial operations.''
   Berklacy said Ridenour will rely heavily on Barbee's
recommendation, which a spokeswoman at Yellowstone said has not yet
been made. Barbee was not available for comment.
   ``If he (Ridenour) errs he will err on the side of environmental
concerns,'' said Berklacy. ``At this point, there is some question
about legality. He has questions about impacts on the roads and
visitor activity and the wildlife.''
   Both Whitney and his assistant at the Wilderness Society, Brian
Culhane, say ``a new breeze is blowing at Interior'' since the
Reagan administration appointees left office, but they are
withholding judgment on Ridenour to see whether his actions match
his words.
   ``The rhetoric is good,'' said Culhane, citing a recent Ridenour
speech in which the director told park officials to more actively
protect the parks against external threats.
   Culhane said Ridenour's decision on hauling timber in
Yellowstone will be the first major test.
   ``We're talking about the world's first national park,'' he
said. ``If we don't start with Yellowstone, where are we going to?''

<HEAD>Facing Constricted Budget, School Board Takes Chance at Lottery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most folks buying tickets for a shot at a
$40 million lottery daydream about mansions and yachts, but nine
Holyoke residents have a different hope _ ending their school
district's financial crisis.
   The nine members of the city's school committee anted up $1 each
to play this week's Mass Millions game.
   ``We thought it was an excellent idea,'' member Bill Collamore
said Tuesday. ``It got a lot of people worked up and we're very
happy.''
   The idea surfaced at Monday night's school committee meeting. A
member who works for the Massachusetts Lottery Commission, and
therefore cannot play it, suggested that the board buy a few
tickets and then have them notarized so that winnings would go to
Holyoke schools.
   Members immediately started digging into their pockets to come
up with the money for the $1 tickets.
   Odds against winning are more than 9 million to one, but
Collamore said Holyoke schools need any help they can get.
   ``You know the city of Holyoke is in dire straits for money. Our
school system is in really bad shape,'' he said.
   Because of state budget cuts, the School Department had to trim
$10 million from its budget request this year, getting $29 million.
That meant laying off 107 people and cutting some programs, such as
music, Collamore said.
   The school committee joins millions of people hoping for the big
prize. Last week, the lottery commission did $11.5 million in
sales, spokesman Dave Ellis said Tuesday. There was no winner
Friday and sales are expected to be about $15 million this week.
   If the School Committee should win in Friday's drawing, the
expected jackpot would be $1 million more than the original budget
request, Collamore noted.
   He said he does not think that committee members would have any
problems seeing the fortune go to school coffers.
   ``We would be very very happy to have this money and to help out
the students,'' Collamore said.

<TEXT>
   Hispanic pediatrician Antonia Novello,
described as ``a ball of energy,'' is in line to become the next
surgeon general and the first woman to hold the post, according to
administration sources.
   Novello, deputy director of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, is undergoing routine background
checks before her formal nomination by President Bush, said the
sources, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
   If nominated by Bush and confirmed by the Senate, she would
succeed C. Everett Koop, the outspoken pediatric surgeon who
stepped down last month after serving as surgeon general for seven
years.
   Novello's office said she had no comment.
   Novello, 45, is a native of Puerto Rico. She graduated from the
University of Puerto Rico and in 1970 from the university's medical
school in the top 5 percent of her class. She is a pediatric kidney
specialist.
   She joined the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in April 1986, where she is deputy director as well as
coordinator for AIDS research. She also is a clinical professor of
pediatrics at Georgetown University and a commissioned officer in
the Public Health Service.
   Novello is married to psychiatrist Dr. Joe Novello, who hosted a
talk show on a Washington radio station and whose brother is Don
Novello, the comedian better known as ``Father Guido Sarducci.''
   She was recommended to the White House by Louis Sullivan,
secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the
sources said. Her nomination was also pushed by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, for whom she worked in 1982-83 when he was chairman of the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   Paul Smith, a spokesman for Hatch, said he remembered Novello as
``a ball of energy. She's got a lot of vitality. She was
enthusiastic about everything she did. We think she'll be a good
spokesman for health issues.''
   Novello also was among a number of women recommended for the job
by Bush's personal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who said she
``would be terrific'' as surgeon general.
   Novello apparently has satisfied the White House that her views
on abortion are acceptable to the president. Bush says he opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother's
life.
   Chase Untermeyer, Bush's personnel chief, said Tuesday that the
White House has been asking candidates recommended for jobs where
abortion is an issue about their views on the subject. Those
questions were asked of candidates for surgeon general, he said,
but he would not comment on Novello and refused to confirm or deny
that she is Bush's choice.
   ``The president's position on abortion, and that of the
Republican Party, is well known, and the American people knew that
when he was a candidate,'' Untermeyer said.
   ``Therefore, it is entirely appropriate for people being
considered for appointments at HHS to be asked if they hold the
same views as those of the president of the United States, who
would appoint them,'' he said.
   Lee said Tuesday he would like to be surgeon general but was out
of the running because he disagrees with the president on abortion.
   ``I would love the job,'' Lee said, adding, ``I think it's
wrong'' to require a litmus test on the abortion issue.
   Koop, who during his seven years used the surgeon general's post
as a pulpit to preach healthy living to the country, is strongly
opposed to abortion and was a darling of conservatives when he was
nominated.
   However, he alienated many of those early supporters with a
report on AIDS, advocating use of condoms and sex education at
young ages. And he incurred their wrath again earlier this year
when he refused to issue a report requested by then-President
Reagan on whether women suffer psychological harm from abortion. He
said there was insufficient scientific evidence to reach the
conclusion the White House wanted.
   Anti-abortion groups have been closely following progress on
filling the surgeon general's post to make sure the person Bush
chooses holds his views on abortion.

   A fire that swept through a three-story row
house, killing five children and two adults, appears to have been
accidental, fire officials said.
   However, Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer stressed that the
cause of Tuesday morning's blaze _ the worst in the city in more
than three years _ had not been determined.
   Ulshafer said the house apparently had no smoke alarms, which
are not required in older, private homes. Three of the dead were
found near a window, he said.
   The victims were the father, son and five grandchildren of June
Scott, who escaped unharmed with a 5-year-old grandchild.
   ``It's a very great, great, great tragedy,'' Mrs. Scott said.
``You don't know how I feel about losing my father and my baby boy
and five little babies that couldn't even help themselves.''
   Ray Belikoff, an investigator with the city Medical Examiner's
Office, identified the victims as Clyde Staples, 66; Emerson Lee,
19; Joseph Lee, 7; Jamal Lee, 3; Jeffrey Lee, 3; Andrell McCoy, 5,
and Shanta McCoy, 3.
   Ian Baldwin, who lives across the street, said he and other
neighbors tried to enter the burning house from the rear. ``There
was too much smoke,'' he said.
   The fire was the city's deadliest since May 1986, when an
arsonist killed nine people in an apartment complex in northeast
Philadelphia.

   Newlyweds Tammy McZeal and Albert Franco
staged their wedding reception on a sidewalk in downtown's Skid Row
_ because they are homeless and the sidewalk is their home.
   ``We live in the area. Why should we pretend to be something
that we're not?'' the 35-year-old Franco said as he sat at the pink
and white wedding table across the street from the St. Vincent de
Paul Men's Center.
   The couple fled from TV cameras Sunday into the county
courthouse to exchange wedding vows, then had the sidewalk
reception. Plastic plates and cups and a bouquet of cloth flowers
were set out next to a busy food line.
   ``I figure, why have something you can't afford and be away from
the people that you know?'' said the new Mrs. Franco, 18, who wore
a lacy white dress and bridal veil provided by a church group.
   Women from the West Angeles Church of God and Christ also
provided wedding gifts, the cake, and even money for the marriage
license.
   The Rev. James Shaw, who ministers to Skid Row residents, met
the couple in his ministry's food line and persuaded them to
legalize their union after he found out they were living together.
   Franco said he and his bride will not stay on Skid Row much
longer.
   ``You have to crawl before you walk,'' he said. ``Now it's time
for us to walk.''

<TEXT>
   Federal subsidies that keep commuter airlines
flying into 21 small towns from Temple, Texas, to Benton Harbor,
Mich., are on the verge of elimination, a casualty of budgetary
warfare.
   ``If we lose the subsidy ... Mansfield loses air service,'' said
Ralph Baker, vice president of GCS Air Services, which has shuttled
passengers from Mansfield, Ohio, to Cleveland since February 1988.
The company has lost money on the route despite the federal
assistance, Baker said.
   ``This is going to be a drastic blow to us,'' said John
Chaddock, manager of Twin Cities Airport, which serves Benton
Harbor and St. Joseph, Mich.
   A House-Senate conference committee voted this week to spend
$30.7 million for the Essential Air Service program, which
subsidizes air carriers that serve small communities.
   The Senate had sought the $35.5 million needed to preserve
funding for all 110 communities now being helped. The House called
for only $12.4 million, while the Bush administration proposed
phasing out the program, starting with a $5.5 million cut.
   The $30.7 million figure is close to last year's $31.6 million
total. But the lawmakers adopted new criteria that will squeeze out
21 towns that currently qualify.
   Under the agreement, towns would not be eligible if the average
subsidy exceeds $200 per passenger. Current rules deny aid to
communities with average subsidies exceeding $300 per passenger.
   Communities also would not qualify if they are closer than 70
miles to the nearest large or medium hub airport, within 55 miles
of a small hub or 45 miles of a ``qualifying non-hub,'' which
averages at least 100 passenger boardings a day. The restrictions
do not apply to Alaska or Hawaii.
   The program is included in the $11.9 billion transportation
spending bill for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. The compromise
bill must be approved by the House and Senate and signed by
President Bush.
   Congressional attitudes about the program perennially split
along geographic lines, pitting lawmakers from urban areas against
those from sparsely populated and large states. Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., is a vocal
supporter of the program.
   Backers say the program helps small communities attract and
maintain industry through their link with larger airports.
Opponents say the deficit-strapped federal treasury cannot afford
the subsidies, which sometimes reach $400 per passenger.
   A loss of federal funds does not necessarily mean the end of
commuter service to affected airlines. But unless state or local
governments or other sources take up the slack, the future of air
service at the 21 towns will depend on whether the airlines find it
worthwhile to continue.
   Philip Trenary, whose small airline provides subsidized service
to Temple, Texas, said he will not abandon the central Texas town
and will try to keep providing service to Dallas-Forth Worth
International Airport until the route turns a profit.
   ``I'm going to let the community know we're not bailing out,
we're going to find a way to stay there,'' said Trenary. He said he
would ask Temple to join his airline, Exec Express II, in a
promotional campaign.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, whose district includes Temple, said
his constituents are suffering from the government's lack of fiscal
discipline.
   ``Our failure to deal with the deficit will cause many worthy
programs to be cut or eliminated,'' Leath said.
   But Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, who represents Mansfield, said it
was difficult to complain about cutting subsidies to some
communities. Fewer than five passengers a day take the
Mansfield-to-Cleveland flight, according to the Transportation
Department. The subsidy is $170 per passenger.
   ``I got discouraged from doing too much when I saw how big the
subsidy was,'' Pease said.

   The earth shook and the sky burned, just as
in 1906. If Tuesday's earthquake wasn't ``The Big One,'' it was
close enough to send tremors of fear through natives used to the
unsteady underpinnings of their city.
   ``My first thought was it was the Big One,'' said Gerald
Volkman, who was drinking a milkshake at a ground-floor eatery when
the quake struck.
   ``The whole floor shook. I was born and raised here and I never
felt one like this. I was scared.''
   The ``Big One'' is the quake San Franciscans have been told is
just around the corner. After every temblor of appreciable size,
newspapers, radio and TV roll out stories about how the area could
be devastated by a great quake and how to prepare for it.
   Every April on the anniversary of the 1906 quake and fire that
killed at least 500 people here, reporters interview survivors who
recall that day when the earth heaved and the sky glowed with the
flames of a city alight.
   On Tuesday, smoke from a fire in the Marina district near the
bay rose high into the sky, creating a backdrop to City Hall miles
away.
   Chuck Gee, also a native San Franciscan, thought he saw smoke
from a fire as he jumped under a desk in his second-floor office.
   ``It was dust from masonry that fell into the street outside,''
he said, as he stood in front of a Market Street building whose
broken sprinkler system sprayed water onto the busy thoroughfare.
   ``I'm used to earthquakes. I've even slept through some.
Sometimes you're not sure if they are quakes and your first
reaction is it might be a passing truck. Not this one. I knew right
away. Powerful. That's what it was. Powerful.''
   Gee spoke shortly after darkness set in. Only the lights of cars
and other vehicles, and the flashlights of a few pedestrians,
provided any light on Market Street.
   People stood in clusters, recalling their experiences. Their
voices mingled with the sounds of pedestrians' feet crushing
splinters of glass, the remains of windows that crashed to the
pavement.
   Old buildings seemed to lose the most windows. Glass littered
the front and sides of the old Furniture Mart on Market Street.
Across the street, the newer Fox Plaza apparently lost no windows.
Further down Market, the San Franciscan Hotel lost some ornate
facade fixtures.
   One of the first rules of quake survival is to get in the clear
and away from possible falling objects, a lesson not lost on many
who gathered in parking lots and in front of City Hall.
   ``Another one might happen,'' said Roland Hidalgo, who stood in
a parking lot off Market. He was asked what he did when the quake
struck.
   ``I'm religious,'' he said. ``I prayed.''
   Down at Powell and Market, people gathered around a
battery-operated radio to hear the latest news. Cable cars stood
idle nearby.
   Sonia Avitia of San Jose asked for directions to a hotel. She
was told they're all up and down Powell Street.
   ``I want a new one,'' she said. ``I want an earthquake-proof
one.''
   Dora Cortez said she wasn't too frightened during the quake.
   Cortez hands out religious tracts on Market and she was very
busy.
   ``We are in the last days and things like earthquakes will
happen,'' she said.
   People often ignore her and refuse to take the tracts.
   ``Not today, yes, yes,'' she said.

<HEAD>Flag Burning Amendment Sponsors Bail Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning
is moving toward a vote in the Senate minus two original sponsors,
who bailed out saying they do not want to tamper with the Bill of
Rights.
   ``It was a mistake of the heart but nonetheless it was a
mistake,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., told the Senate on Tuesday
as he withdrew as one of 53 cosponsors of the proposed
constitutional amendment.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., another cosponsor, also took to the
Senate floor to abandon his support.
   And Democratic critics said for the first time the measure was
likely to be defeated in a floor vote set for Thursday morning.
   ``I hope and expect that there will not be sufficient votes for
the amendment to prevail,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters.
   The measure would authorize the federal and state governments to
ban burning the American flag.
   The House approved and sent to President Bush on Thursday a bill
that would ban burning and other desecration of the American flag
by simple statute. He said he would allow it to become law without
his signature while continuing to press for a constitutional
amendment.
   Supporters of a constitutional amendment say any statute is
likely to be overturned in court on grounds that it violates free
speech guaranteed under the Bill of Rights.
   The campaign for a constitutional amendment began in June after
the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of Texas flag-burner
Gregory Lee Johnson on grounds that his right to free speech had
been violated.
   Critics of the amendment say a ``content neutral'' law that
outlaws flag-burning regardless of whether it involves political
protest is better than tampering with constitutional freedoms.
   If the measure is approved by the Senate it goes to the House
and then to state legislatures. A proposed constitutional amendment
must be approved by 38 legislatures before becoming part of the
Constitution.
   Danforth said that if the Senate did approve the measure it most
likely would eventually be ratified, adding, ``If it is going to be
stopped it must be stopped in the Senate.''
   ``This is not a throwaway vote,'' Danforth said. ``This is not
just the kind of vote you cast thinking, well, this is nothing,
somebody else can act as the safety net.''
   ``We are the decision-makers,'' he said. ``We will be
responsible if the Constitution will be amended, and if it is
amended it will be the first time in the history of our country
that we have altered the Bill of Rights.''
   A backer of the amendment, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, scoffed at
the notion that the Senate would be unduly tampering with freedom
of speech if it passed the measure.
   ``This freedom has never been deemed absolute,'' Hatch said.
``Obscenity has never been protected under the First Amendment.''
He said other restrictions also exist, such as libel laws.
   Hatch said the measure ``does not prevent a single idea or
thought from being expressed ... it merely prevents conduct with
respect to one object and one object only and that's our flag. We
can withdraw that object from desecration without limiting freedom
of speech.''
   ``I believe it is futile to try to overturn this particular
Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution by a statute,''
Hatch said.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, however, that the measure
would put new powers in the hands of government and ``it contains
no limits, no checks on the exercise of that power.''

   Here is a look at the earthquake that jolted Northern California
on Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE QUAKE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The quake hit at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale. It was centered on the notorious San Andreas Fault, about
eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz and about 75 miles south of San
Francisco. It was the sixth-most powerful quake to strike
California this century and the most powerful since a 7.0 quake
centered in Eureka in 1980. The tremor was felt as far away as Los
Angeles, 400 miles to the south. At least four aftershocks of
lesser magnitude followed.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CASUALTIES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 people were killed, making the quake the second
deadliest in the nation's history following the 1906 San Francisco
quake that killed more than 700.
   At least 200 people were crushed to death in their cars when a
mile-long section of the upper level of Interstate 880 in Oakland
collapsed onto the lower level. In San Francisco, five people were
killed when a building collapsed on cars and three others died in a
spectacular fire in the Marina district, apparently triggered by a
ruptured gas line. Six others died in the collapse of part of the
City Garden Mall in Santa Cruz, and one person died of a heart
attack San Jose.
   About 400 people were injured, mostly by falling or being hit by
debris.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DAMAGE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Highways, bridges and buildings collapsed, a few fires broke
out, plaster fell off buildings and ceilings and windows popped out
of high-rise buildings. Power was knocked out to as many as 1
million customers in the Bay area and telephone service was
disrupted.
   In addition to the collapse along Interstate 880 in Oakland, a
30-foot section of the upper level of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed onto the lower level, closing the span. The San
Mateo bridge, which crosses the bay about 10 miles south of
Candlestick Park, was closed for inspection. The Golden Gate
Bridge, which connects San Francisco to Marin County to the north,
remained open with no reports of damage. The Bay Area Rapid Transit
system was shut down, the Oakland Airport was closed and San
Francisco Airport was restricted to outgoing flights. Traffic was
snarled and thousands of commuters were stranded.
   A fire destroyed several buildings in the Marina section of San
Francisco and another fire damaged a section of downtown Berkeley.
   At least two bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed and other
highways leading out of the city suffered significant damage. In
nearby Hollister, a bridge on Highway 101 collapsed and a downtown
department store caved in.
   The Defense Department reported ``light to moderate damage'' at
the several military installations in the Bay area.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was
prepared to send help. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and
Vice President Quayle were heading to the area to assess the
damage, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency dispatched
officials to Sacramento to help state workers handle aid paperwork.
Military officials mobilized two National Guard units to aid the
rescue. Gov. George Deukmejian cut short a trade mission to
Frankfurt, West Germany, and flew home on a U.S. Air Force plane.

<NOTE>WORLD SERIES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake shook Candlestick Park about a half hour before
Game Three of the World Series was to begin, forcing the game's
cancellation and the evacuation of 60,000 fans. No major injuries
reported at the stadium.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Aid to Nicaragua's Opposition Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is expected to quickly sign
legislation providing $9 million to the Nicaraguan political
opposition's campaign to wrest power from the Sandinista government
in February's national elections.
   The Senate approved the package 64 to 35 late Tuesday after
soundly defeating a series of attempts to cut or restrict the
money. The House had approved it Oct. 4 on a vote of 263-156.
   Bush is expected to sign the measure soon so that aid can begin
to flow this month, the only month when voter registration is
conducted for the Feb. 25, 1990, balloting.
   The opposition coalition, known as UNO, ``needs our assistance
desperately,'' Bush wrote in a last-minute letter to the Senate
urging support for the package. ``Only by receiving help can it
make a real contest of this election,'' he wrote.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the upcoming
elections ``the last crucial shot at getting representative
democracy in Nicaragua.''
   Agreement on the package represented a political truce of sorts
on what has been the most divisive foreign policy issue to confront
Congress this decade.
   Since President Reagan helped create the Contra rebels eight
years ago to oust the leftist Managua government, the United States
has spent some $350 million to apply military pressure, with each
increment of aid heatedly fought in Congress. Congressional
restrictions on Contra aid played a large role in Reagan's greatest
scandal, the Iran-Contra affair.
   In his letter to lawmakers, Bush acknowledged administration
discomfort with a Nicaraguan law that could send as much as $2
million directly to the Sandinista-controlled Supreme Electoral
Council. But he added: ``We should not let this displeasure ... be
used as a transparent attempt to prevent the United States from
helping its democratic friends.''
   The package would send $9 million through the National Endowment
for Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that promotes democratic
elections around the world to pay for ostensibly nonpartisan
activities like voter registration, election monitoring and party
building.
   While NED's charter forbids direct partisan campaign support,
the Bush administration believes that money spent to promote the
democratic process will work to the advantage of opposition
presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro, publisher of the
opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   The opposition coalition includes 14 parties spanning the
spectrum from conservative to socialist and communist. Party
officials complain they lack even basic office supplies, while the
ruling Sandinistas have all the resources of the government,
including state-run media, at their disposal.
   While the legislation was vague on how the money will be used,
it appeared that up to $6 million could go directly to the UNO
opposition group and as much as $2 million to the
government-controlled electoral council. Nicaraguan law levies a 50
percent tax on foreign political contributions for certain purposes.
   The endowment has been involved in elections in the Philippines,
Chile and Poland, among others. But critics _ both liberals and
conservatives _ point out that the administration's planned
spending in Nicaragua far exceeds anything the endowment has used
in other countries. Congress already had given it $3.5 million in
the last year to aid the election process there.
   ``Rather than ensuring free and fair elections, this package
could well undermine them,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``Do we
really want Mrs. Chamorro to be known as the best candidate the
United States can buy?''
   Harkin and others also attacked the vagueness of the spending
request. While just over $1 million of the money would go to three
independent election monitoring groups, including one led by former
President Carter, the rest of the money is less specifically
described.
   The endowment could conduct get-out-the-vote activities, pay
costs of voter registration campaigns, civic education about
elections and spend money to ``build party infrastructures.''
   The measure would authorize no new money, but would instead
transfer the funds to the endowment from unspent balances in other
accounts. As a condition of the aid, the administration gave
Congress private assurances it would not seek to covertly influence
the election.

   A businessman trying to become the first blind
person in the U.S. Foreign Service says he wants to become a true
diplomat and not be swept into a sheltered corner reserved for the
handicapped.
   ``Any attempt to categorize blind people means separation, and
separation is a denial of equality,'' 47-year-old Avraham Rabby
told a joint meeting of House Foreign Affairs and Civil Service
subcommittees on Tuesday.
   The Oxford-educated Rabby is near his goal of joining the
Foreign Service after a 15-year effort following the State
Department's announcement last week that it would no longer bar
candidates just because of their blindness.
   Rabby, who lives in New York City, said he hopes he and blind
diplomats who may follow him will have their handicap considered
``as merely one characteristic in a normal individual who, like any
sighted Foreign Service officer, brings to the service a wide
variety of strengths and weaknesses.''
   ``Blind people are as different from one another as sighted
people,'' Rabby said. ``There is no such thing as a category
labled, ``The Blind.''
   He objected to what he called the State Department's past
assumption that ``if one is blind, one is necessarily slow,
inattentive to one's environment, and hopelessly vulnerable to any
international terrorist who may be intent on doing harm.''
   Describing his long battle to become a member of the Foreign
Service, Rabby noted his honors degree from Oxford University in
Spanish and French, his master's degree in business administration
from the University of Chicago and his success leading a business
aimed at helping the handicapped begin careers.
   Although he passed the Foreign Service entrance examination
several times, Rabby said his candidacy was always rejected because
of his blindness, with officials offering one explanation after
another of why that was a disqualification.
   But last week the State Department announced it was reversing
its policy.
   Rabby, in what he called ``that welcome telephone call,'' was
told he could meet with department officials to discuss the terms
and conditions of his employment as a diplomat.
   ``It's historic, and it's one of those occasions when you can be
joyful,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., who fought for Rabby's
appointment.
   Ambassador Edward J. Perkins, the new director general of the
Foreign Service, told the panel the agency had decided it could
make accomodations for blind people ``just as we do for sighted
people, based on what they can accomplish.''
   Sikorski and other panel members advised Rabby not to settle for
an inferior Foreign Service post.
   Some said they would not object if he were named as an
ambassador.

<HEAD>Journalist, Judge Slain; Judicial Workers Strike Over Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to CLARIFY that Vargas Escobar eighth news
industry worker, not journalist, killed since crackdown began. Picks up
7th, `The journalist ...' ^By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The country's judges went on strike to
protest a colleague's assassination and gunmen killed yet another
journalist, the eighth news industry worker slain since the
government launched its all-out war on cocaine barons.
   An anonymous caller claiming to speak for drug traffickers took
responsibility for Tuesday's killing of Hector Jimenez Rodriguez, a
federal appeals court judge in the cocaine trafficking center of
Medellin.
   Hours later in Medellin, assassins gunned down radio journalist
Diego Vargas Escobar in similar fashion, police said.
   The slaying of Jimenez, 55, sparked a three-day strike by about
17,000 judicial workers, including most of Colombia's judges, to
demand more protection from drug gangs.
   Traffickers seek through murder, bombings and threats to force
an end to the government's crackdown on Colombia's cocaine cartels,
which was launched after the Aug. 18 slaying of presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader.
   Vargas Escobar, 54, was the eighth news industry worker slain
since the crackdown began. A radio journalist said Vargas Escobar,
who worked for the Medellin station La Voz de las Americas, had
recently received death threats.
   The journalist, who did not want to be identified for security
reasons, said he did not know who made the threats.
   In anonymous calls to radio stations last week, The
Extraditables _ alleged traffickers wanted in the United States _
claimed responsiblity for the slayings of two journalists in
Medellin.
   Police said Jimenez was about to step into the car of a
colleague outside his home when two men pulled up on a motorcycle
and one strolled over and shot the judge six times.
   An anonymous caller told a radio station in Medellin that The
Extraditables killed him in retaliation for the extradition of
Colombian drug suspects to the United States.
   Colombia has extradited four suspects since President Virgilio
Barco initiated the crackdown, and The Extraditables have promised
that they would kill 10 judges for every drug dealer extradited.
   None of the 12 alleged top Colombian drug bosses wanted by the
United States have been captured, but the government has seized
millions of dollars in their alleged assets.
   Jimenez was a federal appeals court judge for 20 years in
Medellin. All federal judges in the city have handled drug matters,
but it was not known whether Jimenez had any cases recently.
   The court workers' union declared a 72-hour strike to demand
more protection for the judicial branch.
   Various figures are given on the number of judges slain in
Colombia. The court workers' union says 221 court employees,
including 42 judges, have been killed during the past 12 years,
many of them by drug traffickers.
   Union officials said Colombia's 4,600 judges are still waiting
to receive bullet-proof vests as part of a $19 million U.S. aid
program to protect them.
   ``The justice ministry told us some time ago that it had
received just 15 bullet-proof vests and would distribute them
soon,'' said Yolanda Parra, an administrator at the court worker's
union. ``But judges have still not gotten anything.''
   The union's president, Antonio Suarez, met late Tuesday with the
country's justice minister, Roberto Salazar Manrique, to repeat
judges' demands for more government protection.
   Ms. Parra said judicial officials had sent numerous messages
expressing their security concerns but had received no response
from the ministry.
   ``Part of the problem has been the instablity at the ministry,''
she said, referring to the recent resignation of Monica de Greiff,
who became justice minister July 16 and quit 70 days later.
   Former Communications Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds took on the
duties of justice minister until Oct. 8, when Roberto Salazar
Manrique was named to the post.

<HEAD>State Officials Want the Grants, Not the Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials are eager to get grants for
toughening their highway safety laws but say Congress would be
going too far if they were penalized for not falling into line.
   The officials objected in Senate testimony Tuesday to a
provision in a proposed law that would withhold up to 10 percent of
a state's federal highway funds unless it required the use of seat
belts in automobiles and helmets on motorcycles.
   The law, introduced by Sen. John R. Chafee, R-R.I., also would
provide grants to help states implement and enforce their programs.
   Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia have mandatory
seat belt laws. Forty-seven states have some motorcycle helmet
laws, but only 22 states and the District of Columbia require them
for all riders over 21.
   The proposed law also covers child restraint devices, although
all 50 states have laws on the books.
   ``Any federal legislation should seek to encourage efforts to
find just the right mix of requirements and incentives to result in
increased safety,'' Virginia state Senator Charles Waddell told the
Senate Environment and Public Works subcommittee on water
resources, transportation and infrastructure.
   ``Adding to the list of ways in which a state can jeopardize
funding for transportation, including safety, only limits the
state's ability to find the most effective combination of laws,
regulations and educational efforts to encourage driver and
passenger safety,'' said Waddell, speaking for the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   ``We believe that sanctions would be counterproductive,'' said
Paul Jones of the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety
Representatives.
   The group says it supports the incentive grant portion of the
proposed law to finance training and enforcement, community
education and information, worksite and other programs.
   But the sanctions have no appeal.
   ``Withholding a state's highway construction funds could
exacerbate highway safety problems by preventing a state from
rehabilitating deteriorating pavement, adding capacity, or making
other engineering improvements which would improve the safety of
the highways,'' the group said in prepared testimony.
   Chafee said nearly 50,000 people are killed on the highways each
year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates
20,000 lives have been saved over the last five years because of
motorcycle helmets and automobile safety belts.
   Public health groups, physicians and the insurance industry
support Chafee's proposal. Motorcycle rider groups are among the
opponents.

<HEAD>Reagan Wonders Whether Iran-Contra Scandal Was a `Setup'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan says he wonders now
whether the Iran-Contra affair that rocked his second term in the
White House wasn't ``a setup, a sting operation, by the Iranians.''
   Reagan's latest comment on the most controversial foreign policy
initiative of his eight years in office comes in a new book,
``Speaking My Mind,'' published by Simon and Schuster.
   The book is a collection of speeches, each preceded by a short
essay containing Reagan's reflection on the subject or the occasion.
   One of the speeches is his March 4, 1987, address after the
release of the Tower Commission report on his administration's
decision to sell arms to Iran while seeking Iranian help for the
release of American hostages.
   The commission, appointed by Reagan to look into the
controversy, said his decision to sell arms to Iran ``rewarded a
regime that clearly supported terrorism and hostage-taking.''
   Reagan, in his speech, took responsibility for things that had
``happened on my watch,'' but also said he ``didn't ask enough
about the specifics of the total Iran plan.''
   He has since said there are many aspects of the affair he still
does not understand.
   In his new remarks, the former president defended the initiative
although he said that ``something clearly went wrong with our
original plan.''
   ``I'm going to cover this more completely in my memoirs,'' he
wrote, ``but I get beside myself when I think that people believe I
would actually trade arms for hostages.''
   ``I did not see it as trading arms for hostages because we were
dealing with Iranian intermediaries, not the kidnappers
themselves,'' said Reagan. ``I know it may be a fine line to most
people, but it's what I believed then and what I still believe.''
   ``I have to say that in looking back I wonder if this whole
thing wasn't a setup, a sting operation, by the Iranians,'' said
the former president. ``Maybe we were conned into believing these
were moderate Iranians seeking to reach out to the West, while in
reality they were working directly for the Ayatollah just to get
some arms. Who knows?''
   The episode became known as the Iran-Contra affair because some
of the sale proceeds were diverted to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua, whose fight against the country's leftist regime was
strongly backed by Reagan.
   Elsewhere in his book, Reagan writes that Nicaragua's Sandinista
government ``completely bamboozled many on Capitol Hill'' and adds,
``I also honestly believe that the Sandinistas hoodwinked many in
the American press.''
   On another subject, Reagan says that even his wife, Nancy, was
against his going ahead with a planned visit to a cemetery at
Bitburg, West Germany, despite the controversy that arose because
48 Nazi storm troopers were buried there. He says he decided to go
anyway because ``I didn't feel that we could ask new generations of
Germans to live with this guilt forever without any hope of
redemption.''
   In the prologue to the March 8, 1983, speech in which Reagan
denounced the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' he writes that
the characterization was apt at the time, but ``I could not in good
conscience today call the Soviet Union an evil empire.''
   Of his speech before departing for his first meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, he says, ``I did not
know when I left for that meeting in Geneva, I would eventually
call Mikhail Gorbachev a friend.''

<HEAD>USDA Sees French Market Changing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Take a look at the potatoes in France if you
want to learn something about the local lifestyle.
   ``Four years ago it was usual to see sacks of unwashed potatoes
on supermarket shelves, but such presentation is no longer
acceptable,'' says an Agriculture Department report.
   Today is is usual for raw potatoes, sacked or loose, to be
washed before they are presented to shoppers, the report said. And
many French food buyers are opting for frozen, precooked potatoes.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said the
coming-of-age of France's baby boomers, along with fewer
adolescents and a rapid increase in senior citizens, has meant a
rise in demand for more conveniently packaged or prepared foods.
   ``Over two-fifths of French women are now in the workforce,''
the report said. ``They want foods that require less preparation
time, stimulating a rise of ready-to-eat and microwaveable foods.''
   A similar trend developed in the United States in the 1970s and
1980s, the agency said in a forthcoming issue of AgExporter
magazine. The study of French grocery habits was undertaken to help
give U.S. exporters a better understanding of the changing French
market.
   ``The increasing number of senior citizens also is creating a
market for products and packaging adapted to the special needs of
older consumers,'' the report said.
   And the leisurely French lunch is fading into memory. As the
typical French work week is becoming shorter, the midday meal is
more hurried, increasing the demand for meals at fast-food
restaurants and cafeterias.
   ``More and more French consumers prefer to make a weekly trip to
the supermarket rather than frequent and time-consuming trips to
butchers, bakers, produce markets and other small specialty
shops,'' the report said.
   The preference for supermarket or ``hypermarket'' shopping is
especially evident among single-person and two-income households,
where time for shopping is limited.
   Another result of the changes has been the domination of big
supermarkets in the French retail grocery industry. They accounted
for 46 percent of grocery purchases in 1987, compared with 37
percent in 1983, the report said.
   This year, for the first time, French shoppers are estimated to
buy more than 50 percent of their food in the big hypermarkets.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold China additional U.S. wheat under a price
subsidy program.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday that three private
exporting companies made the deals for a total of 300,000 metric
tons under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized China under EEP
last Feb. 27. With the latest EEP approvals, China has 340,000 tons
remaining to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 11 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at $3.85 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of around $42 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $12.81 per ton, or
about 35 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by the Peavey Co., 210,000
tons; Cargill Inc., 50,000; and Bunge Corp., 40,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 4.3 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
on June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China bought
more than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the EEP
program.

   Dry weather last week helped farmers take a
big bite out of field work, including rapid progress in the fall
harvests of corn and soybeans, says the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``Rain was needed in the Great Plains to promote winter wheat
emergence and development,'' the facility said Tuesday. ``Soil
moisture was short to adequate in the Great Plains and most of the
West, and adequate in the East. Soil moisture was adequate to short
in the Delta.''
   The facility, operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, reported that by the end of the Oct. 9-15 week an
estimated 81 percent of the winter wheat had been planted, nine
percentage points ahead of normal.
   About 46 percent of the corn had been harvested, two points
ahead of normal, and 55 percent of the soybeans, eight points ahead.
   The cotton harvest, however, was only 23 percent completed, nine
points behind the normal pace.

   Brick walls and stairwells collapsed and
cheers for the home team turned to horror as thousands of Oakland
residents struggled through the killer earthquake that rocked the
Bay Area.
   As workers frantically tried to reach victims trapped in their
vehicles between two concrete slabs on Interstate 880, Dr. Carter
Clements, assistant chief of the emergency department at Oakland's
Highland Hospital, prepared for the worst.
   ``I expect a lot of people unfortunately are going to die at the
scene of their injuries because of the difficulty of getting them
out,'' Clements said.
   ``You can't drop that much concrete on a car and get out of it.
... I'm afraid a lot of people will be dead.''
   At least 200 people were killed in their cars when a mile-long
section of the upper level of Interstate 880 collapsed onto the
lower level, said Marty Boyer, the Alameda County public
information officer. County Sheriff Charles Plummer confirmed the
death toll of 200 people.
   Clements said that more injuries were likely as the hours passed.
   ``My guess is that we're going to see, over the next 12 to 24
hours, injuries related to the quake but not severe injuries,'' he
said.
   At Jack London Square, a crowd gathered to watch the World
Series game between the A's and San Francisco Giants on a giant
television screen. At first, the fans thought the quake was not
severe, and even applauded. But when the screen flashed to a
collapsed Bay Bridge, there was horrified silence.
   ``They tell you this is going to happen but I never believed
it,'' one shaken fan told The Tribune of Oakland.
   Caroline Thomas was at work in a brick building at 13th Street
and Broadway when the earthquake struck. When the shaking stopped,
she ran for the stairwell.
   It wasn't there.
   ``My God, it collapsed just like that,'' she said after a
terrifying walk down an eight-story fire department ladder.
   Just a few doors away, Anita Williams stood shaking, clutching
her chest and trying to regain control.
   ``The buildings swayed, the walls jerked and cracked,'' she
said, adding that she ran from her building and discovered part of
its facade littering the street with rubble.
   As a BART train jerked on its track, Robert Steller thought,
``This is what it feels like to die.''
   In Oakland's Chinatown, people gathered on the sidewalks,
comparing notes in rapid-fire Cantonese.
   And throughout the city, neighbors and shop owners opened their
homes to strangers, allowing them to make frantic calls home.
   On streets littered with glass and plaster, people lined up 10
deep at pay phones to say they were OK. Some of the city's grandest
old buildings showed the effects of the quake, their windows
shattered.

   A replica of Henry Hudson's exploring ship,
the Half Moon, left port on its first voyage, four months late and
towed by a tug boat.
   The 85-foot, 120-ton replica was pulled Tuesday to New York
City, where it will enter a shipyard Thursday for repairs on its
diesel engine.
   The replica of Hudson's 17th-century ship was originally
scheduled to leave its berth July 5 for a tour of several ports.
But it was delayed in June by the death of the ship's architect and
chief builder, Nicholas Benton, who was killed when he fell from
the mast of another ship.
   Engine problems further prolonged the departure of the ship.
   Interior work on the replica will be completed this winter in
North Carolina, spokeswoman Carole McLeod said.
   The ship, which cost about $1 million to build, was conceived by
Andrew Hendricks, a North Carolina resident who plans to use it to
give lessons on the contributions of the Dutch in U.S. history.

<HEAD>Ivory Jewelry, Rather Than the Elephant, is Becoming Extinct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivory is falling out of favor in America in an
effort to keep the elephant from falling into extinction.
   Leaders in the fashion industry say many stores have stopped
selling and many customers stopped buying jewelry made of ivory.
One trade paper says women soon may be wearing jewelry made of cow
bones, instead.
   ``I talk to jewelers every day, from Main Street to Fifth
Avenue, and they all express abhorrence at selling ivory today,''
says David Federman, gemstone writer for Modern Jeweler magazine.
``If they're doing it, they're selling it under the counter.''
   So thoroughly has the ivory boycott caught on that some see in
it the seeds of an environmental ethic in high fashion.
   ``There seems to be a very strong trend among Americans to think
first of wildlife, of compassion, and not our own vanity,'' says
Reenie Brown, publisher of the trade magazine Accessories. ``It's
becoming unfashionable to wear furs, too,'' she says.
   Ms. Brown has banned ivory from a trade show she runs and from
the pages of her magazines. ``I've lost some ads,'' she says.
   Environmentalists say the ivory story is comparable to what
happened a decade ago when people became aware of the threat that
the spotted cats _ jaguars, cheetahs and leopards _ could become
extinct.
   Coats made of those furs virtually disappeared from the market
under the pressure of an outcry for endangered species.
   ``Ivory Industry Faces Extinction,'' Colored Stone, another
trade journal, says in its current issue.
   ``Many dealers are switching to ivory substitutes,'' the
publication says. ``Treated cow bone seems to be the current
favorite.''
   Environmentalist Brian Day of the World Wildlife Fund says the
price of ivory at places that still sell it has dropped by 50
percent, as dealers seek to unload their stocks.
   Steinway &amp; Sons wrote this summer to 800 ``Steinway artists'' _
ranging from Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn to Billy Taylor and
Peter Nero _ that the company would stop producing ivory-keyed
pianos for concert tours and switch to plastic. It made that switch
years ago for ordinary pianos.
   ``Without exception, all were appreciative of the environmental
concern,'' said spokesman Leo Spellman.
   The ivory boycott took off this summer after President Bush
signed an order prohibiting the import of African ivory. Canada,
Western Europe and Japan followed suit.
   The United States had accounted for 12 percent of world ivory
imports. Japan and Hong Kong were the heaviest importers.
   Bush's action set the stage for the vote this week by an
international conference to classify the elephant as an endangered
species and ban all trade in elephant products.
   Five African nations balked, saying they would continue selling
tusks, but the ban is still likely to undercut the market for
elephant poachers who hunt with automatic rifles.
   About 70,000 elephants are killed each year, according to
William Conway, general director of the New York Zoological
Society. He said the African elephant population has fallen from
1.5 million 10 years ago to 625,000.
   Last week, major retailers pledged not to sell ivory and and
clothing designers said they would not use it in a campaign
organized by designer Liz Claiborne.
   Taking the pledge were such stores as Macy's, Lord &amp; Taylor,
Nordstrom, Marshall Field's and the Federated, Allied and Carter
Hawley Hale chains and designers Oscar de la Renta, Dana Buchman,
Linda Allard and Bill Blass.
   ``We believe that ivory must be kept out of fashion and in the
possession of the magnificent creatures for whom it was originally
designed,'' those firms said. ``Why should a baby elephant be
orphaned for a few bangles and beads?''

<HEAD>Decoder-Equipped TVs Seen Benefiting More Than Hearing-Impaired</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Making television sets that can decode closed
captions for the hearing impaired would also benefit millions of
other Americans who need help with language and reading skills,
supporters say.
   The captions can currently be seen only on televisions hooked up
to a separate electronic decoder that costs about $180, limiting
their availability.
   But the National Captioning Institute on Tuesday announced a $1
million project to spur development of TVs with built-in decoders,
saying it would bring closed-captioned programming to millions more
Americans _ with and without hearing problems.
   ``TV sets with the decoder chip built-in will be attractive to
people who find captioned television helpful in learning English,''
said NCI Chairman Warren H. Simmons Jr. ``We're speaking of
immigrants learning English as a second language, as well as
children who have reading problems.''
   The built-in decoder initially would add only about $20 to the
cost of a television, with costs eventually becoming negligible,
the institute predicted.
   ``By the mid '90s, we hope virtually all TV sets, at least color
TV, mid-to-large screen size models, will be available with
captioning as a welcomed new feature,'' Simmons said.
   The institute, a non-profit corporation set up to provide
closed-captioned television service, awarded ITT Corp. a $1 million
contract to design, develop and produce the tiny decoder chip that
could be built into new TVs, VCRs and cable converters.
   The grant was announced at Gallaudet University, the only
accredited liberal arts college for the hearing impaired. Gallaudet
President I. King Jordan said captioning ``expands the world for
our deaf students. It's also valuable for many others, such as the
elderly experiencing hearing loss and those recently arrived in
America and learning English.''
   ``I look forward to the day when captioning can be taken for
granted as a right for all Americans,'' Jordan said.
   NCI President John Ball estimated the decoder chips could be
available to TV manufacturers by late 1990 and that televisions
equipped with the devices could be on the market by late 1991 or
1992.
   Sharad Rastogi, director of marketing for ITT's semiconductor
division, said TV manufacturers see the built-in decoders as a
attractive, low-cost marketing feature and are anxious to
incorporate the new technology.
   Closed captioning converts the audio portions of a television
program into written words, which are displayed on the television
screen, similar to the subtitles that appear on foreign-language
films. The captions can be switched on and off at the viewer's
option.
   Nearly 300 hours of closed-captioned programming are available
weekly on major networks and through cable services. Many
videotapes also are captioned.
   The National Captioning Institute said it plans to manufacture
separate closed-captioned decoders through the end of the century.
Ball estimated about 250,000 decoders are now in use. He said the
disadvantages of the separate decoder are its price and the
complexity of hooking up another device to the TV, in addition to
VCRs and cable converters.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately Wednesday, while the dollar inched down against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 111.48 points, or 0.32
percent, to 35,107.56. It had gained 527.39 points Tuesday, the
second-largest one-day gain this year. The largest rise was a
793.96 gain on Mar. 28.
   The dollar ended at 142.10 yen, down 0.15 yen from Tuesday's
142.25-yen close. It started higher at 142.55 yen and moved between
142.05 yen and 142.63 yen during the day.
   Earlier trading was mixed, and prices hit a plateau when some
investors sold issues for arbitrage deals to make profits, but the
Nikkei index rose quickly as participants picked up steel,
construction and food issues, said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a dealer with
New Japan Securities, Co., Ltd. in Tokyo.
   He said the Tokyo market did not react negatively to news
reports shortly after the market's opening about a severe
earthquake in the San Francisco area, measuring 6.9 on the Richter
scale.
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained higher following its
strength in New York despite a larger-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit reported Tuesday, traders said.
   The deficit rose to $10.77 billion in August, up from a revised
$8.24 billion in July.
   ``The exchange rates moved little as market players had no idea
why the dollar remained strong despite negative news to the
dollar,'' including Friday's stock plunge and a widened trade
deficit, said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Because market players were inclined to avoid making major
moves, the currency fluctuation remained small,'' he said.
   The trader said the news about the earthquake in San Francisco
had only a small effect although some American speculative
investors sold the dollar because of the disaster.

   Federal bank regulators are investigating the
legality of large political contributions from a Phoenix
millionaire to five senators who intervened on behalf of his failed
savings and loan association.
   ``We will be looking at every piece of evidence we can find to
determine whether or not laws were violated with respect to
political contributions'' by Charles H. Keating, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said Tuesday in sworn
testimony before the House Banking Committee.
   Keating, chairman of American Continental Corp., the parent
company of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
gave money to the campaigns of Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   In April 1987, the five met with regulators on Keating's behalf.
   DeConcini and Riegle have since returned Keating's
contributions, but the citizens' group Common Cause last week asked
the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the matter.
   Common Cause also asked the Justice Department to determine
whether the contributions violated the law, but Seidman's statement
is the first sign that a federal agency is actively pursuing the
matter.
   Meanwhile, Seidman suggested strongly that the government waited
three years too long before trying to contain the Lincoln failure,
expected to be the nation's costliest.
   The FDIC chief said if his agency had been regulating Lincoln it
would have sought in 1986 to take it over or issue an order
stopping abuses.
   That would have prevented some of what Seidman estimates will be
a $1.5 billion to $2 billion loss to taxpayers. The government took
control of the thrift in April.
   ``We're looking at the biggest bank heist in history,'' said
Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, at the first of four scheduled hearings on
Lincoln.
   Seidman refrained from directly criticizing M. Danny Wall, the
top U.S. thrift regulator. But his assessment raised questions
about Wall's decision to delay action against Lincoln from
mid-1987, when he took office, until April 14 of this year.
   Lincoln was seized by Wall's agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, and turned over the FDIC, which insures bank and S&amp;L
deposits. Last month the government filed a $1.1 billion civil
fraud and racketeering suit charging that Keating, his family and
associates diverted Lincoln's deposits for their personal use.
   A March 12, 1986, examination by the San Francisco branch of the
bank board found that Lincoln had violated rules limiting risky
direct investments in commercial ventures, was not in compliance
with accounting standards, had substantial loan losses, had
inadequate and missing records and was speculating in junk bonds.
   ``My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of
our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate
cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations,'' Seidman
said.
   The focus of the House panel's probe is Wall's decision, after
meeting with Keating, to order a second examination by
Washington-based regulators to confirm the findings of the San
Francisco office, delaying action against the thrift.
   However, committee chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said he has not ruled out asking the senators to appear before the
panel if later testimony shows their intervention caused the delay.
   Gonzalez said Cranston offered about a month ago to appear
before the committee. Riegle issued a statement saying he was
providing information to the Senate ethics panel and was prepared
to share the same information with the House.
   Seidman also testified it was ``fairly clear'' Keating was
tipped off to the April 14 seizure because a day earlier American
Continental filed for bankruptcy, complicating government efforts
to recover part of the cost of the S&amp;L failure.
   Additional hearings are scheduled Oct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.
Keating and Wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session.

<HEAD>Oil Tankers Without Spill Plans to be Barred From Valdez</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tanker operators will have to have
state-approved plans outlining how they would respond to oil spills
in Prince William Sound or they will be barred from loading oil in
Valdez, officials said.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies that
operates the trans-Alaska pipeline terminal in Valdez, has been
ordered not to load tankers without approved plans after Nov. 13,
said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   ``Be ready to contain and clean up a spill and demonstrate it
with an approved plan _ that is the message,'' Kelso said in a
statement Monday.
   Letters warning of the new policy were sent last week to those
chartering, owning or operating tankers in the sound, where the
tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil March
24, creating the nation's largest oil spill.
   A response plan must show details including how workers and
equipment will be deployed to a spill, the methods of cleanup,
disposal and communications and response times, Kelso said.
   Officials previously assumed that tankers going in and out of
Valdez _ the southern end of the pipeline _ were covered by
Alyeska's spill-response plan, said Larry Dietrick, director of the
department's Division of Environmental Quality in Juneau.
   But there were problems in the early days of the Exxon Valdez
cleanup, and since then, Alyeska has said its obligation is limited
to the initial response after the spill, not the long-term efforts.
   In the future, if a tanker is claimed to be covered under
Alyeska's response plan, its owners must show evidence that Alyeska
will respond fully to its spills, Kelso said.

<HEAD>US Will Continue to Produce Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. arms control official says the Bush
administration is ``looking after the national security of the
United States'' by deciding to make new chemical weapons while it
seeks an international ban on the deadly weapons.
   ``It is not good to cut programs in anticipation of negotiations
_ that undercuts your negotiation leverage, it undercuts your
security,'' Ronald Lehman, head of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, told reporters.
   Lehman said the key to U.S. elimination of its older chemical
weapons is to get other nations have to eliminate theirs, ``and
until they are committed to such a thing, we will have a stock,
albeit a very small stock.''
   ``So we will be continuing our production program. The president
has asked us to look at how we would structure the program, how we
would implement this in the context of the overall negotiations,''
Lehman said.
   ``You don't have to be born yesterday to understand ... we have
taken a big step here, but we're also looking after the national
security of the United States,'' Lehman said.
   Recent news reports, citing unnamed administration officials,
said President Bush has signed an order allowing the continued
production of a new generation of chemical weapons for an
unspecified period of time.
   Bush told the United Nations last month the United States and
the Soviet Union should cut their existing chemical weapons
stockpiles by 80 percent as an impetus to the negotiations in
Geneva on curbing chemical weapons.
   The president did not mention his decision on production in his
U.N. speech.
   In 1984, Bush _ as vice president _ carried a draft text to the
Geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical
weapons ban cease producing such arms right away and destroy their
stockpiles over a 10-year period. The international talks, in which
40 nations are taking part, resume next month.
   A draft of the international treaty calls for the immediate end
to the production of such weapons.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine on Monday
criticized Bush's stance on producing new chemical weapons, calling
it ``a major step backwards'' that threatens the international
negotiations.
   Lehman said the threat of chemical weapons ``needs to be
addressed and our policy has been to seek a total ban on the
production and storage and use of these weapons.''
   But he stressed the administration also has been ``quite clear''
and told Congress it intends ``to maintain our binary program.''
   Binary chemical weapons consist of two non-lethal chemicals that
become deadly when mixed.
   Lehman said the administration made progress on the issue during
the recent U.S.-Soviet talks in Wyoming and as a result of that
session the two superpowers will begin exchanging data on the
location and types of stocks and amounts that the two sides have
before the end of this year.
   But Soviets diplomats, speaking privately, have said the Kremlin
is concerned about Bush's decision to continue production of the
new generation of chemical weapons.
   Under Bush's U.N. proposal, the two superpowers would reduce
their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current
U.S. level.
   Only the United States, the Soviet Union and Iraq acknowledge
having chemical weapons, but more than 20 nations are believed to
have them or have the capability to produce them.

<TEXT>
   A Democrat's victory in a special
congressional runoff election has given Mississippi its first
all-Democratic House delegation in 17 years.
   State Sen. Gene Taylor defeated Republican Tom Anderson on
Tuesday to claim the seat left vacant by the death of freshman Rep.
Larkin Smith, a Republican who died in an Aug. 13 plane crash.
   It was the fifth victory by a Democrat in seven special
congressional elections held around the nation this year. The
reclaiming of Mississippi's lone GOP House seat left Democratic
congressional leaders exultant.
   ``I think that is a major turnaround for the Democrats,
especially in the Deep South and in Mississippi,'' said Rep. Beryl
Anthony Jr., D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. ``It's a major win for the Democrats; it's a
major loss and embarrassment for the Republicans.''
   Taylor, 36, of Bay St. Louis, will serve the final 14 months of
Smith's term.
   ``I think realistically something very American happened,''
Taylor said. ``The citizens chose a candidate rather than the big
power brokers in Washington and the big money interests.''
   Anderson, 43, a longtime aide to U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, who once
held the 5th Congressional District seat, received vocal support
from Lott and from President Bush.
   Unofficial results showed Taylor carrying 11 of the 12 counties
in the district in the southeastern corner of the state.
   With all 372 precincts reported, unofficial results gave Taylor
83,093 votes, or 65 percent, to Anderson's 44,430 votes, or 35
percent.
   ``We came from nowhere, we worked hard. It's been the longest 50
days of my life,'' Anderson said. ``What we probably needed was a
little more time.''
   Taylor said he planned to travel today to Washington to meet
with House Speaker Tom Foley and other Democratic leaders. He wanst
to be sworn in next Tuesday.
   In an Oct. 3 primary, Taylor received 42 percent of the vote and
Anderson 37 percent to advance to Tuesday's runoff. State Attorney
General Mike Moore, a Democrat, got 21 percent and was eliminated.

<HEAD>Psychiatric Association Votes To Readmit Soviets Conditionally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAIRE SPRINGETT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Psychiatric Association today
conditionally readmitted the Soviet Union after a Soviet official
acknowledged that pyschiatry had been abused in his homeland for
political reasons.
   But the body said the official Soviet organization could be
ousted if an investigation finds that the Soviets still use
psychiatry as a political weapon against dissidents.
   Delegates at the eighth World Psychiatric Congress in Athens
voted 291-45 with 19 abstentions early today to conditionally
readmit the Soviet All-Union Society of Psychiatrists and
Narcologists.
   The psychiatric congress also admitted a second Soviet group,
the Independent Psychiatric Association, which was set up several
months ago by psychiatrists who wanted to distance themselves from
alleged abuses by the official All-Union Society.
   The independent association was admitted unanimously with no
conditions.
   No members of the independent group attended the congress
because they were unable to get visas in time, congress sources
said.
   The All-Union Society withdrew from the World Psychiatric
Congress in 1983 to avoid expulsion because of allegations
dissidents were being certified as insane.
   Wednesday's decision empowers a world congress delegation to
visit the Soviet Union within the next year to investigate whether
the political use of psychiatry has ended.
   If the delegation finds abuses, a special meeting of the
congress would be convened to consider suspending the All-Union
Society.
   ``I think ... the conditions will allow us to assess whether or
not there has been an amelioration in the political use of
psychiatry in the Soviet Union,'' said Dr. Melvin Sabshin, medical
director of the American Psychiatric Association.
   The move to admit the Soviet Union came after Peter Morozov, the
Soviet representative, acknowledged that psychiatry had been used
for political purposes.
   His group ``acknowledges that previous political conditions
created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred,
including political,'' Morozov told the congress before his
delegation left the hall for the vote.
   The Soviet Union publicly admitted the political abuse of
psychiatry had previously referred to breaches of professional
ethics and the law as ``non-medical use'' of psychiatry.
   Morozov told The Associated Press on Monday: ``It is clear we
regret our past, not only (political) abuses but the whole system.''
   There was heated debate over whether to readmit the Soviet group.
   The most strident opposition came from Dr. James Birley,
president of the British Royal College of Physicians, who said
``the Soviet group is run by the (Soviet) Foreign Office. ... I
have only been given contact with Foreign Office officials in my
attempts to have talks with Soviet psychiatrists.''
   A U.S. delegation of psychiatrists led by a State Department
official visited the Soviet Union in February to investigate Soviet
claims that psychiatry was no longer being abused.
   The group noted in a report that despite some progress, more
legal safeguards were needed to prevent the hospitalization of
dissidents.
   A Soviet official told a U.S. congressional panel earlier this
month that an eight-member commission had been set up to prevent
the use of psychiatry for ``non-medical reasons.''
   But on Monday a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news
conference in Athens that the authorities were ``still looking''
for professionals to become members of the commission, which he
said was not a part of any government department or organization.
   The Netherlands-based International Association on the Political
Use of Psychiatry, which campaigned against the Soviets'
readmission, claims to have evidence that 40 dissidents are still
being held in Soviet psychiatric institutions.
   And Amnesty International said in a report released today that
an Amnesty delegation that visited the Soviet Union in March found
100 cases in which people were in psychiatric institutions for
political reasons.
   It said more such cases had emerged since.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush's `Evolving' Position on Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few domestic issues give President Bush more
apparent agony or political grief than coming to grips with
abortion.
   ``It's an issue he's very uncomfortable with,'' conceded a
senior Bush aide as the president's position took its latest twist
_ a Tuesday announcement that he would veto a bill expanding
federally funded abortions to cases of incest and rape.
   Bush urged Congress not to use tax dollars to ``compound a
violent act with the taking of an unborn life'' just days after he
told a news conference there may be ``room for flexibility'' in his
stand.
   The dispute involves a House-passed provision that would expand
Medicaid coverage for poor women to include abortions in cases of
rape and incest.
   The present law _ which Bush wants retained _ only permits
public funding when the pregnant woman's life is in danger.
   White House aides were backing and filling this week to show
that Bush's position has remained unchanged _ almost _ for many
years.
   The president's ``position's not the same _ I mean is the same _
is the same. Freudian slip,'' said presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, fielding one question after another on the
subject.
   In fact, Bush has wavered several times on critical abortion
issues, and many Bush loyalists were privately conceding that the
president may now have painted himself into a political corner as
public opinion polls seem to reflect growing resistance to tighter
restrictions.
   Although saying he has long morally opposed abortion, Bush as
recently as his 1980 Republican presidential campaign voiced clear
opposition to a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme
Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortions.
   That position put him at odds with Ronald Reagan, and sometime
after Bush joined the GOP ticket as Reagan's running mate he
abandoned his opposition to an amendment. Since then, he has
embraced just such an amendment.
   ``You know, there has been _ I have to make a confession _ an
evolution in my position,'' he told a 1984 campaign debate with
Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
   In a campaign debate last year with Democrat Michael Dukakis,
Bush said his opposition to abortion was hardened as he watched the
christening of adopted granddaughter Marshall _ now 3 years old _
in a Virginia church.
   ``I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that
child, and put the child up for adoption,'' he said.
   Bush experienced another apparent shift _ this one overnight
rather than over the years _ after suggesting in another 1988
debate with Dukakis that women who have abortions could be
subjected to criminal penalties if the procedure were outlawed.
   His top lieutenants circulated the next morning insisting that
Bush, upon reflection, had decided that such penalties should not
be imposed.
   Bush's current position is one of flat opposition to federally
funded abortions for poor women except when their lives are
endangered.
   But this does not seem to square with his general view in
support of a ``human life'' amendment that would also allow
abortions in the case of rape or incest.
   Bush, in a letter on Tuesday to Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
tried anew to explain this apparent contradiction, claiming the nub
of the matter was who was paying the bill.
   ``Abortion is a difficult, often painful, and very personal
decision for all Americans. It is made even more difficult when the
underlying issue is whether the government _ and ultimately the
American taxpayer _ is asked to pay for abortions and under what
circumstances,'' he said.
   But Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said that position showed a ``timid
president who wouldn't lift a glove to get rid of (Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio) Noriega ... who now tries to show his
political backbone by pushing around poor women who are the victims
of rape and incest.''
   In defense of the president, Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who also
favors sharp abortion restrictions, said the president took ``a
very principled, albeit very difficult, stand.''

   Commuters found themselves driving at a
``50-degree angle'' to the roadbed when an earthquake rippled
through the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and shook loose a
30-foot section.
   ``First I thought my shocks weren't working,'' said Susie Allen.
``Then I realized the car wasn't having problems; the ground was
having problems.
   ``The road rose up to meet me,'' said Ms. Allen, who was headed
from her office in San Francisco to Oakland, where she lives. ``I
couldn't figure out why the road was at a 50-degree angle to my
face.''
   Ms. Allen, 26, stopped her car, locked it, and with other
motorists began walking the 150 yards toward the huge gap in the
top level of the span, which collapsed onto the bottom level.
   ``There was a car hanging off the edge with one tail light
blinking,'' Ms. Allen said.
   The Bay Bridge is made up of two spans; one between San
Francisco and Treasure Island and the other connecting the island
to Oakland. The span of roadway that collapsed was on the Oakland
side of Treasure Island.
   ``We started walking back toward Treasure Island, but hordes of
people kept coming back toward us,'' Ms. Allen said.
   Officers from the Treasure Island Naval Reserve told Ms. Allen
and the other motorists to return to their cars, where they waited
for about two hours until an exodus from the bridge was organized.
   ``You could see smoke from fires around the area,'' she said.
``At one point we watched a helicopter. They lowered a stretcher to
a Coast Guard boat to pick up somebody they'd fished out of the
water.''
   Ms. Allen returned to San Francisco, where she spent the night
with friends.

<HEAD>Federal Government Starts Belt-Tightening Under Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 7th graf to clarify money, not cuts would be restored to
budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare patients and college students are
among those who will take a financial hit because the White House
and Congress don't agree on how to cut the federal budget deficit,
officials say.
   The automatic federal spending cuts _ which took effect Tuesday
in place of a budget agreement _ will have substantial effects
elsewhere in the government if the reductions stand. However, most
agencies report it would take a while for the cuts to trickle down
even if efforts to resolve the impasse fail.
   ``Other than general restraint on spending, nothing's on hold,''
a Commerce Department official said Tuesday, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law orders spending cuts
totaling $16.1 billion in the 1990 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
   ``We are waiting to see what Congress does,'' said spokesman
Pete Williams of the Defense Department, which was hit with half
the reductions.
   Labor Department spokesman Tracy Dennison said the department is
studying ways to trim $465 million ``but it will probably be
sometime down the road before we can say exactly what we'll be
doing.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater raised the
prospect that President Bush might not accept legislation restoring
the money to the budget.
   ``There is some feeling here that they are the way to go,'' he
told reporters. ``It will reduce spending in a very effective
fashion.''
   House and Senate leaders, meanwhile, looked for a way out of the
dilemma.
   The Senate has passed a deficit-reduction bill with almost
nothing else attached to it. But the House version includes a horde
of controversial provisions ranging from child care assistance to
the Fairness Doctrine in broadcasting.
   If Congress and Bush fail to agree soon, federal employees and
many taxpayers would feel the effects of the cuts.
   For example, the Labor Department would delay employee transfers
unless absolutely necessary and some new programs could be
postponed.
   The Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and other agencies with
personnel-oriented budgets would have to furlough workers because
the deficit-reduction law prohibits cutting employee salaries.
   ``As a practical matter ... we probably don't have to consider
that for 30 to 45 days,'' said Pentagon spokesman Williams.
   At the Department of Health and Human Services, Dennis Williams,
deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the most immediate
effect of the cuts will be on Medicare.
   ``For everybody else, it will be a cumulative impact over
time,'' Williams said.
   Doctors and hospitals that participate in the Medicare program
will see a reduction of 2.092 percent in their payments, he said.
In addition, some people who submit their bills directly to
Medicare will have to cover the 2.092 percent themselves.
   Medicare is taking a total $1.7 billion cut, while defense
spending accounted for a $8.1 billion reduction.
   Medicaid payments to states are exempt from the budget cuts, as
are Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and Aid to
Families with Dependent Children.
   Sally Christensen, director of Budget Service for the Education
Department, said the student loan program is the only education
program immediately affected by the budget cuts.
   The law raises the loan origination fee from 5 percent to 5.5
percent and cuts the special allowance payment to lending
institutions from 3.25 percent to 3 percent, Ms. Christensen said.
With these changes, banks will make less of a profit and students
will pay more for taking out a loan.
   Dennis Kaplan, chief of budget control and analysis for the
Agriculture Department, said it is widely believed there that
Congress will soon work out a budget agreement to replace the
automatic cuts.
   If not, he said, the Food Safety and Inspection Service ``will
probably furlough a lot of their employees, but that won't occur
until August or September'' of next year.
   The same would be true of the Forest Service and Farmers Home
Administration, he said.
   Much of the Agriculture Department's spending is exempt from the
cuts, including food stamps, school lunches and other child
nutrition programs.
   At the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees 16,800
air traffic controllers, spokesman John Leyden said there would be
no immediate impact other than pulling back on hirings,
procurements and changes of status for personnel.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget said a prolonged
impasse might force the layoff of air traffic controllers for three
days a month and a reduction in military forces by 160,000.

<HEAD>Think Tank Says 14.5 Million US AIDS Cases Possible by 2002</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There may be 14.5 million Americans infected
with the AIDS virus by the year 2002 unless stronger measures are
taken to combat a growing epidemic, the Hudson Institute predicts
in what it calls ``a dark view of the future.''
   Hudson, a conservative think tank, released a report Tuesday
based on a 2{-year study of the progress of the nation's fight
against AIDS and warned ``a catastrophe is sweeping over America.''
   The study warns: ``If the nation shrinks from taking responsible
action now to contain the ... epidemic, it tacitly will be
accepting a disaster of immense proportions.
   ``Unchecked, AIDS will kill more Americans in the next decade
than have died in combat in all of the nation's wars since our
founding,'' the study said. ``Already AIDS has claimed the lives of
as many Americans as did the Vietnam War.''
   The Centers for Disease Control reports AIDS has been diagnosed
in more than 100,000 Americans and almost 60,000 have died. These
numbers do not include Americans who are only infected with the
AIDS virus and not experiencing symptoms that would classify the
case as AIDS. The Hudson study estimates are based on all people
who are infected with human immuniodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes AIDS.
   William B. Johnston, co-author of the study and vice president
of Hudson, said the report studied three possible scenarios and
drew up mathematical models to project possible consequences.
   In the worst case, the report said there would be some 1.4
million new HIV infections annually in the United States.
   This worst case, said Johnston, assumes no vaccine is developed
and there are no major changes in current social-sexual behavior.
   Even with the best case, which Johnston said would include a
vaccine by the middle of the 1990s and ``remarkable behavioral
changes throughout society,'' the report predicts there will be
30,000 new HIV infections annually by 2002. There would be about
1.6 million Americans with the disease that year under this
scenario, the report said.
   ``The middle case, which is the most reasonable,'' said
Johnston, ``gives us about 6 million'' cases of HIV infection.
   That case assumes some changes in social-sexual behavior with a
vaccine available by the year 2002.
   Johnston said widespread, voluntary, free HIV tests for all
people between the 15 and 65 would be the primary factor in
controlling the epidemic. This will help establish the ``HIV
status'' of all sexually active people, he said.
   ``By encouraging massive, routine, voluntary testing, we can
enable society voluntarily to segregate itself sexually into two
groups: those who carry the virus and those who do not,'' the
report said. ``No other means is likely to alter the course of the
HIV epidemic.''
   Because of the ``biological dynamics'' of HIV, the report said,
the disease can be controlled ``in a society that is not
universally monogamous'' only by limiting sexual contact between
the infected and the uninfected.
   ``The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners,'' the
study said.
   The study said it is ``equally important,'' however, to protect
the rights and privacy of all people in society.
   In all three scenarios, the AIDS epidemic would be most
disastrous to black Americans, the study said.
   Under the worst case, the researchers forecast by the year 2002
almost 42 percent of the black population aged 15 to 50 would be
infected with HIV. Under the best case, infection among that same
group would be 1.5 percent, while the rate in the middle case would
be 15.5 percent.
   For Hispanics of the same age, the infection rate would be 9.2
percent for the worst case; 3.3 percent for the middle case, and 1
percent in the best case.
   The same numbers for the white population would be 2.9 percent,
worst case; 0.8 percent, middle case, and 0.1 percent, best case.
   Currently, the study estimated that there are 1.1 million
Americans infected with HIV. This is about 0.9 percent of the total
population.
   Comment on the report was requested from officials at the
National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease, the lead
agency in the National Institutes of Health in the battle against
AIDS, and from the National Cancer Institute, where the virus was
first isolated in this country. Officials, however, did not return
the calls.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an incurable
contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. It is
spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
infected pregnant women to their offspring.

   A committee of the Illinois House
blocked a bill to restrict abortions in the state in a vote that
pro-choice legislators said would kill the issue for this year.
   Abortion opponents in the General Assembly, however, said they
would ask for a vote in the full House.
   In Pennsylvania, legislation to impose more restrictions on
abortions passed a committee Tuesday on a 16-7 vote, clearing the
way for full debate by that state's House.
   Tuesday's vote by the Illinois House's Rules Committee blocked a
bill similar to the Missouri legislature's restrictions on
abortion, which were upheld in July by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Democratic Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, a leading abortion-rights
lawmaker, predicted the panel's vote would hold.
   ``This looked to me like a pretty solid, pretty strong, pretty
clear signal that (the bill) will not be considered in the
Legislature during the fall veto session,'' Flynn said.
   But Republican Rep. Penny Pullen, a leader of anti-abortion
forces in the assembly, said it was ``wrong for a single committee
to hold (the bill) without having any opportunity for the members
of the House and Senate to express their opinions.''
   Nine of the 18 lawmakers on the rules committee voted to move
the abortion bill to the full House, but that was one vote short of
the required majority of 10. Eight lawmakers voted against further
action and one was absent.
   The panel's approval was required for further action on abortion
legislation in the fall session, which is limited to emergency
legislation and action on the governor's vetoes.
   A draft of the bill would require doctors to determine the
viability of a fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older before
performing an abortion, and require that a second physician be
present for abortions of viable fetuses.
   It also would bar public employees and public facilities from
direct involvement in abortions, except when performed to save the
life of the mother.
   The bill required three-fifths majorities in both houses of the
assembly to reach the governor's desk.
   Before the committee vote Gov. James R. Thompson had warned
lawmakers against hasty action on the abortion legislation. He
declined to take a position on the measure.
   In the past, the Republican governor has vetoed most abortion
restrictions on constitutional grounds.
   The Pennsylvania bill would ban abortions after the 24th week of
pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother. It also would
prohibit abortions based on the sex of a fetus and require women in
most cases to notify their husbands if they plan to get an abortion.
   The bill, approved by the House Judiciary Committee, also calls
for a 24-hour waiting period for abortions.
   Democrat Robert O'Donnell, the majority leader, has said the
House will consider the measure Oct. 24.

   Supporters of a bill calling for wider use of
the death penalty in federal crimes say a last-minute addition
designed to avert racial bias could scuttle the whole bill.
   ``Make no mistake, it's a killer amendment,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., declared Tuesday as the Senate Judiciary
Committee debated the measure.
   The committee agreed to send the legislation to the Senate floor
for action at a time which has not been determined.
   But the committee first voted, 7-6, to adopt an amendment,
sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., which would allow
defendants to use statistical evidence of racial bias in their
efforts to escape the death penalty.
   In sending the measure to the floor, the committee did not
recommend whether it should be passed.
   The legislation would bring into line with Supreme Court rulings
existing federal law that calls for the death penalty for offenses
including murder, treason, espionage, air piracy and certain deaths
involving explosives.
   The bill would for the first time authorize the death penalty
for attempts to assassinate the president, murder by a federal
prisoner serving a life term, taking a hostage if the hostage or a
would-be rescuer ends up being killed, genocide and murder for hire
or in aid of racketeering.
   The Bush administration had sought such a measure as part of its
anticrime package.
   Democratic leaders promised Senate action on the death penalty
and other elements in the crime package before Congress adjourns
for the year.
   Broader use of the death penalty called for by the bill would
involve only federal cases. But Kennedy's amendment would also
apply to state cases.
   It would allow defense attorneys to present to the court state
statistics showing lopsided application of the death penalty
against racial minorities. Prosecutors would then have to
demonstrate that bias was not involved before capital punishment
could be imposed.
   Kennedy said after the committee meeting that his provision was
``certainly not a killer amendment.''
   ``I don't know why it would be,'' Kennedy said. ``If the state
courts don't apply (the death penalty) in a racial way, what's the
problem?''
   After the amendment was adopted, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
voted against the bill. Democrats said more Republicans may oppose
the measure rather than accept the racial provision.
   Thurmond acknowledged it would cause problems for the measure.
   ``I don't see how you can vote for his amendment if you believe
in a death penalty at all,'' he said.
   American Indian groups oppose the legislation, saying 47 percent
of all first-degree murder cases prosecuted in federal courts from
July 1987 through June 1988 arose on Indian reservations.
   The New Mexico-based All Indian Pueblo Council in August
approved a resolution urging lawmakers to vote against it.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., told the
committee he would offer an amendment addressing the Indians'
concern when the legislation reaches the Senate floor.

<HEAD>Boren Backs Removing `Chilling Effect' on CIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee says it is time to remove an unintended ``chilling
effect'' on the CIA that results from a ban on U.S. involvement in
assassination plots.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said Tuesday he welcomes President
Bush's desire to clarify what the ban means and what restrictions
it should _ and should not _ place on American intelligence
operatives.
   ``The CIA is suffering the aftershocks of Vietnam and of the
Iran-Contra affair,'' Boren said in an interview. ``There has grown
to be a built-in cultural reticence'' to become involved in plots
such as the failed Oct. 3 coup in Panama against dictator Manuel
Noriega.
   That coup, while not directly raising the question of
assassination, has prompted the administration to review its policy
on U.S. participation in plots that could lead to the death of a
foreign leader.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration will propose changes that would not fundamentally
alter the 13-year-old assassination ban, but would make it easier
for the CIA to be in contact with plotters of a coup.
   Other administration officials have said they want to offer
clear guidance to permit activities which, while they may involve a
risk of death to a particular official, do not amount to a
premeditated murder plot.
   ``We want the agency to be aggressive about entering into
discussions, and not just passive collectors of intelligence,''
said Boren, who conceded that he was more hawkish on the issue than
some of his colleagues on the intelligence oversight committees.
   Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the committee's senior Republican,
said it is ``entirely proper'' for the administration to re-examine
its guidelines for intelligence officials. He said he did not
believe Congress ever intended to prevent them from a dialogue with
those who might be plotting a coup.
   ``If a person might be killed incidental to (a coup), that's
quite a bit different'' from a premeditated assassination, he said.
   But he cautioned that the ban itself should not be disturbed.
``I don't want to see us getting into the assassination business by
another name,'' Cohen said.
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., a member of the House Intelligence
Committee, said he agreed there may be room for clarifying what
constitutes participation in an assassination.
   But he added: ``If it is any weakening of the prohibition on
assassination at the initiation of the U.S. government, it is not
likely to be acceptable to Congress or to the American public.''
   Following the failed Panamanian coup, administration officials
complained that CIA officers in Panama were essentially prevented
from advising the coup plotters because of the possibility that
Noriega might be killed.
   When the rebel leaders outlined their plans to the CIA, the
agency failed to ask essential questions about their intentions and
tactics. When they asked for support in blocking roads, U.S.
officials felt unable to respond.
   President Bush, at a news conference last week, indicated he
wanted to see the restrictions relaxed. ``I want as broad a power
as possible and I think under the Constitution, the president has
it,'' he said on Friday.
   Bush said his powers were ``broader than some in the Senate or
House might think,'' adding, ``I may have a difference with some on
interpreting what the powers of the president might be.'' Boren
said the subject came up when he and Cohen met with Bush last week,
and he invited the president to submit any new guidelines to his
panel.
   The executive order prohibiting U.S. involvement in
assassination attempts was signed by President Ford in 1976 after
congressional investigations detailed the CIA's role in
assassination plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro and
others. The order was strengthened by President Carter and
continued without change by President Reagan.

   A downtown emergency shelter drew a mixed
group of about 100 stranded tourists, conventioneers and residents
from nearby transient hotels who fled pitch dark streets looking
for a safe place to spend the night.
   No food or cots were available in the makeshift Red Cross
shelter late Tuesday in the ballroom of the Moscone Convention
Center, near the heart of the city's financial district and near
major rail and bus terminals.
   People ousted from their hotels or unable to reach them rested
their heads on tables set for conventioneers. Others stretched out
in corners trying to sleep.
   An emergency power supply provided dim lighting in the
underground convention center.
   The Red Cross had no food to offer, but volunteers were trying
to find some, combing nearby streets for any small market that
might be open despite the lack of electricity.
   ``Once you (provide) food, everything else becomes secondary,''
said shelter manager Theresa Hull, adding that she hoped those
foraging for food could at least buy some peanut butter and jelly
for sandwiches
   Radio notices informed those seeking safe haven about the
shelter, thought to be the city's only Red Cross outpost in the
first night following the devastating quake. Others said they were
directed there by police officers on the street.
   The mood in the dimly lighted ballroom was one of shock as
people recalled the wave of Earth movement.
   ``I thought it was a train going across the building,'' said
Phyllis Shook, a tourist from Des Moines, Iowa. ``It had a roar.''
   ``We heard an explosion and it turned out to be concrete from
the walls and windows blowing out,'' said Kim House, of San Jose,
who was walking in the San Francisco's Tenderloin district with her
fiancee when the quake hit.
   ``At first we thought it was a bomb and that's when all hell
broke loose. People were running out the buildings.''
   Douglas Schmillen, a transient staying at hotel where the city
refers the homeless, was lying on his bed when the tremor struck.
   ``The bed moved from one side (of the room) to the other,''
Schmillen said. ``I didn't know if the walls were going to come
down next.''
   Schmillen said he was evacuated from the hotel because of a gas
leak and the lack of electricity.
   Bob Witzgall, a conventioneer from Sacramento, said he was in
the shower of his Union Square hotel room when the earthquake hit.
   ``It was scary. I couldn't get out of there fast enough,''
Witzgall said. ``It started out as a little rumble, but it was
pretty violent where I was.''
   Lack of electricity and fears of being stranded on the street
all night sent Witzgall back to the shelter.
   ``I'm going to stay here until the power is back on and once
it's back on, I think I'll get in my car and leave,'' he said.
   Frank Odill, a Milwaukee visitor traveling with his wife, said
he was grateful they did not have to spend the night in total
darkness.
   ``At least here we've got power and light,'' he said, but his
wife, Betty, was less able to see a bright side.
   ``I can't wait to leave,'' she said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's letter to
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., outlining his opposition to a bill
that would extend Medicaid benefits to pay for abortions for
victims of rape or incest. Byrd is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill.
   Dear Bob,
   As the Senate begins consideration of H.R. 2990, the conference
report accompanying the Department of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Appropriations bill for
(fiscal year) 1990, I want you to know that I will not sign the
measure should it include language that expands federal funding for
abortion beyond that which has been current law sine 1981.
   My position on the issue of abortion is clear. I support a
constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court's
decision in Roe v. Wade. I also support a human life amendment with
an exception for rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is
threatened. I do not support federal funding of abortions except
where the mother's life is threatened.
   As H.R. 2990 progressed through the legislative process, my
senior advisors indicated that they would recommend I veto the
measure if it included expanded federal funding for abortion beyond
the life of the mother exception. Although I wrote a letter to
members of Congress clearly expressing my concerns during
consideration of the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for
FY 1990, I nonetheless asked my senior advisors to take another
look at this complex issue, particularly the role of public funds,
consistent, though, with my position as stated above.
   This decision is one that I have not reached easily or lightly.
   Many citizens and members of Congress were consulted as this
question was reviewed. Abortion is a difficult, often painful, and
very personal decision for all Americans. It is made even more
difficult when the underlying issue is whether the government _ and
ultimately the American taxpayer _ is asked to pay for abortions
and under what circumstances. Since 1981, the federal government
has determined, I think wisely, that taxpayer funds should be used
for abortion in only the most narrow of circumstances: where the
life of the mother is endangered. If abortion funding were expanded
to include other circumstances, it would be difficult to limit to
the few cases of actual rape or incest, and could have the
unintended consequence of allowing the taking of countless other
lives of unborn children well beyond the few cases argued as
reasons for the proposed legislative change.
   My intense personal concern for those women who are victims of
the crimes of rape and incest is as strongly felt as my position on
abortion. Rape and incest are crimes of violence which must not go
unpunished, and those convicted of such crimes must be brought to
justice.
   The question raised by H.R. 2990, however, involves whether the
federal government and American taxpayers should be forced to pay
for the termination of an unborn child's life in the case of rape
or incest. That such a child may have been conceived through an
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and,
indeed, agonizing; it does not, however, alter the basic fact that
Federal funding is being sought that would compound a violent act
with the taking of an unborn life. And in the absence of perfect
legislation that would reconcile these difficult issues, if I have
to err, I prefer to err on the side of human life.
   For these reasons, should H.R. 2990 reach my desk with language
expanding federal funding of abortion, I will veto the measure and
return it to Congress.

<HEAD>All-White Academy Plans on Playing Game Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An all-white high school academy has
agreed to play a football game against a school that has a black
player, reversing a decision that had prompted several team members
to quit.
   The headmaster of the all-white East Holmes Academy said he
decided not to cancel Friday's game against Columbus Heritage
Academy after the Mississippi Private School Association threatened
to expel the school.
   Headmaster Frank Drake continued to insist that the earlier
decision to cancel the game wasn't based on racism. However, he
wouldn't say what it was based on, and he refused to comment when
asked whether East Holmes discriminated on the basis of race.
   ``I'm not saying we violated a rule,'' Drake said Tuesday after
a meeting with a committee of the private school association. ``I'm
saying (the association) told us we violated a rule.''
   Coaches on both sides of the week-long controversy said they
hope all can be forgotten by game time.
   ``All we intend to do now is to get our football team ready to
play and to get on with the season with as few distractions as
possible,'' Heritage Academy headmaster and coach Ray Wooten said.
   Seven East Holmes players who had quit the team in protest of
the planned forfeiture of their game to Heritage have been
reinstated, school officials confirmed.
   ``The only thing I ever wanted to do was play the game,'' said
East Holmes coach Riley Myers. ``I just want my humans to block and
tackle their humans. Now that the game is back on, it's a huge
sense of relief. To me, it's the right thing to do.''
   Wooten had said earlier that East Holmes and other private
schools were considering forfeiting games against his school
because of Scott Fuller, a 15-year-old black student who
transferred to the school from West Point High School five weeks
ago.
   Sharkey-Issaquana Academy forfeited its game with Heritage last
Friday. At the time, headmaster Wayne Pinkerton said his team
wouldn't play because it was riddled with injuries and needed time
to mend.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Veto Medicaid Abortion Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, setting the stage for a nasty
confrontation with Congress, is promising to veto legislation
allowing federally financed abortions for rape and incest victims.
   ``I think wisely, that taxpayer funds should be used only in the
most narrow of circumstances, where the life of the mother is
endangered,'' Bush said Tuesday in a letter that drew criticism
from Democratic leaders in Congress and abortion rights activists.
   ``Unfortunate and regrettable,'' House Speaker Thomas Foley said
after Bush issued his veto threat. He conceded the House might
sustain the veto, but said he would make an attempt to override it.
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., a pro-choice lawmaker, said the
fallout from the battle could wind up harming GOP candidates.
   But Bush's decision was hailed by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., a
leading abortion foe in the House. He said the president had taken
a ``very principled, albeit very difficult stand,'' and added,
``Doing right isn't always popular.''
   Bush issued his veto threat several days after saying publicly
he hoped there could be flexibility on the controversial issue, and
after quiet talks designed to draft a compromise that could satisfy
pro-life lawmakers who oppose any liberalization of the current
restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion.
   ``No blame, it just didn't work out,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   At issue is a provision attached to legislation funding programs
for the Department of Health and Human Services. It would permit
Medicaid funds to be used not only for abortions to save the life
of the mother, as is now the case, but also for cases of incest and
rape.
   The legislation has passed the House on a vote of 216-206, far
less than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. It is
still awaiting Senate action.
   Bush's decision was a bow to conservatives.
   ``That ... a child may have been conceived through an
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and,
indeed, agonizing,'' Bush said. ``It does not, however, alter the
basic fact that federal funding is being sought that would compound
a violent act with the taking of a human life.''
   Bush wrote to Byrd because the West Virginia Democrat, as
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will manage the
legislation on the Senate floor.
   In the past, administration officials had suggested a veto was a
strong likelihood. Fitzwater on Tuesday ended any doubts.
   ``In the end we couldn't find any flexibility,'' Fitzwater
contended.
   Fitzwater insisted that Bush last week never intended to signal
a liberalization in his position on the issue, and was only
speaking about ``flexibility in the process.''
   The abortion provision is part of a spending bill for the
departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that has already
been approved by a House-Senate conference committee and by the
full House. It awaits final Senate approval.
   Packwood, who favors the broadening provision, said Bush's
intention to veto the measure ``hurts the Republican party; it
hurts our candidates.''
   ``It is clear that the time and tides are on the side of us on
the pro-choice side,'' he said. He told reporters that when a
Republican president vetoes such legislation, ``that becomes the
Republican party position'' in voters' eyes.
   But Fitzwater denied that current election campaigns in Virginia
and New Jersey, where public opinion polls suggest Republicans
voicing strong anti-abortion views are trailing, had been a factor
in Bush's interest in finding a compromise.
   ``No, the president said early on, `You know my position. I
don't want to change it,''' Fitzwater asserted.
   While opposing use of federal funds for abortions in cases of
incest or rape, the president has a slightly less restrictive
position when it comes to abortions that are not paid for by the
public _ and he would not ban those privately financed abortions
for pregnancies from rape or incest.

   A spate of racially charged attacks on
and near the Brown University campus has prompted the school's
president to consider asking for federal assistance to protect
students.
   In a letter to students released Tuesday, Vartan Gregorian said
racism apparently was the motivation for some of the attacks.
   ``The adminstration ... will join the local, state, and, if need
be, federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute the perpetrators
of such cowardly acts,'' Gregorian wrote.
   In a letter Monday to Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr.,
Gregorian also said he might ask for unspecified federal assistance.
   ``I believe I have a moral and legal obligation to protect the
welfare of the Brown community and I am determined to take every
measure to do so,'' he said.
   Robert Reichley, vice president of university affairs, would not
say whether Gregorian was considering asking for help from the FBI,
the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division or another federal
agency, or when he might make the request.
   Sixteen attacks with racial overtones have occurred since
classes began in September, Reichley said. In most cases, black men
have jumped white male students, punching and beating them, and
sometimes drawing guns or other weapons, Reichley said. No one has
been seriously injured, he said.
   Reichley said it was almost certain the attackers were not
students.
   The campus newspaper also has reported that black and Asian
students have been taunted by whites on campus.
   ``We have anxious parents and a student body that is clearly on
edge,'' Reichley said. ``Anything could set it off ... a larger
internal action, vigilantism, what have you.''
   Gregorian asked students ``to use good judgment and caution.
This is not a time for the bravado of vigilantism.''
   Brown has been troubled by racial episodes since last spring,
when racist and anti-homosexual epithets were scrawled in some
parts of campus, including a dormitory.
   Gregorian warned students that the latest incidents were more
serious than the ones last May. He urged students to use campus
shuttle buses, lighted walks, emergency call boxes and student-run
escort services for safety.

<HEAD>Trapped Whales Unlikely This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARROW, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's not much chance of a sequel to
last year's big event in this northern Alaskan outpost: the rescue
of three whales trapped in an ice floe.
   Conditions are warmer this fall, leaving much less ice in the
lagoon where the whales were sealed, according to the biologist who
led the international rescue effort.
   ``The situation is just totally opposite this fall,'' Geoff
Carroll said this week. ``The pack ice is way, way offshore. There
is no chance of a pressure ridge forming.''
   Last year, the pack ice had formed a pressure ridge by early
October, sealing off a shallow lagoon northeast of Barrow.
   An Eskimo hunter scouting for bowhead whales was startled to
find three young California gray whales clustered around a small
breathing hole in the rapidly thickening ice in the lagoon.
   When word of the whales' plight went out, an international
clamor arose to rescue them. Even President Reagan got involved,
authorizing the use of military planes and personnel and
telephoning encouragement to rescue officials.
   While the government, the military and the oil industry monkeyed
with a series of expensive high-technology solutions, Carroll and
local whalers set to work with chainsaws.
   By cutting a path of new breathing holes toward the open water,
they lured the whales toward freedom. One of the whales disappeared
early in the effort, but the two others followed the path with
growing enthusiasm.
   Finally, two Soviet icebreakers battered through the
30-foot-tall ridge of ice, and the whales were on their own.
   Their fate remains unknown as government scientists chose not to
attach transmitters that would have kept track of the whales'
progress. Although free of the Barrow ice, the whales faced more
than 200 miles of heavy pack ice before open water in the Chukchi
Sea.
   Unlike last fall, when Barrow was a nightly fixture on
television newscasts around the world, this autumn has slipped into
the quiet rhythm of the arctic as winter approaches.
   There is no ice on Elson Lagoon. Whalers are ranging out in
search of their favorite target, the bowhead. A 39-footer was taken
Tuesday, the sixth of the fall season.
   Although there is no horde of reporters and photographers
clamoring about town, no fleet of helicopters clattering overhead,
the whale rescue isn't forgotten.
   A small ceremony and dance were held Thursday to commemorate the
long hours of hard work by people in a community hard-pressed to
cope with the onslaught of media attention.
   Carroll, who worked as a biologist for the North Slope Borough
last year and went to work for the state last week, said there were
discussions during the winter about what to do if the trapped-whale
dilemma ever arises again.
   Carroll said no consensus was reached, but many whalers he knows
say privately they would harvest any whales trapped in the future.
Others would ignore trapped whales, leaving them on their own to
find a way out.
   ``A lot of people had a pretty good time with it last year,
although nobody wants to go through another full-scale effort that
was so expensive,'' Carroll said.
   The borough estimated it spent about $750,000 on the rescue.
Government, military and oil industry officials involved in the
operation steadfastly refused to give estimates of their expenses.
   Interest in the fate of the two freed whales remained high
during the summer as an unusually large number of gray whales
turned up dead, Carroll said. On one 40-mile stretch of beach
southwest of Barrow, nine grays washed ashore.
   One was about the size as the surviving whales and had numerous
wounds on its snout similar to those the trapped whales suffered as
they nosed up through their ice-clogged breathing holes.
   ``He was kind of cut up, but we came to the conclusion it wasn't
as bad as they (the survivors) were,'' Carroll said. ``I'm pretty
confident it wasn't the same whale.''

<HEAD>Music Store Owner To Appeal Obscenity Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDER CITY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A music store owner fined $500 for
selling a rap recording that police found sexually offensive has
accused the city of selectively enforcing its obscenity statute.
   Tommy Hammond, owner of the Taking Home the Hits music store in
this city of 14,000, said his attorney will ask a Tallapoosa County
circuit judge at a Nov. 9 hearing to throw out the conviction.
   Hammond was convicted and fined in August 1988 for selling a
cassette, 2 Live Crew's ``Move Somethin'.''
   Hammond said other stores in Alexander City are carrying the
same cassette and he believes he was singled out for what he
considers wrongful prosecution.
   ``I stepped on some toes,'' he said.
   John Dillon, an attorney who works as a prosecutor for the city,
said he was certain police would charge other store owners if the
cassette was found in their shops.
   But Hammond said his attorney had someone purchase the recording
at another store and present it to police, who took no action
against that store's owner.
   Hammond said police told him a parent complained about the sale
of the cassette, but Hammond said he was careful not to sell ``Move
Somethin''' to minors.
   Daniel Brown, another attorney for the city, said 2 Live Crew
violates the city's obscenity laws because its lyrics provide
detailed descriptions of perverse sexual acts and sadomasochism.
   Hammond's lawyer, Elizabeth Johnson of Montgomery, disagreed.
   ``Profanity and offensive music are not what obscenity is all
about,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``You may be offended by it, but that
doesn't make it obscene.''
   The group in question, 2 Live Crew, records on the Miami-based
Luke Skywalker label, which is paying half of Hammond's legal fees.
   Debbie Bennett, a publicist for the recording company, said 2
Live Crew can be raunchy, but is not obscene.
   ``It's very restricting to consider it pornography,'' she said.
``It's far, far from being that. It's humorous rap. The group
considers themselves the founders of comedic rap.''

   A Nigerian now living in Boston has pleaded guilty
to drug smuggling by swallowing 40 bags of heroin while visiting
his native land and then flying to the United States, prosecutors
said.
   Collins E. Olloh, 36, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to
importing more than 100 grams of heroin, authorities said.
   Sentencing was set for Dec. 19. He faces up to 40 years in
prison and a $2 million fine.
   When he arrived in Boston on May 24 on a flight from Nigeria, he
was detained and his luggage searched because his background and
appearance were ``consistent with a narcotics smuggler,'' according
to an affidavit signed by drug agent Felice M. Muollo Jr.
   After refusing to submit to a physical examination or X-ray, he
eventually told customs officials that he had swallowed the bags of
heroin. The bags contained about 230 grams of heroin, said a
statement from the Justice Department.

   An opean apart but linked by deep sensitivity to
earthquakes, Japanese watched with sympathy as a major temblor hit
the San Francisco area. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu offered today
to help in rescue and rebuilding efforts.
   Kaifu said he was ``deeply saddened'' by Tuesday's disaster.
   ``As we ourselves are so vulnerable to this natural disaster
that we view the fate of its victims much as that of our own ... we
are following the news from San Francisco with intense care,'' he
said in a message to President Bush.
   ``We are prepared to contribute to your efforts of emergency
rescue and reconstruction as much as we can.''
   Some Japanese, watching a live telecast of the prelude to the
World Series baseball game in Candlestick Park, saw the quake
wobble a TV camera that was showing Americans riding an escalator
into the stadium.
   ``Earthquake. Oh, oh,'' correspondent Naoki Morinaka said into
the microphone from the Candlestick Park press box. ``It's shaking
quite a lot ... almost all the lights are out ...''
   Green bars and static flashed on TV screens, showing partial
disruption of the broadcast.
   The transmission on the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) satellite
service had started at 9 a.m. Japan time, four minutes before the
quake struck.
   NHK quickly shifted the signal to its regular nationwide
network, and Japanese crowded around TV sets to see repeated scenes
from the disaster.
   Helicopter shots showed a break on the Bay Bridge, crumpled
sections of an elevated freeway, flames from a major fire in San
Francisco and baseball stars comforting their wives at the
postponed World Series game.
   Japan's volcanic islands are as seismically active as the San
Andreas Fault, and the 122 million Japanese have known repeated
disasters. The biggest this century was a Sept. 1, 1923, quake that
killed 140,000 people in Tokyo and Yokohama.
   On Saturday, a moderate quake of 5.9 on the Richter scale hit
deep under the Pacific Ocean near the coast, swaying buildings in
Tokyo and reminding the Japanese of the disaster they surely face _
big quakes are said to occur in 70-year cycles _ and for which
civil authorities are refining emergency plans.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama reported first details of the San
Francisco quake to Parliament today, and Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mayumi Moriyama told reporters the government would consider
offering emergency help if needed.
   Concern in Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines was heightened
because of the large numbers of their people living in California.
   More than 9,300 Japanese live in the San Francisco Bay area,
Mrs. Moriyama said. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs
said at least 500,000 Filipinos live in the area, one of the
largest concentrations of Filipinos in the United States.
   Hong Kong has strong links to the San Francisco area, which has
an estimated 200,000 ethnic Chinese.
   Radio stations in the Philippines interrupted regular
programming for frequent and extensive reports on the earthquake
and news organizations were flooded with calls from anxious
Filipinos with relatives in the Bay Area.
   President Corazon Aquino expressed sympathy to quake victims and
said she was directing her country's consulate in San Francisco to
``extend whatever help they can'' to Filipinos in the area.
   In Hong Kong and the Philippines, long-distance lines were
jammed by concerned people trying to call San Francisco for
information on relatives and friends.

   The former head of the embattled Washington
field office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development will retire with full benefits next month despite
allegations of mismanagement of the office, an agency spokeswoman
said.
   Under a settlement reached Monday, I. Margaret White, who had
been fighting to keep her job, will retire Nov. 3 and HUD will drop
its three-month pursuit of her termination, the spokeswoman told
The Washington Post.
   White, a 28-year employee of the agency, had faced firing for
her role in alleged improprieties in the Washington office.
   In today's editions, the newspaper quotes White as saying she
was ``ecstatic'' about the news.
   White earns $74,303 annually and her retirement benefits will be

<HEAD>Danforth Introduces Living Will Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal priest before
entering politics, has introduced legislation he says is aimed at
letting people know ``it's OK'' to plan for death just as they
think about life.
   ``We are walking along, living our lives and thinking everything
is fine,'' the Missouri Republican said at a news conference
Tuesday. ``Then suddenly, somebody you've never met before has you
hooked up to a machine you've never heard of before in an
institution you've never seen before.''
   Far better, says Danforth, is for each individual to plan for
the possibility and decide in advance whether they want to be
allowed to die with dignity when all hope of recovery is gone or be
maintained in a vegetative state by machines for weeks or months or
even years.
   The legislation he introduced Tuesday along with Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., would require the 10 states that do not already
have so-called ``living will'' laws to adopt one, although the
details would be left to the states.
   It also would require U.S. hospitals and nursing homes which
accept federal health dollars to advise their patients upon
admission of their right to executive a living will.

<HEAD>Study Says Low Wages Affect Child Care Quality</HEAD>

   A national study says low teacher pay is
threatening quality at most child care centers by driving trained
instructors away in droves.
   The study, released Tuesday, found child care teachers earn less
annually than the 1988 national poverty level for a family of
three, $9,431.
   ``Nearly half of all child care teachers leave their jobs each
year, many to seek better-paying jobs,'' according to the National
Child Care Staffing Study, titled ``Who Cares?''
   ``As the nation deliberates on what is best for its children,
the question of who will care for them grows increasingly
critical,'' said the study, which was funded by $500,000 from a
consortium of foundations, including the Ford Foundation and the
Foundation for Child Development.
   Congress is trying to work out differences in child care
legislation that has passed in the House and Senate.

<TEXT>
   Leftist Salvadoran rebels and
government negotiators broke a deadlock over truce conditions and
agreed to meet again today for peace talks aimed at ending their
country's decade-old civil war.
   The talks nearly broke off after men firing automatic weapons
killed the daughter of an army colonel in San Salvador on Tuesday.
   The Salvadoran government accused the rebels of the killing, but
guerrilla leaders emphatically denied the charge.
   Both sides later agreed to extend the two-day session another
day in response to an appeal by President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his plan to bring
peace to Central America.
   ``There are agreements. The meeting has been saved. It was
already known that this would be a critical meeting,'' said Bishop
Gregorio Rosa Chavez of El Salvador, who has been monitoring the
talks.
   ``We know the process will continue and there is more than a
mere agreement to continue meeting,'' he said, adding that both
sides pledged not to comment further until today's session ends.
   Rosa Chavez, one of several Roman Catholic leaders and
international observers monitoring the talks, spoke to reporters
during a dinner break late Tuesday.
   Both sides had appeared eager to call a cease-fire in the civil
war that has killed more than 70,000 people, but differed sharply
on the terms.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front called for a
temporary truce beginning Nov. 15 and for broad political and
social reforms. President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government
demanded an immediate cease-fire with virtually no preconditions.
   Arias intervened Tuesday night when it appeared the talks were
seriously threatened by the deadlock and the slaying Ana Isabel
Casanova. She was shot to death in her car a block from her home as
she celebrated her 23rd birthday.
   Arias rushed to the parish house in the little town of Moravia
just north of the capital, where the talks are being held.
   ``I came to encourage both sides to continue,'' he told
reporters. ``I know that after 10 years of war, it is difficult to
attain peace, which is a slow and complicated process.''
   Arias invited the two delegations to dinner after they promised
to continue talking today.
   The talks are the second meeting between the rebels and the
Cristiani government, which took office in June. An opening session
was held in Mexico City in September.
   A previous round of negotiations between the government and
rebels, in October 1987, broke off because of the assassination of
Herbert Anaya, the leader of a leftist human rights group.

<HEAD>Teachers Identify With Author Tracy Kidder's Classroom Chronicle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators and their supporters at the Statehouse
turned out to honor Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder, who
chronicled a year in the life of a Massachusetts teacher in his
latest, highly acclaimed book.
   ``Among Schoolchildren,'' the chronicle of Kidder's year with
Holyoke schoolteacher Chris Zajac's fifth-grade class, has left a
lot of people nodding in reluctant recognition.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis says it's among the best four or five
books he's ever read and public schoolteachers are using it as a
rallying cry.
   About 200 education activists showed up at a Statehouse
reception Tuesday for Kidder, the author of ``The Soul of a New
Machine'' and ``House,'' and hear him read excerpts from his latest
effort.
   ``Everyone who has read (the book) agrees: It tells it like it
is,'' said Phyllis Smith, a former teacher and now an administrator
at Marblehead's public schools. ``No honey-faced lies and a lot you
can identify with.''
   In the book, Kidder doesn't gloss over low pay, lack of respect
and poor working conditions teachers face. He demonstrates little
patience with high-minded reform efforts that he says ``seem to
leave teachers right out of the equation.''
   The story has had particular resonance in Massachusetts this
fall because of the state's fiscal crisis and the resulting
financial problems of many public schools.
   In Holyoke, for instance, students don't have physical
education, art or music courses this year because the funds aren't
available and residents aren't willing to approve a tax increase,
Kidder said.
   ``I constantly am questioning why I'm doing something and
reflecting on my weaknesses,'' said Zajac, who was 34 years old
when Kidder persuaded her to let him join her class three years ago.
   ``I am not a saint or a miracle worker or even a witch doctor,''
she told her colleagues Tuesday afternoon. ``I'm a public school
teacher from Holyoke, just one of millions.''
   ``It's important for us to be as concerned with what something
is worth as with what it costs,'' said Rep. Nicholas A. Paleologos,
chairman of the House Committee on Education, Arts and Humanities
and sponsor of a petition introduced Tuesday to add a penny for
education to the 5 percent sales tax.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Clear Way for State to Implement Notification Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Georgia officials have asked a federal appeals
court to let them enforce a law requiring young women to inform
their parents before having an abortion.
   But a lawyer representing Planned Parenthood urged the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday to uphold lower court decisions
that for two years have blocked enforcement of the law.
   The law would require young women under age 18 to bring a note
from a parent before having an abortion or otherwise show the
parents had been notified. It includes a provision under which a
minor could secure the permission of a juvenile court judge to
undergo an abortion without parental knowledge.
   The law mandates a 24-hour wait between parental notification
and an abortion.
   The statute was passed in 1987, but a challenge by Planned
Parenthood resulted in key portions being ruled unconstitutional
before it took effect.
   The Legislature revised the statute in 1988 with the same result.
   Among other things, U.S. District Judge Robert Hall cited the
statute's failure to provide for swifter forms of written notice
and held that it improperly allowed a juvenile court ``intake
officer'' to screen and possibly dismiss a young woman's request
for a waiver.
   Kathryn Allen, a senior assistant state attorney general,
complained to the three appeals court judges that Hall applied too
strict a standard.
   She argued that the state ``is not required to meet every
contingency as long as the statute is narrowly drawn.''
   If anything can be learned from the U.S. Supreme Court's
abortion decision last summer, Ms. Allen added, ``it is that state
statutes will be given the benefit of the doubt and the court will
attempt to read it in a manner that will make it constitutional.''
   But Dara Klassel, an attorney representing Planned Parenthood
chapters in Atlanta and Augusta, argued that the Supreme Court
decision did nothing to change the standard of review.
   Laws affecting ``a fundamental constitutional right have to be
subjected to strict scrutiny,'' she said.
   The court took the appeal under consideration without indicating
when it would rule.

   Rows of police officers flanked a coffin draped
in white to mourn a young recruit who shot himself to death after
he fell short of his lifelong goal of becoming a policeman.
   Danny Morales was not depressed and was not the type to plan his
death, the Rev. Robert Stiefvater told about 250 mourners who
packed a Roman Catholic church Tuesday.
   When his dream of becoming a police officer began slipping, the
21-year-old Morales took his revolver and shot himself in the head
Friday in front of his instructor at the Police Training Academy
shooting range.
   ``We cannot condone what he did,'' Stiefvater said. ``We cannot
condemn him for what he did. What he did is a part of us.''
   Stiefvater said all of Milwaukee, where homicides and
drug-related crimes have risen to record levels this year, is
hurting ``in this autumn of a hundred violent deaths.''
   ``There is something missing in the way we support each other
that allows these things to happen,'' he said. ``But we can turn
things around and we can start right now.''
   Turning to Morales' uniformed academy classmates who were seated
in pews at the side of the altar, Stiefvater said, ``The Lord tells
us to live our values the way you wear that patch ... so that all
can see it.''
   Stiefvater's church is across the street from Milwaukee
Technical High School, where Morales launched the second generation
of his family's tradition of winning high school wrestling
championships. Morales helped coach sports teams at the parish.
   He was remembered as a promising young man whose suicide stunned
family and friends.
   Inspector Joseph Kalivoda, commander of the Police Department's
training bureau, recalled Morales' role within the current training
class and how he would be remembered.
   ``Every recruit class has a different personality. A few days
after they started, an instructor noted this class was very
team-oriented,'' Kalivoda said.
   ``Danny was taken from us because of the will of the Lord. Some
day we will understand why. When his class graduates January fifth,
I believe his spirit will be with them.''
   Morales was accepted to the recruit class that started training
Aug. 20. A month later, he failed a firing range test and then
failed the retest and resigned from the academy Sept. 29.
   After finding out he was nearsighted, Morales got glasses and
appealed his resignation. He was allowed another chance to take the
shooting test.
   On Friday, after a week of remedial training and full of renewed
hope, he returned to the range to retake the test. But it quickly
became clear the glasses weren't the only problem with his
marksmanship.
   Morales needed a score of 210 of 300 in three rounds of shooting.
   He scored a poor 62 in the first round, and 66 in the second. He
needed an 82 in the third round, and it was clear he couldn't get
it. He used the remaining shot to kill himself.

<HEAD>Ozal Seeks Job That Will Move Him Out of Active Politics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal has announced he will
run for president, a post that would remove him from day-to-day
politics and could lead to a fight for leadership of his governing
Motherland Party.
   The presidency is a prestigious post but is mainly ceremonial
with few executive powers. Also, the president cannot belong to a
political party.
   Ozal announced his intentions Tuesday to the parlimentary
deputies of his party, whose members include Moslem fundamentalists
and pro-Western moderates pushing for Turkey's membership in the
European Economic Community.
   ``Time will come when we will have to part, if for no other
reason then when Allah calls us to his bosom,'' Ozal said to the
deputies, who gave him a standing ovation. ``This way it will be
easier. There will be change.''
   Analysts say Ozal, 62, who had a triple heart bypass operation
three years ago, wants the less strenous job of president for
health and political reasons.
   Parliament will begin voting Friday to elect a successor to
President Kenan Evren, whose seven-year term expires Nov. 9.
   The Motherland Party has a 289-seat majority in the 450-member
legislature.
   The opposition parties came out strongly against Ozal's
candidacy but so far they have not offered a candidate of their
own. Erdal Inonu, leader of the chief opposition Social Democrat
Populist Party, said Tuesday that party members would boycott
Parliament sessions during presidential balloting.
   The opposition says an Ozal presidency would be against the
spirit of the constitution because he lacks sufficient public
support and could never be the non-partisan president required by
the constitution.
   Under Turkey's constitution, general elections must be held if
Parliament fails to elect a president by the fourth and final
ballot, which is scheduled for Nov. 4.
   A two-thirds majority is necessary on the first two ballots and
political analysts say Ozal is likely to be elected Oct. 31 on a
third ballot, when a simple majority is sufficient.
   Ozal said party members have indicated they will allow him to
designate his successor as party leader and premier. But some
analysts say the party could be divided over the choice and that a
government crisis could follow.
   Some names mentioned as possible candidates for premier are
Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Finance Minister Ekrem Pakdemirli
and former Education Minister Hasan Celal Guzel.
   Ozal became premier six years ago when the newly formed
Motherland Party won elections that restored civilian rule. A
military junta had taken over in 1980 at a time of widespread
political terrorism and an economic crisis.
   During military rule, Ozal served as deputy premier in charge of
the economy and implemented economic liberalization measures that
since have quadrupled Turkey's exports.
   There also has been a massive investment in roads, power plants
and telecommunications during Ozal's leadership.
   But the price has been high inflation, which has run at 75
percent for the past two years.
   Public support for Ozal and his party has been sliding. In
recent polls published by Turkish papers, at least 60 percent of
the respondents opposed an Ozal presidency. In local elections in
March, the Motherland Party won only 21.75 percent of the vote.

<HEAD>Earthquake Puts World Series in Perspective for Ballplayers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The earth shook for 20 seconds, and when it
stopped the big-league ballplayers weren't talking about their
championship anymore.
   Frightened Giants and Athletics dashed out of their dugouts,
while in the stands their stunned fans watched the concrete
overhang ripple ominously as Tuesday's earthquake struck and forced
cancellation of the third game of the World Series at Candlestick
Park.
   ``It makes you realize just what place baseball should have in
your life,'' said San Francisco Giants catcher Terry Kennedy. ``I
found that out tonight.''
   ``You can't stop concrete,'' Oakland outfielder Dave Henderson
said. ``Forget the World Series.''
   Fans in the sellout crowd of about 60,000 remained calm when the
tremors struck. Several people were hit by small chunks of metal
and concrete before Candlestick was calmly evacuated. No serious
injuries were reported at the stadium.
   As of early today there was no word on when the series might
resume.
   ``We needed to get everybody out of here before it gets dark,''
baseball commissioner Fay Vincent said. ``That was the governing
issue in the decision to postpone the game.''
   Game No. 3 of the championship series between the San Francisco
Bay area teams had been scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m. The quake
struck at 5:04 p.m.
   Viewers of ABC's World Series pregame show saw the picture turn
to static and heard an unidentified voice yell, ``We're having an
earth...'' before the transmission was lost.
   The picture then disappeared and the network put up a still
slide for the World Series, before switching to the program
``Roseanne.''
   ``It could have been a catastrophe,'' said Will Clark, the San
Francisco Giants star first baseman. ``We had one in L.A. last
year, but this was more scary because we have a packed house here.''
   Security guard Mark Dandridge, 26, said he saw a stadium light
tower sway, ``and then I looked down to the luxury boxes and I saw
all that starting to shake, and I said `Oh, God help us!' ''
   Said Oakland slugger Jose Canseco, ``I didn't know where I was
for five seconds.''
   ``It was a steady sort of shake and roll and it was an extremely
uneasy moment,'' said Al Michaels, ABC-TV's announcer, who was in
the Candlestick press box when the quake hit. ``The sense I got for
a split second was we were going backward.''
   Umpire Al Clark was still in the dressing room.
   ``It was one of the scariest situations I've ever been in. As
soon as it started, my legs went numb,'' he said. ``I looked up,
and the walls were waving. I became frightened, and I realized it
was an earthquake.''
   ``I knew something was wrong when I saw the first base dugout
moving,'' said Kennedy. ``My first thought was to look for my wife
in the stands. I spotted her and rushed over.''
   Carl Epolite of San Jose decided to leave as soon as he felt the
first aftershock, about 35 minutes after the quake. He was sitting
in the upper deck under a concrete overhang.
   ``We saw the overhang starting to ripple,'' Carl said. ``It
rippled all around the stadium, but we kind of took it in stride,
and people started cheering. Some people took it as a good sign for
the Giants, that it was a sign from God that the Giants would start
winning.''

   Thousands of stranded office workers
mingled with homeless people in downtown streets as a pitch black
night fell over the blacked out, earthquake-damaged city.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through profound darkness as the sky turned indigo and a few stars
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire in the northern Marina
district early today.
   The occasional office building or hotel running on emergency
generators stood out in the blackness. Electrically powered
trolleys formed little empty holes of light where they stalled,
emergency blinkers winking in and out.
   Car headlights criss-crossed and pedestrians dodged among them.
   Elderly residents of the Fox Plaza office building's penthouses
sat in complete darkness in the mezzanine, listening to the radio.
   ``We're in charge. It's under control. The citizens have
responded nobly,'' said Mayor Art Agnos. ``I think we were very
organized and we were very lucky. We were well prepared.''
   Thousands of downtown office workers were left with no major
transportation routes to homes across the water in areas of the
East Bay.
   Part of the top deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
collapsed onto the lower road. The BART commuter train was shut
down.
   After a two-hour bus ride bypassing the closed bridges over the
bay, writer Michael Mercer arrived at his Oakland home with ``just
enough moonlight to see that my apartment has been trashed by the
quake.
   ``I was going to rearrange things anyway,'' he said.
   Others stayed in San Francisco, strolling around, helping to
direct traffic or meeting friends in bars. Little looting or
vandalism was reported. People sat outside dingy hotels, on the
stoops of apartment houses, on curbs.
   An eerie, pale orange moon rose over the city.
   Among the buildings that remained lit were San Francisco General
Hospital and the elegant new Davies Symphony Hall, a glass and
brass structure with bright, full-length windows.
   The Marina district, where a huge fire consumed a block of
buildings, was without power. Emergency vehicles covered a
10-square-block area. Streets buckled everywhere and the smell of
natural gas permeated the air.
   A three-story apartment building collapsed. Its top story was
left intact _ its windows looking out at street level.
   Loretta Mild, a resident of San Francisco for 14 years, urged a
policeman to go inside the collapsed building to look for survivors.
   Officer Kris Kvale said he had been inside what was left of the
building, found nobody but conceded ``there's no way to get down
there'' below the rubble.
   Daddy Paul's, a Chestnut Street bar, remained open after the
quake, doing brisk business by candlelight, though it was not a
boisterous scene.
   ``We just stopped in here to get out of the earthquake,'' said
Bob Levine, who was aboard his boat when the quake hit.
   ``It jumped out of the water a little at first and then twice.''
   Levine said he helped fire fighters carry hoses and carry a burn
victim out of the big apartment fire, then helped shut off four
public gas mains before ending up at the bar to meet friends.
   Red Cross officials set up a relief center at the Marina middle
school, bringing in supplies and cots as several hundred people
crowded at the entrance to get in.
   Elsewhere, two Cambodian families set up a makeshift camp on a
park lawn after massive cracks opened in the walls of their old
apartment building.
   Chhoeut Sun, 12, said his family could not go back home, had no
food and would remain in the camp.

   Bill Cosby told an audience of children
how they could return the favor of his showing up at their school:
``Study and become somebody.''
   ``Remember what I did tonight for you,'' Cosby told about 50
Carver Elementary Academy second-graders Monday. ``You're looking
at a grown-up who could be home with his wife, sitting there
watching `Monday Night Football.'''
   Cosby performed in a benefit show that brought in $175,000 for
the school, which opened this fall in an predominantly minority
neighborhood and stresses the use of computers to help youngsters
learn.
   Cosby had been enlisted to help by oilman T. Boone Pickens,
whose company Mesa Limited Partnership last March contributed more
than $400,000 to the school district and agreed to seek other
donors. The district, struggling with a $7.3 million budget
shortfall, had considered postponing the school's opening.
   Cosby said he believes private financing of public education
will become more common.
   ``I gave this up to come here and save your school,'' Cosby told
the pupils in mock seriousness. ``At least you could study and
become something. I didn't come out here so that you guys could
become nothing.''

<TEXT>
   Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San
Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would
strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.
   But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it
also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a
reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale
rocked the Bay area.
   A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a
6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San
Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward
through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.
   The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in
the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S.
Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet
whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.
   The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa
Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
   The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor
Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting
estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally
happened Tuesday.
   These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress
inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake
of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least
2,500 people.
   The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the
longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again.
   Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as
much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists
believed. That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San
Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.
   Others disagreed. Faced with conflicting estimates, the
Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said
represented a consensus on the debate.
   The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood
of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years. It said the
southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of
generating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.
   Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles
of the fault segment.
   ``Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a
particularly hazardous one,'' Heaton said. ``There was some debate
about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.''
   The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very
few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.
   Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall
victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast
doubt on this assumption.
   Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big
one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill
3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000
people in the Bay Area.
   As bad as Tuesday's quake was, ``it was not a 1906 earthquake,''
Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.
   ``The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming. The
question is when,'' Peck said.

<HEAD>Father and Son Ordered to Face Charges in World's Biggest Cocaine
Bust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father and son accused of helping run the
smuggling ring cracked in the world's largest cocaine seizure were
ordered Tuesday to return to Los Angeles and face charges in
federal court.
   U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt ruled there was a ``clear
showing'' of probable cause that Carlos Tapia Ponce and his son,
Hector Tapia Anchondo, were involved in the drug ring that led to
the warehouse seizure last month of 19 tons of cocaine.
   Leavitt's ruling came after an hour-long preliminary hearing
during which prosecutors presented a Drug Enforcement
Administration agent as the only witness against the two men.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, and Tapia Anchondo, 38, both Mexicans, have
been jailed without bail since their arrest at a Las Vegas hotel
Sept. 29, the day the cocaine and $12.2 million in cash was found
in the Sylmar warehouse.
   DEA agent William Sherman, who participated in the surveillance
of the warehouse, testified during the hearing that James McTague,
one of four men arrested in Los Angeles, identified the father and
son as the leaders of the massive cocaine distribution operation.
   ``He claimed to have been hired by Carlos Tapia Ponce and Hector
Tapia Anchondo to run the warehouse and supervise the distribution
of the cocaine,'' Sherman said.
   Sherman said another suspect arrested in Los Angeles, Gilbert
Mendoza, claimed he was hired by the son to drive a tractor-trailer
on cocaine runs from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles.
   Defense attorney David Chesnoff, making an unsuccessful attempt
to get the charges dropped, claimed both men have recanted their
statements and will not testify against the Tapias in their federal
court trial.
   Prosecutor Tom Green, however, said the government only needed
to establish ``bare bones'' probable cause in the hearing and had
met its burden of proof.
   Tapia Ponce and Tapia Anchondo were arrested the day the bust
was made in Los Angeles while vacationing with their families at a
Las Vegas hotel.
   In an affidavit filed in the case, a DEA agent said McTague,
married to Tapia Anchondo's sister, said he had been in charge of
the warehouse for about a year and during that time 60 tons of
cocaine had moved through the facility.
   Authorities estimated the street value of the seized cocaine at
from $2 billion to $20 billion.

<HEAD>Government Official Willing to Talk With Freed ANC Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet minister assigned
to promote negotiations with black leaders says he's prepared to
meet with freed African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu
about the ANC's possible role in talks.
   ``If we want to get going, the fewer preconditions the better,''
Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen said Tuesday.
   He said the the outlawed guerrilla movement would have to
demonstrate that it was committed to peaceful negotiations to
participate in talks between blacks and the government about
white-black power-sharing.
   But Viljoen indicated that it would not necessarily have to
formally renounce violence, as previously demanded by the white
minority government.
   Despite the apparent concession to guerrilla movement, an ANC
official in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the 49-nation Commonwealth
summit called for more sanctions against South Africa's government.
   ANC foreign affairs spokesman Thabo Mbeki also said: ``It is
very important ... to pay attention to the question of building up
the military capacity to conduct a sustained armed struggle _ not
merely to carry out an operation once in a while, however
spectacular.
   ``It is more important than a bomb going off here and there,''
he said.
   Mbeki called on the Commonwealth, an association of Britain and
its former colonies, to impose tougher sanctions Africa despite the
release Sunday of Sisulu and seven other longtime political
prisoners and promises of reform by President F.W. de Klerk.
   However, the Rev. Allan Boesak, a founder of South Africa's
anti-apartheid United Democratic Front, said he supported the idea
of a six-month moratorium on further sanctions.
   Boesak, also in Malaysia, said the deadline should be for the
repeal of all discriminatory laws when Parliament convenes early
next year. The laws range from regulations segregating residential
areas to denying the vote to the black majority.
   The Commonwealth's stand on South Africa was a main issue at the
summit, which opened today.
   Sisulu, six other African National Congress leaders and a member
of a smaller black nationalist movement were freed unconditionally
Sunday after lengthy prison terms.
   The ANC leaders said they still supported the principle of
violent resistance, but added that they would encourage ``orderly
and disciplined'' anti-government pressure.
   ``It's not because (the ANC) believes in violence for its own
sake. It is because of compelling conditions. Remove the compelling
conditions and there will be peace,'' Sisulu said Tuesday in
Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
   Sisulu, 77, is the highest-ranking of the freed activists and
spent 26 years in prison along with his close friend, senior ANC
leader Nelson Mandela.
   Sisulu said the ANC would be prepared to enter negotiations if
the government legalizes all banned political organizations, lifts
the 3-year-old state of emergency and releases all political
prisoners.
   De Klerk has said he is reviewing these matters to see what
steps he might be able to take, and Viljoen expressed willingness
to meet with Sisulu to discuss the demands.

   The government appeared ready today to allow the
release of at least three people convicted of 1974 Irish terrorist
bombings and news reports said police investigators involved in the
cases would be prosecuted.
   The Home Office, responsible for law enforcement, announced
Tuesday that it would not oppose an appeal by the so-called
Guildford Four, who were imprisoned 14 years ago for the two fatal
IRA bombings that targeted British soldiers.
   The three man and a woman have maintained their innocence since
being convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. News
reports said at least three probably would be released soon after a
Court of Appeal hearing Thursday.
   The government refused to comment on reports that police
involved in the investigation of the case would face prosecution.
   The Times of London reported today without attribution: ``A
handful of officers, who were then of relatively junior rank, will
face charges after an investigation by ... police into a number of
aspects of the original inquiry.''
   The Independent quoted unidentified parliamentary sources as
saying two or three police officers were expected to face criminal
proceedings for alleged corruption.
   A third newspaper, The Guardian, said the government's former
director of public prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn, withheld
crucial alibi evidence from defense lawyers at the 1975 trial.
   In January, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed to a review by an
appeals court following mounting pressure from the Irish
government, church leaders, former Cabinet ministers and senior
judges.
   ``Circumstances have recently come to the notice of the Director
of Public Prosecutions (Allan Green) which have caused him to
conclude that it would be wrong for the Crown to seek to sustain
the convictions,'' said a statement issued by Green's office on
Tuesday.
   Paul Hill, Gerard Conlon and Patrick Armstrong, all of Belfast,
and Armstrong's English girlfriend, Carole Richardson, were
convicted of bombing two pubs in Guildford, southwest of London, in
Oct. 5, 1974. Five people, including two soldiers, were killed and
65 injured.
   Armstrong and Hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974, in which two people died
and 26 were injured.
   Hill is serving a concurrent sentence for the murder of a former
British soldier in Belfast. That conviction, also in 1975, was
based on statements obtained by Belfast police while he was in
prison in Guildford.
   His lawyer, Michael Fisher, said he hoped the Home Office ``will
have the decency to release him from the Belfast conviction.''
   The Guardian, quoting unidentified Home Office sources,
reported: ``There is written evidence that a conscious decision was
taken ... to withhold alibi witness statements'' from Conlon's
lawyers.
   In ordering the case reviewed, Hurd had cited possible alibi
witnesses for two of the convicts, and evidence that Ms. Richardson
had been injected with drugs during interrogation because she was
suffering from withdrawal from barbiturates.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
issued a statement today welcoming the government's announcement.
   ``Amnesty International said it had for years been concerned
about the ... Guildford convictions, which were based solely on
confessions allegedly obtained through coercion and had repeatedly
called on the government to review the case,'' the statement said.
   All four were convicted on the basis of incriminating statements
they repudiated at trial.
   Four members of an Irish Republican Army unit confessed to the
Guildford pub bombings after their arrest in December 1975, but
they were never charged. In Dublin, the Irish government welcomed
the decision ``in the most positive terms.'' Cardinal Basil Hume,
head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, told
British Broadcasting Corp. television he was ``immensely grateful''
for the decision.
   But Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's
legal political wing, told 500 supporters at Hackney in east London
Tuesday night: ``We don't thank the British government. They've
only done what they should have done 14 years ago.''
   The almost exclusively Catholic IRA is fighting to push the
British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and join it
with the Republic of Ireland.

   A bomb exploded aboard a bus in
Pakistan's eastern Punjab province today, killing eight people and
wounding 30, police said.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bus was
traveling north between the towns of Wazirabad and Gujrat, about
100 miles southeast of the capital of Islamabad, when the explosion
occurred.
   Police said a bomb was the cause, but they had no immediate

   California Gov. George Deukmejian
said today he was ``very surprised'' by the extent of highway
damage caused by the devastating earthquake in his state and
promised a probe into why roads failed.
   Deukmejian said he had not spoken with President Bush, but that
state officials would ask Bush to declare a federal emergency for
the stricken area in and around San Francisco.
   California has a ``prudent reserve'' of $1 billion that ``we can
use and that we will use'' to help recover from Tuesday's temblor.
   Deukmejian, during a hastily called news conference at a
Frankfurt hotel, also warned of the possibility of gas line
explosions and said he had heard of ``very minor incidents'' of
looting.
   The governor, looking somber and tired, later broke off his
trade mission to West Germany and rushed back to California to
supervise rescue and reconstruction efforts.
   Jim Robinson, the governor's spokesman, said that Deukmejian had
left Frankfurt on a flight that originally was to arrive at San
Francisco airport. Robinson said that the airplane would be
diverted, most likely to Los Angeles, if it is not possible to land
in San Francisco due to the earthquake.
   He told The Associated Press that wherever Deukmejian lands, he
would immediately board a waiting U.S. military aircraft and be
taken for an inspection of the damaged areas.
   ``We will have to have the maximum use of equipment, the
necessary kind of equipment to assist in the rescue and the
restoration, and, of course, personnel,'' said Deukmejian.
   ``To the extent the federal government can make that available
either through the military or the Corp of Engineers or other
agencies, all that will be welcomed and, I'm sure, will be needed.''
   The governor said the number of ``confirmed'' deaths was
approximately 70 people.
   However, the state Office of Emergency Services said at least
200 people were crushed to death in their cars when a
half-mile-long section of the upper level of Interstate 880 in
Oakland collapsed onto the lower level. Other deaths also were
reported.
   In addition, a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge's
top deck collapsed onto the lower deck and police said at least two
bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed.
   ``I had been under the impression that the highways had been
constructed to deal with any severe earthquake,'' Deukmejian told
reporters. ``And I am very surprised to see what has happened with
some of those.''
   ``I think that we are going to have to have some inquiry with
respect to that, to determine why they did not withstand a quake of
the severity of this one,'' he said.
   Deukmejian said the state was primarily responsible for ensuring
that California's highways can withstand quake damage.
   He declined to comment on damage to buildings, saying he did not
have details about which ones were affected or when they were built.
   ``There is, of course, massive destruction,'' he said. ``And
we're not going to know for a long time yet what the full extent of
it is.''
   The governor said utility companies were working ``vigorously''
to restore electricity to stricken areas.
   He said emergency teams also ``anticipate there will be gas
explosions and the like.''
   He noted that various emergency agencies had planned and
practiced for the possibility of such a disaster: ``The medical
facilities seem to be working quite well.''
   Deukmejian said the National Guard was involved in emergency
efforts, but denied what he called television reports that the
guard had been brought in specially to assist in ``quelling
rioting.''
   Jim Robinson, Deukmejian's chief of public affairs, said the
governor would leave Frankfurt later in the morning on a non-stop
Lufthansa flight for California. Robinson said that Deukmejian
would arrive in Los Angeles, if it were impossible to land in San
Francisco.

   Hundreds of airline passengers were stranded today after flights
to the San Francisco area were diverted or canceled because of the
earthquake.
   The delays and cancellations affected travelers as far away as
Japan, which has direct air service to San Francisco, and some
passengers landed far from their destinations.
   The quake stranded more than 800 travelers at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago, where crowds huddled around TV
sets Tuesday night watching news reports about the quake.
   ``Most of the ones who were trying to get back to their families
were pretty distressed,'' said Racquel O'Bryant, spokeswoman at the
Holiday Inn O'Hare, where more than 100 stranded travelers stayed.
``A lot of people were calling for their families, but there was
just no way to get through. The phone lines were open only for
emergencies.''
   San Francisco International Airport and Oakland Airport remained
closed early today. San Jose International Airport was open with
only minor damage, officials said.
   United Airlines had at least 30 flights canceled or diverted
because of the earthquake as of Tuesday night, said spokesman Joe
Hopkins in Chicago. He said San Francisco is a major hub for
United, with about 140 arrivals and 140 departures every day.
   Al Becker, a Chicago-based spokesman for American Airlines, said
several hundred of the airline's flights had been affected by the
disaster.
   Five United and American flights bound for the San Francisco
area were diverted to Salt Lake City, said Tom Hill, airport
authority supervisor in Salt Lake.
   Five Delta Air Lines flights were ended prematurely in Salt Lake
City, and one was canceled, said Fred Rollins, Delta district
marketing director.

<HEAD>Aftershocks A Danger in Quake</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with updated information on aftershocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

   Hundreds of small earthquake aftershocks were
continuing along the San Andreas fault where Tuesday's tremor
struck Northern California, government scientists said today.
   ``We are looking for any unusual characteristics and will be
putting out more portable instruments to measure the aftershocks,''
said Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist for the U.S. Geological
Survey.
   ``An earthquake of this size will typically by followed by many
thousands of aftershocks in the weeks to come,'' a USGS statement
said. California still faces the danger of large tremors as well,
said Russ.
   ``This certainly was not the `Big One,''' he said, referring to
a major quake that has long been feared for California. The
anticipated big quake would be expected to read at 8.0 or more on
the Richter scale, while Tuesday's quake is being estimated at 6.9.
   The temblor was centered between Los Gatos and San Juan
Bautista, an area south of San Francisco where scientists said in a
report last year was among three regions where dangerous tremors
were likely.
   A serious shock of magnitude 7.0 or more is still a possibility
along the nearby Hayward Fault, Russ said. And, he said, the
continuing chance of a quake of magnitude 8.0 or more in Southern
California ``has us very worried.''
   Russ explained that when an earthquake occurs, it releases
stress in the ground. That action, however, can increase the stress
in nearby areas, resulting in many aftershocks that follow major
earthquakes.
   Earthquakes result from the movements of plates deep within the
earth, Russ said. These plates can move fairly easily at depths of
six miles or more because the heat and pressure cause the rocks to
become like plastic so they can slip past one another.
   Closer to the earth's surface, however, the rocks are more rigid
and stick together, causing strain to build up until it is released
in an earthquake.
   In California, the boundary between the Pacific plate that
underlies that ocean and the North American plate forms a series of
faults running north and south through the state. these plates move
in different directions at a rate of about two centimeters, which
is nearly an inch a year.
   The major and best known fault is the San Andreas, which
consists of a series of segments that Russ said do not all move
together. Thus, there can be an earthquake in one area without
necessarily causing a tremor in another part of the fault.
   The region where Tuesday's quake was centered had been
relatively quiet in recent years until 1988. A strong quake, rated
at 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred in June 1988 and a second
rated 5.2 occurred in August of this year.
   Such quakes can indicate that a larger one will follow, Russ
said.
   Scientists had rated the probability of a severe quake in this
region at about 30 percent, he said.
   By comparison, the geologist said, some studies have indicated a
60 percent chance of a severe quake in the Los Angeles region some
time in the next 30 years.

<HEAD>Thatcher Argues Against Sanctions, New Secretary-General Elected</HEAD>

   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher told a summit meeting of the 49-nation Commonwealth today
that imposing sanctions on South Africa would be ``utterly
irresponsible,'' her aides said.
   Mrs. Thatcher said South African President F.W. de Klerk had
made a ``major step forward'' by releasing eight black nationalist
leaders, allowing peaceful demonstrations and being willing to
``consult all shades of opinion.''
   ``We are most likely to achieve our aim by giving encouragement,
not by trying to behave as if nothing significant had happened,''
an aide, who asked not to be identified, quoted her as saying.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the sole opponent in the Commonwealth of
sanctions against South Africa, spoke during a closed session soon
shortly after the weeklong biennial summit opened.
   Her aide said the prime minister ``thought sanctions at this
stage would be utterly irresponsible.''
   Gongs, cymbals and Malaysian dancers greeted the leaders of the
association of Britain and its former colonies as they filed into
Kuala Lumpur's Putra World Trade Center.
   In another development, the Commonwealth leaders elected Chief
Emeka Anyaoku of Nigeria as the new secretary-general over former
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Malayasian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the summit host, refused to disclose the voting
breakdown after what had been a closely fought contest.
   Anyaoku, 56, has been deputy secretary-general at the
Commonwealth Secretariat in London since 1975. He will replace
Guyuanan Sir Shridath Ramphal, whose third five-year term expires
next June.
   Earlier, in opening speeches before the summit went into closed
session, Mahathir called for stronger sanctions against South
Africa, while Canada's Prime Minister Mulroney urged the
maintenance of existing measures.
   The opening speeches reflected differences on whether to press
for tougher sanctions against South Africa now, or give de Klerk
six months to implement promised reforms.
   British officials said Mrs. Thatcher will oppose any move to set
a six-month deadline as well as any tougher measures.
   Debates on the deterioration of the global environment and
international drug trafficking were also scheduled to dominate the
informal agenda. Mahathir, in a speech, blamed developed countries
for the world's environmental problems on the developing countries.
   Pakistan returned to the Commonwealth this month after a 17-year
absence, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto headed the delegation.
   The leaders will spend the weekend in retreat at Langkawi Island
off West Malaysia.

<HEAD>Baby Sitter Wins Temporary Custody Of 12-Year-Old Girl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who claims her 12-year-old daughter was
kidnapped as an infant and a baby sitter who says the mother gave
the child to her because she couldn't care for her are locked in a
legal battle over the seventh-grader.
   Juvenile Court Judge Orrelle Weeks ruled Tuesday that temporary
custody of the girl be given to Maxine McCaslin, 43, who has raised
the child since she was 6 months old. A hearing on permanent
custody was not immediately scheduled.
   Until Friday, the girl was unaware that McCaslin was not her
biological mother. That day, Cynthia Anderson, 31, was in a
supermarket when she heard the voice of McCaslin, who used to work
for her as a baby sitter. Anderson had not seen McCaslin since
1977, when she said the sitter and Anderson's daughter vanished.
   Anderson got McCaslin's license number and notified police.
Detective Mona Jaramillo said the women had lived just 17 blocks
apart for the last two years.
   ``It's a very sticky situation,'' said police Sgt. Gordon Reed.
``There's always two sides to every story.''
   Anderson, has charged that police mishandled the case and failed
to investigate abduction charges she filed at the time of the
disappearance.
   ``I will fight this. I will,'' Anderson said. ``They can believe
it. And if they think they're going to wear me out, they can think
again.''
   Police said Tuesday that Anderson did not report her child
missing until six weeks after McCaslin allegedly disappeared with
her daughter. The report she filed was for a violation of custody,
not kidnapping, officials said.
   McCaslin told police that Anderson asked her to care for the
child because Anderson could not.
   ``It was hell keeping the secret,'' police quoted McCaslin as
saying. She had an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment.
   All supplemental reports and investigative reports, if there was
an investigation, have been destroyed, police said. They are forced
to rely on officers' memories.
   The Rocky Mountain News quoted sources close to the
investigation who said that at the time her child disappeared,
Anderson was working as a dancer at a strip joint or as an employee
in a nearby adult arcade.
   When she said her baby sitter had taken her child, ``the officer
thought I was overreacting,'' Anderson said Tuesday. ``He said I
couldn't just accuse someone of a felony.
   ``He said I had to wait a legal amount of time and file a
missing person report. I went back and signed a piece of paper that
said she was kidnapped. They said they put out an arrest warrant.''
   Denver police never put out a warrant. They filed the case as a
custody dispute.
   McCaslin told the girl of her history after both were taken to
police headquarters Friday night, police said. No charges were
filed.
   ``We are not sure whether we will file criminal charges against
McCaslin at this point,'' said Capt. Jim Fitzpatrick. ``The main
person we and the courts are concerned about at this point is the
victim.''
   Police said the girl had been well treated and was raised in an
excellent environment. Neighbors and school officials said the girl
is a well-adjusted seventh-grader, a B-plus student and a
volleyball player at a private school.
   Jaramillo said police were unable to comment on McCaslin's
whereabouts until two years ago because it is part of the
investigation. There also was no information immediately available
about the girl's father.
   Anderson's lawyer, Dennis Blewitt, said his client was an unwed
mother who ``was kicked out of her home'' as a teen-ager. Although
she is unemployed and not married, she received an insurance
settlement after an accident and is financially capable of caring
for her daughter, he said.
   Blewitt said the city Department of Social Services, which took
custody of the child over the weekend, refused to let his client
see her daughter Tuesday.

   Aftershocks continued today as rescuers
struggled to free motorists from an elevated highway collapsed by
an earthquake that jarred Northern California, killing more than
270 people and injuring hundreds more.
   The quake Thursday, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale,
collapsed buildings across the region as well as a section of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and at least two spans in the
Santa Cruz area. Severed gas lines sparked fires, including one in
San Francisco that burned a block of buildings.
   The magnitude of the catastrophe emerged slowly as officials
made contact with hard-hit areas, where many telephones were cut
off. As many as 1 million people were left without power and other
services.
   ``This is just a devastating, terrible, terrible situation
beyond everybody's imagination,'' said Marty Boyer, the Alameda
County spokesman.
   Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy this morning put the death toll at 271.
State emergency services spokesman John Peterson said at least 272
people had died and 650 were injured. At least 253 people were
killed when a half-mile section of the upper level of Interstate
880 in Oakland collapsed onto the lower level, said Dave Wilson of
the state Office of Emergency Services.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' said Leroy FitzGerald,
who works nearby. ``You could hear people screaming for help.''
   Tractors, bulldozers and dump trucks were called out, and trucks
and vans took bodies from the site this morning.
   The quake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesay along a segment of the might
San Andreas Fault eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles
south of San Francisco. Aftershocks today included one measuring
4.5 on the Richter scale at 3:25 a.m., according to the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   McCarthy said damage would total ``the better part of a billion
dollars.''
   ``You could see dozens, huge booms of smoke going into the
air,'' said Greg Higgins, who was driving near Santa Cruz, close to
the quake's epicenter, when it struck. ``It was complete
pandemonium.''
   The quake sent thousands of terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of Oakland and San Francisco, and many remained
stranded hours later.
   ``I've never been through anything like this in my life,'' said
Mary Garcia, who works in Oakland's Clorox building. ``I was on the
17th floor and the building just rocked and rocked. I was scared
out of my mind coming down the 17 floors.''
   Authorities urged people to fill their bathtubs in case water
was cut off. San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos urged commuters to stay
home today rather than further taxing the transportation system,
crippled by the closing of the Bay Bridge. A section of its top
collapsed onto the lower roadway.
   At least two bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed, highways
leading out of the city were damaged, and mountain passes outside
of Santa Cruz were closed because of landslides and fissures in the
road, the Highway Patrol said.
   In San Francisco, at least eight people died, and looting and
vandalism were reported in the city's major crack dealing area
after dark. ``When the power is off, opportunists come out,''
police Dispatcher Chris Curran said.
   Agnos asked the Army to help. National Guardsmen were being
mobilized, including engineers, military police and medical workers.
   Still, Agnos said, ``The city is in reasonably good shape. We've
survived this so far.''
   Sixty-thousand baseball fans were evacuated from Candlestick
Park before the start of Game Three of the World Series. No major
injuries were reported at the stadium, which sustained structural
damage, and there was no word this morning on when the game would
be played.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through a darkened San Francisco. Headlights and an occasional
office building running on emergency generators stood out. Buses
were jammed and traffic was backed up.
   Commuters were left with no major transportation routes east out
of San Francisco because of the closing of the Bay Bridge, two
other spans and the Oakland-San Francisco subway, which apparently
was unscathed by the quake.
   Tourist ferries helped fill the void, giving stranded commuters
free rides from San Francisco to the East Bay.
   People walked around San Francisco, sat outside dingy hotels or
on stoops and curbs, listening to radio reports of the disaster.
Without power, there was no television. Restaurants and bars opened
with candlelight.
   Agnos said five people died in the city after buildings
collapsed on cars, and three died in San Francisco's Marina
district in a spectacular fire that burned much of the evening
before being brought under control.
   Up to 20 people were hurt in the fire, officials said.
   Police Chief Fred Jordan said the fire appeared to have consumed
an entire block, estimated by Agnos to be 12 buildings. The fire
apparently was caused by a natural gas leak, Agnos said.
   State emergency officials said at least five people died in
Santa Cruz County, including three crushed in collapsing buildings.
   One San Jose resident suffered a heart attack during the quake
and died.
   Willis Jacobs of the earthquake center said the quake was
centered about eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz, or 75 miles
south of San Francisco, along the San Andreas Fault. That is the
major earthquake fault blamed for the 1906 disaster that destroyed
much of the city and killed hundreds _ 700, according to
traditional estimates, and more than 2,500, according to recent
studies.
   In San Francisco's Haight-Fillmore district, cracks were visible
on some stoops and buildings, some in the stucco and some
structural. Many buildings in the neighborhood are Victorian-style
homes that survived the 1906 earthquake.
   A 30-foot section of the upper deck of the bridge connecting
Oakland and San Francisco collapsed, leaving three cars dangling
between the levels.
   CBS said the California Highway Patrol reported a J.C. Penney
building in downtown Hollister collapsed, as did a bridge on a
highway near Hollister.
   Gov. George Deukmejian cut short a trade mission to Frankfurt,
West Germany, and flew home. ``The devastation is just horrible and
we're just shocked,'' Deukmejian said before returning.
   In Washington, President Bush dispatched Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner to California to assess the damage. Vice
President Dan Quayle landed early today at Moffett Naval Air
Station, between San Francisco and San Jose.
   The quake was felt in Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the northeast; as
far north as the Russian River area, 70 miles to the north; 180
miles southeast in Fresno and 80 miles due east in Stockton.
High-rises in Los Angeles, 350 miles south of San Francisco, also
shook.
   At least four smaller aftershocks were recorded, said Bruce
Presgrave of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden.
More were expected, but Presgrave said he did not expect them to be
strong.
   There were no reports of damage to the Golden Gate Bridge that
connects San Francisco to Marin County, to the north. The San Mateo
bridge, which crosses 10 miles south of Candlestick Park, was
closed for inspection, as was the Dumbarton Bridge, about 30 miles
south of San Francisco.
   The Oakland Airport and the San Francisco International Airport
were both closed. The San Jose International Airport was open with
only minor damage.

<HEAD>World Leaders Send Sympathy; Pope Prays For Quake Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The pope sent prayers and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
offered relief aid today as the world expressed grief for the
victims of the devastating earthquake in northern California.
   Thousands jammed international phone lines seeking to get in
touch with relatives in the area hit by Tuesday's quake, which
killed more than 270 people, flattened brides and buildings and
started fires in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Offers of aid came from the Philippines, Japan, France, Britain,
Switzerland and several other nations. An estimated 500,000
Filipinos live in the San Francisco area, one of the largest
Filipino communities in the world.
   ``I would also like to extend my sympathy in a very special way
to our countrymen residing in the area,'' President Corazon Aquino
said in a statement. ``They have our nation's collective prayers
for their safety, and I am directing our Philippine consulate there
to extend whatever help they can to them.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent condolences in a telegram to
President Bush today, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry official said his countrymen
understand the grief of the Americans because of the quake in
Armenia that killed 25,000 people less than a year ago.
   Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet envoy to Washington, was assigned to
contact the Bush administration to learn ``what sort of aid could
be given by the Soviet side, by government or social channels,
towards liquidating the consequences of the earthquake,'' the
official Tass news agency said.
   If the Soviets do help the victims of an American quake, it
would be a first. Millions of dollars of U.S. assistance, along
with aid from numerous other countries, poured into Armenia
following the Dec. 7 quake in the Soviet republic.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a
government news briefing the consequences of the Armenian disaster
made the Soviets especially sensitive to the plight of California
residents stricken by the Tuesday quake.
   ``For the Soviet people, who experienced not long ago the pain
of loss from the catastrophe in Armenia, the feelings of grief that
the American people are feeling today are especially close and
understandable,'' Gerasimov told reporters in Moscow.
   A team of four to six British engineers specializing in
earthquake safety design will fly to San Francisco Thursday to help
assess damage, said Alistair Soane, chairman of the consulting firm
Bingham Cotterell in northwest England.
   ``They will be assisting in the damage assessment and learning
lessons to apply for the next time, because there will be a next
time in San Francisco,'' he said.
   Three Swiss experts left for California today to assess what
help their country might give to the earthquake-stricken area. A
French disaster-relief agency also offered to send specialists to
San Francisco to find any survivors trapped under rubble.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu offered help in rescue and
rebuilding efforts.
   ``As we ourselves are so vulnerable to this natural disaster
that we view the fate of its victims much as that of our own ... we
are following the news from San Francisco with intense care,'' he
said in a message to Bush.
   ``We are prepared to contribute to your efforts of emergency
rescue and reconstruction as much as we can.''
   Thousands of Asians jammed trans-Pacific telephone lines seeking
word of relatives in California.
   ``Every second we get calls for California from those with
relatives there,'' said one of the 100 telephone operators on duty
at the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. ``Sometimes they
beg us to connect them but our circuits are down, and we tell them
that much as we want to help them we can't do anything,'' she said.
   In Rome, a Vatican spokesman said Pope John Paul II was ``deeply
saddened'' by the deaths and destruction in the earthquake and was
praying for the victims.
   ``His Holiness joins the population in their suffering and
offering special prayers to God for San Francisco and surrounding
areas,'' said a telegram sent by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the
Vatican secretary of state, to Archbishop John Quinn of San
Francisco.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent a message to Bush
offering help.
   ``I am very distressed indeed to hear of what is clearly a major
disaster and hasten to send my deepest sympathy to you and all
those who have suffered,'' she said in a statement released by her
office.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand also expressed condolences to Bush.

   A pharmaceuticals executive was fined $150,000
and placed on 18 months' probation for bribing a Food and Drug
Administration chemist in a generic drug scam.
   Ashok Patel, 49, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., was also sentenced
Tuesday a year of community service.
   The former senior vice president of Par Pharmaceuticals of
Spring Valley, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to paying a $500
gratuity to FDA chemist David Brancato.
   Prosecutors said Patel paid Brancato a total of $1,600 to
influence FDA approval of Par generic drugs. He was also accused of
paying $2,900 to Charles Chang, Brancato's boss in the FDA generic
drug division.
   Generic drugs are the chemical equivalents of brand-name drugs.
The rush by generic companies to get approval from the FDA for
their cheaper products has created a lucrative market susceptible
to corruption, investigators said.
   Authorities are investigating allegations that FDA chemists
accepted cash for inside information and favorable treatment of
drug applications.
   Earlier this month, Chang was fined $10,000, ordered to spend a
year in a work-release program and perform 1,000 hours of community
service. Brancato is to be sentenced Wednesday.
   The investigation so far has resulted in guilty pleas from three
generic drug company officials, three FDA chemists and two
pharmaceutical companies.

   Police patrolled for looters in the
historic downtown district today and hundreds of people who spent
the night in shelters faced homes and businesses destroyed by the
earthquake centered near here.
   At least five people died in Santa Cruz and surroundings, said
Dinah Phillips, the county's emergency services coordinator. Some
officials put the local death toll from Tuesday's quake as high as
14, but that could immediately be confirmed. More than 200 were
killed in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Devastation also was widespread in Los Gatos, 40 miles to the
northeast. Several blocks in the commercial old town district and
two homes were destroyed, and 30 houses were knocked off
foundations.
   ``Many buildings have collapsed. Damages are in the millions and
millions of dollars,'' said Police Chief Larry Todd. There were no
deaths, but about 25 people suffered injuries ranging from broken
bones to heart attacks.
   Gas and water lines burst and electricity was cut by the quake.
Authorities said it could take up to 72 hours to restore power and
water to Los Gatos.
   Some looting was reported in Los Gatos' central business
district, but no arrests were made, Todd said.
   In Watsonville, dozens of people camped overnight in an open lot
at a subdivision. Some 350 people stayed in six shelters in Santa
Cruz and Watsonville, Ms. Phillips said. In Los Gatos, about 75
people spent the night in Red Cross shelters or at a high school
football stadium.
   Authorities were thankful for the relatively low death toll in
the coastal Santa Cruz area, the closest to the earthquake's
epicenter. The quake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale of ground
motion.
   ``To have an earthquake of this magnitude, and to have as few
fatalities as we've had, I think we were very lucky,'' Ms. Phillips
said.
   Two people were killed when a department store and a coffee
sales shop collapsed in a downtown Santa Cruz shopping mall, she
said.
   Another person died in a traffic accident south of the city when
the car struck horses that had gotten loose on Highway 1, Ms.
Phillips said. One person died when a bakery shop collapsed in
Watsonville, 15 miles south of Santa Cruz; an elderly nursing home
patient in Santa Cruz died of a heart attack.
   The cave-ins were among 40 buildings that collapsed in the two
cities, she said. Preliminary damage estimates totaled $250 million
to private property and $100 million to public property, she said.
   The historic Pacific Garden Mall, a renovated downtown shopping
center of gardens and brick walkways, suffered significant damage.
   National Guard soldiers searched for victims in the rubble well
into the night.
   ``Virtually all the buildings in the Pacific Garden Mall have
structural problems and broken glass,'' said city spokesman Larry
Pearson. ``Many may need to be demolished and others need
reinforcing.''
   Several buildings along a six-block area at the heart of the
development crumbled during the temblor. Ford's, a downtown
department store, sustained major damage and was the site of one
death.
   Twisted mannequins lay in the street atop a pile of broken
glass. Sections of wall collapsed, spewing debris and dust.
   James Campos, a security guard at the mall, said he helped pull
a woman out of the rubble, only later to learn she had died.
   ``The dust was like fog,'' Campos said.
   The quake touched off fires that destroyed nearly 20 homes and
businesses around the county. Two wildfires raged well into the
night before they were contained.
   ``We had so many broken gas lines it was just unbelievable,''
said Matt Ryan, a reserve firefighter standing watch at one
destroyed home.
   Officials in Watsonville described property damage there as
extensive, particularly to brick structures around the town square.
   ``We have no power, a lot of property damage, and some
injuries,'' said police Lt. M. Aluffi.
   Lacking power, Santa Cruz was blacked out overnight. Most roads
from Santa Cruz to the San Francisco area were closed by landslides
or fissures sewn into them by the quake.
   At least two bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed and other
highways leading out of the city suffered significant damage, said
Officer Kim Penrose of the California Highway Patrol.
   ``All the mountain passes are closed because of major landslides
and fissures in the road,'' Penrose said.

<HEAD>Soviets Offer Aid to Quake Victims; Gorbachev Sends Condolences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government made an unprecedented offer of
relief aid to the United States today and said Soviet citizens can
sympathize with victims of the earthquake in California.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent condolences to earthquake
victims in a telegram to President Bush, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news briefing.
   Asked what aid the Soviet Union might have to offer, Gerasimov
said, ``It's hard for me to say. We have a very sad experience in
the earthquake in Armenia.''
   A quake in the southern Soviet republic of approximately the
same magnitude as the San Francisco quake left 25,000 dead last
winter. Despite an influx of Soviet and foreign aid, much of the
area is still in ruins.
   If the Soviets do help the victims of an American quake, it
would be a first. Millions of dollars of U.S. assistance, along
with aid from numerous other countries, poured into Armenia
following the Dec. 7 quake there.
   It was the first time the Soviets, faced with a gigantic natural
disaster, accepted such relief assistance from abroad.
   Gerasimov said Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet envoy to Washington, was
urgently instructed ``to get in touch with the American
administration so that we are clear on what are the issues which
are the spheres of possible help.''
   Gorbachev expressed ``sincere sympathy'' for quake victims in
his telegram to Bush, Gerasimov said.
   He told reporters the consequences of the Armenian disaster made
the Soviets especially sensitive to the plight of California
residents stricken by the Tuesday quake.
   ``For the Soviet people, who experienced not long ago the pain
of loss from the catastrophe in Armenia, the feelings of grief that
the American people are feeling today are especially close and
understandable,'' Gerasimov said.

<HEAD>New Drug Best Yet in Stopping Organ Rejection, Surgeon Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES throughout with comments from surgeon. No pickup. ADDS

<TEXT>
   A new drug that prevents and even reverses
rejection of transplanted organs is 50 to 100 times more powerful
than medication now used and is also less toxic, a leading
transplant surgeon said today.
   ``It's a marvelous drug,'' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the
University of Pittsburgh, who headed the team responsible for its
development. ``It's the best drug that has been put out to this
time.''
   The drug, FK-506, appears to be an eventual replacement for
cyclosporine, the major anti-rejection drug now being used, he
said. It may also lower transplantation costs and prove useful in
treating other disorders.
   ``The biggest bonus is better survival,'' Starzl said in a
telephone interview this morning.
   Dr. Robert Corry, president of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, said he has not yet reviewed the findings but has ``every
reason to believe that Dr. Starzl is correct.''
   ``He certainly has made enormous contributions and this may be
yet another one that he's done,'' Corry said.
   Starzl performed the world's first liver transplant in 1963 and
pioneered the use of cyclosporine in the early 1980s. He first
tried FK-506 on a patient in February.
   Starzl and other University of Pittsburgh doctors have since
administered the drug to 111 patients, including a few children.
   The liver, heart, kidney, pancreas and lung recipients were
given FK-506 after cyclosporine failed to work as intended or their
transplanted organs had failed, Starzl said.
   The new drug has been used on humans for only eight months,
making it difficult to predict the drug's long-term side effects,
Starzl said. So far, though, it has not caused kidney failure, the
leading side effect of cyclosporine.
   Researchers assume that FK-506, like other anti-rejection drugs,
will increase patients' risk of getting cancer. That risk, however,
probably will be ``not enough to cancel the effect and usefulness
of this drug,'' Starzl said.
   FK-506 also has reduced the need for steroids, normally
administered with cyclosporine to help prevent rejection, said
Starzl.
   Seventy-five to 80 percent of all patients receiving new livers
in Pittsburgh, the world's leading transplant center, have properly
functioning organs a year after surgery, he said. The success rate
could climb to nearly 100 percent with FK-506, he said.
   Starzl plans to present his findings later this month in
Barcelona, Spain.
   A record 1,680 liver transplants were performed in the United
States, among 12,798 organ transplants last year, according to the
United Network for Organ Sharing.
   As of Monday, 18,453 people were awaiting organ transplants in
the United States, the network said.
   Starzl said there is no reason for the time being for a patient
to switch to FK-506 if cyclosporine is not producing serious
problems.
   The New York Times reported today that some scientists believe
the apparent success of the drug, derived from a fungus found in
Japan, could worsen the already high shortage of donor organs
because it would greatly increase the number of successful
transplants.
   Starzl discounted that notion.
   ``Theoretically, it should improve the donor supply in that
people might be more accepting of transplantation with much better
results,'' Corry said.
   Increased success rates mean fewer patients will require
additional transplants, Starzl said. Twenty percent of Pittsburgh's
liver transplant patients need another transplant within 60 days of
surgery, he said.
   Starzl said FK-506 also will likely reduce the cost of liver
transplants, which exceeds $100,000, by as much as one-third
because of speedier recovery and less need for blood tests to
monitor the drug's effectiveness.
   Starzl's team plans wider use of the drug to treat disorders
that impair the immune system and affect the skin, eyes, bowel,
kidney and brain, the Times said.
   The University of Pittsburgh is the only center with government
approval to test the drug, manufactured by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical
Company Ltd. of Osaka, Japan.
   Dr. Gregory P. Burk of the Food and Drug Administration told the
Times that the agency has encouraged Starzl to submit patient
records and other data for examination so it can determine whether
to move quickly to allow other doctors to use the drug.

   The Senate sent President Bush legislation
today providing $1.8 million for pensions, office costs and other
expenses of the nation's four living former presidents and Lady
Bird Johnson.
   On a voice vote, the Senate gave final congressional approval to
a spending bill containing the money. There was no debate, and only
four senators were in the chamber when the measure passed.
   The House approved the legislation Tuesday on a 383-30 vote.
   Under a 1958 law, the government each year provides former
presidents and their widows with pensions and money for their
office space, furnishings, equipment, staffs, telephone, mail and
travel.
   This year, the legislation provides $559,500 for Ronald Reagan,
$387,800 for Jimmy Carter, $426,800 for Gerald Ford, $426,700 for
Richard Nixon and $22,200 for the widow of Lyndon Johnson.
   Each president's annual pension is $99,500. Their other expenses
vary.
   The figures do not include the costs of the Secret Service for
protecting the former chief executives. The Secret Service is
expected to spend $12.5 million this year to provide security to
the former presidents and their families.
   There was no separate vote on the money for the former
presidents. But at one point Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., complained
about the costs, singling out Reagan's plans to travel to Japan
shortly to reportedly deliver a pair of speeches for a $2 million
fee. He said it was an ``unmitigated atrocity'' for Reagan to make
such a trip with the help of taxpayers' money.
   ``This Congress should examine whether we are too great in our
largesse in providing services and costs to former presidents who
engage in personal income endeavors,'' he said.
   The money was included in an $18.4 billion spending bill for the
Treasury Department, Postal Service and several smaller agencies
for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
   Other parts of the bill provide:
   _$200,000 to renovate rooms in the vice president's formal
residence to accomodate the young family of Dan Quayle. The Quayle
family had said they would raise money privately to pay for the
work.
   _A 3.6 percent pay raise for all federal civilian employees
except for members of Congress, federal judges, and top executive
branch officials.
   _A prohibition against the use of federal employee health
benefits to pay for abortions unless the woman's life is endangered
by the pregnancy.
   _Grants to several schools represented by members of Congress'
appropriations committees, including $1.5 million for the Rochester
Institute of Technology, $5 million for Michigan Technological
Institute, $1.5 million for the University of Maryland, $1 million
for the University of Hawaii; and $4 million for the University of
Texas, El Paso.
   _Other grants to institutions favored by committee members,
including $2 million to develop a Marine Biomedical Institute for
Advance Studies at Woods Hole, Mass.; $1.5 million for a science
center at Smith College in Massachusetts; and $1.5 million to
design a marine research center in Baltimore.

<TEXT>
   The CIA, weary of student protests, will
no longer hold job interviews at Middlebury College, a CIA
recruiter says.
   ``I will not come back on campus to do any more recruiting. I
promise you that,'' Brian P. Peters, chief of the agency's New
England recruitment center, told 15 students Tuesday who staged a
two-hour sit-in at Middlebury's placement office.
   More than 50 students, faculty members and townspeople
demonstrated outside.
   To end the sit-in, Peters, one of two recruiters conducting
interviews, signed a paper drafted by the protesters agreeing he
``will not initiate interviews'' at the 1,600-student school.
   ``I can't be speaking for the entire agency,'' he added. ``We
could have a change of command tomorrow.'' But Peters said he would
be in charge of recruiting in New England for three more years and
would abide by the agreement.
   Middlebury officials say they will now have to decide to what
extent the college's career counseling service will continue to
help students who want to interview with the CIA.
   The student protesters were demanding that the counseling office
not act as a liaison between interested seniors and the CIA.
   ``It's a fairly legitimate employment option for our students
and there is by no means consensus on campus about this,'' Dean of
Students Karl Lindholm said of the anit-CIA protest.
   The protesters criticized the agency's policy of not hiring
homosexuals and charged that the CIA is morally corrupt.

   The Soviet Union has boosted military aid to
Afghanistan, prolonging the bloody civil war in that country,
members of Congress said today.
   The Soviets this month increased the amount of arms in daily air
cargo shipments to the Afghan capital of Kabul and are sending Scud
missiles that are being fired against guerrilla positions by 300
Red Army advisers, Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., told a news conference.
   Ritter estimated Soviet arms deliveries to Kabul at $400 million
in October. The previous level was estimated by government
officials at between $250 million and $300 million a month.
   U.S. military aid to Afghanistan's mujahedeen guerrillas has
been running at $550 million to $600 million per year, according to
congressional sources. The exact level of the covert American
program is classified.
   The Afghan and Soviet governments boosted the proportion of
weapons in air cargo sent to Kabul from about two-thirds of the
daily volume to about three-quarters, Ritter said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Monday that an
earlier boost in Soviet arms deliveries had prolonged the fighting.
   ``These disturbing actions, this seeming preference for military
solutions, may work in the short run to keep a Najibullah ... in
power,'' Baker. ``In the long run, however, only political
solutions can settle these conflicts.''
   One administration analyst, however, said calculating the exact
tonnage and value of Soviet arms shipments to Kabul was very
uncertain, and stressed the mujahedeen also were beset by internal
rivalries and disorganization.
   The increase in Soviet arms shipments, and problems among the
guerrillas, have prompted the United States to find new arms routes
to the mujahedeen, say congressional and administration sources.
   The CIA, working through Pakistani intelligence, is sending
fewer arms through seven resistance parties based in Peshawar,
Pakistan, and channeling them instead to guerrilla commanders who
control the countryside and who increasingly are thought to hold
the key to Afghanistan's future, according to the sources.
   Neither the exile Afghan Interim Government, formed last
February when the Soviets withdrew, nor the guerrilla commanders
have shown inclination to compromise with Najibullah. Forces loyal
to Najibullah remain entrenched in Kabul and other major cities,
and the battlelines have shifted little since the Red Army left.
   U.S. arms shipments slowed to a trickle at the beginning of the
fighting season last summer, say administration, congressional and
Afghan sources, although that point is in dispute.
   Some arms shipments were disrupted last summer because of the
turmoil in China, which sends arms by rail to Pakistan for
distribution to the mujahedeen, according to a report released Oct.
1 by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.

   Two teen-agers suspected in a bank
robbery were seconds away from what they thought would be their
flight to freedom when their wings were clipped by police.
   The suspects, ages 16 and 17, were aboard a United Airlines
plane Tuesday at Kent County International Airport awaiting takeoff
to Orlando, Fla., when the pilot returned the aircraft to the
terminal, telling passengers there were mechanical difficulties.
   Airport police had contacted the pilot seconds earlier, saying
the two suspects were aboard, police said. When the pair walked off
the plane with the other passengers, police were waiting.
   The two Lowell-area teen-agers, who awaited arraignment today,
used rifles in a hold-up at a bank in Alto hours earlier and
escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash, police said.
   Investigators identified the suspects from a bank camera, and a
tip helped police track them to the airport.
   ``The first one (airport police) checked was United Airlines,''
said Detective Jerry Miedema. ``They were already on the plane with
one-way tickets.''
   Investigators said they recovered some of the money. A portion
was spent on the tickets, they said.

   The nation's poverty rate was 13.1 percent
last year, about the same as in 1987, the Census Bureau reported
today. That means 31.9 million Americans were living in poverty in
1988.
   In 1987, about 32.3 million people, or 13.4 percent of the
population, were living in poverty. The Census Bureau said the
changes between 1987 and 1988 were not statistically significant.
   The Census Bureau also reported that Americans' median household
income was $27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier after
adjusting for the rise in consumer prices. Again, the change was
not considered significant.
   Per capita income, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent to an all-time
high of $13,120 in 1988, a change that was considered significant.
   ``It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or
improved,'' said William Butz, associate director for demographics
at the Census Bureau.
   The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by
0.3 percentage point last year to 10.1 percent. The poverty rate
for blacks was 31.6 percent, down from 32.6 percent in 1987, and
the rate for Hispanics dipped to 26.8 percent from 28.1 percent.
None of those changes was considered significant.
   Regionally, the only statistically significant change in the
poverty rate occurred in the Midwest, where the rate dropped from
12.5 percent in 1987 to 11.5 percent last year. The poverty rate in
the South was 16.2 percent in 1988, up from 16.1 percent a year
earlier. In the West, the rate was 12.7 percent, up from 12.5
percent, and in the Northeast, the rate was 10.2 percent, down from
10.9 percent.
   Today's report on poverty in 1988 was prepared by the Census
Bureau based on a survey of about 58,000 U.S. households last March.
   While debate rages over the cost and adequacy of programs to
fight poverty, battles also continue over defining and counting it.
   Advocates for the poor insist the formal definition
underestimates the problem because it doesn't really reflect their
spending habits.
   But other researchers contend the measurement may overestimate
poverty because it only considers people's cash income and not
government assistance.
   The official definition of poverty was developed by the Social
Security Administration in 1964 based on Department of Agriculture
Research on what people spend on food.
   Agriculture analysts had calculated that people spent about
one-third of their income to eat, and developed a variety of plans
to provide adequate nutrition at high, middle and low cost levels.
   The definition of poverty was then set at three times the cost
of the lowest price food program, known as the thrifty food plan.
   Adjusted annually for inflation, the poverty threshold has risen
from about $3,000 per year in the early 1960s to nearly $12,000
today for a family of four. The poverty level varies slightly for
urban and rural residents and rises with the size of family. Many
assistance programs kick in at 125 percent of the poverty rate.
   In recent years advocates for the poor have challenged the
definition of poverty, contending the cost of living has changed
over the years. The rising cost of housing has been a particular
problem, they say, leaving the poor with less than in the past for
food and other necessities.
   With food now a smaller share of the minimum cost of living, the
poverty rate underestimates the number of poor, they contend.
   In addition, the annual poverty estimates do not include the
growing army of homeless people, although most would certainly
qualify as poor.
   But economists at the Commerce Department say poverty may be
overestimated because the definition doesn't include government
benefits.
   Assistance programs such as food stamps, subsidized housing and
medical assistance help people defray their cost of living, these
statisticians say, but are not considered when poverty is
calculated.
   The annual reports in recent years have included supplements
showing somewhat lower poverty rates if the value of benefits is
considered, although debate continues on how to calculate the worth
of some programs.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Oct. 17
   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the stock market:
   The first question to ask about Friday's sudden market panic
isn't why it happened when it did, but why it didn't happen sooner.
   The economy is awash in debt, making everyone constantly uneasy.
Virtually any bad news can cause a sell-off. Friday was simply an
accident waiting to happen, and though Monday didn't bring more of
the same, as many investors feared, the bulls have hardly run the
bears out of town.
   There are two messages in this, one urgent, the other only
slightly less so.
   The first is the need to improve regulation of the securities
markets to prevent a panic from getting out of hand. Some measures
have been taken since the great plunge of '87, but not nearly
enough.
   The second imperative: The indebtedness of business, government
and the nation must finally be reduced.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on states filling a policy vacuum:
   Recently the federal government has displayed a new kind of
usefulness. It allows the states to lead when a policy vacuum
exists at the federal level.
   California, the state most plagued by auto-created air polution,
required refiners to change the mix of gasoline ingredients to
inhibit evaporation of unburned fuel. Acting on California's
example, New Jersey, New York and the six New England states
jointly decided last year to do the same. This spring the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency said it would implement the
requirement on a national basis.
   The pattern now seems to be repeating itself in regard to
anti-pollution equipment on automobiles.
   The states are leading because the Reagan administration beat a
retreat on clean-air policy and the Bush administration has acted
only tentatively to reverse it. Unless there is bolder federal
action on other environmental problems, many more such national
campaigns will be born in the state capitals.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on clean air legislation:
   If more evidence were needed that President Bush is lagging
behind Americans' strong support for stricter clean air rules, a
House subcommittee has provided it by agreeing to extend
California's tough auto emissions standards to the rest of the
nation by 1996. ...
   The House should regard the amended auto emissions measure as a
minimum standard. Bipartisan support already has emerged in the
Senate for even tougher anti-smog rules. The Senate version is, in
fact, better than its counterpart in the House.
   The final legislative package, due on the president's desk by
Jan. 1, ought to reflect Americans' growing demand for cleaner air
and their willingness to pay reasonably higher costs to achieve it.
That's a message Bush needs to take to heart.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on flag-burning:
   Considering the social and budgetary problems confronting the
nation, one would think that President Bush and members of Congress
would be too busy to waste time on the non-existent problem of
flag-burning.
   Think again.
   It's been almost four months since the U.S. Supreme Court struck
(down) flag-desecration laws in 48 states, plus a federal statute.
...
   There has not been a rash of flag burnings since the June 21
ruling. There has been some criticism of the decision. But,
overall, many Americans seem to be coming to the understanding that
launching a legal attack on freedom of expression is an even
greater danger than flag desecration. ...
   Rather than waste any more time on the flag issue, Congress
ought to recognize that the right to dissent is essential to
freedom. Trying to protect the flag with questionable laws and
long-shot amendments weakens rather than strengthens the freedoms
the flag symbolizes.

   The Saginaw (Mich.) News on education in United States:
   Just before the Gallup Poll turned up the latest evidence that
American education fails to educate Americans, The New York Times
published a pained account by a fiftyish journalist appalled at the
vacant minds of her juniors.
   She told of a reporter working on a music story who interviewed
Pierre Boulez, a famed composer and conductor, without the
slightest inkling of his background.
   She mentioned a radio producer who could not identify a
``campy'' piece of theme music. The names of singer Dinah Shore and
songwriter Jerome Kern meant nothing.
   Well, not everyone is going to keep in mind every factoid. But
when young professionals know so little about their own field,
there should be no surprise when the Gallup Poll reports that a
fourth of students draw a blank on the date 1492, or that 42
percent cannot come within a half-century of placing the Civil War.
...
   The remedy is as simple as a new classroom focus: Elementary
facts first _ then creativity. That would cost little compared to
the long-term price of sending educated fools out into the world.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Denied Chance to Defend Editor on Legislature Floor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with seven grafs to UPDATE with Yeltsin claiming Gorbachev
trying to purge him; picks up 4th graf: The tabloid .. .</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

   Lawmakers in Parliament today were denied the
chance to defend a daring editor who had been rebuked by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and is in danger of being fired, one of the
parliamentarians said.
   It was the second time the group of lawmakers was kept from
speaking in the Supreme Soviet legislature. Nikolai A. Kutsenko, a
deputy from the Ukraine, said the group will submit a petition
signed by 34 legislators accusing Gorbachev of using ``pressure
tactics'' that contradict his own reforms.
   Also today, Communist lawmaker Boris N. Yeltsin accused
Gorbachev of masterminding a campaign to purge him from politics.
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin, who was ousted as Moscow's Communist
Party boss in 1987 but staged a spectacular comeback by winning a
seat in this spring's legislative elections, made the claim in a
printed statement.
   On Monday, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the Supreme
Soviet of an investigation into Yeltsin's report of an attack on
his life. Bakatin said police found the charge to be unfounded, and
Yeltsin replied on the floor of the legislature that the affair
stemmed from a joke he made to a policeman.
   The strange encounter was carried on the national evening news
program, Vremya. Yeltsin accused Gorbachev of making a ``new
attempt to ruin my health and knock me out of the sphere of
political struggle.''
   Meanwhile, Kutsenko said leaders of the Supreme Soviet
legislature decided not to permit the defense of Vladislav A.
Starkov, editor of the weekly Arguments and Facts, to be raised at
the legislature because they considered it an affair of the
Communist Party rather than the government.
   The tabloid was responsible for several sensational stories in
the past year, including the first Soviet disclosure that dictator
Josef Stalin imprisoned or killed as many as 40 million people. It
was also the first Soviet publication to print excerpts of the
memoirs of Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   Kutsenko said he wanted to speak at this morning's session of
the legislature but was told he could not have the floor by
Gorbachev's hand-picked vice president, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, and
the chairmen of the bicameral legislature's two houses, Rafik N.
Nishanov and Yevgeny M. Primakov.
   The petition Kutsenko hoped to read on the floor of the
legislature accuses Gorbachev of trying to discredit the weekly. He
tried to be recognized at Tuesday's evening session, but was denied
the floor by Lukyanov.
   Gorbachev lashed out at selected Soviet editors at a closed-door
Communist Party meeting Friday in an apparent attempt to regain a
measure of control over the press, which has been carrying daily
reports critical of the Soviet system and occasionally of its
leaders.
   The journalists, quoting their bosses who attended and asking
not to be identified, said Gorbachev accused Starkov and other
editors of seeking his political downfall when the nation is torn
by economic crisis and ethnic strife.
   One journalist said Gorbachev likened the situation in the
country to a lake of gasoline that could be set afire by a single
match.
   Soviet journalists said chief party ideologist Vadim A. Medvedev
has told Starkov he must resign and offered him a post at the state
publishing committee, but that Starkov intended to fight to keep
his job.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov called today for
journalists around the world to stand up for Starkov.
   ``I call on journalists of the world to defend him,'' Sakharov,
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told The Associated Press in
an interview outside the Supreme Soviet hall.
   Sakharov also called on the Supreme Soviet today to strip the
Communist Party of its constitutional monopoly on power, calling it
an anachronism. Most lawmakers appeared to dismiss the idea.
   Known for critical and poignant articles written in plain
language, the weekly Arguments and Facts is the country's most
widely read newspaper, with a circulation of 26 million.
   The tabloid recently calculated that according to readers' mail,
Sakharov was more popular than Gorbachev or any other member of the
Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.

   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on child-care:
   After months of wrangling, the House and Senate are close to
agreeing on a child-care bill. Already it's clear that the
legislation will be inferior to President Bush's original proposal.
He should veto it.
   During his presidential campaign last year, Bush stressed his
commitment to provide some form of relief for families with working
parents, and rightly so. The need for day care is among the
nation's fastest growing concerns. ...
   Cost estimates for the Democratic plans range from $10.3 billion
to $22 billion over the next five years. They target not just the
poor but also families who make as much as 100 percent of their
state's median family income.
   While some tax credits _ the heart of Bush's plan _ are
included, the bulk of the money will go toward block grants to
subsidize institutional child-care facilities. And attached to
those federal funds is a raft of regulations, along with the
bureacracy to make sure they're followed to the letter.
   The White House has already labeled the final child-care bill,
whatever its precise form, a ``veto candidate.'' Now the president
should follow through, and then tell Congress to take another look
at his own, perfectly sound proposal.

   We've had arms control summits and economic summits; recently we

drug summit ... in Latin America. ...
   (Summits) are mostly useless ceremonial exercises that result in
nothing more substantial than a considerable burnishing of the
participants' public images. ...
   The recent education summit resulted in nothing more than a
resolution to appoint a study panel to set goals for education in
America. ...
   What is needed is grass-roots support for real improvements, and
it's difficult to see how the summit-appointed study panel will
help.
   It is likewise difficult to imagine what sort of substantial
action could result from the planned drug summit. ...

excessively building up expectations in advance. Summits are mostly
theater.

Peru and Bolivia to attend a ``drug summit'' within the next 90
days. ...
   There's certainly nothing wrong with that ... but he and his
advisers should take pains to ensure that there will be more to the
drug summit than photo opportunities and rhetorical variations on
the theme that the traffic in illicit drugs is a Really Bad Thing.
   Bush must carry to the meeting ... proposals for aiding the
governments of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia in their struggle with
the traffickers _ proposals including economic incentives, law
enforcement assistance and, if requested, military aid.

   Valley News, Lebanon, N.H., on U.S.-Chile:
   While politicians in Washington exchange accusations over who is
to blame for the failure to overthrow Panama's Manuel Noriega, the
people of Chile are quietly preparing for presidential elections in
December. For them, it will be the first meaningful election since
1973, when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Salvadore Allende.
   Chile provides an instructive comparison to Panama because it,
too, had to free itself from the rule of a ruthless dictator. In
the case of Chile, the United States let the Chilean people do the
work of delivering themselves from an unwanted government.
   While Washington has made clear its distaste for the Pinochet
government, it left the job of pressuring the military government
into reform to the people who were suffrering under its rule.
   There is no morally defensible way that the United States can
pick and choose among nations in which it wants to play kingmaker.

   Swaggering Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega plays heavily on Latin
America's traditional fear of ``Yanqui imperialism'' to dignify his
criminal rule in Panama, but the old trick didn't work.
   The Group of Eight, an organization of Latin American nations,
said in Ica, Peru, that Panama's suspension from the regional forum
would continue until democracy is restored in Panama.
   Panamanians have further reason to rid themselves of Noriega:
national pride. Noriega and his mob have been branded usurpers.
Panamanians can erase the ensuing blot on their nation's reputation
only by giving Noreiga the boot.

Afghanistan. ...
   Bush should let the Panama crisis cool. He should bide his time.
Noriega can't last.

   Los Angeles Times on Panama:
   Bush Administration officials seem to take criticism of their
performance during the failed Panamanian coup as a challenge to
prove they are not wimps. But they must not lose sight of what is
really at stake in Panama. ...
   President Bush repeated at a Friday press conference his desire
to see Noriega ousted. Insisting that he did not mean to imply
``carte blanche support'' to a future coup attempt, the president
added, ``I wouldn't mind force if it could be done in a prudent
manner.''
   Apart from being unclear, the statement was unwise. ...
   But with the widespread opposition of his own people, Noriega
will fall in time. Until then, the only way he can survive
politically is to pose as a nationalist standing up to Yanqui
intervention.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Panama:
   The group of military officers who moved against Gen. Noriega
did not openly ask for help from the United States. Although the
coup leaders wanted covert assistance, they viewed overt U.S.
intervention as embarrassing and damaging.
   They wanted to give the impression, at least, that the coup was
the work of patriotic Panamanians, not of a cadre of officers
carrying out orders from Washington.
   The question that members of Congress should be asking
themselves is whether the American people want military
intervention in Panama. So far the polls indicate that a majority
of Americans approve President Bush's policy of patience and
prudence.

   Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader on reported UFOs in the Soviet
Union:
   (The Soviet news agency) Tass' yarn about a UFO sighting 300
miles southeast of Moscow was interesting _ hoax or not.
   For one thing, the Soviet Union's visiting space creatures
(described as being nine to 12 feet tall and resembling humans, but
with very small heads and three eyes) seem different from those
routinely seen here in America (tall, spindly-legged, ugly
creatures with triangular heads, two eyes, and initials for names,
a la ``E.T.'').
   For another, theirs landed in a park during daylight, while ours
usually land at night near a seldom-traveled road that runs along a
cornfield in Iowa.
   The Soviet sighting is interesting for yet another reason: This
is apparently a first in that country _ which as recently as 10
years ago used to label our UFO sightings as a capitalist trick or
device.
   See, Ivan, we told you so!

   Rain-swollen rivers and creeks in Kentucky
and West Virginia surged over their banks, damaging homes,
stranding children at a school and leaving roads covered with mud
and logs today.
   Miners in West Virginia rescued three employees of the company
they have been striking for 2{ months after a van carrying the
workers slid into a swollen creek, West Virginia State Police said
today.
   Forecasters predicted more showers today in the region following
a storm from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry, which dumped up to a
half-foot of rain.
   Mike Callahan, National Weather Service hydrologist for
Kentucky, said the heavy rain was ``pretty much over with,'' though
some light rain may fall in the next couple of days.
   ``I'm sure every small creek in southeastern Kentucky went out
of its banks, way out of its banks,'' Callahan said.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson ordered the state Division of Disaster
and Emergency SErvices to help communities needing assistance.
Authorities said Clay, Leslie and Pike counties requested help.
   ``We are placing our personnel on the highest levels of alert,''
said James H. Molloy, the agency's executive director. ``It looks
as though the weather system will threaten again Thursday, so this
isn't over yet by any means.''
   Dozens of families were evacuated Tuesday in Pike, Floyd, Clay,
Letcher and Jackson counties. Hundreds of students were sent home
early in both states, and classes in several communities were
canceled today.
   More than 760 students and faculty at McDowell Elementary and
High School were temporarily stranded at the school after the
Frasure and Left Beaver creeks rapidly spilled over their banks
Tuesday morning; water 3 feet deep spilled into one of the
buildings.
   School officials decided it was safer to keep students at the
school rather than attempt to run buses across the flooded creeks.
But parents, angry with the decision, drove their cars and trucks
across the rain-swollen creek or waded in the waist-high water to
retrieve their children.
   By midmorning, the creeks began to recede and buses were taking
children home where the roads were accessible, officials said.
   The full extent of damage was unknown because high water
prevented emergency workers and survey crews from traveling to the
hardest-hit areas.
   Near Dehue, W.Va., three employees of Con-Serv Inc., a non-union
company operating a coal tipple for the A.T. Massey Coal Co., were
in a van that slid 85 feet down a hillside into Rum Creek and
flipped, and about 10 United Mine Workers on strike against Massey
went to their rescue, Trooper Ric Robinson.
   One man was trapped in the van and pickets held his head above
rising water while waiting for emergency workers, said State Police
Sgt. G.A. Ables.
   ``Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' Ables
said. ``He could not have extricated himself from that vehicle
himself.''
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton ordered transportation crews
into hard-hit areas around Matewan to help with the cleanup.
   Steady showers early Tuesday flooded scores of southern West
Virginia streams, ranging from roadside ditches to the Tug Fork and
Guyandotte rivers. The worst damage appeared to be in Matewan, a
town of about 800 people in the southwestern part of the state.
Officials said 150 homes there were evacuated, but residents were
allowed to return to their homes shortly before midnight.
   Flood walls in Williamson and West Williamson protected the
cities from damage. In Matewan, floodwaters inundated a service
station.
   ``It came up the quickest I've ever seen it,'' said Donald
Daugherty, a mail carrier from McCarr, Ky., across the river from
Matewan. ``There wasn't any warning at all.''
   As the floodwaters flowed northward, a steady stream of garbage
flowed toward the Ohio River. Floating milk jugs, bleach bottles
and tree limbs collected along the river's edge.
   The Tug Fork crested at Matewan 6 feet above flood stage at 7
p.m. Forecasters predicted the Tug would crest at Williamson early
today at 3 feet above flood stage.
   Flood-swollen creeks prompted officials to send students home
early on Tuesday in Raleigh, Fayette, McDowell and Logan counties,
authorities said.
   In Boone County, a house along the river was washed away by high
waters and later hit a bridge and disintegrated, state police
spokesman Ric Robinson said. Pax Mayor Charlie Moore said Paint
Creek flooded several homes in his southwestern West Virginia town.
   In Kentucky, several homes in the Big Creek and Elk Creek area
suffered flood damage, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Egon Krenz, who cautiously fashioned his career by
closely following Erich Honecker, has replaced his mentor as the
new East German leader.
   The state-run news agency ADN announced today that the
52-year-old Krenz would succeed Honecker as head of the Communist
Party and head of state. Honecker had come under increasing fire at
home as opposition mounts and a refugee exodus continues.
   Krenz is by far the youngest official on the 21-member Politburo
dominated by aging Communists, many of them in their 70s. But he
has a reputation for following Honecker's hard-line stance.
   A burly, bushy-haired man, Krenz for long has been plagued by
rumors he was an alcoholic, although there has been virtually
nothing to substantiate that.
   He is known for his spontaneous visits to local bars and
restaurants that are the bane of his bodyguards.
   Krenz was born the son of a tailor in Kolberg, a coastal town in
what is now northwestern Poland, on March 19, 1937.
   He joined the FDJ Communist youth organization in 1953, while he
was still in high school and East Germany was only four years old.
   Krenz studied to be a teacher, but joined the East German army
and rose to the rank of lieutenant before being discharged in 1959.
   After studying in Moscow from 1964 to 1967, Krenz returned to
become a leading official of the Communist youth organization in
East Germany.
   He has been a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee
since 1973 and joined the ruling Politburo 10 years later.
   In recent years, he has been in charge of the Communist youth
organizations and internal security officials, while many
acknowledged he was being groomed to take over from Honecker.
   Krenz lives in a heavily guarded compound reserved for
high-ranking Communist Party officials at Lake Wandlitz, about nine
miles north of Berlin.''
   He has long mirrored Honecker's line on various issues, for
example, repeating the long-held assertion that the allegedly
``imperialist'' West poses a threat to Communist East Germany.
   West Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper, in a profile on Oct.
8, said that Krenz is married and has two children.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with amendments including change

powers; picks up 3rd graf pvs: One amendment...</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today overwhelmingly
approved constitutional amendments that are to transform Communist
Hungary into a multi-party democracy.
   Among the 94 changes passed by the 380-member Parliament were
amendments eliminating all references to the leading role of the
newly dissolved Communist Party. Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar
said they effectively end one-party rule in the East bloc nation.
   The country's formal name also was changed from People's
Republic of Hungary to Republic of Hungary to reflect a break with
the Communist past.
   Another change in the 1949 Constitution abolishes the 21-person
collective presidency and replaces it with the office of the
president.
   The powers of president, who also is commander-in-chief of the
armed forces and wields other authority, will be temporarily
assumed by Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueros until democratic
elections are held next year.
   One amendment states that ``political parties may be freely
established and may freely function providing that they respect the
Constitution and the laws.''
   Another declares that the ``leading role of the Marxist-Leninist
party of the working class ... has been outdated. Instead the
necessary legal framework of a multi-party system must be stated.''
   The historic voting came on the heels of another landmark
decision _ the dissolution last week of the Communist Party and its
replacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party.
   Unlike its monolithic, Marxist-Leninist predecessor, the new
party created last week professes commitment to multi-party
democracy and market forces in the economy.
   The moves are the latest in Hungary's dizzying moves in the past
year to break with its socialist past by establishing democratic
economic and social reforms and improve ties to the West. Like
Poland, Hungary's rush to reform has created friction with
hard-line Warsaw Pact allies.
   One-party rule continues at least temporarily, despite
termination of the Communist Party. Its successor continues to
dominate politics pending the nation's first national multi-party
elections in 41 years.
   Today's session also revealed differences on a key aspect of the
country's democratic strivings _ when and how to choose the
nation's president.
   The government wants the election this year but opposition
parties seek a postponement, asserting they have no time or
resources to organize against Socialist Party candidate Imre
Pozsgay.
   The opposition League of Free Democrats called for a plebiscite
on a postponement and they want Parliament to elect the president
after a new legislature is chosen.
   Legislators today overwhelmingly approved a suggestion by
Premier Miklos Nemeth that Parliament should not put the referendum
issue to the vote, but that separate committees deal with the topic
later.
   Parliamentary elections to be scheduled by June would be the
first instance of free multi-party voting on the national level
since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.

<HEAD>California Quake Drives Up Some Insurance Stocks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with stocks affected by earthquake, overall
market conditions; EDITS to tighten and conform. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

   The California earthquake registered only mildly
this morning on the nation's stock exchanges.
   Stocks of companies in San Francisco and Silicon Valley were
mixed, with some, such as Apple Computer Inc., higher. Many
insurance stocks also rose, apparently on speculation the quake
would provide an opportunity for companies to raise rates.
   The overall stock market opened lower after chaotic trading that
began with Friday's 190-point plunge in the 30 blue-chip stocks
that make up the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow was up 2.66
points at 2,641.39 at mid-morning today. The number of advancing
issues slightly outpaced decliners on the Big Board.
   The deadly earthquake Tuesday night in the San Francisco area
raised concerns about the extent of insurance companies'
liabilities, which could weigh down those stocks. Technology
companies with operations in California also could encounter some
selling.
   Meanwhile, new evidence of weakening economic activity raised
speculation that a significant slowdown might be a serious drag on
corporate profits.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department said housing
construction fell 5.2 percent in September to the lowest level
since the 1982 recession.
   The strongest performers among insurance stocks were the
so-called reinsurers that absorb risk from policy-writing firms.
General Re Corp. was up $4.12{ at $87.87{ and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.
was up $3.50 a share at $76.25.
   Among insurers, stocks rebounded quickly after a selloff
triggered by the earthquake, whyich killed more than 250 people.
Some analysts said the quake could produce more than $1 billion in
claims but that the quake losses, coupled with losses from
Hurricane Hugo, could trigger a round of rate increases that would
help the industry's profitability.
   Hardest hit on the stock market was Everex Systems Inc., a maker
of personal computer equipment based in Fremont, Calif., on the
east side of San Francisco Bay. It was off 20 percent, falling
$2.37{ to $9.25.
   Pacific Gas and Electric, the big San Francisco-based utility,
was down 37{ cents a share at $19.62{. Chevron Corp., which has
headquarters in San Francisco, was off 12{ cents at $63.87{. Apple
was up 50 cents at $47.75 a share.
   Before the California disaster, markets around the world had
been stabilizing after the tumultuous period that started with
Friday's plunge in the Dow.
   Stocks lost little ground Tuesday in spite of continued
uncertainty surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL Corp. and a
government report showing a bigger-than-expected trade deficit in
August. The Federal Reserve helped by adding a modest amount of
reserves to the banking system.
   The earthquake caused some nervousness on foreign stock markets
today. In London, dealers said they expected the disaster to affect
trading on Wall Street, and the quake was blamed for declines on
the Australian and New Zealand markets.
   Prices opened higher on the London exchange, but analysts said
fears of a further slump had not dissipated. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 14.0 points, or 0.7
percent, at 2,149.5 when trading began.
   Dealers said the quake did not affect trading in Tokyo but said
if it did affect Wall Street, the fallout could hit Tokyo on
Thursday.
   In Tokyo, stocks posted moderate gains today, with the 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average gaining 111.48 points, or 0.32 percent, to
close at 35,107.56.
   The Federal Reserve pumped $1.5 billion into the banking system
to make sure banks had enough reserves for emergency loans to any
traders who lost big in the market's gyrations. It had injected $2
billion in reserves Monday.

<TEXT>
   One of the two British companies still making hard
toilet paper abandoned production of it Wednesday with a ceremonial
final flush down an 1890 toilet at London's Science Museum.
   ``Today's consumers simply prefer a softer option,'' said David
Driver de Valle, general marketing manager of British Tissues.
   The company decided to do away with its hard toilet paper, known
as Bronco, after a major customer, British Rail, switched to softer
tissues for train bathrooms last year.
   Ron Day, former managing director of Bronco, carried out the
final flushing of the last sheet of paper at the Science Museum.
Another brand of hard toilet paper, Izal, is still available.
   Soft tissue arrived from the United States in the 1930s but
wartime rationing halted imports to Britain, so the rougher brands
survived. But customers over the years began opting for the softer
tissue.
   De Valle said the brand name Bronco will survive, but he refused
to reveal details of the new product. ``We couldn't let a name as
famous as Bronco die out after 100 years,'' he said.

   Princess Gina of Liechtenstein, wife
of the head of state of Liechtenstein, died Wednesday, six days
before her 68th birthday, the government announced.
   The popular Austrian-born princess had been hospitalized since
last month for treatment of an undisclosed illness. A government
communique said her condition suddenly worsened late Tuesday and
she died Wednesday morning.
   ``Her family was with her when she passed away peacefully
shortly after receiving the last sacraments,'' the communique said.
   She is survived by her 83-year-old husband, Franz Josef II, the
world's longest ruling head of state.
   They married in 1943, five years after Franz Josef II took
office as the 12th ruling prince of Liechtenstein, a tiny
principality between Austria and Switzerland. It has become one of
the world's wealthiest countries.
   In 1984, Franz Josef II turned over the running of the country
to his son, Hans Adam, oldest of their five children, but he
remained head of state.
   Princess Gina was president of the Liechtenstein Red Cross and
active in many other charities. The government proclaimed a week of
official mourning. Funeral services were scheduled Oct. 24.

   A Soviet artist appealed to the United
Nations for refugee status Wednesday after the U.S. Embassy
rejected his bid to defect.
   Daoud Alyev, of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, asked the
Cairo office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to put him
under its protection.
   The agency's representative, Abdel-Mawla el-Solh, said the case
would be examined to decide whether Alyev is eligible. Under the
1949 Geneva Convention on Refugees, a person qualifies for asylum
if he is in peril of political or religious persecution at home.
   Alyev, 45, dropped out of a tour group visiting Egypt last week.
He first asked the Turkish Embassy for asylum but was rejected. He
went to the U.S. Embassy on Sunday with a note that said: ``I am a
Soviet citizen. I want to defect to the United States. I speak only
Russian.''
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba confirmed Tuesday that
Alyev had requested to defect and had been referred to the United
Nations.
   Alyev said he defected because he did not have enough artistic
freedom in the Soviet Union. He also said political turmoil in his
republic is stifling his creativity.
   Azerbaijan is involved in a long-running dispute with the
neighboring republic of Armenia over a piece of land known as
Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave is in the republic of Azerbaijan, but
most of its residents are Armenians, and Armenia is fighting to
annex it.

   Parliament has lifted a 4-month-old ban
prohibiting Kenya's leading newspaper chain from reporting on the
legislative body because it said the newspaper group had reformed
its editorial policies.
   Parliament banned the Nation Group of newspapers from
parliamentary reporting June 28, claiming it was anti-government

   On Tuesday, members of Parliament said they believed the
newspaper group had instituted sufficient reforms and should be
allowed to return to reporting on the legislature.
   Immediately after the ban was lifted, Nation Group reporters
resumed their seats in the press gallery.
   The group includes three Swahili-language newspapers and two
English-language newspapers, including Kenya's most popular
newspaper, the Daily Nation, which claims a daily readership of
about 250,000 people.

   Only about one in five California
homeowners has earthquake insurance because of its high cost, but
insurers today said they expect more than $1 billion in claims from
Northern California.
   ``The footage from television looks very serious. A quake like
this could wipe out an insurance company,'' said David Crocker,
area manager for Western Insurance Information Service in Tustin.
   ``I think it will be very bad,'' said Michael Hesketh, a
director of the London investment firm Warburg Securities. ``There
are going to be some losses and certainly in excess of the $1
billion figure we had suggested by the industry this morning.''
   Tuesday's quake cut a swath of devastation through the San
Francisco Bay area, destroying buildings and bridges and sparking a
fire that destroyed a square block in San Francisco. More than 270
people were killed and hundreds more were injured.
   The area is more densely populated than the Whittier area of Los
Angeles County that suffered a quake in October 1987 that
registered 5.9 on the Richter scale.
   That means insurers will likely wind up with a bigger bill than
the $350 million paid out for that quake, Crocker said.
   Insurance companies are required to offer quake coverage to
customers buying comprehensive home coverage in San Francisco, but
only about 20 percent of California homeowners have earthquake
insurance, Crocker said.
   Earthquake insurance is expensive and homeowners often face a 10
percent deductible.
   Farmers Insurance Group charges $2 per $1,000 of value for
earthquake coverage, meaning that to insure a $100,000 home an
owner would pay $200 a year, said company spokesman Jeffrey Beyer
in Los Angeles.
   The earthquake comes at a particularly bad time for insurers _
just three weeks after Hurricane Hugo caused about $4 billion in
damage in South Carolina.
   The twin disasters ``will certainly have an impact on the
industry,'' said Pat Mihm, senior vice president for claims at
Transamerica Insurance Group. ``I can't recall anything like this
in the last 15 or 20 years.''
   Early indications were that the damage wouldn't be as bad as the
damage caused by Hugo, said a spokesman for Lloyd's of London who
requested anonymity. He said it would take weeks to assess the
damage in California.
   ``Information suggests that the cost to insurers, quite serious
as it is, might not be too bad,'' he said. ``It's not the big quake
that people have been predicting, but it's bad enough.''

<TEXT>
   Cyprus filed a protest with the U.N.
Security Council on Wednesday over plans to settle ethnic Turks
from Bulgaria in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.
   The protest followed a statement by the Turkish Cypriot leader,
Rauf Denktash, earlier in the week about the settlement of 200
families of ethnic Turks in northern Cyprus.
   Government spokesman Akis Fantis said the protest asks the five
permanent Security Council members _ Britain, China, France, the
Soviet Union, and the United States _ ``to intervene in the
direction of Turkey to end the illegal actions of Denktash.''
   This is the second protest by the Cyprus government to the
Security Council over the settlement of Bulgarian Turks in Cyprus,
which is divided into Turkish and Greek sectors.
   North Cyprus has been under Turkish control since a 1974
invasion that forced the Greek Cypriot population of the region to
flee south.
   About 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moved north from the south, and
Turkey has shifted 35,000-50,000 more settlers from the mainland to
north Cyprus to take over homes and properties of the Greek Cypriot
refugees and strengthen the Turkish presence.
   U.N. resolutions have called for the withdrawal of the Turkish
troops and settlers from north Cyprus and the return of the Greek
Cypriot refugees.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just weeks after Sony Corp.'s controversial
purchase of Columbia Pictures, another Japanese company is spending
big money on an American media giant _ former President Ronald
Reagan.
   Officials of the Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's
largest media conglomerate, say they are spending about $7 million
to bring Reagan and his wife, Nancy, to Japan for nine days
beginning Friday.
   Welcome posters showing pictures of the former first couple dot
subway stations. Advertisements on Fujisankei's television and
radio stations publicize a ``Friendship Concert'' during the visit
that will feature Perry Como and benefit the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library Foundation.
   The company chartered a TWA Boeing 747 to bring Reagan's
20-member party to Tokyo.
   A guest house near Mount Fuji, where the Reagans will stay two
nights, was specially refurbished for them at a price of $140,000.
   Reagan is to use two of the nine days to meet with present and
former Japanese government officials. On Monday, he and Mrs. Reagan
are to attend a lunch given by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko,
and in the afternoon he is to meet with Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu.
   The Reagans also will attend a luncheon given by former prime
ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita, both of whom
served during Reagan's presidency.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Tuesday the
government is considering a $2 million donation to the Reagan
library to be announced during the former president's visit.
   Japan has donated in the past to the libraries of former U.S.
presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford, Watanabe said.
   For the last seven days of his visit, Reagan will be under the
wing of Fujisankei, which owns the Fuji Telecasting Corp., the
newspaper Sankei Shimbun, and Nippon Hoso, Japan's biggest
commercial radio network.
   The conglomerate is known for a combination of conservative
ideology, low-brow programming, and impressive private art

   Fujisankei Chairman Nobutaka Shikanai ``is a great fan of Reagan
and thinks that the Reagan presidency did a lot for U.S.-Japan
relations,'' said a Fujisankei official.
   ``He wants to bring Reagan in and give him a chance to talk to
the Japanese people, and hopefully the visit will help smooth over
some of the problem areas in U.S.-Japan relations.''
   Company officials say Shikanai first invited Reagan to visit
Japan in 1983.
   Accompanying Reagan will be Charles Z. Wick, former director of
the U.S. Information Agency, who helped arrange the visit.
   Also traveling with Reagan will be his chief of staff, Frederick
J. Ryan, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg, and Mrs. Reagan's
hairdresser, Julius Bengtsson.
   Filling up the plane will be about 200 relatives of U.S. armed
forces personnel currently serving in Japan.

   Callers trying to connect with ``Julie,'' a
beautiful bikini-clad blonde portrayed on Johnny Walker scotch
billboards in southern California, are getting a Dr. George, a guy
named Rich or a fax machine.
   The advertisement on more than 60 billboards in the area invites
people to call Julie and gives her telephone number.
   But the ad doesn't include Julie's area code. The sprawling
urban region has five area codes and callers have been trying each
one.
   Callers using the 213 area code can hear Julie say: ``I was just
thinking how much I love athletic men.''
   But calls to the same number in the 805 area code get a
physician who asked that he be identified only as George.
   ``It's a nuisance,'' he said. ``It's irresponsible and it's a
waste of time.''
   A call to the same number with the 714 area code is answered by
the electronic whistles of a facsimile machine.
   An 818 area code call gets a phone company recording saying the
``call cannot be completed as dialed.''
   In the 619 area code, the number reaches the answering machine
of a guy named Rich, who tells callers: ``Thanks a lot and have a
great day.''
   Gannett Outdoor Advertising in Southern California put up the
billboards for Smith-Greenland Advertising of New York City and has
agreed to paint on an area code, said Gannett spokesman Ron
Cipriani.

   Dispatcher Cheryl Ann Heck says the
incoming call to the city's 911 emergency number sounded like it
could be the work of a prankster _ but she wasn't about to take any
chances.
   ``We could hear some clunking and clicking on the phone, and
every once in a while you would hear the tones, like someone was
depressing the push buttons,'' she said.
   She traced the call and sent police, medical and fire department
personnel rushing to the address.
   Rescue workers broke into the locked house but found nobody home
except the apparent emergency caller: a 1-year-old basset hound
named Mandy.
   ``We've played back the tape several times,'' Ms. Heck said.
``Once you know it's a dog, you can hear it gnawing on the phone
and running down a hallway.''
   Jim Jermain, manager of product marketing for Wisconsin Bell,
said the dog apparently had been carrying and chewing on a cordless
phone.
   ``It appears that with some cordless phones, as the battery gets
low, they send out clicking sounds that are interpreted by our
electronic switcher as a 911 call,'' he said.
   Lisa Booz, Mandy's owner, said she was gone only about 45
minutes to take her cat to the veterinarian about five blocks away.
   ``By the time I got home, all the trucks were gone. My neighbors
told me what happened,'' she said, adding that she called
authorities to apologize.

   Crews worked non-stop today to extricate
motorists from twisted metal and concrete that was an elevated
highway before a devastating earthquake. Officials fear more than
250 people died in the collapse.
   Teams of police and firefighters spent the night after Tuesday
evening's quake searching with dogs for any survivors, said police
Lt. Sidney Rice.
   Shortly before dawn, a hook-and-ladder truck moved alongside the
Nimitz Freeway, which had been a section of Interstate 880. It
stopped periodically to let firefighters shine lights into gaps.
There was no word of any survivors.
   ``We have made an exhaustive search to make sure no people are
still alive. To the best of our knowledge now, there are not any
people still alive on this freeway,'' Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson
said today.
   Screams and the crash of metal brought bystanders to the scene
on Tuesday.
   George Donovan, a Berkeley truck driver, was on the upper deck
in a tractor-trailer rig when the quake hit.
   ``The pavement started to move. I had waves of asphalt come up
over my windshield,'' he said. ``It was undulating all around me.
It was like a Disney ride.''
   Police said 56 bodies had been taken to a makeshift morgue near
the scene, and seven other bodies had been taken to the coroner's
office early today.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' Leroy FitzGerald said
after Tuesday's earthquake knocked a mile-long section of the
highway's upper level onto the bottom lanes.
   ``You could hear people screaming for help,'' said FitzGerald,
who works at a nearby auto parts shop.
   Late Tuesday, high on the upper deck of the Nimitz Freeway,
rescuers walked, their flashlights shining in the darkness as they
worked amid the wreckage that became a vast grave for motorists
caught in the collapse.
   When the 18-block stretch of highway caved in, workers from
businesses in the heavy industrial area ran to help, many bringing
tall ladders and forklifts.
   A passerby, Patrick MacIntyre, said rescuers were able to pull
one man alive from a car that was crushed to a height of 18 inches.
   Emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage of an
automobile. The fate of her parents was not known. Late Tuesday,
rescuers worked to save the unidentified girl's brother.
   A three-member surgical team was forced to amputate the right
leg of the 7-year-old boy who was trapped in a car for seven hours.
At 12:15 a.m., he finally was carried down a 20-foot ladder an
taken to an ambulance.
   Darius Brewer, a 26-year-old cook, joined an impromptu rescue
party. The group crawled as far as possible under the crushed road
to help injured motorists. They used crowbars to pry open one auto
and tied ropes around an elderly man to lower him 20 feet to safety.
   ``Then we went on top of the second deck and just mostly got
everybody down we could. People were yelling and screaming,'' he
said. ``Some people were yelling `I'm hurt! I'm hurt!'
   Susan Kato of Alameda was on the road just past the Cypress
Street exit _ the center of the worst-hit span _ when she felt the
rolling. Suddenly, cars within a few dozen feet of her vanished.
   She, along with others, backed off and got off at Cypress.
   ``I could see people alive and screaming. I don't know how
anyone could have survived,'' she said.
   Hundreds of workers tried to pry survivors from a tiny gap left
between the levels.
   ``There's a 1{-foot crawlspace where they're trying to extricate
them,'' Rice said. ``I guess there's 20 cars trapped in there.''
   Parts of the buckled structure resembled a roller coaster, with
huge slabs of concrete skewed at all angles. Chunks of pulverized
concrete littered the streets for blocks, dusting warehouses.
   The thud of helicopter blades mingled with the whine of sirens
from other parts of the earthquake-damaged city.
   Police and emergency vehicles cordoned off the area for at least
a dozen blocks around the highway.
   People stood on street corners trying to get a glimpse of the
disaster, but darkness hid the carnage between the collapsed
sections.
   Victims on stretchers lay in a makeshift medical center on a
floodlit street corner.
   ``Two women died in my arms,'' said an exhausted Robert Majors,
who lives a block from the freeway. ``There was a man who died with
all of us watching. There was nothing we could do. He was stuck
under the concrete. ... There was a fire. There was nothing we
could do.''

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo appealed to
Congress today for patience in meeting U.S. demands for the opening
of markets in his country to more American meat and other farm
products.
   Roh told a joint meeting of the House and Senate all U.S.-South
Korean trade issues eventually will be ``resolved to mutual
satisfaction.''
   ``But only with the passage of time, can Korea ultimately adjust
and achieve openness in the agricultural market without causing
political and social trauma,'' he said.
   Roh told the lawmakers his people want the same things as
Americans ask from their legislators: to protect workers and save
jobs. And since ``nearly 20 percent of all Koreans work on small,
traditional family farms ... our efforts to expand agricultural
imports have important political and social consequemnces for
nearly one-fifth of our population,'' he added.
   South Korea is already second to Japan as the largest overseas
customer for U.S. farm products. As in Japan, the political power
of its rural sector has slowed opening of its market to food
imports behind that of other products.
   Roh's aides said an agricultural trade liberalization program
being launched next year would reduce import controls from the
current level of 30 percent to 15 percent by 1991.
   On another topic, Roh said the vast majority of South Koreans
support supports the presence of the 43,000 U.S. troops in their
country, and anti-American demonstrators represent only a ``tiny
band of extremists.''
   Roh, who spoke in English, began by expressing ``the deep
sympathy of the Korean people'' to Americans ``who are suffering a
national disaster'' in the earthquake-stricken San Francisco Bay
area of California.
   Applauded frequently, Roh used his speech to renew a proposal he
made a year ago at the U.N. General Assembly to convene a meeting
of Northeast Asian countries to discuss ``how to lay a solid
foundation for leasting peace and properity in the area.''
   Referring to unnamed dissidents, Roh said, ``Regrettably,
certain radicals have resorted to force and committed unlawful acts
to pursue their aims under the guise of democratic reform ... here
are also the tiny band of extremists who parade anti-American
slogans and perpetrate attacks on U.S. facilities.''
   In the latest such incident, six militant students invaded an
vandalized the U.S. ambassador's residence in Seoul last week.
   Roh said his own party and the political opposition are united
in backing the American military presence that he and President
Bush agreed in talks Tuesday continues to be vital for deterring
attack by communist North Korea.
   In the population as a whole, he said ``a very recent poll has
shown that 94 percent strongly support the presence of U.S.
troops.''
   ``Any hint of weakening in the U.S. defense commitment or
(sudden) lessening of the U.S. military presence might cause North
Korea to misjudge the U.S. commitment,'' he said.
   Roh said his government is ``exerting every possible effort to
... convince North Korea that nothing will be achieved by force.''
He voiced hope that South Korea's expanding relations with the
Soviet Union, China and other communist countries would help ease
North Korean hostility.
   Roh was the second Korean president in history to address
Congress. The first was Syngman Rhee, founder of the Republic of
Korea, who in 1954 thanked the American people for saving his
country from communism in the 1950-53 Korean war.
   Roh recalled that he fought beside Americans not only in Korea
but also Vietnam, where, he said, some of the U.S. senators and
representatives in his audience also served.
   South Korea ``has emerged from the authoritarianism of the past
... democracy has already become an unstoppable force which no one
can divert,'' said Roh, who became president after a surprise
decision accepting opposition demands for a popular election that
he ultimately won.
   Changes in his country, he said, ``are so diverse, rapid and
far-reaching that they can be truly be called revolutionary.''
   He made no mention of his nation's Internal Security Act that
human rights organizations claim has been misued by his government
to arrest 2,000 dissidents since Roh took office in February 1988.
   Later, in a speech to the National Press Club, Roh said today's
demonstrations in Korea differ from mass rallies of 1987 ``waged
mostly to demand democratization.''
   Today, he said, ``our fledgling democracy is challenged by the
small radical fringe ... extremists (who) have by their
inflammatory words and violent actions clearly revealed themselves
to be enemies of democracy intent on subverting our system, and
bringing about a class revolution ...
   ``They do not hesitate to firebomb or seize government buildings
and foreign diplomatic installations,'' he said, adding that public
opinion condemns such radicals.
   He and his wife were flying to Los Angeles later to greet former
President Reagan and to address the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council on Thursday.

<HEAD>Thatcher Calls Sanctions on South Africa Irresponsible</HEAD>
<UNK>By MAUREEN JOHNSON ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain, waging a lone war on sanctions against South Africa,
told the Commonwealth summit Wednesday the measures were ``utterly
irresponsible,'' officials said.
   Other nations in the 49-member grouping of Britain and its
former colonies, including Canada and host Malaysia, pressed for
continued or stronger embargoes. Proponents said sanctions forced
President F.W. de Klerk to promise reforms and release black
nationalist leaders.
   The exchanges on the weeklong summit's opening day heralded a
new confrontation over South Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in
1961.
   ``We are much more likely to achieve our aim by giving
encouragement than by trying to behave as if nothing significant
has happened,'' Mrs. Thatcher told a closed session of the summit.
Her comments were reported by a British official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He quoted her as saying de Klerk took a ``major step forward''
by releasing eight black leaders this week, allowing peaceful
demonstrations and being prepared to consult ``all shades of
opinion.''
   Britain, a major trading partner of South Africa, argues that
sanctions hurt blacks and increase white resistance to change.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia said sanctions
``must not only continue but must be escalated'' to force an end to
apartheid, the official policy of racial segregation that allows
South Africa's 5 million whites to maintain control over 28 million
blacks.
   ``Sanctions work,'' Mahathir declared. ``Concern for the effect
of sanctions on the blacks is misplaced. ... Investments and
financial flows to racist South Africa must be completely stopped.''
   In a blunt opening address, he also blamed industrialized
countries for pollution and accused them of ``manipulating'' the
world economy.
   ``It is the developed countries which have most assailed our
environment,'' he said. ``Nuclear testing, excessive use of fossil
fuels, private transportation, release of CFC into the atmosphere,
massive wastage of paper, toxic chemical disposal _ all these and
more are the direct result of the lifestyle of the rich.''
   Mahathir said rich nations have ``ganged up against the poor.
They have arrogated to themselves the right to direct world trade
and to manipulate currencies to their advantage.''
   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, titular head of the Commonwealth,
acknowledged Wednesday night that the organization has ``family
disagreements.''
   ``Like all the best families, we have our share of
eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of
disagreements,'' she told the heads of government at a banquet on
the royal yacht Britannia, but added: ``You have shown that it is
possible to make advances even on the most difficult problems.''
   Canada wants the Commonwealth to maintain current embargoes on
South Africa and oppose rescheduling of the foreign debt. But it
also supports holding off on any new punitive measures for six
months to give de Klerk an opportunity for reform.
   Debate on the issue was scheduled for Thursday.

   Federal officials moved quickly today to
assess the damage from Tuesday's disastrous California earthquake
and speed aid to the region as President Bush declared, ``The
machinery is working.''
   The president, whose administration's response to Hurricane Hugo
last month was criticized by some lawmakers as slow and
bureaucratic, signed a declaration triggering a flow of federal
financial aid to the quake-stricken San Francisco Bay area.
   Bush then went to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and met with officials for about 25 minutes. On
his way out, he told reporters: ``What I have seen is a highly
coordinated, effective federal effort.''
   ``In the sense that if there's anything good, it's that the
agency is well-prepared ...,'' he said. ``The machinery is
working.''
   He said officials were continuing to assess the damage estimates.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is $273
million in unallocated funds from a $1.1 billion appropriation for
the Hurricane Hugo cleanup ``which can be used for immediate
assistance in San Francisco.''
   ``That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the
emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider
appropriate requests for follow-on funding,'' said the presidential
spokesman.
   Asked whether the federal response to the earthquake will be
faster than it was to Hugo, Bush said, ``I hope there will be less
carping ... I think they took a hit on that.''
   ``I guess you can never avoid all criticism. FEMA then responded
very promptly and they're responding very, very promptly now,'' he
said.
   FEMA has an emergency fund that can be used for a variety of
purposes, including hotel accomodations for homeless people and as
much as $10,000 per family for recovery assistance, said the
agency's associate director, Grant Peterson.
   Shortly after the quake occurred, FEMA set up a disaster field
office in The Presidio, an Army post in San Francisco, headed by
regional director Robert Vickers.
   Peterson said about 100 FEMA employees were on the scene,
coordinating with state energency workers, and the agency has told
its staff in areas as far away as Seattle, Wash., to remain on
alert indefinitely.
   Peterson said the agency was making a concerted effort to avoid
the kind of criticism it faced after Hurricane Hugo devastated
South Carolina last month.
   During that emergency, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. referred to
the agency as ``a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses'' for its alleged
slowness in responding to to needs of victims.
   This time, Peterson said, FEMA is taking steps to fully inform
the news media about its actions and avoid misunderstandings.
`We're not waiting to respond, we're responding right now,'' he
said Tuesday night.
   Peterson said the agency had found itself severely strained in
South Carolina because Hugo already had hit the U.S. Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico.
   In California, disaster officials had been preparng for years
for an expected major earthquake by holding dress reheasrsals.
   Peterson said the agency has a $1.18 billion pool that was set
up to deal with damage from Hurricane Hugo last month, and some of
that money can be used to help victims of the earthquake.
   The agency's first action was to shuffle officials from one
place to another to be in position to respond quickly to requests
when they come in from California. For example, FEMA officials were
being flown from Denton, Texas, to Sacramento to help with the
paperwork, Peterson said.
   After Hugo swept across the Virgin Islands, a FEMA official said
no aid was being sent right away because the territory's governor
had not asked for it. The official acknowledged at the time that
one reason the request may have been slow in coming was that the
hurricane knocked out telephone lines.
   ``There's not going to be a problem with California asking the
right questions,'' Peterson said Tuesday night.

   A senior HUD official has decided a real estate
partnership that includes a former lawyer of President Reagan must
repay $700,000 in government grant money, a published report said.
   The decision by C. Austin Fitts, the newly confirmed assistant
secretary for housing at HUD, reversed an earlier judgment by a
ranking official of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   HUD investigators say federal funds were spent inappropriately
and that the partners, including Washington lawyer Edward
Weidenfeld, failed to invest sufficiently from their own funds in
the federally subsidized housing project in Brunswick, Ga.
   Part of the $700,000 that Weidenfeld and his two partners must
repay will go to the government, and the remainder will be
reinvested in the Cypress Mill Plantation apartment complex.
   The chief HUD housing official in Atlanta, Neil Zittrauer, said
he understood the partners invested as little as $100 in the
complex, which received mortgage assistance from two HUD programs.
   ``It was a very negligible investment on their part,'' Zittrauer
said.
   In the earlier ruling, HUD deputy assistant secretary R. Hunter
Cushing, overrode regional housing officials in Atlanta and said
the partnership should repay only $88,000. Cushing resigned earlier
this year and since has become a focus of congressional
investigations into political abuses at HUD.
   Weidenfeld was deputy general counsel and later general counsel
in Reagan's 1980 campaign. He was chairman of the legal advisory
committee to the 1984 campaign committee.

   A state legislator has organized a
letter-writing compaign protesting an upcoming university
performance of a play about AIDS among gay men.
   Marshall Gordon, president of Southwest Missouri State
University, said Tuesday he believes the play is protected under
the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of expression and
should not be stopped.
   State Rep. Jean Dixon has written other lawmakers urging them to
contact the university to ask for cancellation of the November
production of the play, ``The Normal Heart'' by New York author and
gay rights activist Larry Kramer. She said she found the language
and theme obscene and offensive.
   ``It is a homosexual political agenda,'' Ms. Dixon said of the
play. ``They're doing nothing but propagating it with taxpayers'
dollars.''
   Robert Bradley, head of the school's theater and dance
department, said the play did not promote homosexuality. He said it
might expose students to knowledge of the dangers of unsafe sex.

   East German leader Erich Honecker was stripped of
power today, ending 18 years of iron-fisted rule as the government
grapples ith growing public demands for a freer society.
   State news media said the Communist Party hierarchy replaced its
77-year-old leader with Egon Krenz, a Honecker protege and the
youngest member of the ruling Politburo.
   Honecker, who directed the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961,
also will be relieved of his largely ceremonial post as head of
state and as chief of the military, the government-run news agency
ADN said.
   ADN said Krenz, 52, in charge of security issues and
government-run youth groups, already had taken over as the party
chief and would be recommended for the posts as military chief and
head of state.
   The latter two require the approval of the nation's Parliament,
and that is guaranteed by the strong central control of the
government.
   Krenz, like Honecker, is considered a Communist hard-liner.
However, he signaled a softer stance when he reportedly urged
police to stop their harsh crackdown on the thousands of people who
have been staging protests in recent weeks.
   West Germany's ARD television network carried a brief interview
Krenz gave to East German television immediately after his
appointment in which the new leader referred to the national
situation as a ``very complicated time.''
   ``I told the Central Committee that I realize this is a
difficult task that I have taken over,'' said Krenz, smiling and
appearing congenial. ``In this very complicated time there is much
work before us.''
   Two other key members of the ruling Politburo lost their
positions.
   Politburo member Joachim Herrmann, 60, who was in charge of the
nation's media, and Guenter Mittag, 63, the architect of East
Germany's economic policy, ``were relieved of their functions,''
ADN reported.
   ADN said both men had also lost their posts on the Communist
Party's 163-member Central Committee and 21-member Politburo, and
Mittag will be relieved of his duties as deputy head of state.
   The move was an apparent attempt to placate growing public
demands for a freer press and economic reforms.
   The change in leadership comes as East Germany is still reeling
from the exodus in recent months of tens of thousands of its
citizens seeking better wages and more freedoms in the West. The
flight has been followed by public dissent unprecedented under in
this Communist country.
   In Washington, President Bush said Krenz' rise to power was
unlikely to signal fundamental change.
   ``Whether that reflects a change in East-West relations, I don't
think so,'' he said. ``Mr. Krentz has been very much in accord with
the policies of Honecker. So it's too early to say.''
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the
leadership change and said he hoped Krenz would ``make the way
free'' for a better life for East Germans.
   ``We hope that in the interest of our countrymen that the reform
process that has been so sympathetically received in Poland and
Hungary and also in the Soviet Union will finally get its chance in
East Germany as well,'' Kohl told reporters.
   ADN said that Honecker asked to be relieved of his official
duties for ``health reasons.'' Honecker has reportedly been in ill
healh following a gall bladder operation in August.
   But Honecker had been under pressure to resign after a wave of
protests swept the country.
   His ouster came after the Politburo began meeting on Tuesday.
That meeting was followed today by a gathering of the Central
Committee of the party, which must approve Politburo decisions.
   Krenz has long been rumored to be the choice to succeed Honecker
and holds many of his hard-line views.
   However, Communist Party sources also said it was Krenz'
decision to ask police to stop attacking demonstrators after
authorities charged protesters and brutally beat them earlier this
month in East Berlin and Dresden.
   Since early October, tens of thousands of people fed up with the
tightly controlled society have taken to the streets to demand
reforms including free elections and a free press.
   The widespread discontent and an exodus to the West this year of
more than 123,000 people _ mostly young, skilled workers _ has
forced the government to express a willingness for dialogue, though
it has made it clear that the Communist Party has no intention of
ceding its ``leading role.''
   Honecker has served as party chief since 1971, taking over the
additional post as head of state in 1976. He has guided East
Germany to the position as the most economically successful member
of the Soviet bloc.
   Honecker was born Aug. 25, 1912 in Saarland, in the southwestern
corner of what is now West Germany.
   In 1935, Honecker was thrown in prison by the Nazi regime for
his political activities and didn't get out until the invading
Soviet Red Army arrived a decade later.
   He gained his first powerful government posts in 1958, rising to
membership in the Politburo of the East German party and becoming a
Central Committee secretary with responsibility for state security.
   In 1961, then Communist Party chief Walter Ulbricht assigned
Honecker to direct the Soviet-backed construction of the Berlin
Wall to stop the mass flight of the nation's most productive
citizens to the city's Western sector.

   The devastating earthquake that killed
hundreds in northern California vividly recalls the catastrophic
quake and fire that laid waste to San Francisco in 1906.
   Quakes are almost commonplace in California, with that state and
western Nevada experiencing 90 percent of the tremors recorded in
this country according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
   But when the rare major quake comes, as it did in the nation's
second-deadliest quake on Tuesday, serious damage can result as
well as death and injury.
   And while the West Coast feels the earth shake more often,
shocks can strike any part of the nation.
   The new quake registered at 6.9 on the Richter scale and was on
the notorious San Andreas Fault. That reading made it the
sixth-most powerful quake to strike California this century, and
the mos powerful since a 7.0 quake centered in Eureka in 1980.
   Such a quake can cause severe damage, with each increase of one
whole number meaning an increase of 10 times in strength.
   Tuesday's devastating quake still is well short of the 1906 San
Francisco quake, however, which was estimated at 8.3 on the scale.
That disaster killed more than 700 people, largely in fires which
swept the city in the wake of the tremor.
   California and Alaska are subject to many quakes because they
rest on what is called the Ring of Fire, a region of volcanoes and
earthquake-prone lands circling the Pacific Ocean.
   This ring is caused by the movement of the giant plates that
underlie the land and oceans of the earth. Plates move gradually,
stresses build up over time and then are released in quakes.
   San Francisco sits astride the San Andreas fault, a crack in the
earth where the Pacific plate is slowly sliding north compared with
the rest of California, which rests on the North American Plate. It
was the same fault that instigated the 1906 tremor.
   While the 1906 disaster is burned into American memory, this
country has been relatively fortunate, compared to other nations,
in terms of earthquake disasters.
   The 25,000 deaths reported in Armenia a year ago are fresh in
memory, and China had an estimated 650,000 deaths in a violent
quake in 1976. Japan too has suffered many deaths in historic
quakes, as have Iran, Turkey, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile and other
nations.
   The 1906 San Francisco quake was the largest American death
toll, although at least two other events were stronger in terms of
the Richter scale.
   Here is a rundown of other major earthquakes in American history
as recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey:
   _New Madrid, Mo., was shaken by three quakes in 1811-1812
estimated at 8.4 to 8.7 on the Richter scale, but damage and
casualties were light because the region had a relatively small
population at the time. These quakes were felt as far away as
Boston and New York.
   _Prince William Sound, Alaska, was pounded by a quake rated at
8.4 on the Richter scale, on March 27, 1964. In this century only
one quake, in Chile in 1960, has been stronger. There were 131
deaths and extensive damage in Alaska.
   _On Nov. 18, 1867, the Virgin Islands were shaken by a magnitude
7.5 quake also felt in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
Waves as large as 20 feet were generated.
   _In the same area a 7.5 temblor shook the Mona passage near
Puerto Rico on Oct. 11, 1918. Some 116 people died, many in the
giant wave generated by the quake.
   _On Aug. 17, 1959, a quake rated at 7.3 struck Hebgen Lake,
Mont., and was felt from Seattle to North Dakota to Utah. Extensive
damage was reported and 28 people died.
   _Olympia, Wash., was struck by a 7.1 quake on April 13, 1949,
killing eight people and causing extensive damage in Washington and
Oregon.
   _There was a quake rated 7.0 at Borah Peak, Idaho, on Oct. 25,
1983. It was widely felt but only two people were killed.
   _Coalinga, Calif., was the focus of a 6.7 magnitude quake on May
2, 1983, injuring 45 people and causing $31 million in damage.
   _On Aug. 31, 1886 Charleston, S.C., suffered a 6.6 magnitude
quake killing 60 people. This tremor was felt as far away as
Boston, Milwaukee and Havana, Cuba.
   _A quake measured at 6.6 also did severe damage to the San
Fernando Valley of California on Feb. 9, 1971, killing 65 people.

   President Bush said today the turnover in East
Germany's government may not lead to improvements in East-West
relations, but his administration challenged the new party
leadership to make an effort in that direction.
   Bush told reporters he was following with interest the
replacement of Erich Honecker as East Germany's leader with
Politburo member Egon Krenz.
   But, he told reporters, ``whether that reflects a change in
East-West relations, I don't think so. I don't think it does.
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of
Honecker. So it's too early to say.''
   At the same time, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:
``We hope this change signals movement by the (East German)
leadership toward reforms and responds to the hopes and aspirations
of its people.''
   ``The United States is prepared to develop stronger and more
constructive relations with (East Germany). It is up to the new
leadership there to demonstrate through its deeds that it's ready
to move in that direction,'' Fitzwater said.
   Honecker, 77, was removed as party leaders met to discuss the
flight of East Germans to the West and growing pro-democracy
protests.
   The state-run news service, ADN, reported that Krenz, 52, in
charge of security issues as well as government-run youth groups,
had taken over as the party chief.
   Bush was asked about the government turnover by reporters as he
met with congressional leaders to discuss the San Francisco
earthquake and other issues.
   ``There's dynamic change taking place in Eastern Europe and now,
it appears, the GDR (East Germmany). But whether this step is a
step toward more openness, I think it's way too early to say,''
Bush said.
   ``There's nothing in the record to indicate it is,'' he added.
   Privately, administration officials expressed guarded optimism
that the change might spell movement on the part of East Germany
toward more political openness.
   ``We've been closely following events in East Germany. There's
been a lot of activity and there's an obvious connection between
Honecker's departure and recent events,'' said an administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonyity.
   As to whether the administration would use the changes to make
new overtures toward the East German government, the official said,
``we'll have to see.''

   Pacific Bell officials said today their
telephone network survived Tuesday's devastating Northern
California earthquake without significant damage, but the system
was being overloaded by a huge increase in calls into and out of
the San Francisco area.
   Because of the surge in long-distance calls to the region, many
calls were being blocked. Recorded messages told callers to try
again later.
   The local network around San Francisco was unscathed, but
because of the big increase in calls, callers were having
difficulty connecting with the network, said Mary Hallisey, a
Washington spokeswoman for Pacific Bell's parent, the Pacific
Telesis Group.
   ``The local network is in fine shape,'' Hallisey said. ``There
is no damage to the central offices or the network itself. It is
operating. There is a gridlock problem based on the fact that so
many people are trying to call in all at once. ... When you pick up
the phone out there you don't get a dial tone right away. ... The
system is not out, it's just a very slow dial tone.
   ``You've got customers trying to get ahold of friends, loved
ones, work,'' said Sue Galloway, district manager for Pacific
Bell's network in Southern California.
   ``It's extremely heavy, and my anticipation is it will get
heavier as the day goes one,'' Galloway said by telephone from Los
Angeles.
   ``We're asking people not to call in for a 24-hour period,''
said Lissa Zanville, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which handles about 70
percent of the nation's long-distance calls, appealed to people not
to try telephoning the earthquake area.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was blocking part of
a flood of calls into the area so San Franciscans could call out.
   ``Between 2 a.m. (EDT) and 10 a.m. there were 17 million calling
attempts in AT&amp;T's nationwide network. That compared with 13
million long-distance calling attempts during the same 2 a.m to 10
a.m time frame the week before,'' Linnen said.
   He did not know how many calls were placed to the San Francisco
area.
   ``Clearly, we have not seen volumes of this kind in the memories
of veteran network managers, and it is clearly the interest in and
concern for the San Francisco Bay situation.
   ``We are urging people elsewhere to not call into that area so
we can devote more of our circuits to what we're trying to do _
give priority to calls coming out of that affected area,'' he said,
and this request will apply until further notice.

   Cuba was elected today to the Security
Council for the first time since its revolution 30 years ago.
   Diplomats said Cuba's election was a sign of increasing
respectability and importance for the communist nation still
shunned by the U.S. government and subjected to a trade embargo.
   The U.S. government, which did not openly oppose Cuba's seating,
said it hoped the Havana government would act constructively on the
council. It called on Cuba to respect the Central American peace
accords and not to interfere with military or covert aid in
regional affairs.
   ``We hope it will recognize that it has a special responsibility
as a member of the Security Council to act constructively to end
regional conflicts, not contribute to them,'' according to a
statement read by a State Department spokesman.
   Washington has accused Cuba of subversion and military
involvement in Latin America as well as in Africa. Cuba, however,
has been withdrawing its troops from Angola as part of an overall
political agreement in Southern Africa.
   The last time Cuba served on the council was in 1956, before its
1959 revolution. The only other time was in 1947.
   Cuba was elected by the General Assembly in a secret ballot,
along with four other non-permanent members of the council serving
two-year terms. Cuba, which replaces Brazil, received the highest
number of votes in the balloting _ 146 out of 156 votes cast.
   The other new members are the Ivory Coast replacing Algeria,
Zaire replacing Senegal, Romania replacing Yugoslavia and
Democratic Yemen replacing Nepal. The other non-permanent members
are Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland and Malaysia.
   The five permanent members are the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union, all of whom hold veto power.
   The election of Cuba and Yemen, another communist nation
critical of the West, were not expected to significantly alter the
balance in the council.
   The Security Council has responsibility for maintaining
international peace and security and its resolutions are considered
binding, although they often are flouted.

   The Pentagon, awaiting a request for aid from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was prepared to offer
whatever support is necessary to aid California earthquake victims,
spokesman Pete Williams said today.
   ``We are awaiting orders from FEMA. We are willing to respond
whenever we hear from them,'' Williams said.
   The Pentagon reported in a mid-day update that damage to
military facilities in the area around San Francisco was
``comparatively minor.''
   Structural damage, power outages, disruption of water supplies
and some broken gas lines were reported.
   Maj. Gen. Todd P. Graham, the deputy commanding general of the
6th Army headquarters at the Presidio in San Francisco, has been
named the disaster control officer on the scene, the Pentagon said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered representatives from the
armed forces to set up an emergency working group to help
coordinate efforts to aid California earthquake victims, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   Cheney asked that the group, formally known as the Directorate
of Military Support, assist and coordinate relief efforts with FEMA.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jim Wood said a pier buckled at the Alameda
Naval Air Station, causing two minor injuries. The 2,616-acre air
station, which serves as a site to overhaul and rebuild planes,
also reported major damage to its runways.
   People injured in the quake were being treated at the Letterman
Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in
Oakland, where 100 beds were made available. Fort Ord, near
Monterey, was providing blood, the Pentagon said.
   In addition, about 20 military police from the Army base at the
Presidio in San Francisco, located near the Golden Gate bridge,
were helping local police to control traffic near the base.
   Naval vessels _ the frigate USS Lang, the replenishment oiler
USS Kansas City and the ammunition ship USS Flint _ were also
providing support. The Lang was moved from the Naval Station at
Treasure Island to help fight fires. The two other ships, which
have helicopter pads on board, were to remain at anchor and offer
their helicopters to give aid where necessary, the Pentagon said.
   The guided missile cruiser USS Gridley was also providing fresh
water and other resources for the Navy's training facilities on
Treasure Island, Wood said.
   The Naval Air Station at Moffet Field, located near Sunnyvale,
Calif., south of San Francisco, was allowing civilian aircraft to
land at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Pentagon statement said.

   The battle over whether the United States
should commemorate an ``Armenian genocide'' is going to the Senate
floor where the Bush administration will try again to defeat the
measure.
   The Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, on an 8-6
vote, approved the measure Tuesday.
   The move angered Turkey, which had waged a full-scale lobbying
campaign to kill the measure in committee. The NATO ally, which
receives about $500 million in U.S. aid a year, sees the resolution
as tantamount to a comparison with Hitler's regime in Germany.
   ``Now we've got to concentrate on 100 people,'' said Mike
McNamara, a lobbyist for Turkey. No date has been set for full
consideration by the Senate.
   Turkey was aided in its campaign by the administration, which
summoned the American ambassador from Ankara to help work against
the measure. Publicly, however, the State Department did not
announce its opposition to the resolution until after the vote.
   ``The bottom line is that we oppose it,'' Roman Popadiuk, a
White House spokesman, said late Tuesday.
   Before the panel passed the measure, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, tried unsuccessfully to soften it by eliminating the word
``genocide.''
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, suggested the
change, Metzenbaum said. He sought to replace the word genocide
with a ``national day of remembrance'' for Armenians.
   ``Whether or not it is a genocide is arguable,'' Metzenbaum
said, discussing the reported deaths of 1.5 million Armenians in
the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923.
   Armenians, the bulk of whom now live within Soviet borders, have
a long history of ethnic and religious conflict with Turks. Turkey
claims hundreds of thousands of people, not 1.5 million, died from
war, famine and epidemics during the war years and that many Turks
were among them.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said, ``The only debate is whether it was attempted genocide or
genocide.'' Moreover, Biden said Turkey's opposition to the
resolution was irrelevant.
   ``The fact that the government of Turkey opposes it is of no
consequence,'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., argued genocide did occur. ``People
were massacred because of their ancestry,'' in the Ottoman Empire,
he said.
   The measure, sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, aroused strong feelings among Americans of Turkish and
Armenian descent.
   ``I became the focal point for the greatest lobbying campaign
I've experience in a long while,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   The Dole measure would set April 24, 1990 to memorialize the 1.5
million Armenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 during the
days of the Ottoman Empire.
   Although the Bush administration opposes it, President Bush
voiced support for language marking the ``Armenian genocide''
during the 1988 campaign.
   The Reagan administration opposed similiar resolutions when they
came before the House in past years. None of those passed.

   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell,
gaining confidence that a constitutional amendment to ban burning
the American flag will be defeated, said Tuesday it is ``tragic''
that President Bush had championed the measure.
   ``The Bill of Rights has never been amended or tampered with in
200 years of our nation's history and now, tragically, the
president of the United States himself ... is leading the effort to
change the Bill of Rights,'' Mitchell, the Senate majority leader
from Maine, told a group of reporters.
   ``Just a minute, I'm just getting warmed up,'' a broadly
grinning Mitchell declared when a reporter tried to ask a question
about an unrelated issue.
   Mitchell said it was ``most unfortunate'' that Bush had
campaigned for the amendment and said the measure sought ``to force
Americans to choose between the flag and the Constitution.''
   ``Americans do revere the flag and they do revere the
Constitution and they can do both,'' Mitchell said.
   The Senate planned to vote on the amendment Thursday morning.
   Critics say it would curb freedom of speech. Proponents call it
the only way to prevent recurrence of the Supreme Court ruling in
June that held existing law against flag burning unconstitutional.
   Bush has been the most visible champion of the measure while
Senate Democrats have provided the bulk of the opposition. But two
former Republican sponsors, Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., dropped their support on Tuesday because of the
measure's impact on the Bill of Rights.
   The House last week approved and sent to Bush's desk a new
approach to ban flag burning by simple statute. It was carefully
worded in an effort to bring it into line with the Supreme Court's
ruling.
   Bush said that he would allow it to become law while continuing
to press for the amendment.
   Growing surer that they would prevail against the amendment,
Democratic senators trooped to the floor to denounce it.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said that Americans ``are not
clamoring at us to amend the Constitution.''

   John E. Frohnmayer, new chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, vowed Wednesday to calm a
congressional uproar over obscenity and to seek greater financial
support for the arts, including a possible appeal to millionaire
rock stars for donations.
   Frohnmayer told reporters he had met twice recently with Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the endowment's harshest critic, and was
assured that Helms had no intention of trying to abolish the
grant-making federal agency.
   At Helms' urging, Congress recently banned federal spending on
materials the endowment chairman determines ``may be considered
obscene'' and lacking in serious artistic, literary, political or
scientific value.
   The ban was prompted by conservative legislators' complaints
that NEA funds were used by contemporary art institutes in
Philadelphia and Winston-Salem, N.C., to support exhibitions of
controversial works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano.
   Frohnmayer said he told Helms that the anti-obscenity law will
be ``terribly difficult to administer'' because of longstanding
differences over what constitutes obscenity and the need to protect
First Amendment guarantees of free speech.
   But Frohnmayer promised to ``keep the lines of communication
open'' with NEA critics and to erase their perception that the
endowment has been arrogant and elitist.
   Frohnmayer said he would seek a significant increase in the
endowment's $171.3 million budget to help bolster arts education in
public schools, expand access to cultural events by minority groups
and underwrite the mounting expenses of high-quality arts
institutions.
   ``But we're not going to get any more money if we don't make our
case,'' he said.
   Frohnmayer, who succeeded Frank Hodsoll as endowment chairman
Oct. 3, said he will seek greater private support for the arts,
including a possible appeal to rock stars and other big-name
performers to donate part of their multimillion-dollar profits to
support arts education.
   The endowment, an independent federal agency, spent $156 million
in tax-paid matching grants last year to underwrite about 800
artists and 3,800 arts institutions, from opera and theater
companies to poets and folk artists.
   The endowment's budget has grown by less than 8 percent since
1981, when President Reagan took office and tried unsuccessfully to
slash its $158.8 million budget in half.

   As the sun rose Wednesday in San Francisco,
residents went to the top of the scenic 900-foot Twin Peaks area to
see the city for themselves.
   What they saw underneath the haze, smog and dust shocked them _
perfect stillness and practically no traffic.
   ``It's so quiet,'' said an awestruck Marianne Wong as she gazed
toward downtown and the Golden Gate Bridge.
   Wong arrived at the Twin Peaks Vista Point _ called the
``natural dividing point of the city'' _ with a friend about 9
a.m., skipping the normal routine of school and work to see the
city firsthand the morning after a catastrophic earthquake rumbled
through a wide area of Northern California.
   The chance to see the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge without
traffic was also what brought Paul Brager to the mountain.
   ``I think we are very lucky it wasn't like the 1906 quake, but I
didn't think a (magnitude) seven would cause this much damage,'' he
said.
   Looking from the vista point toward the Marin headlands, bridges
and city neighborhoods had only light traffic. Above, only the
Goodyear blimp could be seen floating over the city.
   Sirens continually pierced the otherwise quiet morning. Beyond
that, the only noise to be heard came from chirping birds.
   John Brown and Tim Tanner showed up at the Twin Peaks site,
which is near their apartment, carrying cups of coffee and
marveling at the scene.
   ``I've been in other earthquakes, but nothing like this,'' said
Tanner.
   Tanner told Brown, who runs a travel agency, that he will be
busy for the next few days.
   ``People will want to be getting out of here,'' Tanner said.

   Housing construction, buffeted by rising
mortgage rates, fell for a second straight month in September,
declining to the weakest pace in seven years, the government
reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said that construction of new homes and
apartments dropped 5.2 percent following a 6.2 percent August
decline.
   The back-to-back drops pushed construction starts down to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.26 million units, the slowest
pace since October 1982.
   Many analysts blamed the September decline on builders' concerns
about high levels of unsold homes and worries that rising mortgage
rates during the month might further crimp new home sales.
   Because much of the fall-off was concentrated in the South, some
analysts suggested that Hurricane Hugo affected construction in
that area.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, said that the housing weakness highlighted the
urgent need for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to keep
the economy from toppling into a recession.
   Many analysts said they believed that the central bank has begun
a series of small credit-easing moves. They noted that a closely
watched indicator of Fed intentions, the overnight federal funds
rate, has dropped about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 percent since
the Friday the 13th stock market crash.
   The Fed pumped an additional $1.5 billion into the banking
system Wednesday, the third consecutive daily cash infusion since
Friday's market turmoil.
   While the Fed's efforts were aimed at reassuring skittish
financial markets about plentiful reserves for emergency loans,
analysts said that the Fed was likely to keep interest rates at
lower levels because of the weak housing construction and other
signs of a slowing economy.
   Fixed-rate mortgages, which climbed as high as 10.22 percent in
early September, have fallen slightly in October and now stand at
9.95 percent, according to a weekly survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   So far this year housing construction is running 6.2 percent
below a year ago with housing starts down in six of the last nine
months.
   For September, construction of single-family homes fell by 2.1
percent to an annual rate of 971,000 units, the second consecutive
month that single-family homes have been below the 1 million mark.
Construction of multi-family units was down 14.1 percent to an
annual rate of 292,000 units.
   In a disturbing sign for the future, permits for new units
dropped as well in September, falling 2.4 percent to 1.30 million
units.

   William F. Buckley Jr., the columnist,
conservative, television host, espionage author and sailing
aficionado, has still another description to his name:
harpsichordist.
   Buckley, host of PBS' ``Firing Line'' and founder of the
conservative National Review, made his debut as a solo
harpsichordist Tuesday night with the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra
after only a year of practice.
   Buckley performed an encore after the audience of 550 at the
Scottsdale Center for the Arts gave him a standing ovation for his
performance of Bach's Concerto in F Minor.
   He came off stage agonizing over a miscue. ``How could I have
screwed those three bars up?'' he groaned.
   ``We finished together,'' said conductor James Sedares, assuring
Buckley that everything went fine.

   During her 54 years in show business, Jane Wyman
has answered calls for 86 movies and nine years of ``Falcon
Crest.'' But the actress says she doesn't answer any calls as
Ronald Reagan's ex-wife.
   ``I don't have to be known as that,'' said Wyman, who ended an
eight-year boycott on interviews by speaking to Vanity Fair for its
November issue. ``I've been in this business longer than he has.
It's such bad taste.
   ``They wouldn't say it if I was Joe Blow's ex-wife. It wouldn't
even be mentioned.''
   Wyman and the former president were married from 1940-48.

   Not everybody likes fireworks, at least at 3
a.m., filmmaker Barry Levinson has discovered.
   Levinson's production company apologized Wednesday for staging a
fireworks show that dragged on until the wee hours Tuesday,
prompting residents of Baltimore's Fells Point neighborhood to
clamor for a noise curfew.
   The Oscar-winning director of ``Rain Man'' had obtained a
fireworks permit to film a recreation of a 1914 Fourth of July
celebration in the picturesque neighborhood by the harbor.
   After receiving numerous complaints from sleepless residents,
the Baltimore Fire Department placed an 11 p.m. curfew on the film
company's permit.
   ``We did get permission by the city to show fireworks, but the
vintage fireworks for the 1914 scene were a lot noisier than we had
envisioned,'' said Marie Rowe, a spokeswoman for Rowhouse
Productions. ``We're in the process of distributing explanations
and an apology to residents of Fells Point to make some kind of
recompense.''
   The film, now untitled, stars Aidan Quinn of ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' and Elizabeth Perkins of ``Big.''

   Guitarist Bob Mould said the year he spent working
on his farm after the painful breakup of the three-man band Husker
Du was therapeutic. After nine years and eight albums, the
Minneapolis-based band that was a favorite of critics and college
radio programmers split up in early 1988.
   ``It was always part of the chemistry of that band _ there were
certain elements of self-defeatism in there that I was getting real
tired of: fear of success, fear of not being the hippest
underground band,'' said Mould, who will perform Friday in Dallas
to promote his new solo album, ``Workbook.''
   After the year on his Minnesota farm, Mould moved to New York
City.
   ``I thought last year was pretty intense when I isolated myself
in the farm working. I look forward to recreating that kind of
intensity, and what better place than New York to feed off,'' he
said.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov says he plans to keep
dancing _ even though his career in ballet is almost over.
   ``My strongest talent, I would say, is to be a dancer,'' the
41-year-old dancer and film star told Vanity Fair. ``But that's
pretty much gone. ... Maybe two more good years.''
   ``My body is not what it used to be, because I really abused
myself a lot trying to learn so many dancing styles,'' said
Baryshnikov, who recently resigned as artistic director of the
American Ballet Theatre.
   But he said there was one style he failed to master: tap. ``Just
forget it,'' he said. ``I tried very hard when Gregory Hines (his
co-star in the film ``White Nights'') gave me pointers, but I was
the dumbest. My legs wouldn't work that way.''

Nott, but she stole the show in a stunning white strapless beaded
gown and high-collared jacket.
   At a glittering ceremony Tuesday night climaxing a charity

presented to designer Nicole Farhi and the British Glamour award to
Antony Price. Catherine Walker, who designed Diana's dress, was a
nominee in the glamour category.
   Sir Hardy Amies, 80, who has designed Queen Elizabeth II's
clothes since the 1950s, was given a special award for his lifetime
contribution to fashion. ``Longevity pays,'' he said afterward.
   Fraser and Nott established Workers for Freedom in 1985 in a
tiny shop in London's Soho district and have built an enthusiastic
international following for their romantic folkloric style and use
of natural fabrics.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Predicts Free Trade Treaty With Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said
Wednesday he can foresee the day when the United States and Mexico
will have a free trade treaty similar to the U.S-Canadian
arrangement.
   Looking even further into the future _ perhaps 20 years or so _
Mosbacher told a Senate banking panel the United States should set
a goal of having free trade among all countries in the Western
Hemisphere.
   Mosbacher said informal talks have already been held with
Mexican trade officials about removing trade barriers separating
the two countries.
   ``They are cautious,'' he said. ``We should not push them too
hard, too fast. But they are interested, very interested.''
   Earlier, Mosbacher had told the international finance and
monetary policy subcommittee that the Bush administration hopes
Mexico will ``be the first olive out of the jar'' among Latin
American nations able to shore up their economies and provide
expanded markets for U.S. exporters.
   He noted Mexico is the first of those nations to work out
agreements on handling its huge foreign debt and, under the
nation's new leadership, has reduced its inflation rate below 20
percent.
   Responding to skepticism from several Democratic committee
members about the merits of the so-called Brady plan for Third
World debt relief, Mosbacher said: ``I agree the ... plan will not
work by itself, but it's part of the puzzle.''
   Continuing his focus on Mexico as an early barometer for overall
administration policy, Mosbacher said that country's ability to
reduce some of its big interest payments has freed money for
investment.
   Mosbacher said a key to developing export markets in Latin
American countries will be for U.S. businesses to take a long view
of their investments rather than short-term profits.

   Space shuttle Atlantis darted
between two storm systems and thundered flawlessly into orbit
today, starting the plutonium-powered Galileo probe on a
twice-delayed, roundabout journey to Jupiter.
   The 132-ton winged Atlantis with a crew of five lifted off at
12:53 p.m., riding a 700-foot column of flame out over the Atlantic
on a five-day mission that anti-nuclear activists fearful of a
Challenger-like accident were unable to stop.
   Two minutes after liftoff, the two solid fuel booster rockets
burned out and fell away as planned. Mission Control reported 8{
minutes after blastoff that the shuttle had reached orbit more than
100 miles above the Earth.
   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control said.
   ``I feel a lot better,'' replied Atlantis commander Don Williams.
   Also feeling better were scientists who have worked since 1978
on the Galileo project, surviving money problems that delayed the
original 1982 launch date and the 1986 Challenger explosion that
pushed the launch off three more years.
   ``It feels great. It's been a long time,'' said Lennard Fisk,
NASA's chief scientist. ``Each of these missions opens up a new
science door.''
   During the first hour of flight, the astronauts encountered
minor problems with a cooling system and with an electronic part on
one of the ship's maneuvering engines. Both were corrected quickly.
   Atlantis was grounded Tuesday by rain and last week by a faulty
engine computer. Its launch was in doubt up to a few minutes before
liftoff today because of a cold front to one side and offshore rain
clouds to the other.
   Thousands were at the Kennedy Space Center and nearby vantage
points to watch the start of the 31st space shuttle mission, during
which the astronauts will deploy Galileo and also conduct medical
and other scientific experiments.
   About 200 armed security guards _ on land, in boats and in the
air _ were alert for anti-nuclear trespassers who had threatened to
sit on the pad if necessary to halt the launch, but liftoff took
place without incident.
   The astronauts were to release the 6,700-pound Galileo from
Atlantis' cargo bay about 6{ hours after liftoff for a looping,
six-year, 2.4-billion-mile journey to Jupiter, the colossus of the
solar system with a radius 11 times that of Earth.
   The $1.5 billion Galileo, the most expensive unmanned space
vehicle ever built, is expected to give the best look yet at the
mysteries of another planet. ``It is the Rolls-Royce of
spacecraft,'' said Clayne Yeates, a mission manager.
   The mission ends Monday in the Mojave Desert at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif. Besides Williams, the crew members are pilot
Mike McCulley and mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   Anti-nuclear activists last week lost a lawsuit to block the
launch. They charged that the 50 pounds of plutonium that supply
electricity to Galileo could scatter radiation over Florida in the
event of an accident.
   NASA says the chances of a plutonium release are 1-in-25,000,
and even if there were a release there would be no appreciable harm
to the public.
   Demonstrators had said they might try to halt liftoff by
infiltrating the launch area. But Bruce Gagnon, a protest leader,
said his group had made its point Monday when eight members got
arrested for trespassing at the space center.
   Two more people were arrested Tuesday _ one for crossing a space
center boundary and another for releasing a helium balloon shaped
like a person less than an hour before launch time.
   Once it reaches Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into its
atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months for clues to the
formation of the universe.
   Scientists believe the planet still holds much of the material,
in its original state, from which the universe formed more than 15
billion years ago.
   NASA had been concerned whether an Air Force control center in
Sunnyvale, Calif., inside Tuesday's earthquake zone, would be
operating to command the rocket that sends Galileo into deep space
once it leaves the shuttle.
   But the space agency received assurances at an early morning
meeting that the Consolidated Space Test Center at Onizuka Air
Force Base would be ready.
   Under launch-team rules, a second straight postponement today
would have triggered an automatic 48-hour delay, meaning Atlantis
would be grounded until at least Friday. The rule is designed to
prevent launch team fatigue.
   NASA had to launch the Galileo by Nov. 21 or else wait until
July 1991 for the Earth and Jupiter to come back into proper
alignment.
   The delays worried NASA because of the cost of keeping the
spacecraft on standby and because Galileo's nuclear power pack was
running down.

<HEAD>Judge Rules City of Stamford True Owner of Depression-Era Mural</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An art restorer has no claim of ownership of a
Depression-era mural that the city of Stamford, Conn., mistakenly
threw in the garbage in 1970, a judge ruled.
   The 8-by-100-foot mural, painted in 1934 by artist James
Daughtery as part of the federal Works Progress Administration, has
been appraised at $1.25 million by Sotheby's.
   The discarded mural was obtained by an official of the federal
General Services Administration who oversaw the restoration of WPA
artwork, and sent to restorer Hiram H. Hoelzer to keep until
federal funding was found to restore it, according to court records.
   In 1986, when the city planned to apply for its own grant for
restoration, Hoelzer claimed the city had given up its rights to
the mural, and he claimed ownership.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled Tuesday that ``it was
reasonable for city officials to believe that, as long as Mr.
Hoelzer did not assert ownership of the mural, he continued to
possess it as a custodian or bailee,'' a person who holds something
temporarily in trust.

<HEAD>Honduran Network Sues Swaggart Ministries Over Broadcast Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Honduran television network has sued
Jimmy Swaggart Ministries for nearly $14,000 in fees and interest
for broadcasting programs, but an attorney for Swaggart said the
organization is paid up.
   The Corporacion Centroamericana de Comunicaciones, which
operates under the name VICA TV, claims the ministry and its
broadcast affiliate owe $13,700 from a $111,600 contract executed
two years ago.
   The Swaggart ministries and Swaggart Television and Radio
Communications, or Starcom, owe $6,100 in principal and $7,600 in
interest, according to a lawsuit filed earlier this month in
Judicial District Court.
   But Emile Weber, an attorney for Swaggart, said Wednesday, ``We
paid them all we owe. ...I have the canceled check for $6,100 right
here.'' He thought the lawsuit stemmed from a breakdown in
communications.
   The lawsuit states that VICA TV agreed to broadcast Swaggart's
shows between Nov. 1, 1987 and Nov. 30, 1988 over three channels:
Channel 2 in San Pedro Sula, Channel 13 in Comayagua and Channel 9,
serving LaCeiba and the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.
   ``Defendants have paid some of the monies owed,'' the suit said,
but a balance of $6,100 remains payable.
   It seeks interest because of the alleged failure to make proper
monthly payments, as well as legal interest, attorney's fees and
court costs.

<HEAD>Actor's Half-Brother Waives Extradition to Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The half-brother of actor Larry Hagman waived
extradition to Texas on Wednesday to face a charge of
misapplication of funds.
   Gary Hagman, a lawyer from Weatherford, Texas, was reported
missing Sept. 26 and taken into custody Tuesday as he tried to
retrieve a car from the parking lot of a hotel on the Las Vegas
Strip.
   Hagman, 48, who shares a father with the actor, was charged Oct.
2 in Weatherford with misapplication of fiduciary funds.
Weatherford officials would not provide details on the charge,
except to say it stemmed from a complaint from a financial
institution.
   Hagman, in handcuffs and jail clothing, waived extradition
during a brief appearance before state District Judge Donald Mosley.
   Two Weatherford investigators came to Las Vegas to follow up
reports that Hagman had been sighted last week in a casino,
Weatherford police Capt. Raymond Pritchard said Wednesday. The
investigators were to return Hagman to Weatherford after the
necessary paperwork was complete, Pritchard said.
   The charge against Hagman is a second-degree felony that carries
a prison term of 2 to 20 years and a fine of up to $10,000.

<HEAD>Independent Record Promoter Pleads Guilty in Payola Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent record promoter indicted in a
federal payola probe pleaded guilty to charges of covering up
bribes made to radio stations in exchange for favorable play of
albums he was hired to push.
   William Craig, 44, who was one of four people indicted, pleaded
guilty Tuesday in federal court to one count of failing to disclose
the payments and to two counts of assisting in the preparation of
false federal income tax returns.
   Craig and fellow record promoter Ralph Tashjian, 41, of San
Mateo were accused by prosecutors of making payments totaling
nearly $300,000 to radio station executives in Southern and Western
states between 1980 and 1986. Failing to disclose payola _ not the
paying of it _ is a violation of federal law.
   The charges stemmed from an investigation by the Justice
Department's Organized Crime Strike Force. Four people, including a
former vice president and general manager of a Los Angeles radio
station that has since been sold, were indicted by a federal grand
jury in February 1988.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner has said the indictments were the
most significant payola case since the 1970s. He said many record
companies hired Craig and Tashjian to promote records _ without
knowing their money allegedly was used as payola.
   Tashjian's wife, Valerie, also was indicted, but charges against
her were later dropped. Charges remain against George Wilson
Crowell, once an executive of the former KIQQ radio station that
later was sold.
   Tashjian pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, one felony
count of filing a false tax return and one felony count of
obstructing a grand jury investigation. Neither he nor Craig has
been sentenced.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today signed a disaster-relief
declaration for the earthquake-ravaged San Francisco Bay area and
said ``we will take every step and make every effort'' to help spur
recovery from the devastation.
   Bush said he probably will fly to the area for a personal
inspection but left open when that might happen. ``I don't want to
get in the way,'' he said, adding that ``the last thing we want to
do is clutter things up.''
   His press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said later that the trip
``won't be for a few days,'' but an official said it could be
Saturday.
   Fitzwater said there is $273 million in unallocated funds from a
$1.1 billion appropriation for the Hurricane Hugo cleanup ``which
can be used for immediate assistance in San Francisco.''
   ``That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the
emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider
appropriate requests for follow-on funding,'' said the presidential
spokesman.
   Fitzwater said the earthquake relief would cost ``more'' than
the $1.1 billion Hugo cleanup, but he declined to estimate how much.
   Numerous world leaders have sent Bush messages of sympathy and
offers of support, including Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who received U.S. help after last December's devastating earthquake
in Armenia.
   ``If these countries can help, we certainly welcome their
assistance,'' said Fitzwater.
   Bush announced his action during a morning meeting with
Republican congressional leaders.
   ``As daylight breaks there in California, I want the citizens of
the San Francisco Bay area and its neighbors first to know that our
hearts are with them as they face this terrible tragedy,'' the
president said. ``Words can't adequately convey our sadness.''
   Bush said ``we will take every step and make every effort to
help the bay area in its hour of need.''
   He said he received an update by telephone from Vice President
Dan Quayle, who was preparing to take a helicopter tour of the
ravaged area.
   Asked about the extent of the damage, Bush said the death toll
``seems to be mounting and we are concerned. But it's hard to put a
total number on it at this point. I've seen none.'' Authorities in
California say more than 270 people were killed and hundreds were
injured.
   ``We're working with state and local officials to assure the
relief effort is coordinated and effective as possible,'' Bush said.
   He praised the efforts of private relief agencies such as the
Red Cross and called on Americans to support those organizations.
   The disaster-relief declaration will authorize use of federal
funds in the recovery effort. Bush said his chief of staff, John
Sununu, was trying to ensure that the relief effort is
``coordinated and effective as possible.''
   He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which
was criticized for its response to Hurricane Hugo, ``is doing a
good job. They're out front and they're trying to respond.''
   Later, Bush left the White House to tour FEMA's Emergency
Information and Coordination Center and defended the agency. ``I
hope there will be less carping ... I think they took a hit on the
other one (Hurricane Hugo),'' he said.
   In an operations room, Bush talked by telephone with Jeff Rubin,
director of California's Emergency Medical Services, who had just
called federal officials.
   ``Jeff, this is the president. How's it doing out there? Are you
getting a lot of requests for emergency medical service?'' Bush
said.
   He ended the conversation saying, ``Well, that's good.'' Bush
then told aides, ``He says, `Not so many requests'.''
   Bush's declaration said a major disaster exists in a
seven-county area in Northern California. The federal government
normally pays at least 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding bridges
and other public facilities that are destroyed, and provides
low-cost loans for individuals and businesses.
   The areas covered by Bush's order include the city and county of
San Francisco and the counties of Alameda, Monterey, San Benito,
San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.
   FEMA said damage surveys are continuing in other areas and
additional counties may be added later.
   Bush met during the morning with a group of elementary school
principals and singled out Ray E. Tolcacher, superintendent of the
Windsor School District in the bay area. ``We just hope that your
kids and your schools and all the families are safe and sound,''
Bush said.
   He said the damage was ``a matter of grave national concern.''
   Within a few hours of the quake, the bureaucracy was in motion,
from Bush's decision to send Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner
flying overnight to California to the establishment of a command
center at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) a few
blocks from the White House.
   The administration, which was criticized for its response to
Hurricane Hugo, made a determined effort to demonstrate that the
government was moving quickly now.
   Fitzwater, during an early-morning appearance at FEMA, said,
``At the moment, it is very reassuring to see that the
response-organization at the local, state and federal (levels) is
performing so well. People in San Francisco are responding in
heroic fashion in many cases.
   ``People are staying calm but it looks like, in this major
disaster, that the people and organizations involved are performing
with distinction,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Obviously, we've already started moving,'' said FEMA's Grant
Peterson. ``We're not waiting to respond, we're responding right
now,'' he added as the agency strove to avoid the criticism it
reaped for its response to Hurricane Hugo last month.

<TEXT>
   President Bush held out the prospect of
improved relations with East Germany on Wednesday but suggested it
was ``way too early to say'' whether Wednesday's power shuffle
could pave the way.
   U.S. officials reacted to the ouster of longtime Communist Party
Leader Erich Honecker by challenging his successor _ Politburo
member Egon Krenz _ to embrace reforms sweeping other Eastern bloc
nations.
   ``The United States is prepared to develop stronger and more
constructive relations with the German Democratic Republic (East
Germany),'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``It is up to the new leadership there to demonstrate through
its deeds that it's ready to move in that direction,'' the
spokesman said.
   Still, Bush himself voiced skepticism over the prospects of any
major policy turnabouts as a result of Wednesday's upheaval.
   ``There's dynamic change taking place in Eastern Europe and now,
it appears, in (East Germany). But whether this step is a step
toward more openness or not, I think it's way too early to say,''
the president said.
   ``There's nothing in the record to indicate that it is,'' he
added.
   Speaking with reporters during a picture-taking session with
Republican leaders, Bush said Krenz had been ``very much in
accord'' with the hardline policies of Honecker, who was stripped
of power after 18 years of rule.
   Honecker, 77, was removed as party leaders met to discuss the
flight of East Germans to the West and growing pro-democracy
protests. He was replaced by the younger Krenz, 52, who had been in
charge of security issues and government-run youth groups.
   Whether the selection of a new party chief ``reflects a change
in East-West relations, I don't think so. I don't think it does,''
Bush said.
   Fitzwater called Honecker's removal by communist party leaders
``obviously a response to the mass exodus of tens of thousands'' of
East Germans ``who have sought freedom and a better life in the
West.''
   ``We hope thus change signals movement (by East Germany) toward
reforms and repsonds to the hopes and aspirations of its people,''
Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
United States will be watching to see if the new East German
leadership is ``prepared to bring perestroika to East Germany.''

   A huge surge in calling caused a telephone
``gridlock'' in the San Francisco area Wednesday even though
earthquake damage to the phone system itself was minor, Pacific
Bell officials said.
   Anxious callers trying to reach relatives, friends and offices
in the wake of Tuesday evening's devastating quake overloaded the
system and long-distance carriers were blocking many calls going
into the area, the officials said.
   But the network was working and millions of other calls were
getting through.
   ``Our systems actually survived,'' said Sue Galloway, district
manager for Pacific Bell's network in Southern California. ``I have
no real serious reports of any major switching damage or facilities
damage.''
   ``The local network is in fine shape,'' said Mary Hallisey, a
Washington spokeswoman for Pacific Bell's parent, the Pacific
Telesis Group. ``There is a gridlock problem based on the fact that
so many people are trying to call in all at once. ... When you pick
up the phone out there you don't get a dial tone right away. ...
The system is not out, it's just a very slow dial tone.
   ``You've got customers trying to get ahold of friends, loved
ones, work,'' Galloway said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``It's
extremely heavy.''
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. appealed to the nation not to
try telephoning the earthquake area, and Lissa Zanville, a Pacific
Bell spokeswoman, said, ``We're asking people not to call in for a
24-hour period.''
   Hallisey said Pacific's system was running on emergency power
generators that ``kicked in very smoothly'' when the quake hit.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was blocking part of
a flood of calls into the area so San Franciscans could call out.
   ``We are urging people elsewhere to not call into that area so
we can devote more of our circuits to what we're trying to do _
give priority to calls coming out of that affected area,'' he said.
   ``But calls are getting through,'' Linnen added.
   Jim Nelson, director of AT&amp;T's network operations center in
Bedminister, N.J., said the nationwide volume of long-distance
calls swelled to 2{ times normal between 8 p.m. and midnight EDT on
Tuesday, to well over 40 million calls.
   Nationwide volume could reach 140 million calls on Wednesday,
compared with 100 million normally, he said.
   About 500,000 calls an hour _ twice normal _ were going out of
the San Francisco area Wednesday, while four times the normal
number were going in, Nelson said. Still, 60-70 percent of the
incoming calls and 30 percent of the outgoing calls were being
blocked, he said.
   AT&amp;T handles about 70 percent of the nation's long-distance
calls.

   A woman who chased her teen-age daughter
from their home in a dispute over voodoo power has been arrested
after the teen-ager's severely battered baby was thrown from a
window.
   The 8{-month-old baby, who suffered tears in her vagina, burns
on her arms and buttocks and bruises and abrasions all over her
body, was reported in stable condition at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center.
   Lou Vera Denson, a former city employee, was booked Monday on a
felony child abuse charge.
   When officers arrested her, she ``was telling us she was a
devil,'' said police Sgt. Keith Burton.
   Burton said Denson threatened officers, telling them: ``I'll put
a curse on you.''
   The baby's 17-year-old mother, not identified because of her
age, told authorities that Denson made her leave home about a week
earlier.
   ``This grandmother claimed that the (child's) mother had more
power by looking at you and she couldn't stand it and made her
leave,'' said police Capt. Larry Wallace.
   Neighbor Robert Porter said he saw Denson mix some sort of
chemical and ``sprinkle it around the house and doors'' over the
weekend, and smear it on another daughter, Judy Marie Denson, 22,
who lives with her.
   At one point, Porter said, he saw the elder Denson sitting
outside holding a butcher knife.
   Officers went to the home Friday to investigate a disturbance,
but left after being told the baby was all right, police said
Tuesday.
   Police returned Monday when a neighbor reported a child had been
thrown from the house.
   Inside, police said, windows were broken and furniture was
smashed. Food and debris covered the floor. Telephones had been
ripped out and thrown outside. Pages were torn from a Bible and
scattered inside the house.
   ``Every faucet in the house was running,'' said Burton. ``There
was such a stench of Clorox and ammonia that you could not breath
for any length of time.''
   Denson also was charged with abusive language and assault on a
police officer, as was Judy Marie. The Densons remained jailed
without bond Wednesday.
   Denson's brother, John Hicks, said Tuesday that his sister was
mentally ill and had been hospitalized at least once.
   ``A year ago she had a breakdown,'' Hicks said. ``My sister's
very nice. Nobody would ever think she would do anything like this.
But she's sick. She's just really sick.''

<HEAD>Air Force Officer in Spy Investigation No Longer Restricted to Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force officer whose activities in West
Berlin are under investigation because of espionage allegations has
been released from restriction to Kelly Air Force Base, authorities
said.
   Capt. John Vladimir Hirsch, 34, an electronic security officer,
has been at Kelly since Aug. 30 after he was taken into custody by
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Since arriving at
the base he has been accompanied everywhere by an escort.
   A search of his West Berlin apartment turned up records of
$120,000 in bank accounts, photographs of NATO military
installations and classified documents.
   Hirsch has not been charged with any crime, but he has been
under suspicion of selling secrets to the Soviet bloc.
   He was released from restriction to base Tuesday because
military law limits the amount of time someone can be restricted
without charges being filed, said Lt. Col. John Worthington, a
spokesman for the Electronic Security Command headquartered at
Kelly.
   Hirsch does not have to stay on the base but must tell his
commander if he plans to leave San Antonio, and his top-secret
security clearance remains revoked, officials said.
   The investigation began in July when polygraph examiners decided
Hirsch was not telling the truth during a routine security update.
   He had been assigned to West Berlin at a communications unit
belonging to the secretive Electronic Security Command, which
collects intelligence on Warsaw Pact radar and communications.
   His current duties as an electronic engineer do not involve
classified projects, Worthington said.
   Hirsch, 33, was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and became a
U.S. citizen in 1971. He has been in the Air Force since 1979.

<TEXT>
   Congress needs to wrestle with the vague
federal law that led to the revocation of Oliver North's retirement
pay after he was convicted on Iran-Contra charges, a panel of legal
experts said Wednesday.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
he will draft a report outlining arguments on both sides of what
has become a politically divisive issue.
   ``We've got to solve this thing. We've got to make this thing
square for everybody,'' Biden said, suggesting lawmakers should
deal not just with North's case, but with the situation of any
federal official _ including members of Congress _ convicted of a
felony.
   North's retirement pay as a Marine lieutenant colonel was
$23,000 a year, less than he reportedly now makes for a single
speech on the lecture circuit.
   The pay was suspended July 5 after he was convicted of three
felony counts. The law provides that anyone convicted of one of the
counts, shredding government documents, ``shall forfeit his
office.'' North is appealing the convictions.
   The General Accounting Office, which has jurisdiction over
federal pay matters, ruled North's status as a retired military
officer came under that provision of the law, and that forfeiting
his office meant he no longer qualified for military retirement pay.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has forced the Senate to schedule a
vote Nov. 3 on a bill that would restore North's pension without
changing the underlying law.
   Legal scholars said at Wednesday's hearing that might be
unconstitutional, since only the courts have the power to sentence
and only the president has the power to pardon. But they said
Congress may want to address the issue of whether the law meant for
``office'' to include military positions.
   Technically, military retirement pay is not a pension based on
past service but a reduced salary based on an officer continuing to
hold a commission and remaining subject to reactivation to duty.
   Peter M. Shane, a constitutional law scholar at the University
of Iowa, argued that singling out North for special treatment
instead of changing the underlying law would amount to ``trial
under the rule of politics, and not under the rule of law.''
   Eugene Hickok, a political science professor at Dickinson
College in Pennsylvania, urged Congress to pass legislation that
would make it clear the document-shredding law was not intended to
force forfeiture of military retirement pay.

   Federal marshals have arrested a California
man sought by West Germany on charges he murdered prisoners while a
Nazi concentration camp guard during World War II, the Justice
Department announced Wednesday.
   Bruno Karl Blach, 69, was arrested Tuesday night at his home in
La Habra, Calif., based on a warrant issued by a court in Duisburg,
West Germany last June, the department said.
   Blach is charged with killing three prisoners being transported
from the Wiener Neudorf concentration camp to the Mauthausen death
camp in Austria between April 2 and 14, 1945, the department said.
   If extradited, Blach would become only the fourth American ever
extradited for Nazi war crimes.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service already has ordered
Blach's deportation to West Germany, after finding that he
participated in Nazi persecution. He is currently appealing the
April 1987 ruling, as well as the German extradition warrant.
   Blach was denied bail at a bond hearing in Los Angeles on
Wednesday, but he will get a chance to challenge the extradition at
another hearing Monday in U.S. District Court there, officials
said. The Justice Department will represent West Germany's claim.
   ``We are very encouraged by West Germany having taken this case
very seriously in fulfilling its responsibilities of prosecuting
Nazi crimes,'' said Neal Sher, who heads the department's Office of
Special Investigations.
   The U.S. Immigration Court found in 1987 that Blach, who
immigrated here in 1956 from Austria, served as a guard and
dog-handler at the Dachau concentration camp in Germany from 1940
to 1943, and later at the Wiener Neudorf camp in Austria.
   The court also found that in April 1945, Blach took part in the
forced evacuation by foot of prisoners to Mauthausen, during which
he shot to death at least one person _ an elderly, disabled Jewish
inmate, the Justice Department said.

<HEAD>White House Denies Rift on U.S. Policy Toward Soviets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House on Wednesday denied any
internal rift on U.S. policy toward the Soviets despite seemingly
divergent tones in recent comments by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged,
however, that ``We sing from the same song sheet, but there are
several verses.''
   While Quayle appeared to hew to a harder line, citing the
``potential source of serious problems in Soviet-American
relations,'' Baker, in a Monday speech, seemed to take a more open
and expansive approach. He said, ``The prospects for a lasting
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations are better than ever before.''
   Baker announced that the United States stands ready to give the
Soviets technical assistance to help ``in certain areas of Soviet
economic reform.''
   The Washington Times quoted Quayle as telling reporters Tuesday
in San Francisco, ``Let them reform themselves,'' meaning the
Soviets.
   Quayle spoke later Tuesday in Los Angeles to a Town Hall of
California meeting, a day after Baker spoke in New York to the
Foreign Policy Association.
   Asked if their comments indicated a rift within the
administration over how to deal with the Soviets, Fitzwater said,
``There are no differences ... between Vice President Quayle and
Secretary Baker on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We all agree that glastnost and perestroika are encouraging
trends that America supports. It is in the western interest for
these reforms to succeed. We offer democracy as an example to the
world and we have continually said the Soviets must solve their
internal structural problems themselves but we are always ready to
provide advice and counsel.''
   Baker's comments appeared to indicate a more open-arms approach
for the Bush administration in the face of criticism from some
quarters that it has been too reticent to take advantage of the
opportunities to urge on reform movements in the East Bloc
governments.
   He did, however, mix praise with criticism, stating that the
Soviets were reluctant to withdraw from regional conflicts.
   Quayle did not mention offers of technical assistance in his
speech on Tuesday.
   He also mentioned Soviet involvement in regional conflicts _ in
Nicaragua, North Korea, Afghanistan and Cambodia _ that have been a
sore spot for the United States, and said they showed the ``darker
side of Soviet foreign policy.

   The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost
before the earth quit shaking in Northern California. Nearly as
quickly, the Red Cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in 25
shelters. The federal government called a meeting.
   Once again, the nation's volunteer agencies were the quickest to
assist local authorities when disaster struck, even as the White
House and other federal institutions, stung by complaints of a
sorry, tardy effort in the wake of Hurricane Hugo, burned the
midnight oil this time.
   Hugo's devastation last month in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands
and the Carolinas extended into the treasuries of the private
relief agencies. Even so, they were ready for the San Francisco
shaker.
   The Red Cross, the Salvation Army, church groups and other
organizations like REACT, the citizens-band radio volunteers, all
work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency as well as local
officials in planning for disasters. But none awaits orders from
the Washington bureaucracy, which still took hours getting into
gear.
   ``We don't wait for anybody,'' said Col. Leon Ferraez,
communications director of the Salvation Army. ``We're there the
minute the news is on.''
   According to Ferraez, the Salvation Army had 12 mobile canteens
on their way to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes.
All Salvation Army facilities in the bay area, including 34
community service centers and scores of other units, have been
turned over to the relief effort. Thousands of meals had been
served and hundreds, if not thousands, housed in those facilities
by noon Wednesday, Ferraez said.
   In the first hours, the canteens provided beverages, sandwiches
and donuts to victims of the quake as well as police, firefighters
and volunteer relief workers. Longer term services range from
providing housing and clothing to counseling. ``If somebody just
needs to talk, we're prepared to do that,'' Ferraez added.
   Nationwide, the Salvation Army relies upon 1.2 million
volunteers, as measured against just 5,000 paid workers _ low pay
at that. The organization has long had the reputation of directing
the most of every donated dollar into services, as opposed to
administrative and fund-raising costs.
   The Red Cross mobilized hundreds of disaster workers and opened
25 shelters when the quake struck. Distribution centers in Los
Angeles, Sacramento and Portland, Ore., began shipping cots,
blankets, and other supplies by Wednesday morning.
   In San Francisco, a downtown convention center housed more than
1,000 evacuees under Red Cross auspices. More than 500 residents of
the fire-ravaged Marina area took refuge in a local middle school.
   The Red Cross also transformed an airport terminal into a
shelter, and three nearby hotels, the Sheraton, Ramada and Embassy
Suites, turned over their lodgings to the agency. Other Red Cross
shelters included one at San Andreas High School, bearing the name
of the fault which triggered the calamity.
   The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in
its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September, mostly
on flood relief in Texas. Then Hugo came along, triggering an
effort the agency estimates will cost $42 million _ the most ever.
   ``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit
back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster
resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster
services.

   Susie Allen was fighting rush-hour traffic on her way home
across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Kim House was walking
with her fiance and Bob Witzgall was taking a shower in his hotel
room. Then it hit.
   Northern California's earthquake at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday turned a
routine rush hour into tragedy, sent frightened tourists and
natives rushing into the streets and left victims and heroes.
   At 3 p.m., thousands of baseball fans began streaming into
Candlestick Park for Game No. 3 of the World Series, scheduled to
begin 2{ hours later. The first pitch was never thrown.
   Ms. Allen was amid heavy traffic heading out of San Francisco on
the lower tier of the Bay Bridge when the span began to ripple and
sway.
   ``First I thought my shocks weren't working,'' she said. ``Then
I realized the car wasn't having problems; the ground was having
problems.
   ``The road rose up to meet me,'' said Ms. Allen, who was heading
from her office in San Francisco to her home in Oakland. ``I
couldn't figure out why the road was at a 50-degree angle to my
face.''
   Ms. Allen, 26, stopped her car, locked it, and joined other
motorists walking toward a 30-foot gap created when a piece of the
upper deck collapsed onto the lower level.
   Thomas and Debby Kelly, a vacationing couple from Ringwood,
Okla., were on the upper level and took home video pictures,
acquired by ABC station KGO-TV. Their shots included one of a small
car that tumbled nose first over the gap.
   ``Ohhh, gosh! That could have been us....'' Mrs. Kelly gasped as
the red car fell to the bridge's lower level. Then, to her husband,
she said, ``Thomas, we need to get down there and help!''
   Cathy Miranker was driving north on an elevated section of
Highway 101 to her home in San Francisco.
   ``It was like bumper cars,'' she said. ``It literally started to
buckle bend and bounce. Cars were bounced into the air on the
roadway. Cars tried to stop but the motion kept them running even
if you slammed on the brakes.''
   Cars slammed into each other and into guardrails and stopped.
One woman rolled down her window and asked if she had car problems.
   ``I said, `No, it's not your car, it's an earthquake.'''
   Across the bay in Oakland, George Donovan was driving his
tractor-trailer rig on the upper deck of Interstate 880, the Nimitz
Freeway.
   ``The pavement started to move. I had waves of asphalt come up
over my windshield,'' he said. ``It was undulating all around me.
It was like a Disney ride.''
   A mile-long stretch of the highway's upper level collapsed onto
the lower deck, crushing more than 250 people, authorities
estimated. Motorists and passers-by rushed to help those trapped.
   Ms. House, of San Jose, was walking in San Francisco's
Tenderloin district with her fiance.
   ``We heard an explosion and it turned out to be concrete from
the walls and windows blowing out,'' she said. ``People were
running out of the buildings.''
   At the same time, a transient lay on his bed in a hotel for the
homeless.
   ``The bed moved from one side (of the room) to the other,''
Douglas Schmillen said. ``I didn't know if the walls were going to
come down next.''
   Witzgall, a conventioneer from Sacramento, was showering in his
Union Square hotel room.
   ``It was scary. I couldn't get out of there fast enough,'' he
said. ``It started out as a little rumble, but it was pretty
violent where I was.''
   Dick Moore, news director of WSOC-TV in Charlotte, N.C., was in
a third-floor office in San Francisco.
   ``The first thing I saw really was someone who knew what was
going on standing in a doorway bracing themself under a doorway,''
Moore said. ``We went out on the street and saw a lot of people
pouring out into the streets, looking up at the buildings to see
any signs of physical damage.''
   People throughout the city gathered outside after the quake.
Some congratulated each other over surviving and other talked about
what they were doing when the earthquake struck.
   ``I'm religious,'' Roland Hidalgo said, standing in a parking
lot off Market Street. ``I prayed.''
   At Candlestick Park, 60,000 baseball fans had been waiting for
the game to begin. Members of the Oakland Athletics and the San
Francisco Giants warmed up on the field.
   Umpire Al Clark was in the dressing room.
   ``As soon as it started, my legs went numb,'' he said. ``I
looked up, and the walls were waving. I became frightened, and I
realized it was an earthquake.''
   Some fans cheered as the stadium's concrete overhang rippled
ominously; other sat shaken and cried. All were sent home and the
game was canceled.
   The Gatlin Brothers, the country group scheduled to sing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner,'' thought fans were stomping until they saw
the stadium sway.
   ``The ground was moving and all three of us began praying,''
said Larry Gatlin, according to group spokeswoman Kathy Gangwisch.
``It was one of the scariest moments of my lifetime.''

<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said Wednesday he
is optimistic that a cease-fire agreement with Angola's Marxist
government can be revived before the end of the month.
   Savimbi, speaking in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press from the Ivory Coast, also said there was a good possibility
for a mutual release of war prisoners with the government.
   The Angolan peace process had been stalled following what
appeared to be a breakthrough last June between Savimbi's UNITA
rebel, who receive U.S. backing, and the Soviet-supported
government. Among other measures, the two sides reached agreement
on a cease-fire to end their 14-year conflict.
   But fighting resumed within weeks, and Savimbi felt that the
chief peace mediator, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, was
taking sides with the MPLA government. There also were
recriminations about whether Savimbi had agreed to go into exile
and to integrate his forces into the Angolan army.
   Savimbi patched up his differences with Mobutu during weekend
meetings in Paris following discussions in Washington, and he
sounded more upbeat Wednesday than he has at any time since the
breakthrough in June.
   He said he was optimistic the cease-fire could be back on track
``during this month of October.'' He raised the possibility that
some African nations might contribute troops to monitor the
cease-fire if it is revived.
   But even if a truce is agreed to, the MPLA and UNITA face the
challenging task of reaching a political settlement. With U.S.
support, UNITA is calling for free and fair elections to be a key
ingredient of the peace process.
   The Angolan government has a much narrower view of national
reconciliation, insisting that the existing constitution remain
unchanged.
   But Savimbi said recent statements by senior Angolan officials
suggest a more flexible attitude on reconciliation.
   They are ``not so intransigent'' as they were before, said
Savimbi, who stopped off in the Ivory Coast while en route to his
home base in rebel-held southeast Angola.
   Savimbi said there are between 3,000 and 5,000 MPLA prisoners in
UNITA hands. He said the government has refused to disclose the
number of rebel prisoners it holds.
   The United States provides about $40 million to UNITA, and Bush
administration officials were angry when Savimbi declined to attend
talks last month designed to reinstate the cease-fire.
   Savimbi agreed to resume his role in the peace process after
talks with President Bush on Oct. 5 in Washington.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Claims Gorbachev Directed Effort to Oust Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist Party's traveling
maverick, accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday of
directing a campaign of ``provocative, tendentious, lying
statements'' to drive him out of politics.
   In the past month, Yeltsin has been accused in print and on
television of turning a U.S. speaking tour into a drinking and
spending spree and of showing up at a police station late at night,
dripping wet, with an elaborate and false tale of an attempt to
drown him.
   Yeltsin once was Gorbachev's man at the helm of the Moscow
Communist Party, but he was fired from there and the ruling
Politburo in 1987 after demanding faster reform and saying a
personality cult could develop around his mentor.
   He made a unique political comeback by winning 89 percent of the
vote to represent Moscow in the Congress of People's Deputies.
   A statement signed by Yeltsin and distributed Wednesday by his
aides said of Gorbachev: ``At his command, a whole series of
provocative, tendentious, lying statements have been published in
the Soviet press and broadcast on television.''
   In May, Yeltsin said he spoke with Gorbachev often by telephone.
At a closed party meeting Friday, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin and
several other legislators who favor rapid change of forming ``a
fascist clique striving for power,'' said editors who attended.
   Yeltsin's statement Wednesday accused Gorbachev of a ``political
farce ... a new attempt to ruin my health and to knock me out of
the sphere of political struggle.''
   ``I consider it unacceptable and dangerous to shift from
political struggle to immoral and unscrupulous methods of moral and
psychological elimination of opponents,'' the statement said.
   ``This will result in a complete breakup of moral and ethical
principles, curtailment of democratic principles of perestroika and
finally to establishment of a cruel totalitarian regime.''
   It cited Monday's report in the Supreme Soviet legislature,
broadcast on television, of a police investigation of an alleged
attack on Yeltsin's life.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the deputies Yeltsin
appeared at the police station late the night of Sept. 28 and said
unidentified men had assaulted him and thrown him off a bridge into
the Moscow River.
   Bakatin said Yeltsin then asked officers to tell no one about
the incident, but that they were duty-bound to report it,
``especially since they had a waterlogged man'' as evidence.
   An investigation determined Yeltsin could not have fallen 50
feet into shallow water without injury, Bakatin said, and Yeltsin
said Sept. 30 that no attack occurred.
   In the Supreme Soviet, the working legislature within the
Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin said he had not filed a
written complaint and there had been no attempt on his life. He did
not address whether he had appeared at a police post soaking wet.
   Gorbachev summed up the discussion by saying Yeltsin told the
Supreme Soviet Presidium he had been joking and the police
misunderstood him.
   Adding to the mystery is the fact that Yeltsin disappeared from
both legislative and public view for two weeks. He reappeared at a
rally Sunday and said he had been suffering from a cold.

   By smell and sound, dogs and technicians
searched Wednesday for the last possible survivors of the killer
Bay Quake, and Californians by the thousands picked their way
through glass-strewn streets in search of a semblance of normal
life.
   Across San Francisco Bay in Oakland, hopes faded for finding
anyone alive within the tons of steel and concrete left when
Tuesday's earthquake brought one level of Interstate 880 down atop
another.
   More than 250 people were feared entombed in that twisted
wreckage, and at least 18 others were dead elsewhere in the quake
area. Some 650 people were injured, said state emergency services
spokesman John Peterson.
   ``To the best of our knowledge now, there are not any people
still alive on this freeway,'' said Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson
said of the collapsed roadway.
   Searchers had been hindered by darkness and the condition of the
wrecked freeway, which Acting Oakland City Manager Craig Kocian
described as ``a house of cards'' that could collapse further at
any time unless rescuers work carefully.
   The 1\ miles of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed was one of
oldest in the area, built in 1950s, and apparently was not included
in a program to make spans earthquake-proof, said state
Transportation Department spokesman Kyle Nelson.
   In just 15 seconds, the earthquake destroyed or damaged hundreds
of buildings along 100 miles of the San Andreas Fault, collapsed a
section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and two spans near
Santa Cruz, cracked roads, and severed gas and power lines,
sparking fires.
   The temblor, the nation's second-deadliest, surpassed only by
the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale and was felt 350 miles away.
   Even as residents and officials tried to evaluate the damage,
President Bush signed a disaster declaration making federal funds
available for recovery, and said ``we will take every step and make
every effort'' to help.
   The president said he probably would fly to the area for a
personal inspection but left open when that might happen. Vice
President Dan Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
toured the quake-ravaged area by helicopter Wednesday.
   The federal government normally pays at least 75 percent of the
cost of rebuilding bridges and public facilities that are
destroyed, and provides low-cost loans. The order covered seven
counties.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a center in
Washington and was trying to determine whether the relief order
should be expanded.
   Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said damage was ``the better part of $1
billion.'' Other estimates were in the billions in San Francisco
alone.
   Gov. George Deukmejian headed home from a trade mission to West
Germany.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where a fire fueled by gas
destroyed a block of 12 apartment buildings, about 500 people
packed a cafeteria at Marina Middle School for breakfast after
spending the night on cots and mats.
   Deputy Fire Chief Mike K. Farrell said he strongly suspected
people were trapped in collapsed buildings. ``We're going to bring
in dogs to see if people are trapped in there. I saw three- and
four-story buildings that are now one-story buildings.''
   Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect any sounds of
people trapped alive in rubble, said Scott Shafer, a spokesman for
Mayor Art Agnos. Nine people are known dead and ``I expect we'll
find more bodies,'' he said.
   State Sen. Milton Marks of San Francisco estimated damage in the
Marina area alone at $1 billion. Shafer said damage throughout the
city would run into the billions.
   The transportation system was crippled by the closing of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and Agnos urged commuters to stay
home Wednesday.
   Tourist ferries that helped Tuesday by giving commuters free
rides to Oakland charged the normal $4 on Wednesday. The Oakland
and San Francisco International airports reopened and BART, the
rapid transit system, was open.
   Virginia Rose, one of about 400 people who spent the night at an
emergency Red Cross center, said, ``I have antiques, silver and
nice things. But when you really get down to it _ and I never
thought I'd feel this way _ these things don't matter. The material
things do not make life.''
   About 50 volunteers worked at the shelter and more walked in to
offer their services Wednesday morning. ``People have been
wonderful. We had an incredible community response,'' said Marian
Richie, a volunteer Red Cross nurse.
   Students from the University of San Francisco visited the
shelter Tuesday night to ask what was needed, went back to campus
and returned with food, cots and blankets, Richie said. ``It's an
absolute grass-roots response. I've never seen anything like it.
People come up and say, `How can I help?'''
   It looked like a Sunday afternoon in San Francisco's financial
district, with little visible damage, though many buildings were
closed. A sign on the International Building on California Street _
the equivalent of New York's Wall Street _ said, ``Building closed!
No power. No exceptions!''
   More than 1 million people lost electricity, including the
financial district office of Merrill Lynch, where operations
manager Joe Centis said he arrived at 5:30 a.m. and found wire room
operator Tom Begley using a power-safe phone to call in orders that
came in Tuesday after the New York market closed.
   Officials said power in San Francisco would be restored
Wednesday.
   In Oakland, people picked their way to work through broken glass
and broken buildings Wednesday. Employees of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, like others, waited outside their office while engineers
inspected it.
   ``If they let us in, we'll be lucky,'' said Judy Colwell, who
suffered a bone bruise on her arm during the quake. Water from a
broken main still dripped from light fixtures on a third floor
overhang of the building's facade.
   Ironworkers at a high-rise under construction near I-880 were on
standby to help untangle the wreckage of the highway. The
building's temporary floors were askew and the workers' elevator
had fallen and lay embedded in the pavement.
   ``We put it up, so we're going to have to go up and straighten
it up,'' Jim Osburn said of the building. ``It's always more
dangerous to take it down than it is to take it up, but somebody
will have to go up there and make it safe.''
   While some people arrived for work, others were finishing a long
night.
   ``I've been out here since 7 o'clock,'' said Randy Rogers, one
of three men shoveling fist-sized chunks of fallen masonry into a
pickup truck.
   Red Cross volunteers began house-hunting for evacuees who spent
the night in cafeterias and gymnasiums. ``Hopefully we'll have them
all out in a couple of days,'' said Tekoa King, a Red Cross nurse.

<HEAD>Administration Abandons Bush's `Attempted Genocide' Statement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration said Wednesday its
opposition to a Senate proposal to mark the Turkish mass killing of
Armenians earlier this century did not contradict President Bush's
campaign pledge to acknowledge the ``attempted genocide.''
   ``It isn't causing me any trouble,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said when asked about the apparent
contradiction.
   She said the administration hopes Congress ``can respond to the
concerns of the Armenian people in a manner that does not gravely
offend our vital ally and friend, the Republic of Turkey.''
   The measure, sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, would designate April 24, 1990, as a day to mark the
``Armenian genocide.'' It has angered Turkey because of its
reference to ``genocide,'' which Turkey says falsely compares it
with Nazi Germany.
   Turkey claims hundreds of thousands of Armenians, not 1.5
million, died from war, famine and epidemics from 1915 to 1923.
   In October 1988, Bush used the term ``attempted genocide'' in
response to a questionnaire from an Armenian group.
   ``The United States must acknowledge the attempted genocide of
the Armenian people in the last years of the Ottoman Empire based
on the testimony of survivors, scholars, and indeed our own
representatives at the time,'' he said.
   Tutwiler said that despite the ``tragic suffering of the
Armenian people and the need to commemorate the victims of the
period 1915 to 1923, we are equally mindful of our close
relationship and strong friendship with Turkey and of the differing
views of how the terrible events of that period should properly be
characterized.''
   The resolution cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday
and has gone to the Senate floor.

   The science of predicting earthquakes is
still largely an exercise in probabilities, with little warning
possible when disaster is actually about to strike.
   ``It's difficult to make short-term predictions,'' said Robert
Wesson, chief of the Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and
Engineering at the U.S. Geological Survey, when asked if there were
warning signs of Tuesday's disastrous earthquake in Northern
California.
   ``I would say there was a successful long-term prediction,'' he
said, pointing out that a USGS report last year listed the region
as a likely site for a major tremor. ``Unfortunately we didn't have
any warning of this earthquake last night.''
   Sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake, and that may
have happened in this case too _ although too far removed to make
any short-term prediction. A quake estimated at 5.1 on the Richter
scale occurred on June 27, 1988, and another rated at 5.2 struck on
Aug. 8 of this year.
   Those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to
the Loma Prieta region and notify California officials. But little
could be done beyond that because there was no way to tell if the
tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on their own.
   Using historical records, measurements of ground motion and
other analyses, scientists are able to single out places where they
believe tremors will strike.
   Such predictions ``are not useful in evacuating dangerous
buildings, but they are useful in land use planning and resource
allocation in anticipation of future events,'' said Wesson.
   In addition to the region that was struck on Tuesday, the nearby
Hayward fault has been identified as a likely site for a serious
quake and an even stronger tremor seems probable for the Southern
California portion of the San Andreas Fault, the same one that
moved this time.
   Whether this quake will trigger other major ones remains to be
seen, however.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the Survey, explained
that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that
builds up over time. When this movement releases stress in one area
the strain can be increased elsewhere.
   In California the San Andreas fault is the major problem region,
marking the spot where two of the giant plates that make up the
Earth's crust are moving alongside one another.
   Several miles below the surface the pressure and heat make the
rocks like plastic and they can slip past one another, Russ
explained. But the cooler surface rocks grind and lock together.
   Over time strain builds up until the surface rocks slip in an
earthquake, moving to catch up with the deep layers below, Russ
said.
   Such a movement always triggers thousands of smaller aftershocks
as the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves, and there
remains the chance of strong aftershocks, he said.

   The West's efforts to withhold
sensitive technology from the Soviet Union have hurt the country's
economy, the Soviet ambassador to the European Community said
Wednesday.
   Vladimir Shemiatenkov, the Kremlin's first ambassador to the
trading bloc, said the Western panel that screens high-tech sales
to the Soviet Union is ``obsolete nowadays, it is very clear.''
   Shemiatenkov said the restrictions hinder the Soviet Union's
efforts to reach a trade agreement with the 12-nation European
Economic Community.
   The United States and 15 of its allies belong to the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, which
controls products that could contribute to the military might of
the West's adversaries.
   Some Western nations believe the restrictions should be eased
with the warming of relations between East and West.
   Shemiatenkov said the high-tech restrictions have not
``prevented us from developing advanced military techniques, but in
order to achieve that level we had to allocate much greater
resources (to defense) than otherwise.
   ``But at the same time, it was a very powerful factor in
disfiguring our internal development and I think in constraining
the development of international trade,'' he said.
   Because of the barriers, he said, some Western companies have
been unable to sell telecommunications equipment to the Soviet
Union to help improve the ``exceptionally weak'' phone system.
   However, Shemiatenkov said Moscow was ``very satisfied with
progress'' overall in negotiating the trade agreement with the
European trading bloc.
   The accord would be the fourth between the community and an East
bloc country since a thaw in relations a little more than a year
ago. The trading bloc recently signed a pact with Poland after
earlier arrangements with Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   ``For many years, we have more or less underestimated the impact
of the West European integration,'' said Shemiatenkov.
   Community officials have suggested the negotiations with Moscow
could be wrapped up by year's end but Shemiatenkov would not make a
prediction.
   He confirmed the sides were at odds over the community's
insistence on considering the Soviet Union a state trading country
rather than a market. The European Community is able to impose
price restrictions on imports of state trading countries.
   Shemiatenkov said the description was a ``major problem (for)
our integration to the world economy.'' He said it could require
the government to set export prices at artificially low levels so
they would not create disadvantages for other community trading
partners.
   ``The situation with the Soviet Union today is such that the
government does not ... control prices in (foreign) transactions,''
he said.
   To do so now, officials would have to ``reverse the situation
(and) reinstitute the government control over prices,'' he said.
   ``This is outright fantasy ... It would be contrary to the very
spirit of our reform because we want to have decentralization,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Cuba Elected To Security Council, First Time Since Revolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Cuba was elected to the Security Council on
Wednesday for the first time since Fidel Castro's guerrillas from
the Sierra Maestra took over the country in 1959.
   Diplomats said election to the most powerful U.N. body was a
sign of the increasing respectability and importance of the
Caribbean communist nation, which still is subject to a U.S. trade
embargo.
   The United States did not openly oppose the choice of Cuba as
the Latin American council delegate. It expressed hope the Cubans
would act constructively on the council and called on them to
respect the Central American peace accords and not interfere in
regional affairs.
   Castro's Cuba tried for membership on the 15-nation Security
Council once before, in 1979, but was blocked by the United States.
When Cuba was elected in 1956, dictator Fulgencio Batista ruled the
island.
   Cuba and four other non-permanent council members were elected
for two-year terms in a secret General Assembly ballot. Cuba
replaces Brazil. The other new members are the Ivory Coast,
replacing Algeria; Zaire, replacing Senegal; Romania, replacing
Yugoslavia, and South Yemen replacing Nepal.
   All were chosen by consensus of their regional groups.
   Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland and Malaysia, whose terms
expire next year, are the other non-permanant council members. The
permanent members, who have veto power, are the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, China and France.
   Washington consistently has opposed Cuba in international
forums, criticized its human rights record and accused it of
subversion and military involvement in Latin America.
   The State Department said in a statement about Cuba's election:
   ``We hope it will recognize that it has a special responsibility
as a member of the Security Council to act constructively to end
regional conflicts, not contribute to them.
   ``Cuba should bear in mind that the Central American presidents
have asked the U.N. to create a force to ensure that no state
provides support to `irregular forces,' which includes the
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, known as FMLN.
   ``We call upon its government to behave in a manner consistent
with the U.N. Charter and (a resolution) which calls on member
states to `comply with the provisions of the Guatemala agreement,
and of the joint declaration, particularly that regional and
extra-regional governments which either openly or covertly supply
aid to irregular forces or insurrectional movements in the area
immediately halt such aid.'''
   Cuba had competed with Guatemala for the Latin American council
seat, but Guatemala withdrew in May.

   Two hundred Navy Seabees equipped with
backhoes, trench diggers and water storage equipment headed for the
San Francisco area on Wednesday to aid in the quake-relief effort,
as military hospitals in the afflicted region opened their doors to
help wounded civilians, officials said.
   ``The Seabees' specialty is disaster recovery and they will
focus on making repairs to water and sewage lines,'' said Connie
Taylor, a public affairs officer at the Naval Construction Training
Center in Port Hueneme, Calif.
   Other heavy-lift equipment from the Naval Air Station Alemeda
was sent to help recovery efforts at the nearby freeway collapse,
officials said.
   In Washington, Pentagon officials reported that damage at other
military facilities around the San Francisco bay area was
``comparatively minor,'' and consisted primarily of power outages,
broken gas and water lines, and some structural damage to buildings.
   No deaths of military personnel had been reported and injuries
were ``relatively few and minor,'' a statement said.
   In response to a request from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, a C-141 transport plane was set to carry some 27,000 pounds
of FEMA equipment and 12 FEMA employees to San Francisco, the
statement added.
   Maj. Gen. Todd P. Graham, the deputy commanding general of the
6th Army headquarters at the Presidio in San Francisco, was named
the disaster control officer on the scene, the Pentagon said.
   Injured quake victims were being treated at the Letterman Army
Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in
Oakland, where 100 beds were made available. Fort Ord, near
Monterey, was providing blood, the Pentagon said.
   Navy medical spokesman Lt. Dallas Swenson said 12 civilians had
been admitted to the hospital in Oakland and two of them had
arrived in serious condition.
   The 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron from Portland,
Ore., sent 21 para-rescue jumpers, two physicians, two rescue
helicopters and a communications van to the quake area aboard a
HC-130 transport plane, the Pentagon said.
   About 20 military police from the Army base at the Presidio,
located near the Golden Gate bridge, were helping local police
control traffic.
   The Navy said a pier buckled at the Naval Air Station in
Alemeda, causing two minor injuries.

   President Bush on Wednesday named the chairman
of the Aluminum Company of America, Paul O'Neill, to head a newly
created committee that will advise him on education policy.
   The Education Policy Advisory Committee, which has no other
members yet, will advise the president on the objectives and
content of education policy and recommend ways that federal and
local governments, as well as the private sector, can improve
education.
   The committee, as announced by Bush earlier this year, will have
from 12 to 20 members.
   Bush said he chose O'Neill as chairman of the education panel
because ``he is deeply concerned about helping to bring quality
education to all Americans.'' He mentioned a program at Alcoa to
help improve the literacy of its employees.
   Bush made the announcement in remarks to the National
Association of Elementary School Principals.

<HEAD>HUD Seeks $700,000 From Project Involving Reagan Adviser; Reviews
Another</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development is seeking to recover about $700,000 from a former
Reagan campaign adviser and his partners in a Georgia project and
also has a dispute with the group over another development, a HUD
official said Wednesday.
   The decision to ask the partnership to forfeit about $700,000 is
a reversal of an unusual decision made earlier this year at HUD
headquarters that has piqued the interest of congressional
investigators reviewing allegations of political favoritism at HUD
during the Reagan administration.
   The department now will seek repayment from the owners of the
Cypress Mill Plantation in Brunswick, Ga., including Edward
Weidenfeld, legal counsel to Reagan's 1980 campaign and an adviser
to his 1984 re-election effort.
   Neil Zittrauer, HUD's housing chief in Atlanta, said he hoped to
reach agreement with the owners on the Brunswick project and would
consider legal action if he can't.
   Weidenfeld, a Washington attorney, declined comment when
contacted at his office.
   HUD auditors questioned more than $750,000 of the project's
costs, alleging that a construction company in which two of the
partners were principals was not entitled to some profits and
overhead it received and that the partners had not invested enough
of their own money.
   But R. Hunter Cushing, a deputy undersecretary at HUD
headquarters, earlier this year reduced the amount to $88,000.
   ``It just came out of nowhere,'' Zittrauer said of Cushing's
decision. ``It obviously was the result of some meeting between the
developers and people at headquarters.''
   Cushing left HUD when the Bush administration took office and
was named to a Commerce Department post. But he resigned that job
after he refused to testify before the congressional review. Three
other former agency officials, including former HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, also have refused to testify.
   Zittrauer said he was informed by C. Austin Fitts, the
department's new assistant secretary for housing, that she
supported the results of the audit and that the money should be
recovered. ``They apparently realized that what we had done was
consistent with department guidelines and policies,'' he said.
   If recovered, some of the money will be returned to the federal
government, some to the project for operating expenses and some to
the city of Brunswick, which gave the developers a grant, Zittrauer
said.
   The second dispute with the partnership involves a Savannah
project, Plantation Oaks, and also involves, among other things,
questionable costs submitted by the construction company involving
the partners, Zittrauer said. He said a HUD has not made a final
decision on how much to contest in this case and said the dispute
would be easier to resolve because there are reserve and other
accounts from which HUD could recover money.

<HEAD>Government Announces Measures to Hold Down Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a mounting budget deficit, the
new Solidarity-led government Wednesday announced plans to cut
military spending and reduce subsidies to the coal industry.
   Deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Misiag said the government also
planned to begin selling state treasury bonds which in the future
could be converted into ownership shares of state-run industries
that become private.
   The government is considering shifting resources such as food
and medicine currently allocated to the military and interior
ministries to the civilian sector. Misiag said direct cuts would
also be made in both ministries.
   However, the deputy finance minster, speaking at a news
conference, said he could not immediately specify the size of the
military cutbacks. Last year, the Defense Ministry budget was about
$365 million.
   Misiag said the changes in coal subsidies alone, effective Nov.
1, could result in an annual savings to the government of up to
$571 million. The sales of bonds could raise $380 million.
   Because coal subsidies are to be reduced, Misiag said the price
of energy, including hot water and central heating, will have to be
increased for consumers.
   The government has taken no final decisions yet, but Misiag said
that the increases in energy prices would be in the range of 140
percent.
   Without being specific, Misiag said the level of subsidies to
the coal industry until the end of the year would be maintained at
a level that covers the cost of coal extraction and allows ``a
certain profitability.''
   He said radical transformations in the organization of the coal
mining sectors were planned in the future.
   The budget deficit currently is $2.32 billion and the government
said it would reach $4.38 billion by the end of the year if it did
nothing to save money and meet the current level of obligations.
   The goal of the cutbacks is to reduce the deficit to $2.2
billion by the end of the year.
   The Solidarity government inherited the unbalanced budget Sept.
12 when it assumed responsibility as the first non-communist
government in the East bloc. It has been seeking ways to control
spending ever since.
   The budget gap is considered one of the main engines fueling
rocketing inflation, which was running at an annual rate of 600
percent in August.
   On Monday, in an attempt to slow the flow of money, Parliament
passed curbs on automatic wage increases.
   The government said some limit on pay increases was needed to
reign in soaring inflation.

<HEAD>Co-ops' Share of Commodity Marketings Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department report said
Wednesday that the share of commodity marketings by farm
cooperatives has declined from levels of the early 1980s.
   In 1987, the most recent year examined, co-ops accounted for 25
percent of farm marketings, down from 27 percent in 1985 and 28
percent in 1982.
   Grain marketings by cooperatives were reported at 29 percent of
the total, down from 33 percent in 1985 and 36 percent in 1982.
That includes sales of oilseeds except cottonseed.
   ``Much of the decline has been the result of less cooperative
involvement in grain and oilseeds marketing,'' said the report by
the department's Agricultural Cooperative Service.
   The co-op share of milk marketed was 76 percent in 1987,
compared with 78 percent in 1985 and 77 percent in 1982. Cotton
marketings were 38 percent, 33 percent and 36 percent,
respectively, and livestock 7 percent, 8 percent and 11 percent.
   Fruit and vegetable marketings by co-ops accounted for 23
percent of the total in 1987, up from 8 percent in 1985 and 11
percent in 1982.
   Cooperative shares of production supplies sold to farmers also
dropped by similar percentages, to 25 percent in 1987 from 27
percent in 1985 and 28 percent in 1982, the report said. However,
not all items declined accordingly.
   Supplies included: fertilizer, 43 percent of the total in 1987,
44 percent in 1985 and 42 percent in 1982; petroleum, 37 percent,
44 percent and 36 percent; farm chemicals, 28 percent; 29 percent
and 34 percent; seed, 19 percent, 15 percent and 17 percent; and
feed, 17 percent, 16 percent and 18 percent.

<HEAD>Report: Federal Agencies Need to Do More to Keep Senior Executives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agencies should do more to alleviate
the non-monetary reasons that senior executives cite when
explaining why they left government work, the Merit Systems
Protection Board said Wednesday.
   At the same time, it said, lack of adequate pay remains the most
commonly cited reason why members of the Senior Executive Service
decide to leave government work.
   The board released the results of a questionnaire survey of 956
senior executives who left government over a 5{ year period ending
June 30, 1988.
   The ceiling on Senior Executive Service salaries _ currently
$80,700 a year _ was among reasons for leaving given by 57 percent
of those responding to the survey, according to a summary of the
findings.
   It said the average private-sector salary of former senior
executives who continued to work, either part time or full time,
was $101,152.
   But the report said non-monetary reasons also were frequently
cited by the executives who decided to leave government. Among them:
   _48 percent left, in part, because they believe the SES is not
being administered in a fashion which protects senior executives
from improper political interference;
   _46 percent left, in part, because they no longer enjoyed their
jobs;
   _42 percent left, in part, because their knowledge and skills
had not been used appropriately; and
   _38 percent left, in part, because of the incompetence of their
immediate supervisors.
   The board's report noted that ``agencies expend considerable
effort in selecting the most qualified candidates for career
positions in the Senior Executive Service. They should expend more
effort in attempting to retain them.''
   ``Agencies cannot force the political process to establish
adequate SES compensation,'' it said. ``Nor can agencies prevent
executives who have earned the right to retire from doing so.
However, agencies can work to reduce SES turnover by attempting to
alleviate non-monetary causes of SES dissatisfaction.''
   The Merit Systems Protection Board is an independent,
quasi-judicial agency with responsibility for deciding federal
employee appeals from personnel actions taken against them.
   As a part of its mission, the board is responsible for
conducting studies of the civil service and other merit systems and
for reviewing actions of the Office of Personnel Management.

   Striking United Mine Workers set aside 2{
months of hostility to rescue three non-union coal company workers
whose van slid down a hillside into a flooding creek, state police
said Wednesday.
   ``We really hate these guys, but we couldn't let them die,''
striking miner James Justice said Wednesday. ``We don't like them.
We don't want to kill them, though.''
   Three men who went to work in August for Con-Serv Inc., a
non-union company hired by A.T. Massey Coal Co. to operate its Rum
Creek Coal Sales tipple, where coal is loaded into trucks, were
headed home after Tuesday's day shift.
   High water from Rum Creek blocked the normal road leading away
from the Logan County operation, and they got stuck.
   Another Con-Serv employee in a four-wheel-drive truck hooked a
chain to the van to pull it loose and was towing it along an
alternate exit road leading up a steep hillside when the van
lurched sideways and fell 75 feet into Rum Creek.
   ``The water probably cushioned their fall,'' Justice said.
   Witnesses said about eight UMW men who also were blocked by the
high water were following the truck and van up the hill when the
accident occurred. All jumped out of their cars and helped the
three escape from the rising water.
   One of the workers, Rodney Walker of Cincinnati, was trapped
with his foot pinned in the van, said state police Trooper Ric
Robinson.
   The UMW men held Walker's head above the rising water while
waiting for emergency workers to arrive, said state police Sgt.
G.A. Ables.
   ``Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' Ables
said. ``He could not have extricated himself from that vehicle
himself.''
   Justice is a Pittston Coal Group employee who has been on strike
since April. He and others throughout southern West Virginia and
Kentucky have picketed Pittston and other non-union operations
since.
   ``We don't want to see anyone killed over this,'' he said. ``We
don't want nobody hurt. We just don't want anybody taking our
jobs.''
   Walker and the other workers, plus one of the UMW men, were
treated at Man Appalachian Regional Hospital for cuts and bruises
and released, Robinson said.
   ``Yesterday was a little common human bonding,'' said Ables.
``Today they'll be hating each other again. They'll be fighting up
there again this evening.''
   Seven company workers are charged with attempted murder in the
shooting of a UMW demonstrator in August, and six pickets have been
charged with rock throwing, according to the Logan County
Magistrate's office.
   When the UMW members arrived back at their picket shack, some
were subjected to razzing and told they should have let the
replacement workers, known in picket-line taunting as scabs, drown.
   ``You don't know what to do until you're in the situation,''
said Andrew Perry, another Pittston employee on the Massey picket
line.
   ``Sitting around and watching a man drown, now that's cruel.''
   A UMW official said the rescue was not unusual.
   ``I'm not surprised, because that's just the kind of people we
are,'' said Danny Wells, a local board member of UMW District 17.
``We hate what's going on up there, but any time you see someone
that's in trouble, that's the immediate response of the United Mine
Workers.''
   Elsewhere in southern West Virginia, and in neighboring eastern
Kentucky, heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry produced
flooding that blocked roads, closed schools and forced some people
to evacuate. The Tug Fork River overflowed its banks by 6 feet
Tuesday night in low-lying areas of Matewan. The river at
Williamson crested about 3 feet above flood stage.

   The State Department condemned on Wednesday
the slaying in El Salvador of the 23-year old daughter of a
military officer, suggesting that leftist rebels were responsible.
   ``This was not a political act, but murder pure and simple,''
said department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   While not directly accusing the FMLN guerrillas, Ms. Tutwiler
said the rebel group ``has become known'' for this type of crime.
   She blamed the FMLN for the recent slaying of the wife and son
of a conservative newspaper editor and for killing eight Salvadoran
Army recruits three weeks ago.
   The governments of Nicaragua and Cuba have supplied the FMLN
with the weapons and training to conduct this continuing reign of
terror, and they bear responsibility for these crimes, Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   ``The FMLN tells the press that such barbarities are
unauthorized by the guerrilla command. In fact, the assassination
teams are trained, equipped, and directed by the FMLN command,''
she said.

   The city of Charleston, still digging
out from last month's pounding by Hurricane Hugo, on Wednesday set
up a relief fund and dispatched a planeload of bottled water for
earthquake victims in California.
   ``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
``However, it would be wrong for this community ... not to reach in
and contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
   An Air Force C-141 transport plane carrying a cargo of fresh
water also took Charleston Police Chief Reuben Greenberg and
several of his officers to Northern California to help with
emergency operations.
   In addition, the city has set up a California Earthquake
Disaster Relief Fund to raise money for victims of the disaster.
   After Hurricane Hugo slammed into Charleston with 135 mph winds
on Sept. 21, relief poured into the city from across the nation.
   ``We realized the extraordinary help that (the relief) gave us
and made a commitment that if ever another community in the United
States ... was hit with a disaster, we would want to respond,''
Riley said.

   Soviet legislators were barred on Wednesday from
defending a daring newspaper editor President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
wants dismissed, one deputy reported.
   Nikolai A. Kutsenko, a lawmaker from the Ukraine, said the group
will submit a petition signed by 34 legislators charging Gorbachev
with using ``pressure tactics'' that contradict his own reforms.
   Kutsenko said Supreme Soviet leaders would not permit the
defense of Vladislav A. Starkov, editor of the weekly Arguments and
Facts, because they viewed his case as a matter for the Communist
Party rather than the government.
   Starkov's tabloid has been at the forefront of Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness.
   Kutsenko said he wanted to speak for Starkov on Wednesday but
was told he could not have the floor by Gorbachev's hand-picked
vice president, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, and the chairmen of the
legislature's two houses, Rafik N. Nishanov and Yevgeny M. Primakov.
   The petition he hoped to read accuses Gorbachev of trying to
discredit Arguments and Facts. Kutsenko said Lukyanov also refused
to recognize him on Tuesday.
   Gorbachev lashed out at selected editors at a closed Communist
Party meeting Friday. He apparently was trying to regain some
control over the press, which has carried daily reports criticizing
the system and sometimes its leaders.
   Journalists, quoting their bosses who attended and asking not to
be identified, said Gorbachev accused Starkov and others of seeking
his political downfall.
   Yegor Yakovlev, chief editor of the weekly Moscow News, wrote in
the current issue Wednesday that Gorbachev said the country was
``at the peak of tension,'' with passions flaring over economic
crisis and ethnic strife.
   He blamed the press for warning of famine, a coup or plot and
accused it of offering anti-communist views, demanding instead that
the press make a sober analysis of events, Yakovlev's article said.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov called Wednesday for
journalists around the world to stand up for Starkov.
   In an interview Wednesday, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate
also urged the Supreme Soviet to strip the Communist Party of its
constitutional monopoly on power. He called it an anachronism.
   Most lawmakers appeared to dismiss the idea.
   Journalists, speaking on condition of anonymity, said top
broadcast officials barred Sakharov at the last minute from
appearing live on last Friday's popular television show, Vzglyad.
   Also on Wednesday, the Supreme Soviet gave preliminary approval
to a bill that would give local governing councils more power to
control the economies in their areas. It would also give the
councils, known as soviets, the power to levy local income taxes.

<HEAD>House Won't Go Along with Slimmer Deficit-Cut Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House refused Wednesday to endorse a
slimmed-down deficit-reduction bill that includes a cut in the
capital-gains tax but no improvement in child-care benefits.
   The non-binding 228-181 vote was against a Republican motion
that would have instructed House negotiators to strip from the
deficit bill virtually all spending increases and tax reductions.
   However, the bill would have retained provisions repealing
catastrophic medical protection for retirees and wiping out a law
requiring that employer-paid health insurance not discriminate
against lower-paid workers.
   ``It is hard for us to conceive of a budget bill fatter than
this one,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican
on the House Budget Committee, in arguing for the motion to trim
the measure.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, accused Republicans of talking from both sides of
their mouths by arguing for a leaner bill while insisting on repeal
of the two health-insurance provisions.
   Rostenkowski accused President Bush of sitting on the sidelines
in the budget fight _ ``content to provide absolutely no leadership
on real deficit reduction'' _ leaving his top advisers to ``the
collective pursuit of short-term gratification ... (and) pursuing
shallow political victories and bankrupt budget policies.''
   Rostenkowski's remarks were aimed at Bush's insistence that
taxes on capital gains be cut. The House voted last month for such
a cut over opposition from Democratic leaders.
   Negotiators from the Senate and House will work out a compromise
between the competing deficit-reduction plans passed by the two
chambers.
   The Senate bill is a lean version that contains neither the
capital-gains reduction nor repeal of the health provisions.
   The House approved those three items in the bill by lopsided
margins. Thus, it would be difficult for House negotiators to drop
them from the final compromise unless given assurances that they
could be added to some other bill later this year.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Lawmakers Urge Ouster of Hastings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker active in the civil rights movement
urged the Senate on Wednesday to remove Judge Alcee L. Hastings
from the bench, saying Florida's first black federal judge
``betrayed'' his position of leadership.
   ``There have been a lot or cases in our judicial system in which
race has been a problem,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., as
final arguments began in the Senate impeachment trial. ``This isn't
one of them or I would be the first to tell you so.''
   ``We did not wage the civil rights struggle in order to trade
one form of judicial corruption for another,'' Conyers said. He
said a federal judgeship entailed trust and Hastings had ``betrayed
that strust and betrayed those who looked to him for leadership.''
   House members act as prosecutors in such proceedings. If the
Senate votes to remove Hastings from office, he would be the sixth
federal official to be removed in such a fashion.
   Hastings, 53, is accused of conspiring to obtain a $150,000
payoff and lying to a federal jury that acquitted him of it five
years ago. The Senate heard closing arguments in the case on
Wednesday.
   The Senate plans to deliberate the evidence behind closed doors
on Thursday and later vote on whether to remove him from the bench.
   Hastings, taking the Senate floor, once again denied that he had
taken part in a payoff plot.
   ``I am not guilty of having committed any crime _ that is my
defense,'' Hastings said. ``Please act fairly.''
   Hastings disputed a statement by Conyers that race would be at
the core of his defense. Hastings had, however, told a news
conference only a day earlier that he would not have been awaiting
removal from office if he had been white.
   The House prosecutors urged the Senate to ignore Hastings'
acquittal in 1983, saying he lied. They also dismissed defense
complaints that the impeachment trial is a second trial for
Hastings, violating the prohibition against double jeopardy.
   Hastings would be removed as a judge immediately upon conviction
by the Senate on any one of the 17 articles of impeachment approved
by the House.
   Conviction would not only remove Hastings from the federal bench
but also halt payment of the $89,500 judicial salary that he
continues to collect.

<HEAD>New Anti-Rejection Drug More Effective Than Cyclosporine in Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug believed 50 to 100 times more
powerful in preventing organ rejection might cut transplant costs
and ease critical shortages of donor organs, doctors said Wednesday.
   ``The biggest bonus is better survival,'' said Dr. Thomas E.
Starzl, head of the University of Pittsburgh's transplant program.
   Starzl heads the world's only clinical trials of the Japanese
drug FK-506. As of Wednesday, 111 transplant patients had received
the experimental medication, including a few children.
   FK-506 is far more effective and safer than cyclosporine, the
major anti-rejection drug now being used, Starzl said. He estimated
it to be 50 to 100 times more potent.
   ``Although we are idolaters of cyclosporine and have been, in
fact, one of the prime developers of cyclosporine, we've always
realized its limitations practically from week two onward,'' Starzl
said at a news conference.
   ``There's a prospect now of doing things that couldn't be done
previously'' such as intestinal transplants and, ultimately,
cross-species transplants, Starzl said.
   The new drug shows promise in treating certain liver diseases,
thus eliminating the need for a transplant, said Dr. David Van
Thiel, medical director of transplantation at the University of
Pittsburgh. It also holds promise for treating rheumatoid
arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other disorders impairing the
immune system.
   Dr. Robert Corry, president of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, said he has not yet reviewed the findings but has ``every
reason to believe that Dr. Starzl is correct.''
   The drug's potential became apparent within only eight months of
use on humans.
   ``We're shocked by it because it went so fast. It was like
throwing a gasoline bomb,'' said Starzl, who will report his
findings in an upcoming edition of the British medical journal
Lancet and at a scientific meeting Oct. 31 in Spain.
   Starzl performed the world's first liver transplant in 1963 and
pioneered the use of cyclosporine in the early 1980s. He first
tried FK-506 on a patient in February.
   Of the 111 patients, 102 have been liver recipients, said Dr.
John Fung, a Starzl colleague. The rest have been heart, kidney,
pancreas and lung recipients.
   With cyclosporine, the one-year success rate of liver
transplants has been 75 percent to 80 percent, a rate that could
rise to nearly 100 percent with FK-506, Starzl said. The new drug
also might lessen the need for two or more transplants in a single
patient, freeing organs for other recipients.
   ``It really wasn't much of a decision'' to try FK-506, said
Henry Weber, 37, of Watertown, N.Y., one of the patients who used
the drug. ``I knew what the effects of cyclosporine were for the
long run.''
   Of the approximately 40 patients who started immediately on
FK-506 without having received cyclosporine, none needed a second
transplant or had kidney failure, a leading side effect of
cyclosporine.
   FK-506 could reduce the cost of a liver transplant, which now
exceeds $200,000, by more than one-third because of speedier
recovery and less need for blood tests to monitor the drug's
effectiveness.
   ``Theoretically, it should improve the donor supply in that
people might be more accepting of transplantation with much better
results,'' Corry said.
   As of Monday, 18,453 people were awaiting organ transplants in
the United States, the network said. There were 12,798 organ
transplants performed in the nation last year.
   Researchers assume FK-506, like other anti-rejection drugs, will
increase patients' risk of getting cancer. That risk, however,
probably will not be enough ``to cancel the effect and usefulness
of this drug,'' Starzl said.
   While FK-506 causes nausea, stomach pains and headaches during
the first few days when the drug is administered intravenously,
those side effects virtually disappear once oral treatment begins.
Most patients take the drug daily, but a few need it just once
every three days and one person only once a week. Most
anti-rejection drugs must be taken for life.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants to consider the drug
further before determining whether to allow wider use of it.
FK-506, derived from a fungus found in Japan, is made by Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Osaka.
   Starzl is cautious about proceeding too quickly.
   ``Our fear is we've been so close to the drug and fueled by
hope,'' he said. ``We don't want to be snowballed into this.''

<HEAD>Center Calls For Educating Teen-Agers On AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Center for Population Options on Wednesday
called for massive public education and prevention programs to stem
the rapid spread of AIDS among teen-agers.
   The center said schools, churches, community organizations and
parents must do a better job correcting misinformation about AIDS,
helping teen-agers delay sexual intercourse, ensuring that those
who do have sex use condoms and warning teen-agers about the
dangers of drug use.
   ``Our children have a right to straightforward, accurate
information about HIV infection and how to prevent it,'' said a
report issued by the nonprofit educational center and partially
funded by the Centers for Disease Control.
   The number of AIDS cases among teen-agers jumped by 43 percent
to 398 between July 1988 and July 1989, according to the CDC.
   But because the time between infection and the onset of AIDS can
be as long as 10 years, public health officials believe that many
people with AIDS who are now in their 20s may have picked up the
virus when they were teen-agers.
   The report also says CDC's figures also show that a greater
proportion of adolescents than adults with AIDS is female, 19
percent for teen-agers compared with 9 percent among adults.
   Wanda Wigfall-Williams, director of the center's AIDS programs,
said the figures show that the projected spread of the virus among
heterosexuals ``is becoming a reality among adolescents.''
   The center's report says HIV programs should vary in content and
format depending on the audience intended to be reached. But each
program should emphasize certain basic information, including how
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is transmitted, how it is
not transmitted and how to protect against infection, including
abstaining from sexual intercourse and use of condoms by those who
do have sex.
   But, the report advises, ``simply providing young people with
facts is not enough.'' Correct and precise language should be used
to describe everything from risky sexual practices to proper use of
condoms, the report said.
   The report also suggests that health clinics make condoms
available to young people and that HIV prevention programs
encourage effective condom use by getting teen-agers comfortable
talking about and buying condoms.
   The report, emphasizing the risk of AIDS to teen-agers, cites
studies showing that teen-agers on average begin sexual intercourse
at about age 16 and that each year one in six teen-agers contracts
a sexually-transmitted disease and more than 1 million teen-age
girls become pregnant.
   Drug and alcohol use is also implicated in the spread because
they make it less likely a young person will protect themselves
during sex and, through addiction, often lead to sex in exchange
for money or drugs, the report said.

<HEAD>ANC Leaders Recall Hardships And Triumphs Of 26 Years In Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter Sisulu was mocked by guards,
strip-searched and forced to break rocks in a quarry during 26
years in prison, but news of the struggle against apartheid kept
him from despair.
   ``I never had the feeling I was at the lowest,'' the 77-year-old
African National Congress leader said Wednesday. ``There were
moments I felt very much in high spirits ... every time there was a
movement, a strike'' on the outside.
   Sisulu and two ANC colleagues, Elias Motsoaledi and Ahmed
Kathrada, recalled prison life during an interview at a Soweto
church with American journalists.
   They and senior ANC leader Nelson Mandela were convicted of
planning anti-government sabotage and sentenced to life terms in
1964. Mandela remains in prison, but Sisulu, Motsoaledi, Kathrada
and two others sentenced with them were among eight long-term
political prisoners freed unconditionally Sunday.
   The ANC is the biggest group fighting white domination in South
Africa.
   After their convictions, the ANC leaders were sent to a
maximum-security prison on Robben Island, off Cape Town.
   ``At the early stages, they (guards) went out of their way, as
they openly stated to us, to crush us, to break our morale,'' said
Kathrada, 60. ``They tried to instill into our minds that we would
be forgotten factors in a few years time.''
   He recalled a jailer with a swastika tattoo who said: ``I've
come to fight a war.''
   ``We started off chopping stones, breaking big stones into small
stones and small stones into smaller stones,'' Kathrada said. ``In
1965, we started working at a lime quarry, with picks and shovels.
That continued for 10 years.''
   He and other prisoners of Indian descent, and those of mixed
race, initially were treated better than black prisoners, Kathrada
said. Sisulu and other blacks were forced to wear short pants even
in winter, were not provided with socks and were not given bread,
he told reporters.
   Sisulu said: ``We used to come back from work on very cold days
_ no hot water. We stripped naked outside, then passed through a
cold shower of sea water.''
   At one stage, Sisulu was deprived of solid food for three days
and Mandela for six because prison authorities decided they had not
worked hard enough.
   In May 1971, pro-independence guerrillas from Namibia were
transferred to Robben Island and clashed with guards, Kathrada said.
   ``We embarked on a hunger strike and they decided to punish us
further,'' he said. ``They came one night, many of them very drunk,
and they stripped us all naked. We faced the wall. This was a
simple question of wanting to humiliate and punish us.''
   An older prisoner, Govan Mbeki, almost suffered a heart attack,
Kathrada said, but the hunger strike continued.
   ``We were meeting the oppressor at close hand,'' he said. ``It
helped to keep us united. What kept our morale up was our
confidence in our beliefs ... confidence that we are going to
triumph sooner or later. Of that we had no doubt at any stage.''
   Pressure by prisoners eventually ended the discrimination
between racial groups and won other concessions, including
permission to study and engage in sports, Kathrada said. They were
allowed newspapers in 1980 and radio and television in 1986.
   He expressed gratitude to the International Red Cross and to
Helen Suzman, an opposition member of Parliament who is now
retired, for campaigning on behalf of the prisoners.
   Before the liberalization, Kathrada said, ``political prisoners
gave top priority to keeping themselves informed, in one way or
another _ begging, stealing, buying, bribing. ... We tried to
smuggle in things, too _ letters, visits, just about everything.''
   News often was months late. In 1976, prisoners who arrived in
August told them of the uprising by Soweto schoolchildren in June
that started nationwide unrest.
   Sisulu cited that uprising as one of the most dramatic events of
his imprisonment.
   ``It was inspiring to see the children taking a position, to say
`Thus far and no further _ we're tired of your oppression,''' he
said. ``It boosted our spirits.''
   Motsoaledi, 65, said he learned with shock that three friends of
his children were killed in the aftermath of the June 1976
uprising. He said three of his six children went into exile, like
thousands of other young blacks who supported the African National
Congress.
   Sisulu's family has been hit particularly hard by political
turmoil. His wife, Albertina, is under restrictions; one son is in
jail; another was detained for two years, and two children are in
exile.

<TEXT>
   A maverick Democrat's victory in a
Mississippi congressional race gave the state's House delegation a
one-party look and saddled Republicans with their fifth loss in
seven special elections this year.
   State Sen. Gene Taylor's victory Tuesday over Republican Tom
Anderson gave the state its first all-Democrat House delegation in
17 years.
   ``Gene was just an excellent candidate for this time,'' state
Democratic Chairman Ed Cole said Wednesday. ``But the lesson to the
party is that if you've got a process that's open and fair, the
people will tell you who they want.''
   Taylor, 36, garnered 65 percent of the vote and carried 11 of
the 12 counties in the 5th District, which includes the Gulf Coast.
Anderson, a top aide to Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, was making
his first bid for public office.
   Taylor won 82,855 votes to Anderson's 44,377 in unofficial
totals.
   Taylor, who is to be sworn in next week, will serve 14 months,
succeeding Republican freshman Rep. Larkin Smith, who was killed in
an Aug. 13 plane crash.
   National Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown said Taylor's
election was ``yet another signal that the supposed Republican
realignment in the South does not exist.
   ``This is a district that the Republican Party wanted so
desperately that George Bush personally campaigned for Trent Lott's
handpicked candidate,'' Brown said.
   Democrats had accused Lott of forcing Smith's widow from the
race after she had made public her intention to run. She eventually
backed Anderson.
   ``I think realistically something very American happened,''
Taylor said. ``The citizens chose a candidate rather than the big
power brokers in Washington and the big money interests.''
   The seat had been in GOP hands since Lott won it in 1972. He was
elected to the Senate in 1988.
   Republicans were assessing the loss Wednesday.
   ``I think the long-term ramifications of it are neglible,'' said
Haley Barbour, Republican national committeeman for Mississippi.
   ``Voters vote for who they think is the best candidate. From a
party point of view, it's no surprise,'' he said from Washington.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee, said the GOP's special election
losses this year showed that voters choose Democratic candidates
who ``reject the liberalism of the National Democratic Party.
   ``The candidate who best captures the local agenda is the one
who will win,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wildlife Service Proposes Hunting of Grizzlies Near Yellowstone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
proposed opening the forests surrounding Yellowstone National Park
to limited hunting of grizzly bears that pose threats to people or
livestock.
   The proposal appeared in the Federal Register Tuesday, opening a
60-day public comment period.
   Grizzly bears, a threatened species in the lower 48 states, are
now protected under the federal Endangered Species Act, though
limited hunting is allowed in northwest Montana.
   The Fish and Wildlife proposal, if approved, would allow hunting
of nuisance grizzlies, including those that leave Yellowstone and
Grand Teton national parks, in an area of more than 10 million
acres in the forests of southwest Montana, northwest Wyoming and
eastern Idaho.
   Nuisance grizzlies are defined as those that threaten human
safety, have killed or injured livestock or that ``can't reasonably
be controlled'' by trapping or removal from a location, said a U.S.
Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman in Washington.
   A Wyoming Game and Fish official who helped originate the
proposal said it would merely extend to Wyoming and Idaho the
option granted years ago to Montana in the area around Glacier
National Park.
   Nuisance grizzlies near Yellowstone are now killed by state game
wardens, said John Talbott of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
Talbott is chairman of the Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly bear
subcommittee of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, made up of
state and federal wildlife officials.
   ``What we're looking at is, rather than the agency doing that,
we'll just provide an opportunity for the sportsman to harvest that
bear,'' Talbott said.
   But Michael Scott, a Wilderness Society official in Bozeman,
said the hunt could pose a conflict of interest for wildlife
managers.
   ``This would be an opportunity for the state to make some
money,'' Scott said. He feared biologists could unconsciously
declare a difficult grizzly a nuisance bear so that it could be
hunted and the state would profit.
   ``The whole rationale for allowing a hunt of this type is to
give people the thrill of hunting,'' Scott said Tuesday.
   Talbott said he knew of only one case in the past five years in
which a problem grizzly was killed in Wyoming.
   In Montana, two hunts for nuisance grizzlies have been held in
the past three years near Glacier, and one grizzly was killed, said
Ron Marcoux, deputy director of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in Helena.
   Montana law allows no more than 25 man-caused grizzly deaths a
year. A limited state hunting season along the Northern Rocky
Mountain front extends from Oct. 1 through Nov. 26, and is closed
earlier if the bear toll reaches 25, said Fish, Wildlife and Parks
spokesman Don Bianchi of Bozeman.

<TEXT>
   Former President Ford said Wednesday
his pardon of Richard Nixon was ``absolutely the right thing to
do,'' although the Watergate scandal may have cost him the 1976
election.
   Questioned by 100 schoolchildren about the pardon, Ford said it
was the only way to end national divisions. He said the healing
process after Nixon's resignation as president will be the legacy
of Ford's brief administration.
   ``I was spending 25 percent of my time on the problems of one
man at a time when I should have been spending 100 percent of my
time on the problems of 240 million Americans,'' Ford said.
   ``The only way for me to get rid of the problems of one man was
to pardon Mr. Nixon,'' he said. ``It was absolutely the right
decision. I'm more convinced now than I was then it was the right
thing to do.''
   The Watergate scandal developed well before Ford was appointed
vice president, but he said it was costly to him.
   ``It was a tragedy,'' Ford said. ``I suspect that people voted
against me because of the existence of the Watergate scandal.''
   Ford was questioning by the Iowa children in a Quaker meeting
house on the grounds of the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site.
Earlier Wednesday, he spoke at a forum at the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library on the role former presidents should play in
American government.
   Ford argued against a formal role for ex-presidents. Ford is one
of four living former presidents, who also include Nixon, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan.
   ``Frankly, I don't see the value in formalizing the role of
ex-presidents,'' Ford said. ``Let ex-presidents decide what
interest to pursue, what contributions to make on their own.''
   Ford said he spends his time lecturing on the college circuit,
campaigning for Republican candidates and pursuing business
opportunities.
   Carter and Ford sent President Bush a variety of recommendations
in November 1988, before Bush took office, but Ford said they were
largely ignored. The proposals were intended to help with Bush's
transition from vice president to president.
   ``President Bush made no comment on it and, as far as I know,
none of it has been implemented,'' Ford said. ``I felt an adverse
reaction from his own staff. I was somewhat disappointed.''
   Among the proposals from Ford and Carter were ways to solve the
nation's savings and loan crisis and ways to reduce the federal
deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes on beer, wine,
cigarettes and motor fuel.

<HEAD>West Germany's Honecker Fell Behind New March of Communism</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker rose to power in East Germany after
sealing a workers' exodus to the West by building the Berlin Wall
in 1961. But his deaf ear to public cries for more democracy led to
a second exodus, and he was through.
   Honecker, 77, was removed from leadership Wednesday after 18
years as Communist Party chief.
   He oversaw the building of socialism's strongest economy and a
period of steadily improved relations with both East and West.
   But the short, bespectacled Communist failed to fall in step
with the new march of communism in Eastern Europe.
   The East Berlin government under Honecker defended China's
bloody crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in June, and violent
clashes between security forces and demonstrators were reported in
major East German cities during and after Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's visit Oct. 6-7 to East Berlin.
   When tens of thousands took to the streets of Leipzig to demand
the kinds of reforms sweeping Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union,
Honecker's state media branded them ``hooligans.''
   More than 53,000 others lost faith the system could be changed
under Honecker or his hand-picked successor and fled to West
Germany over the past two months.
   Honecker's health was blamed for his departure. He is known to
have suffered complications from gallbladder surgery this past
summer. West German intelligence reports said he has cancer.
   But his outmoded views of socialist dictates probably inflicted
more damage than any illness.
   Under Honecker, East German border guards for years had orders
to shoot anyone who tried to flee the country. At least 91 people
were shot to death after the Berlin Wall went up in 1961 to cut off
an escape route to the West.
   Honecker, born in what is now West Germany, rejected all
suggestions that the two Germanys be reunited. ``Socialism and
capitalism can be no more united than fire and water,'' he
commented during his historic visit to West Germany in 1987.
   After rising to party leadership in 1971, Honecker adopted a
policy of tolerance toward the Protestant Church and pursued a
brand of ``consumer socialism'' that gave his people the East
bloc's most advanced standard of living. However, the economy lags
far behind that of West Germany and most Western nations.
   Unlike his Stalinist predecessor, Walter Ulbricht, Honecker
showed interest in detente and improved relations with West Germany.
   But his repression of political dissent, his role in building
the Berlin Wall and his maintenance of fortress-like borders with
West Germany signaled the limits of moderation in East Germany.
   Little is known of Honecker's personal life, except he divorced
his first wife to marry Margot Feist, who now is education minister.
   Honecker was born Aug. 25, 1912, in Saarland, and joined a
Communist youth group at age 14.
   The Nazis imprisoned him in 1935 and he didn't get out until the
invading Soviet Red Army arrived a decade later.
   Honecker caught Ulbricht's eye in the fledgling postwar regime
created in 1949 in the Soviet occupation zone of the defeated Third
Reich.
   In 1958, he gained his first powerful government posts, rising
to membership in the ruling Politburo and becoming a Central
Committee secretary with responsibility for state security.
   In 1961, Ulbricht assigned Honecker to direct construction of
the Berlin Wall.
   As late as this year, Honecker said the wall would remain as
long as the reasons for its construction persist _ the loss of
crucial labor capacity to the West.

   Neighbors who had feared for each other's
lives embraced cheerfully Wednesday as they surveyed their ruined
homes, and tourists swapped stories about how they survived the
killer earthquake.
   Neil Hancock comforted Maryellen Sechser, his upstairs neighbor
in what had been a 21-unit apartment building in the Marina
District. The building toppled and caught fire after Tuesday's
quake, and three people were feared dead.
   ``She is the first one I've seen since last night,'' Hancock
said.
   The two stood among a crowd at Divisadero and Beach streets
watching firefighters hose water over the blackened remains of the
building.
   ``When I got here the whole building collapsed. I could see into
my apartment,'' Sechser said, fighting back tears. She watched
helplessly as the flames came up through the floor of her ruined
living room.
   The worst thing was not knowing if her neighbors, many of them
elderly, were all right, she said.
   ``(I thought) people were still in the building. I couldn't save
anyone, I couldn't save the animals, I couldn't save anything,''
Sechser said. ``I lost everything. What you see is all I've got.''
   Sechser went to the Red Cross shelter several blocks away hoping
to find neighbors but saw no one until she found Hancock, who also
had worried about neighbors.
   ``I was standing here all night,'' he said. ``I didn't know who
was dead and who was alive.''
   The destruction brought out hundreds of neighborhood residents
who crowded outside police lines to view the damage. Many took
pictures or continued to talk about where they had been when the
earth began to move.
   Balmy weather contributed to a festive atmosphere on some
streets.
   At the Embarcadero Hyatt Regency hotel, guests like Harley and
Marie Brown of Denver joked about the snoring that kept them awake
in the ballroom, where hundreds of other guests and stranded office
workers slept under tablecloths.
   ``It was just wall-to-wall people,'' Ms. Brown said. ``You could
hardly walk through without stepping on people. People were
laughing because the snoring would get louder and louder.''
   Survivors quickly snatched up local newspapers as souvenirs, and
people on the streets exchanged stories and shared airport
information.
   As Hyatt guests lined up for pay phones to change airline
reservations, others enjoyed an impromptu buffet of boxed cereal,
fruit salad and pastries by candlelight in the hotel's vast but
dimly-lit lobby.
   ``It was really rocking and rolling. It was pretty good,'' Juan
Richardson, a power company worker, said of the quake. ``A lot of
people from New York were wigging out.''
   Most visitors vowed to return to San Francisco despite the
disaster _ and some already were planning return trips.
   ``I was looking real forward to eating Oriental food last night,
and I'm still looking forward to coming back for that dinner,''
said Vernon Rowe of Pittsburg, Texas.

   Aftershocks to Tuesday's killer quake
shook the battered San Francisco Bay area today as work crews gave
up hope of finding anyone alive beneath a wrecked freeway and
stunned Californians struggled to put order back in their lives.
   At least 272 people were reported killed and 1,400 injured in
the catastrophic earthquake, which in 15 seconds wrecked buildings
across nearly 100 miles. A section of the Bay Bridge and at least
two spans near Santa Cruz fell, and electric power was cut for as
many as 1 million residents.
   Severed gas lines touched off fires, including one in San
Francisco that burned a block of buildings, but all the blazes were
out or under control today.
   Extensive damage was reported in parts of Santa Cruz and San
Benito counties 70 miles to the south, which were closest to the
epicenter of the earthquake.
   The quake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was the second-deadliest in
U.S. history, surpassed only by the great San Francisco earthquake
of 1906, when 2,500 or more were killed.
   The magnitude of the disaster emerged slowly today as officials
made contact with hard-hit areas _ outlying suburbs and towns where
many telephones were cut off.
   ``The devastation is just horrible,'' said Gov. George
Deukmejian, who cut short a trade mission to West Germany. Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy said damage would total ``the better part of $1
billion.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos urged commuters to stay home
rather than tax the transportation system, crippled by the closing
of the Bay Bridge. But as dawn spread over the glass-strewn streets
of the region, people tried to revive a sense of normalcy, some
making their way to work by ferry, by foot or over highways not
blocked by damage. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system reopened this
morning, as did the Oakland and San Francisco airports.
   Many people stayed home, however, their workplaces shut down in
the quake's aftermath. Most schools and many other institutions
were closed as well.
   San Francisco's financial district was unusually quiet. The
Pacific Stock Exchange opened, but business was slow as traders
worked by candlelight, flashlight and light filtering through
skylights.
   Traffic was light on bridges into San Francisco and in most city
neighborhoods.
   A San Francisco city councilman, Bill Maher, said electric power
had been restored to about two-thirds of the city by morning and
should be fully restored by the end of the day.
   ``The city is in reasonably good shape,'' Agnos said. ``We've
survived this so far.''
   The mayor estimated 40 buildings in the city were unusable or
severely damaged.
   Pacific Bell said its telephone network suffered no significant
damage, but the system was being overloaded by a huge increase in
calls into and out of the region.
   In a grimly futile operation near Oakland's bayfront, crews
worked to clear concrete debris and searched for victims along a
mile-long portion of Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway, whose
upper level collapsed on a lower roadway crowded with rush hour
traffic.
   Dave Wilson of the state Office of Emergency Services said at
least 253 people died in the highway disaster. Authorities declined
to say how many bodies had been recovered, but said they based
their estimate on the number of cars believed crushed in the
debris. They said seven victims had been identified.
   Some people were pulled alive from the wreckage after the quake,
but Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said today searchers believed no
more survivors remained.
   Tractors, bulldozers and dump trucks were called out this
morning, and trucks and vans took bodies from the site.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' witness Leroy FitzGerald
said of the collapse. ``You could hear people screaming for help.''
   A 30-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge's top
level also collapsed, dropping onto a lower roadway and leaving
three cars dangling.
   State emergency services spokesman Tom Mullins said at
midafternoon that at least 272 people had died overall and 1,400
were injured.
   The San Francisco coroner's office said today it had confirmed
10 earthquake-related deaths. Authorities reported five deaths in
Santa Clara County and one in San Mateo County, areas just to the
south of San Francisco.
   Officials in Santa Cruz County said five people were killed
around the coastal city of Santa Cruz.
   In Washington, President Bush signed a disaster-relief
declaration and said ``we will take every step and make every
effort'' to help. Vice President Dan Quayle and Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner flew over the area for about an hour today
to survey the damage.
   The president said he would make a personal inspection in a few
days. White House officials said Bush probably would go on Friday
or Saturday.
   The quake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday along a segment of the huge
San Andreas Fault eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles
south of San Francisco. Dozens of aftershocks followed, including
one that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale shortly after the main
shock.
   The quake was felt in Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the northeast,
and high-rises shook in Los Angeles, 350 miles south of San
Francisco.
   Forty buildings reportedly collapsed in Santa Cruz and
Watsonville; Santa Cruz County emergency services coordinator Dina
Phillips estimated $350 million in damage. Lori Aldrete of the
California Association of Hospitals in Sacramento said the
Watsonville Community Hospital was evacuated, but no other details
were available.
   In Los Gatos, about 10 miles southwest of San Jose, Police Chief
Larry Todd said many buildings had collapsed, and there were some
reports of looting.
   At least two bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed, highways
leading out of the city were damaged, and mountain passes outside
Santa Cruz were closed due to landslides and fissures in the road,
the Highway Patrol said.
   The quake sent thousands of terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of Oakland and San Francisco.
   ``I've never been through anything like this in my life,'' said
Mary Garcia, who works in Oakland's Clorox building. ``I was on the
17th floor and the building just rocked and rocked. I was scared
out of my mind coming down the 17 floors.''
   Looting and vandalism were reported in San Francisco's major
crack dealing area, along Third Street. ``When the power is off,
opportunists come out,'' said police Dispatcher Chris Curran.
   Agnos asked the Army to help. National Guardsmen were being
mobilized, including engineers, military police and medical workers.
   Sixty-thousand baseball fans were evacuated from Candlestick
Park before the start of Game Three of the World Series. No major
injuries were reported at the stadium, which sustained structural
damage. Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said no decision had been
made on when or where to resume the Series.
   There were no reports of damage to the state's six nuclear
reactors, said Greg Cook, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman.
   The 6.9 Richter reading made this the sixth-most powerful quake
to strike California this century, and the most powerful since a
7.0 quake centered in Eureka in 1980.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage. A 7 is a
``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage. The 1906
earthquake, which occurred before the scale was devised, has been
estimated at 8.3.

<TEXT>
   Soviet psychiatrists living in exile
condemned the decision by the World World Psychiatric Association
on Wednesday to restore membership to the Soviet Union.
   Members voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the Soviet All-Union
Society of Psychiatrists after a six-year absence, but reserved the
right to suspend the membership if an investigation showed the
Soviets still used psychiatry for political purposes.
   The Soviets left the world organization in 1983 to avoid
expulsion because of allegations that dissidents were being
certified insane.
   Delegates of the official Soviet association admitted in Athens
that political abuse of psychiatry had occurred.
   An unofficial Soviet group, the Independent Psychiatric
Association, was admitted without conditions Wednesday. It was
established seven months ago by psychiatrists who oppose the
political use of their profession and is not recognized by the
Kremlin.
   No members of the independent organization attended the Athens
meeting. Sources said they were unable to get visas.
   Anatoly Koryagin, a psychiatrist who was held in a psychiatric
hospital for expressing dissident views and now lives in the West,
told a news conference after the meeting it would be difficult for
a review committee to investigate Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
   ``The Soviet psychiatrists will do their utmost to keep any
evidence of impropriety secret,'' he said.
   He said it would be ``almost impossible'' to get the two-thirds
majority needed to suspend Soviet membership. The resolution
adopted provides for an investigation during the next year, with
action to follow if necessary.
   Algirdas Stratkevicius, another emigre psychiatrist, said the
Soviets should have been given three years of probation before full
membership was restored, and said the World Psychiatric
Association's standards has been ``seriously lowered.''
   He and Koryagin held the news conference on behalf of the
Association Against the Political Use of Psychiatry, which is based
in Amsterdam and opposed restoration of the Soviet membership.
   Members passed the motion 291-45, with 19 abstentions. The
United States supported it.
   ``We wanted a compromise solution,'' said Melvin Sabshin,
medical director of the American Psychiatric Association. The
Americans had said they would oppose unconditional reinstatement
   A U.S. delegation visited the Soviet Union in February and found
that, despite improvements in the psychiatric system, patients
still did not enjoy the necessary legal safeguards.

   Former President Ronald Reagan urged
Americans in a television plea for Red Cross donations to help
victims of both the devastating San Francisco area earthquake and
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Now, more than ever, the American Red Cross needs your
support,'' Reagan said in a public service TV announcement taped
Wednesday at 20th Century Fox studios.
   Victims of the San Francisco Bay quake and Hurricane Hugo that
came ashore in South Carolina last month _ have turned to the Red
Cross for food, shelter and help in rebuilding their lives, Reagan
said.
   Red Cross resources have been depleted, and Reagan urged people
to call the Red Cross at 1-800-453-9000 with contributions.
   Reagan also presented a check to Red Cross officials, his
spokesman Mark Weinberg confirmed. The amount wasn't disclosed.
   Donations to help victims of the San Francisco area earthquake
are being accepted by several organizations, including:
   _ The National Catholic Disaster Relief Committee, 1319 F Street
NW, Washington, D.C., 20004.
   _ Checks can be sent to the American Red Cross disaster Relief
Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C., 20013, or to local Red
Cross chapters.
   _ The Salvation Army is accepting donations through local units
or through the Salvation Army National Headquarters, 799 Bloomfield
Ave., Verona, N.J., 07044. Checks designated for earthquake relief
will be used entirely for that purpose, the agency says.

   The government can bar railroad workers who
violate rail safety rules from safety-sensitive positions under new
federal rules issued Wednesday.
   The Federal Railroad Administration has previously had no
authority to remove private railroad employees. It gained the
authority to assess civil penalties in July 1988.
   The new rule, to take effect in 30 days, follows the Rail Safety
Improvement Act of 1988.
   Employees who face suspension or permanent disqualification by
the agency will be notified and may face a hearing, the agency
said. Any disqualification order would be disseminated throughout
the rail industry.
   FRA Administrator Gil Carmichael said the new regulation should
lead to ``a new level of respect for the rail safety rules and
regulations.''
   ``Our only goal is to improve safety,'' he said, ``and if
enforcement action against individuals is the best way to deal with
a serious safety situation, we will act fairly, but firmly.''
   The orders apply to supervisors as well as employees who operate
trains, issue orders to trains, conduct training or inspect or
repair locomotives, cars, tracks or signals.

   The White House on Wednesday belatedly
revealed that President Bush has accepted the resignation of
William Barclay Allen as chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights.
   Allen, a California professor, had sparked repeated
controversies during his tenure atop the embattled commission.
   The most recent came less than two weeks ago when he gave a
speech he titled, ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a
Minority?'' to the California Coalition for Traditional Values.
   The six other commission members voted to disassociate
themselves from the speech, saying the title was ``thoughtless,
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
   Allen, a professor of government at Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif., had offered his resignation some time ago, but
Bush did not formally accept it until Monday.
   Chase Untermeyer, the White House personnel director who
confirmed the action, said Murray Friedman, the vice chairman, will
be acting chairman.
   Allen remains on the commission, which is just six weeks away
from expiring unless Bush and Congress provide more money to keep
it going.
   Two commissioners' terms expire at the end of November or in
early December, and Untermeyer said Bush's ``aim is to name a new
chairman when a vacancy occurs.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Bush had
delayed accepting Allen's resignation because, with a vacancy in
the offing, ``it was to our advantage to simply have him remain as
chairman for as long as possible.''
   Allen also stirred controversy earlier this year by personally
intervening in a child custody suit on an Apache Indian
reservation. He was briefly arrested for kidnapping.

   Residents of the ridge-bound valleys of southern West Virginia
and eastern Kentucky cleaned out mud and debris Wednesday left by
flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry. And many of them
waited for more bad news.
   Forecasters predicted heavy showers that threatened to boost
water levels again. The National Weather Service issued a flood
watch through Thursday for 12 West Virginia counties and sections
of Virginia, with a flash flood watch for eastern Kentucky.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton toured flood-ravaged sections
of his state, primarily in Logan and Mingo counties.
   The worst damage appeared to be in Matewan, where 150 homes were
evacuated. The Tug Fork River overflowed its banks by 6 feet
Tuesday night in low-lying areas of Matewan. Downstream at
Williamson, the river crested about 3 feet above flood stage.
   ``This is the 32nd time this has happened in my lifetime,''
Albert Collins Sr. said from a porch behind a downtown Matewan
store. ``It used to be that it just gave us something to do to come
down here and watch it.''
   Now, however, he believes something should be done about it.
   Donald Daugherty, a mail carrier from McCarr, Ky., across the
river from Matewan, agreed as he surveyed the damage.
   ``It's hard enough if you have to go through this once in a
lifetime, but this is over and over and over again.''
   John Perdue, an executive assistant to Caperton, said
preliminary survey work for a Matewan flood wall is being done. No
construction timetable has been set, he said. Williamson already
has a new flood wall.
   In Kentucky, damage assessment teams from the state Division of
Disaster and Emergency Services toured four counties believed to be
hardest hit in Tuesday's flood, which many officials said was the
worst to strike the region since 1984.
   Flooding was still occurring at Jackson, Booneville and
Heidelberg as the Kentucky River continued to rise, the National
Weather Service reported.
   Eighty percent of the roads and bridges in Letcher County were
damaged by the flood, said county Judge-Executive Reuben Watts, who
estimated the repair cost at $1.5 million.
   ``We've still got quite a few places where people can't get to
their homes and can't get out,'' said Mike Watts, the judge's son.
He estimated 75 homes suffered flood damage and between 75 to 100
bridges were washed out. Many of the structures were small, private
bridges.
   Water damaged the homes of 200 people in Clay County and
drinking water was being brought to residents in the Big Creek
area, said Joe Jones, assistant emergency services coordinator for
the county.
   Pike County, across the Tug Fork from Williamson, W.Va.,
declared an emergency after high water stranded hundreds of
residents and closed schools for two days. One of the hardest-hit
areas was Beefhide Hollow, where at least 25 families were forced
from their homes.

   Israeli soldiers raided the main U.N. food

   An officer with Israel's military government of the occupied
territories, who would not let his name be used, said the soldiers
were investigating reports that ``some employees of UNRWA are
either participating in the uprising themselves or aiding
activities of the uprising.''
   The army spokesman's office declined comment.
   An uprising among the 1.7 million Palestinian residents began 22
months ago in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 596 Palestinians and
40 Israelis have died. At least 130 Palestinians have been killed
by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating Israel.
   Claire Grimes, spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
said documents were seized at the distribution center in the Gaza
Strip's Deir el-Balah refugee camp and three UNRWA staff members
were taken into custody.
   She said Christian Saunders of Britain and Declan Greenway of
Ireland were released after about an hour but the third, an Arab,
remained in Israeli hands.
   Ms. Grimes said the soldiers smashed the windows of a U.N. car
to get to the Arab staff member, who was locked inside. Palestinian
reporters identified him as Abdel Rahman Aiessa.
   In the West Bank, soldiers and paramilitary border police
briefly detained at least four staff members for questioning at
UNRWA offices in the Dheishe, Fawwar and Jalazoun refugee camps in
the West Bank, Ms. Grimes said.
   UNRWA sponsors aid programs for more than 375,000 Palestinian
refugees in the West Bank and 450,000 in Gaza.
   Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov, the army's chief prosecutor, told
the Israeli news agency Itim on Wednesday that 40,000 Palestinians
had been detained since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.
   He said 9,000 were held under ``administrative detention''
rules, allowing imprisonment for up to a year without charge or
trial, and about 600 had been detained more than once under those
provisions.
   Strashnov said 9,600 Palestinians currently were in custody,
including nearly 1,900 administrative detainees. Of the others, he
said, 2,799 had been convicted and sentenced, and the rest were in
the legal process.
   The prosecutor said 86 soldiers had been tried in military
courts for misconduct related to the uprising and 500-600 more had
been investigated. He did not give figures for convictions or
reprimands.
   A military court sentenced Ossman Marahia, 23, a Palestinian
from east Jerusalem, to 27 years in jail after he pleaded guilty
Wednesday to committing dozens of firebombings and arsons over five
years. The court was told a bus driver was slightly injured in one
incident.

   A drifter accused of raping and strangling a
pregnant physician in her office told police after his arrest that
hospital security was so lax he could sleep in doctors' beds, a
police official testified Wednesday.
   Steven Smith ``said he watched operations, slept in the doctors'
quarters and visited patients' rooms,'' testified Aaron Rosenthal,
assistant chief of police in charge of support services.
   Rosenthal, testifying at Smith's murder trial in state Supreme
Court, said Smith told him he lived in a storeroom on the
hospital's 22nd floor and walked around unnoticed in surgical garb
and carrying a stethoscope.
   Smith said he believed the victim, Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, let him
into her office because she assumed from his dress that he was a
doctor or other hospital employee, Rosenthal testified.
   Hinnant, 33, was killed Jan. 7. Five months pregnant, she was
found nearly naked, badly beaten and smeared with blood.
   Smith, 23, who has been in and out of mental hospitals for
years, has admitted he killed the woman but contends he was insane
and not responsible for the act.
   Rosenthal, then chief of detectives, arrested Smith in the
cafeteria of a men's shelter, where Smith sometimes lived.

<HEAD>Experts Give `Cold Fusion' Second Look And Call For More Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``cold fusion'' laboratory reaction is a
mystery that unmistakably produces heat and merits more research,
though it is unlikely ever to be a useful energy source, scientists
said Wednesday.
   John Appleby of Texas A&amp;M and Paul C. W. Chu of the University
of Houston, co-chairmen of closed conference on cold fusion, said
some new, unpublished experiments discussed in private by about 50
scientists showed that the cold fusion apparatus developed at the
University of Utah can show an unexplained production of heat.
   But it still is unclear if the reaction is chemical, nuclear or
some previously unrecognized phenomenon.
   ``We are happy our results are showing that something strange is
going on,'' said Appleby.
   He added that ``there is no evidence'' that the process would
ever be useful in energy devices, ``based on present very limited
knowledge.''
   The conference sponsors, the National Science Foundation and the
Electric Power Research Institute, originally did not plan to
announce any conclusions. But in response to requests from
reporters, Chu, Appleby and three other scientists held a news
conference.
   Appleby and Chu both both declined to give details of new cold
fusion experiments conducted by researchers attending the meeting
because the results have not been published.
   But in a prepared statement, Chu said that ``new, positive
results in excess heat production and nuclear product generation
have been presented and reviewed.
   ``Based on the information that we have, these effects cannot be
explained as a result of artifacts, equipment error or human
error,'' said Chu. However, he said, there are problems in the
predictable reproduction of the effects and in relating these
effects to known reactions.
   Among those attending the conference were Stanley Pons and
Martin Fleischmann, the two scientists who first claimed to have
achieved ``cold fusion'' in test tube experiments at the University
of Utah, where Pons is a chemistry professor. Fleischmann is on the
faculty of the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.
   Pons and Fleischmann stunned fusion researchers last March when
they announced at a news conference that they had achieved cold
fusion with a device composed of a electrodes of platinum and
palladium immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water.
They claimed that electricity applied to the water forced deuterium
atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium.
   The deuterium atoms in the metal, they said, eventually became
so dense that some fused, giving off heat equal to four times the
energy put in.
   Deuterium is a form of hydrogen. The fusion reaction, in which
hydrogen atoms merge to form helium and liberate energy, is what
powers all stars and thermonuclear weapons.
   Normally an extremely energetic trigger _ an atomic bomb for a
thermonuclear weapon, collapsing clouds of interstellar gas for
stars _ is needed to ignite fusion. Billions of dollars have been
spent in the last 40 years trying to find a way to harness fusion
reactions as practical energy sources that would liberate more
energy than they consume.
   Up to now most scientists have dismissed the Utah findings as
somehow erroneous.
   Appleby said new data from Pons and Fleischmann, and from other
researchers, has ``rehabilitated'' the reputation of the Utah
research. Few scientists, however, believe the reaction is actually
fusion.
   ``It is an anomalous phenomeon which cannot be black magic, but
cannot be explained by the normal rules of chemistry,'' said Chu.
   Edward Teller, a prominent nuclear physicist who helped develop
the first atomic bomb and pushed development of the first
thermonuclear weapons, attended the cold fusion workshop. In a
statement read at the news conference Teller said many cold fusion
results ``are in disagreement with the solidly established nuclear
theory of fusion'' and urged more research.

   Among the lessons demonstrated by the
catastrophic Bay Area earthquake is that the most lethal damage
isn't always closest to the epicenter, experts said Wednesday.
   The Oakland freeway that collapsed, killing an estimated 250
people, was 50 miles from the center of the quake. By contrast,
some places just a few miles from the epicenter were hardly scathed.
   Soft waterfront soils, construction practices, land-use patterns
and changes in seismic waves as they move away from an epicenter
can conspire to create hopscotch patterns of earthquake damage,
experts said.
   The collapse of Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway, was the most
deadly disaster caused by the jolt, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale. Directly across the bay, there was extensive damage
in some sections of San Francisco.
   Far fewer casualties were reported in extensively damaged Santa
Cruz, just 10 miles south of the epicenter. In San Jose, 18 miles
north of the epicenter, damage was relatively mild.
   ``That seems to mainly be a function of ground conditions:
either artificially filled ground or not very stable natural
deposits around the margins of the bay,'' said geologist Douglas
Hamilton, president of Earth Sciences Associates, a Palo Alto
consulting firm.
   The Nimitz Freeway apparently rests on soft fill and bay mud,
and ``that was probably a factor,'' said Bob Streitz, a supervising
geologist at the California Division of Mines and Geology in
Sacramento.
   Hamilton said San Jose may have escaped catastrophic damage
because much of the city sits on stream deposits somewhat firmer
than bayfront mud and fill.
   In general, the intensity of ground shaking is strongest near
the epicenter, which explains why many buildings and roads
collapsed in Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Los Gatos and Hollister.
   Ronald Scott, a civil engineering professor at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said bedrock tends to shake at
high frequencies _ short, sharp jolts _ while soft fill and mud
produce ``more of a rolling effect that goes on longer. The motion
may be magnified on top of such deposits.''
   That was illustrated by catastrophic earthquakes centered on
Mexico's Pacific coast in 1985. The worst damage was in Mexico
City, which rests on soft sediments of an old lakebed 250 miles
from the epicenter.
   The change in seismic waves as they spread from a fault, along
with softer soils, give the waves longer vibration periods, Scott
said. That can make them more damaging to large structures, such as
I-880 or the Bay Bridge, than to small ones.
   ``The farther you go, there is some tendency for larger
structures to be affected,'' he said.
   Another reason for the concentration of deaths far from the
epicenter of Tuesday's quake is simply that the San
Francisco-Oakland area is more heavily populated.
   ``Santa Cruz experienced the kind of damage it did because it
was in the earthquake epicentral area,'' Scott said. ``But there
isn't a big Nimitz Freeway running through Santa Cruz. The biggest
concentration of large structures is around San Francisco.''

<HEAD>Youngest Politburo Member Takes Over From Mentor Honecker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egon Krenz, East Germany's new Communist Party
leader, grew to political maturity under the tutelage of his
hard-line predecessor, Erich Honecker.
   Convivial and articulate, Krenz's outgoing nature offers a
personal contrast to the aging, ailing Honecker. But politically he
adhers to the same orthodox brand of party doctrine as his ousted,
77-year-old mentor.
   The state news agency ADN announced Wednesday that the
52-year-old Krenz succeeded Honecker as head of the party, the
government and the military. Honecker came under increasing fire at
home as opposition mounted and a refugee exodus continued.
   Career politician Krenz is by far the youngest official on the
21-member Politburo dominated by aging Communists, many of them in
their 70s. But he has a reputation for following Honecker's hard
line.
   A burly, bushy-haired man, Krenz long has been plagued by rumors
he was an alcoholic, although there has been virtually nothing to
substantiate that.
   He is known for his spontaneous visits to local bars and
restaurants that give his bodyguards the jitters. Communist Party
sources say he enjoys striking up conversations with patrons.
   Krenz was born the son of a tailor in Kolberg, a coastal town in
what is now northwestern Poland, on March 19, 1937.
   He joined East Germany's communist youth organization in 1953,
while he was still in high school and the East German nation was
four years old.
   Krenz studied to become a teacher, but joined the East German
army and rose to the rank of lieutenant before being discharged in
1959.
   After studying in Moscow from 1964 to 1967, Krenz returned to
party work, beginning with the youth organization.
   He has been a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee
since 1973 and joined the ruling Politburo 10 years later.
   In recent years, he has been in charge of official youth
organizations and internal security matters, while many
acknowledged he was being groomed to take over from Honecker.
   Krenz lives in a heavily guarded compound reserved for
high-ranking Communist Party officials at Lake Wandlitz, about nine
miles north of Berlin.
   He has long mirrored Honecker's line on various issues _
repeating, for example, the long-held assertion that the
``imperialist'' West poses a threat to communist East Germany.
   In a profile on Oct. 8, West Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper
said Krenz is married and has two children.

<HEAD>Northwest Jet Makes Emergency Landing At Monte Vista</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines jet with 104
people aboard made an emergency landing at a small, unattended
airport Wednesday after losing electrical power, sliding off a
short runway and into the mud, officials said.
   The DC-9 filled with smoke after landing, and the captain had to
use an ax stored above an emergency exit to release cabin pressure
and allow the doors open, a passenger said.
   One of the 99 passengers was treated for shock and minor
injuries at a hospital in Alamosa nearly 20 miles from this
southern Colorado city and released, hospital officials said. The
pilot suffered minor cuts and bruises.
   The plane, which had been flying from Minneapolis to Phoenix,
went dark about 11 p.m., said passenger Judy Sciola, 49, of Edina,
Minn.
   ``We started shaking a little bit,'' she said. ``We circled and
circled. Then we hit the runway. There was a lot of scraping and
flames. I'm sure the tires exploded.''
   ``I could hear the landing gear go down,'' Sciola said. ``The
pressure was just awful. The little baby next to me was just
screaming.''
   The plane slid about 1,000 feet off the end of the runway at
Monte Vista Municipal Airport at 12:20 a.m., said Bob Johnson,
regional director of the National Transportation Safety Board in
Denver.
   ``The crew seemed as confused as the passengers were. They
couldn't get a door open,'' Sciola said. ``Then it got even more
frightening because we thought we were going to blow up.''
   The only apparent damage to the jet was flat tires, Johnson said.
   ``Compliment that captain,'' said passenger Todd Curtis of
Thatcher, Ariz. Passengers said they could smell the tires burning
during the landing, but said there was no panic on the jet even
though the captain was unable to talk them over the intercom.
   When the plane landed, the crew had difficulty opening the doors
because the cabin pressure was wrong, Tina Borgmann, 24, of Waseca,
Minn., told WCCO radio in Minneapolis.
   The plane filled up with smoke, and ``the captain came running
back to try to get the doors open.'' she said. ``The captain had to
take an ax to the door. He finally got the doors to open. The
slides came out and all (aboard the aircraft) went down the
slides.''
   The airport was unattended, and the pilot apparently called the
Rio Grande County sheriff's office from a pay phone there, Johnson
said.
   Northwest did not release the captain's name, saying its policy
was that it not release names of pilots involved in accidents
unless a death was involved.
   The jet's left generator apparently failed in flight and the
pilot tried unsuccessfully to start an auxiliary power unit, the
NTSB official said. The right generator failed soon after, and the
plane was left with battery backup power, which would have lasted
about 25 minutes.
   Airline officials said the cause of the malfunction was not
immediately known. Investigators from the NTSB, the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Northwest went to Monte Vista.
   The passengers and crew spent the night in Alamosa, and were to
take another plane to Phoenix, Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen
said in Minneapolis.
   The Monte Vista airport has a runway 6,000 feet long and 60 feet
wide, Johnson said.
   ``Under ideal conditions that would be acceptable, but in an
emergency situation, it's marginal,'' he said.

   Condolences and offers of help poured in from around the world
Wednesday after a major earthquake hit Northern California. The
pope offered prayers, a moment of silence was observed in Portugal
and thousands of people jammed international phone lines trying to
reach their loved ones.
   Baseball fans in Japan watching the World Series via a special
satellite service of the Japan Broadcasting Corp. watched in shock
as correspondent Naoki Morinaka experienced the 6.9 quake from the
stadium press box.
   ``Earthquake. Oh, oh,'' Morinaka said. ``It's shaking quite a
lot ... almost all the lights are out.''
   Stock prices tumbled in Manila, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur on
news of the quake, which killed more than 250 people. Traders said
investors feared an adverse effect on insurance and bank stocks in
New York.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose country was
devastated by a 6.9 quake last year, expressed ``sincere sympathy''
in a telegram to President Bush.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters
the Armenian earthquake made the Soviets especially sensitive to
the plight of California residents. Much of Armenia still is in
ruins, despite millions of dollars in assistance from the United
States and elsewhere.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel offered California the
services of a special army rescue squad that also helped dig out
victims of the Armenian earthquake. The team is considered one of
the best in the world.
   A French disaster relief agency, International Emergency Action,
said it was ready to send special teams of searchers, along with
dogs and electronic listening gear to search for victims trapped
under collapsed highways or buildings.
   A team of British engineers will fly to San Francisco on
Thursday to help assess structural damage from the quake.
   ``They will be ... learning lessons to apply for the next time,
because there will be a next time in San Francisco,'' said
Alistaire Soane, chairman of the Bingham Cotterell engineering
company.
   Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said her country
was ready to give any other help that might be needed.
   ``I am very distressed indeed to hear of what is clearly a major
disaster and hasten to send my deepest sympathy to you and all
those who have suffered. Please let me know if there is anything at
all which we can do to help,'' she said in a telegram to Bush.
   The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and relatives in
Japan, the Philippines and other Asian countries began a desperate
attempt to reach their relatives after hearing of the quake.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he was ``deeply
saddened'' by the devastation, especially because the Japanese
people themselves ``are so vulnerable to this natural disaster,'' a
reference to the many quakes Japan has suffered.
   The Osaka city government announced it was sending $10,000 in
aid to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.
   Radio stations in the Philippines interrupted regular
programming for frequent reports on the earthquake. So many
Filipinos tried to phone California that they swamped roughly 100
telephone operators of the Philippine Long Distance Co.
   Italian state radio also interrupted its programs overnight to
break the news of the earthquake. Many Italian-Americans live in
the San Francisco area.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry set up a ``crisis center'' at its
headquarters in Rome to take calls from worried relatives.
   Pope John Paul II is ``deeply saddened'' by the deaths and
destruction and is praying for the victims, the Vatican said. ``His
Holiness joins the population in their suffering and offering
special prayers to God for San Francisco and surrounding areas.''
   Local government representatives from the 23 Council of Europe
member countries took time out of their conference in Lisbon,
Portugal, to stand for a minute of silence in memory of quake
victims.
   Messages were sent from the United Nations and the governments
of Egypt, India, Ireland, Turkey, West Germany, the Netherlands,
Jordan, and Canada.
   President Carlos Menem of Argentina said in a telegram to Bush:
``The United States has given proof of its courage to confront very
dramatic moments in its history and I'm sure that today, too,
American's spirit to fight will overcome these events.''
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who learned of the quake
during a conference in Malaysia, sent a message saying: ``It is
cruelly disheartening that the magnitude of death and destruction
continues to grow, many hours after the earthquake and aftershocks
wreaked such havoc.''

   Unseasonably cool temperatures produced light snow in Chicago
and parts of Vermont, Maine and Michigan, and remnants of Hurricane
Jerry kept some rivers rising in Kentucky and rain falling in
numerous states Wednesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from northern Florida across
Georgia and the Carolinas, and from Virginia to New York state and
into New England.
   Rain also fell in portions of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton toured his state's
flood-ravaged southern region, promising to make available
low-interest aid to residents hit by two days of high water.
   ``The remains of Hurricane Jerry dumped several inches of rain
... Monday night and Tuesday,'' said Peter Parke, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in Charleston, W.Va.
   ``The ground is still sopping wet from these rains.
Additionally, the Appalachian woods are settling into their winter
dormancy and cannot absorb much rainfall anymore,'' he said.
   Flooding damaged homes in southern West Virginia and Kentucky,
where the Kentucky River continued to rise.
   Houlton, Maine, had an inch of snow at daybreak. Besides Maine,
snow slickened roads in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont,
Illinois and New York state.
   Overnight temperatures were unseasonably cool over much of the
Plains and the Mississippi Valley.
   The morning low dipped to 9 degrees in Bismark, N.D., breaking
the city's record of 10 degrees for the date set in 1972.
   Key West, Fla., reached 89 degrees in the early afternoon,
passing its record high of 88 for Oct. 18 set in 1952.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Houlton and Presque Island, Maine, and Marquette, Mich.,
to 96 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Two Hill Air Force Base security policemen
pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges in the theft of three
F-16 jet engines they sold to undercover federal agents.
   Airman 1st Class Brian David Roth of Chesterland, Ohio, pleaded
guilty to five of 22 counts in an indictment charging theft of the
engines and other military equipment from the northern Utah base.
Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud of Newton, Kan., pleaded guilty to
one count of stealing the engines.
   The pleas were entered as part of an agreement in which another
count charging Stroud with the theft of $64,000 worth of computers
and the remaining 17 charges against Roth will be dropped when U.S.
District Judge David Sam sentences the men Dec. 12.
   Prosecutors said the airmen agreed to sell the Pratt &amp; Whitney
F100-PW-200 engines to FBI agents posing as operators of a mock
military surplus store as part of Operation Punchout, a three-year
undercover operation that netted an assortment of government
munitions and equipment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Lubeck said Roth, 22, began
selling stolen equipment in October 1987, and that in July 1988
sold $40,000 worth of aviation instruments from a disabled F-4 jet
fighter.
   In December of that year, Roth sold the undercover agents a
portable radio valued at about $6,000 and six jackets and two
bayonets worth $500, Lubeck said.
   He said Roth sold the agents 11 night vision devices valued at
$40,000 last March, and began discussing the theft of the F-16
engines at that time.
   Lubeck said Stroud, 24, drove the trailer and engines off the
base during the July Fourth holiday weekend while Roth monitored
base radio traffic to ensure the operation would go undetected.
   The engines, which with a trailer and tow tractor were valued at
$8 million, were turned over to the agents and stored in a
warehouse by the FBI. The purchase price was to be $300,000,
authorities have said.
   Stroud and Roth were arrested July 10.
   The penalty for each of the theft counts is up to 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Federal grand juries have returned about 20 indictments since

<HEAD>Anchors Fly to Quake Site, NBC Explains Slow Start of Quake Coverage</HEAD>

   Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw flew
west to anchor their Wednesday newscasts from quake-battered San
Francisco, while NBC officials explained NBC's slow initial
reportage of the quake.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner said the delay _ NBC was the
last to air pictures from the scene _ was because Tuesday's killer
earthquake had temporarily knocked NBC's San Francisco affiliate,
KRON-TV, off the air.
   That in turn delayed NBC's ability to immediately broadcast from
San Francisco, he said. In contrast, he added, the affiliated
stations of CBS and ABC still could function, thus competitively
helping their networks.
   Once it got rolling after 9 p.m. Tuesday, NBC offered non-stop
quake coverage _ including that on a five-hour ``Today'' show _
until noon Wednesday.
   Although CBS' coverage continued past midnight and ``Nightline''
aired a special update at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, ``we were the only
guy on all night long,'' Gartner said, referring only to the major
broadcast networks.
   Cable News Network, a 24-hour operation, also stayed on the
earthquake story throughout the night, relying in part on reports
from one of the Bay-area stations with which it has an affiliate
agreement, KTVU-TV in Oakland.
   Gartner described as ``bad luck'' NBC's initial delay in
reporting the earthquake.
   ``In a crisis, your first line of defense is that you go to your
affiliate'' where the crisis has happened, he said. ``And they
(KRON) were knocked out of the box.''
   ABC, in San Francisco to broadcast Game Three of the World
Series, actually was on the air with a pre-game sports report from
Candlestick Park when the quake hit at 8:04 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
   Four minutes later, Cable News Network aired the first bulletin
about the quake. CBS' bulletin by anchorman Dan Rather was at 8:21
p.m., followed two minutes later by a 60-second news report by Ted
Koppel, anchor of ABC's ``Nightline.''
   In contrast, NBC's first quake bulletin, read from Washington by
correspondent Katherine Couric, didn't air until 8:31 p.m. It
wasn't until after 9 p.m. that NBC joined its rivals in airing
pictures from the scene.
   It wasn't the happiest night for NBC anchor Tom Brokaw. Early in
his reports, when quake casualty figures were rising, he said 40
people had been reported killed in one freeway collapse and more
than 50 in another.
   The latter report proved erroneous. Brokaw subsquently corrected
himself on the air, an NBC spokeswoman said.
   In an action reminiscent of September 1985, when Brokaw, Rather
and ``World News Tonight'' anchor Peter Jennings of ABC anchored
their broadcasts from quake-stricken Mexico City, all three flew to
San Francisco to anchor their programs there.
   Each of the three men also anchored a one-hour prime-time
special on the San Francisco earthquake Wednesday.
   Rather also will anchor a ``48 Hours'' earthquake special
Thursday night. ABC's Sam Donaldson will also be in San Francisco
that night, co-anchoring his half of the ``PrimeTime Live'' news
series, ABC said.
   NBC's ``Today,'' starting a three-day visit in Chicago when the
quake hit, will broadcast from San Francisco on Thursday and Friday.
   With the second quake-caused postponement of Game Three of the
World Series announced Wednesday, ABC's schedule for that night
shifted from baseball to four sitcoms normally shown on Wednesday.
Jenning's earthquake special bumped a series on ABC, ``China
Beach.''
   ABC had no comment on how much it might lose in advertising
revenue because of postponements of the World Series.
   One Madison Avenue executive, Richard Kostrya, estimated that it
could total $10 million a night for each night the Series is
postponed. He said his figures represent the amount he estimates
regular programming earns.
   A postponed Series game, when finally broadcast, displaces a
night of regular programming and thus its advertising revenue,
explained Kostrya, an executive vice president at the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency.
   ABC, which he said got from $250,000 to $325,000 for each
30-second commercial to be shown during World Series telecasts,
won't lose that money, he said. The commercials will simply appear
when the next game does.
   ABC, he said, ``didn't lose the World Series money. That'll move
with the game.''

<HEAD>Opposition Says Political Prisoners Tortured in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA VICTORIA GONZALEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the opposition Christian
Democrats said Wednesday the party vice president was tortured in
prison and other party members were mistreated while under arrest
by the government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Party President Ricardo Arias Calderon said Raul Ossa ``was
submitted to cruel physical and psychological torture'' after being
arrested Oct. 3. Ossa was held for six days in La Chorrera jail in
the western part of the city.
   Military rebels tried unsuccessfully on Oct. 3 to oust Noriega,
who as head of the Defense Forces also controls the government.
   Arias Calderon said Ossa ``could see five members of the party
manacled to a water pipe and was told he also would be so they
would be the first to fall when the gringo invaders took the
barracks.''
   ``On more than one occasion they put a gun to his temple,'' he
said. ``For 11 hours he was blindfolded with gauze, left standing
up, interrogated and beaten hard in the stomach.''
   Guards took turns to keep Ossa from sleeping, Arias Calderon
reported.
   The party said it was creating a special human rights commission
to be headed by Ossa that will denounce violations of its members'
rights, assist victims and relatives, and educate the public.
   Arias Calderon said the Oct. 3 rebels ``were interrogated about
a supposed link between the Christian Democratic Party and an
American invasion.''
   The U.S. government has been using economic and political
pressure trying to force Noriega out after he was indicted on U.S.
drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   Noriega denies the charges and says the campaign against him is
part of a U.S. effort to avoid giving up the Panama Canal at the
end of 1999 under the 1977 canal treaties.
   Arias Calderon said the Christian Democrats' publicity director
was arrested on Sept. 28, accused of attacking the state, but has
not been mistreated.
   Five other party members were jailed on Oct. 2 for carrying
posters bearing slogans including those demanding Arias Calderon's
freedom when he was briefly under arrest.
   Arias Calderon said an arrest warrant is out for party official
Ramon Aizpurua, now abroad, on charges of financing an armed
movement aimed at overthrowing the government.

<HEAD>Shows Open on Optimistic, Feminine Notes for Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lots of youthful, feminine clothes were shown in
early openings Wednesday as ready-to-wear shows for summer 1990 got
underway.
   Great fabrics, curvy silhouettes and soft color palettes were
about the only things designers had in common as everybody did his
or her own thing.
   Also on the opening day, Lanvin announced at a press conference
that Claude Montana _ known as one of the most creative
ready-to-wear talents in Paris _ would be the new creator of
Lanvin's couture. Montana is a maverick, whose strong fashions and
silhouettes have often rocked the fashion world.
   Montana's first couture collection will be shown in January, for
next summer.
   In her tent show in a courtyard of the Louvre, Lolita Lempicka
showed clothes with just enough chic to keep the sweet fashions
from cloying. Her bicolored fitted linen suits, either short to the
knee or maxi-length, often had fitted jackets with scalloped
necklines.
   One of her main silhouettes was formed by gold-buttoned long
redingotes giving a funnel shape to the linens or textured
``beehive'' ivory silks.
   Other flowingly feminine shapes came out under billowy-topped
dusters with long wrapped skirts.
   Lempicka's garden-party clothes had fresh allure with appliqued
daisies or fitted jackets in daisy prints. Dressy looks for wedding
parties are Lempicka's forte, but she also brought out some fun
fringed, clinging outfits in raffia _ a big new ``fabric'' for next
summer.
   Doby Broda's idea of the 1990s harks to the 1930s, with lots of
flowing pyjamas and long skirts. Some in the audience liked her
flower-sprigged ``farmer's daughter'' dresses in soft or murky
colors.
   More fun were her easy pants or skirts outfits based on
``dishcloth'' linens _ the little loose dishcloth-plaid boleros
paired with solid blue full pants, skirts or occasionally shorts.
   For evening, her gold lame bias-cut dresses and flared pants
looked slinky enough to steal applause at parties, though perhaps
not quite luxurious enough for Marlene Dietrich.
   Emmanuelle Khanh brought out a lot of long and slinky suits for
cruise wear, as well as some modest one-piece maillot bathing suits
with little flounces at the hip.
   Her sailor looks ranged from pants to shorts to skirts _ in
crisp navy and white or more original rusty brown cottons and
linens. For late-day, her best lines were easily fitted outfits
with strong black and white arabesque embroideries around collars
and shoulders.
   The Japanese are out in force as usual. Hanae Mori will show
later in the week, but Tuesday night was awarded the Legion of
Honor for her contribution to Paris fashion in the couture and
ready-to-wear shows she has shown and sold here for over 20 years.
   Junko Shimada's bouncy young styles were always figure-hugging,
featuring bright turquoise beach mini-dresses with pointed hems,
printed in seashell patterns, topped with fishnet stoles.
   There was lots of creativity here _ from scalloped pique fitted
suits with very short skirts to a whole range of clinging broadly
striped sailor suits teaming pullovers with bell-bottomed jerseys
or tight bermudas like turn-of-the-century bathing costumes.
   The neat linen suits with decollete, small-waisted jackets in
shades of sand, turquoise, pale pink and chocolate had details like
big bucket pockets, tab pockets or perky pointed peplums.
   And Shimada's combinations of dark plaids and insets, sleeves
and double collars or tobacco-brown organza looked original, if not
for everyone.
   Party girls with good figures will probably love the khaki green
clinging jersey and gold lame outfits with their gold lattice-work
hemlines and mousseline stoles.
   Hiroko Koshino's collection was based on a cruise down the Nile,
from safari suits to outfits with asymmetrical details, folding and
pleating that could have come right from an Egyptian fresco or the
wardrobe of Cleopatra herself.
   In patterned silks and textured linens, the inspiration may have
been ancient, but the lines were modern _ with lots of high-waisted
pants, some bare midriffs, original jackets with one side covered
in a pleated scarf effect over wraparound skirts.
   There were lots of long jackets over pleated skirts or vests
sewn onto the skirt in a dress. And whether worn with shorts,
pleated or draped long skirts, the effect of these combinations was
never heavy.
   The colors _ sandy beige or grey, Nile green, deep fresco blue,
terra-cotta and mustard or gold _ gave the silk and linen outfits
an original cachet for next summer.
   Transparency was rife in the shows, but nowhere was it more
obvious than at Kimijima. He concentrated on mousselines and
fishnets topped with enough sparkly sequins to cause a few
shipwrecks with sailors spotting his revealing mermaid minis.

<HEAD>South Korean President Completes Washington Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae Woo completed
an official Washington visit Wednesday defending his government's
performance on democracy, human rights and opening of its markets
to imports.
   The president, his wife and members of his cabinet later flew to
Los Angeles for a meeting Wednesday night with former President
Reagan and a Thursday address.
   In Wednesday speeches to members of Congress and later to the
National Press Club, the Roh sought to assure his listeners that
democracy revived under his 1{-year-old administration is in South
Korea to stay _ ``an unstoppable force which no one can divert,''
he said.
   Roh said that since 1985 South Korea has lowered trade barriers
faster than most countries, and all trade issues with the United
States eventually will be ``resolved to mutual satisfaction.''
   Answering questions at the press club, Roh said it was unfair to
accuse Korea of backsliding on trade liberalization, and specific
issues would be solved ``one by one.''
   Roh also predicted South Korea and China eventually will have
normal relations. Contacts rapidly expanded from the time of the
1988 Seoul Olympics until slowed by China's crackdown last June on
pro-democracy demonstrators, he said, but ``I am sure they will
pick up again, and sure that we will have normal relations with
China.''
   Seeking the offensive against human rights critics who say his
government is reverting to repression, Roh said in his speech to
Congress, ``I will confront squarely every challenge to our young
democracy, whether from within or without.''
   He said ``regrettably, certain radicals have resorted to force
and committed unlawful acts to pursue their aims under the guise of
democratic reform ... here are also the tiny band of extremists who
parade anti-American slogans and perpetrate attacks on U.S.
facilities.''
   That was the closest he came to mentioning the invasion and
vandalism of the U.S. ambassador's residence in Seoul last week by
six young militants.

<TEXT>
   In the glare of TV lights, Parliament
changed the country's communist name and created a democratic
system Wednesday by adopting key constitutional amendments.
   Amendments formally ending one-party domination in Hungary,
regulating free elections by next summer and creating the office of
state president won overwhelming approval at the nationally
televised session of Parliament.
   The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary. Like other
Soviet bloc nations, it had been known as a ``people's republic''
since 1949.
   But the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy,
postponing a decision on opposition calls for a referendum on when
to elect the head of state. Government leaders want the election
next month, but opposition leaders say it's too soon.
   Nonetheless, speaker of Parliament Matyas Szueros, who takes
over as acting president until a new head of state is elected,
proclaimed Wednesday a historic day for Hungary.
   ``A parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built in
Hungary on the ruins of a dictatorship of sorts,'' Szueros
reportedly told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
   The voting followed dissolution of the communist party and its
replacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party, which vows commitment
to a democratic system while continuing for the moment to dominate
national politics.
   The State Department said Wednesday in a statement in
Washington: ``Today the Hungarian Parliament voted overwhelmingly
in favor of an amended constitution which leaves only about 10
percent of the 1949 Stalinist document in place. The amended
constitution contains democratic principles and many of the
elements of our own Bill of Rights. The constitution provides that
Hungary will be declared a `republic.' not a `people's republic.'
The word `people's' was a legacy from the Stalin era.''
   Parliament also began discussion of a law that will regulate the
operation and finances of political parties in the first multiparty
elections since 1947.
   Among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating all
references to the leading role of the dissolved communist party.
   ``Political partiess may be freely established and may freely
function,'' the amendment declared.
   An entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted by
the new Parliament after the national elections, but Justice
Minister Kalman Kulcsar has said the amendments were necessary to
make next year's elections legal.
   The new post of president of the republic replaces the 21-man
collective presidency that had broad powers, including acting for
Parliament when it was not sitting, as well as overruling
parliamentary decisions.
   Once the amendments take effect this month, the presidential
council will be dissolved and Szueros will assume its powers until
a president is elected.
   The new president will be the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, is authorized to call national and regional elections and
may initiate a referendum.
   The president may also dissolve Parliament if it fails to
approve a new government or votes for no-confidence in the
government four times in one year.
   The new president may be stripped of his office if he knowingly
violates the constitution or other laws and may not be a leader of
any political party.
   Before the key votes, Premier Miklos Nemeth called an emergency
Cabinet meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone the
election to the new state presidency, tentatively scheduled for
Nov. 26, until after next year's parliamentary elections.
   Some opposition parties assert they have no time or resources to
organize against Socialist Party candidate Imre Pozsgay.
   The premier and all but one of his ministers were ranking
members of the communist party, and most remain in the top levels
of the new socialist party. However, the ministries of the
interior, finance and trade and commerce now are formally
depoliticized.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men shot to death a
Protestant in front of his family in an outlying village late
Wednesday, and the IRA claimed responsibility.
   The victim, who was not immediately identified, was killed at
his home in Magheralin, a village 17 miles southwest of Belfast,
when he answered a knock at the door, city police headquarters said
in a statement.
   Police said the victim's wife and teen-age daughter witnessed
the killing.
   The gunmen used a stolen car, which was later found burned out
five miles from the scene of the attack, police said. However, they
gave few other details.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility in a message to Belfast news organizations.
   It said the victim was a key figure among Protestant
paramilitary groups. The statement said he had been involved in
attacks on Catholic targets.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Search Continues After Bodies Found in Shallow Graves</HEAD>

   Investigators used a backhoe Wednesday
at a farm where three bodies were found in shallow graves, but said
little about their search for others.
   Residents began calling in leads after the badly decomposed
bodies were found Monday night and removed Tuesday from a barn,
said Greg Coon, a spokesman for a law enforcement task force.
   ``We get good leads and bad leads,'' Coon said.
   Investigators used the backhoe to dig around a well between the
barn and a farmhouse. Two other sites in the area were searched
Wednesday, but investigators would not say where they were.
   The search began last week after the Oct. 9 arrests of an
elderly couple on charges of conspiracy to steal in an alleged
cattle swindle.
   Ray Copeland, 75, and Faye Copeland, 68, remained in jail
Wednesday on bonds of $25,000 each. No other charges have been
filed against them.
   The bodies, all male, were found in separate, shallow graves on
a farm 12 miles south of the Copelands' home in Mooresville, about
90 miles northeast of Kansas City.
   The bodies have not been identified.
   Neil Bryan, who owns the barn where the bodies were discovered,
said Copeland worked for him doing odd jobs over the last 20 years.
John Hovey, who said he rented the farm from Bryan, said Copeland
had warned him and his four children to stay out of the barn.
   ``It stunk in the barn. I thought an animal had crawled in there
and died,'' Hovey said.
   Bryan is not a suspect, authorities said.
   Livingston County Sheriff Leland O'Dell has been secretive about
what investigators are seeking. The Major Case Squad, a task force
formed Friday, said in its first statement that investigators were
trying to locate an unspecified number of transients who had stayed
with the Copelands.
   The Copeland farm has already been searched.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Israel Won't Compromise on PLO Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Wednesday
his government will never compromise on its opposition to talks
with the PLO or on its refusal to trade land for peace, two main
points of disagreement between Israel and the United States.
   ``This is our land from the dawn of history, and it will be so
always. We will not be pushed or pressured,'' he told a convention
of fundamentalist Christians.
   Still, Israeli leaders appeared to be trying to dampen a
smoldering conflict with the United States following Shamir's
remarks Tuesday that Israel would rather face conflict with
Washington than accept a U.S.-backed plan that could lead to talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens telephoned Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and they spoke for 45 minutes on Baker's efforts to
restart the Middle East peace process, Israel radio said. It gave
no details and Arens' spokesman declined comment.
   On Tuesday night, Shamir called President Bush about Shamir's
planned mid-November visit to Washington.
   ``They talked about the peace initiative and how they can
advance it,'' Shamir's office said. ``Both think it is very
important to meet in order to get a better understanding between
the United States and Israel about the peace initiative.''
   Israel radio said the issue of Shamir's statements Tuesday did
not come up.
   Before calling Bush, Shamir told members of his right-wing Likud
bloc, ``We must accept the assumption that we may be entering a
tense period with the United States.''
   ``This time the battle is hard. It's a miracle that, thus far,
we have held our own against the world, where no element supports
our position.''
   Later he told a Likud rally in Ramle that ``the stone-throwers,
the firebombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of
the PLO. It is not possible that when they fail to do this, others
by diplomatic means ... would try to bring us to meetings with the
PLO.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiller called Shamir's
statements ``unhelpful'' and said the United States ``is not
looking for a fight with Israel.''
   But Shamir made it clear in his speech to the Christian
convention Wednesday night that Israel will not budge in opposing
direct or indirect talks with the PLO or withdrawal from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He accused the PLO of striving toward ``the creation of a
Palestinian state in place of Israel. ... Let me make it very
clear. There will be no second Arab state in the land of Israel.''
   The biblical names of Judea and Samaria embrace what is now the
West Bank.
   The United States advocates trading land for peace. Baker
proposed consultations among Israel, Egypt and the United States
aimed at convening a meeting between Israel and Palestinians.
   Shamir's Likud bloc sees the Israeli-Palestinian meeting as
bringing the PLO into talks through the back door.

   A local police captain
who was a former senator was charged Wednesday with looting in the
aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, court records showed.
   Adelbert Bryan, 49, was released on $5,000 bond by Federal
Magistrate Jeffrey Resnick after being charged with grand larceny
and possession of stolen property, according to U.S. District Court
records.
   Also charged was prominent restaurant owner Michael Harris of
the Ritz Cafe.
   Widespread looting occurred in Christiansted after the hurricane
devastated St. Croix on Sept. 17. U.S. officials had to send about
1,100 troops from the mainland to help restore order on St. Croix,
one of the islands hardest hit in the Caribbean by Hugo.
   ``We have filed significant cases where people who knew better _
or who should have known better _ took items that had little or
nothing to do with survival,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney David
Nissman.
   The FBI said Bryan, who as one of the island's 15 senators
unsuccessfully ran against Gov. Alexander Farrelly in 1986, was
seen by several witnesses, including police officers, in a truck
loaded with plywood taken from a wrecked shopping center.

<TEXT>
   A group of educators has decided to
publish the American equivalent of a Soviet math and physics
magazine to counter what they say is the poor state of high school
education in the United States.
   The magazine, called Quantum, will be aimed at gifted high
school students, organizers at Harvard University said. It will
begin by publishing material translated from the original Soviet
magazine Kvant, but may eventually expand to include articles by
American scientists.
   Kvant's articles are written by leading Soviet scientists and
address current issues in math and physics and include sets of
problems for students to solve.
   Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel laureate and professor of physics at
Harvard, will serve as Quantum's physics editor.
   Glashow said he hopes the magazine will improve American science
education.
   He said test results have placed U.S. students at a level of
general science knowledge roughly equivalent to that of
underdeveloped countries.
   ``American math education is in terrible shape,'' added William
Thurston, a faculty member at Princeton University, who will be
Quantum's math editor.
   The first copies of Quantum will be distributed in November. The
magazine's organizers said they have received a grant from the
National Science Foundation and plan to support the publication
through advertising and subscriptions.
   There will be 100,000 copies printed for the first issue. Nine
issues will be published per year.

   ``A Bronx Tale,'' written and acted by Chazz
Palminteri, tells the story of a boy growing up with two father
figures, one of them a mobster.
   It's an interesting large anecdote, stuffed full of small,
fascinating, well-rounded anecdotes, containing both gritty
unpleasantness and light humor plus some moral points.
   The play, in which Palminteri takes a boy he calls Colognio from
age 9 through adolescence, opened Wednesday night at Playhouse 91
off-Broadway.
   Palminteri, who also plays 17 other parts, has learned well the
writer's lessons _ embroider on material you know and give your
story a beginning, middle and end. His ending wraps up every thread
in the story and is lavishly sentimental and it works.
   In this vividly populated Italian neighborhood in the Bronx,
nearly everybody has a nickname. In Little Johnny's bar, there's
Rudy Ice, who walks so smoothly it's like he skates on ice, and
Eddie Mush, a hard-luck gambler _ ``everything he touches turns to
mush.''
   Little Johnny, the top local mobster, makes young Colognio his
surrogate son and nicknames him C. Little Johnny tells C that the
working man is a sucker. The boy's father, an honest man who drives
a bus, says that Little Johnny is a bad man and that the working
man, who has a hard time getting up every day for work, is the real
tough guy.
   There are some surprises. When C complains to Little Johnny that
an acquaintance owes him $20 and is avoiding him, instead of Little
Johnny saying he'll rub him out, he says, ``It cost you $20 to get
rid of him. You got off cheap.''
   And there are some acting moments to be especially relished, as
C's youthfully awkward, pompous imitation of toughness and visiting
mobsters' sudden deference when they realize he is Little Johnny's
``boy.''
   In ``A Bronx Tale,'' C grows up learning from both men without
turning his back on either. The apartment house and bar-front set
and Little Johnny may be a little sugar-coated but there is murder,
fear and racial violence in ``A Bronx Tale.''
   Mark W. Travis, artistic director at Theater West in Hollywood,
where the play opened last spring, directed. James Noone designed
the very clean set. Peter Gatien and Dan Lauria produced.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas and the rightist
government of El Salvador failed at an extra day of peace talks
Wednesday to reach a truce in their 10-year-old civil war.
   Salvadoran Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, an observer at the
talks, said the the Farabundo Marti National Liberation front and
the government delegates could not agree on details for a
cease-fire. But he said they agreed to continue trying at a meeting
Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela.
   ``The two sides have agreed to continue negotiating an end to
hostilities, with both undertaking to include all specific proposal
each sides presents in the agenda at the next round,'' he said.
   Rosa Chavez said the only agreement reached at the three-day
meeting in the town of Moravia, just north of San Jose, was that a
mechanism should be set up to verify future accords are honored.
   The talks, which began Monday with a two-day schedule, had been
extended to Wednesday. But Rosa Chavez said the two sides recessed
the talks after it became apparent there was no way out of the
deadlock.
   Oscar Santamaria, who heads the government delegation, said the
guerrillas had created an ``obstacle to advancement'' by expanding
their proposal.
   The rebels ``divert the discussion from the main theme to other
elements and that number of points make it impossible to go into
the theme of an end to hostilities,'' Santamaria said.
   The guerrillas have proposed a cease-fire, a purge of the armed
forces, respect for human rights and democratic freedoms to lay the
groundwork for their formation of a legal political party.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's government has proposed an
immediate end to fighting and disbanding of rebel forces as a first
step.
   Salvador Samayoa, a rebel representative, accused the government
of inflexibility in the talks.
   ``Substantial agreements appear to be far away. The government
is not prepared to negotiate,'' Samayoa said.
   The first round of talks since Cristiani took office June 1 was
held in September in Mexico City.
   About 70,000 people have been killed in the war, the majority of
them civilians.

<TEXT>
   More than two days after a doctor asked
Jennifer Keough's parents to donate the teen-ager's organs after a
car accident, the girl scratched out a message.
   ``I wat to tak to my mom.''
   Barbara Keough had never read a sweeter message.
   ``She's still on the respirator. But that's OK. She's coming
back to me,'' Mrs. Keough said, moments after her 15-year-old
daughter waved and wrote notes to her in the girl's room at
Memorial Hospital.
   It was surprising enough that Jennifer survived Saturday night's
crash after police said she was already dead. But it was even
better news that she began moving her toes and fingers on Monday.
   At 4:55 p.m. Tuesday, intensive care nurse Ron Brezicki called
Mrs. Keough at home with more news.
   ``She did what? She wrote? Holy Cow!'' Mrs. Keough gasped,
clenching the telephone. Her friends turned.
   Screaming, hugging and hand-slapping erupted in the small
apartment.
   Minutes before he called, Brezicki noticed Jennifer stirring,
apparently pointing. He asked if she would be able to write if he
brought her paper and pencil.
   Brezicki asked Jennifer where she lived, what year it was, the
name of the president. Each time she wrote down a correct answer,
except she wrote ``Regan.'' She was reminded there had been an
election, and then she wrote ``Bush.''
   Jennifer, a student at Hollywood Hills High School, also asked
why she was in the hospital and then repeatedly asked about her
friend Jane Valaziotis, 17, who was driving when the car was hit by
another.
   Miss Valaziotis was in stable condition with a broken jaw and
bruises.
   On Saturday, Jennifer's eyes were fixed and dilated when she was
brought to the emergency room, the first sign of possible brain
damage, said Dr. Francisco Pons, who saw her at the hospital.
Another doctor helping to work on the girl asked the teen-ager's
parents to consider donating organs.
   ``Things were looking so bad, we didn't want to give the mother
any hope,'' Pons said, adding that it appeared at the time that the
girl would either die or be brain dead.
   However, Pons said the girl had a strong pulse and pretty good
blood pressure, and he wasn't going to give up on her.
   On Wednesday, Jennifer's condition was upgraded from serious to
stable condition, hospital spokeswoman Linda Hamlin said.
   When he learned of the girl's progress, Pons was visibly shocked.
   ``That's a miracle,'' he said. ``Sometimes there are happy
endings here.''

   The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have
reached preliminary agreement toward initiating the first direct
flights between Tel Aviv and Moscow, a spokesman for the Israeli
airline El Al said Wednesday.
   The mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot daily said an agreement was
reached in Moscow this week between El Al's director, Rafi Har-Lev,
and top officials of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. No starting date
for the flights was given.
   El Al spokesman Nachman Kleiman, reached by telephone, confirmed
that Har-Lev reached a preliminary deal in Moscow. But he said a
separate air agreement would also have to be reached between the
governments of the two countries.
   ``The negotiations still have to be finalized, a few more
details concluded,'' said Kleiman.
   Direct Moscow-Tel Aviv flights would help in an expected influx
of thousands of Soviet immigrants over the next few years, Israel's
consular representative in Moscow, Arieh Levine, said on Israel
television.
   Relations between Israel and East bloc nations have been
improving over the last three years. In 1987, Israel and the Soviet
Union resumed low-level diplomatic ties. Moscow broke diplomatic
ties during the 1967 Middle East War.

   A terrorist was killed on Wednesday when
a grenade he was carrying exploded near Congress hours after a
guerrilla amnesty bill was introduced which excludes pardons for
drug traffickers.
   Police said four people were wounded in the midday blast at
Bolivar Plaza in the heart of this capital, about 50 yards from the
Congress building.
   Security forces suspect that scores of bombings in the last two
months were performed by hirelings of the drug traffickers, who are
trying to force Colombia to stop extraditing people wanted as
traffickers in the United States.
   The blast occurred on the first full day of a nationwide strike
by judges, who demanded added protection from attacks mounted by
drug traffickers.
   The fragmentation grenade apparently exploded by accident
Wednesday, witnesses told the Colombian radio networks RCN and
Caracol.
   People at the scene told RCN the man killed was walking rapidly
toward the Congress building when the grenade exploded.
   RCN quoted police as saying the man was also carrying a
submachine gun.
   Nearby is the presidential palace, which serves as the official
residence of President Virgilio Barco.
   It was Barco who rejected appeals by drug traffickers to be
included in the bill that would grant amnesty to leftist guerrillas
of the April 19 Movement.
   The amnesty is part of a negotiated settlement with the rebels,
who take their name from the date of a 1970 presidential election
opponents say was fraudulent.
   The 72-hour judges' strike was declared at noon Tuesday, hours
after a federal judge was shot and killed in Medellin. He was the
42nd judge to be murdered in Colombia in 12 years.
   Drug traffickers, in a telephone call to a Medellin radio
station, said they killed the judge to retaliate for the
extradition of four Colombians to the United States to face charges
related to drug trafficking.
   Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a Medellin radio station news
director. No one claimed responsibility for the slaying, the eighth
news media employee killed since drugrunners started a major
terrorist campaign in mid-August.
   The judges' strike, which crippled Colombia's courts, was
declared by the National Association of Court Workers with 14,000
members, including judges.
   The union president, Federal Judge Helmut Romero, said in a
broadcast interview Wednesday he met the day before with Justice
Minister Roberto Salazar.
   Romero said he was told the government doesn't have money to
fund a special program created two months ago to protect judges.
   Judges who were working had no bulletproof vests, even though
the U.S. Justice Department said two weeks ago it delivered vests
as part of a $19 million program to help protect the judges.
   A union administrator, Yolanda Parra, told The Associated Press
the Justice Ministry had received only 15 vests and even those had
not been turned over to judges yet.

<TEXT>
   The American Federation of Musicians has placed
City Opera on an ``unfair list,'' barring union members nationwide
from playing for the company until a contract dispute is resolved.
   Steve Sprague, assistant to the president of the union, said the
move Tuesday was an attempt to get both sides back to the
bargaining table.
   The union's Local 802 began a strike of City Opera on Sept. 13,
opening night of the fall season. The season was canceled Oct. 12
after negotiations broke down.
   The opera was to begin a national tour in January or February.
   ``We don't know at this juncture if the opera is going to be
touring,'' Sprague said.
   The union has 200,000 members across the United States and
Canada. Any union member who plays the City Opera while it is on
the unfair list will be subject to ``internal discipline,'' Sprague
said.
   Spokesmen for the opera did not immediately return telephone
calls.

   A policeman's gun belt took a bullet
fired at the officer by a car theft suspect he was chasing, police
said. The officer returned fire, killing the man.
   The shooting Tuesday night was a rarity in this small, affluent
village less than 10 miles north of New York City, where car thefts
and burglaries are the most common crimes.
   Officer Michael Walsh stopped a car that had been reported
stolen, and was questioning its two occupants when one of them ran
off, said police Capt. Michael Garcia.
   Officer Timothy Brennan gave chase. The fleeing suspect fired a
.45-caliber pistol at the officer, but the shot hit his gun belt
and Brennan was not injured, Garcia said.
   Brennan, 25, returned fire and hit the man, who ran a short
distance and collapsed, Garcia said.

   A student mixing chemicals while riding in a

officials said.
   The children were on their way home from Oriole Park Elementary
School when one boy mixed potassium permanganate, an oxidizing and
bleaching agent that can be used as a disinfectant, with another
chemical, said Martha Tully, a spokeswoman at Resurrection Medical
Center.
   The reaction caused the bottle to explode, releasing fumes
throughout the bus.
   The bus stopped, and ambulances took the children and the bus
driver to various hospitals as a precautionary measure, hospital
officials said. The children ranged in age from 5 to 13.
   The children were released as their parents arrived to pick them
up.
   Some of the children had complained of nausea, stomach aches and
a slight burning sensation, Ms. Tully said.

<TEXT>
   Residents mourned Wednesday over lost
lives and ruined buildings in this handsome seaside city that was
closest to the epicenter of the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S.
history.
   A downtown shopping center of renovated turn-of-the-century
buildings, gardens and walkways was badly damaged during Tuesday
evening's 6.9-magnitude quake. Two people were killed.
   ``The downtown lost between 12 and 20 buildings _ the heart of
the community and its vitality,'' said Gary Patton, chairman of the
Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.
   Five people died in the county. Authorities initially said 40
buildings were damaged beyond repair, but revised that figure to
25. Water, gas and sewage lines burst. Crews restored power and
water service throughout the county Wednesday.
   Also hard-hit by the quake was Los Gatos, an affluent hillside
city in Santa Clara County, 40 miles northeast of here, where
Victorian homes were shaken off their foundations and masonry
buildings crumbled to the ground.
   ``I've got to somehow figure out how to get a ton of chimney off
my roof,'' said Peter Cifelli, who spent the night with his wife
and two daughters in their station wagon because they feared the
chimney would plunge into their home.
   The quake struck at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday along a segment of the San
Andreas Fault eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz, a college town
and popular vacation spot about 75 miles south of San Francisco.
   The temblor was the most powerful since a 7.0 quake centered in
Eureka in 1980.
   Preliminary damage estimates to Santa Cruz County alone totaled
$250 million to private property and $100 million to public
property, said Dinah Phillips, the county's emergency services
coordinator.
   In addition to the deaths in the Santa Cruz mall, one person was
killed in a traffic accident south of the city when the car struck
horses that had gotten loose on U.S. Highway 1, said Ms. Phillips.
   The other dead included a person killed in the collapse of a
bakery shop in Watsonville and an elderly nursing home patient in
Santa Cruz who died of a heart attack, Ms. Phillips said.
   Burst sewer lines sparked concerns over possible contamination
to the water supply, and residents were told to boil water.
   In Los Gatos, which bore the brunt of a moderate August
earthquake, building inspectors concentrated on the historic old
town section, where several blocks of commercial buildings and two
homes were destroyed.
   Along Main Street, buildings crumbled onto parked cars and the
sidewalks buckled.
   ``I've felt all the earthquakes since I lived here, and this was
the best one _ my best near-death experience,'' said Ray Blair, an
employee at Velomeister Cycles, who escaped through the front door
as the building's brick facade crumbled.

   Federal disaster officials, stung by criticism
they responded lackadaisically to Hurricane Hugo, moved quickly
Wednesday to speed services to earthquake victims in California.
   Less than 17 hours after an earthquake devastated the San
Francisco Bay area, President Bush declared seven counties federal
disaster areas, clearing the way for them to receive federal
assistance.
   Bush paid a surprise, morale-boosting visit to the headquarters
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency where some workers had
been up all night coordinating the disaster response.
   ``It's important that this emergency machinery operate with
total efficiency,'' Bush told reporters after he received a
30-minute briefing on how 25 federal agencies planned to deal with
the disaster.
   The president defended FEMA, whose response to Hugo was
criticized by members of Congress. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
said FEMA was a ``bunch of bureaucratic jackasses.''
   ``I thought the response to Hugo was very good,'' Bush told
reporters. ``You can never avoid all criticism.''
   One difference between Hugo, which resulted in disaster
declarations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, South
Carolina and North Carolina, and the earthquake was planning,
according to Grant Peterson, FEMA's associate director.
   As recently as last August, the agency, along with state and
local officials, staged a dress rehearsal for an earthquake in
northern California.
   ``We were ready, we practiced for this event, we came on line
very quickly,'' he said.
   But he acknowledged the earthquake came at a bad time for FEMA,
a month after the devastation wreaked by Hugo.
   ``We do have the resources, but we are stressed,'' he said.
Peterson said the agency intends to use some of the $1.1 billion
appropriated by Congress for Hugo to cover earthquake-related
losses.
   Lawmakers will have to replenish the disaster pool when money
runs shorts, as it is expected to do, Peterson said.
   Asked how much will to needed for the earthquake, Peterson said,
``I don't know the cost of this disaster and no one else does.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle said he discussed the importance of
preparation with President Bush by telephone from Air Force Two on
his way back to Washington from inspecting the damage in San
Francisco.
   ``It could have been much worse if we had not had that
preparation,'' Quayle told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington.
   ``I do believe it's under control and we are making progress,''
Quayle said.
   He said he also told the president about the importance of
volunteers who swarmed to help the injured and homeless.
   Shortly after the earthquake struck, FEMA personnel set up an
office in San Francisco's Presidio area to supervise federal relief
efforts.
   Other federal disaster offices will open soon to handle requests
from the public. Federal assistance can include temporary housing,
grants of up to $10,000 a family and low-cost loans to cover
uninsured private and business property losses. Red Cross officials
said hundreds of people stayed in federal shelters overnight.
   Local governments can receive money to pay part of the cost of
debris removal and for the replacement of damaged public property.
   California Gov. George Deukmajian activated the National Guard
and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered military hospitals to
treat civilian casualties.
   Among the other federal relief efforts:
   _The Environmental Protection Agency took steps to contain oil
spillage in Richmond, Calif. EPA spokesman Jim Makris said no
environmental contamination had been found and workers at nuclear
plants were confident reactors had not been damaged.
   _The FBI was on call to help identify bodies.
   _The U.S. Geological Survey sent teams to determine the exact
nature of the quake.
   _The Department of Health and Human Services put a team on
stand-by alert even though health facilities were thought to be
sufficient.
   _The Department of Agriculture freed up federal food stored in
warehouses for the school lunch program.

   An opean apart but linked by deep sensitivity to

the San Francisco area. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu offered today
to help in rescue and rebuilding efforts.
   Kaifu said he was ``deeply saddened'' by Tuesday's disaster.
   ``As we ourselves are so vulnerable to this natural disaster
that we view the fate of its victims much as that of our own ... we
are following the news from San Francisco with intense care,'' he
said in a message to President Bush.
   ``We are prepared to contribute to your efforts of emergency

   President Bush, dispatching top administration
officials to California for a quick survey of earthquake damage, is
pledging the federal government will ``do everything that it
possibly can to help'' in the recovery from the devastation.
   Within a few hours of the quake, the bureaucracy was in motion,
from Bush's decision to send Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner
flying overnight to California to the establishment of a command
center at the Federal Emergency Management Agency a few blocks from
the White House.
   ``Obviously, we've already started moving,'' said FEMA's Grant
Peterson. ``We're not waiting to respond, we're responding right
now,'' he added as the agency strove to avoid the criticism it
reaped for its response to Hurricane Hugo last month.
   National Guard spokesman Dan Donohue said two California Air
National Guard units were being activated and would send
helicopters, rescue and recovery aircraft and cargo planes to the
San Francisco area.

   Federal subsidies that keep commuter airlines
flying into 21 small towns from Temple, Texas, to Benton Harbor,
Mich., are on the verge of elimination, a casualty of budgetary
warfare.
   ``If we lose the subsidy ... Mansfield loses air service,'' said
Ralph Baker, vice president of GCS Air Services, which has shuttled
passengers from Mansfield, Ohio, to Cleveland since February 1988.
The company has lost money on the route despite the federal
assistance, Baker said.
   ``This is going to be a drastic blow to us,'' said John
Chaddock, manager of Twin Cities Airport, which serves Benton
Harbor and St. Joseph, Mich.

   Bush is expected to sign the measure soon so that aid can begin

   Hard-line East German leader Erich Honecker, who
oversaw the building of the Berlin Wall, stepped down Wednesday and
was replaced by a younger Communist Party loyalist amid growing
unrest and calls for democratic reform.
   Two other ruling Politburo members also lost their jobs in a

but changes from Honecker's course were unlikely.
   Communist Party leaders have made clear they will resist
pro-democracy movements like those under way in Warsaw Pact allies
Poland and Hungary, which on Wednesday approved constitutional

   Radon is colorless, odorless and radioactive gas produced by the

<HEAD>Newest National Park Plans Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The youngest national park has barely taken
its first steps and already visitors are worrying like
overprotective parents about the future of its soaring mountains,
4,000-year-old trees and mysterious caves.
   More than 600 people have commented on a proposed 10-year
management plan for Great Basin National Park, said supervisor Al
Hendricks. ``The comments we received tended quite heavily toward
protection and preservation. For the most part, people are not
looking to build water slides, pave things over. ... They didn't
want Great Basin to turn into a Yosemite, which is overdeveloped.
There's even a bank in Yosemite. It's practically a small city.''
   The plan was to go to Congress this month, three years after the
77,109-acre park's Oct. 27, 1986, dedication. It probably won't be
done for six months or more, though Congress will be informed of
the status, he said.
   Attendance is still low at the park in eastern Nevada. Its
75,000 visitors in 1988 was up 83 percent from 41,000 in 1986;
Hendricks expects 75,000 this year. More than 3.3 million saw
761,757-acre Yosemite National Park in 1988.
   ``We are remote,'' Hendricks explained. ``You kind of have to
think twice about getting in the car and driving out here. But it's
worth it. It's one of the last preserved places in the Great
Basin.''
   Most of those who commented agreed with Hendricks.
   ``Great Basin is a gem: a small glimpse into the past that
hasn't been trampled by the hand of man,'' said one visitor. ``I
believe we should make every effort to preserve it as a testament
to the old American West.''
   ``Please do not go on a building spree, paving over paradise to
put up parking lots,'' said another.
   ``If it's not broken don't fix it,'' implored a third.
   Amid the anti-development comments collected in 1987 were
statements from recreational vehicle enthusiasts and urban dwellers
who want creature comfort more than backwoods hardship when they
commune with nature.
   ``If you make Wheeler Peak campground inaccessible to us we will
lose all interest in Great Basin National Park,'' said the operator
of a mobile home.
   ``Our RV was dirtier after a short visit to the park in June
than in the rest of our 6,000-mile trip,'' complained a visitor.
``Please pave major roads and camp areas. You have so much land
that more should be developed.''
   Hendricks said the plan would emphasize preservation of the
park, but also would include some new campgrounds and access for
visitors. ``You have to try and accommodate as many people as you
can.''
   Ranchers will be included in the plan despite numerous negative
comments that cattle and other livestock should be run out.
   ``Congress put into the law that grazing would be allowed and
unless they change the law there's nothing we can do about it,''
Hendricks said.
   Great Basin was the 49th national park dedicated in the United
States and the first one to receive the designation in 15 years.
   Highlights include 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, second in Nevada
only to 13,140-foot Boundary Peak; Lehman Caves National Monument's
square mile of limestone formations; and acres of
4,000-plus-year-old bristlecone pine trees, grotesquely contorted
from battling wind, sand and ice over the ages to become the oldest
known living things on Earth.
   Steep-walled glacial lakes and narrow canyons also are among
park features that include Lexington Arch, a 70-foot high,
83-foot-wide stretch on which American Indians left primitive
pictrographs.
   The tiny town of Baker is the closest residential area to the
park and has two small motels with about a dozen rooms. The larger
town of Ely some 70 miles away has more amenities such as shopping
and more motel rooms.
   Park operators offered four 10-year plans, ranging from leaving
most of the park alone to developing miles of new roads, shuttle
services and parking lots.
   Nearly three-fourths of the people who commented said they
preferred two proposals that didn't include much new development.
   Those two alternatives call for construction of a Great Basin
interpretive center at Baker Ridge, access roads to the center, and
a 100-car parking lot for those visiting Lehman Caves.
   But the proposals don't include new developments or maintained
roads for vehicles further into the park's unspoiled areas.
   Two other alternatives propose more deep-park vehicle access,
including public roads leading to 11,658-foot Mount Washington, and
generally prefer much more modern and rural zoning to primitive and
semiprimitive designations.
   ``Most of the facilities we have now were built back when Lehman
Caves became a national monument in 1922, so we do actually need
some updated facilities,'' Hendricks said.
   Nonetheless, a third of the comments urged relocating housing,
maintenance and administration facilities to Baker to better
preserve Great Basin.
   ``We got comments on the far side of preservation and
development,'' Hendricks said. ``We just have to find a middle
ground.''
   Most respondents want more access to some areas that already
have some roads, but don't want maintained roads to areas where
people usually hike. Most want limited service camping in areas
that already have some campgrounds, but not in others. ``We want
another four campgrounds in the park because now we don't have
enough space,'' Hendricks said.
   On other issues, two-thirds of the respondents opposed
hang-gliding and snowmobiling in the park and a third said
cross-country skiing routes shouldn't be maintained. Most said
fishing should be allowed, but only on a catch-and-release basis,
and that hunting should be strictly forbidden.
   They encouraged reintroduction of elk and restoration of
endangered bald eagle and peregrine falcon populations and leaving
predator populations alone to control mule deer and other wild
herds.
   ``Whatever improvements we make ... a lot of the park is going
to remain mountainous territory available for hiking,'' Hendricks
said. ``I wouldn't say the park is exactly like it was in 1922, but
it's close, pretty preserved.''

<HEAD>State-Produced TV Coverage of Oil Spill Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scenes of Alaska's oiled beaches and the
cleanup of Prince William Sound have been telecast into millions of
homes worldwide via Gov. Steve Cowper's state-funded news service.
   In the six months since the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Cowper has
expanded his video-production staff and provided hundreds of
television stations with raw footage and edited stories about the
spill and its effects.
   During the departure of Exxon's cleanup crews from Valdez,
Cowper's staff offered via satellite a series of free ``news
packages'' _ known in the TV news business as video news releases,
or VNRs.
   Critics say VNRs distort the news-selection process and often
give viewers a biased view of an event.
   The state's videos have become one of Cowper's most powerful
tools to sway public opinion. Alaska has sued Exxon over the March
24 spill and is lobbying Congress to pass stronger spill-liability
legislation.
   ``The only way we can get decisions made that we believe are
necessary is through public pressure, and that's how we get public
pressure,'' Cowper said recently. ``It's unfortunate that's the way
we have to do business, but it's also effective. It works.''
   When Cowper arrived in Valdez to announce the state's winter
cleanup plan on the final day of Exxon's pullout, he displayed an
impressive video with aerial shots of oiled beaches.
   That night's ``NBC Nightly News'' led its story on the pullout
with scenes and narration from the video. The narrator, Cowper
spokesman Terence O'Malley, was ecstatic.
   The network noted the beach scenes were shot just days before
and it ``picked up on the term `Dirty Dozen' _ the 12 beaches that
represent why Exxon needs to come back,'' O'Malley said.
   ``You just can't get any better than that.''
   NBC clearly identified the source of the video and followed it
with a report by its correspondent in Valdez.
   It's on cost-conscious local stations, however, where the
state's footage is most likely to be seen, sometimes without
attribution.
   At least 29 stations and news-distribution networks from San
Francisco to New York used the state's VNRs during a three-day
period in September, according to a state-commissioned survey.
   ``Of course, some of them had ethical problems with state-funded
video,'' said Steve Nelson, who helped produce the VNRs. ``But I
would say that was a very small minority. Once they saw the quality
and content of the product, most of them were very happy to utilize
it.''
   Nine two-minute stories have been produced, on topics such as
``spill stress,'' Exxon's beach-cleaning techniques, and the
effects of the spill on fishermen and natives. Each package
includes raw footage and edited stories, duplicated with and
without narration.
   O'Malley narrates most of the stories but does not appear on
camera. He identifies himself by name but not as Cowper's press
aide. That, he said, allows the stations to present him as their
own correspondent.
   The reports are not overtly slanted against Exxon _ which hired
a New York firm to produce its own spill VNRs.
   A state video on an Exxon dispersant was largely positive, and
in some reports Exxon officials were interviewed.
   ``That's why we think that they've been so successful,''
O'Malley said. ``The reporting is basically pretty unbiased.''
   Biased or not, VNRs affect news selection, said Ben Bagdikian, a
professor of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   ``If you get on a news program because you happen to provide
free, technically high-quality footage, you have displaced
something else that an independent editor might have thought more
important,'' he said.
   When stations fail to identify the source of VNR material, he
added, ``it's clearly unethical and very close to corruption of the
news.''
   Few news producers flatly reject using VNRs.
   ``If it's quality and not a blatant ad, we sometimes will use
it,'' said Kathryn Scott, assignment manager for ``USA Today on
TV,'' a nationally syndicated news show.
   Most of the stations contacted by The Associated Press said they
used the state's footage to illustrate their own stories. For some
the subject of VNRs was too sensitive to discuss.
   Wayne Brown, executive news producer at KGTV in San Diego, said
he used a few of the stories but ``edited them down'' and
identified the source. ``It enabled us to continue to update the
story that we had covered,'' he said.
   ``What I really used them for was intellegence, to find out what
was newsworthy from an Alaskan point of view,'' said John Davidow,
a producer at WCVB in Boston.
   Still, he said his station is unlikely to use them. ``When all's
said and done, these weren't news stories. They were press
releases.''

<HEAD>Gramm-Rudman Cuts Unlikely to Cause Lasting Spending Reductions</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So the budget ax has fallen on the government
in an act of self-punishment required by law _ but it is more
likely to bounce than to inflict real and lasting cuts in spending.
   That's the way it has worked before under the system of
deadlines and scaled-down deficit ceilings that is supposed to lead
to a balanced budget in 1993. A combination of cuts, revenue
increases and adroit bookkeeping got the numbers within deficit
limits in Senate and House budget bills required by mid-month. But
Congress couldn't settle on a final version in time to meet the
deadline.
   As a result, President Bush ordered sequestration, the fancy
name for $16.1 billion in automatic spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman act Congress passed in 1985 as a way to try to force
itself and the administration to deal with the deficit. Congress is
trying to agree on a budget bill that will squeeze the projected
deficit under the limit and supplant the automatic cuts.
   Since the Gramm-Rudman system was enacted, the annual deficit
ceilings it sets have been eased and some costly programs,
including part of the savings and loan bailout, have been designed
to avoid even those limits. One sponsor of the plan, Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., thinks it has become a sham.
   But the rebuttal is that it beats nothing.
   ``If that law were not in place, federal spending would be
higher today and deficits would be higher today,'' said Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H. His coauthor, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex., said
complaints about the measure are like ``the drunk criticizing the
wrench because he can't fix the faucet.''
   That less-than-elegant image is apt for a system devised to
substitute for the political discipline neither Democrats nor
Republicans, neither Congress nor the administration, were imposing
on themselves.
   President Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, forbids new
taxes. The administration ruled out sharp cuts in defense spending.
Democrats are equally determined to protect domestic program
budgets, notably for the entitlement programs that pay benefits to
individual Americans.
   That adds up to the standoff that led to the Gramm-Rudman
measure, to squeeze down the deficits with progressively lower
ceilings. The target for the government year that began Oct. 1 is a
deficit no higher than $110 billion. It gets a lot tougher next
year, when the target is $64 billion, if it sticks.
   There already is talk of change.
   One way out would be to alter the scorekeeping system so as to
exclude from the deficit arithmetic a growing surplus in the Social
Security trust fund, $68 billion this year. That covers more than
half the deficit in the government's operating budget.
   The amendment now favored by Democratic congressional leaders
would stop counting that surplus, which means operating deficits
would be far higher, and at the same time raise the annual deficit
limits and set 1997 as the target year for a balanced budget.
   But first the government has to cope with the current situation.
The automatic cuts were supposed to be a sort of doomsday mechanism
that would prod the two branches of government into cooperating to
reduce deficits. But this is the third time the sequester sanction
has been imposed, even with the gimmicks that have been used to get
budgets under the Gramm-Rudman limits.
   ``Has the Congress cheated? Has the president, in the best
spirit of bipartisanship, worked with the Congress to cheat?''
Gramm asked. ``The answer is yes.
   ``But are we better off with Gramm-Rudman than we would be
without it? I think the answer is yes, clearly yes,'' he said
Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   Richard G. Darman, the budget director, says Congress has made
past sequester orders into phonies by rescinding them and putting
all the money back. He's talking about spending cuts that would
stick, even after Congress and the administration settle on a
permanent budget measure. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, agrees, saying that spending cuts
should be permanent and painful.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
automatic cuts aren't all bad. ``There would be sizeable cuts and
they would be real,'' he said. ``There wouldn't be any accounting
changes. they'd be real money that wouldn't be spent.''
   But the Gramm-Rudman formula would hit programs the
administration doesn't want cut along with some it would like
reduced. Social Security, aid to the needy and other major federal
spending items are exempt from the cuts, and some other
expenditures, including Medicare, can't be cut by more than 2
percent. What's left is a 4.3 percent cut in defense spending and a
5.3 percent reduction in other domestic programs.
   That gives everybody a stake in a settlement that undoes most if
not all of the automatic cuts. Until next time.

<HEAD>In the Center of the Storm: Junk Bond Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the financial markets gyrate amid worries
about high-risk takeover debt, small savers and investors need not
feel left out of the action.
   They can get in on the game simply by putting their money in a
mutual fund that owns a portfolio of high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds
of the type used to finance many corporate buyouts in recent years.
   Whether anyone would want to get involved in such a chancy
proposition, of course, is another question entirely.
   The market for junk bonds has been unsettled for months now, and
lately it has suffered a series of setbacks. The most recent came
just a few days ago when a group planning to buy UAL Corp. said
bankers had balked at financing the deal.
   Even in the best of times, junk bonds must offer higher yields
than other, higher-quality securities in order to attract
investors. In periods like now of heightened uncertainty, the yield
differential naturally tends to widen.
   Thus, junk bond mutual funds today sport yields in the 13
percent to 14.5 percent range, compared to roughly 7.5 percent to
8.5 percent for funds that concentrate on safer investments like
U.S. Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed against default by the
federal government.
   On a $10,000 investment, that's a difference in interest
payments (technically called dividends when they are distributed by
a mutual fund) of some $550 to $600 a year.
   Is that disparity enough to justify taking the risks that come
with junk bonds? It all depends, financial advisers say, on your
ability to withstand losses and your view of the economic outlook.
   Just about everybody agrees that junk bond funds are a bad
choice for conservative investors who depend on reliable income,
and safety of principal, to cover their costs of living.
   Even willing risk-takers have to be wary of some potentially
misleading impressions before they can make a sensible appraisal of
the risks and rewards in the junk market.
   First of all, points out Norman Fosback, editor of the
newsletter Income &amp; Safety, the nominal yield cited at any given
time for a portfolio of junk bonds must be considered an
exaggeration.
   ``Many of the high-yield issues are bound to default,'' he says.
``Indeed, their ultrahigh yield is both a recognition of that
inevitability and a compensation for the corresponding risk.''
   As a rule of thumb, a prospective buyer might subtract 3
percentage points from the stated annual yield to allow for
defaults.
   Another variable that can hurt the return on a junk bond
portfolio is a decline in prices. This can occur even in a period
when interest rates are steady or falling, if confidence in the
market suffers as it has this year.
   According to Donoghue's Moneyletter, three of the biggest junk
bond funds, carrying stated yields of 12.8 percent to 14.5 percent,
actually managed to post ``total returns'' of only 5.4 percent to
5.6 percent for the first nine months of 1989.
   You could have done better than that in any one of numerous
other, much less risky investments.
   Donoghue's concludes, ``The premiums the funds are now paying
over Treasury yields are large, but they should be. The funds are
no bargain now.''
   Fosback, by contrast, argues that junk-bond funds have fallen so
deeply into disfavor that they have some appeal for venturesome
investors of a ``contrarian'' bent.
   He contends that it may be a good time to buy them ``if you can
stand the fluctuations and the excitement.''
   One long-time bear on junk bonds, James Grant, argues that the
very expression ``high yield'' embodies much that is wrong with the
financial world right now.
   ``What investors have chased in the 1980s is yield _ not total
return, but promised rates of interest,'' he observes in his
Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ``Promoters have sold it and
investors have bought it.''

<HEAD>Keeping Order In The House of Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When 1,700 mutual funds and an array of pension
funds, trusts, foundations, endowments and other institutions seek
to buy or sell from a list of perhaps 3,500 listed stocks you can
have problems.
   One of those problems is illiquidity, or the inability to match
buyers with sellers within a limited time and without allowing
prices to surge or plunge. Liquidity is fluid, orderly; illiquidity
is spastic, volatile.
   Liquidity depends on a randomness of opinion, on a mixture of
buyers and sellers with differing ideas about what to buy or sell
at any particuular time.
   It is the very basis of successful securities markets _ bringing
buyers and sellers together _ and officials of the big exchanges
have made many speeches lauding the ability of their outfits to do
just that.
   But, in recent years its occasional and dramatic absences have
created financial earthquakes, with prices plunging or surging
because everyone wanted to sell or everyone wanted to buy at the
same time.
   While the number of institutional investors has grown, the
growth of individuals who invest directly has not, a trend not
helped by the big crash two years ago. Institutions have changed
their personality too. They have become more active traders, rather
than investors.
   As a result, the overwhelming volume of buying and selling on
almost any day now is institutional rather than individual.
Individuals haven't deserted the securities markets altogether, but
many prefer to invest through funds.
   Federal Reserve records show that since 1968 households have
been net sellers of stocks in all but one year. In that time,
household financial assets held as common stocks have shrunk to
19.6 percent from 43.4 percent.
   In 1984, households reduced their direct ownership by $75.6
billion, in 1985 by $103.4 billion, in 1986 by $121.6 billion, in
1987 by $99.3 billion and in 1988 by $105.5 billion. The annual
rate this year is higher.
   Who has been buying? Foreigners for one, though they lost some
enthusiasm last year and this. Mutual funds, of course, although
they too lightened up last year. But most of all, state-local
government retirement funds.
   Why the latter are such eager buyers isn't quite clear, but they
have been consistent. From 1984 through 1988 they added $111.5
billion to their holdings, and they have continued their buying
into 1989.
   What these numbers add up to is a trend toward less randomness
of opinion in the marketplace. Offsetting the potentially volatile
effects of this concentration, at least to some unmeasurable
extent, has been technology.
   Seeking to maintain liquidity, major exchanges have greatly
expanded their capacity to handle not just higher volume but
explosions of volume and sudden turns. Exchanges have vastly more
capacity than just a few years ago.
   Technology, however, has opposite impacts too, one of them being
the speed with which huge sellers, or combinations of them, can
suddenly dump stocks onto the market, often by the automatic
trigger of a computer program.
   Defenders of the marketplace cite what they say has been a
relatively low average level of illiquidity _ regardless of
outbursts _ and that big markets naturally tend to produce big
numbers of every sort, gains and losses included.
   But until those outbursts of illiquidity are tamed to a greater
degree, it seems unlikely that individuals will reverse their
long-term trend and return to direct ownership of stocks.
   And that leaves the markets to deal with the question of how to
tame the bursts of illiquidity when so many powerful buyers and
sellers think alike about the same small list of stocks.

   When school officials told 10-year-old
Audrey Pearson she couldn't read the Bible on the school bus, the
girl's mother turned for help to the Rutherford Institute.
   Within days, Audrey was back reading her Bible on the bus.
   The Rutherford Institute is devoted to religious free speech.
``I want this group to be a beacon of light for people who give
up,'' said John W. Whitehead, who founded the institute in his
basement here in 1982. ``There's just a myth out there if it's on
public property, it can't be religious.''
   Although Audrey's case took only a few telephone calls, the
Rutherford Institute has successfully defended cases to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   In seven years, the institute has grown to 21 state chapters
across the country and has an annual budget of $800,000. Forty
staff attorneys handled 75 cases last year, up from 40 cases the
year before, Whitehead said.
   The institute, which has helped people recently in Nigeria,
Canada and India, plans to open offices overseas, Whitehead said.
The institute recently moved to Charlottesville.
   Michael Patrick, executive director of the institute, said it
averages 25 calls for help a day and is defending 600 people now.
That does not include calls seeking information and educational
materials, he said.
   Ellen Pearson said she heard about the institute after reading
an essay by Whitehead in a book, ``Biblical Principles for Godly
Living,'' and remembered it when her daughter was forbidden to read
the Bible.
   She said she first tried to send Audrey to school with a lap
desk, dolls and other items to entertain herself on the one-hour
ride and was told they were unsafe.
   ``I said I am going to let her bring books to school and I said
because she loves God's word she probably will bring God's word,''
Mrs. Pearson said. ``The teacher got quiet and she called me back
in five minutes and said the principal said she couldn't bring
that.''
   Mrs. Pearson said she called the principal of Dumfries
Elementary School, Nicolette Rinaldo, who said she knew that a rule
somewhere said children could not bring Bibles to school.
   An institute attorney called school officials to straighten out
the matter.
   ``I didn't think it was handled any differently than any other
formal request to the principal,'' Mrs. Rinaldo said. ``You're
talking about religious material, and normally children don't bring
religious material to school.''
   ``The root of it is fear and a lack of knowledge,'' Patrick
said. ``It (the book) could have been a Stephen King novel.''
   The group operates largely on donations from people who have
heard about the institute; Patrick said 90 percent of donations are
less than $100 and most are for $10 or $15.
   None of the institute's 40 staff attorneys is salaried. Their
expenses are paid by grants from the national group, Patrick said.
   One case the institute took successfully to the Supreme Court
involved an Illinois man who refused a job because religious
beliefs prevented him from working Sundays. In March, the high
court ruled in William Frazee's favor, overturning a ruling from
the Appellate Court of Illinois. The lower court had ruled that
Frazee's personal religious convictions did not constitute good
cause for declining a job. Frazee had been denied unemployment
benefits.
   ``The sad part is, for every one of these there's a dozen that
go unreported,'' Patrick said. He said the institute is trying to
dispel a notion that religious speech is less free than other
speech.
   ``If it's really a free-speech position, why should I be
concerned about what kind of free speech?'' Patrick said. ``We're
only as free as the rights of the least free _ religious people.''
   With that idea in mind, the institute has defended points of
view that might seem surprising.
   Whitehead said the institute once assisted a Virginia man who
wanted to put ``atheist'' on his license tag. The state
Transportation Department told the man he could not.
   ``It's a church-state issue,'' Whitehead said. ``If you can't
put `atheist' on a license plate, you can't put `theist.'''
   Barry Lynn, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the Rutherford Institute ``is much more willing than
the Constitution is to allow government support for religious
activity'' such as allowing religious clubs to meet in public
schools.
   ``They obviously have a right to promote their view of the
Constitution,'' Lynn said. ``In many instances, it is fundamentally
different from ours and fundamentally wrong.
   ``What they like to say is all speech is the same,'' Lynn said.
``It's not. You have to be more careful of any appearance of
government sponsorship for religious activities.''
   Of Audrey Pearson, Lynn said, ``That's probably a case where
we're on the same side. Individual religious experiences in a
public place do not necessarily violate the Constitution.''
   Benton Miller, manager of marketing and public affairs for
Conservative Digest and a former staffer at the Christian
Broadcasting Network, praised the institute for educating people
about religious liberties.
   ``It's hard to be involved in the issues unless you understand
the issues enough to make a difference,'' Miller said.

   Three Minnesota bishops have pledged to
develop a covenant to formalize good relations, encourage ties
between parishes and possibly help intermarried families.
   The agreement was announced recently by Archbishop John Roach of
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Bishop
Lowell Erdahl of the St. Paul Area Synod of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, and Bishop David Olson of the
Minneapolis Area Synod.
   The bishops said they hope a committee of 12 can develop the
covenant in a year. The archdiocese has about 640,000 members, the
synods about 356,000.
   Catholic-Lutheran covenants have been signed in Chicago and

   Stock markets around the world appeared to be
stabilizing heading into today's trading after a Friday the 13th
shock that caused the second-biggest point drop ever in the Dow
Jones 30-stock industrial average.
   The Dow Jones average lost a moderate 19 points Tuesday after
weathering a late-morning scare that briefly sent it down more than
60 points.
   Tuesday's action was relatively calm after the average plummeted
190 points Friday and then bounced back 88 points Monday.
   Stocks lost little ground Tuesday in spite of continued
uncertainty surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL Corp. and a
government report showing a bigger-than-expected trade deficit in
August. The Federal Reserve helped by adding a modest amount of
reserves to the banking system.
   The Dow average closed with a loss of 18.65 points at 2,638.73,
with 224.07 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
scarcely more than half Monday's volume.
   In morning trading today in Tokyo, the key Nikkei index rose
moderately.
   Still, traders said the markets were not fully back to normal.
   ``The markets moving as they are here, very emotionally, all
around the world _ it's very difficult really to put any logic
behind the movements,'' said Chung Lew, chief stock trader at the
securities firm Kleinwort Benson Inc. in New York.
   UAL, which made speculators rich on the way up, made a lot of
them poor on the way back down. The stock fell $24.87{ to close at
$198 a share _ two-thirds of its recent peak of $294 a share.
   Traders said the drop in UAL helped drag down the overall
market, which had been pumped up partly by speculation that a
seemingly endless round of debt-financed takeovers would ratchet
stock prices higher.
   The employee-management group that wants to buy the parent of
United Airlines was still trying to put together a deal to replace
the $300-a-share buyout proposal that fell apart last week, sending
the market into its Friday the 13th swoon.
   Most traders said the big trade deficit, while bad news, had
relatively little effect on the market. The Commerce Department
said the August deficit rose about 31 percent to $10.77 billion
from a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   The dollar spiked downward but quickly recovered after the trade
report in a surprising show of strength that helped soothe
investors in the stock market. Bonds gave up some early gains to
finish mixed.
   The Federal Reserve pumped $1.5 billion into the banking system
to make sure banks had enough reserves to make emergency loans to
any traders who lost big in the market's gyrations. It had injected
$2 billion in reserves Monday.
   By adding reserves the Federal Reserve is cheering up investors
who say the central bank has endangered the economy by being too
stingy with the money supply. But the Fed has acted very cautiously
and there has been no decisive downward move in the federal funds
rate, which it influences. This rate is the interest charged when a
bank loans money overnight to another bank to enable it to meet
reserve requirements.
   At times it appeared Tuesday that the stock market was being
pulled around by the stock-index futures market in Chicago, where
rises and falls tend to be exaggerated because it takes less money
to bet on the direction of the market. The swings in Chicago were
transmitted to the stock market in New York through computerized
program trading that exploited price discrepancies between them.

   Bankers Trust New York Corp., one of the largest
U.S. banks, said it set aside an additional $1.6 billion to cover
possibly bad Third World loans, drastically reducing its exposure
to risky debts.
   The move Tuesday by the nation's eighth-largest banking company
will result in a third-quarter loss of $1.42 billion, as well as a
still-undetermined loss for all of 1989. A detailed earnings report
is scheduled to be released Monday.
   Bankers Trust's decision mirrors action taken recently by a
handful of other big banks, which also reported big quarterly
losses.
   Bankers Trust and the others attributed their protective moves
to intensifying political and economic problems in debtor nations,
such as Argentina and Brazil, as well as a growing sentiment in
Washington toward forgiving some past debts.
   ``Recent events, including the outcome of Mexican debt
negotiations and the periodic suspensions of timely payments of
interest by other countries ... had the effect of reducing the
value of LDC loans,'' Chairman Charles S. Sanford Jr. said in a
statement.
   ``While reduction of interest and principal can allow time for
adjustment, only sound economic policies on the part of debtor
countries can provide a solution.''
   The $1.6 billion special provision brings Bankers Trust's
allowance for credit losses to $2.9 billion, or around 85 percent
of its medium- to long-term outstanding Third World loans.
   That's the second-largest percentage, behind J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.,
which said in September it had bolstered reserves cover all
medium-to long-term loans.
   The average percentage of protection among most banks that have
loaned money to Third World countries is 58 percent.
   Analysts say that many of the major banks that have begun facing
up to the likelihood of huge losses of loans to developing
countries, known as LDC loans, are unlikely to resume large-scale
lending to those nations for many years.
   Bankers Trust said in its statement that it would ``continue to
apply its merchant banking skills in ways that are useful to the
public and private sectors'' of Third World countries. However, it
made no mention of lending more money.

   A computer ``worm'' that sends an anti-nuclear

flashes a message saying:
   Worms Against Nuclear Killers
   Your System Has Been Officially WANKed
   The network links a wide range of universities and government
installations such as NASA and Defense Department research centers,
but none of the computers on it are involved in top-secret work,
Tencati said Tuesday.
   The worm was spotted early Monday, soon after the triggering of
a rare but harmful virus last Friday. That virus, known as
Datacrime or Columbus Day, attacked personal computers, not the big
computers affected by the worm.
   The Wank worm has not caused damage to any NASA installation _
especially the Kennedy Space Center, which is preparing to launch
the shuttle Atlantis on Wednesday _ according to Charles Redmond, a
NASA spokesman.
   ``No secret data, no classified data, nothing of a national
security nature has been violated,'' Redmond said.
   The worm can only get into computers whose users have neglected
fairly basic security procedures, such as keeping their passwords
different from their user names, Tencati said.
   Security at most computer centers is good enough that the worm
should not spread too widely, he said.
   The worm attacks a network of Digital Equipment Corp.'s Vax
computers known as DECnet Internet. That network is similar to but
separate from the main Internet network, which was attacked last
year by a worm created by a Cornell University graduate student.
   Besides flashing its anti-nuclear message, the worm frightens
computer users by making them think incorrectly that their files
have been deleted. It also scrambles passwords and flashes short
fortune cookie-style messages to other, uninfected computers.
   The main components of the DECnet Internet are the
NASA-administered Space Physics Analysis Network, with about 5,500
computers, and its European counterpart, the European Space Physics
Analysis Network, with about 500; as well as the High Energy
Physics Network, with about 8,000 computers, and its European
counterpart, European HEPnet, with about 1,000.
   The worm gets into the computers through a ``backdoor'' opening
in the software program designed to let users do some tailoring on
their computers for their own purposes.
   The U.S. government previously advised users to close the
opening, but many have not done so because the software change in
computers takes about two hours to perform, Redmond said.
   Several of the 99 messages that the worm can broadcast are
racially or ethnically offensive, said Michael Alexander, a
reporter for Computerworld, a weekly newspaper, who researched the
issue.

<HEAD>Market Whipsawed Amid Program Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after 10 a.m. Monday, a stock futures
contract tracking 20 big corporations shot higher in Chicago.
   Boom.
   A wave of computer-generated program trading orders to buy
stocks kicked in and the broader stock market stampeded upward. In
a stunning 15-minute reversal, the Dow Jones industrials average
moved from 63 points down to 6 points up.
   The gyrations from the market's Friday the 13th plunge showed
that big swings in the Chicago futures market can translate into
equally large movements in the stocks in New York via computerized
program trading, which was widely criticized for worsening the 1987
stock market crash.
   ``They kept pushing as the day went on,'' Donald Selkin, head of
stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said Tuesday. ``The programs I'd say we're a good part of the
advance.''
   The practice of moving millions of shares of stock with
lightning speed was voluntarily limited by stock exchanges and
brokerage houses in the wake of the Oct. 19, 1987, crash, but
gradually has been revived this year.
   After Friday's 190-point decline, some analysts speculated that
the New York Stock Exchange over the weekend encouraged firms to
avoid using computerized ``sell'' programs that could spur a
disastrous plunge, but to step in with buy orders if possible that
could propel the market higher. The exchange declined to comment on
the matter Tuesday.
   Program trading is a strategy involving the stock-index futures
market in Chicago and stock trading in New York. Stock-index
futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of stocks at specified
prices by a specified date.
   In one form called index arbitrage, the strategy employs
computers to buy and sell huge blocks of stocks and index futures
in an attempt to profit from minute differences in prices on the
two markets. The practice can cause rapid price swings and is
believed by some to have accelerated the 1987 market collapse.
   But defenders complain that the strategy is used as a scapegoat
for sometime-normal market fluctuations.
   ``There's always fish in a tidal wave because there's always
fish in the water,'' said R. Steven Wunsch, vice president of
financial futures at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., one of Wall Street's
heaviest program trading firms.
   ``Buyers and sellers in an outright fashion move markets,'' he
said. ``Those who are buying and selling simultaneously don't cause
volatility. Taken all together it's a non-influence.''
   Wunsch instead blamed market volatility on an overdependence on
intermediate dealers whose job is to bring together buyers and
sellers.
   A presidential task force known as the Brady Commission that
invesigated the 1987 crash concluded that index arbitagers were
active at times of big price swings but didn't cause the crash.
   After the crash, some firms reduced their program trading levels
because of intense criticism by politicians and others _ Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. abandoned the practice altogether _ but there
has been a revival this year, officials said.
   The sharp price swings Friday and Monday intensified debate over
index arbitrage. NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said program
trading accounted for 24 million of 100 million shares traded in
the final 1{ hours of trading Friday.
   ``We would say that it was abundant, but we wouldn't say it was
something that precipitated the market decline,'' he said.
   When the markets opened Monday, stock-index futures were trading
at a discount to the underlying stocks. Stock prices sank in the
first half-hour of trading. Buying of Major Market Index futures of
the 20 stocks soon pulled the futures market higher, and buy
programs kicked in. A similar action triggered buying on ``Terrible
Tuesday,'' Oct. 20, 1987.
   Some players said Wall Street's major brokerages should step in
with programs to help stem a decline.
   ``I think they should be in there all the time taking the market
up,'' said John J. Cramer, president of the New York money
management firm Cramer &amp; Co. ``Whenever the big sell programs come
in I think the powers that be ought to be in there taking it back
up.''

   Workers on Wall Street are earning more money
than ever _ if they're still working.
   A federal report Tuesday said 15,000 securities industry
employees here have lost their jobs since the stock market crash of
October 1987. For those who survived, however, average pay was
nearly $79,000 last year.
   That was a 13 percent salary increase over 1987, and it came to
more than 2.5 times the average annual pay for all private
employees in New York City.
   The report, by the regional Bureau of Labor Statistics, said New
York's economy was not devastated by the 1987 crash, as some
feared. But employment has been essentially flat since the crash,
after a decade of growth.
   ``The post-crash record has clearly not been the disaster widely
touted by the forecasts and in the headlines in the early months
following Black Monday,'' the report said. ``But it does close out
a period of unprecedented private sector job expansion, marking a
distinct break with the past.''
   Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of labor statistics,
said the stock market's more recent gyrations were part of an
ongoing restructuring in the securities industry.
   ``The stock market crash two years ago marked the end of the
resurgence of the '80s and the beginning of a transition that's
still taking shape,'' said Ehrenhalt. ``What you're seeing now is a
continuation of structural changes on Wall Street. That process
hasn't reached its end point.''
   At the same time, Wall Street's rising salaries indicated ``a
good deal of vitality,'' Ehrenhalt said. Average annual pay in the
securities industry in the city has risen from $19,317 in 1975 to
$78,625 last year.
   The figures indicated that securities workers laid off since the
crash were the least productive and lowest paid, Ehrenhalt said.
   The securities industry in New York now employs 146,000 people,
down from a peak of 163,000 in December 1987. Hiring momentum
carried it to its peak two months after the crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Before the crash, Wall Street employment had increased by an
average of 12,000 jobs a year since the early 1980s.
   The banking industry also lost jobs as a result of the 1987
market crash, with employment falling by 9,500 in the past two
years, the agency said. Banking jobs had been declining before the
crash, but far more slowly.

<HEAD>Exchange Heads Warn About Reforms' Effects on Competitiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of the nation's four largest
futures exchanges told a Senate committee that some proposed market
reforms could drive their business overseas.
   At the same hearing Tuesday, the head of the agency that
oversees the futures markets said the proposed legislation gives
the markets more power than they want.
   Wendy L. Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, said her agency neither needs nor wants authority to
conduct undercover operations like the one that resulted in 46
indictments this summer in Chicago's freewheeling commodities
trading pits.
   ``I believe the current situation with the FBI having the
authority is sufficient,'' Ms. Gramm told the Senate Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which is considering legislation
to reform the futures markets and reauthorize financing for the
CFTC, which oversees them.
   Ms. Gramm also said:
   _She believed that 17 of the indicted Chicago traders still were
working in the pits, including some handling customer orders. She
expressed concern about it but said the regulatory agency had to
balance that against the rights of the accused. ``They're indicted.
They haven't been tried and convicted.''
   _Temporary trading halts, known as ``circuit breakers,'' and
other market safeguards implemented since the 1987 stock market
crash ``appeared to work as designed'' during Friday's stock market
plunge. She also said she was satisfied with inter-market
communication during the stock slide.
   _There was no need to give the CFTC power to order crooked
brokers to pay restitution to customers they have cheated. ``A
majority of the commission believes current law provides sufficient
recourse for customers to obtain reimbursement of losses when funds
are available,'' she said.
   At the same hearing, officials of the Chicago Board of Trade,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the New York-based Commodity Exchange warned senators that
tougher record-keeping standards and service fees mandated by the
bill could make them uncompetitive with foreign markets.
   In addition to undercover probes and broker restitution, the
proposed Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 would require
stricter record-keeping by market participants to ``independently,
precisely and completely'' record transaction times.
   At issue is the ``audit trail,'' an accurate record of any given
transaction that would allow investigators to determine if it
reflected what really happened and if the transaction followed the
rules.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigatory arm of the
Congress, has found that current record-keeping on most exchanges
is inadequate to prevent fraud because so much of it is orginated
by traders themselves _ often by hand.
   The bill also calls for financing stepped-up floor surveillance
through service fees, which several exchanges have criticized as a
secret tax.
   ``The worst outcome of this reauthorization process,'' said BOT
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann, would be to use the Chicago indictments
as an excuse ``for imposing audit trail standards utterly
incompatible with a liquid market or raising costs of access to our
customers by imposing new and unwarranted taxes on our markets.''
   He added that new fees ``could constitute a crushing burden and
competitive handicap'' against foreign markets that aren't as
restricted.
   The bill is sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
committee chairman, and Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the
panel's ranking Republican.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future. They are used
by producers of such commodities as soybeans or gold to lock in a
favorable price, while speculators buy and sell those contracts in
pursuit of a profit.
   ``During this past year,'' said Leahy, ``regulation of the
futures industry has lurched from crisis to crisis.''
   In addition to the undercover FBI probe that resulted in the
Chicago indictments, a separate probe of futures exchanges in New
York was disclosed in May.
   In July, the CBOT issued an emergency order requiring traders to
slash their holdings in soybeans futures contracts. The order
touched off wild fluctuations in soybean prices.
   A bill also containing futures market reform was passed by the
House last month. Both bills seek to limit dual trading, the
controversial _ but legal _ practice that allows traders to conduct
transactions for their own accounts as well as those of their
customers.
   Ms. Gramm said a study by her agency found dual trading does not
have the impact on futures markets that its supporters have claimed.

   The International Air Transport Association
has announced an agreement for a computer-based system officials
said should increase airline profits and help passengers fly where
they want with less difficulty.
   The system to manage airline seat inventories is already used by
several U.S. airlines.
   IATA, which represents the world's scheduled airlines, will make
it available for a fee to both large and small carriers throughout
the world, officials said Tuesday.
   By keeping track of seat use and passenger demand, the system
developed by Control Data Corp. of Minneapolis allows airlines to
make the best use of available seats, both in terms of revenue and
service, said Gary E. Campbell of Control Data.
   He said the system enables a large or small airline to project
how many seats it can sell in various categories for each flight
and could help the company in making decisions about advertising
and the number and size of planes to use on its routes.
   For passengers, it will mean less of a chance of getting bumped
off of a flight and a better chance of getting a ticket for the
flight desired, Campbell said.
   The price an airline pays for the service will be determined by
the number of passengers it carries, and the system can be applied
either to selected flights or to all of the flights the airline
operates, said Geoffrey Bailey, who will manage the system for IATA
in Geneva.
   Information, including seats available for each flight, would be
constantly updated by the airlines that participate and made
available to travel agents throughout the world, he said.
   ``What this could lead to is a situation where you could go into
a travel agent and say, `I've got $50 and I want to fly from
Washington to Miami. What can you do for me?''' said Bailey. While
such a flight may not be immediately available, he said, the agent
might be able to find an airline willing to take the passenger.
   Bailey said such systems have increased an airline's overall
revenue by from 5 percent to 11 percent by reducing the number of
unused seats and helping it to set realistic fares for business and
personal travel.
   The price IATA paid for the license to lease the system to its
member airlines was not disclosed.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Sees No Massive Trade Deficit Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
that new economic talks with Japan should produce a plan for
action, but no massive cut by next year in the U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
   The two countries have agreed to make a final report next July
on their talks to remove ``structural impediment'' barriers to
trade between the United States and Japan.
   The talks began in Tokyo last month and are to continue, off and
on, until next summer.
   Even by then, Mrs. Hills cautioned Tuesday, ``it will be very
hard to say'' that the negotiators have achieved ``a massive
reduction in the deficit.''
   Mrs. Hills was asked at a news conference how she would cope
with growing sentiment in Congress for negotiated market shares, or
managed trade, if there is no easing of the U.S. deficit with
Japan. That hortfall has been running at more than $50 billion a
year.
   ``I am against managed trade,'' she said. ``I think you sell
yourself short when you decree that a group of bureaucrats can
decide you are entitled to 5 or 10 per cent of a market. In almost
every market where we agreed to a percentage, ... I feel
shortchanged. I think we could do better,'' she added.
   Echoing President Bush's declaration that the talks would be ``a
two-way street,'' the Japanese are pressing the United States to
improve its education and competitiveness and raise savings
deposits and investment.
   In Tokyo, she said, the Japanese side ``was impressed'' with
facts and figures produced by the United States to bolster
complaints against traditional Japanese systems of distribution,
pricing, land use, business collusion and bidding, all of which the
United States says discriminate against foreign products.
   ``It is a win-win situation,'' not a question of dictating to
each other, she said, because there is little dispute about the
potential gains of eliminating the shortcomings that have been
identified in each country.
   Early action on the Japanese side, she said, could take the form
of tightening enforcement of laws already on the books. At the
current enforcement level, there is little incentive not to engage
in business collusion, she said, and the Japanese Fair Trade
Commission needs more funds.
   The commission last fined a business in the 1970s and took no
action at all last year, she said, in contrast to the U.S. Justice
Department, which in 1988 filed 200 criminal actions and fined U.S.
businesses $30 million.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company virtually unknown in North America may
hold the remedy to the Soviet Union's severe housing shortage by
literally building from the ground up.
   Terra Block Worldwide, which was dirt-poor five years ago, has
hit the motherlode in the Soviet Union with its simple hydraulic
compressor that converts regular soil into sturdy adobe-like
construction bricks.
   The Orlando-based company received Soviet orders for 2,000 of
its $75,000 Terrablock Duplex Machines following a visit to Moscow
earlier this year by company founder Robert Gross.
   ``We're getting inquiries from the Soviet Union nearly every
day,'' said Gross, a retired National Aeronautics and Space
Administration engineer. ``We can't make the machines quickly
enough.''
   Gross said Terra Block now must divert nearly all its focus
toward the Soviet Union, where the era of perestroika has eased
trade restrictions with the West.
   ``The Soviets face an incredible housing crunch. Sometimes there
are three families sharing a flat no bigger than a studio
apartment,'' said Gross, 57, who spends nearly half the year
traveling abroad. ``This is something that Gorbachev has set as a
priority. We just happened to be the right company at the right
place at the right political time.''
   Gross said the machine was inspired by a trip to Arizona in the
1970s, when he studied homes constructed of hand-made adobe.
Properly built adobe structures offer a natural insulation and are
extremely durable, such as the 900-year-old Taos Pueblo in New
Mexico.
   But the weeks needed to dry the adobe bricks in the sun made
large-scale modern projects impractical.
   Gross then began work on a prototype compression machine that
used computerized hydraulic rams to squeeze dirt into building
blocks. The production-model Terrablock Duplex churns out up to 600
30-pound blocks an hour using less than a gallon of diesel fuel.
   The bricks, formed under nearly 500,000 pounds-per-square-inch
pressure, are stacked without mortar and covered with a
plaster-based coating. The structures have passed all international
seismic and stress tests, said Gross.
   Terra Block spokesman Steve Buntell said the bricks can be used
for buildings up to two stories high.
   Several other brick-making machines are in use in the Third
World, but Buntell said they require additives such as concrete and
operate more slowly.
   In 1985, the company sold just one machine, to the west African
nation of Gabon. Today there are about 50 machines in use, mostly
in Africa and Asia. Four machines have been sold in the United
States, including one to the Hare Krishna sect for its proposed
headquarters in Tennessee.
   ``We haven't found any soil yet that won't work,'' said Gross,
nicknamed ``Dr. Dirt'' by co-workers. ``The sandier the soil, the
more pressure needed. But we've made blocks from soil in Saudi
Arabia that was almost all sand. Even in winter we can dig below
the frozen surface to useable dirt.''
   The $150 million Terrablock deal with the Soviet Union offers an
insight into the nation's changing economic policies, he said.
While the state-run construction ministry acts as a liaison,
individual community-based cooperatives can put in orders for a
machine if they come up with hard currency, such as dollars.
   When an order is placed, the money is transferred directly into
Terra Block's account in an Amsterdam-based bank, said Gross.
   Carl McMillian, a Soviet trade expert at Carlton University in
Ottawa, said the Soviet government is becoming more aggressive in
seeking needed goods, including housing.
   ``If they want it bad enough then there's a way to come up with
the hard cash,'' he said.
   Last year, the Soviets imported $26.4 billion worth of Western
goods and exported $22.9 billion in goods to the West, said
McMillian.
   Terra Block's plans call for about 100 machines to be shipped to
the Soviet Union by the end of the year.
   ``The deal with the Soviets was a breakthrough for us,'' said
Buntell. ``It really gave a push to the dream of becoming the
world's largest home builder.''

<HEAD>Eastern Officials Say Airline Rebuilding Faster Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines says it is
rebuilding faster than it had projected last spring and should
emerge larger than expected from bankruptcy reorganization, but two
of its unions questioned the carrier's long-term stability.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., and
Phil Bakes, Eastern's president, said a combination of lower labor
costs and a level of public acceptance that is enabling the airline
to fill ``a very healthy percentage '' of its seats have helped the
airline rebuild.
   ``We are well along on our road of rebuilding the airline,''
Lorenzo told a news conference Tuesday.
   Lorenzo also said the company was continuing to discuss an
amended plan of reorganization with its creditors and expected to
file it shortly. He said he remained committed to paying creditors
``100 cents on the dollar.''
   But spokesmen for two of the unions that have been on strike
against the Miami-based airline since March 4 said Eastern
continues to face serious competitive problems.
   Eastern filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws shortly after being hit by the strike
by its Machinists union, pilots and flight attendants.
   The company said it would have 85 percent to 90 percent of
pre-strike operations when it emerges from bankruptcy protection
early next year. Its earlier target was to emerge at 60 percent to
65 percent of pre-strike operations.
   The airline expects to surpass its earlier goal of having about
820 daily flights in December, and should have 1,000 flights a day
by late spring, compared with 1,050 before the strike.
   Those figures exclude its Northeast shuttle service that Eastern
sold to developer Donald Trump for $365 million earlier this year.
   But Wally Haber, senior general chairman District 100
Machinists, which represents all Eastern Machinists members, said
he had doubts about whether Eastern will be able to meet its new
goals for flights.
   ``We know they are extremely short of aircraft mechanics,'' he
said. ``We just don't think they can get the Machinists to support
the type of flight levels they are talking about.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association, meanwhile, said that although
Eastern presnted itself ``all gussied up in new clothes and fresh
makeup'' at the news conference, the airline ``still is facing a
doubtful future as a survivor in the highly competitive airline
market.''
   Among Eastern's continuing problems, the pilots group said, are
financial shortfalls, chronic shortages and other problems in
maintenance and pilot training, vulnerability to an economic
downturn and an aging fleet.
   Bakes declined to comment on how much money Eastern was losing
but said he expects the airline to be profitable in 1990.
   Bakes said Eastern will operate a fleet of 188 planes next
spring, compared with the 157 it projected initially.
   The company also said it had a work force of 17,300, compared
with 31,200 before the strike. Eastern has hired replacement pilots
and some have crossed picket lines.
   Eastern expects to surpass its projection of 750 daily flights
by November and fly 775 to 80 cities. It expects to fly 835 daily
flights in December, up from an earlier projection of 820.
   Eastern now is flying about 700 flights a day.
   Eastern said it intends to maintain a strong international
presence, providing service to South and Central America, Mexico
and the Caribbean.
   Atlanta has been restored as Eastern's major hub, the company
said, and Eastern should again be Miami's largest carrier this
winter.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls In Europe, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in early European trading today,
pushed lower by news of the San Francisco earthquake and the
higher-than-expected U.S. trade deficit, dealers said.
   Gold rose in moderate trading, boosted by the weaker dollar and
higher oil prices which dealers said were lifted by concern that
the earthquake could affect the U.S. West Coast oil industry.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they expected the earthquake to
have little further impact on the dollar beyond its minor early
drop.
   Traders said the market was waiting for further developments on
the New York Stock Exchange following Tuesday's news that the U.S.
trade deficit in August was $10.8 billion, about $1.7 billion worse
than expected, and will closely follow the movement of the Dow
Jones stock index.
   ``The dollar is hanging on the Dow Jones,'' said Jens-Uwe
Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover bank in Frankfurt.
``As long as the Dow remains steady, I think we'll see a slightly
firmer dollar.''
   Other traders expected the dollar's near-term movement to be
lower, but agreed that its fate was largely tied to the New York
market.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.15 yen to a closing 142.10 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 141.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8520;
1.6215 Swiss francs, down from 1.6227; 6.2810 French francs, down
from 6.2960; 2.0970 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0867; 1,361.50
Italian lire, down from 1,365.00; 1.1725 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1755.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5905 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5835 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368 a troy ounce, up
from late Tuesday's $367.75. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368, up from $367.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.72 to close at a bid $368.38.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.12 a troy
ounce, unuchanged from late Tuesday.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index gained
moderately in calm trading today, nearly regaining its level before
the Wall Street plunge, while the dollar inched down against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.15 yen from Tuesday's
142.25-yen close. It opened at 142.55 yen and ranged between 142.05
yen and 142.63 yen.
   The dollar had gained 1.50 yen Tuesday after its 3.25-yen plunge
the previous day.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 111.48 points, or 0.32
percent, to 35,107.56. On Tuesday, it had gained 527.39 points, the
second-largest one-day gain this year after a 793.96 point advance
on March 28.
   Together, the gains of Tuesday and today nearly erased Monday's
647.33-point loss _ this year's largest one-day decline _ which
followed a big tumble on Wall Street on Friday.
   ``The market was calm and strong as players were reassured by
stability in foreign exchange rates despite America's worsened
trade deficit,'' said Masayoshi Yano, a Nikko Securities dealer.
   The deficit, reported by the U.S. Commerce Department on
Tuesday, rose to $10.77 billion in August, up from a revised $8.24
billion in July.
   Cautious investors stayed away from issues sensitive to interest
and foreign currency rates, Yano said.
   He said Japanese stock trading was not affected by news of a
severe earthquake, with heavy casualties, in the San Francisco area.
   ``If the New York market falls in reaction to the earthquake, it
may have some effects in Tokyo tomorrow,'' Yano added.
   Trading was fairly active, with first section volume estimated
at 800 million shares, up from Tuesday's 650 million.
   Currency dealings were calm and ``boring,'' said Mitsuhiko
Kinugasa, a senior trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``Many participants were curious why the dollar remained so
strong above the 142-yen level even after the report of a large
(U.S.) trade deficit, but the basic trend here is to maintain the
dollar's stability,'' he said.
   Considering such factors as the trade deficit and Friday's stock
plunge, however, the dollar will turn downward sooner or later, he
said.

   Stock prices cast aside recent gloom to post solid
gains today.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was 17.9 points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,153.4 points.
   Volume was a healthy 239.9 million shares compared with 360.2
million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   Insurance stocks, which some equity analysts forecast might be
heavily hit by the earthquake disaster in San Francisco, were
showing only narrow losses.
   Buyers were tempted to return by an upward trend in the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index futures contract,
dealers said.
   In late morning, the contract was trading at a 12-point premium
to the underlying market, against a recent trend to trade at a
discount.
   Despite the swing into positive territory, dealers said the
market remained edgy in case Wall Street opened weakly.
   ``If so, London will be dragged lower,'' one dealer said.
   Dealers said the market remained nervous because it could be
swung so violently by shifts in sentiment. ``The market could crack
at any moment,'' said one London dealer. ``There isn't enough
institutional interest to help the market steady.''

   Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis has withdrawn
his backup $300-a-share, all-cash bid for United Airlines' parent
but indicated he might make another offer.
   ``We remain very interested in acquiring UAL Corp.,'' Davis said
in a statement late Tuesday.
   A proposed $300-a-share offer by a pilot-management group, along
with British Airways PLC, fell short Friday when banks refused to
finance the deal. News of the financing problems helped trigger the
largest drop in the Dow Jones industrials average since the crash
of 1987, but the group and its lenders are attempting to work out a
revised proposal.
   At the time, Davis said his offer would apply if the
pilot-management deal fell through. It was Davis who had triggered
the UAL buyout battle when he first submitted a bid for the company
in August.
   But Davis said that when the bank financing fell through for the
pilot-management group, his agent bank informed him that it was
exploring the level of financing available for his proposed
acquisition of UAL.
   Davis said he intended to continue working with his financing
sources ``in order to determine at what price a bid can be
financed.''
   On Tuesday, UAL stock plunged as investors continued to express
skepticism over efforts by the pilot-management group to put
together a new buyout proposal. Shares fell $24.87{ to close at
$198 in New York Stock Exchange trading, after plummeting nearly
$57 a share on Monday.
   ``There's still a significant group on Wall Street that simply
does not believe a deal is going to get done for UAL,'' said
Stephen Dexter, an airline industry analyst with Kemper Financial
Services Inc.
   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank were working to line up
Japanese lenders to finance the deal.
   Terms of the revised UAL proposal would lower the bid to $250 a
share or $5.62 billion, raise the interest rate on the loan and
give banks bigger fees for participating, said Akira Yokoo, a
Citicorp spokesman in Tokyo.
   The Evening Standard in London reported that Dai-ichi Kangyo
Bank had agreed to participate in the deal, partly because the
Japanese government wanted to boost the country's reputation as an
aggressive lender.
   At Mitsubishi Trust Bank in Tokyo, a spokesman said the bank
would ``probably'' finance part of the deal.
   Meanwhile, John Peterpaul, the vice president of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
reiterated the union's vehement opposition to the takeover and
called for the resignation of UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
   ``Your role in the recent effort to take over United Airlines
... can only be characterized as greedy and irresponsible,''
Peterpaul said in a letter to Wolf.
   Wolf would have reaped $76.7 million and chief financial officer
John C. Pope, $37.7 million under the original buyout proposal.
   Wolf said any resignations were not in the best interest of the
company. He defended his actions and those of the board of
directors, saying it was ``regrettable'' and ``totally unfair''
that the Machinists have ``chosen to make such a divisive and
uncalled-for statement.''
   Kemper analyst Dexter said the demand for Wolf's resignation
reinforces bankers' concerns that without the support of the
Machinists, the nation's second-largest air carrier is likely to be
more financially unstable after a buyout.
   ``The Machinists are trying to get a 5 percent raise and the
president is reaping $70 million,'' he said. ``You can understand
why they're hostile.''

   The stock market, still reeling from the
aftershock of several wild days on Wall Street, could suffer
another jolt today as investors worry about the impact California's
catastrophic earthquake could have on insurance, technology and
other companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 11.68 to
2,627.05 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the New York
Stock Exchange by about 11 to 5, with 706 down, 312 up and 463
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 24.33 million
shares by 10 a.m. EDT.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.44 to 188.45.
   The deadly earthquake in the San Francisco area raised concerns
about the extent of insurance companies' liabilities, which could
weigh down those stocks. Technology companies with operations in
California also could encounter some selling.
   Meanwhile, new evidence of weakening economic activity raised
speculation that a significant slowdown might be a serious drag on
corporate profits.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department said housing
construction fell 5.2 percent in September to the lowest level
since the 1982 recession.
   In the early going, UAL extended its skid, falling 7] to 190|.
The selling apparently was in reaction to word that Los Angeles
financier Marvin Davis has withdrawn his backup $300-a-share,
all-cash bid for United Airlines' parent.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph led the Big Board's list of
actively traded shares, falling [ to 42[.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.65 to
2,638.73, erasing a portion of Monday's 88-point rebound from
Friday's megadrop.
   Losers outpaced gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of
NYS-listed issues, with 931 down, 658 up and 413 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index declined 0.87 to 188.89.

   A dashing banker with a taste for Alfa Romeos.
Rumored military shipments to the Middle East. A secret plan to
provide billions of dollars to Iraq through Italy's biggest bank _
with no record on the books.
   It could be the stuff of a Robert Ludlum potboiler. But since
U.S. authorities descended on an Italian bank in Atlanta last
August, the elements have instead emerged at the center of a
mystery involving Italy, Iraq and a U.S. government agency.
   Officials say the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro branch in Atlanta's
Peachtree Center secretly approved $3 billion in loans to Iraq in
1988-89, in the form of letters of credit for U.S. and European
firms for exports to Iraq.
   Iraq insists it was unaware the loans were secret. It says the
money was for grain and machinery and other civilian uses, like
making cars.
   But several companies that reportedly received secret BNL
credits were implicated in past Middle East arms scandals. Other
firms used BNL credits to sell Iraq machines with possible military
applications, although they say the sales were legal.
   The case has become Italy's biggest banking scandal since the
1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank,
which made huge loans to Latin American dummy companies.
   It has prompted an investigation by Rome magistrates into
possible illegal arms sales and bribes, and probes by the FBI and
U.S. attorney in Atlanta into whether fraud was involved. So far,
no one has been charged.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture also is investigating whether
its Commodity Credit Corporation was duped in the affair.
   Meanwhile, directors of the government-owned BNL have been
forced to resign and Italian opposition parties have demanded an
inquiry.
   ``We want credible answers from the government to the questions
of traffic of arms, the role of the secret service, the violation
of international embargoes regarding Iraq,'' declared a leftist
opposition deputy, Franco Bassanini.
   ``In this case there are disquieting signs and suspicions.''
   So far, the affair has raised many puzzling questions. Why were
the huge loans to Iraq made? How could they slip unnoticed past
U.S. and Italian regulators? Who in the bank or the various
governments knew what was going on?
   At the center of the scandal is the Atlanta branch manager,
40-year-old Christopher Drogoul. A blond, athletically built
French-American with a penchant for well-cut suits and Alfa Romeo
sports cars, Drogoul was considered an intelligent, aggressive
banker.
   BNL says Drogoul was supposed to stick to a credit limit of
$500,000 per customer and it thought he did.
   But Drogoul manipulated the books and hid the Iraqi credits in
secret files, some in his red-brick home in suburban Decatur, U.S.
and Italian authorities say.
   The banker and his lawyer have refused comment.
   BNL has fired the former manager and suspended nine other
managers of the 19-member Atlanta staff. On Oct. 12, the bank sued
in U.S. federal court charging Drogoul and Paul Von Wedel, a
suspended vice president of the Atlanta office, with providing
unauthorized credits that cost the bank millions of dollars in
losses. Their lawyer denied the bank was harmed.
   Guido Carli, minister of Italy's Treasury, which owns 74 percent
of BNL, has charged the bank's directors missed the Atlanta
arrangements through lax inspection.
   But many people doubt that the $3 billion operation could have
escaped the notice of the home office.
   ``It's too odd,'' said a European banker in London, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Commissions were coming in. Why? The bank
(branch) hadn't been inspected for such a long time. Why?''
   BNL's former U.S. director, Luigi Sardelli, told the Italian
weekly Europeo that when he was appointed in 1987, the BNL branches
hadn't been inspected in two years.
   He alerted the bank's directors of serious problems in Atlanta;
the warning was ignored, Sardelli said.
   Suspicions of connivance by top bank officials have led to
speculation that Italian politicians were involved _ a natural leap
of faith in a country in which 80 percent of the banks are
government-owned and most bank directors are political appointees.
   Former BNL executives have fed the fire by implying
international skulduggery.
   ``There's something that escapes us; something that has to do
with international politics, not of a banking nature,'' the bank's
ousted chairman, Nerio Nesi, told the Italian weekly L'Espresso.
   Aside from escaping detection at bank headquarters, the Atlanta
operation also passed unnoticed during inspections by the Georgia
Banking and Finance Department and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which
did not realize BNL was financing the Iraqi credits through loans
from other banks. In Italy, the central Bank of Italy picked up no
trace of the secret loans.
   ``There were two sets of books. The set we had looked fine,''
said Bob Moler, a spokesman for the Georgia department, which had
primary responsibility for regulating the bank.
   Like the Banco Ambrosiano case, the BNL affair underlines bank
regulators' difficulties in controlling transactions in an
increasingly international market. The problem worries Italian
officials who, among other things, fear the Mafia will easily
launder its money when the 12-nation European Community becomes a
unified market in 1992.
   Unlike Banco Ambrosiano, BNL will not collapse, authorities
emphasize. State companies have issued loans to increase the bank's
capital, and the Bank of Italy would intervene if BNL ran into
trouble.
   Iraq has promised to make good on the credits, although analysts
have raised fears about payment because Iraq's economy was crippled
by its war with Iran.
   BNL isn't the only institution that could get stuck if Iraq
doesn't repay. The U.S. Commodity Credit Corporation, which
promotes American farm exports, has guaranteed about $700 million
of the BNL credits granted in 1988-89.
   ``Sure, we're concerned about what we have learned has happened
in the bank in Atlanta,'' said Don Street of the agency's
operations division. ``But that has not changed our looking at
Iraq's ability to pay back.''
   Nonetheless, the Department of Agriculture is examining all its
BNL operations.

   Stocks turned higher, reversing course after a
brief, initial selloff today, as trading activity slowed from a
recently brisk pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, down about 12
points in the first 30 minutes of trading, posted a gain of 3.69 at
2,642.42 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues had overtaken declining ones on the New York

545 were unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 60.49 million
shares after ninety minutes of trading.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.54 to 189.43.
   Activity on Wall Street seemed more subdued compared with the
volatile trading that prevailed for the past three sessions,
starting with Friday when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
190 points.
   Despite worries about the negative impact California's
catastrophic earthquake might have on some companies, insurance and
technology stocks were holding up well.
   Travelers rose \ to 40[ and there were scattered gains for other
insurers.
   Among some heavily trading over-the-counter technology stocks,
Apple added { to 47} and Microsoft rose 1] to 80.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric fell ] to 19|.
   The turbulence in the stock market lately had been intensified
by confusion surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL. A tumble in
shares of the parent of United Airlines helped trigger Friday's
megadrop.
   The slide in UAL slowed as the stock lost 3 to 195. The selling
apparently was in reaction to word that Los Angeles financier

<HEAD>Grain Futures Open Mixed; Soviet Soybean Talk Persists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with the
main support stemming from persistent rumors that the Soviet Union
is shopping for soybeans.
   Talk of Soviet interest in U.S. soybeans and soybean meal helped
lift soybean and soybean meal futures sharply on Tuesday.
   Corn futures opened slightly higher but quickly turned mixed.
   Wheat futures were slightly lower in a follow-through from
yesterday's modest decline. An Agriculture Department announcement
that Egypt had bought 225,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices was initially perceived as bullish but traders
later said the amount was less than expected.
   Forecasts for more harvest-hampering rain today and tomorrow in
the Midwest were seen as slightly bullish for the corn and soybean
markets, although clearing skies and warmer conditions are expected
by the weekend.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for December delivery at $4.08 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.38}
a bushel; oats were { cent higher across the board with December at

at $5.57 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

   All livestock and meat futures settled higher on Tuesday with

<HEAD>Jaguar Hopes To Announce GM Deal Within A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC said
Wednesday it hopes to announce within a month an agreement with
General Motors Corp. under which the U.S. automaker would buy a
minority stake in Jaguar.
   Jaguar has negotiated with GM for several weeks over a possible
cooperation agreement that might thwart a potential buyout bid for
the British firm by Ford Motor Co.
   ``Providing the discussions continue to go well and are
successful, I would be disappointed if we could not be in the
position to put something to our shareholders in the next month,''
Jaguar Chairman John Egan said.
   Jaguar has said it is not interested in being taken over by Ford
or any other car maker, and would prefer a cooperation agreement
with another company.
   Egan, who made his remarks to reporters at a British motor
industry show, said he has not received an approach from Ford since
mid-September, when Ford announced its intention to take a 15
percent stake as a possible prelude to a full bid.
   On Tuesday, Ford said it raised its Jaguar stake to 10.4 percent
from 5 percent.

   Dow Chemical Co. said Wednesday that third-quarter earnings fell
7 percent on lower demand for polyethylene, while Monsanto Co. said
its profits rose 9 percent with strong showings by its chemical and
Nutrasweet divisions.
   Dow, based in Midland, Mich., reported net income of $589
million, or $3.29 a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30,
down from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, in the 1988 third quarter.
   Sales for the period reached $4.25 billion, up 2 percent from
$4.15 billion a year earlier, the company said.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Dow reported net income of
$2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, on sales of $13.34 billion, up
from $1.76 billion, or $9.38 a share, on sales of $12.38 billion in
the same period last year.
   Demand for polyethylene used in items from plastic wrap to milk
jugs was short and prices were higher in the quarter so prices
fell, Dow spokeswoman Sarah Opperman said.
   Dow's third-quarter revenue from plastics fell 4 percent, while
revenue from chemicals grew 5 percent and consumer specialties such
as Seldane antihistamine grew more than 11 percent, the company
said.
   St. Louis-based Monsanto, a diversified company that also owns
Searle pharmaceuticals, reported net income of $126 million, or
$1.88 per share, on sales of $2.06 billion. That compared with
earnings of $116 million, or $1.67 a share, on sales of $2.02
billion for the same 1988 period.
   Monsanto's chemicals division reported operating income of $117
million, up from $96 million in the 1988 third quarter. NutraSweet
showed operating income of $39 million, up from $27 million a year
ago.
   Monsanto's crop chemicals and animals sciences agricultural
divisions reported operating income of $57 million, down from $78
million in the 1988 quarter. The drop was attributed to drought
conditions in Europe and the western United States.
   For the first three quarters of 1989, Monsanto reported earnings
of $589 million, or $8.66 per share, on sales of $6.67 billion.
That compared with earnings of $546 million, or $7.57 per share, on
sales of $6.41 billion in the first nine months of 1988.

<HEAD>Cluett Deal Viewed as Step Toward Completing Farley-Pepperell Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textile industry analysts were trying to
determine whether the proposed $600 million sale of three Cluett,
Peabody &amp; Co. manufacturing divisions to a French company would
significantly cut debt from Farley Inc.'s acquisition of West
Point-Pepperell Inc.
   Cluett, the makers of Arrow shirts, Gold Toe socks and
Schoeneman suits, is a division of Georgia-based Pepperell, which
was acquired by Chicago-based Farley in a $3 billion debt-financed
deal earlier this year.
   Bidermann Industries USA, a subsidiary of the Paris-based
Bidermann Group, a fashion and apparel firm, is acquiring the major
Cluett manufacturing divisions under an agreement announced Monday.
   Farley has for months been expected to sell Cluett to pare the
debt from the Pepperell deal. Farley reportedly sought up to $800
million for the Cluett divisions, although some analysts have
placed their value as low as $450 million.
   ``He (Farley) almost certainly got less than he wanted,'' said
Don Hogsett, business editor of Home Textiles Today, a trade
publication. ``The question remains how does he pare down his debt.
Will he have to sell more?''
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine was traveling Tuesday and could
not be reached for comment. Messages left through his secretary in
Chicago were not returned.
   Roy Bowen, executive vice president of the Georgia Textile
Manufacturing Association, said it was difficult to predict what
Farley might do next to secure cash for the Pepperell deal.
   ``A lot has happened in the debt markets since he acquired West
Point,'' he said.
   Bowen said the Bidermann deal should not have much effect on
Pepperell's operations because Cluett is in the apparel sector
rather than in Pepperell's main textile business.
   ``This doesn't detract at all from West Point's standing as a
major textile company,'' he said.
   Applauding the deal was the Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Textile
Workers Union, which itself made a bid for Cluett during the summer.
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Garry Ferraris, an ACTWU vice
president in Knoxville, Tenn. ``It (Bidermann) looks like a company
that's on a solid financial slate and putting up enough cash so it
won't be so leveraged.''
   The sale to Bidermann, subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to be completed by the end of November.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with major U.S. oil companies reporting
Northern California slowdowns from quake. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. said today that the devastating Northern
California earthquake forced it to shut two major oil pipelines
that distribute gasoline, jet oil and other products throughout the
area.
   Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc., meanwhile, reported minor problems,
including power outages, but said their facilities were continuing
to operate at near normal capacity.
   Chevron spokesman Hal Holt said the hundreds of miles of
pipeline flowing from its Richmond, Calif., refinery northeast of
San Francisco to various distribution terminals in and around the
Bay area were closed as a precautionary measure and would reopen
after inspection.
   He said no shortages were expected and the Santa Fe and Bay Area
pipelines could resume normal operations later in the day.
   ``They will be visually inspected. There are no reports of
leakage along those lines,'' Holt said today from Chevron's East
Bay offices in Richmond.
   The quake was not affecting oil futures prices in early New York
Mercantile Exchange activity, traders said. Just before midday, the
November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude, was trading at $20.74 a barrel, down 1 cent from
Tuesday.
   Gasoline for November delivery was down 0.19 cent to 55.84 cents
a gallon to 55.84 cents a gallon and domestic heating oil was down
0.50 cent at 61.05 cents a gallon.
   Holt said the quake also jolted Chevron's 315,000 barrel-a-day
refinery but the plant returned to normal operations early today
after some equipment automatically shut down due to vibrations. He
said the refinery, which makes gasoline, jet oil, heating oil and
other products, has been producing about 280,000 barrels a day.
   Power outages also have closed Chevron's loading racks, keeping
trucks from filling their tanks for distribution. Holt also said
power outages were preventing some service stations from pumping
gasoline.
   The quake shook Exxon's 132,000 barrel-a-day Benicia, Calif.,
refinery but that the facility had cut back production only
slightly ``just as a cushion to see if there will be any
aftershocks,'' said Henry Beathard, Exxon spokesman in Houston. The
refinery is located about 40 miles east of San Francisco.
   Texaco's refinery in Richmond, Calif., received minor damage but
was continuing to operate, said company spokeswoman Sharon Stakes.
   ``We will be able to continue distribution if roads are
accessible,'' Stakes said.
   In London markets, open-market prices of North Sea Brent Blend
crude oil were slightly higher at midday Wednesday on speculation
that the earthquake might disrupt supplies of crude oil and
petroleum products in California.
   Brent Blend prices were 15 cents to 20 cents a barrel above
their levels late Tuesday in Europe, and above their levels earlier
today in Tokyo.
   London-based officials of U.S. companies which operate
facilities in San Francisco said they were unable to obtain
information about possible damage because telephone lines to the
area were jammed.
   At about midday London time, Brent Blend for delivery in
November stood at $19.80 a barrel, up 20 cents from late Tuesday.
Brent Blend for December delivery was up 15 cents at $19.10.

<HEAD>Cable Firm TCI to Buy Half of Showtime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc.
has announced it will buy 50 percent of Showtime Networks Inc., the
nation's second-largest pay television service.
   Tele-Communications said Tuesday it plans to buy half of
Showtime from New York-based Viacom International Inc. for $225
million.
   Other investors may participate in the purchase, the company
added.
   Showtime has been struggling to compete against the larger Home
Box Office, owned by Time Warner Inc., and Viacom has been looking
for possible investors from the cable industry to invest in
Showtime.
   Analysts said the infusion of cash, along with
Tele-Communications' strength in the industry, will help Showtime.
   ``I think this is terrific,'' said Showtime's chairman and chief
executive, Winston H. ``Tony'' Cox.
   ``Having the support of a leading cable company like TCI means
some rather significant subscriber growth. Secondly, the rest of
the industry will recognize the TCI endorsement, which will help us
with other cable operators,'' he said.
   Home Box Office operates the HBO and Cinemax pay-TV networks
that claim about 23 million million subscribers. Showtime operates
Showtime and The Movie Channel, which have a combined total of
about 10 million subscribers.
   Viacom said Showtime Networks has been marginally profitable but
it doesn't break out is earnings.
   Tele-Communications president John Malone said in a statement
that pay television is an important part of the company's
operations.
   Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable company, has
been investing in programming channels in recent years. It led a
bailout of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcast Systems Inc. and owns
chunks of such channels as American Movie Classics and Black
Entertainment Network.
   Showtime runs on most of Tele-Communications' cable systems. The
company also carries Home Box Office on most of its systems.
   Stewart Schley, editor of the Cable World trade journal in
Denver, said the purchase ``offers a lot of distribution strengths
for Showtime. I think, strategically, it increases the likelihood
of a strong No. 2 for Showtime.''
   ``Without TCI, our future would be a lot less secure,'' Cox
said. ``I do not want to say we would go out of business. But our
future is a lot more certain with TCI.''

<HEAD>Shearson Posts Quarterly Profit Following Year-ago Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., reversing
a loss from a year ago, on Wednesday reported a $66 million profit
in the third quarter from sharply higher revenue.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Shearson netted $64 a
share, compared with a loss of $3 million, or 11 cents a share, in
the 1988 period, when the brokerage company had $25 million in
pre-tax expenses from the acquisition of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
   Quarterly revenue jumped 25 percent to $3.3 billion from $2.6
million last year.
   Shearson said higher commissions and revenue from market making
and principal transactions more than offset lower investment
banking revenue and an increase in expenses.
   Expenses totaled $3.2 billion in the third quarter, up 21
percent from $2.6 billion last year, the company said. During the
quarter, Shearson said it began relocating employees to a new
office facility in New York, which should ultimately help control
costs.
   Shearson's earnings for the first nine months of 1989 were off 3
percent, totaling $106 million, or 98 cents a share, from $110
million, or $1.05, last year. Revenue jumped 26 percent to $9.6
billion from $7.6 billion.
   However, expenses also rose 26 percent to $9.4 billion from $7.5
billion, the company said.
   Results for the nine-month period of last year included $144
million in pre-tax merger-related expenses.
   Shearson is a subsidiary of financial giant American Express Co.

   The stock market hovered at slightly higher
levels today after an early selling wave subsided.
   The California earthquake appeared to be doing little damage to
the market and many stocks actually benefited as investors bought
companies that could prosper from the devastation in the San
Francisco Bay area.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, down about 12
points in the first 30 minutes of trading, had reversed course to
post a 10.45-point gain at 2,649.18 by noon on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 7 to 5 where 755 stocks were up in price, 541
were down and 505 were unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.93 to 189.82.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 85.44 million
shares, down from 125.48 million at midday on Tuesday.
   Activity on Wall Street seemed more subdued compared with the
hectic trading that began with Friday's 190-point tumble in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   After a brief selloff, some insurance stocks rose amid
speculation that heavy quake-related claims, coming after losses
from Hurricane Hugo, could lead insurers to raise premium rates,
enhancing the industry's profitability.
   Travelers gained ~ to 40}, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty added 1 to 50[
and Chubb rose ~ to 81]. San Francisco-based Transamerica, however,
was off \ to 42}.
   Some contruction stocks surged in anticipaton of greater demand
for cement and other building materials on account of the quake.
Cement makers Lone Star Industries rose 2 to 29{ and Calmat added 3
to 29.
   Technology stocks appeared to shrug off initial concerns in the
market about problems at Silicon Valley facilities. Apple Computer
rose } to 48 and Intel was unchanged at 33{.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the San Franciso-based utility, fell {
to 19{.
   Chevron, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, rose \ to
64\ in heavy trading.
   Other active blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
unchanged at 42\, Philip Morris, up [ to 43], and International
Business Machines, up ] to 102|.
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, headed the Big Board's actives
list, and gained 1] to 74|. The stock had taken a dive earlier this
week on word that Donald Trump had withdrawn his $7 billion bid for
the airline holding company.
   The recent turbulence in the stock market had been intensified
by confusion surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL. A tumble in
shares of the parent of United Airlines helped trigger Friday's
megadrop.
   The slide in UAL slowed as the stock lost 2{ to 195{. The
selling apparently was in reaction to word that Los Angeles
financier Marvin Davis has withdrawn his backup $300-a-share,
all-cash bid for United Airlines' parent.
   Meanwhile, new evidence of weakening economic activity led to
speculation that a significant slowdown might be a serious drag on
corporate profits.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department said housing
construction fell 5.2 percent in September to the lowest level
since the 1982 recession.

<HEAD>Trinova Announces Layoff of 1,500 Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trinova Corp. announced a major
restructuring Wednesday that includes reducing or closing around
three dozen facilities and laying off 1,500 employees over the next
three years.
   The company, which supplies equipment to the aerospace and
transportation industries, said it lost $29.7 million, or 87 cents
a share, in the third quarter as a result of a $38.5 million
provision taken for the restructing.
   That compared with a profit of $19.64 million, or 57 cents a
share, in 1988. Sales in the latest quarter rose 8 percent to $456
million from $422 million.
   ``The summer slowdown in automotive production seriously
affected our automotive plastics operations,'' President Darryl
Allen said in a statement.
   ``Lower U.S. defense sales and inefficiencies in the Aeroquip
operations also contributed to weaker results in power and motion
control.''
   As part of its restructuring, which is primarily related to its
Aeroquip Corp. subsidiary, Trinova said it will downsize or close
40 of its 170 facilities.
   That would result in layoffs of around 1,500 employees, all
technical and administrative workers, in the next three years, or 8
percent of its approximately 19,000 work force.
   The company also said it will take several steps to reduce
costs, such as improving production and reconfigurating the factory
floor.
   ``I am confident that these actions will improve the performance
of Trinova's companies ... and accelerate our earnings growth,''
Allen said.
   Trinova, formerly known as Libbey-Owens Ford Co., also operates
the subsidiary Vickers Inc.

   It's a child's delight _ rows of bright
red, yellow and green crayons that pop out of molding machines,
roll along conveyor belts and slip into little boxes that have
become a fixture in any toy store.
   But Binney &amp; Smith is making more than Crayola crayons at its
plant in this small Kansas town south of Wichita. The 85-year-old
company has branched into art products designed to appeal to
everyone from toddlers to professionals, as part of a larger
diversification plan by parent company Hallmark Cards Inc.
   The Kansas City-based cardmaker bought Binney &amp; Smith for $200
million five years ago, shortly after Irvine O. Hockaday Jr. became
Hallmark's president and chief executive officer. Hockaday has
since steered Hallmark into markets ranging from real estate to
Spanish-language television, but he still thinks his first buy was
a good one.
   ``It's hard to match the criteria we set,'' Hockaday said. ``But
Binney &amp; Smith is incomparable as far as people recognizing the
Crayola name and having good feelings about it. We thought that
feeling could be widened to different age groups, and we were
right.''
   Binney &amp; Smith plants in Winfield and at the subsidiary's
headquarters in Easton, Pa., now turn out about 9 million crayons a
day in 72 colors.
   But with marketing help from Hallmark, they also make new and
higher-priced lines of washable felt-tip markers and paints for
youngsters, and more precise erasable colored mechanical pencils
for older children. They also produce the company's Liquitex brand
of acrylic paints used by art students and professional artists.
   Last year, Binney &amp; Smith even began selling coloring books.
   ``Our crayon market has always been as stable as any market can
be,'' said Jim Wilson, manager of the Winfield plant. But parents
were looking for other products for their children.
   ``We knew mothers would love this,'' Wilson said of the felt-tip
markers printed with ``erasable'' in large letters. ``They were
telling us they wanted it to keep markers off the furniture and
walls.''
   In addition, the company is selling its products in new places,
from hotels to airlines, and planning more products targeted toward
teen-agers and the growing adult crafts market.
   ``The teen-age and young-adult market is enormous,'' Hockaday
said. ``We feel we can migrate the feelings that a young person has
toward Crayola into other products as they move into the pre-teen
years and then beyond.''
   So far, the theory seems to be working. Hallmark doesn't reveal
financial figures because it is privately owned, but Hockaday said
Binney &amp; Smith and its 1,300 employees have done slightly better
than Hallmark forecast five years ago. Its revenues and profits
have been growing by double digits in the last few years, he said.
   Hallmark itself, which had sales of $2.3 billion in 1988, still
specializes in greeting-cards and the related products in dealers'
stores.
   Its lines of greeting cards, including the Hallmark line and the
mass-market Ambassador line sold in grocery and drug stores,
account for 44 percent of all U.S. card sales.
   But officials decided they needed to diversify for the future of
the company owned by descendants of founder Joyce Hall and some
employees.
   ``We don't see any serious clouds on the horizon of our core
business, but theoretically, technology could eat into the
greeting-card business a bit in the future,'' Hockaday said. ``And
theoretically, rapidly increasing postal rates if they occurred
could slow our sales.''
   In 1987 and 1988, Hallmark bought 10 Spanish-language television
stations and a Spanish-language TV network based in Los Angeles.
   The company had some experience making greeting cards for
Hispanic customers but felt the market had been mostly overlooked
by advertisers in the past, Hockaday said.
   ``The Hispanic market is growing faster than any other market
segment that I'm aware of,'' Hockaday said. ``We think it's one of
those unique, niche, growth opportunities.''
   Future acquisitions are under consideration, Hockaday said, but
Hallmark officials view the market as ``overheated'' right now and
are acting cautiously.
   Meanwhile at the Winfield plant, crayons now share floor space
with washable markers. But it's still crayons that most fascinate
the local schoolchildren who regularly tour the plant, said plant
manager Wilson.
   ``Their appeal is enduring,'' he said. ``That's our greatest
strength.''

   The U.S. dollar turned mixed in active European
trading Wednesday as the disasterous California earthquake had
little impact on foreign exchange.
   Gold prices were higher.
   ``This was a directionless market, but there was high trading
volume,'' said a dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt. ``We all
watched the stock exchange, but it never helped to establish a
clear direction.''
   The earthquake, which rocked through northern California on
Tuesday, and Erich Honecker's removal as East Germany's leader had
little apparent impact on exchange markets, dealers said.
   Traders said the market was awaiting Thursday's release of the
U.S. consumer price index figures for September.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a closing 142.10 Japanese yen from
142.25 yen Tuesday. Later, in London, it dropped to 141.40 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5880 from $1.5835 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8525 West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.6255 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6227; 6.2990 French francs, up from 6.2960; 2.0818 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0867; 1.1737 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1755; and 1,366.00 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.25 a troy ounce
from $367.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $368.50 an
ounce from $367.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.72 to close at $368.38 an
ounce.
   Silver fell in London to a late bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce
from $5.12 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Media General Puts 31 Weekly Newspapers Up for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. has put up for sale 31
weekly newspapers in Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley area,
saying the papers are too far from its base in Virginia.
   The Richmond, Va.-based firm announced the planned sale Tuesday,
adding that the decision was also prompted by a desire to
concentrate on its chain of daily newspapers.
   The papers it wants to sell constitute Golden West Publishing
Inc. and are to be sold as a unit.
   They include nine published by South Orange County News in
Mission Viejo and 22 run by Highlander Publications of the City of
Industry. All but one are distributed to community residents free
of charge.
   A statement issued by Media General said that ``management
demands for the West Coast operations are no longer prudent,'' and
that ``we prefer to concentrate our efforts on daily newspaper
operations.''
   Media General owns newspapers in Richmond and Tampa, Fla., and
television and cable systems elsewhere in the Southeast.
   Golden West chief executive Ron Redfern said the papers have a
combined circulation of 487,000 and gross annual revenues of about
$15 million.
   He would not disclose the asking price, but said that weekly
newspapers usually sell for one to two times their gross revenues.
   A number of companies had expressed interest, Redfern said, but
he declined not identify them.
   Golden West was formed in 1980 and 1981 with the purchase of
several small weekly newspaper chains. Redfern said the company
initially had planned to convert one or more of the papers to
dailies but later changed its plans.
   Media General successfully defended itself against a hostile
takeover attempt last year by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman and
sold its only other West Coast operation, a paper mill in Pomona,
to Sugarman after his bid failed.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rallied Wednesday to close sharply
higher after fears subsided over what effect the California
earthquake would have on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6
points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 2,170.1, its high for the day.
   The key index had been under pressure most of the morning over
concerns that possible economic effects of the earthquake would
undermine prices on Wall Street and translate into sharper declines
for British stocks.
   But London's fortunes turned after dealers reappraised the
direct impact of the disaster and New York rebounded from its early
disaster-led losses.
   ``Wall Street didn't collapse, so there was no reason for London
to,'' a dealer with the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
noted.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished 27.8 points higher
at 1,758.5 points. The Financial Times 500-share index closed at
1,202.54, up 20.8 points.
   Volume was 449.3 million shares traded, the lightest this week
and down from 643.4 million shares on Tuesday.
   British insurance stocks, which some equity analysts forecast
might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster, helped underpin
London by staging only narrow losses in early dealings.
   Dealers said the market still has not shaken off its nervousness
after the sharp declines of recent sessions, which resulted from a
190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.
   But technical factors, including modest gains in the British
pound, helped draw buying back into the market and at least reverse
losses posted a day earlier.

   The stock market hovered at slightly higher
levels today, steadying after three hectic sessions.
   The California earthquake appeared to be doing little damage to
the market and many stocks actually benefited as investors bought
companies that could prosper from the destruction in the San
Francisco Bay area.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 10.86 to
2,649.59 at by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 3 to 2 where 829 stocks were up in price, 565

   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks
increased 0.83 to 189.72.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 124.47 million
shares with 2 hours left to go.
   Activity on Wall Street seemed more subdued compared with the
chaotic trading that began with Friday's 190-point tumble in the
Dow Jones industrial average.
   Insurance stocks rose on speculation that heavy quake-related
claims, coming after losses from Hurricane Hugo, could lead
insurers to raise premium rates, enhancing the industry's
profitability.

<HEAD>Pfizer Earnings Flat; Schering-Plough, American Home Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer Inc. said Wednesday its earnings
were flat in the third quarter, while Schering-Plough Corp. and
American Home Products Corp. said profits increased compared with
the same period last year.
   New York-based Pfizer said net income was about the same in the
three-month period as in 1988 because of new product launches and
larger research and development costs.
   Pfizer reported net income of $217.5 million, or $1.29 a share,
on sales of $1.44 billion for the quarter, compared with $216.8
million, or $1.29 a share, on sales of $1.38 billion in the same
1988 period.
   Pfizer said health care sales increased 3 percent and consumer
products sales rose 23 percent, while speciality chemicals sales
were flat and agricultural sales fell 5 percent.
   Pfizer attributed the flat earnings to the introduction of newly
approved drugs for angina, hypertension and cardiovascular disease,
and a coronary angioplasty catheter. Pfizer said its research and
development expenses increased 11 percent for the quarter.
   Fot the first nine months of 1989, Pfizer reported a 9 percent
earnings decline to $594 million, or $3.52 a share, from $650
million, or $3.86 a share. Sales rose 4 percent to $4.18 billion
from $4.02 billion.
   Schering-Plough said its earnings increased 20.8 percent despite
poor exchange rates and the sale of its European cosmetics
businesses.
   The Madison, N.J.-based pharmaceutical and health care company
said net earnings were $114 million, or $1.01 a share, up from
$94.4 million, or 84 cents a share, in same 1988 period.
   Third-quarter sales rose 3 percent to $743.7 million from $724.4
million, the company said. Quarterly sales of the company's
worldwide consumer products business declined 12 percent.
   For the first nine months of the year, Schering-Plough reported
a 21.3 percent profit rise to $360 million, or $3.20 a share, from
$297 million, or $2.65 a share. Sales were $2.38 billion, up from
$2.23 billion in the first nine months of 1988.
   American Home Products, based in New York, said third-quarter
earnings rose 11 percent to $266.2 million, or $1.80 a share, from
$240.7 million, or $1.65 a share. Sales rose 7 percent to $1.51
billion from $1.42 billion in the 1988 period.
   From January through September, American Home said earnings rose
11 perecnt to $766.7 million, or $5.21 a share, from $693.5
million, or $4.75 a share. Sales for the period increased to $4.43
billion from $4.20 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Companies Inc. said Wednesday its
third-quarter earnings climbed 20.5 percent as sales soared 45.4
percent, reflecting the inclusion of results from Kraft Inc.
acquired late last year.
   Philip Morris, which makes such widely-known brands as Marlboro
cigarettes, Miller beer, Oscar Mayer meats and Post cereals, said
it earned $748 million, or 81 cents a share, in the three months
ended Sept. 30, compared with $621 million, or 67 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue soared to $11.25 billion from $7.74
billion a year earlier.
   Operating revenue was up from the company's cigarette operations
as unit sales. Higher beer volume at the Miller Brewing Co. led to
higher operating revenue in that division as well. The company
provided no specific figures.
   Philip Morris said revenue at the combined Kraft General Foods
division was up for the quarter, despite weakness in Post cereals.
   Philip Morris acquired Kraft on Dec. 7, 1988, and Kraft results
are included in the company's consolidated results only since the
date of acquisition.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Philip Morris said it earned
$2.08 billion, or $2.25 a share, up 4.4 percent from $2 billion, or
$2.13 a share, a year earlier. The 1988 results were increased by
$273 million because of a change in the method of accounting for
income taxes. Excluding the accounting change, earnings were up 21
percent from a year ago.
   Nine-month revenue rose 45.5 percent to $33.61 billion from
$23.10 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Trinova Corp. Announces Layoff of 1,500 Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trinova Corp. announced Wednesday it would
lay off 1,500 employees in its second restructuring in as many
years.
   Thomas Ainsworth, a spokesman for the suburban Toledo-based
company, said 40 of the company's 170 plants would be closed or
reduced. Ainsworth declined comment on which plants would be
affected.
   Trinova, formerly known as Libbey-Owens Ford Co., operates
Aeroquip Corp. and Vickers Inc., which supply power and motion
control systems, components and plastic products to the aerosapce
and transportation industries.
   The layoffs will affect technical and administrative employees.
The company has 20,000 employees worldwide, including 230 at its
Maumee world headquarters.
   ``I am confident that these actions will improve the performance
of Trinova's companies, Aeroquip and Vickers, and accelerate our
earnings growth,'' said Darryl Allen, Trinova's president and chief
executive officer.
   Last October, the company announced it merged two subsidiaries
because they shared a variety of customers.
   ``The summer slowdown in automotive production seriously
affected our automotive plastics operations,'' Allen said. ``Lower
U.S. defense sales and inefficiencies in the Aeroquip operations
also contributed to weaker results in power and motion control.''
   Some anaylsts said they were surprised by the size of Trinova's
restructring, but that it would benefit the company in the long run.
   James McCann, an analyst with Drexel Burnham, said the move will
help the company become more competitive in the face of increasing
foreign competition.
   ``It doesn't mean it won't be painful in the short term for the
people who are involved, but the U.S. industry is becoming more
competitive, and Trinova has taken the bull by the horns,'' McCann
said.
   The restructuring resulted in a charge of $38.5 million, after
taxes, against Trinova's 1989 third-quarter earnings, producing a
loss of $29.7 million, or 87 cents a share.
   Trinova earned $19.4 million during the 1988 third quarter, or
57 cents a share.
   Sales in the third quarter increased 8 percent, to $456.2
million, up from 1988 third-quarter sales of $422 million.
   Sales for the first nine months increased 11.6 percent, to $1.44
billion, compared with sales in the first nine months of 1988 of
$1.29 billion.
   Earnings through the first nine months of the year were $13.1
million, or 38 cents a share, after deducting the restructuring
provision. In the same period in 1988, the company earned $61.6
million, or $1.79 a share.

<HEAD>AMR Reports Decline In Third Quarter Earnings, `Unhappy' Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp. reported Wednesday its
third-quarter earnings fell nearly 9 percent, and Chairman Robert
L. Crandall said the fourth-quarter outlook for the parent of
American Airlines was ``unhappy.''
   Crandall attributed the poor showing, which had been expected,
to higher fuel costs and lower revenue per passenger mile.
   The announcement came two days after billionaire Donald Trump
withdrew his $7 billion buyout proposal for AMR as the company's
stock fell in the overall Wall Street plunge.
   AMR said it earned $137 million, or $2.16 per share, in the
three-month ended Sept. 30, compared to $150.3 million, or $2.50
per share, in the same period last year.
   Revenue increased to $2.73 billion from $2.33 billion in the
same period last year.
   For the nine months, AMR's earnings were $415.9 million, or
$6.59 per share, an increase over 1988's $360.1 million, or $5.99
per share. Revenue in the nine-month period rose to $7.89 billion
from $6.46 billion.
   Crandall said in a statement that revenue per passenger mile was
down slightly during the quarter, and fuel prices were up more than
11 percent from the third quarter of 1988. The two factors took a
toll on AMR's results.
   ``Unfortunately, we think these trends will continue and will
produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well,'' Crandall
said. ``This unhappy outlook ... underscores the continuing
volatility of airline earnings and the importance of an adequate
capital base.''
   AMR never responded directly to Trump's proposal beyond saying
the company was opposed to highly leveraged deals and preferred to
remain independent.
   Analysts have suggested Trump was unable to get financing to
back his bid because of growing uncertainties over the future of
airline performance.
   Crandall told analysts last month profits through next year
would be squeezed by competition from a recovering Eastern
Airlines, higher labor costs, expansion of service and purchase of
new aircraft.

   The California earthquake registered only mildly
today on the nation's stock exchanges.
   Stocks of companies in San Francisco and Silicon Valley were
mixed, with some such as Apple Computer Inc. actually higher. Many
insurance stocks also rose, apparently on speculation that the
quake would provide an opportunity for the companies to raise rates.
   Building-materials suppliers and companies that supply disaster
recovery services for computer users also saw their stocks rise.
   Overall, the stock market wavered after a series of chaotic
sessions that began with Friday's 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones
30-stock industrial average.
   The Dow Jones average was up 0.41 points at 2,639.14 at 2:30
p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange. It had fallen in the
opening moments but was up more than 10 points by midday. The
number of advancing issues slightly outpaced decliners on the Big
Board.
   Apple Computer Inc. was up 50 cents at $47.75 a share and Intel
Corp. was up 25 cents at $33.75 in over-the-counter trading. On the
New York Stock Exchange, the biotechnology company Genentech Inc.
was off 12{ cents at $19.75 and Hewlett-Packard Co. was up 12{
cents at $45.87{.
   Among local utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric was down 37{
cents a share at $19.62{, while Pacific Telesis Group, parent of
Pacific Bell, was off 12{ cents at $45.12{.
   Chevron Corp., which has headquarters in San Francisco, was off
12{ cents at $63.87{.
   Among insurers, stocks rebounded quickly after a selloff
triggered by the earthquake. Some analysts said the quake could
produce more than $1 billion in claims, but that the quake losses,
coupled with losses from Hurricane Hugo, could trigger a round of
rate increases that would help the industry's profitability.
   San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp. was off 25 cents at
$42.75, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty was up $1.12{ at $58.25, Chubb Corp.
was up 75 cents at $81.25 and Travelers Corp. was up 37{ cents at
$40.25.
   The strongest performers among insurance stocks were the
so-called reinsurers that absorb risk from the policy-writing
firms. On the NYSE, General Re Corp. was up $2.62{ at $86.37{ and
Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. was up $3.25 a share at $76.
   Hardest hit was Everex Systems Inc., a maker of personal
computer equipment based in Fremont, Calif., on the east side of
San Francisco Bay. It was off 30 percent, falling $3.50 a share to
$8.12{ in over-the-counter dealings.
   Two companies that bail mainframe computer installations out of
disasters were higher: Comdisco rose $1.25 to $30.75 on the NYSE
and Sungard Data Systems Inc. climbed $2 to $21.50.
   Among the construction companies that gained from the quake were
Fluor Corp., up $1 to $33.62{; Morrison Knudsen, up $2.25 to $44;
and Foster Wheeler, up 62{ cents to $18.50. Building-materials
suppliers included Georgia-Pacific, up $1.75 to $58.50, and
Louisiana-Pacific, up $1.25 to $41.
   Volume on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange came to
124.47 million shares as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   Overseas, the Tuesday evening quake was blamed for declines on
the Australian and New Zealand markets, but stocks in Tokyo posted
moderate gains, with the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gaining
111.48 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 35,107.56.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
rose 34.6 points, or about 1.6 percent, to close at 2,170.1.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones average lost just under 19 points
Tuesday after weathering a late-morning scare that briefly sent it
down more than 60 points.
   Trading was relatively calm Tuesday after the Dow industrial
average plummeted 190 points Friday and then bounced back 88 points
Monday. The Dow Jones average fell 18.65 points to 2,638.73 Tuesday.
   Stocks lost little ground despite continued uncertainty
surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL Corp. and a government report
showing a bigger-than-expected trade deficit in August. The Federal
Reserve helped by adding a modest amount of reserves to the banking
system.

   Consumers recovering from serious debt problems
don't have to wait years, or pay through the nose, before
re-entering the world of plastic.
   American National Bank of New York announced Wednesday it can
provide many of those with tainted credit histories with a new Visa
credit card carrying an annual 12.5 percent interest rate, around
six percentage points below the national average.
   But there's a catch: applicants must put a minimum $500 into a
one-year certificate of deposit at the bank to be used as
collateral, and enroll in a counseling program with a non-profit
credit counseling service. The largest such organization is the
Maryland-based National Foundation for Consumer Credit, which
oversees a network of 400 counseling offices nationwide.
   One of the biggest of those offices, the Budget &amp; Credit
Counseling Services Inc. of New York, which counsels about 10,000
families and individuals a year, helped arrange for the American
National Visa card.
   ``America operates on credit, which means that even people with
past credit problems need a credit card to function effectively,''
explained Luther R. Gatling, president of the New York credit
counseling service.
   ``To be without credit undermines an individual's self-esteem.
It makes normal activities like business travel impractical, and
general consumerism in this country impossible.''
   The new credit card is secured by the CD. The line of credit is
limited to the amount of the deposit minus $250 for desposits
between $500 and $2,500, or 90 percent of a deposit between $2,501
and $10,000.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Legislation Blocking Certain Takeovers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee voted Wednesday to give the
Transportation Department authority to block major airline
takeovers, after backers of the bill said travelers want assurances
a purchaser's heavy debt would not jeopardize safety.
   Under the legislation, the Transportation Department would be
obligated to block the purchase of 15 percent of an airline's
voting stock if the deal would jeopardize safety, lead to a breakup
of the company, hinder its ability to compete, or leave the carrier
in the hands of a foreign interest.
   ``This bill does not prevent airline takeovers or significantly
interfere with an owner's property rights. It merely gives DOT the
opportunity to review those transactions that might harm the public
interest,'' said Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.
   ``Air travelers expect assurances that the heavy debt load
incurred during an acquisition will not lead to a deterioration of
safety,'' Hammerschmidt told the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee before it approved the bill by a vote of
23-5.
   Opponents claimed the bill could be the first step toward
congressional regulation of debt-financed takeovers, while
Hammerschmidt said the legisalation is similar to procedures used
by the Justice Department to review mergers under antitrust laws.
   ``The government doesn't have a role in determining individual
transactions and second-guessing the market place,'' countered Rep.
Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., calling the bill an impediment to the
economics of the airline industry.
   The committee defeated an amendment by Rep. Peter DeFazio,
D-Ore., which would have barred a takeover if it would result in a
major reduction of wages, benefits or workers.
   With the bill restricting a buyer from selling off a big part of
an airline's assets, DeFazio told the committee: ``You're now
leaving the employees naked in this bill to take all the cuts.''
   The House bill, similar to legislation approved by the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, had been rushed
through Congress because of concerns about Donald Trump's attempts
to takeover AMR Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, parent company of
American Airlines.
   Trump, a New York billionaire, withdrew his $7.5 billion bid on
Monday, hours before the House aviation subcommittee passed the
legislation, but said he may make another bid for the country's
largest airline.
   Members of the House committee said they were approving the bill
in the face of a possible veto by President Bush. Deputy
Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao said Monday the the
administration strongly opposes the bill and that DOT has
sufficient authority to act when an acquisition raises concerns
about an airline's fitness.
   As a result of mergers and acquisitions in the years since
deregulation, the number of major carriers has dropped from 22 to
eight, which now control 90 percent of domestic traffic, said Rep.
James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the aviation subcommittee.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. said its
third-quarter income rose 3 percent on the strenghth of increased
sales for jet engines, air conditioning systems and elevators.
   UTC said it earned $196.7 million, or $1.46 per share, up from
$190.1 million, or $1.45 per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $4.75 billion from $4.47 billion
last year.
   UTC subsidiaries _ Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, Otis, Carrier
air contioners and Sikorsky helicopters _ all reported increased
revenue during the period, UTC Chairman Robert F. Daniell said.
   For the first nine months, UTC earned $517.7 million, or $3.91
per share, compared to $508.5 million, or $3.89 a share, for the
same period in 1988.
   Revenue during the first three quarters totaled $14.49 billion,
compared to $13.25 billion a year earlier.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney received $9.5 billion in commercial jet engine
orders during the first nine months of the year, a 90 percent
increase over the $5 billion in commercial jet engine orders
received in all of 1988, Daniell said.
   ``The continued strong demand for Pratt &amp; Whitney's
new-trechnology commercial engines will pay off for years to
come,'' Danielle said.
   UTC's other subsidiaries include Norden and Hamilton Standard.
Norden produces radar and other defense systems, while Hamilton
Standard manufactures components used in space shuttles and
astronaut space suits.

<HEAD>Sovran Says Earnings Up 12 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sovran Financial Corp., which plans to merge with Citizens &amp;
Southern Corp. to create the nation's 14th-largest banking company,
on Wednesday reported a 12 percent rise in its third-quarter profit
over a year ago.
   Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $69.2
million, or $1.15 a share, compared with earnings of $61.9 million,
or $1.04 a share, a year ago.
   For the first nine months, its earnings were $196.6 million, or
$3.28 a share, up 12 percent from a profit of $175.0 million, or
$2.94 a share, in 1988.
   Chairman Albert B. Gornto Jr. attributed the improved results to
higher revenue, both net interest and non-interest.
   Norfolk, Va.-based Sovran last month announced an agreement with
Atlanta-based C&amp;S to combine operations in a stock swap under a new
holding company to be called Avantor Financial Corp.
   The merger would create the nation's 14th-largest bank holding
company with $47 billion in assets, $34 billion in deposits and 976
branches in eight states in the Southeast.
   The transaction is pending approval of regulatory authorities
and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1990.

   The company said Wednesday that the soft drink will be
introduced first in Charlotte, N.C., and in markets yet to be named
the following week.
   ``We believe the timing is right,'' said Ira C. Herbert,
president of Coca-Cola USA. ``Not only is the caffeine-free cola
segment growing rapidly, Coca-Cola Classic continues to experience
steady sales and share gains.''
   The new product will carry a gold label, while regular Coke
Classic has a red label.
   The company said a date for national distribution will depend on

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose for the third
consecutive day Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
speculation that the Soviet Union was looking to buy a large
quantity of U.S. soybean oil.
   Grain futures closed mixed.
   Expectations that the Soviets would purchase 50,000 to 75,000
metric tons of soybean oil at subsidized prices supplanted the
rumors of Soviet interest in soybeans and soybean meal that
supported the market Tuesday.
   Forecasts for foul weather in the Midwest on Thursday and Friday
also supported the soybean market, said Joel Karlin, an analyst
with Research Department Inc., a Chicago-based brokers' advisory
service.
   ``We are supposed to get quite a bit of rain and cold
temperatures, and that could limit harvesting of soybeans in the
eastern Corn Belt,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3\ cents lower to 4 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06\ a
bushel; corn futures were } cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents higher

   Economic growth in the 12-nation
European Economic Community will reach 3.5 percent this year, up
from the 3.25 percent forecast in June, its executive body said
Wednesday.
   In its annual economic report, the European Commission projected
economic growth next year at 3 percent, after adjustment for
inflation.
   It said the inflation rate was likely to run 4.8 percent in
1989, up from the 3.6 percent recorded last year. It said, though,
the rate should slow to 4.5 percent in 1990.
   Henning Christophersen, who handles the commission's budget
affairs, said unemployment might fall below 9 percent as some 1.5
million jobs are created next year.
   But he said unemployment remained well above levels earlier in
the decade, and that there would have to be ``a continuing
improvement of the economy before the unemployment situation
becomes acceptable.''

<TEXT>
   Beazer PLC, a British building materials and
construction company, on Wednesday reported a 22 percent jump in
after-tax profit for its latest financial year, helped largely by
contributions from its U.S. unit, Koppers Co.
   Beazer said after-tax profit for the year ended June 30 came to
$147 million, or 92.6 million pounds, compared with $120 million a
year earlier.
   Earnings per share came to 48 cents, up from 39 cents.
   Sales for the year jumped 47 percent to $3.1 billion from $2.1
billion.
   Beazer said its strong performance in the 1988-89 fiscal year
was due to a strong input from Koppers and a sturdy performance in
the British housing and property market.
   Beazer acquired Koppers Co. last year.
   The British company did not break out quarterly or half-year
results. It is not required to under British law.

<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have seized records and shut a
``boiler room'' operation of a telemarketing firm suspected of
bilking thousands of credit card holders in a huge and highly
organized fraud case.
   The company, American Tele-Digital, called on credit card
holders outside Florida and asked them to buy a service that
notifies all credit card companies if the cards are lost or stolen,
investigators said.
   ``Last year, we dealt with about half-a-dozen fraud schemes, and
this one is the most organized and probably the largest we've
seen,'' said Richard Cataldo, a security agent for American Express
Co.
   Officials raided and closed American Tele-Digital, seized
records and subpoenaed employees, Chief Assistant State Attorney
Ric Ridgway said Tuesday.
   American Tele-Digital was set up as a telephone ``boiler room''
where sales people telephoned credit card holders and fraudulently
obtained their card numbers before billing fees to their accounts
without permission, said Jennifer Fanzlaw of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   Employees called credit card holders and claimed they worked for
the company authorized to insure their cards, Ms. Fanzlaw said.
   ``The company then advised they needed their credit card number
to verify they were the current holder, or if they wanted to cancel
the protection,'' Ms. Fanzlaw said.
   With the numbers, the company was able to bill fees to
customers' accounts without their permission, Ms. Fanzlaw said,
adding: ``That is where the scam came in.''

<HEAD>Terms of StatesWest Offer for Mesa Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Airlines Inc. said Wednesday that
StatesWest Airlines Inc. had offered $15.3 million in cash and
securities for all the common stock in Mesa that the Phoenix-based
airline doesn't already own.
   The offer values the entire company at $16.5 million.
   Gary Risley, Mesa's vice president for corporate affairs, said
StatesWest is offering $10 _ $7 a share in cash plus StatesWest
securities with a value of $3 per share _ for each Mesa share.
   The offer was made in a letter to Mesa from StatesWest Chairman
Rudy Miller. StatesWest had asked Mesa's board of directors to keep
the terms confidential, but Mesa announced the terms Wednesday.
   Risley said Mesa has 1.65 million shares of stock. StatesWest
acquired 7.25 percent of the stock in May, and Miller said Tuesday
he had purchased ``a little stock in the last couple of days,'' but
declined to say how much.
   Risley said Tuesday the StatesWest proposal would be referred to
Mesa's board for consideration along with recommendations from
Mesa's financial and legal advisers.
   ``We believe that the terms we have proposed are fair and
generous and in the best interest of the Mesa shareholders,''
Miller said Tuesday in announcing the proposal.
   ``Because we are making this offer on a friendly basis, we are
first submitting it to the board of directors for its review and
consideration,'' Miller said.
   ``We hope to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal with
Mesa's board of directors in the near future,'' he said.
   Last week, Mesa officials said they had no interest in a
friendly takeover proposal by StatesWest, and later in the week
Mesa announced it was examining the possibility of buying Air
Midwest of Wichita, Kan.
   StatesWest serves cities in Arizona, southern California and
Nevada.
   Mesa serves cities in New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Texas and
Arizona. A recently acquired Mesa subsidiary, Milwaukee-based
Skyway Airlines, serves cities in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan
and Wisconsin.

   Stock prices posted modest gains today as the
market calmed after three skittish sessions.
   The California earthquake didn't do noticeable damage to the
market; some companies' stocks benefited as investors bought on the
hunch that business might boom during cleanup of the destruction in
the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``Today was very perculiar,'' said Peter Canelo, chief
investment strategist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``We have an
earthquake and the market calms down.''
   Activity on Wall Street was subdued compared to the chaotic
trading that began with Friday's 190-point tumble in the Dow Jones
industrial average. Computer-guided maneuvers, which had tugged
stock prices up and down during the three previous sessions,
weren't much of a factor in today's trading.
   Insurance stocks rose amid speculation that heavy quake-related
claims, coming after losses from Hurricane Hugo, could lead
insurers to raise premium rates, enhancing the industry's
profitability. There also was speculation that the big temblor
Tuesday could increase demand for earthquake insurance coverage.
   Some contruction stocks surged in anticipaton of greater demand
for cement and other building materials on account of the quake.
Technology stocks appeared to shrug off initial concerns in the
market about problems at Silicon Valley facilities.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric fell ] to 19| but the San Francisco-based
utility said recovering from the quake wouldn't put a significant
financial strain on the company.
   Chevron, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, rose 1 to
65 in heavy trading.
   AMR, which rose } to 74, was the most heavily traded issue on
the New York Stock Exchange as more than 2.8 million shares changed
hands.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. announced Wednesday its
third quarter earnings rose 15.2 percent despite a drop in revenue.
   The business information company said it earned $155.3 million,
or 83 cents per share, up from $134.8 million, or 72 cents per
share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Revenue declined to $1.04 billion from $1.07 billion.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said sales were hurt by several factors,
including the strength of the dollar in overseas transactions and
the absence of revenue from its Official Airlines Guides business.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold OAG last year.
   Without those factors, the company said its revenue would have
increased 6 percent.
   For the first nine months of the year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it
earned nearly $449 million, or $2.40 per share, up 19.4 percent
from $375.9 million, or $2.01 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the nine-month period increased 0.8 percent to $3.16
billion from $3.13 billion a year earlier. Without the same factors
that affected the third-quarter figure, revenue would have
increased 8 percent, the company said.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's segments include Moody's Investor Service,
Nielsen Marketing Research and its Donnelly yellow pages publishing
business.

   Viacom Inc., a communications and entertainment
concern, said Wednesday its loss for the third quarter narrowed to
$21.7 million as earnings from operations climbed 42 percent and
revenues rose 11 percent.
   The company, which has interests in broadcasting and cable
television and owns MTV Networks Inc. and Showtime Networks Inc.,
said its loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 amounted to 41
cents per share and contrasted with a loss of $56.9 million, or
$1.07 per share, in 1988.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $345.5 million from $311.6 million
a year earlier.
   Earnings from operations climbed to $47.4 million in the quarter
from $33.3 million a year earlier.
   The company blamed its quarterly loss primarily on interest
expenses.
   The company recently announced a restructuring of its bank debt
and said the new 10-year $1.5 billion unsecured financing agreement
will give it significant interest rate savings and increased
operating flexibility.
   Viacom said its networks segment, which includes basic cable
service from MTV and pay-TV service from Showtime, posted 17
percent higher revenue for the quarter while earnings from
operations more than doubled to $30.4 million.
   The announcement comes a day after Viacom said it agreed to sell
a 50 percent interest in Showtime Networks, the second largest
pay-TV service, for $225 million to the cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver.
   For the quarter, earnings from operations were up 24 percent in
entertainment, up 2 percent in cable television and off 10 percent
in broadcasting.
   For the first nine months, Viacom said it earned $142.7 million,
or $2.67 a share, in contrast to a loss of $162.7 million, or $3.05
a share, a year earlier.
   The latest figures include a pre-tax gain of $313.1 million from
the sale of the cable systems on Long Island, N.Y., and in
Cleveland.
   Nine-month revenue rose 16 percent to $1.05 billion from $903.1
million in 1988.
   Viacom is 83-percent owned by National Amusements Inc., a
Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain controlled by Sumner Redstone.

<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. reported Wednesday that its
third-quarter profit fell 24 percent over a year ago due to
weakness in construction and industrial markets.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30 Manville netted $40.39
million, or 30 cents a share, compared with net income of $53.49
million, or 44 cents, a year ago. Sales were fairly flat, totaling
$549.82 million, vs. $545.86 million in 1988.
   ``We continued to experience strong performances from our
worldwide forest products business,'' said Tom Stephens, Manville
president and chief executive officer. ``However, weaknesses were
seen in our construction and industrial markets resulting in a
fall-off in profitability in our fiber glass and specialty products
segments.''
   Manville also said that its emergence from Chapter 11 federal
bankruptcy reorganization during last year's fourth quarter
continued to impact earnings due partly to increased interest
expenses.
   For the first nine months of this year, Manville's earnings were
$144.14 million, or 91 cents per share, on sales of $1.62 billion.
That compared with a profit of $15.36 million, or 98 cents a share,
and sales of $1.54 billion, last year.
   Manville's primary businesses include wood and paper products,
packaging, fiber glass and industrial insulation products, roofing
systems and filtration and minerals.

Drop</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede CHICAGO</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with BellSouth results.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ameritech Corp., the telephone company serving the Midwest, said
Wednesday its third-quarter profits rose 2.8 percent while
BellSouth, another regional phone company, said its earnings dipped
3.6 percent as the firm refinanced long-term debt.
   Ameritech reported earnings of $289.1 million, or $1.06 per
share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $281.1
million, or $1.03 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Third-quarter revenue increased 1.9 percent to $2.55 billion
from $2.51 billion, the Chicago-based company said in a prepared
statement.
   ``Increased calling volumes from our regulated business and
continued growth from our unregulated businesses were offset
somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators upon
our Bell operating companies,'' Chairman William L. Weiss said in
the statement.
   Expenses rose 2.6 percent, including one-time, pre-tax charges
of $40 million in signing bonuses related to three-year contract
settlements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers and the Communications Workers of America. The CWA
settlement ended an 18-day strike.
   BellSouth reported third-quarter earnings of $404.4 million, or
84 cents per share, down from $419.6 million, or 89 cents per
share, in the same quarter of 1988.
   Revenue rose to $3.55 billion from $3.46 billion a year earlier.
   The Atlanta-based company attributed the earnings decline to
restructuring of $481 million in long-term debt. While the move
resulted in an earnings decline, the company said it would
ultimately save $250 million by refinancing.
   For the first nine months, Ameritech reported its earnings fell
2.3 percent to $906.5 million, or $3.37 per share, from $927.7
million, or $3.40 per share. Revenue for the period rose to $7.6
billion from $7.4 billion.
   The company said the decline in year-to-date earnings reflected
a gain of $42.1 million in last year's second quarter from the sale
of Ameritech's interest in Cantel, a Canadian cellular company, and
its third-quarter 1988 sale of Applied Data Research Inc., a
software subsidiary.
   BellSouth said it earned $1.27 billion, or $2.67 per share, up
2.1 percent from $1.25 billion, or $2.61 per share, for the same
period in 1988.
   BellSouth provides phone service in nine states: Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Tennessee.
   Ameritech owns Bell companies serving Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

   The dollar ended weaker Wednesday against key
foreign currencies after a mixed performance overseas, with the
disastrous California earthquake registering only a slight
influence on foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $368.70 a troy ounce, up $1.30 from
Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold of $367.70 an ounce, also $1.30 higher.
   Currency dealers said the dollar sank in overnight trading on
news of the catastrophic earthquake in northern California, but it
regained some ground on the strength of the U.S. stock market.
   Some company stocks, particularly those involved in insurance
and construction, benefited on the belief that business might pick
up during cleanup of the destruction in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Robert Ryan, senior currency trader for the Bank of New York,
said an unconfirmed report that the Federal Reserve moved to buy
dollars early in trading also helped support the dollar. However,
most dealers dismissed those rumors.
   Traders said the market was awaiting Thursday's release of
consumer price index figures for September, hoping they would shed
more light on the direction of the economy and inflation.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a closing 142.10 Japanese yen from
142.25 yen Tuesday. It traded at 141.40 yen in London and New York,
compared with 142.70 in New York Tuesday. The dollar was lower
against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5880 in London, up
from $1.5835 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was worth
$1.5922, up from $1.57575.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday's
quotes included: 1.8485 West German marks, down from 1.8672; 1.6243
Swiss francs, down from 1.6365; 6.2810 French francs, down from
6.3475; 1.17335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17555; and lira
1,362.00 Italian lire, down from 1,400.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday: 1.8525 West
German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.6255 Swiss francs, up from 1.6227;
6.2990 French francs, up from 6.2960; 2.0818 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.0867; 1.1737 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1755; and
1,366.00 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00.
   Gold gained in London to $368.25 an ounce from $367.75 bid late

   Stock prices posted modest gains Wednesday as
the market regained its composure after several jumpy sessions.
   Contrary to initial fears, the Northern California earthquake
didn't do much damage to the market. Some companies' stocks
benefited as investors bought on the hunch that business might boom
during the cleanup of the destruction in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Blue chips overcame a late flurry of selling and the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials finished with a gain of 4.92 at 2,643.65.
The key market measure now stands 74.39 points above the level
reached in Friday's 190-point plunge.
   Activity on Wall Street was subdued compared to the wild trading
that began Friday with the worst selloff since the crash of 1987,
which occurred exactly two years ago Thursday.
   Computer-guided maneuvers, which had tugged stock prices up and
down during the three previous sessions, weren't much of a factor
in Wednesday's trading.
   ``I think the market is showing signs of having stabilized.
Volume has moderated and we did not see the violent swings,'' said
Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in
Baltimore.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board eased to 166.90 million
shares from Tuesday's higher-than-normal 224.07 million shares and
Monday's enormous 416.29 million.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by less than 5 to 4
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 822 up, 668 down and 461 unchanged.
   Despite some early selling on worries about the extent of
liabilities, insurance group stocks generally rose amid speculation
that heavy quake-related claims _ on top of losses from Hurricane
Hugo _ could lead insurers to raise premium rates, enhancing the
industry's profitability.
   There also was speculation that the big temblor Tuesday could
boost demand for earthquake insurance coverage.
   Insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan moved up 3 to 75~, General Re
rose 2} to 86{, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty added 2] to 59{ and American
International Group gained 3\ to 102|.
   Among other beneficiaries of the quake-related buying were
stocks of companies in construction, engineering and building
materials. Morrison Knudson rose 2] to 44[, Fluor rose } to 33] and
Georgia Pacific climbed 1\ to 58.
   Meanwhile, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric fell ] to 19| but the San
Francisco-based utility said recovering from the quake wouldn't put
a significant financial strain on the company.
   Chevron, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, rose 1 to
65.
   Other active blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
up \ at 42{, General Electric, down [ to 56] and International
Business Machines, down { to 101}.
   Philip Morris, which reported its third-quarter earnings climbed
20.5 percent, rose [ to 43] on volume of nearly 2.6 million shares,
making it the Big Board's second most heavily traded stock.
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, headed the actives' list, and
more than 2.8 million shares changed hands. It gained } to 74
despite news that its third-quarter earnings fell nearly 9 percent.
   Recent turbulence in the stock market had been intensified by
uncertainty surrounding a proposed buyout of UAL, owner of United
Airlines. The slide in UAL moderated Wednesday as the stock lost 6\
to 191}.
   Retailer Dayton Hudson, a major operator in California, rose 1
to 61[. The company said it will purchase 7 million of its shares
at 62~ under terms of a previously announced ``Dutch auction'' that
expired midnight Oct. 17.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 188.76 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $7.64 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks went
up 0.43 to 189.32.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.88 to 390.22, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished 0.60 higher at 341.76.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
3.35 to 463.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 378.07, up 2.91.

<HEAD>Some Turning Bearish As Copper Prices Dip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices slipped Wednesday to their lowest point
this month on New York's Commodity Exchange and some experts said
the market's 4-month-old rally may be weakening.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced; energy
futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures rose.
   Copper futures settled .40 cent to 2.85 cents lower with the
contract for December delivery at $1.2645 a pound, its lowest close
since Sept. 29.
   Some technical analysts interpreted the break below $1.27 as an
indicator of further losses to come, while fundamental analysts
cited significant changes in supply-and-demand factors.
   Chief among them was a report that the Mexican government was
nearing agreements with labor on terms for reopening the Cananea
copper mining and processing center, which closed Aug. 21 due to
alleged financial mismanagment.
   The mine is capable of producing 160,000 tons of copper
annually, about 3 percent of the world's total copper output.
   ``People were expecting it to open in mid-November but now it
looks like it may open before then,'' said Fred Demler, metals
economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   The news came in the aftermath of labor leaders' acceptance in
Canada of a contract that could lead to the reopening of the
Highland Valley copper mine near Logan Lake, B.C., if the agreement
is ratified by the rank-and-file.
   A reopening of the 180,000-tons-per-year Highland Valley mine,
which was shut down by a strike on July 6, would leave the
Bouganville mine in Papua New Guinea as the only major copper mine
still out of commission.
   Meanwhile, a government report of a 5.2 percent drop in U.S.
housing starts last month provided new evidence of economic
weakness and prompted speculation that demand for copper may soften
even as the supply picture improves.
   Analyst James Steel of the commodities brokerage Refco Inc. said
copper's fundamentals appeared to be ``slowly turning'' bearish.
   But Demler said the market's long-term outlook remained bullish.
As for the market's current weakness, he said, ``it's just had a
little bit of a head cold, I guess.''
   In precious-metals trading on the Comex, gold settled $1.30
higher across the board with October at $368.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 0.2 cent to 0.4 cent higher with December at $5.16 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures ended lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in technically inspired selling after gaining initially on supply
fears linked to the earthquake that rocked Northern California
Tuesday night.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 20 cents
lower with November at $20.56 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to
.54 cent lower with November at 60.60 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .57 cent to 1.26 cents lower with November at 54.58
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures rose for the third straight day on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid speculation that the Soviet Union is looking to
buy a large quantity of U.S. soybean oil. Grain futures closed
mixed.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with December at
$4.06\ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to \ cent higher with
December at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1{ cents higher
with December at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 4}
cents higher with November at $5.59} a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, strong cash markets
supported the live cattle and hog markets, but pork bellies
weakened amid uncertainty about when the government plans to ship
bellies to Poland as part of a food-aid package.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .95 cent higher with
October at 74.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower
to .07 cent higher with October at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were
.13 cent lower to .72 cent higher with October at 48.72 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to .80 cent lower with
February at 51.72 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures made modest gains on the Chicago Merc, where
the contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .65 point higher at 344.65.

<HEAD>Prices Unchanged to Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished little changed Wednesday in
more subdued dealings as the stock market stabilized, the dollar
fell and attention focused on an impending supply of new issues.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished with a gain of
1-32 point, or about 30 cents for every $1,000 in face amount. Its
yield held at 8.03 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   Analysts said bond prices rose as much as $5 for every $1,000 in
face value early in the session because of worries that the
potential economic consequences of the California earthquake would
send stock prices sharply lower.
   Stocks opened lower but quickly recovered and the Dow Jones
industrial average finished with a gain of nearly 5 points on the
day.
   As stocks recovered, bond prices relinquished some of their
gains.
   ``The bond market is still taking its cues from stock market
fluctuations and I expect that will continue for awhile,'' said
Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorporation of
Lawrenceville, N.J.
   He said bond traders feel that if stocks fall sharply, the
Federal Reserve is likely to encourage lower interest rates, a
positive development for bonds.
   But he said bond traders are likely to begin paying less
attention to gyrations in the stock market and focus more on
prospects for the economy.
   Other analysts said the dollar's decline in foreign exchange
trading and the prospect of new borrowing by the federal government
next week also weighed on bond prices.
   On Wednesday, the Treasury announced that it planned to sell $10
billion in new two-year notes next week and the Resolution Funding
Corp. said it planned to borrow $4.5 billion in 30-year bonds as
part of the thrift bailout.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to up 1-16 point, intermediate issues
were mixed with some down 1-32 point and others up 1-16 point and
long-term issues fell as much as 5-32 point, according to Telerate
Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.05 to 1,185.53.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, rose 0.07 to 336.74.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 10-32 point to 92 25-32 point. The
average yield to maturity rose to 7.31 percent from 7.29 percent
late Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.74 percent as the
discount lost 1 basis point to 7.50 percent. Yields on six-month
bills feld at 7.92 percent as the discount was unchanged at 7.52
percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.85 percent as the
discount fell 2 basis points to 7.34 percent.
   The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a
Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are
selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8} percent, up from 8 11-16 percent late
Tuesday.

   The vigorous economy of the San Francisco Bay
area should be little affected by the earthquake in the long run, a
top state official said Wednesday.
   ``We have a large, strong economy, and while the personal
tragedy for many families is great, the overall economic picture
for the Bay Area and the rest of the state is unclouded by this,''
said John Sullivan, the undersecretary of the state Department of
Business, Transportation and Housing.
   Sullivan, who stayed up all night assessing the situation, said
it was still too early to set a damage figure for the earthquake's
devastation. But he said, ``Overall the impact will be one the
state will recover from very quickly.''
   Insurers said the quake might have caused more than $1 billion
in damages in Northern California, just three weeks after Hurricane
Hugo resulted in an estimated $4 billion in damages in South
Carolina. However, only a fraction of the damages are covered by
insurance.
   Sullivan said he was optimistic about the insurance business.
   ``We don't have huge areas of just massive devastation, block
after block, fortunately,'' Sullivan said.
   While damage appeared extremely heavy in such cities as Santa
Cruz and Watsonville, Farmers Insurance Group Inc. spokesman
Jeffrey Beyer said he tended to agree with Sullivan that most
insurers would have no major problems.
   In a sign of investors' confidence in the state, California
municipal bond issues were down Wednesday, but only slightly and in
line with the overall decline in the market, said Mark Haslinger, a
senior vice president with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in New York.
   Traders at the Pacific Stock Exchange's main floor in San
Francisco worked by candlelight and flashlight, taking orders that
were then executed in Los Angeles, at the exchange's other trading
floor.
   Volume was ``very, very low,'' said exchange spokesman Navin
Vyas.
   Security Pacific Bank spokesman Richard Warner said his bank had
contacted the state's top 10 banks about setting up a coalition to
provide disaster recovery loans.
   Warner said backup computers kicked into action Tuesday night at
Security Pacific. Other banks and businesses like the San
Francisco-based Charles Schwab &amp; Co. discount brokerage also
reported that emergency systems had taken over and they were
conducting business.
   At Amdahl Corp., a Silicon Valley manufacturer of mainframe
computers, the computer system crashed, then was brought back up _
albeit at one-third the usual speed _ in a backup mode late Tuesday
night.
   Advanced Micro Devices Inc., another big Sunnyvale-based
high-tech company, said it called off the graveyard shift but
normal operations resumed with the start of the day shift.
   Pacific Bell said its network of equipment sustained only minor
damage. But heavy use disrupted calls into and out of the Bay Area
all day long Wednesday.
   State officials worked with businesses and local authorities to
reroute business commuter traffic around the crippled Bay Bridge.
   Banks and savings and loans struggled to reopen branches and
automated teller machines closed by power outages, downed phone
lines and structural damage.
   Many workers at non-essential industries stayed home as advised
by government officials.

<HEAD>Many Homeowners Not Insured; Analysts Say Disaster May Benefit Insurers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most San Francisco-area homeowners may
have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own
pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from
higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
   Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have
earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent
deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000
home, according to industry spokesmen.
   The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said
that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the
homes have earthquake insurance. The organization estimated
residential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in
the Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.
   Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get
reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is
covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn,
director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research
Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
   Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of
quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay. In addition to
home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile
damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due
to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers
compensation.
   Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1
billion or more from the quake. But industry observers said they
don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from
quake-related claims.
   ``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying
claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the
American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.
   The insurers actually could benefit. Industry analysts predicted
insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates
and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages
and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which
hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United
States earlier this month.
   An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater
profitability in the long term, the analysts said.
   ``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ... that
this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Despite their predictions for the long run, the analysts warned
that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely
to be disappointing.
   ``It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,''
said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based Langen
McAlenney.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, some insurance company stock
rose on Wednesday. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. rose $2.37{ to $59.50
a share; ITT Corp., parent of The Hartford, was up 37{ cents to
$59; and the Travelers Cos. rose $1 to $40.87{.
   Reinsurance companies, which absorb risk from policy writers,
did especially well. General Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 and
Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. rose $3.12{ to $75.87{.
   In California, earthquake insurance is an emotional and
politically-charged issue. Roughly two-thirds of all insurance
policies written in the United States are sold in California, where
many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred..
   Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer
earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required
to buy the coverage.
   Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to
commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property
with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said. They
estimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more,
business properties are insured.
   Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a
target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California
voters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback
in insurance rates. Insurers and state regulators are battling over
the rates and how they're set.

<HEAD>Earnings Sharply Higher in 3rd Qtr Due to Cable System Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times Co. said Wednesday its
earnings soared eightfold in the third quarter because of a onetime
gain on the sale of its cable television system.
   Excluding the gain, the company said income from continuing
operations fell 34.9 percent from the same period a year earlier.
   New York Times Co. said it earned $210.8 million, or $2.68 per
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $26.7
million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago.
   But the company said that excluding the after-tax gain of $193.3
million on the sale of NYT Cable TV and the income from its
operations prior to the sale date, income from continuing
operations fell to $16.4 million from $25.2 million.
   The decline stemmed from dilution due to recent magazine
acquisitions, lower equity earnings from the forest products group
and a decline in ad linage at The New York Times.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 6.4 percent to $415.3 million from
$390.5 million a year ago.
   For the first nine months of 1989, The New York Times Co. said
it earned $285.6 million, or $3.63 a share, compared with $117.2
million, or $1.44 a share, last year. The latest figures included
the gain on the cable sale.
   Nine-month revenue rose 4 percent to $1.30 billion from $1.25
billion a year earlier.
   Income from continuing operations fell to $87.2 million from
$112.5 million a year earlier.

   Wang Laboratories Inc. reported an expected
first-quarter loss Wednesday, as the struggling computer maker
showed the effects of a slowdown in the computer industry.
   Wang officials reported a first-quarter net loss Wednesday of
$62.1 million, or 38 cents per share, compared with net earnings of
$13.1 million, or 8 cents per share, during the same period last
year.
   The latest quarter's loss includes a $12.9 million, pre-tax
restructuring charge to cover the costs of employee severance
packages. The year-earlier quarter included a $3.1 million loss
from discontinued operations.
   Revenue for the first quarter was $596.8 million, down almost 13
percent from a restated $684 million during the same period last
year, Wang officials reported.
   ``The first quarter's results should not be a surprise to
anyone, and certainly there will be another loss in the second
quarter,'' said Richard W. Miller, Wang's president and chief
operating officer.
   However, he said he expected the company to return to
profitability in its fourth fiscal quarter, which ends next June.

<HEAD>Futures Firm Fined $500,000, Quits Merc</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CHICAGO _ A commodities trading firm agreed to pay a $500,000
fine and withdraw from membership in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange to settle charges of improper record-keeping and violating
margin requirements, exchange officials said Wednesday.
   The company, Capcom Futures Inc., withdrew from membership in
the Chicago Board of Trade last summer and a London-based
affiliate, Capcom Financial Services Ltd., was expelled from the
Board of Trade at the same time to settle rule violations similar
to those alleged by the Merc.
   The Merc said Capcom had neither admitted nor denied violating
exchange rules.
   Chicago-based Capcom Futures said in a statement that no
customers had been hurt by its actions and that the alleged
offenses were ``technical in nature and essentially involved
record-keeping matters.''
   The Merc said that on Oct. 6, 1988, in violation of exchange
margin requirements, Capcom accepted trades from a customer while
that customer had a debit balance in another trading account.
   On April 27, 1987, the Merc alleged, Capcom transferred nine
positions into a customer account from other, unaffiliated
customers accounts, a violation of exchange rules.
   The Merc also alleged that from April 1987 through October 1988,
Capcom failed to adequately document certain transactions among
Capcom and individuals and an entity directly or indirectly
controlled by shareholders of Capcom.
   Merc spokesoman Iris Poliski said a firm that withdraws from
exchange membership may re-apply for membership at any time.
   Withdrawal from exchange membership means a firm has voluntarily
left the exchange while expulsion means the firm has been ordered
out by the exchange, said Board of Trade spokesman Michael
O'Connell.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. said Wednesday its
third-quarter profit fell 23 percent, due in part to a decline in
research and development work on such projects as the B-2 stealth
bomber.
   Northrop, the focus of repeated investigations and much
congressional criticism for its performance on various government
contracts in recent years, said it earned $21.5 million, or 46
cents per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared
with a profit of $28.8 million, or 61 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
   Sales for the third quarter totaled $1.25 billion, down from
$1.36 billion a year earlier.
   The Los Angeles-based company said the B-2, which some in
Congress want to kill as too expensive, has passed the peak of its
development phase and is now in initial production at a low rate.
   The defense contractor, which lost $78.1 million in the second
quarter, also noted that it had made fewer deliveries of its F-A-18
fighters.
   Interest expense in the third quarter was $35 million, $18
million higher than in the same quarter last year. Debt at Sept. 30
was $1.22 billion, compared to $911 million a year earlier.
   Northrop stock closed down 25 cents at $21.12{ a share Wednesday
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. That put the
company's stock's market value below $1 billion _ a very low level
for a company with yearly revenues in the $6 billion range.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor's Profit Flat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp., the nation's
second-largest defense contractor, reported Wednesday its
third-quarter profit was virtually unchanged from the same quarter
last year.
   The St. Louis-based company said it earned $76.5 million, or
$1.83 a share, compared with $76.4 million, or $1.82 a share, in
1988's third quarter.
   Sales for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $2.5
billion, up from with $2.3 billion in last year's third quarter.
   Sales and profits for the first nine months of the year also
were flat.
   A spokesman said that higher-than-expected costs in the joint
development competition for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical
Fighter and delays in F-16 deliveries kept profits from rising in
the most recent quarter.
   The company did get a boost from big profit jumps in its
submarine, general aviation and construction materials
subsidiaries, which account for about 25 percent of its sales.
   ``General aviation experienced its best quarter since Cessna
Aircraft became part of General Dynamics four years ago,'' said
Stanley Pace, chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company said profit for the first nine months of the year
totaled $210 million, or $5.03 per share, on sales of $7.4 billion.
In the first three quarters of 1988, General Dynamics reported
earnings of $209 million, or $4.97 per share, on sales of $7.1
billion.
   Pace said that because the government has changed its method of
buying jets, tanks, submarines and other equipment, General
Dynamics has incurred higher interest expenses.
   For the third quarter, the company's interest expense rose to
$21.5 million, compared with $12.4 million for the same period a
year ago.
   ``These changes have raised the investment and capital
requirements of the defense industry,'' Pace said. ``And while
their impact on the industry is being felt today, their full impact
will be realized over the next several years.''

<HEAD>Campeau Corp. Takes Step To Ensure Supply of Christmas Merchandise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., fighting its way out of a
financial crisis, is taking steps aimed at assuring uninterrupted
supplies of merchandise to its Allied and Federated department
store divisions for the Christmas shopping season.
   Toronto-based Campeau, whose U.S. retailing operations are based
here, plans to use $80 million backed by letters of credit from the
Canadian Bank of Commerce for security to reassure merchandise
supply firms, Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   She said the credit is intended to reassure suppliers, called
factors, that serve as middlemen by paying manufacturers for goods
and then collecting payments from stores after shipment. The money
would provide additional credit if needed to guarantee shipments,
she said.
   ``It is just a security blanket,'' Ms. Sanger said in an
interview this week. ``It would cover any additional exposure we
might have for the holiday period.''
   Campeau, weighed down by heavy debt it took on to buy Federated
and Allied, suffered a financial and credibility crisis last month
until it obtained a $250 million loan.
   As a condition of making the loan, Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd. of Toronto made Toronto businessman Robert Campeau relinquish
control of his retailing and development company.
   The agreement called for up to $150 million of the loan to be
channeled to Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and the
remainder to its Allied Stores Corp. division.
   The money will allow the department store units to meet interest
payments now due on debt and to pay suppliers shipping merchandise
ahead of the critical Christmas season, the most lucrative
retailing time of the year.
   Stores owned by Campeau include the Cincinnati-based Lazarus
group; Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Strauss in New York; Maas
Brothers-Jordan Marsh in Florida; Burdine's in Miami; and Rich's in
Atlanta.

<HEAD>MGM Files $20 Million Suit Against Former Australian Buyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co. has filed a $20
million lawsuit against the domestic arm of its former suitor,
claiming Qintex America Ltd. has not made $3 million worth of
payments for a TV development deal.
   The complaint filed here Tuesday in U.S. District Court claims
Qintex has neglected to make payments for August, September and
October. The suit seeks $20 million in damages.
   MGM-UA claims Qintex agreed in April 1988 to a co-financing
venture involving American network television programming. The
contract is guaranteed by Qintex's parent, Qintex Australia Ltd.,
the complaint stated.
   A message left on the answering machine of Qintex spokesman
Daniel Saks after business hours Wednesday was not immediately
returned, and a receptionist reached after business hours at the
office of Qintex Entertainment spokesman Jonathan Lloyd said no one
was available to comment.
   MGM-UA annulled its $1.5 billion agreement to be bought by
Qintex Australia Ltd. last week, claiming Qintex failed to deliver
a $50 million letter of credit by a Sept. 22 deadline.
   MGM-UA previously filed a $50 million lawsuit in U.S. District
Court saying Qintex intentionally interfered with a $1.4 billion
offer for MGM-UA by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
   The movie studio had feared that Qintex would be unable to
finance the acquisition.

<HEAD>Investment Bankers Delay Two Junk Bond Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two investment houses said Wednesday they were
postponing two junk bond issues totaling more than $1.2 billion
because of the upheaval in the market for the high-risk, high-yield
securities.
   One of the offerings, for $1.1 billion, was for the Grand Union
Co., a supermarket operator. The second, for $156 million, was for
Ethan Allen &amp; Co., the furniture store chain.
   An official at Salmon Brothers Inc. told The New York Times that
it had ended its ``road show'' for the Grand Union offering, in
which the investment house travels around the nation to drum up
buyers for the bonds.
   A Salomon spokesman told the newspaper that the investment firm
was waiting for the junk bond market to settle down before it would
again try to sell the issue.
   A group that bought Grand Union last spring needed to issue the
bonds to help pay for the purchase from British financier Sir James
Goldsmith. The buyout group included Salomon.
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. said it delayed the Ethan Allen junk bond
sale until market conditions were calmer.
   ``We had hoped to start this week,'' said James A. Mullin, a
managing director at the firm. ``Things are pretty tough.''
   Ethan Allen was sold last year to a group of its managers by the
conglomerate Interco Inc.
   The junk bond market has been unsettled since last month when
Campeau Corp., the Canadian company than owns many U.S. department
store chains, said it would have trouble making payments on its
large junk-bond debt.
   The market took another hit when stock prices plunged Friday on
the news that a group seeking to buy airline company UAL Corp.
could not find financing. Junk bonds are so named because they are
issued by companies that have a poor credit rating.
